About the Author
Lee Ambrosius is a former resident of a cubicle community, which he resided in for about 8
years until deciding to go into business for himself. In 2005, Lee decided to venture off into
the CAD industry as an independent consultant for HyperPics, LLC in De Pere, Wisconsin, and
on the Web at www.hyperpics.com. He has been using AutoCAD since 1994 when he was
first exposed to Release 12 for DOS, and has been customizing and programming AutoCAD
since 1996. Lee has been an AutoCAD consultant and trainer for over a decade, and is both
an Autodesk Authorized Author and an Autodesk Authorized Developer.
Over the last decade, Lee has authored a variety of works that include articles for CAD maga-
zines, white papers for Autodesk, and has been a contributing author on a few occasions for
AutoCAD books. Lee is a co-author of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies. He has done technical editing for the three most recent editions of AutoCAD For
Dummies, and the four most recent editions of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT Bible. AutoCAD 2008
3D Modeling Workbook For Dummies is his first solo venture as a book author.
Dedication
To my parents, for believing in me and being there when I needed them the most, especially
when helping a broke college student purchase his first computer those many years ago
(even though you thought it wasn’t the best thing to do at the time).
Author’s Acknowledgments
I have to give a special thanks to Kristina, my wife, and my three kids, Isaac, Amber, and
Chloe, for letting me put in the long hours needed to complete this book. Thanks to all the
great folks at Wiley for being supportive through this entire project and giving me this great
opportunity to write this book.
Thanks to Shaan Hurley, Bud Schroeder, and many of the other great professionals at
Autodesk for taking the time to answer questions as they came up during this project. And
following close behind, and picking up the loose ends for me, is my technical editor Mark
Douglas. Mark is definitely not a stranger to AutoCAD, and is an up-and-coming individual in
the CAD community who is always willing to help out a fellow user in need.

Introduction
A
utoCAD is different from many other applications that you might already know and use
everyday, and that’s primarily due to how it has evolved over the past two decades.
The CAD industry is always striving for change in an attempt to improve the processes that
are used to create drawings. (CAD stands for Computer-Aided Drafting or Computer-Aided
Design, depending on whom you ask.) One of the latest trends that has started to take off
and redefine the industry in recent years is 3D modeling.
Although AutoCAD is primarily thought of as a CAD application used for 2D designs, it has a
powerful 3D modeling engine that allows you to create 3D models of buildings or small parts
used in a machine. 3D modeling in AutoCAD was introduced over a decade ago with AutoCAD
R13 (and even before that as an add-on called Autodesk Modeling Extension for AutoCAD R12),
but creating 3D models was very time consuming. In recent releases of AutoCAD, the 3D model-
ing features have been completely overhauled to allow conceptual designing in AutoCAD and
to create high-quality presentation renderings with less effort.
AutoCAD 2008 not only gives you the 2D drafting tools that you’ve come to use everyday, but
it also provides a robust set of tools for 3D modeling and visualizing the 3D models you can
create. This workbook helps you get up to speed fast with the 3D modeling features of
AutoCAD, allowing you to be more productive in a shorter period of time than if you tried to
go it alone.
About This Book
AutoCAD 2008 3D Modeling Workbook For Dummies gives you an understanding of all the fea-
tures that you need to know in order to work efficiently with 3D models in AutoCAD. This
book is different from other For Dummies books you might have read; it provides the infor-
mation that you need to know in order to work in 3D and gives you opportunities to try out
what you discover throughout the book.
The book is organized to allow you to work with procedural- and workflow-based exercises.
The procedural-based exercises allow you to try out the concepts covered in the book,
whereas the workflow-driven exercises give you an idea of how the concepts in the book are
applied when working on a 3D model.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you need to type text at the command line, in a dynamic input tooltip, in a text box, or
any other place, the text appears in bold typeface (for example, “Enter perspective at the
command line”). Examples of AutoCAD prompts appear in a special typeface.
At times, you might see something like the phrase “Choose File➪Save As.” The small arrow
(➪) in this example indicates that you are to choose the File menu and then choose the Save
As menu item.

Foolish Assumptions
You should know how to use the Windows operating system and understand the
basics of navigating folders and starting applications. To take advantage of everything
that is in this book and the features that AutoCAD offers, you need at least a dial-up
Internet connection (preferably a high-speed cable or DSL connection). As long as you
have AutoCAD installed on the computer in front of you and a connection to the
Internet, you’re ready to get started.
This book also assumes that you understand how to work with the 2D drafting features
of AutoCAD. If you need to brush up on your 2D skills, pick up AutoCAD & AutoCAD LT
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies.
How This Book Is Organized
The following sections describe the different parts that this book is organized into.
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD
Part I covers working with the user interface elements in AutoCAD and some of the basic
file management concepts that you should be familiar with before creating and modify-
ing 3D models. Chapter 1 focuses on the different user interface elements that AutoCAD
offers for changing settings and accessing commands related to 3D modeling along with
getting help when you might need it. Chapter 2 covers some basics of working with
drawing files, and Chapter 3 covers customizing the AutoCAD user interface to make
sure you have access to the commands that you want to use when you need them.
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D
Part II helps you transition your skills working on 2D drawings in AutoCAD to their 3D
equivalent. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the different types of 3D models that
you can create with AutoCAD and how to specify 3D coordinate values. Chapter 5
explains how to navigate around a 3D model as well as customizing how a 3D model is
displayed in the current view so you can better see how it looks. Chapter 6 takes a
look at the different drafting aids that you can use when modeling in AutoCAD, and it
covers some of the basic 3D objects that you can create. You also find out how to use
the general 3D modifying commands that you can use with 3D objects. Chapter 7 gives
you an opportunity to apply some of the topics covered in the other chapters from
this part in a workflow-driven approach to modeling in AutoCAD.
Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling
Part III focuses on modeling with 3D solids. Chapter 8 explains how to create 3D solids
as primitive objects such as boxes, cones, and cylinders, and it explains how to create
complex 3D solids by using some of the available operations like sweeping and lofting.
Chapter 9 focuses on modifying 3D solids and how to analyze your 3D models to make
sure that parts don’t interfere or intersect with each other. Chapter 10 provides infor-
mation on techniques that allow you to create 2D views from a 3D model to create a
set of shop drawings to manufacture the parts or illustrations that show how a part is
assembled. Chapter 11 offers additional exercises that cover many of the topics from
2
AutoCAD 2008 3D Modeling Workbook For Dummies 

the other chapters in this part in a workflow-driven approach to working with solid
models in AutoCAD.
Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces
Part IV focuses on modeling with 3D faces, meshes, and surface objects to create
3D surface models. Chapter 12 covers how to create 3D faces, planar meshes, mesh
primitives, and planar surface objects. Chapter 13 focuses on the creation of complex
meshes and surface objects using operations like revolving, lofting, and sweeping.
Chapter 14 explains how you can modify 3D faces, meshes, and surface objects after
you create them. Chapter 15 offers additional exercises that cover many of the topics
from the other chapters in this part in a workflow-driven approach to working with
surface models in AutoCAD.
Part V: Visualizing the Design
Part V takes you through the process of adding lighting and materials to a 3D model
before creating a photorealistic rendering. Chapter 16 covers creating various types of
lights in your models to show contrasts on surfaces with illuminated and shaded
areas. Chapter 17 focuses on creating and applying materials to 3D objects to give
them realistic colors and textures that represent how the objects in the model might
look after they’re manufactured and assembled. Chapter 18 introduces you to creating
a rendering from your 3D model after you add lights and materials to it. You also find
out about some of the advanced rendering features in Chapter 18 along with using the
animation features that come with AutoCAD. Chapter 19 contains additional exercises
that reinforce the topics covered in the other chapters from this part.
Part VI: Model Interchange
Part VI explains many of the different ways that you can share designs with others.
Chapter 20 focuses on creating layouts with floating viewports to create plotted views
of your 3D models and to configure a plotter to output raster image files. Chapter 21
introduces you to the different file formats that you can exchange your 3D models in
for both CAD and non-CAD users.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Part VII provides additional information that extend your experience with AutoCAD
and 3D modeling beyond this book. Chapter 22 provides an overview of the new
enhancements in AutoCAD 2008 that are related to both 2D drafting and 3D modeling.
Chapter 23 is packed full of links to AutoCAD Web sites that cover 2D drafting and 3D
modeling, along with links to industry-related Web sites where you can find informa-
tion about software add-ons to AutoCAD that can be used for analyzing 3D models or
sites with 3D models that you can use in your own models.
Appendixes
Appendix A provides a listing of some of the commonly used terms that are introduced
in this book, and it helps you to speak the 3D modeling lingo like a seasoned veteran.
Appendix B provides you with information about the files and videos that are on the
DVD that comes with this book.

Introduction

The DVD-ROM
The DVD-ROM that accompanies this workbook plays an intricate part in the workbook
experience. All the files for completing the exercises are contained on the DVD-ROM
along with the videos of select exercises that help explain the steps of an exercise if you
get stuck.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses the following icons to denote paragraphs that are of special interest:
This icon indicates a question-and-answer pairing that helps tie the concepts covered
under a topic with how you might use the concepts in the software. 
This icon indicates information that can help you complete a task faster or help you
not fall too far from the path of success. 
This icon indicates a video is available for an exercise. If you need some help completing
an exercise, you can watch the video to see how the exercise is completed step by step.
This icon gives you a dash of extra information if you haven’t had enough caffeine yet
for the day. AutoCAD is a complex program, and it takes time to put all the puzzle
pieces together, so use these friendly reminders to stay on the right track.
This icon helps you avoid potential pitfalls in AutoCAD that can get you into trouble.
Failure to adhere to the message may result in an undesired side effect to your 3D
model or additional work that could have been avoided.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized to allow you the freedom of moving from part to part or chap-
ter to chapter in any order that you want. However, each of the chapters build on con-
cepts that are covered in previous chapters of the book; so if you’re relatively new to
3D in AutoCAD, I recommended that you start at the front of the book and work your
way towards the back. If you’re experienced with AutoCAD, you might want to skim
through the first three chapters of the book and then dive into Chapter 4.
This book was written with the assumption that you already know how to use the 2D
drafting features of AutoCAD. Although I do cover many topics that cross over between
2D and 3D, I primarily focus on using features for 3D modeling. If you want to brush up
on the latest 2D drafting features in AutoCAD or some of the drawing precision tools
that AutoCAD offers, I suggest getting AutoCAD & AutoCAD LT All-in-One Desk Reference
For Dummies.
3D modeling isn’t something that you’ll be an expert at overnight, but completing the
exercises in this book and applying the techniques to your own projects can help you
to reach that next level in CAD design. No matter where your new found 3D modeling
skills take you, be sure to have fun.

Part I
Introducing AutoCAD

In this part . . .
A
utoCAD is a very powerful 2D drafting application,
but behind the user interface (toolbars, pull-down
menus, and drawing window) lie the capabilities of 
navigating and creating 3D models and generating 
presentation-quality images from 3D models to share 
with your clients. Before you begin navigating or creating
your own 3D models from 3D solids or surfaces or using
materials and user-defined lights to generate a photoreal-
istic rendering of a 3D model, you must become familiar
with how AutoCAD’s user interface works in 3D. To be 
proficient in 3D, you must understand all the different user
interface elements that are available in AutoCAD. When
you understand the elements of the user interface, you
can explore some of the basics of working with drawing
files and how to make sure the 3D tools and commands
that you want to use are accessible by customizing the
layout of AutoCAD’s user interface.

eing proficient with AutoCAD and its user interface can help make drafting tasks easier
based on how familiar you are with all the tools that are just a click away. The exercises
in this chapter give you an understanding of how to use the various interface elements that
AutoCAD has to offer to make sure you have the tools available when you need them.
The exercises in this chapter use the AutoCAD Classic workspace. To set the AutoCAD Classic
workspace current, choose Tools➪Workspaces➪AutoCAD Classic. For more information on
using and creating workspaces, see Chapter 3.
Launching AutoCAD
AutoCAD is one of the most popular computer-aided drafting applications on the market
today. You can use it to design plans for residential homes and complex drawings such as
paper-converting machines and circuit boards. To become efficient with AutoCAD, you
should get to know as many methods of launching the program as possible.
1.
How can you start AutoCAD?
A.
From the Start menu
B.
From a shortcut on the desktop, taskbar, or Quick Launch toolbar
C.
Insert the product CD/DVD into the CD/DVD-ROM
D.
By opening a drawing file
Exercise 1-1: Launching AutoCAD
In this exercise, you add a shortcut to the desktop, the Start menu, and the Quick Launch
toolbar. 
 Add an AutoCAD shortcut to the Windows desktop by creating a copy of the one
that appears in the AutoCAD 2008 folder. Choose Start➪(All) Programs➪Autodesk.
Right-click the AutoCAD 2008 icon and choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).

 Add a shortcut for AutoCAD to the Start menu. Right-click the AutoCAD short-
cut on the desktop and choose Pin to Start Menu.
 Add a shortcut for AutoCAD to the Quick Launch toolbar. Drag and drop the
AutoCAD shortcut from the desktop into place on the Quick Launch toolbar. If
the Quick Launch toolbar isn’t visible on the taskbar, right-click the taskbar and
choose Toolbars➪Quick Launch.
AutoCAD allows you to use what are called command line switches. Command line
switches automate some of the tasks that are normally performed each time you start
AutoCAD. Removing manual steps from the start-up process ensures that the drawings
you create are more consistent with each; then you can worry more about the models
that you need to create than all the intricate setup processes. You use them in con-
junction with desktop shortcuts that define the default template, workspace, and user
profile that are set up when AutoCAD first starts.
Command Line 
Description
Switch
/p
Allows you to specify which user profile to use when AutoCAD
starts. For information on user profiles, see Chapter 3.
/t
Allows you to specify which drawing template to use for the
default drawing that is created when AutoCAD launches. For more
information on drafting templates and creating a new drawing,
see Chapter 2.
/w
Allows you to specify which workspace to use when AutoCAD
starts. For information on user workspaces, see Chapter 3.
You can use more than one command line switch at a time with a shortcut; you just
need to use them correctly. Figure 1-1 shows an example of using the /t and /w com-
mand line switches.

Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Exercise 1-2: Customizing a Desktop Shortcut with Command Line Switches
In this exercise, you customize a desktop shortcut (see Exercise 1-1) to specify a tem-
plate for the default drawing and which workspace should be set current when
AutoCAD is first launched.
1. Access the Properties dialog box for your AutoCAD shortcut.
2. In the Properties dialog box, click the Shortcut tab.
3. On the Shortcut tab, position the cursor at the end of the path to the acad.exe
file in the Target text box and click.
4. Press the spacebar once to add a space after the executable file’s path. Then
enter this text:
/t acad3d.dwt /w “3D Modeling”
The /t command line switch uses the drawing template acad3d.dwt that ships
with AutoCAD to create the default drawing, and the /w command line switch
sets the 3D modeling workspace current. After you add the text in the Target text
box, the text looks like the following:
“C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2008\acad.exe” /t acad3d.dwt /w “3D
Modeling”
5. Click the General tab and change the name of the shortcut in the Name text box
near the top to My AutoCAD.
6. Click OK to save the changes.
7. Double-click the shortcut to test the changes made.
AutoCAD launches with the default drawing based on the acad3d.dwt file and
the 3D Modeling workspace is set current.
If the name of the drawing template, profile, or workspace contains a space, you must
wrap the name with double quotation marks in order for AutoCAD to interpret the
command line switches properly. 
For additional information on other command line switches that are available for use
with an AutoCAD shortcut, see the Customize Startup topic in the AutoCAD Online
Help system.
Navigating the User Interface
The AutoCAD user interface — or UI as it’s often referred to — can be very overwhelm-
ing, but it doesn’t have to be. All you need is some understanding of how things are
laid out and what the various UI elements are. AutoCAD, like other Windows-based
applications, has pull-down menus, toolbars, a document area, and a status bar area,
but AutoCAD also has some unique user interface elements that aren’t found in a lot 
of other applications. Some of the unique interface elements are a Command Line
window, dynamic input tooltips, and dockable windows. Figure 1-2 shows many of the
different user interface elements that are found in AutoCAD. 
9
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface
2.
In Exercise 1-2, you create a command line switch for AutoCAD. To access the shortcut proper-
ties in order to add a command line switch, right-click and choose _______________.

Drawing window
The drawing window (see Figure 1-3) is the main area in the middle of AutoCAD where
you add and modify objects in the designs that you create. When you create a new
drawing or open an existing drawing, a drawing window appears. Each open drawing
has its own drawing window. Along the bottom of each drawing window, you find these
items: 
 A series of tabs similar to those found in a spreadsheet program; these tabs repre-
sent where you create your model (Model tab) and the layouts used for plotting
different views of your model.
You can turn off the Model tab and layout tabs if you don’t want them displayed.
In their place are two buttons that allow you to switch to a different layout tab. 
 To the left of the tabs are navigation controls that allow you to scroll to the first,

of the drawing window at a time.
 The drawing status bar along the bottom displays settings specific to the drawing,
such as the current annotation scale. If you disable the drawing status bar, the
options are displayed in the status bar area of the application window instead.

Exercise 1-3: Navigating the Drawing Window
Practice using some of the user interface elements of the drawing window.
1. Create a new drawing based on the ANSI A (portrait) -Color Dependent
Plot Styles.dwt template that comes with AutoCAD.
In AutoCAD, choose File➪New. In the Select Template dialog box, select the ANSI
A (portrait) -Color Dependent Plot Styles.dwt template file and 
click Open. The drawing templates that come with AutoCAD are located in the
Templates folder at C:\Documents and Settings\user name\Local
Settings\Application Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2008\R17.1\enu;
substitute user name with your Windows login name.
Turn to Chapter 2 to find out how to create a new drawing.
2. Click the Model tab and layout tabs to view the contents of each one.
3. Right-click one of the tabs and choose Hide Layout and Model Tabs to toggle the
display for the layout tabs.
To display the tabs again, right-click the Model or Layout button in the status bar
area and choose Display Layout and Model Tabs.
4. View the contents of each of the layouts by clicking the Model and Layout but-
tons in the application window’s status bar; they’re displayed to the right of the
button labeled LWT (as shown in Figure 1-4).
5. Click the Status Bar Menu button to the left of the Clean Screen icon on the appli-
cation status bar (refer to Figure 1-2). Choose Drawing Status Bar. Make sure that
a check mark is next to Drawing Status Bar.
Some of the icons in the status bar tray move to the bottom of the drawing
window along with the controls for annotation scale.

6. Turn off the Drawing Status Bar setting.
Click the button to the right of the Layout button named Additional Layouts to
display a list of all the layouts in the drawing. 
Press Ctrl+Page Up to navigate to the previous layout or Ctrl+Page Down to navi-
gate to the next layout in the drawing.
Command Line window
The Command Line window by default is displayed between the drawing window and
the status bar area. If you don’t like its position, you can dock it above or along the left
or right side of the drawing window. The Command Line window plays a key role in
inputting commands, options, and values to create and modify objects; it also displays
command prompts and messages to let you know what AutoCAD is waiting for.
If you want to gain additional room in the AutoCAD application window, you can close
the Command Line window. Press Ctrl+9 to toggle the display of the Command Line
window on and off. When the Command Line window is hidden, command prompts
and options are displayed in dynamic tooltips. Press F12 to toggle the display of
dynamic tooltips. For more information on dynamic input, see the “Dynamic input”
section later in this chapter.
Text window
The Text window displays a running history of the commands and options that you
previously entered in the Command Line window or at the dynamic input tooltip. You
won’t need the Text window very often, but if you need to see what you did a few com-
mands ago, press F2 to bring up the Text window.
Status bar
The status bar allows you to quickly access drafting settings and other settings that are
used for some of the features. Most of the settings on the status bar allow you to toggle
drafting settings on or off without opening a dialog box or remembering a shortcut key
combination. Also, you can right-click most buttons to access options that allow you to
change the behavior of the drafting settings.

Exercise 1-4: Using the Status Bar
In this exercise, you create a new drawing and use some of the drafting settings that
are available on the status bar. 
1. Choose File➪New.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, double-click the acad.dwt drawing
template file.
13
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface

3. Choose Draw➪Line, or type line at the command prompt and press Enter.
4. Pick a point in the drawing window to start drawing a line.
5. On the status bar, click DYN until the button appears popped out. When a button
is popped out, the drafting setting is turned off, and in this case you toggled
Dynamic Input off.
Move the crosshairs in the drawing window; no dynamic input tooltips are dis-
played trailing the crosshairs. The dynamic input tooltip is an extension of the
Command Line window that displays the current command prompt and input
boxes that allow you to specify coordinate values, distances, or angles among
other values for the current command. For more information on dynamic input,
see the “Dynamic input” section later in this chapter. 
6. Turn on Dynamic Input.
Move the crosshairs in the drawing window; the dynamic input tooltips display
trailing the crosshairs. With the LINE command active yet, you should see the
command prompt Specify next point and a down arrow that allows you to
access the available command options. After the command prompt, you see two
input boxes that allow you to specify the X- and Y-coordinate values for the end
point for the line.
7. Turn on ortho mode.
Move the crosshairs in the drawing window; you can draw a straight line only in
90-degree increments starting with 0 because ortho mode constrains the coordi-
nate value horizontal or vertical from the previous point specified.
8. Turn off ortho mode.
You can now create a line at any angle that you want to.
9. Press Esc to exit the LINE command.
Exercise 1-5: Controlling the Display of Controls on the Status Bar
For this exercise, open a drawing (a new one or one from a previous exercise). Practice
controlling the display of controls on the status bar. 
1. On the right side of the status bar area, click the Status Bar Menu button
(located to the left of the Clean Screen icon).
2. Select the controls that you want to display or hide on the status bar.
The items selected are displayed, and the ones that aren’t selected are currently
hidden. It’s a good idea to display only the controls that you frequently use.
Status bar tray
On the right side of the status bar is an area called the status bar tray. The status bar
tray provides access, via an icon, to features that you’re currently using in the active
drawing or AutoCAD. When the icon for a feature is displayed, you can click or right-
click the icon to access settings and other options for the feature. As you work in a
drawing, certain situations cause a notification balloon to be displayed. The notifica-
tion balloon lets you know when you’ve done something that affects your drawing,
such as adding a new layer that doesn’t match the current set of CAD standards or
completing a background plot. You can control the display of many of the icons or
toggle on and off the display of the status bar tray.

Exercise 1-6: Controlling the Display of Icons and Notification Balloons
For this exercise, open a drawing (a new one or one open from a previous exercise).
Practice changing the global settings for the status bar tray and notification balloons. 
1. On the right side of the status bar, click the Status Bar Menu button (located to
the left of the Clean Screen icon).
2. Choose Tray Settings.
3. In the Tray Settings dialog box, click Display Icons from Services so it’s
deselected.
4. Click OK.
The status bar tray is now hidden, with the exception of the Status Bar Menu and
Clean Screen buttons.
15
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface

5. Open the Tray Settings dialog box, re-enable Display Icons from Services, and
select Display Time and 5 seconds from the drop-down list.
The notification balloons now close automatically after 5 seconds.
6. Click OK.
Toolbars
Toolbars are some of the most commonly used user interface elements in a Windows-
based application. Toolbars allow you to quickly access commands from an organized
grouping of tools instead of using pull-down menus. A toolbar contains buttons that
you click to activate a command, and it has controls that allow you to select an option
from a drop-down list or enter text into a text box.
Some toolbars contain flyouts, which have multiple tools on them that perform similar
tasks. A flyout on a toolbar is indicated by a button displaying a black arrow in the
lower-right corner of the button’s image. 
Figure 1-5 shows the main parts of a toolbar. 
You can dock toolbars along the edge of the application window, or you can have them
floating. The state that the toolbar is in doesn’t affect how the buttons and controls
work, but if a toolbar that contains a drop-down list is docked on the left or right side
of the application window, the control isn’t displayed. When a toolbar is docked, the
gripper bar is displayed at the top or left side of the toolbar based on how it’s docked;
if the toolbar is floating, a title bar appears at the top with the name of the toolbar.
Most people prefer toolbars to pull-down menus because they offer quick access to
commonly used commands, and toolbar icons make the commands easy to recognize.
AutoCAD comes with 37 toolbars, but you can create your own custom commands and
toolbars to access the commands that you use on a regular basis with ease. For more
information on creating your own custom commands and toolbars, see Chapter 3.
Exercise 1-7: Displaying, Hiding, and Repositioning a Toolbar
For this exercise, open a drawing (a new one or one from a previous exercise). Practice
displaying, hiding, and repositioning a toolbar.
1. Right-click any displayed toolbar and choose 3D Navigation from the shortcut
menu to display the 3D Navigation toolbar.
Toolbars that are currently displayed have a check mark next to them on the
shortcut menu, and the ones that are hidden don’t.

2. If the 3D Navigation toolbar is currently docked, click the gripper bar and drag
the toolbar over the drawing window.
You can lock the position of toolbars and dockable windows by clicking the
Toolbars/Window Lock icon in the status bar tray.
3. Click the title bar of the 3D Navigation toolbar and drag the toolbar along the left
side of the application window of AutoCAD. Release the mouse button to dock
the toolbar.
When the toolbar gets close enough to be docked, the drag preview of the tool-
bar switches from a horizontal to a vertical orientation.
Hold down Ctrl when dragging a toolbar or dockable window to keep it from
docking along the edge of the application window.
4. Close the toolbar.
Menus
Menus — or pull-down menus — are located on the menu bar and allow you to access
more commands than any other user interface in AutoCAD (other than the command
prompt). You can find most of the commands that you need when working on a draw-
ing on one of the 12 menus in AutoCAD. The menus in AutoCAD contain commands
that have been organized into related groups; for instance, commands that create
objects are on the Draw menu, and ones used for dimensioning are on the Dimension
menu. The main menus that are available in AutoCAD are located along the top of the
application window. When clicked, they appear to drop down from the main menu’s
name.
AutoCAD also offers context-sensitive menus that are available when you right-click
the drawing window. Context-sensitive menus offer different options based on whether
a command is active or even whether any objects are selected in the drawing before
you right-click. Both the main and shortcut menus use submenus to organize options
that are similar. Submenus are indicated by a small black arrow that points to the
right.
Menu items use special indicators that let you know what happens when you click or
access the item without using the menu in the future:
 A series of 3 periods (. . .): A dialog box displays when you choose the menu item.
 Shortcut key combination: The keyboard command is displayed to the right of
the menu item’s caption. For example, Ctrl+N is displayed next to the New menu
item. You can press Ctrl+N to start the NEW command.
If you hold down Shift before right-clicking, you can access the Object Snap Cursor
menu, which allows you to select an object snap override.
Dockable windows
Dockable windows — or palettes — are one of the newest user interfaces in AutoCAD.
They allow you to access settings and options without the need of closing them when
you’re done. AutoCAD offers a number of dockable windows that allow you to modify
the properties of an object; calculate distances; convert values to different units of
measurement; access reusable objects (blocks, materials, and visual styles) when creat-
ing or modifying a drawing; or work with sheet sets. AutoCAD comes with 14 dockable
windows, and you can launch most of them by choosing Tools➪Palettes. 
17
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface

You can dock, as the name implies, dockable windows or have them float like a toolbar.
However, when docked or floating, a dockable window can still take up a moderate
amount of space in AutoCAD, which can reduce the available space you have for the
drawing window. That’s why you can auto-hide dockable windows. The Auto-hide set-
ting collapses the dockable window when the cursor isn’t over it, which helps to reduce
it to the same size as a docked toolbar. Figure 1-6 shows the common controls that all
dockable windows have in common. Manipulating the position and display of a dock-
able window is similar to manipulating a toolbar.
Exercise 1-8: Manipulating the Display of a Dockable Window
For this exercise, open a drawing (a new one or one from a previous exercise). Practice
displaying, auto-hiding, and repositioning a dockable window.
1. Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Properties.
2. If the Properties window is currently docked, click the gripper bar and drag it
over the drawing window.
3. Click the Auto-hide control on the title bar.
The dockable window collapses, and only the title bar is displayed. Moving the
crosshairs/cursor over the title bar causes it to expand.
4. Click the title bar and drag the palette to the right of the drawing window. Release
the mouse button when the preview of the palette changes to dock the palette.
Hold down Ctrl when dragging a toolbar or palette to keep it from docking along
the edge of the application window.

Giving AutoCAD Directions
As you might have noticed by all the different user interfaces that AutoCAD offers, you
can start commands and input options in a number of ways. You can use commands to
start a specific task that displays prompts or a dialog box for input. 
The easiest way to start a command is to type it in the Command Line window. After
you start a command, you do one of the following:
 Provide input if a prompt is displayed in the Command Line window or at a
dynamic input tooltip.
 Provide input in the controls of a dialog box that is displayed.
 Nothing; the command simply ends because no input is required.
19
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface
3.
Besides typing the command at the command prompt, how else can you start a command?
A.
Choose a menu item from a pull-down menu or shortcut menu.
B.
Use the Command Prompt window in Windows.
C.
Use a toolbar or the dashboard.
It’s all in the name
Not all commands in AutoCAD are created equally: You can use some commands when
other commands are in use, whereas you can use certain commands only when no other
command is active. When you’re using a command that creates or modifies an object,
the command is usually a modal command that supports being used when another com-
mand is active. To use a command, you simply enter its name at the command prompt
and press Enter or select the associated user interface element to start a command.
When entering command names and options at the command prompt, press the space-
bar in most cases to start a command or option. The spacebar acts like the Enter key
unless the input that is being requested contains a space.
Transparent commands
You can use some commands in AutoCAD when a command is already active; these
commands are known as transparent commands. (You can also use transparent com-
mands when no command is active.) To use a command transparently, enter an apos-
trophe (‘) in front of the command’s name. Transparent commands affect the properties
of a new object when it’s being created or affect the display of the drawing.

For the most part, you don’t need to worry about entering an apostrophe (‘) in front of
the command’s name when using a menu or toolbar to start a command because it’s
part of the macro for the user interface element. 
Command alias
AutoCAD uses command aliases as an option to starting commands. A command alias is
an abbreviation that is assigned to a command. It’s used to access a command from the
command prompt without having to enter its full name. Command aliases are typically
one to three characters in length, but some aliases are longer. Examples of some aliases
are L for the LINE command and 3DO for 3DORBIT. Command aliases are stored in a file
named acad.pgp and are loaded automatically when you start AutoCAD.
Although AutoCAD ships with a number of command aliases, you can add your own
command aliases. They’re stored in the acad.pgp file. To open it, choose Tools➪
Customize➪Edit Program Parameters (acad.pgp). For additional information on creat-
ing and modifying command aliases, see the Define Custom Commands topic in the
Online Help system of AutoCAD. After modifying the acad.pgp file, you have to either
close and restart AutoCAD for the changes to take effect or use the REINIT command
to reload all the aliases in the acad.pgp file without restarting AutoCAD.
If you don’t remember the full name of a command but know the first few letters of it,
you can enter those at the command prompt and then press Tab until you find the
command you are looking for. After the command’s name is displayed at the command
prompt, press Enter to use it.
Repeating a command
When you’re working in a drawing, you sometimes want to use the same command
multiple times in a row. AutoCAD allows you to repeat the previous command without
having to select it from a user interface element again, making it much more efficient
to continue using the command.
You can use these methods to repeat a previously used command:
 Press Enter when no command is active.
 Press the spacebar when no command is active.
 Press the Up arrow key when no command is active and press Enter. You can
step back to retrieve previously used commands within the current session and
not just the most recently used command.
 Right-click the drawing window and choose Repeat Command Name.
 Right-click the drawing window and choose Recent Input➪command_name.
 Right-click the Command Line window and choose Recent
Commands➪command_name.
Canceling the current command
Sometimes you might find yourself using a command, and all of a sudden you want to
stop using it and switch to a different one. If you don’t want to complete the current
command, press Esc or right-click and choose Cancel from the contextual menu. 
20
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Before you press Esc, make sure that you don’t want to complete the current com-
mand. When you press Esc, you might lose some of the changes that you made.
Exercise 1-9: Starting and Canceling a Command
For this exercise, create a new drawing and set the AutoCAD Classic workspace cur-
rent. Then practice starting and canceling commands from a menu, toolbar, and com-
mand prompt. 
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Box.
2. Click a point in the drawing window.
3. At the command prompt, enter ‘pan and press Enter.
4. Click in the drawing window and drag in any direction to pan. When you’re
finished panning, press Enter to resume the BOX command.
5. Right-click and choose Cancel to end the BOX command.
The BOX command exits without adding a new object to the drawing.
6. Click the Erase icon on the Modify toolbar.
7. Press Esc to cancel the ERASE command.
8. At the command prompt, enter co and press Enter.
CO is the command alias for the COPY command, so the COPY command starts.
9. Exit the COPY command with the method of your choice.
10. Repeat the last command with the method of your choice.
Press Enter or the spacebar or use one of the options from a shortcut menu.
Dynamic input
Dynamic input allows you to get prompts near the location of the crosshairs without
having to look up and down between the Command Line window and the drawing
window. Not only does dynamic input allow you to save on some neck strain, but it
keeps your focus in the drawing window where you do most of your work inside
AutoCAD.
Based on the current settings of dynamic input when it is enabled, AutoCAD provides
feedback to you on the current location of the crosshairs when no command is active
and then provides multiple ways to specify coordinates and values when certain com-
mands are active. For example, when the LINE command is active, dynamic input
tooltips allow you to input the X and Y coordinate for the line object to start at. Then
when the first point is selected, two dynamic input dimensions are displayed: one for
the distance of the line and the second for the angle of the time. For more information
on changing the way dynamic input works, see Chapter 3.
Dialog boxes
Command line input and options are the most common forms of providing information
to AutoCAD, but in some cases, it can be a complex process. When you can benefit
from a dialog box instead of a command line, a dialog box is provided. As in many
21
Chapter 1: AutoCAD and the User Interface

other Windows-based applications, dialog boxes in AutoCAD collect information from
you through standard controls such as text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, and
drop-down lists. You can display dialog boxes in two different states: modal and mode-
less. Modal dialog boxes don’t allow you to do anything else in AutoCAD until the
dialog box has been closed; a modeless dialog box allows you to interact with AutoCAD
while it’s displayed. Dockable windows (palettes) are a form of a modeless dialog box. 
Many commands display a dialog box as the primary form of input, but they also allow
you to input information using the command prompt. In most cases, adding a hyphen
(-) in front of the command’s name switches the command from a dialog box to the
command prompts. For example, the HATCH command displays a dialog box, but the 
-HATCH command displays a series of command prompts instead.
Some dialog boxes, such as the Options dialog box, don’t offer a single command to
access the options found in the dialog box, but rather many different commands and
system variables. As an example, if you want to disable background plotting, you use
the system variable BACKGROUNDPLOT because there is no -OPTIONS command. For
more information on system variables and the Options dialog box, see Chapter 3.
Some commands such as NEW and OPEN don’t have equivalent commands that start
with a hyphen but instead rely on the system variable FILEDIA. Set FILEDIA to 0 (zero),
and the commands display prompts instead of the Standard File Navigation dialog box.
Sending an S.O.S. to AutoCAD
AutoCAD is a very complex application that offers a lot of different tools to help with
many different general drafting tasks and some that are much more specific to an
industry. With all this complexity, there are times when you need a little help to keep
you on track with learning something new or trying to complete a task. The Online
Help system that AutoCAD offers does a pretty good job of giving answers to both gen-
eral and specific problems, but because AutoCAD is used by a very large, diverse
group of people, you might not find all the answers in the Online Help system.
Fortunately, because AutoCAD has a large user base, usually someone has encoun-
tered the specific problem that you have and might even have posted the solution on
the Internet in one of the many online forums out there.
Online help
The Online Help system that comes with AutoCAD is very complete for the most part,
with a few minor potholes here and there. The Online Help system is well integrated in
AutoCAD, and you can access it just about anywhere in the application to get context-
sensitive help when you need it most. To access help, choose Help➪Help or enter help
at the command prompt.
InfoCenter
InfoCenter (see Figure 1-7) replaces the Info Palette from previous versions and com-
bines the functionality of the Communication Center in one place. The InfoCenter is
located in the upper-right corner of AutoCAD on the menu bar and allows you to
search for information in the Online Help system as well as get information from your
favorite blogs or Web sites that post content in an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) file
22
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

format. If you find a specific topic or entry of interest, you can flag it as a favorite,
which allows you to easily go back to the topic at a later date.
Exercise 1-10: Searching for Information Using InfoCenter
Practice searching for information in AutoCAD using the InfoCenter.
1. Click in the Search field and enter create 3D box.
2. Press Enter to start the search.
3. Position the cursor over the Create a Solid Box entry and click the star to the
right of the link.
The link is now marked as a favorite.
4. Click the Favorites button located on the right-side of the InfoCenter (refer to
Figure 1-7) and click the link that you added.
AutoCAD’s Online Help system launches and displays the topic.
5. Close the Online Help system and click the Communication Center.
Browse through the topics shown. (The information is pulled from a number of
different resources.) You can add your favorite RSS feeds to InfoCenter, which
AutoCAD searches when you use the Search field of InfoCenter.
6. Click the down arrow to the right of the InfoCenter Search button, and choose
Search Settings from the shortcut menu.
7. In the InfoCenter Settings dialog box, select RSS Feeds from the left pane, and
click New.

Turning to the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web is a great resource for selling or buying things, but it also hap-
pens to be a great place to get help on AutoCAD. The Internet is bursting with sites
that offer information on AutoCAD and help when you’re stuck. Chances are good that
you can use a popular search engine such as Google (www.google.com) or Yahoo!
(www.yahoo.com) to find a solution to a problem that you might be having with
AutoCAD. If you can’t find a solution to your problem using a search engine, you can
use an online community site like AUGI (www.augi.com) or the online discussion
forums that Autodesk supports (www.autodesk.com/discussion) to post your
problem and wait for someone to respond with a solution. In addition to these Web
sites, I list resources on the Internet in Chapter 23.

You do a lot of work with drawing files when using AutoCAD; the main byproduct of
AutoCAD is a drawing file, which has the file extension DWG. The exercises in this
chapter give you an understanding of how to create, open, save, manage, and navigate
drawing files in AutoCAD.
Creating a New Drawing
When you first start AutoCAD, it creates a default drawing automatically, but commonly you
don’t want to use this default drawing when creating a new drawing (unless you use a custom
shortcut to specify a drawing template). To create a new drawing file, you use either the NEW
or QNEW command.
The /t command line switch allows you to specify a drawing template that contains items
such as layers, blocks, and other drawing-related options and objects that you want to have
access to when creating a new drawing. Chapter 1 covers command line switches.
You can create a new drawing in the following ways:
 Choose File➪New and select a drawing template, start from scratch, or use the wizard.
 Click Qnew on the Standard toolbar and select a drawing template if a default template
isn’t set up.
 Press Ctrl+N and select a drawing template, start from scratch, or use the wizard.
When you create a new drawing, you can use a drawing template which contains the pre-
defined formats and settings you want to use, or you can create a drawing from scratch 
using all the default settings that are defined by AutoCAD for a drawing. By default, the NEW

command displays the Select Template dialog box, which allows you to create a draw-
ing by using a template or starting from scratch, but if the STARTUP system variable is
set to 1 instead of the default value 0, the Create New Drawing dialog box is displayed
instead. The Create New Drawing dialog box allows you to create a new drawing by
using a drawing template, starting from scratch, or using one of the wizard options.
Drawing templates
AutoCAD ships with a number of drawing template files that you can choose from, or
you can create your own template based on the settings that you want preset. A draw-
ing template is just like a drawing file except it has the DWT file extension. When you
use a template to create a new drawing, AutoCAD gives the new drawing a default
name instead of opening an existing drawing and saving the file with a different name.
The default name that’s assigned to a drawing file when using a drawing template is
Drawing1, Drawing2, and so on. By not opening and saving a drawing file with a dif-
ferent name, you avoid the issue of accidentally saving over the file.
Drawing template files are stored by default on your local drive, but if you’re working
in a large group of individuals who need to use the same set of drawing templates, you
can tell AutoCAD to look for them on a network drive instead. To specify a new path
for the drawing templates, choose Template Settings➪Drawing Template File Location.
The Options dialog box appears, and you can change the path on the Files tab.
Exercise 2-1: Creating a New Drawing from a Template
Practice creating a new drawing based on a drawing template file.
1. Choose File➪New.
The Select Template dialog box lists the drawing template files that are indicated
in the path set in the Options dialog box.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, select the drawing template file to use and
click Open.
A new drawing named Drawing2 is created. Subsequent new drawings are
named Drawing3, Drawing4, and so on.
3. Close the drawing without saving it.
Choose File➪Close or the X button in the upper-right corner of the drawing
window.
26
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 
1.
To specify a default drawing template when creating a new drawing, enter _______________ at
the command prompt to use the _______________ command. 
Exercise 2-2: Creating a Custom Template
Practice creating a new custom drawing template.
1. Create a new drawing using the acad.dwt drawing template file.
2. Add two new layers to the drawing called Center and Dims with the colors 5 and 6,
respectively.

To add a new layer, first choose Format➪Layer to display the Layer Properties
Manager. In the Layer Properties Manager, click New Layer and enter the name
Center. Click in the Color column for the Center layer and change the color to
color 5 on the ACI tab. Create the Dim layer and assign it the color 6 by using the
same steps that you used to create the Center layer.
3. Add other objects such as blocks, dimension styles, or anything else that you
might want to be part of the drawing template.
You can use the DesignCenter to add named objects from one drawing to another
drawing that you have open. This can help you save time when creating a drawing
template with the layers and styles that might already exist in another drawing.
4. Choose File➪Save As.
5. In the Save Drawing As dialog box, select AutoCAD Drawing Template (*.dwt)
from the Files of Type drop-down list.
6. In the File Name text box, enter the name MyTemplate.
7. Under My Documents, open the My Practice Drawings folder and then browse to
the Chapter 2 folder.
8. Click Save.
9. In the Template Description dialog box, highlight the text that’s present and
enter My Custom Drawing Template.
10. Select English from the Measurement drop-down list and click OK.
11. Close the current drawing.
12. Create a new drawing by using the My Template.dwt file.
Display the Layer Properties dialog box, and the two layers that you added to
the drawing template exist in the drawing.
13. Close the drawing without saving it.
Starting from scratch
When creating a new drawing, you have the option to create a new drawing from
scratch rather than basing it on a drawing template. The only options you have to
choose from are the Imperial (inches, feet, and so on) and Metric (millimeter, meter,
and so on) measurement options, which affect the linetypes and hatch patterns used
for the drawing; otherwise, the drawing file is created with all the default drawing set-
tings, and no named objects, such as layers or text styles, are created in the drawing.
Exercise 2-3: Creating a Drawing from Scratch
Practice creating a new drawing from scratch with the Imperial measurement setting.
1. Choose File➪New.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, click the drop-down arrow next to the Open
button and click Open with No Template - Imperial.
A new drawing is created with only the measurement setting set to Imperial and
all other settings set to their default values.
3. Close the drawing without saving it.
27
Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files

Calling upon the wizard
The wizard options that come with AutoCAD really aren’t used for production draw-
ings because they’re rather limited in the settings that they can control, but they’re
nice for creating custom drawing templates because they help you set up some of the
very basic drawing settings. Everything the wizard offers can be done manually with
the help of a few commands that are in AutoCAD.
Exercise 2-4: Creating a Drawing with the Use a Wizard Option
Practice creating a new drawing using the Use a Wizard Option of the Create New
Drawing dialog box.
1. At the command prompt, enter startup and press Enter.
2. At the prompt Enter new value for STARTUP <0>:, enter 1 and press
Enter.
3. Choose File➪New.
4. In the Create New Drawing dialog box, click Use a Wizard.
5. Select Advanced Wizard and click OK.
The Quick Wizard offers fewer options than the Advanced Wizard does, so be
sure to select the Advanced Wizard.
6. Select Decimal for the unit of measurement and 0.000 from the Precision drop-
down list. Click Next.
7. Select Decimal Degrees for the angle of measurement and 0.00 from the Precision
drop-down list. Click Next.
8. Click Next to keep 0 degrees in the direction of East.
9. Click Next to keep positive angle entry going in the counterclockwise direction.
10. Enter 17 in the Width text box and 11 in the Length text box. Click Finish.
The Advanced Wizard sets the drawing and angular units, along with the Model
space limits for the drawing. To set both the drawing and angular units of a
drawing, use the UNITS command, and to set the drawing limits, use the LIMITS
command.
11. Change the STARTUP system variable back to a value of 0 (zero) by completing
Steps 1 and 2, and when prompted for a new value enter 0 instead of 1.
12. Close the drawing without saving it.
Opening an Existing Drawing
After you create a drawing, it’s only a matter of time until you need to reopen it to make
some revisions or plot it off for someone to review. AutoCAD allows you to open drawing
files (DWG), drawing template files (DWT), drawing standards files (DWS), and drawing
exchange files (DXF). Choose File➪Open and then browse to the file you want.
28

Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files
2.
Besides choosing File➪Open, how else can you open an existing drawing?
A.
Choose File➪Re-open and select the drawing file to open.
B.
Choose a drawing from the most recent list at the bottom of the File menu.
C.
Click Open on the Standard toolbar and select the drawing file to open.
D.
Press Ctrl+O and select a drawing file to open.
Exercise 2-5: Opening a Drawing File
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise2-5.dwg from the Chapter 2 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice opening an
existing drawing file. 
1. Choose File➪Open.
2. In the Select File dialog box, select Drawing (*.dwg) from the Files of Type drop-
down list.
If you want to open a drawing standard, drawing template, or drawing exchange
file, just select the appropriate option from the Files of Type drop-down list.
3. Browse to and select the drawing file Exercise2-5.dwg from the Chapter 2
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents, and click Open.
4. Minimize AutoCAD by clicking the Minimize button located in the upper-right
corner of the application window.
5. Use the AutoCAD 2008 shortcut on your desktop to start a second session of
AutoCAD.
6. In the new session of AutoCAD, browse to and open the Exercise2-5.dwg file. 
7. When prompted to open the file in read-only mode, click Yes.
The message box lists the name of the computer that the file is currently opened
on. This can be helpful if you need to work on a drawing that someone else
has open. 
8. At the command prompt, enter whohas and press Enter.
WHOHAS allows you to retrieve who currently has a drawing file open and when
it was opened. This can be helpful when working on a project that has multiple
drafters assigned to it.
9. In the Select Drawing to Query dialog box, browse to and open the
Exercise2-5.dwg file again.
A message box displays the path to the drawing, along with the computer that it
is opened on and when it was opened. 
10. Close both sessions of AutoCAD without saving the changes to the drawing.
If your drawing file contains named views, you can click the Select Initial View
option to choose a named view when the drawing is being opened.
At times, you might want to open a drawing to only view or plot it. To avoid acci-
dentally saving changes to the file, you can click the drop-down arrow next to
the Open button and select Open Read-Only to mark the file as read-only. Using
the Open Read-Only option doesn’t affect the actual read-only attribute of the
drawing file located on the hard drive or network drive.

Navigating Drawing Windows
After you start creating and opening drawing files, chances are good that you’ll quickly
find out that AutoCAD allows you to have multiple drawing files open at a time. AutoCAD
allows you to work with multiple drawing files just like most other Windows-based appli-
cations do. You can select one of the open drawings from the Window menu, arrange
the drawings in the document area by tiling or cascading them, or press Ctrl+Tab and
Ctrl+Shift+Tab to cycle through the open drawing files.
Having the ability to work with multiple drawings open at a time is great, but it does
take some additional understanding of how to work efficiently with them, and it does
take additional resources. Be sure you need more than one drawing open at a time. 
Exercise 2-6: Arranging Drawing Windows
Practice arranging multiple drawing windows.
1. Create two new drawings or open two existing drawings that you have already
created.
2. Choose Window➪Cascade.
The drawing windows are no longer maximized and are arranged starting in the
upper-left corner of the document area stacked diagonally towards the lower-
right corner. The drawing windows are arranged so you can see the title bars of
each open drawing but not the drawing area of each one.
3. Choose Window➪Tile Horizontally.
The drawing windows are now arranged so they’re displayed one above the
other in the document area. You can see the title bar and the drawing window of
both the open drawings.
4. Choose Window➪Tile Vertically.
The drawing windows are now arranged so they are displayed side by side in the
document area. You can see the title bar and the drawing window of both the
open drawings.
5. Close the drawings without saving them.
AutoCAD allows you to copy content between drawings by dragging from one
drawing and dropping into another one. If you drag and drop with the left mouse
button, you can copy and paste from one drawing to another. If you drag and
drop between drawings with the right mouse button, you get options to perform
a copy, paste as a block, or paste to original coordinates on the shortcut menu. 
Exercise 2-7: Switching between Open Drawings
Practice switching between open drawings.
1. Create three new drawings; you don’t need to save the drawings.
2. Watch the title bar of AutoCAD or the current drawing window, and press
Ctrl+Tab.
If the drawing windows are maximized, the name of the drawing is changed in
the title bar of AutoCAD and if the drawing windows are tiled, the focus of the
current drawing window switches to the previous one that was active.
30
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Exercise 2-8: Saving a Drawing File
Practice opening an existing drawing.
1. Create a new drawing.
2. Choose File➪Save.
3. In the Save Drawing As dialog box, enter the name P04235-B in the File Name
text box and specify the location to save the drawing in.
4. Select AutoCAD 2007 Drawing (*.dwg) from the Files of Type drop-down list.
If you need to save the drawing to an older format for someone else to open,
select the appropriate option from the File of Type drop-down list.
31
Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Tab, and watch the title bar of AutoCAD or the current drawing
window.
Ctrl+Shift+Tab is like Ctrl+Tab; the only difference is the direction that the open
drawings are cycled in.
4. Choose Window➪drawing name to activate a specific drawing file that’s open.
5. Close the drawings without saving them.
If you have more than nine drawings open at a time, click the More Windows
option at the bottom of the Window menu to display the Select Window dialog
box, which allows you to see a list of all the drawings that you currently
have open.
Saving Drawings
After you’ve worked on your design for a little while, saving it is a good idea so you
don’t lose any of your work up to the current point. Saving a drawing in AutoCAD isn’t
much different from other Windows-based applications.
You can save drawings with these methods:
 Choose File➪Save, and enter a name and path for the drawing if prompted for one.
 Click Save on the Standard toolbar.
 Enter save at the command prompt and enter a name and path for the drawing if
prompted for one.
 Press Ctrl+S.
3.
Name three ways to save a drawing with a different name.
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________

5. Under My Documents, open the My Practice Drawings folder and then browse to
the Chapter 2 folder.
6. Click Save.
7. Close the drawing.
You can change the default drawing format when saving to an older release if you
need to. This allows you to not have to remember selecting a different format
from the Files of Type drop-down list. To change the default file format when
saving a drawing, select the format from the Save As drop-down list on the Open
and Save tab of the Options dialog box (choose Tools➪Options).
After you save a drawing more than once, AutoCAD renames the previous drawing file
as a backup drawing with the file extension BAK. The backup drawing file allows you
to recover the previous version of the drawing file that was saved. Backup drawing
files come in handy if AutoCAD unexpectedly crashes due to an error in the applica-
tion or if your computer crashes.
You should save your drawings as often as you can to eliminate any work that might
be lost if your computer loses power or AutoCAD crashes unexpectedly. As an addi-
tional safeguard against losing your work, AutoCAD offers a feature called AutoSave,
which performs a save after a specific time interval. You can customize the time inter-
val on the Open and Save tab of the Options dialog box (choose Tools➪Options) under
the File Safety Precautions section. When the time interval is reached, AutoCAD saves
a file with the extension SV$ to the path specified under the Temporary Drawing File
Location specified on the Files tab of the Options dialog box. A drawing autosave (SV$)
file is a drawing file, just with a different extension; when you change the SV$ exten-
sion to DWG, you can open the file in AutoCAD again.
Password-protecting your documents
If you find yourself sharing files with others outside of your office, you most likely
want to protect your drawings from unwanted eyes when sending drawing files via
e-mail or across the Internet. AutoCAD allows you to password-protect your drawings,
which forces anyone who wants to view the drawings to enter a password that you
supply. The Security Options dialog box (see Figure 2-1) allows you to assign a pass-
word or attach a digital signature to a drawing.
Figure 2-1:
You use the
Security
Options dia-
log box to
password-
protect and

a drawing.
32
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Exercise 2-9: Password-Protecting a Drawing File
Practice saving a drawing with a password.
1. Create a new drawing.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. In the Save Drawing As dialog box, choose Tools➪Security Options.
4. In the Security Options dialog box, click the Password tab.
5. In the Password or Phrase to Open This Drawing text box, enter protect30 or
another password of your choice.
6. Click Encrypt Drawing Properties to hide the custom properties of a drawing
when they’re viewed outside AutoCAD.
Encrypting the properties of a drawing is optional.
7. Click Advanced Options to specify an encryption provider and key length. Select
RC4, Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider from the list of choices in the
Choose an Encryption Provider list box.
The encryption provider and key length can vary from computer to computer
and country to country, and changing the values is optional. 
8. Select 128 from the Choose a Key Length drop-down list and click OK.
9. In the Security Options dialog box, click OK.
10. In the Confirm Password dialog box, enter the password that you entered in Step
5 in the text box and click OK.
11. Finish saving the drawing with the name ProtectedDWG. Save it to the Chapter 2
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
12. Close the drawing.
When saving a drawing with a password, be sure to write down the password
that you use in a safe spot because there is no way to obtain the password if you
lose it. You might also want to save the drawing with a password to a different
location so you still have the original drawing file just in case you forget the
password. 
Exercise 2-10: Opening a Drawing File That Is Protected by a Password
For this exercise, open the drawing ProtectedDWG.dwg that you created in Exercise 2-9
or the drawing file Exercise2-10.dwg from the Chapter 2 folder in the My Practice
Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice opening a drawing that has been previ-
ously password-protected.
1. In the Password dialog box, enter the password protect30 or the one that you
chose to use when saving the drawing.
2. Click OK to open the drawing.
If you reference or insert a drawing that’s protected by a password, you also
need to enter the password when performing these tasks as well. After you open,
attach, or insert a drawing with a password, you don’t need to re-enter the pass-
word until you close and restart AutoCAD because it gets cached for the current
session.
3. Close the drawing without saving changes.
33
Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files

Attaching a digital signature
Digital signatures allow you to protect drawing files without restricting access to them
like password protection does. When you digitally sign a drawing file, you are putting a
stamp on the file that tells the next person that opens the drawing that it hasn’t been
altered since the last time it was saved. Unlike password-protecting a drawing (which
is built into AutoCAD), you must obtain a digital signature from a provider such as
VeriSign (www.verisign.com) or IdenTrust (www.identrust.com) before you can
digitally sign a drawing.
VeriSign is the preferred choice of Autodesk because when no digital signature is found
on your machine, you’re sent to the Web site for VeriSign. After you obtain a digital
signature, you use the Digital Signature tab of the Security Options dialog box (see
Figure 2-2). If you save a drawing that’s digitally signed on a different computer from
the one you originally used to sign the drawing, the digital signature becomes invalid
unless you resign the drawing. 
Exercise 2-11: Obtaining a Digital Signature
Practice obtaining a trial digital signature from VeriSign.
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the Open and Save tab.
3. Click the Security Options button.
4. In the Security Options dialog box, click the Digital Signature tab.
5. In the Valid Digital ID Not Available dialog box, click Get a Digital ID.
The Products & Services page on VeriSign.com is displayed (www.verisign.com/
products-services). If the Valid Digital ID Not Available dialog box isn’t dis-
played, you most likely already have a valid digital signature present on your
machine.
6. On the Products & Services page, click the Managed PKI Services link.
Figure 2-2:

2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. In the Save Drawing As dialog box, choose Tools➪Security Options.
4. In the Security Options dialog box, click the Digital Signature tab.
5. Click the Attach Digital Signature After Saving Drawing check box.
If the Valid Digital ID Not Available dialog box is displayed, you need to obtain
and install a digital signature from VeriSign (refer to Exercise 2-11).
6. Select the digital signature you want to attach to the current drawing.
7. Select National Institute of Standards and Technology from the Get Time Stamp
From drop-down list.
Specifying a computer or server from which to obtain the time stamp is optional.
8. Enter Drawing ready for approval. in the Comment text box.
Specifying a comment when digitally signing a drawing is optional.
9. Click OK.
10. Finish saving the drawing with the name SignedDWG. Save it to the Chapter 2
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
11. If the Signing Data with Your Private Exchange Key dialog box is displayed, click OK.
12. Close the drawing.
If you have a number of drawings that need to be digitally signed, you can use the
Attach Digital Signatures utility that comes with AutoCAD. The only difference
between attaching a digital signature in AutoCAD or using the Attach Digital
Signatures is that you need to specify which drawings you want to digitally sign;
otherwise, the process is the same. To launch the Attach Digital Signatures utility,
choose Start➪[All] Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2008➪Attach Digital Signatures.

Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files

Exercise 2-13: Opening a Drawing with a Digital Signature
For this exercise, open the drawing SignedDWG.dwg that you created in Exercise 2-12
or open the drawing file Exercise2-13.dwg from the Chapter 2 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice opening a drawing that has
been previously digitally signed.
1. In the Digital Signature Contents dialog box, review the digital signature to make
sure that the digital signature is valid.
The Digital Signature Contents dialog box open automatically when you open a
drawing with a digital signature. If it doesn’t, enter sigvalidate at the command
prompt and press Enter to display the Validate Digital Signature dialog box. In
the Validate Digital Signature dialog box, click the View Base Signature button to
display the Digital Signature Contents dialog box.
2. Click Close.
When a drawing has a digital signature attached to it, the Validate Digital
Signature icon is displayed in the status bar tray.
3. Close the drawing without saving changes.
If you make changes to a drawing file that has a digital signature attached to it,
the digital signature becomes invalid unless you resign the drawing.
Closing Drawings
After you save a drawing or if you don’t want to save any of the changes you made,
you can close the drawing file. AutoCAD allows you to close one drawing at a time or
all the open drawings. When closing a drawing, AutoCAD checks to see whether the
drawing has been saved, and if it hasn’t, you’re prompted to save or discard the
changes or to cancel the closing of the drawing altogether.
You can close the open drawing in the following ways:
 Choose File➪Close and save the drawing if prompted.
 Choose Window➪Close and save the drawing if prompted.
 Enter close at the command prompt and save the drawing if prompted.
 Click the X on the drawing window.

Practice closing all the open drawing files.
1. Create a new drawing and open a few of the drawings from the Chapter 2 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
2. Choose Window➪Close All.
3. If an AutoCAD message box appears, asking you to save the changes, click No
to discard the changes. If you want to save the changes, click Yes or click Cancel
to keep the drawing open and terminate the closing of all the remaining open
drawings.
4. Continue to click Yes or No when prompted to save changes for each drawing
until all drawing files have been closed.
If you’re done with AutoCAD for the day, you can close the application window.
You’re prompted to save any changes that you made to any of the drawings that
are currently open before AutoCAD closes.
Archiving and Backing Up Drawings
You spend a lot of time working on your drawings, so you should make sure to protect
them from hardware failures through archives and backups. You shouldn’t store draw-
ing files locally on your computer, but on a network where your files can be backed up
periodically and accessed by other members of the design team. If you don’t have a
network available to you, use a drive that can read/write to a removable media such as
a DVD/CD or removable hard drive. Before you decide to create your own backups,
check with your IT department or the CAD manager/lead drafter to see whether you
need to follow an established backup process.
Archiving a drawing is a little more involved than just backing up a drawing file.
Archiving a drawing file is like taking a snapshot in time of the drawing and all the
files that the drawing relies on to be displayed and plotted correctly. AutoCAD offers
two commands that allow you to archive drawings and all of its associated files. The
ETRANSMIT command displays the Create Transmittal dialog box (see Figure 2-3),
which allows you to create a transmittal package for a drawing with all of its associ-
ated files into an archive (ZIP or EXE) file or a folder. The other command that
AutoCAD offers to archive a drawing is called ARCHIVE, which is useful if you’re
archiving sheet sets instead of individual drawings.

Recovering a Drawing
Computers are more and more like people each day, which is kind of scary. In this day
and age, computers find themselves catching colds and overexerting themselves too
much at times, which leads to something breaking or even worse — a system failure.
Just like you take care of yourself by eating right, taking vitamins, and exercising, you
should make sure to use virus scan software on your computer and network, and per-
form routine maintenance to keep them running smoothly. No matter how well you
take care of yourself and your computers, something is bound to happen once in a
while that is out of your control.
From time to time, you’ll encounter a bad drawing file. Bad drawing files occur due to
an internal problem in AutoCAD or a bad third-party application (an application that
writes to the drawing [DWG] file format that isn’t created by Autodesk), or a system
crash occurs when AutoCAD is attempting to write to a drawing file. In these situa-
tions, AutoCAD provides some utilities that help you recover and audit drawing files
that go bad. To recover a drawing file that you can’t open in AutoCAD, you can use the
RECOVER command. If a drawing has some issues but you can open it, you can use
the AUDIT command.
If AutoCAD crashes with a drawing file open that you haven’t saved yet, you’re prompted
to save the file with _recover appended to the end of the drawing’s name. After restart-
ing AutoCAD, the Drawing Recovery Manager palette (see Figure 2-4) displays, which
allows you to open the drawing file that was open before the crash, the most recent
backup drawing (BAK), automatic save (SV$) files, and the drawing that AutoCAD saved
for you before it was completely closed. The Drawing Recovery Manager palette displays
information about the files that can be recovered and a preview of the last saved view in
the file.

Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files

Exercise 2-17: Recovering a Drawing
In this exercise, you use the drawing file Exercise2-17.dwg from the Chapter 2
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice recovering
the drawing file.
1. Choose File➪Drawing Utilities➪Recover.
2. In the Select File dialog box, browse to and select the Exercise2-17.dwg.
Click Open.
The drawing file is opened in memory, and AutoCAD performs an audit on it before
loading it into a drawing window. The results of the audit are displayed in the Text
Window. The following is an example of the results an audit performed on a draw-
ing file:

Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Exercise 2-19: Using the Recovery Manager
Open the drawing file Exercise2-19.dwg from the Chapter 2 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice using the Recovery Manager
to open a drawing file after AutoCAD crashes.
1. Save the drawing and check the Chapter 2 folder. A backup drawing file is now
created for the drawing 
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
3. In the Options dialog box, click the Open and Save tab.
4. Under the File Safety Precautions section, change the current value for Minutes
Between Saves to 1.
Take note of the current value so you can change it back later; the default value
is 10.
5. Click OK.
6. Choose Draw➪Point➪Single Point and click anywhere in the drawing.
No need to worry about what the Point command does, but just in case you do
want to know it creates a point object at the point you picked. The AutoSave fea-
ture only begins after a change has occurred in a drawing; saving a drawing
results in the AutoSave feature being temporarily disabled. Wait a minute until a
message similar to Automatic save to C:\DOCUME~1\Lee\LOCALS~1\Temp\
Exercise2-19_1_1_6970.sv$ is displayed in the Command Line window.
When you have a drawing, a backup drawing, and an automatic save file to work
with, you have to make AutoCAD think it’s crashing so you can see how the
Recovery Manager works.
7. Right-click an empty area of the Windows taskbar and choose Task Manager.
Or choose Start (Windows)➪Run. In the Run dialog box, enter taskmgr in the
Open text box and click OK.
8. In the Windows Task Manager, click the AutoCAD 2008 entry on the
Applications tab.
9. Click the End Task button.
10. Wait until the End Program dialog box displays and click the End Now button.
Although not the best way to close AutoCAD or any other application for that
matter, it’s an effective way to see how the Drawing Recovery Manager works.
11. If you’re prompted to save the recent changes, click OK.
The changes aren’t saved to the original file; instead, they’re saved to a drawing
file of the same name as the drawing file that was open during the crash, but
with _recover appended to the end of the filename.
12. Restart AutoCAD.
13. In the Drawing Recovery dialog box, click OK.
The Drawing Recovery dialog box is letting you know that something caused
AutoCAD to close unexpectedly.
14. On the Drawing Recovery Manager palette, click the plus sign next to the
Exercise2-19 folder in the Backup Files section.
41
Chapter 2: Working with Drawing Files

All the files that contain the most recent changes of the drawing that was open
during the crash are displayed in this folder. The original Exercise2-19.dwg
drawing is listed, along with an automatic save file and the most recent
backup drawing file. If AutoCAD allowed you to save the drawing during the
crash, you have a drawing file with the name Exercise2-19_recover.dwg
in the list as well.
15. Click each drawing file to display a preview and details about the file.
16. Double-click the file Exercise2-19.bak to open the backup drawing file.
17. Save the drawing file with the name Exercise2-19b.
Choose File➪Save As to save the current drawing file with a different name.
18. Right-click the Exercise2-19 folder in the Drawing Recovery Manager and select
Remove.
If you save one of the files that you open from the Drawing Recovery Manager
with the same name as the original drawing file, the other files are automatically
removed along with the folder used to organize the files.
Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. To specify a default drawing template when creating a new drawing, enter qnew at the com-
mand prompt to use the QUICK NEW command.
You specify the path and filename for the drawing template to be used by choosing Template
Settings➪Default Template File Name for Qnew. The Options dialog box appears, and you can
specify the path and filename on the Files tab.
2. Besides choosing File➪Open, how else can you open an existing drawing? 
B, C, and D. You can open a drawing by selecting a file from the bottom of the File menu, click-
ing Open on the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl+O.
3. Name three ways to save a drawing with a different name. 
Do any of the following and then enter a name and path:
• Choose File➪Save As.
• Enter saveas at the command prompt.
• Press Ctrl+Shift+S.
4. How do you close all the open windows at once? 
A, C, D, E. You can close all open drawings by choosing File➪Exit or Window➪Close All, enter-
ing closeall at the command prompt, or clicking the Close button on each application window.
You’re prompted to save any drawings you haven’t saved.

Customizing Your Work Environment
In This Chapter

 Customizing the user interface
A
utoCAD offers a number of ways to make sure that the drawings you create are consis-
tent with each other and allow you to access the right tools quickly when you need
them. Some of the most basic ways of customizing AutoCAD and the user interface are the
most effective in helping you to save time when creating and modifying drawings. The exer-
cises in this chapter give you an understanding of how to do some basic customization to
the drawing environment in AutoCAD and the user interface.
Setting Up Drafting Options
AutoCAD uses a number of different options to control the behavior of the way objects are
created and modified, how its application window looks, and even where it looks for files that
are specific to some features. You can find most — but not all — of the options that AutoCAD
uses in the Options dialog box (see Figure 3-1). 
Figure 3-1:
The Options
dialog box.

You can open the Options dialog box with any of the following methods:
 Choose Tools➪Options.
 Right-click the drawing window with no objects selected and choose Options.
 Right-click the Command Line window and choose Options.
 Enter options or op at the command prompt.
You can also access some settings when using a command such as FILLET and CHAMFER.

What is the Options dialog box used for?
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________
The Options dialog box is organized into ten tabs with options that are related to each
other on each tab. For example, all the options relating to selecting objects are on the
Selection tab, whereas the options related to working with objects in 3D are on the 3D
Modeling tab. Each tab has a theme, but not all the options that affect a specific drafting
task are located on just one tab. For example, when working with lights in your 3D
model, you have options on the Files tab for where the photometric Web files are stored
and more options on the Drafting tab for settings for the glyphs that control how lights
look. It’s really important to understand where the options are stored for the features
that you use on a regular basis because you might find it possible to set an option once
and then forget about it until you need to change it.
Table 3-1 lists the different tabs in the Options dialog box and the types of options on
each one.
Table 3-1
Tabs of the Options Dialog Box
Tab Name
Description
Files
Contains the locations in which specific files are stored that
AutoCAD uses for a number of different features. A number of file
and folder locations affect working with 3D features, such as the
location of texture maps and tool palettes.
Display
Contains settings that affect the way the application and the draw-
ing window look. Settings on this tab affect the way the drawing
window looks when working in a 2D or 3D view that uses either par-
allel or perspective projection.
Open and Save
Contains settings that affect opening and saving drawing files.
Plot and Publish
Contains settings that affect the way drawings are output to both
electronic files and hardcopy.
System
Contains settings that affect the performance of AutoCAD at the
application level. The main option on this tab that affects 3D is the
Performance Settings button (under the 3D Performance section),
which allows you to configure hardware acceleration.

Tab Name
Description
User Preferences
Contains settings that affect the way you interact with AutoCAD and
specific features.
Drafting
Contains settings that affect selecting points in the drawing window
and some settings that are related to working with 3D objects and
visualization.
3D Modeling
Contains settings that affect the creation of 3D objects and provide
input when working in the third dimension. 
Selection
Contains settings that affect selecting objects in the drawing window.
Profiles
Contains controls to allow you to create and manage user profiles.
The remainder of this section provides an overview of the settings in the Options
dialog box that affect 3D modeling in AutoCAD. To find out more about the settings in
the Options dialog box, click the Help button in the Options dialog box to open the
Online Help system or click the ? icon in the dialog box and click a control to display a
tooltip with a description of the tool.
Files tab
The Files tab contains a number of settings that are related to the locations of files that
AutoCAD uses, such as drawing templates, support files, and even the help files.
Usually you don’t need to change many of the default locations that AutoCAD uses, but
at times you need to know where some of the files that you use with 3D features are
stored so you can add more files to those locations.
Tool Palettes File Locations
The location(s) specified under Tool Palettes File Location affect the tool palettes that
are displayed on the Tool Palettes Window, which includes the tool palettes associated
with the Materials Library and other tool palettes that contain visual styles, materials,
and lights.
Texture Maps Search Path
Specifies where AutoCAD looks for image files that are used for materials.
Web File Search Path
Specifies where AutoCAD looks for photometric Web files used with Web lights.
Display tab
The Display tab contains a variety of settings that affect the way the application and
drawing windows look, along with how objects appear in the drawing. Features on this
tab affect both how the drawing window looks when working in a 3D projected view
and how some 3D helper objects look in the drawing window.
Colors
The Drawing Window Colors dialog box (see Figure 3-2) allows you to control the way
the drawing window looks when working in one of the different contexts that are in
AutoCAD. Two of the available contexts are used when the model in the drawing window
45
Chapter 3: Customizing Your Work Environment

is displayed in a parallel or perspective projected view. To display the Drawing Window
Colors dialog box, click the Colors button under the Window Elements section.
Rendered Object Smoothness
Specifies the smoothness of the curved surfaces of 3D objects when rendered or
shaded.
Contour Lines Per Surface
Specifies the number of contour lines per surface that affects both the performance of
a rendering and how long it takes to update the display of the drawing window.
Exercise 3-1: Changing the Display of Interface Elements 
For this exercise, open a drawing. Then practice changing the appearance of the light
glyphs in a drawing window for the 3D parallel projection context.

Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

System tab
The System tab contains an odd assortment of settings that help to address application
performance issues, from caching layout tabs to whether AutoCAD beeps if you input
an incorrect value. In the odds and ends settings of the System tab is a lone button that
allows you to configure hardware performance settings that AutoCAD uses. To access
the hardware performance settings for AutoCAD, click the Performance Settings button
under the 3D Performance section.
The display in AutoCAD is drawn one of two ways: by the software or hardware. I’m sure
you’re sitting there thinking, “Doesn’t the software tell the computer how to draw the
objects, and then doesn’t the hardware display it?” Although the software does tell the
hardware what to draw, when software acceleration is enabled, the CPU (central pro-
cessing unit) is given the task of doing all the calculations to generate the image that’s
displayed on-screen. Hardware acceleration, on the other hand, shifts most calculations
to the GPU (graphics processing unit) on the graphics card, and then an image is dis-
played on-screen.
Depending on the age of your computer’s graphic card, it might not be certified for use
with AutoCAD. Having a certified graphics card indicates that Autodesk has tested the
card with AutoCAD, and you shouldn’t have any types of display problems when using
hardware acceleration. However, lacking a certified graphics card doesn’t mean you
can’t run AutoCAD on your system; you just might encounter some issues with the dis-
play not refreshing properly at times, or at worst, a system crash might occur. If you’re
running a graphics card that isn’t certified, you can check Autodesk’s Web site
(www.autodesk.com/autocad-graphicscard) to see whether your graphics card
has a newer driver that you can download and run so you can use all the features that
your graphics card supports or whether you need to enable software acceleration.
The first time you start AutoCAD, it checks your graphics card against the database of
graphics cards that were tested when it shipped. After the initial setup, you can use the
Adaptive Degradation and Performance Tuning dialog box (see Figure 3-3) to change
between software and hardware acceleration. Then you can specify which features of
hardware acceleration to use from the Manual Performance Tuning dialog box (see
Figure 3-4). Along with enabling and disabling hardware acceleration from the Adaptive
Degradation and Performance Tuning dialog box, you can get information about your
graphics card and change the settings of which effects shouldn’t be degraded when your
hardware can’t support them as AutoCAD attempts to update the display in real time.
Figure 3-3:

Adaptive
Degradation
and

Chapter 3: Customizing Your Work Environment

Exercise 3-2: Enabling Hardware Acceleration and Adjusting Adaptive
Degradation
For this exercise, open a drawing. Then practice enabling hardware acceleration and
changing the behavior that AutoCAD uses to degrade the effects that it supports when
viewing a drawing in a shaded view in real time.
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. In the Options dialog box, click the System tab.
3. On the System tab, click Performance Settings.
4. In the Adaptive Degradation and Performance Tuning dialog box, click Manual
Tune to open the Manual Performance Tuning dialog box.
5. If the Enable Hardware Acceleration option is deselected, select it.
The Driver Name and Effects area becomes enabled. If an effect is unsupported, a
red caution icon appears to the left of the effect’s name, but if the effect has some
sort of limitation, a yellow caution icon is displayed instead. When the feature is
fully supported and there were no issues found during the certification of the
driver by Autodesk, a green check mark is displayed next to the effect’s name.
6. From the Driver Name drop-down list, select OpenGL. (If your hardware doesn’t
support it, select Direct 3D.)
Figure 3-4:
The Manual
Performance
Tuning
dialog box.
48
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Some graphics cards support custom drivers from the vendor, so you might want
to check whether the manufacturer of your graphics card offers such a driver. A
custom driver can make better use of the specific hardware capabilities of the
hardware on your system, essentially getting more for what you paid for.
7. In the Hardware Effects list, select Full Shadow Display and then select ON from
the drop-down list that’s displayed.
Not all graphics cards support Full Shadow Display, but it’s nice if you can enable
the feature so you can see shadows in real time in the drawing window when
user-defined lights are in use.
8. Click OK to return to the Adaptive Degradation and Performance Tuning
dialog box.
9. In the Adaptive Degradation and Performance Tuning dialog box, make sure
Adaptive Degradation is selected.
The Adaptive Degradation option is used when using commands such as
3DZOOM and 3DORBIT in a shaded viewport. As you zoom, pan, or orbit in a
viewport, AutoCAD attempts to keep up with refreshing the screen as you
change the view, but based on your hardware, it might not be able to keep the
display clean-looking with all the effects that it supports. So as you change the
view, the options in the Degradation Order list control the order in which effects
should not be used if performance drops too much.
10. In the Degradation Order list, deselect Intersection Edges and Wireframe Display.
By deselecting the options, AutoCAD won’t degrade the effects no matter how
slow the display gets.
11. Select Textures from the Degradation Order list and move it above Ground
Shadows by clicking the Move Up button as many times as it takes.
Textures now are degraded much earlier than they originally were. The order of
the effects is personal; AutoCAD doesn’t care which one it stops using first —
AutoCAD just wants to go fast. 
12. Click OK twice to save the changes you made.
Drafting tab
The Drafting tab contains a number of settings that affect how you select points in the
drawing window, how dynamic tooltips are used, and the appearance of the glyphs for
lights and cameras.
Replace Z Value with Current Elevation
Controls whether the current value of the ELEVATION system variable is substituted
for the Z value of the coordinate that you pick in the drawing window when using
object snaps.
Ignore Negative Z Object Snaps for Dynamic UCS
Controls whether negative Z values are ignored when using Dynamic UCS with object
snaps.
49
Chapter 3: Customizing Your Work Environment

Lights Glyph Settings
Displays the Light Glyph Appearance dialog box, which allows you to control the 
size and color used to display light glyphs in the drawing window. To display the 
Light Glyph Appearance dialog box, click the Lights Glyph Settings button on the
Drafting tab.
Camera Glyph Settings
Displays the Camera Glyph Appearance dialog box, which allows you to control the
size and color used to display camera glyphs in the drawing window. To display the
Camera Glyph Appearance dialog box, click the Cameras Glyph Settings button on the
Drafting tab.
3D Modeling tab
The 3D Modeling tab (see Figure 3-5) controls a lot of different settings used for creating
and viewing drawings with 3D objects in them. Some of the settings affect the way the
crosshairs are displayed in a 3D parallel or perspective projected view and how the UCS
and dynamic input behave when working with 3D objects. Some settings also control 3D
viewing commands such as 3DWALK and 3DFLY.
3D Crosshairs
The 3D Crosshairs section contains various settings that control how the crosshairs
appear when working in a 3D projected view of the model.
Display UCS Icon
The Display UCS Icon section contains settings that control in which context the UCS
icon is displayed for both 2D and 3D.
Figure 3-5:
The 3D
Modeling
tab contains
a number of
settings that

50
Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

Dynamic Input
The Dynamic Input section contains an option that controls whether a field for Z coor-
dinates is displayed when prompted for coordinate input or feedback of the current
position of the crosshairs in the drawing when no command is active.
3D Objects
The 3D Objects section contains settings that affect the drawing window when creating
3D objects and how the final object look when created.
3D Navigation
The 3D Navigation section contains settings that affect the behavior of the scroll wheel
on an IntelliMouse and how the 3DWALK and 3DFLY commands behave when used.
Profiles tab
The Profiles tab allows you to create and manage user profiles. A user profile is a way
to group and organize settings based on the type of task that you’re doing or even 
project-based settings. Sometimes you want the display and settings to be a specific
way when working on 2D models and then another way when working on 3D models.
Profiles allow you to do just that without manually switching settings. Any setting in
the Options dialog box without a drawing icon next to it is stored in the user profile.
You can export and re-import user profiles as a way to back up your custom settings,
and you can quickly configure other machines using the exported user profile. User
profiles are exported to a file with the extension ARG.

Using Workspaces
Workspaces are a relatively new concept in AutoCAD and were once part of the user
profile. Workspaces control the display of user interface elements like toolbars, menus,
and dockable windows (palettes) in AutoCAD; they control where a user interface ele-
ment is positioned on screen and which ones are shown or hidden. Workspaces are
stored in the current customization file of AutoCAD, which is named acad.cui and is
located in the folder C:\Documents and Settings\user name\Application
Data\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2008\R17.1\enu\Support.
AutoCAD comes with three different workspaces that are each oriented towards differ-
ent tasks. The following table shows which workspaces come with AutoCAD, along with
a brief description of what tasks each workspace is targeted at.
Workspace Name
Description
3D Modeling
Displays the most commonly used interface elements that are
associated with creating and modifying 3D objects.
AutoCAD Classic
Displays the most commonly used interface elements that are
associated with 2D drafting and other general tasks in
AutoCAD. Mainly it’s all the same user interface elements that
were displayed by default with AutoCAD 2005 and earlier.
2D Drafting & 
Displays a subset of the available user interface elements that 
Annotation
AutoCAD offers that are used for 2D drafting and working with
annotation objects. The difference between this workspace
and the AutoCAD Classic is that this one displays the
Dashboard and many of the 2D-drafting-oriented panels,
instead of toolbars like the AutoCAD Classic workspace does.
After you have created your own workspaces or you want to use one that comes with
AutoCAD, you must set it current in order to restore the settings that are saved with
the workspace. Here’s how you can choose a workspace
 Choose Tools➪Workspaces and select a workspace to set it current.
 Select a workspace from the Workspaces drop-down list on the Workspaces
toolbar.
53

Figure 3-6). The Workspace Settings dialog box allows you to insert and remove separa-
tors that organize groups of workspaces. Along with organizing workspaces, you can con-
trol which workspaces you want to display and in which order they are displayed.

Exercise 3-7: Organizing Your Workspaces
Practice adding separators to the workspaces list to organize workspaces in groups,
reposition workspaces, and control which workspaces are displayed on the Tools
menu or in the Workspaces drop-down list on the Workspaces toolbar. You can also
enable the automatic saving option to force the saving of a workspace when switching
between different workspaces and set the default workspace for the My Workspace
feature. Before you start this exercise, be sure that you have completed Exercise 3-6.

Chapter 3: Customizing Your Work Environment

Customizing AutoCAD and Its User Interface
In AutoCAD, you can customize the user interface by creating new commands and plac-
ing them on toolbars, which gives you quick access to repetitive tasks. One of the most
popular ways of customizing AutoCAD is to create a custom toolbar that contains many
of the standard buttons from other toolbars that you use. To create a custom toolbar or
to create a new command to place on an existing toolbar, you use the Customize User
Interface editor (see Figure 3-7). This editor not only allows you to create toolbars and
custom commands, but it lets you modify the actions that happen when you double-
click objects in the drawing window, the context-sensitive menus that display when you
right-click in the drawing window, and many other user interface elements.
Customizing the user interface
The Customize User Interface editor allows you to take control of the user interface and
really customize it to the way you want to work. The user interface elements that are
displayed in AutoCAD (such as toolbars, menus, and even the behavior of things like
shortcut key combinations and double-click actions) are defined as part of a customiza-
tion (CUI) file. AutoCAD allows you to load multiple different customization files at a
time to load the tools that you need to get your work done as efficiently as possible.
The Customize User Interface editor is used for two different tasks: to customize the
user interface and to transfer customization to and from a customization file. In most
cases, you work on the Customize tab, unless you’re migrating from an older release of
AutoCAD, in which case you might find yourself using the Transfer tab. The Customize
tab includes an area to add new user interface elements and other areas to create
custom commands and modify the properties of a command or user interface element.
Although this section covers only how to create a basic custom command and create a
new toolbar, you can find more about customizing AutoCAD in the Customization Guide
of the Online Help system. To access the information on customizing the interface,
Figure 3-7:

Part I: Introducing AutoCAD 

choose Tools➪Customize➪Interface and click the Help button when the Customize
User Interface editor is displayed.
Exercise 3-8: Creating a Custom Command
Practice creating a custom command that draws a red 5 x 5 rectangle.
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Interface.
2. Click the Customize tab and click Create a New Command under the Command
List pane.
3. Click the Name field under the Properties pane and enter My Rectangle.
4. In the Description field, enter Creates a Red 5x5 Rectangle.
5. In the Macro field, enter the following:
^C^C._rectang;\@5,5;._change;_l;;_p;_c;1;;
6. Click OK to save the command to the CUI file and close the Customize User
Interface editor.
Exercise 3-9: Creating a Custom Toolbar
Practice creating a custom toolbar and add a custom and standard command to it.
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Interface.
2. Click the Customize tab and right-click Toolbars in the Customizations In pane.
3. Click New Toolbar.
4. Click the Name field under the Properties pane and enter My Tools.
5. In the Description field, enter My Custom Tools.
6. In the Commands List pane, select Custom Commands from the Categories drop-
down list.
7. Select the My Rectangle command and drag it from the command list up to the
My Tools node under Toolbars in the Customizations In pane. Release the mouse
button when the cursor is over the node for the My Tools toolbar.
8. Scroll down in the Command List pane until you find Rectangle.
9. Add the Rectangle command to the My Tools toolbar.
10. Click OK to save the changes to the toolbar and the CUI file and then close the
Customize User Interface editor.
The new toolbar My Tools floats on-screen near the upper-left corner of AutoCAD.
Click the toolbar buttons to test them and pick as many points in the drawing that
you’re requested to select. The My Rectangle command prompts you for one
point, but the Rectangle command prompts you for two points.
Other methods of customizing AutoCAD
AutoCAD is one of the most widely used Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD) applications
for a couple different reasons. First, it was one of the most affordable CAD drafting
applications on a personal computer back in the early 1980s, when most drafting 
applications ran on mainframes that took up a lot of space. Second, AutoCAD was 
back then and still is today the world’s most customizable drafting application on the
57
Chapter 3: Customizing Your Work Environment

market. AutoCAD not only allows you to change the way tools are arranged on-screen,
but it allows you to actually create custom programs that can alter the workflow of
your projects. So you can adapt AutoCAD to your business instead of adapting your
business to work with AutoCAD.
By customizing AutoCAD, you can create your own commands that might insert or
populate information in your title blocks or change the appearance of lines in the
drawing through a custom linetype. The following list mentions many of the features
you can customize in AutoCAD:
 Drawing templates
 Blocks
 Tool palettes
 Custom menus
 Custom shapes
 Custom linetypes
 Custom hatch patterns
 Command aliases
 AutoLISP and Visual LISP
 Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications
 VB .NET or C#
 ObjectARX
To find out more about customizing AutoCAD, check out the Customization Guide in
the Online Help system by choosing Help➪Help and then clicking the Customization
Guide link. In addition to the Customization Guide, AutoCAD offers an Online Help file
called Developer Help, which covers many of the different programming options that
are available. Open the Developer Help file by choosing Help➪Additional Help➪
Developer Help.
Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. What is the Options dialog box used for?
You use the Options dialog box to define some of the general settings that are used globally in
AutoCAD, define how files are saved or plotted, and define settings that control the behavior of
selecting objects.
2. To migrate custom settings from a previous release of AutoCAD to AutoCAD 2008, choose
Start➪All Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2008➪Migrate Custom Settings.
3. Instead of choosing Tools➪Workspace➪Save Current, how else can you save a workspace?
B, C. Do one of the following and then enter a name for your workspace:
• Select the Save Current As option from the Workspaces drop-down list on the Workspaces
toolbar. 
• Enter workspace at the command prompt.

Part II
Going from 2D to 3D

In this part . . .
A
lthough some of the concepts that you already know
about 2D drafting have equivalent concepts when
talking about 3D modeling, a number of concepts are
unique to working in 3D. Before you start modeling, you
should know the differences between the three types of 3D
models that AutoCAD allows you to create: wireframe, sur-
face, and solid. As you start making the transition from
two dimensions to three dimensions, you find out how to
specify coordinate values using a Z-direction and how to
manipulate the user coordinate system to draw objects on
different planes.
2D drawings are primarily viewed using just pan and zoom
because they’re flat, but with 3D models, you have to navi-
gate around the model from all different angles and direc-
tions. You use visual styles when viewing a 3D model to
control how the edges and faces of the objects that make
up your model are displayed. After getting a good founda-
tion of inputting coordinates and navigating a 3D model,
you discover how to transition what you already know
about creating and modifying 2D objects to create and
modify 3D objects using 2D objects.

M
odeling in AutoCAD poses some interesting challenges if you’re completely new to
3D. The first thing that you need to understand is the different types of 3D models
that AutoCAD allows you to create. The second thing to know is which type of modeling
suits your needs. After understand the different modeling types available for creation, it’s
time to introduce working with the Z plane because 3D modeling introduces an additional
axis when entering coordinates that you most likely haven’t dealt with if you’ve created only
2D drawings in AutoCAD. When working with the Z axis, you have additional options for
entering coordinate values when creating and modifying objects. The exercises in this chap-
ter give you an understanding of how to enter coordinate values and work with the user
coordinate system (UCS) in AutoCAD when working with 3D models.
3D Modeling Types Available in AutoCAD
AutoCAD allows you to create three different types of 3D models: wireframe, surface, and
solid. Each model type has strengths and weaknesses. When you want to create a presenta-
tion drawing of some sort, surface and solid 3D models are what you need; to create a solid
or surface model, you can use a wireframe model as a template.
Wireframe model
Wireframe models are often referred to as 21⁄2D drawings because they aren’t 2D drawings in
the true sense; they’re created with 2D objects but in 3D space. Wireframe models aren’t true
3D models because they lack faces, which allow objects that are beyond to be hidden when a
3D visual style is applied or a rendering is done. You can think of a wireframe model as being
like a wire coat hanger or a chain link fence. Wireframe models are made up of standard 2D
objects that are given an additional coordinate value for the Z direction.
You can use most 2D objects when creating a wireframe model, but objects such as lines,
arcs, and circles are commonly used. The 2D objects are drawn in 3D using full X, Y, and Z
coordinate values rather than just X and Y coordinate values. Figure 4-1 shows a wireframe
model of a bracket that connects two parts together. The wireframe model is shown with the
3D Hidden visual style; all the individual 2D objects used to create the model are shown.

Surface model
Surface models are created from 3D objects called faces, which are true 3D objects in
the sense that they contain a surface that can hide objects beyond them when a 3D
visual style is applied or a rendering is done. Faces are created with three or four
sides. Although the surface of a face can hide objects that are beyond it in the current
view, they require some cleanup when shared edges are involved to provide a clean
look that makes individual surfaces seem like a much larger surface.
AutoCAD offers a number of commands that allow you to create individual faces or prim-
itive objects such as boxes, spheres, and cones. Figure 4-2 shows two surface models of
the same bracket; the left model doesn’t have any of its edges cleaned up, whereas the
right model has been cleaned up. The surface model is shown with the 3D Hidden visual
style, and the objects closest to you in the current view hide the objects beyond them
(unlike the wireframe model). Part IV covers surface models in greater depth.
Solid model
Solid models are created from 3D objects called solids, which are true 3D objects simi-
lar to faces that are used to make up surface models. 3D solids in AutoCAD are very
different from surface models; these objects aren’t flat surfaces. Also unlike surface
models, solid models don’t require additional cleanup of shared edges of the model
because a 3D solid object is one continuous object instead of being made up of many
different faces. 
AutoCAD offers a number of commands that allow you to create primitive objects such
as boxes, spheres, and cones along with editing the faces, edges, and bodies of a solid
in many different ways. Figure 4-3 shows a solid model of a bracket. The solid model is
shown with the 3D Hidden visual style, and the objects closest to you in the current
view hide the objects beyond them (like a surface model does). Part III of this book
covers solid models in greater depth.

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

Going Above the Plane
When creating 2D drawings, you create all objects on the working plane by using
absolute (X,Y), relative (@X,Y), and polar (@distance<angle) coordinate values. As you
create 3D models, you need to also supply an additional coordinate value along the Z
axis (which in most cases gives an object height). Like with 2D drafting, you can input
coordinate values by manually entering them at the command prompt, picking a point
using object snaps, or using polar or object snap tracking. As you create new objects
in a drawing, you can preset the height of the working plane so you don’t have to spec-
ify a Z coordinate value when the coordinates are on a specific plane.
Figure 4-3:
A solid
model of a
bracket.

Chapter 4: Transitioning from 2D to 3D
1.
How can you specify a coordinate value?
A.
Pick a point in the current viewport.
B.
Enter a coordinate value at the command prompt.
C.
Use Snap mode to pick a point on an object.
D.
Use direct distancing and enter a distance value to specify the next point.
Entering coordinate values at the 
command prompt
Understanding how to enter coordinate values when working in 3D can save you time
and help you produce accurate models. When creating 2D objects, you mainly use
three different coordinate values: absolute, relative, and polar. Polar coordinate entry
is different when working with 3D models because you have two different variations to
work with: spherical and cylindrical. 
Absolute coordinates (X,Y,Z)
Absolute coordinates in 3D are the same as absolute coordinates in 2D with the excep-
tion of adding a Z coordinate value. Absolute coordinate values are expressed in the
format X,Y,Z and are based on the current origin of the drawing. The following is an
example of drawing a line in 3D space using absolute coordinate entry:
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: 2.5,4,7.865

When prompted to specify a point, you can enter @ at the command prompt to use the
previous point specified in a drawing.
Relative coordinates (@X,Y,Z)
Relative coordinates in 3D are the same as relative coordinates in 2D with the excep-
tion of adding a Z coordinate value. Relative coordinate values are expressed in the
format @X,Y,Z and are based on the most recently entered coordinate value specified
in a drawing. The following is an example of drawing a line in 3D space using relative
coordinate entry:
Command: line
Specify first point: 1.25,5.675,2.15
Specify next point or [Undo]: @5,5,0.125 
Spherical coordinates (@distance<angle<anglefromXY)
The spherical coordinate format is the first of two possible coordinate entry formats
based on relative polar coordinate entry. Spherical coordinate values are expressed in
the format @distance<angle<anglefromXY. The following is an example of drawing a line
in 3D space using spherical coordinate entry. The results of entering a spherical coor-
dinate value to create a line are shown in Figure 4-4.
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: @4.125<30<45
Cylindrical coordinates (@XYdistance<angle,Z)
The cylindrical coordinate format is the second of two possible coordinate entry formats
based on relative polar coordinate entry. Cylindrical coordinate values are expressed in
the format @XYdistance<angle,Z. The following is an example of drawing a line in 3D
space using cylindrical coordinate entry. Figure 4-5 shows a line that was created by
entering a cylindrical coordinate value.
Command: line
Specify first point: 0,0,0
Specify next point or [Undo]: @4.125<60,0.675
When using Dynamic Input to enter coordinate values, avoid using the cylindrical
coordinate entry method because it doesn’t work very well. To disable Dynamic Input,
click the DYN button on the status bar or press F12.

Object snaps
Object snaps increase the accuracy of creating and modifying objects in 2D and 3D
drawings. For the most part, object snaps are the same in 3D as they are in 2D; you can
draw to the midpoint or from the endpoint of an object or use any of the other object
snaps to snap to points on objects. 3D object snaps differ from 2D in two ways:
 The Apparent Intersection object snap snaps to the point where two objects
intersect each other in the current view, but in all actuality they never intersect
each other.
 You can force objects to the current elevation even if you’re picking a snap on an
object with a different Z coordinate value. 
66
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 
2.
How do you set running object snaps?
A.
Hold down Shift, right-click, and choose the object snaps.
B.
Right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar, choose Settings, and then set the object
snaps you want to use.
C.
Choose Tools➪Drafting Settings, click the Object Snaps tab, and then set the object snaps
you want to use.
D.
At the command prompt, enter dsettings and press Enter. In the Drafting Settings dialog box,
click the Object Snaps tab and then set the object snaps you want to use.
The current running object snaps are set on the Object Snap tab in the Drafting
Settings dialog box, and the option to replace the Z coordinate value with the current
elevation is located on the Drafting tab of the Options dialog box. (Changing the cur-
rent elevation is covered in the section “Elevating [not levitating] objects,” later in this
chapter.) Along with the Replace Z Value with Current Elevation option in the Options
dialog box, you can change the appearance of the AutoSnap markers that appear to
indicate which type of object snap will be used at the snap point when picked.
Exercise 4-2: Using Object Snaps in 3D Space 
For this exercise, open the drawing Exercise4-2.dwg from the Chapter 4 folder in the
My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice using absolute, relative, and
cylindrical coordinate entry methods to draw a wireframe of a wedge-shaped object.
1. On the status bar, right-click the OSNAP button and choose Settings.
2. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, click Clear All and then select the Quadrant
and Endpoint check boxes.
3. If the Object Snap On check box isn’t selected, select it to enable running object
snaps.
4. Click the Options button.
5. In the Options dialog box on the Drafting tab, deselect Replace Z Value with
Current Elevation.
6. Click OK to return to the Drafting Settings dialog box.
7. Click OK to return to the drawing window.

8. Choose Draw➪Line and pick the points indicated in Figure 4-6. Pick them in the
proper order and end the LINE command.
9. Choose Tools➪Options.
10. In the Options dialog box on the Drafting tab, select Replace Z Value with Current
Elevation.
11. Click OK to return to the drawing window.
12. Choose Modify➪Copy.
13. Select the circle that is to the left of the wireframe model and press Enter.
14. At the Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde] <Displacement>:
prompt, pick at the quadrant indicated on the circle by the arrow in Figure 4-6.
15. At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:
prompt, pick the end of the line indicated by the letter A in Figure 4-6 using the
endpoint object snap. Press Enter to end the command.
The circle is copied to the bottom of the line instead of at the end that you
selected with the endpoint object snap, and this is because the current elevation
of the drawing is 0 (zero).
16. Choose Tools➪Options and click the Drafting tab.
17. On the Drafting tab, deselect Replace Z Value with Current Elevation.
18. Choose Modify➪Move.
19. If the Selecting Subobjects on Solids dialog box is displayed, click Close.
20. Select the Circle that is to the left of the wireframe model and press Enter.
21. At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
prompt, pick at the quadrant indicated on the circle by the arrow in Figure 4-6
using the endpoint object snap.
22. At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:
prompt, pick the end of the line indicated by the letter A in Figure 4-6. Press Enter
to end the command.
The circle this time moves to the object snap point by letter A because the
current elevation is ignored for the point you picked.
23. Save the drawing with the name Completed4-2.dwg to the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Chapter 4: Transitioning from 2D to 3D

Object snap tracking
Object snap tracking creates new objects that start at the intersection of two existing
points in the drawing or a point along a projected path from an acquired snap point.
You can use object snap tracking to track points that run along the XY plane or in the 
Z direction. If you use object snap tracking in the Z direction, you’re provided real-time
feedback of the current position along the projected path in a tooltip. 
The tooltip indicates whether you’re moving in a positive or negative direction from the
acquired snap point. To enable object snap tracking, right-click the OTRACK button on
the status bar and choose On or press the F11 key. Then, to acquire a point, hover the
cursor over a snap point for a moment. After you acquire a snap point, a temporary
marker is added to the drawing, and a vector is drawn orthogonally from the marker or
along a polar angle. To remove the marker for an acquired point, hover the cursor over
the snap point again, and the marker is removed. Figure 4-7 shows tracking a point
along a projected path in the Z direction with the tooltip displaying the current Z value
in the positive direction.
Exercise 4-3: Using Object Snap Tracking 
For this exercise, open the drawing Exercise4-3.dwg from the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice using object snap
tracking and object snaps to finish the back of the bracket.
1. On the status bar, right-click the OSNAP button and choose Settings.
2. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, click Clear All and then select the Endpoint
and Intersection check boxes.
3. If the Object Snap On check box isn’t selected, select it to enable running object
snaps.

9. At the Specify next point or [Undo]: prompt, hover the cursor over the
point indicated by the number 2 in Figure 4-8 but don’t click.
A marker is placed at the point, indicating that the point has been acquired for
object snap tracking.
10. Move the crosshairs to the point indicated by the number 3 in Figure 4-8. The
two vectors are projected where the starting point of the line and the acquired
point would intersect. Click in the drawing when the object snap tracking tooltip
displays the text Ortho: +Z, Endpoint: Z.
11. At the Specify next point or [Undo]: prompt, pick the endpoint indicated
by the number 4 in Figure 4-8.
12. At the Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: prompt, pick the endpoint
indicated by the number 5 in Figure 4-8. Press Enter to end the command.
13. Start the LINE command again and draw a line between the corners indicated by
the points numbered 2 and 3.
14. Save the drawing with the name Completed4-3.dwg to the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Point filters
Point filters construct coordinate values based on existing points of 2D or 3D objects.
Point filters for the most part are obsolete with everything that can be done with
object snap tracking, but they can come in handy from time to time when you want to
specify a coordinate value that isn’t at the intersection of two snap points. Six point fil-
ters are available to you when specifying points, but three are for obtaining 2D points
(.X, .Y, and .Z) and three are for obtaining 3D points (.XY, .XZ, and .YZ). You can enter
point filters at the command prompt, where you’re prompted to specify a point, or you
can select them from the Object Snap shortcut menu or the Snap Overrides submenu.
The following is an example of specifying a coordinate value with a point filter:
Command: line
Specify first point: specify a point or enter a coordinate value
Specify next point or [Undo]: enter .XY and press ENTER
of specify a point or enter a coordinate value
(need Z): specify a point or enter a Z coordinate value

Chapter 4: Transitioning from 2D to 3D

Elevating (not levitating) objects
When working in 3D, the working plane by default is at the elevation of 0 (zero). So when
a specific Z coordinate value isn’t entered, the elevation value is substituted when you
manually enter a coordinate value or pick a point in the drawing without using object
snaps. When the object snap setting Replace Z Value with Current Elevation (located on
the Drafting tab of the Options dialog box) is enabled, points selected using object snaps
are forced to substitute the current elevation value for the selected Z coordinate value;
otherwise, if the option is disabled, no substitution occurs when picking a snap point.
To set the current elevation, you use the ELEV command.
Exercise 4-4: Changing the Current Elevation of a Drawing 
For this exercise, open the drawing Exercise4-4.dwg from the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice changing the current
elevation in the drawing and create a wireframe model of a cube.
1. Choose Draw➪Line.
2. At the Specify first point: prompt, enter 0,0 and press Enter.
3. At the Specify next point or [Undo]: prompt, enter 500,0 and press Enter.
4. At the Specify next point or [Undo]: prompt, enter 500,500 and press
Enter.
5. At the Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: prompt, enter 0,500 and
press Enter.
6. At the Specify next point or [Close/Undo]: prompt, enter c and press
Enter to close the object.
7. At the command prompt, enter elev and press Enter.
8. At the Specify new default elevation <0.0000>: prompt, enter 500 and
press Enter twice.
9. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 with the new elevation.
The lines being created are 500 units above the original lines that you drew in
Steps 2 through 6.
10. Use the LINE command and draw vertical lines in the Z direction that connect
the bottom of the cube to the top of the cube.
11. Save the drawing with the name Completed4-4.dwg to the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
If you need to work with many different elevations in a drawing, you might want to
create a named user coordinate system (UCS) so you can quickly switch between dif-
ferent elevations. The next section describes how to create a custom UCS.
Working with the Coordinate Systems
AutoCAD uses a coordinate system to determine where objects are created in a draw-
ing, but many users don’t know how to harness the full power of it. As you create 2D
drawings, for the most part the coordinate system is left untouched except maybe in
some cases where you might move the origin in a very large drawing to make entering
70
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

coordinate values easier. However, when working in 3D space the coordinate system
plays a much bigger part in how you create and modify objects.
You can manipulate the coordinate system in order to create objects going in different
directions or even to continue drawing objects on the face of an existing 3D object. As
an example, you can align the coordinate system with the face of a 3D object to create
a hole in the surface. With that technique, you don’t have to draw the object first on
the XY plane and then modify the object by rotating/moving/aligning it into its final
position.
Understanding the coordinate systems 
AutoCAD utilizes two different coordinate systems when creating and modify objects
in a drawing. These two coordinate systems are known as world and user.
World coordinate system (WCS)
The world coordinate system (WCS) is controlled by AutoCAD and is fixed, so you
can’t alter it like the user coordinate system. The WCS stores and defines all objects
that you create in a drawing. When working in a 2D drawing, you commonly work with
the WCS. The X axis of the WCS runs horizontally (left and right) across the drawing,
and the Y axis runs vertically (up and down) across the drawing. The positive X direc-
tion is defined to go to the right, and the positive Y direction goes up.
User coordinate system (UCS)
The user coordinate system (UCS) is controlled by you as the user. You can manipulate
the coordinate system, which allows you to easily create and modify objects. The cur-
rent UCS affects how coordinate values are entered, the orientation that objects are
created in, and how many of the drawing aids such as object snap tracking and the
grid work. You can change the UCS manually and dynamically as needed. When you
manually define the UCS, you can create it as a named UCS so you can use it again.

When do you use the WCS, and when do you use the UCS?

Getting your bearings from the UCS icon 
The UCS icon to a drafter is like a compass to a sailor; never start drawing without know-
ing which direction you’re heading in. As you work in a drawing, the UCS icon is there
to show you which direction the positive X, Y, and Z axes are going in and gives you a
heads-up about whether you’re on the Model tab or a paper space layout tab. As you
change tabs or view the drawing with a 2D or 3D visual style, AutoCAD displays a slightly
different-looking UCS icon to let you know that these conditions are current in the draw-
ing. The appearance of the UCS icon can be customized in many different ways, which I
cover later in this section.

UCS icon in Model space with 2D wireframe visual style
As you view a drawing in plan view (looking down at the XY plane), the UCS icon indi-
cates which direction the positive X and Y axes are going in. When viewing a drawing
in an isometric view, the UCS icon appears rotated, and it shows you which direction
the positive X, Y, and Z axes are going in. Figure 4-9 shows the UCS icon in three differ-
ent situations on the Model tab: straight on in plan view, rotated in an isometric view,
and when the current UCS doesn’t represent the WCS. If a box appears at the intersec-
tion of the two or three axes of the UCS icon, you’re looking at the drawing from the
WCS, and if no box is displayed, you aren’t viewing the drawing from the WCS. 
UCS icon in Model space with 3D wireframe visual style
As you view a drawing in plan view (looking down at the XY plane), the UCS icon indi-
cates which direction the positive X and Y axes are going in and the direction of the 
Z axis, which is coming towards you by default but could be also moving away from
you. When viewing a drawing in an isometric view, the UCS icon appears rotated on-
screen so you see which direction the positive X, Y, and Z axes are going in. Figure 4-10
shows the UCS icon in two different situations on the Model tab: straight on in plan
view and rotated in an isometric view.
UCS icon in paper space layout
If a paper space layout is active, the UCS icon is shown as a right triangle (with or with-
out a box), and it indicates which direction the positive X and Y axes are going in, or
else it looks like a broken pencil. Because a paper space layout represents a virtual
sheet of paper, the things that affect the appearance of the UCS icon on the Model tab
don’t completely apply to the UCS icon on a paper space layout. Visual styles can’t be
set on a paper space layout, nor can the view be displayed in isometric.
The only thing that affects the UCS icon is rotating the current UCS. Like in Model space
with the 2D wireframe visual style, a box on the UCS icon indicates that the UCS icon

represents the WCS. If no box shows on the icon, the WCS isn’t currently represented.
The UCS icon displayed on a paper space layout can also be displayed as a broken
pencil, which indicates that the UCS icon has been rotated so far that it can’t be cor-
rectly shown. Figure 4-11 shows the UCS icon in two different situations on a paper
space layout: straight on in plan view and rotated 90 degrees around the X axis.
Customizing the display of the UCS icon 
How you’re viewing the current drawing can affect the UCS icon, but you do have the
ability to control whether the UCS icon is displayed at all or whether it appears only
when you’re in a certain context. You can also control whether it’s always displayed in
the lower-left corner of a drawing window or whether it appears at the origin of a
drawing when the origin is in the current viewport.
The UCS icon is displayed in the lower-left corner of the drawing window when it can’t
be displayed at the origin of the drawing. The origin of the drawing is usually 0,0, but it
can be changed for the current UCS. Choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪On. The con-
text in which the UCS icon is displayed is controlled by the options under the section
Display UCS Icon on the 3D Modeling tab of the Options dialog box.

Besides choosing View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪On, how can you change where the UCS icon is
displayed?
A.
Right-click the drawing window and choose UCS Icon On from the shortcut menu.
B.
Choose or View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Origin.
C.
Enter uscicon at the command prompt and designate where the UCS icon is displayed in the
drawing window.
D.
Choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Enable or View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪@0,0.
Along with specifying when and where the UCS icon is displayed, you can control how
it looks when the 2D Wireframe visual style is applied to the current viewport. The UCS
Icon dialog box (see Figure 4-12) customizes the appearance of the UCS icon when the
2D Wireframe visual style is applied to the current viewport. You can specify whether
the UCS icon has a 2D or 3D look to it, its size relative to the height of the drawing
window, and its color when it’s on the Model or a layout tab. To display the UCS Icon
dialog box, choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Properties.

Exercise 4-5: Customizing the Display of the UCS Icon 
Practice customizing the display of the UCS icon with the UCS Icon and Options dialog
boxes.
1. Create a new drawing with the drawing template Acad.dwt.
2. If the UCS icon isn’t displayed, choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪On.
Take note of how the UCS icon looks; by default, it’s black.
3. Choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Origin to toggle the position of the UCS icon
so it’s displayed at 0,0 or in the lower-left corner of the current viewport.
4. Choose View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Properties.
5. In the UCS Icon dialog box, select 2 from the Line Width drop-down list.
6. Slide the slider in the UCS Icon Size section until the value 10 is displayed in the
text box or enter 10 in the text box.
7. Select Blue from the Model Space Icon Color drop-down list under the UCS Icon
Color section.
8. Click OK.
9. Choose Tools➪Options.
10. On the 3D Modeling tab, deselect Display in 3D Perspective Projection.
11. Click OK to exit the Options dialog box.
The UCS icon is now blue in color and the lines are much heavier, which makes it
stand out better.
12. Choose View➪Visual Styles➪3D Hidden.
The UCS icon now changes from a flat line drawn object to what looks more like
a 3D object with three different colors.
13. Right-click the drawing window and choose Zoom.
14. Right-click the drawing window again and choose Perspective.
15. Press Enter.
The UCS icon now disappears from the viewport because you deselected the
Display in 3D Perspective Projection option in Step 10.
16. Close the drawing and don’t save the changes.

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

Modifying the UCS 
Working on a 2D drawing is much simpler than working on a 3D model because you’re
working in a top-down view most of the time, so the origin and direction of the UCS are
always going in the same direction from drawing to drawing. As you start working with
3D drawings, you will need to draw an object on the face of another object. To move or
change the orientation of the UCS in the viewport, you use the UCS command. If you
need to refer to the same UCS a number of times, you can save a UCS with a name so
you can restore it later when working with the same objects or view. The UCS dialog
box (see Figure 4-13) allows you to manage the named UCSs in a drawing.
Exercise 4-6: Changing the UCS and Creating a Named UCS 
For this exercise, open the drawing Exercise4-6.dwg from the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice manipulating the UCS
by aligning the UCS with the face of an object and the current view. You also create a
named UCS and return to the WCS.
1. Choose Tools➪New UCS➪Face.
2. At the Select face of solid object: prompt, select the face indicated
by the arrow in Figure 4-14 to move the UCS and change its orientation to match
the face.

3. At the Enter an option [Next/Xflip/Yflip] <accept>: prompt, press
Enter to accept the change to the UCS.
4. Choose Tools➪Named UCS.
5. In the UCS dialog box, right-click Unnamed in the list of named UCSs and choose
Rename from the shortcut menu.
6. Enter Part Edge for the name of the named UCS.
7. Click OK to exit the UCS dialog box.
8. Choose Tools➪New UCS➪View.
The UCS remains in its previous location, and its orientation is updated to be
parallel to the screen.
9. Choose Tools➪Named UCS.
10. Select Part Edge from the named UCSs list and click Set Current.
11. Click OK to exit the UCS dialog box.
The UCS returns to the orientation saved with the named UCS Part Edge.
12. Choose Tools➪New UCS➪World.
The UCS icon returns to the origin and orientation of the WCS in the drawing.
13. Save the drawing with the name Completed4-6.dwg to the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Manipulating the UCS dynamically
Creating a new UCS each time you want to create a new object on an existing 3D object
can consume a lot of time switching between different UCSs, and for this reason,
AutoCAD comes with a feature called Dynamic UCS. Dynamic UCS allows you to create
a temporary UCS on the face of an object by simply positioning the crosshairs over the
face of the object and clicking. To enable/disable Dynamic UCS, you can click the DUCS
button on the status bar or press the F6 key. When Dynamic UCS is enabled and you’re
requested to specify a point, the face of the object that the crosshairs is over becomes
highlighted to indicate that if you click now, the UCS dynamically changes to align with
that face (see Figure 4-15).

ically on the

76
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

Exercise 4-7: Using Dynamic UCS 
For this exercise, open the drawing Exercise4-7.dwg from the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Practice creating an object on
the face of a 3D solid using Dynamic UCS.
1. On the status bar, right-click the DUCS button and choose On.
Take note of the current position and orientation of the UCS icon in the corner of
the face along the edge of the part.
2. Choose Draw➪Circle➪Center, Radius.
3. Position the crosshairs over the face indicated by the arrow in Figure 4-16.
The edges of the face become highlighted.
4. With the edges of the face highlighted, click near the middle of the face to spec-
ify the center point of the circle.
The UCS icon is positioned at the point picked, and its orientation is changed to
match the face of the 3D solid.
5. Enter a radius of 0.125 for the circle and press Enter.
The UCS icon returns to its previous location after the circle has been created.
6. Save the drawing with the name Completed4-7.dwg to the Chapter 4 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. How can you specify a coordinate value?
A, B, and D. You can specify coordinates in a number of ways, from manually entering values at
the command line to picking points in the drawing using object snaps or using snap mode to
specify points based on an incremental value. C is the incorrect answer because you use Snap
mode to select points in the drawing based on an incremented value or invisible grid, not by
picking points on an object.
2. How do you set running object snaps?
B, C, and D. Running object snaps are set by selecting the object snaps you want to use on the
Object Snaps tab in the Drafting Settings dialog box. A is the incorrect answer because you can
only specify an object snap override from the shortcut menu.

77
Chapter 4: Transitioning from 2D to 3D

3. When do you use the WCS, and when do you use the UCS?
You always use the WCS when possible, but there are many cases when you want to draw
objects on the surface of a 3D object, such as to create a hole or to add a new set of surfaces.
When you want to draw on the surface of an object, you want to define a new UCS.
4. Besides choosing View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪On, how can you change where the UCS icon is
displayed? 
B and C. You can display the UCS icon by choosing or View➪Display➪UCS Icon➪Origin, or
by using the UCSICON command. A is incorrect because no option is available from any short-
cut menu that allows you to control the display of the UCS icon. D is incorrect as well because
this menu choice doesn’t exist.

In This Chapter
 Working with orthogonal and isometric views
 Panning, zooming, and orbiting in a 3D model
 Using named views, cameras, and backgrounds
 Enhancing the view of the 3D model with visual styles
 Controlling the quality of a 3D model’s appearance
You can view a drawing in many different ways, but when you work in 2D, you’re essen-
tially limited to panning and zooming. While working in 3D, you have an additional axis
that you must contend with. AutoCAD allows you to view your 3D models using orthogonal
and isometric preset viewpoints, along with giving you the ability to adjust the view of a
3D model by panning, zooming, and orbiting (rotating/twisting a view). The exercises in
this chapter give you an understanding of how to navigate around a 3D model and use
some basic visualization methods.
When you’re navigating 3D models, most of the common tools that you need exist nicely in
one place. The 3D navigation tools that are introduced in this chapter are on the 3D Navigate
panel (see Figure 5-1) of the Dashboard panel.

Establishing the Point of View
As you start working in 3D, you need to change the way you look at your 3D model.
AutoCAD allows you to change the current viewpoint of a 3D model in a number of dif-
ferent ways. You can use preset viewpoints to make navigating your 3D models easier
when modeling or use a custom viewpoint when plotting.
Orthogonal viewpoints
AutoCAD comes with a number of orthogonal preset viewpoints that allow you to navi-
gate around a 3D model. There are a total of six preset orthogonal viewpoints, and
they are parallel to the current UCS (user coordinate system): Top, Bottom, Left, Right,
Front, and Back. You specify orthogonal viewpoints by doing any of the following:
 Choose View➪3D Views and select a viewpoint.
 Select a preset viewpoint from the Named Views drop-down list on the Views
toolbar or the 3D Navigate panel.
 Enter -view at the command prompt and select the Orthographic option.
Figure 5-2 shows a 3D model mounting flange from a Top and Left viewpoint.
Isometric viewpoints
AutoCAD comes with four preset isometric viewpoints that allow you to view a 3D
model parallel to the current UCS and from above: Southwest, Northwest, Northeast,
and Southeast. Isometric viewpoints allow you to view a model from above, and you
specify them the same way you do orthogonal viewpoints. If you want to view the
model from below in an isometric view, you use the Viewpoint Presets dialog box or
one of the 3D orbiting commands that I talk about later in this chapter. I cover the
Viewpoint Presets dialog box in the “Using the Viewpoint Presets dialog box” section
and the 3D orbiting commands in the “Orbiting” section. Figure 5-3 shows a 3D model
of a mounting flange from a Southwest viewpoint.

Exercise 5-1: Using Orthogonal and Isometric Preset Viewpoints
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-1.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice viewing the draw-
ing using some of the preset views.
1. Display the Dashboard.
Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Dashboard.
2. On the Dashboard, select Top from the Named Views drop-down list on the 
3D Navigate panel.
If the 3D Navigate panel isn’t displayed on the Dashboard, right-click one of the
displayed panels and choose Control Panels➪3D Navigate.
The drawing switches to the Top preset view.
3. From the Named Views drop-down list, select Bottom.
The drawing switches to the Bottom preset view.
4. From the Named Views drop-down list, select Southwest.
The drawing switches to the Southwest preset view, which allows you to look at
the drawing from above the part.
5. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
By default, AutoCAD uses smooth transitions to switch from one viewpoint to another,
which helps you keep your orientation in the drawing. You can control the speed —
frames per second — and which viewing functions use smooth transitioning with the
View Transitions dialog box. To display the View Transitions dialog box, enter vtop-
tions at the command prompt.
Using the Viewpoint Presets dialog box
Using orthogonal and isometric preset viewpoints is great to quickly navigate around
your 3D model, but sometimes you want to view your 3D model from a nonpreset view-
point, such as from the bottom of a 3D model at an isometric view. The Viewpoint Presets
dialog box (see Figure 5-4) allows you to view a 3D model from a specific angle along the 
X axis and from the XY plane. As you specify a viewpoint, you can specify the angles in
the world coordinate system (WCS) or in the current user coordinate system (UCS).

Exercise 5-2: Changing the Viewpoint with the Viewport Presets Dialog Box
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-2.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice changing the
viewpoint of a 3D model with the Viewpoint Presets dialog box.
1. Choose View➪3D Views➪Viewpoint Presets.
2. In the Viewpoint Presets dialog box, click 135° on the left side of the image to
specify the From X Axis value.
3. Click near 60° on the right side of the image to specify the From XY Plane value.
4. Click OK.
The viewpoint updates and shows a view that’s similar to a Northwest isometric
view, but using a greater angle to give the view a more top-down look at the model.
5. Display the Viewpoint Presets dialog box again; this time, enter the value 250 in
the From X Axis text box and -45 in the From XY Plane text box.
6. Click OK.
The viewpoint updates and shows an isometric view of the bottom of the
3D model.
7. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
Accessing the tripod and compass 
to find your way
AutoCAD is a very visual application, and at times you want to interact with the draw-
ing window directly to manipulate the current viewpoint instead of using one of the
preset views or the Viewpoint Presets dialog box. The VPOINT command allows you to
set the current viewpoint by interacting with what’s known as the tripod and compass
(see Figure 5-5). The tripod shows you the direction of the X, Y, and Z axes in the cur-
rent UCS based on the location specified by the compass. The compass is located in
the upper-right corner of the current viewport and is a 2D representation of a globe;
the center point is the top (north pole), the outer ring is the bottom (south pole), and
the inner ring is the equator. If you know the specific angle from the X axis and the
angle from the XY plane, you can use the Rotate option of the VPOINT command.
When working with 3D models, you spend a lot of time navigating. If you find yourself
using a number of custom viewpoints, you might want to create a custom toolbar with
buttons to set the current viewpoint for you.

Standard Viewing Mechanics
If you’ve done a fair amount of 2D drafting, you most likely are familiar with two of the
main ways to get around and up close to your designs: panning and zooming. Along
with panning and zooming in a 3D model, you can also adjust the distance from an
object, and you can even swivel the current view as if you’re standing in one spot and
turning around that point, walking through or around a 3D model, or putting on a cape
and flying through or around a 3D model.
Zooming and panning
Panning and zooming in 3D are no different than they are in 2D with the exception that
instead of using the PAN command you use 3DPAN, and you use 3DZOOM instead of
ZOOM. Although it might seem somewhat confusing that AutoCAD uses different com-
mands, you really don’t have to worry too much about it because AutoCAD simplifies
everything by using the 3D commands when a 3D visual style is active. I talk about
visual styles later in this chapter, in the “Giving Your 3D Models Style (Fashion Tips
Not Included)” section.
Table 5-1 lists the basic 3D navigation commands that you can use to navigate a 3D
model.
Table 5-1
Basic 3D Navigation Commands
Button
Navigation Method 
Description
(Command Name)
Pan (3DPAN)
Allows you to interactively drag the current
view in any direction parallel to the screen to
see other parts of your 3D model without
changing the current zoom magnification.
Zoom (3DZOOM)
Allows you to interactively drag the current
view to increase or decrease the magnifica-
tion of the camera, making objects appear
larger or smaller.

When the Pan or Zoom commands are active, you can access a number of 3D navigation
options via the right-click menu. You can access other 3D navigation commands like
Constrained Orbit and Swivel along with switching between parallel and perspective pro-
jection, among other options.
If you have an IntelliMouse or a mouse that has three buttons, you can perform these
actions:
 Pan in the current viewport: Press and hold down the scroll wheel or the
middle mouse button. To use the scroll wheel or middle button to pan, set the
system variable MBUTTONPAN to 1 and be sure the mouse is properly config-
ured. While holding down the scroll wheel or middle button, you can initiate
orthogonally panning by holding the Shift key.
 A zoom extents in the current viewpoint: Double-click with the scroll wheel or
the middle button. 
 Zoom in and out in real time: Scroll the wheel forward and backward. The
system variable ZOOMFACTOR controls the magnification percentage the draw-
ing is zoomed in or out when scrolling the wheel on the mouse. The system vari-
able ZOOMWHEEL controls in which direction the mouse wheel is scrolled to
zoom in or out. 
When a 3D navigate command is active like 3DPAN and 3DZOOM, switch between dif-
ferent 3D navigation commands by pressing the numeric key next to one of the options
under the Other Navigation Modes submenu on the right-click menu.
Exercise 5-4: Navigating a 3D Model Using the Basics
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-4.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice using some of
the basic 3D navigation commands and some of the options from the right-click menu
when a 3D navigation command is active.
1. On the Dashboard, select Zoom from the 3D Navigate panel.
2. Click in the drawing window, and drag up and drag down.
Dragging up zooms in, and dragging down zooms out so you can see more of the
drawing. 
If you’re using Windows XP, you can drag past the edge of the drawing window to
keep zooming in or out if you need to.
3. With Zoom still as the active 3D navigation mode, press 9 on the keyboard to
switch to panning.
4. Click in the drawing window and drag in any direction to pan the drawing.
5. Right-click the drawing window and choose Reset View.
The view is reset to the initial view that was set before you started zooming and
panning in the drawing. 
6. Right-click the drawing window and choose Zoom Extents.
The view is changed to show the extents of the model.
7. Press Esc or Enter to exit the current 3D navigation command.
8. Close the drawing without saving the changes.

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

Orbiting
Outside of changing the viewpoint using one of the presets, panning, or zooming in on
a 3D model, you can rotate your model interactively on-screen. The proper terminol-
ogy of rotating a 3D model is orbiting. Orbiting a 3D model is very similar to the way
the moon orbits around the Earth; in AutoCAD, your model remains in a fixed location
while the current view is updated to reflect your changes. When using orbiting, you are
navigating along a spherical path; the point you rotate around is different for each of
the three orbiting commands that is in AutoCAD. 
You can activate one of the orbit commands by doing any of the following:
 Choose View➪Orbit.
 Click a button from the 3D Navigation toolbar or the 3D Navigate panel on the
Dashboard.
 Choose an option from the 3D Navigation Modes shortcut menu.
 Enter an orbit command at the command prompt.
Table 5-2 lists the different 3D orbit commands that you can use to navigation around a
3D model.
Table 5-2
3D Orbit Commands
Button
Orbit Type 
Description
(Command Name)
Constrained (3DORBIT)
Allows you to orbit around a stationary point at the
center of the objects in the current viewpoint
when the command is started. You can adjust the
current view parallel to the current XY plane by
dragging horizontally and by dragging vertically to
move the camera along the Z axis. 
Free (3DFORBIT)
Allows you to orbit around the center point of what
is called the arcball. The arcball (see Figure 5-6)
allows you to control the orbiting around a 3D
model in four distinctly different ways. Clicking and
dragging in the small circles located at the top and
bottom of the arcball allow you to rotate the model
around the horizontal axis of the arcball, and click-
ing and dragging in the small circles on the left and
right sides of the arcball allow you to rotate the
model around the vertical axis of the arcball.
Dragging outside the arcball allows you to roll the
current view perpendicular to the screen, and
dragging inside the arcball allows you to freely
rotate the model.
Continuous (3DCORBIT)
Allows you to set the 3D model in motion on-screen
based on the direction that you specify. The model’s
orbiting speed is determined by the distance that
you cover when dragging in the direction to start
the orbiting. Dragging to start the orbiting for the
Continuous Orbit command is similar to dragging to
start the orbiting for the Constrained Orbit command. 
85
Chapter 5: Viewing a 3D Model

When working with a large model, you can select some of the objects in the drawing
before starting one of the 3D orbit commands. The objects that you select will be the
only objects that appear on-screen while the orbit command is active; this also applies
to other 3D navigation commands if they are started while one of the orbit commands
is active.
If you have an IntelliMouse or a mouse that has three buttons, you can press and
hold down the Shift key and the scroll wheel or the middle mouse button to start the
Constrained Orbit command transparently in the current viewport.
Exercise 5-5: Orbiting around a Model
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-5.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice using the 
3D orbit commands to navigation around a model.
1. Select the base in the drawing and not the flange.
2. On the Dashboard, select Constrained Orbit from the Orbit flyout on the 
3D Navigate panel.
The mounting flange disappears when the Constrained Orbit command starts.
3. Click and drag in the drawing window. Drag in a few different directions.
As you drag in different directions, the 3D model seems to rotate around a fixed
point.
4. Press 2 on the keyboard to switch to Free Orbit.
The arcball is displayed in the center of the drawing window and the mounting
flange remains invisible. 
5. Click and drag inside the arcball. Drag in a few different directions.
As you drag in different directions, notice that the 3D model doesn’t rotate quite
the same as it did with the Constrained Orbit command. 
6. Click and drag outside of the arcball and in the different small circles located
around the edge of the arcball.
Each one of these locations allows you to interactively update the current view
differently. 
Figure 5-6:

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

7. Right-click the drawing window and choose Other Navigation Modes➪
Continuous Orbit.
8. Click and drag in any direction.
The model begins to rotate on its own in the direction that you specified. The
speed at which the model orbits is based on how fast you clicked and dragged in
the drawing window. 
9. Click the drawing window to stop the model from continuously orbiting.
10. Press Esc or Enter to exit the current 3D navigation command.
11. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
Looking at a model from two different ways
AutoCAD allows you to view your 3D models in two different projections: parallel and
perspective. When using parallel projection, you see all objects in the same depth no
matter how close or far they are in the current view, which makes drawing much easier
in 3D. However, in real life, you don’t see objects in a parallel view but rather in per-
spective. In perspective, objects that appear closer to you look larger whereas objects
farther away look smaller no matter if the objects are identical in size. Figure 5-7 shows
a prototype of a level in both parallel and perspective projection. Perspective is avail-
able only when a 3D visual style is active. I talk about visual styles later in this chapter,
in the section “Giving Your 3D Models Style (Fashion Tips Not Included).”
87
Chapter 5: Viewing a 3D Model

With 2D drawings, you use only one projection. Which one and why?
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________________________________
You can switch between parallel and perspective projection with the following methods:
 Select Parallel Projection or Perspective Projection on the 3D Navigate panel on
the Dashboard.
 At the command prompt, enter perspective and enter a value of 0 to set parallel
projection active or 1 to set perspective projection active in the current view.

Exercise 5-6: Changing the Current Projection
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-6.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice switching
between parallel and perspective projection.
1. On the Dashboard, select Perspective Projection on the 3D Navigate panel.
The view changes and the front edge of the 3D model closest to you appears
taller than the back edge. You might also notice that the background color of the
drawing window changes. This is because AutoCAD is now in the 3D perspective
projection context.
2. On the Dashboard, select Parallel Projection on the 3D Navigate panel.
Both the front and back edges of the 3D model appear to be the same height
once again. 
3. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
Advanced Viewing Mechanics
Although panning, zooming, and orbiting are the most common 3D navigation methods
in AutoCAD along with using preset viewpoints, you can use a few other advanced
methods to navigate a 3D model. Other 3D navigation methods in AutoCAD allow you
to adjust the position of the current camera as you look at a 3D model, and they give
you the ability to walk/fly through a drawing — no superpowers or cape required.
Table 5-3 lists the advanced 3D navigation commands that are available.
Table 5-3
Advanced 3D Navigation Commands
Button
Navigation Method 
Description
(Command Name)
Distance (3DDISTANCE)
Allows you to interactively adjust the source of 
the camera so objects appear closer or farther
away.
Swivel (3DSWIVEL)
Allows you to change the target of the camera
interactively. Swiveling gives you the opposite
effect of orbiting; instead of rotating around the 3D
model, you are turning in a circle, causing the 3D
model to orbit around you.
Fly (3DFLY)
Allows you to interactively adjust the current view
of the drawing as if you were flying through it.
While the command is active, the camera is free to
move above the XY plane to give you the effect that
you’re lifting up into the air. As you move through
the drawing, the Z height doesn’t remain constant.
Walk (3DWALK)
Allows you to interactively adjust the current view
of the drawing as if you were walking up to it.
Unlike the Fly command, the Walk command keeps
you on the current XY plane to give you the effect
that you’re on the same plane as the model instead
of floating above it. As you move through the draw-
ing, the Z height remains constant.
88
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

Configuring Fly and Walk
You can control the distance covered in the drawing when using the Walk and Fly com-
mands by setting the step size and the number of steps per second. The more steps per
second, the more distance you cover in a shorter period of time. Similarly, the larger
the step size, the larger the distance you can cover in less time. However, the larger the
step and the more steps you take, the harder it is to see your 3D model. To specify
the step size and the steps per second, you can use the sliders/text boxes when the 
3D Navigate panel of the Dashboard is expanded or use the Walk and Fly Settings dialog
box (see Figure 5-8), which can be displayed from the Walk and Fly flyout on the 
3D Navigate panel.
Navigating with Fly and Walk
While navigating a model in the Fly and Walk modes, you use both the mouse and the
keyboard to move and look around. You can use the following keys and mouse actions
to navigate and switch between the Walk and Fly modes:
 W or ↑: Moves the camera forward.
 A or ←: Moves the camera to the left.
 S or ↓: Moves the camera backwards.
 D or →: Moves the camera to the right.
 F: Switches between Fly and Walk mode.
 Left mouse button: Swivels the camera and allows you to look around.
To use the Walk and Fly commands, you must be viewing the drawing with a perspec-
tive projection. (For information on how to toggle between parallel and perspective
projections, see the section “Looking at a model from two different ways” earlier in
this chapter.) After starting the Walk and Fly commands, the Position Locator window
is displayed to help you navigate your 3D model. The Position Locator window (see
Figure 5-9) provides you with a bird’s-eye of your model and gives you some different
ways to navigate a model from the preview window. 
Figure 5-8:

Chapter 5: Viewing a 3D Model

Exercise 5-7: Looking Around a Model
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-7.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice using the
advanced 3D navigation commands.
1. On the Dashboard, select Distance from the Camera Adjust flyout on the 
3D Navigate panel.
Click and hold down the left mouse button to make the flyout appear. Then drag
down to the Distance button and release the mouse.
2. Click and drag in the drawing window; drag up to bring the 3D model closer or
down to push it farther away.
3. On the Dashboard, select Swivel from the Camera Adjust flyout on the 
3D Navigate panel.
4. Click and drag in the drawing window; drag up and down to adjust the camera’s
target along the Z axis or left and right to adjust the camera’s target along the
XY plane.
If you keep dragging in one direction, the camera eventually goes a full 
360 degrees, returning the camera to the original target point.
5. Right-click the drawing window and choose Preset Views➪Left.
6. Press Esc or Enter to exit the Swivel navigation command.
7. On the Dashboard, select Walk and Fly Settings from the Fly and Walk flyout on
the 3D Navigate panel.
8. In the Walk and Fly Settings dialog box, select Once Per Session for Display
Instruction Window under the Settings, and make sure the Display Position
Locator Window check box is selected.
9. Under Current Drawing Settings, set the Walk/Fly Step Size to 2 and Steps Per
Second to 2.5.
10. Click OK to return to the drawing window.
11. On the Dashboard, select Walk from the Fly and Walk flyout on the 3D Navigate
panel.

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

Because you’re not in perspective projection, a Warning dialog box might dis-
play. Click Yes to continue.
12. In the Walk and Fly Navigation Mappings dialog box, click Close.
This dialog box serves as a reminder that the navigation controls are for the Fly
and Walk commands. You can control whether the dialog box displays under the
Display Instruction Window option in the Walk and Fly Settings dialog box. When
the Walk and Fly Navigation Mappings dialog box is closed, the Position Locator
window is displayed.
13. Press the W, S, A, or D key to walk up to the 3D model.
The target point of the camera is defined by the large green indicator in the
middle of the drawing window. (You can turn off the indicator and change its
color in the Position Locator window.)
14. Click in the drawing window and drag in any direction to adjust the target point
of the camera, which allows you to look left, right, up, or down.
As you adjust your viewing angle, you can see the changes in the Position Locator
window. Notice as you look up or down the PositionZ value doesn’t change. That’s
because you’re positioned on the current XY plane.
You can select the green target cone in the Position Locator window to pan,
adjust the current view of the model along the XY plane, and adjust the distance
to and from the 3D model based on where you click and drag on the green target
cone. You can also use the Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Zoom Extents tools at the
top of the Position Locator window to control how much of the 3D model you
see in the Position Locator window’s bird’s-eye preview box.
15. Press F or 7 to switch to Fly mode.
16. Press the W, A, S, or D key to fly up to the 3D model. Just like Walk mode, you can
adjust the target of the camera by clicking and dragging in the drawing window. 
As you navigate to the drawing, the PositionZ value changes based on your cur-
rent viewing angle of the 3D model. You have now left the XY plane, so you can
zoom to a specific spot in the model.
17. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
The Distance, Swivel, Fly, and Walk commands are very useful if you want to create a
quick animation through or around a 3D model using the animation feature that is in
AutoCAD. Chapter 18 covers the animation features.
Setting the Stage: Cameras and Backgrounds
Changing the viewpoint of a 3D model is a great way to access different sections of it. If
you find yourself going back to a particular view a number of times, consider using
named views or cameras. Named views and cameras are similar, with one slight differ-
ence: You can modify cameras to change the current view shown by the camera inter-
actively using grips.
After you have a named view or camera created, you can assign it a background that
appears in the current viewport when a 3D visual style is applied or a rendering is
done. I talk about visual styles later in this chapter, in the “Giving Your 3D Models Style
(Fashion Tips Not Included)” section, and Chapter 18 covers rendering. Backgrounds
91
Chapter 5: Viewing a 3D Model

give more realism to a rendering, such as the background of a factory floor where
a machine of a 3D model might be installed. You can also add your company
logo/watermark to a rendering.
Named views
Named views have existed in AutoCAD for a long time, but they’re often a forgotten
feature. Named views — as their name implies — allow you to assign a view of a 
3D model a unique name. You might create named views to help simplify navigating
your 3D model or to help ensure that the model is plotted consistently each time. 
A named view can also simplify viewing a complex model by setting up the specific
layers that should be displayed and the annotation scale that should be used for the
annotation objects in the view. Named views can also be used with the Sheet Set
Manager to help organize parts on layouts. After you create a named view, you can 
use it as one of the preset viewpoints when navigating a 3D model.
To see your named views, choose View➪Named Views to open the View Manager
dialog box (see Figure 5-10). Click the New button to create a named view in the 
New View dialog box (see Figure 5-11). You can assign your view a name, the part 
of the drawing that you want to display, and a number of additional properties: 
 Layer Snapshot: Restores the visibility states of the layers in the drawing when
the view is set current.
 UCS: Specifies which UCS should be set current when the view is set current. For
more information on the UCS, see Chapter 4.
 Live Section: Specifies which live section should be set current when the view is
set current. For more information on creating live sections, see Chapter 10.
 Visual Style: Specifies which visual style to use when the view is set current. For
more information on visual styles, see the section “Giving Your Designs Style
(Fashion Tips Not Included)” later in this chapter.
 Background: Specifies the type of background that should be used when the
view is set current. For more information on using backgrounds, see the section
“Backgrounds” later in this chapter.

You can set a named view current by choosing one from:
 The Views list in the View Manager dialog box.
 The Named Views drop-down list on the View toolbar or the 3D Navigate panel
on the Dashboard.
 The Restore option from the -VIEW command.
Exercise 5-10: Setting a Named View Current
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed5-9.dwg or Exercise5-10.dwg
from the Chapter 5 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice setting a named view current.
1. On the Dashboard, select Iso View - Conceptual from the Named Views drop-
down list on the 3D Navigate panel.
The view in the drawing changes to the settings saved with the Iso View -
Conceptual view. The drawing now appears in a perspective view based on the
defined window that you created, and the Conceptual visual style is applied.
2. Save the drawing with the name Completed5-10.dwg to the Chapter 5 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Cameras
Cameras are similar to named views with one major difference: You can interact with
cameras directly in the drawing window with what is known as a glyph. Camera glyphs
allow you to adjust the source and target points of the camera and to adjust the lens
length through the use of grips. As you modify a camera using its grips, the Camera
Preview dialog box (see Figure 5-12) shows you a preview of what will be shown when
the camera is set current. By default, camera glyphs are displayed in the drawing
window and don’t plot, but you can turn off glyphs to avoid accidental editing or
erasing of cameras in the drawing, and you can set them to plot if you want.
You can create a camera by doing any of the following:
 Choose View➪Create Camera.
 Click Create Camera on the View toolbar or the 3D Navigate panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter camera at the command prompt.
94

Backgrounds
Backgrounds add another level of realism to your models when you’re viewing, plot-
ting, or rendering them. A background might be as basic as a solid color or something
a little more elaborate that exists as an image. Backgrounds are a property of a named
view or camera that can be changed when the view is initially created or later in the
design cycle. The Background (see Figure 5-13) or Adjust Sun & Sky Background dialog
box is displayed when assigning a background to a named view or camera.

Giving Your 3D Models Style (Fashion Tips
Not Included)
When you use different visual styles, the appearance of the 3D model changes. 
With visual styles, you can see what your model looks like in wireframe when model-

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

ing, and you can use a shaded view to see what the model might look like if it were
manufactured. AutoCAD comes with five standard visual styles: One is for 2D drafting,
and the other four are for 3D modeling. The four visual styles used for 3D modeling are
 3D Wireframe: Objects are displayed using lines and curves to represent the
boundaries of 3D objects.
 3D Hidden: Outer edges of 3D objects are displayed with lines and curves, and
back faces are hidden.
 Conceptual: Objects are shaded, and edges are given a smooth look between
faces. Although the model isn’t given a realistic appearance, the shading is done
with transitions from warm to cool colors to make details of the 3D model easier 
to see.
 Realistic: Objects are shaded, and edges are given a smooth look between faces.
The shading is done using the materials and colors assigned to the faces of the
3D model.
Figure 5-15 shows a 3D model with each of the four standard visual styles used for 3D
modeling.
The Visual Styles panel (see Figure 5-16) of the Dashboard provides tools that allow
you to assign a visual style to the current viewport and even tweak the current visual
style in real time with some common properties for visual styles via sliders. To find out
more about all the different settings that you can change for a visual style when creat-
ing or modifying one, see the Customize a Visual Style topic in the AutoCAD Online
Help system. After you create a visual style, you can apply it to the current viewport or
add it to a tool palette to use it in other drawings.

You can set a visual style current in the current viewport by doing any of the following:
 Choose View➪Visual Styles and select one of the standard visual styles.
 Select a visual style from the Visual Styles drop-down list on the Visual Styles
panel of the Dashboard.
 Double-click or click the Apply button in the Visual Styles Manager palette.
Exercise 5-15: Applying a Visual Style to the Current Viewport
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed5-14.dwg or Exercise5-15.dwg
from the Chapter 5 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice assigning a visual style to the current viewport.
1. On the Dashboard, select Realistic from the Visual Styles drop-down list on the
Visual Styles panel.
The shading of the 3D model changes. 
2. Save the drawing with the name Completed5-15.dwg to the Chapter 5 folder in

Part II: Going from 2D to 3D  

AutoCAD provides some example visual styles that you can use with your 3D models
and that can show you what you can do by changing the properties to create a custom
visual style. These additional tools are on the Visual Styles tool palette that comes
with AutoCAD. To access these additional visual styles, click the icon that is in the
upper-left corner of the Visual Styles panel on the Dashboard. 
Exercise 5-16: Creating a Custom Visual Style
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed5-15.dwg or Exercise5-16.dwg
from the Chapter 5 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice creating a new visual style by copying one of the standard 3D visual
styles and making some changes to its properties.
1. On the Dashboard, click Visual Styles on the Visual Styles panel.
2. On the Visual Styles Manager palette, right-click the Conceptual visual style and
select Copy.
3. Right-click the Conceptual visual style and choose Paste.
A new visual style named Copy 1 of Conceptual is created. 
4. Right-click the Copy 1 of Conceptual visual style and choose Edit Name and
Description.
5. In the Edit Name and Description dialog box, enter My Style in the Name text box
and My custom style based on Conceptual in the Description text box.
6. Click OK to return to the Visual Styles Manager palette.
7. Double-click the My Style visual style that you just created to set it current.
8. On the Face Settings caption, click Highlight Intensity (blue ball icon) and
Opacity (transparent box with a sphere icon) located to the right of the caption.
9. Enter 15 for the value of the Highlight Intensity property and 65 for the value of
the Opacity property.
10. Under Materials and Color, select Monochrome from the drop-down list for the
Face Color Mode property.
11. Under Environment Settings, select Off from the drop-down list for the
Backgrounds property.
12. On the Edge Modifiers caption, click Jitter Edges located to the right of the
caption.
The new visual style that you created gives the 3D model a sketched look that
shows not only the front, but the back of the model as well because of the opacity
value used.
13. Save the drawing with the name Completed5-16.dwg to the Chapter 5 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Exercise 5-17: Adding a Visual Style to a Tool Palette
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed5-16.dwg or Exercise5-17a.dwg
from the Chapter 5 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice creating a new tool palette so you can use a custom visual style in
other drawings.
1. On the Dashboard, click Visual Styles on the Visual Styles panel.
2. Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Tool Palettes.
101
Chapter 5: Viewing a 3D Model

3. If the Tool Palettes window is docked, right-click the gripper bars located at the
top of the palette. If the Tool Palette window is floating, right-click the title bar.
Select the Visual Styles tool palette group.
The Visual Styles tool palette group is set current and by default has one tab on it. 
4. Right-click an empty area of the tool palette and choose New Palette.
5. In the in-place editor, enter the name My Visual Styles for the name of the tool
palette.
6. Click and drag the My Style visual style from the Visual Styles Manager palette
and drop it onto the new tool palette.
7. Open the drawing Exercise5-17b.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
8. With the Exercise5-17b.dwg active, click the My Style tool on the My Visual
Styles tool palette.
The My Style visual style is applied to the current viewport of the drawing. 
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed5-17.dwg to the Chapter 5 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
10. Close the drawing without saving any changes.
You can remove unused visual styles using the Visual Styles Manager palette or the
PURGE command. Keeping a drawing free of unnecessary information can help to
reduce confusion on what is being used in the drawing and to help keep the file size of
your drawings down.
Controlling the Display Quality of 3D Solids
AutoCAD is optimized to provide a balance of creating accurate designs and to display
a close representation of objects in the drawing window. Curved 2D objects and 3D
solids can appear in the drawing window with jagged edges at times. The jagged edges
are a result of AutoCAD displaying curved objects with short lines or vectors instead
of a calculated arc or circle. By displaying curved objects with short lines, AutoCAD
updates the display much faster by reducing the accuracy of the way the drawing is
displayed, but this doesn’t affect the actual accuracy of the objects in the drawing.

The Arc and Circle Smoothness setting on the Display tab in the Options dialog box
controls how smooth 2D and 3D curved objects in the current viewport appear. A low
value helps increase the performance of viewing large drawings in AutoCAD because it
decreases the complexity of how objects appear on-screen. Figure 5-18 shows a cone
displayed with the 3D Wireframe visual style and two different factors to control the
smoothness of the object. The cone on the left is displayed using an arc and circle
smoothness of 10, and the one on the right is displayed with an arc and circle smooth-
ness of 1000 (which is the default drawing). An arc and circle smoothness of 100 is a
nice number to help show the accuracy of a curved 3D and to increase the performance
of AutoCAD when zooming in for large drawings.
As you look at 3D solids with curves using either the 2D Wireframe or 3D Wireframe
visual style current, you see tessellation lines. Tessellation lines show the curved fea-
tures of a 3D solid when being viewed in wireframe. You can control the number of
tessellation lines that are displayed by changing the value of Contour Lines per Surface
on the Display tab of the Options dialog box. You can also set the number of tessella-
tion lines that display a curved 3D object using the Number of Lines property for a 
3D visual style. You can only set the number of tessellation lines once in AutoCAD; it’s
not a setting that can differ per object or viewport. Figure 5-19 shows a sphere (the
one on the left) with 4 tessellation lines that run longitudinal to show the curve profile
of the 3D solid, and the same sphere is shown on the right with 12 tessellation lines.
Another setting that can affect how curved 3D solids might appear in the current view-
port when the 3D Hidden, Conceptual, or Realistic visual style is current is the smooth-
ness of how shaded and rendered objects appear. The smoothness of a shaded or
rendered 3D solid is controlled by the Rendered Object Smoothness field in the Options
dialog box on the Display tab. A high value in the Rendered Object Smoothness field
makes the faces for a curved 3D solid to appear smoother, while a low value makes the
4 tessellation lines
12 tessellation lines

faces for a curved 3D solid appear blocky or jagged. The smoothness range is 0.01 to 10,
and by default it’s set to 0.5. Figure 5-20 shows two cylinders displayed with two different
smoothness factors: The one on the left is shown with a smoothness of 0.01, and the
one on the right is shown with a factor of 5.
Exercise 5-18: Changing the Display Quality of Curved 3D Solids
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise5-18.dwg from the Chapter 5 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice adjusting some
of the settings that can affect the way curved 3D solids might appear in a viewport.
1. Display the Options dialog box and click the Display tab.
2. On the Display tab, under the Display Resolution section, enter 100 in the Arc
and Circle Smoothness text box.
3. Click OK.
The sphere now appears curved instead of jagged. 
4. Display the Visual Styles Manager palette and set the 3D Wireframe visual style
current.
5. In the Visual Styles Manager palette, click the Number of Lines property under
the Edge Settings section and enter 12 in the text box. 
You can use the up and down spinners at the right side of the text box to change
the number instead of typing one.
You can also change the value of the Contour Lines Per Surface text box in the
Options dialog box. Changing the value in the Options dialog box doesn’t change
the visual style though; to use the same value each time, the visual style is set
current.
6. Choose View➪Regen to regenerate the current viewport or View➪RegenAll to
regenerate all the viewports in the entire drawing.
You should see the curves of the sphere better now than when only four tessella-
tion lines were used to represent the sphere.
7. Choose View➪3D Views➪SW Isometric.
8. Set the Realistic visual style current.
The edges of the sphere appear jagged, and gaps appear between the
tessellation lines and the shading of the sphere. 
9. Display the Options dialog box and click the Display tab.

Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. To create a custom toolbar, choose Tools➪Customize➪Interface. Then, in the Interface dialog
box, click the Customize tab.
For more information on customized toolbars, see Chapter 3.
2. With 2D drawings, you use only one projection. Which one and why?
Parallel projection. In perspective projection, objects that appear closer to you look larger,
whereas objects farther away look smaller no matter if the objects are identical in size. Using
parallel projection in a 2D drawing, which has no depth, makes no sense.
3. If you want to edit your camera’s properties through the Properties palette, how do you
display it? 
A, B, and D. You can display the Properties palette in these ways:
• Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Properties.
• Click Properties on the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar.
• Enter properties at the command prompt.

 Working with 3D modify commands
W
hen working in 3D, you have to figure out many new techniques, from entering
coordinate values to navigating around a 3D model. After you feel comfortable with
entering coordinate values and navigating in 3D, you’re ready to create 3D objects. Do not
fear; you can leverage what you already know about 2D drafting to create 3D models. The
exercises in this chapter help you set up a new drawing that you can create a 3D model
from, and I explain some of the basic 3D objects that you can create. Along with some basic
modeling techniques, you discover how to use some of the basic 3D modifying commands.
Getting Started: Creating Your First 3D Model
Creating a new drawing for 3D modeling isn’t too much different from a drawing that you might
create for drafting in 2D, but take these key differences into consideration when setting up your
drawings for creating a 3D model:
 Drawing units: Drawing units not only specify how you input distances and angles, but
also affect the scale in which blocks are inserted into a drawing and whether lighting is
set to standard units or one of the available photometric unit values. For more informa-
tion on lights and lighting units, see Chapter 16.
 Grid and snap settings: The grid is a useful visualization tool in 2D but is more helpful
in 3D because of how it’s implemented. The grid in 3D looks like a sheet of graph paper
with major and minor lines, and it gives you a visual reference between distance and
size. Snap settings work with the grid or with polar tracking to help you draw in spe-
cific increments. For more information on setting up the grip and snap spacing for use
with 3D modeling, see the “Grid and snap” section, later in this chapter. Polar tracking
and PolarSnap are also covered under the “Grid and snap” section, later in this chapter.
 Limits: Drawing limits allow you to control how large the grid is when you zoom in a
drawing. Although establishing the drawing limits is nice, it’s optional because you can
set the grid to adapt to the current size of the drawing window. For more information
on setting up drawing limits, see the “Limits” section, later in this chapter.
 Object snaps and object snap tracking: Although both object snaps and object snap
tracking aren’t stored with a drawing, you need to properly set up the features to ensure
that you accurately create your models. For more information on object snaps and object
snap tracking, see Chapter 4.

 Drawing display: When modeling, make sure you’re working in parallel projection
and the 3D Wireframe visual style to make snapping to objects easier. For more
information on visual styles and drawing projections, see Chapter 5.
 Layers: Layers organize objects in a drawing and control the visibility of the
objects on a layer. Layers are helpful when working in 3D not only to help organ-
ize parts for the model, but also to help separate construction geometry from
the final modeled parts. To help identify construction geometry, you might want
to create a layer called 3DConst or use another layer name that might be part of
your layer standards. To make sure that the objects on a construction layer
don’t get printed, mark the layer as a nonplotting layer or freeze it.
 Layouts: If you want to use the Sheet Set Manager to help organize your 3D models
or want to plot different views of your model, create layout tabs for the different
views. For more information on layouts and plotting, see Chapter 20.
 Modeling settings: If you plan on using hardware acceleration or want to have
the crosshairs or other interface elements look a specific way when you’re mod-
eling, you want to make the desired changes in the Options dialog box. For more
information on setting up the options related to 3D modeling, see Chapter 3.
 Establish the workspaces: Using the 3D Modeling workspace that comes with
AutoCAD, you can access many of the commonly used 3D-related commands. For
more information on working with workspaces, see Chapter 3.
Although named objects like dimension styles, text styles, and table styles are impor-
tant for 2D drafting, they aren’t as important when creating a 3D model. However, if
you use features like Flatshot or Livesection to create 2D drawings from your 3D
models, make sure these styles are properly set up based on your company standards.
AutoCAD comes with two drawing template files that are designed with the focus of
3D modeling. The two drawing template files (acad3D.dwt for imperial drawings and
acadiso3D.dwt for metric drawings) are very basic in what settings are established,
but they provide a basic starting point with the setup of the grid, visual style, and
drawing projection mode.
Take one of the templates that you might use for your 2D drafting and modify it for 
3D modeling so you have all your existing text, dimension, and table styles as well as
things like drawing units and snap settings.
For more information on working with drawing templates, see Chapter 2.
Grid and snap
In many applications, close might be good enough, but when you create models in
AutoCAD, you want them to be accurate because the drawings that are created from
AutoCAD are used to manufacture parts with very close tolerances. AutoCAD provides
many settings that help to ensure that models you create are accurate. One of the fea-
tures in AutoCAD that can help you create accurate models is grid and snap.
Grid is a drafting aid that allows you to create a virtual sheet of graph paper to help you
determine the distance you are creating an object at, whereas snap is used to help con-
trol the incremental distance that you move the crosshairs in across the screen. You
modify the grid and snap settings using the Drafting Settings dialog box (see Figure 6-1).
To display the Drafting Settings dialog box, choose Tools➪Drafting Settings. With the
Drafting Settings dialog box displayed, click the Grid On option to enable the use of the
grid and Snap On to enable the use of snap.
108
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

These are some of the properties that control how the grid works in 3D:
 Major Line Every: Major lines are displayed as bold or heavier lines on the grid
to help you better estimate the distance you’re moving along the grid.
 Adaptive Grid: The adaptive grid behavior ensures that the grid is displayed no
matter the current zoom factor in the drawing. The grid lines that are displayed
don’t necessarily represent the actual spacing distance set for the drawing,
though.
 Allow Subdivision Below Grid Spacing: Controls whether grid lines are displayed
if you zoom in so close that the grid lines might be too far apart to be displayed in
the current view.
 Display Grid Beyond Limits: Specifies whether the grid is displayed only at the
size the current drawing limits are set to or whether the grid can be displayed
beyond the specified drawing limits.
 Follow Dynamic UCS: If you use Dynamic UCS, this setting determines whether
the grid is relocated on the face of the 3D solid that the UCS is temporarily asso-
ciated with.
The grid in the drawing when a 3D visual style is applied is shown as a series of paral-
lel and perpendicular lines, but if a 2D visual style is applied, the grid is displayed as a
series of dots. By default, the behavior of the grid displays a major line for every fifth
minor grid line. The major grid lines are of a heavier lineweight than the minor lines,
making them appear bolder.
In combination with using the grid and snap to create accurate models, you can use
ortho mode and polar tracking to restrict the angle from the previous point that you
picked. Ortho mode restricts the crosshairs movement in 90-degree increments along
the XY plane and in the –Z or +Z direction. Polar tracking restricts the crosshairs
movement in a user-defined increment along the XY plane and in the –Z or +Z direc-
tion. To enable ortho mode, click the ORTHO button on the status bar or press the F8
key, and to enable polar tracking, click the POLAR button on the status bar or press
the F10 key. Ortho mode and polar tracking are mutually exclusive features, meaning
that one or the other is enabled but not both.

Chapter 6: Taking the Plunge into 3D

You define the angle for polar tracking on the Polar Tracking tab of the Drafting Settings
dialog box. On the Polar Tracking tab, select an angle to use from the Increment Angle
drop-down list or add one to the Additional Angles list. When using polar tracking, you
can use the PolarSnap feature to specify an increment that the crosshairs can move in.
To enable PolarSnap, display the Drafting Settings dialog box and click the Snap and
Grid tab. On the Snap and Grid tab, select PolarSnap under the Snap Type section.
When PolarSnap is enabled, enter the distance you want the crosshairs to move at in
the Polar Distance text box under the Polar Spacing section.
To enable the grid, click GRID on the status bar, right-click GRID on the status bar and
choose On, or enter grid at the command prompt and enter the option on or off. To
toggle snap on and off, click SNAP on the status bar, right-click SNAP on the status bar
and choose either PolarSnap On or Grid Snap On, or enter snap at the command
prompt and enter the option on or off.
Exercise 6-1: Adjusting the Grid and Snap 
Practice creating a new drawing based on one of the drawing templates that comes with
AutoCAD and make changes to both the grid and snap settings in the new drawing.
1. Choose File➪New.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, select the acadiso3D.dwt drawing template
file and click Open.
3. Right-click the GRID button on the status bar and choose Settings.
4. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, select the two options Snap On and Grid On
along the top of the Snap and Grid tab.
5. In the Snap Spacing section, make sure Equal X and Y spacing is selected and
then enter 1 in the Snap X spacing text box.
6. In the Grid Spacing section, enter 1 in the Grid X spacing text box and enter 10 in
the Major Line Every text box.
7. In the Snap Type section, select Grid Snap and Rectangular Snap.
8. In the Grid Behavior section, make sure Adaptive Grid, Display Grid Beyond
Limits, and Follow Dynamic UCS are all checked.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-1.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Limits
Drawing limits help control the size of the grid for the Model tab and a layout tab, but
the setting isn’t frequently used any more since the introduction of the Adaptive Grid
and Display Grid Beyond Limits options in the Drafting Settings dialog box. Drawing
limits are more commonly used for making sure that your 3D model or 2D drawing can
be plotted on a specific sheet size.
You can change the current drawing limits by choosing Format➪Drawing Limits or
entering limits at the command prompt.
Exercise 6-2: Adjusting the Limits of a Drawing 
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-2.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice setting the
drawing limits.
110

specified drawing limits. The grid displayed this way gives you a reference of the
overall size, and you can ensure that you can plot the 3D model on a specific
sheet size from the Model tab.
7. Right-click the GRID button on the status bar and choose Settings.
8. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, on the Snap and Grid tab, select the Display
Grid Beyond Limits option and click OK.
9. Choose View➪Zoom➪All.
10. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-2.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Layers
Layers are a very powerful feature in AutoCAD, and you should use them consistently
throughout each and every drawing that you create. Layers allow you to organize
objects in a drawing that are used to communicate a feature or like parts of a design.
Organizing layers allow you to make sure that groups of objects have the same entity
properties, like color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style. Layers also allow you to lock
selecting of objects and control the display of objects in the drawing window and
whether the objects on the layer can be plotted. The Layer Properties Manager dialog
box (see Figure 6-2) allows you to manage, create, and set a layer current.
When working with 3D, you want to make sure that your construction geometry is
placed on a separate layer so it doesn’t get plotted or lost when you create complex
objects.
Figure 6-2:

down list on the Layers toolbar or enter _______________ at the command prompt.
To set a layer current, you can do one of the following:
 Make sure no objects are selected and select a layer from the Layer control on
the Layers toolbar or the Layers panel on the Dashboard.
 Select an object on the layer you want to set current and click the Make Object’s
Layer Current button on the Layers toolbar or the Layers panel on the Dashboard.
To change the current layer of an object (or objects), make sure no command is active
and select the objects in the drawing using a crossing window or window selection
method and then select the Layer to set the selected objects to from the Layer control
on the Layers toolbar or the Layers panel on the Dashboard.
Exercise 6-3: Creating New Layers for Modeling
For this exercise, open either the drawing file Completed6-2.dwg or Exercise6-3.

10. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-3.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Blurring the Lines between 2D and 3D
Until recently, AutoCAD has always been primarily looked upon as a 2D drafting package
first and a 3D modeling application second. The approach that AutoCAD takes on 
3D modeling is much different from an application like Autodesk Inventor that is
designed from the ground up as a modeling program. Many of the objects that you might
already be familiar with, like arcs and circles, in AutoCAD are 2D objects. If you want to
create a circle in 3D space that is drawn at an angle, you need to adjust the UCS before
drawing the circle; otherwise, it’s a drawing on the current plane.
In addition to drawing lines with different start and end points and adjusting the UCS to
draw 2D objects in 3D space, AutoCAD provides objects and methods that allow you
to take your existing 2D geometry and create 3D objects from them or to draw true 
3D objects in 3D space you can use to create wireframe models. In this section, you
discover how to apply what you know about creating 2D objects to create 3D objects
such as 3D polylines, helixes, and extruding 2D objects. 
3D polyline
AutoCAD allows you to create two different polylines (unless you count that there are
two different 2D polylines, in which case you can create three different polylines). You
can create a 2D and a 3D polyline that are different from each other. All the points (or
vertexes) of a 2D polyline have the same Z coordinate value unless you draw it by
using a custom UCS to achieve the appearance of it being drawn with multiple different
Z values. You create 3D polylines, on the other hand, with varying Z coordinate values,
but they’re limited to straight segments only and can’t have a width assigned to them.
3D polylines are somewhat limited as objects because they lack curves and width.

Why would you want to use a 3D polyline?
______________________________________________________________________________________

You create 3D polylines by using the 3DPOLY command, and you edit them by using
grips, Properties palettes, or the PEDIT command. Figure 6-3 shows a wireframe model
of a part created using a 3D polyline.

Helix
The helix object in AutoCAD was first introduced with AutoCAD 2007, and it allows
you to create a wireframe object that looks much like a spring or spiral. A helix isn’t a
114
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

commonly used object by itself, but it is used as a path when sweeping or lofting a pro-
file to create a 3D model of a spring, coil, or the threads of a fastener like a bolt or
screw. For more information on sweeping or lofting profiles, see Chapter 8. Figure 6-4
shows helix objects that are paths to create a 3D representation of threads for a bolt.
Helixes are defined with the following characteristics:
 Turns: Overall number of turns of the spiral that makes up the helix.
 Turn Height: Height difference between two turns of the helix.
 Height: Overall height of the helix in the Z direction from the start to end point.
 Top Radius: The radius of the top turn of the helix.
 Bottom Radius: The radius of the bottom turn of the helix.
 Twist: Specifies the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) in which the helix
is turned in as it twisted.
You create a helix by choosing Draw➪Helix or entering helix at the command prompt.
You can modify helixes by using grip editing or the Properties palette. To edit a helix by
using grips, select the helix with no active command and select one of the square grips
to edit the radius of the helix or its center point. If you select one of the arrow grips,
you can modify the top radius or the height of the helix in the positive or negative 
Z direction. Figure 6-5 shows the different grips and what they’re used for.

the helix’s center point. Make sure to turn on ortho mode.
Click ORTHO on the status bar so the button is pressed in.
10. Enter 1 and press Enter to adjust the radius of the helix to 6.25.
11. Right-click and choose Properties.
12. In the Properties palette, click in the Constrain field and select Turn Height.
13. Click in the Height field and enter 36.55.
Notice that the number of turns is automatically updated to a value of 17. This
is because the Constrain for the helix was set to the turn height that the helix is
assigned.
14. Position the cursor over the drawing and press Esc to deselect the selected helix.
15. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-5.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Making 3D objects out of 2D objects
When you think of 3D modeling, the first things that might come to mind are faces and
solids, but don’t forget about 2D objects. You can use 2D objects to create 3D wire-
frames and even 3D surfaces and solids. If a line is extruded or is given a thickness, it’s
like a face of a surface model, whereas if you give a circle thickness, it’s displayed like
a hollow tube with no wall thickness; if extruded, you create a 3D solid because it’s a
closed object. Based on how you created your 2D drawings, you could start creating a
3D model based on your 2D design by extruding and giving objects thickness.
Thickness
Thickness is a property that you can assign to many basic 2D objects, such as circles,
lines, polylines, and ellipses, to give the objects height. Although an object that is given
thickness is still a 2D object, it does appear like an object created as a surface model that
116
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

is left open on the top and bottom (see Figure 6-6). By default, all 2D objects are drawn
with a thickness of 0 (zero), but you can set the default thickness value by using the
THICKNESS system variable. To set the default thickness value, enter thickness at the
command prompt and then enter the new value. Commonly, thickness is assigned to an
object after it has been created using the Properties palette.

after a
thickness is
applied.

Which two commands convert 2D objects with thickness to a 3D solid or surface?
A.
CONVTOSOLID and CONVTOSURFACE.
B.
CHANGETOSOLID and CHANGETOSURFACE.
C.
There are no commands that can be used to convert 2D objects with thickness to 3D solids
or surfaces.
Exercise 6-6: Giving 2D Objects Thickness
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-6.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice applying a
thickness to 2D objects.
1. Select all the objects in the drawing using either an implied crossing window or a
window selection method or press Ctrl+A to select all the objects in the drawing.
With no command active, select a point above and to the left of the objects in the
drawing and then a point below and to the right of the objects.
2. Right-click and choose Properties.
3. In the Properties palette, click in the Thickness field and enter 1.7.
Notice that the objects now come up off the plane into the Z direction.
4. Position the cursor over the drawing and press Esc to deselect the selected
objects.
5. Close the Properties palette.
6. At the command prompt, enter thickness and press Enter.
7. At the Enter new value for THICKNESS <0.0000>: prompt, enter 1.7 and
press Enter.
8. Choose Draw➪Circle➪Center, Radius.
9. At the Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan
radius)]: prompt, hold down the Shift key and right-click.
10. From the shortcut menu, choose Node.

11. At the _nod of prompt, select the point object that doesn’t have a circle
around it.
12. At the Specify radius of circle or [Diameter] <0.0000>: prompt,
enter 3.75 and press Enter.
The circle that you created was assigned a thickness value of 1.7 because you set
the default thickness value for new objects that are created when you specified a
value for the THICKNESS system variable.
13. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-6.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Extrude
Extruding an object is similar in concept to adding thickness to an object with several
differences. When you add thickness to an object, it remains a circle or a line no 
matter what the thickness value is. If you extrude a 2D object, AutoCAD creates a 
new 3D object that is either a surface or a 3D solid based on whether the original 2D
object was open or closed. If an open 2D object is extruded, a surface is created; if a
surface is closed, a 3D solid is created instead. You can extrude these objects:
Lines
2D and 3D splines
Circles
Planar 3D faces
Arcs
Traces
Ellipses
Regions
Elliptical arcs
Planar surfaces
2D and 3D polylines
Planar faces on a 3D solid
When extruding a 2D object, you can specify a height or distance for the extrusion,
a path, and a taper angle. A path for an extruded object can be one of the following
common objects:
Lines
2D and 3D polylines
Circles
2D and 3D splines
Arcs
Edge of a solid
Ellipses
Edge of a surface
Elliptical arcs
Helix
To create an extruded object, you can do any of the following:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Extrude.
 Click EXTRUDE on the Modeling toolbar.
 Click EXTRUDE on the 3D Make panel of the Dashboard.
 Enter extrude at the command prompt.
If you select a 2D object to extrude, the object is deleted from the drawing. If you don’t
want to delete the 2D object from the drawing, you have to set the Deletion Control
While Creating 3D Objects option in the Options dialog box on the 3D Modeling tab to
Retain Defining Geometry, or you must set the DELOBJ system variable to a value of 
0 (zero). Figure 6-7 shows a closed polyline (rectangle) extruded using a 3D polyline 
as a path to create a bent bar or rail.
118
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

Exercise 6-7: Extruding 2D Objects
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-7.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents to practice extruding a 2D object.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Extrude.
2. At the Select objects to extrude: prompt, select the 2D object in the
drawing that represents a gasket and press Enter.
3. At the Specify height of extrusion or [Direction/Path/Taper
angle] <0.0000>: prompt, enter 1.7 and press Enter.
The 2D object is extruded 1.7 units in the positive Z-direction, giving it a consistent
thickness.
4. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-7.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Modeling with Regions
Regions are 2D versions of 3D solids. Regions are flattened 3D solids that can hide
objects beyond them, and you can add and subtract them from other regions to create
complex 2D objects. You can also create a region based on the intersection of two
regions. Regions are created from closed shapes made from 2D objects — or loops.
A loop is a series of objects that form a closed object. The closed object doesn’t neces-
sarily have to be a closed object itself like a circle, an ellipse, or a closed polyline. You
can create regions from the following objects when they form a closed loop:
Lines
Elliptical arcs
Circles
2D polylines
Arcs
2D splines
Ellipses
Traces
Creating regions
You create regions by using two different techniques: the REGION command and the
Region option of the BOUNDARY command: 
 The REGION command allows you to create region objects based on either 
the closed objects that you select (such as circles or closed 2D polylines) or 
2D objects that form a closed boundary (such as lines that met endpoint to end-
point to create a closed area). Each of the closed objects and boundaries that the
Figure 6-7:
A region
object

after being
extruded.
119
Chapter 6: Taking the Plunge into 3D

REGION command extracts is known as a loop. For each loop that is extracted,
a region object is created based on the shape and size of the closed object or
boundary. You can start the REGION command by choosing Draw➪Region or
entering region at the command prompt.
 The BOUNDARY command works similarly to the way you pick points to deter-
mine the hatch boundary when using the HATCH command, but instead a region
is created based on the calculated boundary. The BOUNDARY command (choose
Draw➪Boundary) displays the Boundary Creation dialog box (see Figure 6-8),
where you can create regions based on closed objects.
Exercise 6-8: Creating a Region
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-8.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
regions from closed 2D objects.
1. Choose Draw➪Region.
2. At the Select objects: prompt, pick a point above and to the left of the 2D
objects to create window selection.
3. At the Specify opposite corner: prompt, pick a point below and to the
right of the 2D objects to complete the window selection.
4. Press Enter to end selecting objects.
The following messages are displayed at the command prompt:
9 loops extracted.
9 Regions created.
5. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-8dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Modifying regions
You can modify regions just as you do 2D objects in a drawing using basic modify oper-
ations, such as move, rotate, and copy. However, you can use a few other modify
operations with regions: union, subtract, and intersect. (The union, subtract, and
intersect operations work on 3D solids as well.) Figure 6-9 shows a number of regions
before using the UNION and SUBTRACT commands to combine and remove regions
from each other.
Figure 6-8:
The
Boundary

dialog box

120
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

Union
The UNION command allows you to combine more than one region to create a single
region. By combining multiple regions, you create a complex 2D object that you can
later use to create a 3D solid by extruding, lofting, or sweeping it. Examples of when
you might want to create complex 2D regions are for gaskets or mounting brackets to
which you can easily add holes or other features, or even for profiles that are used in
revolving operations to create a 3D model of a part. You can start the UNION command
by choosing Modify➪Solid Editing➪Union or by entering union at the command
prompt.
Subtract
To remove parts of a region, you don’t use the TRIM command, but instead you use
the SUBTRACT command. The SUBTRACT command allows you to remove one or
more regions that intersect or overlap a region. By removing parts of a region, you can
create holes or notches in a 2D region before extruding, lofting, or sweeping it to
create a 3D object. You can start the SUBTRACT command by selecting the SUBTRACT
command from the Modeling toolbar or entering subtract at the command prompt.
Intersect
The INTERSECT command allows you to create a region based on where two or more
regions overlap each other. Using INTERSECT is not very common when working 
with regions but is when working with 3D solids to subtract out a part of a solid that
interferes with another solid. You can start the INTERSECT command by selecting
INTERSECT on the 3D Make panel of the Dashboard or by entering intersect at the
command prompt.
Exercise 6-9: Modifying Regions
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed6-8.dwg or Exercise6-9.dwg
from the Chapter 6 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice unioning and subtracting regions.
1. Freeze the 3DConst layer.
Display the Layers toolbar if it isn’t currently displayed by right-clicking a tool-
bar and choosing Layers from the shortcut menu. Click the sun icon next to the
layer 3DConst from the Layers drop-down list. The icon changes to a snowflake,
indicating that the layer is now frozen.
2. Choose Modify➪Solid Editing➪Subtract.
3. At the Select solids and regions to subtract from... Select

Getting information from a region
As you might have noticed, regions are special objects based on how you’ve created and
modified them. Regions allow you to collect special information about them because
they are complex 2D objects that you can use to construct 3D solids. You use the LIST
command and Properties palette to obtain the area, perimeter, and the bounding box of
a region — the bounding box of a region is an invisible box that the region fits into. 
The MASSPROP command allows you to get even more information about a region or
3D solid. You can start the MASSPROP command in the following ways:
 Choose Tools➪Inquiry➪Region/Mass Properties.
 Click the Region/Mass Properties command on the Inquiry toolbar.
 Enter massprop at the command prompt.
You collect the following information about a region with this command:
 Centroid: A 2D or 3D coordinate value that represents the center point of the
area for a region or 3D solid.
 Moments of inertia: Determines how the distribution of the mass is done around
the X, Y, and Z axes. Values are often used to calculate things like the distrusted
loads for the bending and twisting forces generated inside a beam or the pres-
sure of fluid on a plate.
 Product of inertia: Determines the force that causes the motion of an object
with respect to two planes that are perpendicular to each other (XY, YZ, or ZX).
Values are often used to perform stress analysis.

 Radii of gyration: Another set of values that indicates the moments of inertia.
 Principal moments and X-Y directions about centroid: Determines the axis
through the centroid in which the movements of inertia are at the highest and
the axis in which they’re at the lowest.
The following is an example of the information that is displayed when using the
MASSPROP command:
----------------   REGIONS   ----------------
Area:                    2388.8453
Perimeter:               685.7656
Bounding box:         X: 0.0000  --  106.0000
Y: 0.0000  --  61.0000
Centroid:             X: 53.5588
Y: 30.5000
Moments of inertia:   X: 3497832.2813
Y: 9935701.2822
Product of inertia:  XY: 3902281.6661
Radii of gyration:    X: 38.2653
Y: 64.4919
Principal moments and X-Y directions about centroid:
I: 1275608.8982 along [1.0000 0.0000]
J: 3083193.8712 along [0.0000 1.0000]
Write analysis to a file? [Yes/No] <N>:
Before you exit the MASSPROP command, you have the option of creating a file with the
analysis information that is displayed to the Text Window. You’re prompted for a file-
name and location to save a file with the MPR extension to. You can then open the file
with a standard text editor like Notepad or a word processor like Microsoft Word.
Exercise 6-10: Collecting Information About a Region
For this exercise, open the drawing file Completed6-9.dwg or Exercise6-10.dwg
from the Chapter 6 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
Then practice collecting information about the region.
1. Choose Tools➪Inquiry➪Region/Mass Properties.
2. At the Select objects: prompt, select the region and press Enter.
3. At the Write analysis to a file? [Yes/No] <N>: prompt, enter N and
press Enter.
4. Close the drawing without saving the changes.
Modifying 3D Objects
You’ll often find yourself spending more time modifying objects than creating them in
your drawing. Although most of the modify commands that you have grown attached
to in AutoCAD are available for use when working in 3D, some are specific to working
in 3D. AutoCAD comes with 3D versions of the modify commands MOVE, ROTATE,
MIRROR, and ARRAY. Two additional commands can help you move and rotate objects
in one operation: ALIGN and 3DALIGN.
123
Chapter 6: Taking the Plunge into 3D

3D Move
You can move objects from one location to another by using a number of different
methods, but the 3DMOVE command allows you to constrain objects to one axis when
moving them. The 3DMOVE command uses what’s known as a gizmo (see Figure 6-10).
The gizmo for the 3DMOVE command is color coded to tell you which axis is going in
which direction; when you pick a base point for the gizmo, you can then specify the
axis you want the move operation to be constrained to. 
You can start the 3DMOVE command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Move.
 Click 3D Move on the Modeling toolbar or 3D Make panel on the Dashboard.
 Enter 3dmove at the command prompt.
Other ways move objects in a drawing are the following:
 The Move option with grip editing.
 The ALIGN or 3DALIGN commands.
 Select objects and then drag them with the right mouse button. After you release
the mouse button, select Move Here.
Exercise 6-11: Moving an Object in 3D
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-11.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice moving objects
using the move gizmo of the 3DMOVE command.
1. Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Move.
2. If the Selecting Subobjects on Solids dialog box is displayed, click Close.
3. At the Select objects: prompt, select the gasket (object in red) above the
main part and press Enter.

No matter where you drag in the drawing, the object is constrained to the Z axis.
8. At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:
prompt, drag the crosshairs down from the base point. Enter 12 and then press
Enter.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-11.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
3D Rotate
You can rotate objects around a base point by using a number of different methods,
but the 3DROTATE command allows you to constrain the rotation of objects to one
specific axis. The 3DROTATE command uses a gizmo (see Figure 6-11) like the 3DMOVE
command does. The gizmo for the 3DROTATE command is color coded to tell you the
direction in which an axis is going; when you pick a base point for the gizmo, you can
then specify the axis you want the rotate operation to be constrained to. 
You can start the 3DROTATE command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Rotate.
 Click 3D Rotate on the Modeling toolbar or 3D Make panel on the Dashboard.
 Enter 3drotate at the command prompt.
The ROTATE3D command is the older version of the 3DROTATE command, but it does
offer a few different options from the 3DROTATE command. One of the different options
that the ROTATE3D command offers is the ability to define the axis for rotating the
selected objects by an object, the last object, the current view, and by a specific axis.

Chapter 6: Taking the Plunge into 3D

You can rotate objects in a drawing in the following ways:
 Enter rotate at the command prompt to rotate objects along the current XY plane.
 Enter 3drotate at the command prompt to rotate objects in 3D space.
 Use the Rotate option when using grip editing.
 Enter align or 3dalign at the command prompt to rotate objects in either 2D or
3D space.
Exercise 6-12: Rotating an Object in 3D
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-12.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice rotating
objects using the rotate gizmo of the 3DROTATE command.
1. Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Rotate.
2. If the Selecting Subobjects on Solids dialog box is displayed, click Close.
3. At the Select objects: prompt, select the gasket (object in red) above the
main part and press Enter.
4. At the Specify base point: prompt, hold down the Shift key and right-click.
5. From the shortcut menu, select Center.

9. Repeat the 3DROTATE command and select the gasket again. Use the same point
for the base point as the previous rotation operation.
10. At the Pick a rotation axis: prompt, position the crosshairs over the
ribbon that runs around the X axis of the gizmo and click when it turns yellow.
11. At the Specify angle start point or type an angle: prompt, enter -5
and press Enter.
12. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-12.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
3D Align and Align
When working in 3D, you often find the need to align fasteners to a hole in a part
or where two parts might need to match up. AutoCAD offers two different methods to
align objects. Both the 3DALIGN and ALIGN commands allow you to move and rotate
objects based on source and destination points:
 3DALIGN: Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Align or enter 3dalign at the com-
mand prompt. You’re prompted to specify up to three base points and then up to
three destination points. The command also allows you to create a copy of the
selected objects before starting the alignment process.
126
Part II: Going from 2D to 3D 

 ALIGN: Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪Align or enter align at the command
prompt. You’re prompted for up to three pairs of alignment points. Unlike with
the 3DALIGN command, you specify a source point and then the matching desti-
nation point before specifying the next source point.
Exercise 6-13: Aligning Objects in 3D with the 3DALIGN Command
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-13.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice rotating and

Mirror 3D
Mirroring objects allows you to build 3D models with symmetry. Based on how your
model is designed, you might be able to mirror objects along a plane to create the
other half of the object. It’s best to use the MIRROR command when drafting in 
2D because it’s limited to the XY plane. The MIRROR3D command, however, allows 
you to mirror along a specific plane or axis that might not be on the XY plane. With 
the MIRROR3D command, you can use an object, the last object in the drawing, the
current view, or three points to specify the plane to mirror the selected objects. You
can also use the Z axis or the XY, YZ, or ZX plane to mirror the selected objects. You
start the MIRROR3D command by choosing Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Mirror or
entering mirror3d at the command prompt.
Exercise 6-15: Mirroring an Object in 3D
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-15.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice mirroring
objects in 3D using the MIRROR3D command to create a symmetrical part.
1. Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Mirror.
2. At the Select objects: prompt, select the bracket and press Enter.
3. At the Specify first point of mirror plane (3 points) or
[Object/Last/Zaxis/View/XY/YZ/ZX/3points] <3points>: prompt,
hold down the Shift key and right-click.

Choose Modify➪Solid Editing➪Union and then select both halves of the part.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed6-15.dwg to the Chapter 6 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
3D Array
Mirroring objects makes it easy to create symmetrical objects, whereas arraying
objects allows you to create repeating patterns. The ARRAY command allows you to
array objects in a rectangular or polar pattern on the XY plane, but the 3DARRAY com-
mand allows you to create rectangular arrays with an additional direction, and the
polar option allows you to specify the axis of rotation for the array. When creating a
rectangular array with the 3DARRAY command when compared to the ARRAY com-
mand, you have an additional direction for the array known as a level — which is the
number of times you want the array to be defined in the Z direction. You start the
3DARRAY command by choosing Modify➪3D Operations➪3D Array or entering
3darray at the command prompt.
Exercise 6-16: Creating a 3D Rectangular Array
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise6-16.dwg from the Chapter 6 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 
3D array of holes in a rail.

Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. To find which layer is current, look at the current value displayed on the Layers drop-down
list on the Layers toolbar or enter status at the command prompt.
2. Why would you want to use a 3D polyline? 
They’re often used as paths for lofting or extruding objects and creating 3D wireframe models.
3. Which two commands convert 2D objects with thickness to a 3D solid or surface? 
A. You can use the commands CONVTOSOLID and CONVTOSURFACE to convert some open
and closed 2D objects with thickness to a solid or surface. CONVTOSOLID converts a closed
polyline or circle to a solid. CONVTOSURFACE converts a line, an arc, or an open zero-width
polyline to a surface.
4. What menu command do you choose to intersect a region?
Choose Modify➪Solid Editing➪Intersect. At the Select objects prompt, select the objects
you want to join together.

In This Chapter
 Reinforcing concepts used to navigate 3D models
 Reinforcing concepts used in moving from 2D to 3D
I
n the previous chapters of Part II, you practice some of the basic concepts of working in
the third dimension, viewing a drawing, and performing some basic creation and modifi-
cation of 3D objects. The exercises in this chapter have you working with a small rear
assembly of a custom motorcycle. By using a small assembly of parts, you get comfortable
working with many different parts in a drawing at a time and establish a good understand-
ing of the workflow when working with more than one part at a time. 
Navigating a 3D Model
In this series of exercises, you work with the assembly of parts that make up the rear assem-
bly of a custom motorcycle. You navigate and use some of the different visualization features
from preceding chapters in this part of the book.
Exercise 7-1: Navigating an Assembly of Parts
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise7-1.dwg from the Chapter 7 folder in the
My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice navigating around the
assembly.
1. View the assembly from the left by choosing View➪3D View➪Left.
A number of parts show through the openings on the rim.
2. Select the swing arm (indicated by the arrow in Figure 7-1) and choose View➪Orbit➪
Constrained Orbit. 
All the parts except for the swing arm are hidden.
3. Click and drag in the drawing window in various different directions to view the swing
arm from different angles.
4. With the constrained orbit still active, right-click and choose Preset Views➪
SE Isometric.
5. Press Esc to exit the constrained orbit mode.
All the other parts of the assembly return.

Taking a 2D Drawing and 
Creating a 3D Part
In this series of exercises, you create a new part from a 2D drawing and then place it in
the drawing that contains the assembly. To create the new 3D part, you create a couple
of regions and then extrude them to create the new part. You then reference the new
part into the assembly and align it into the correct location where it’s attached to the
swing arm.
Exercise 7-3: Starting with a 2D Drawing and Ending with a 3D Part
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise7-3.dwg from the Chapter 7 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
part from an existing 2D drawing.
1. Activate Model space by clicking the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing
window or clicking the Model button on the status bar when the layout tabs
aren’t displayed.
2. Turn off the Dims layer and create two new layers. Name one of the new layers

Part III
3D Modeling — 
Solid Modeling

In this part . . .
You can create solid models by using two different
approaches. You can create 3D primitive geometry
such as spheres and boxes, or you can use 2D and 3D
objects with complex operations to create a 3D model.
Most models that you create are based on a combination
of both approaches. As you create 3D models with 3D
solids, you find out how to create primitive and complex
3D solids and then modify them to add features such as
holes, dimples, fillets and rounds, and bevels.
Although you might start with a 2D drawing to create a 3D
model, AutoCAD allows you to create 2D objects from
views of a 3D model created with 3D solids. The objects
that are created from the views of a 3D model can be used
to create a set of 2D drawings that contain hidden lines,
hatches or fills, text, and dimensions to communicate how
parts of a 3D model should be manufactured.

Chapter 8
Modeling with Solids
In This Chapter
 Working with solids
 Creating primitive solids
 Creating complex solids
B
uilding 3D solids is the most flexible way to create 3D models in AutoCAD due to the
ease of creating and modifying them. 3D solids were improved (more or less they saw
a complete overhaul) in AutoCAD 2007 to be more flexible so they could be used to create
both conceptual and dimensionally accurate models. The exercises in this chapter show
you how to create primitive and complex 3D solids.
Working with 3D Solids
In the preceding chapter, you create 3D objects by adding thickness to and extruding 2D
objects to create a 3D solid. Although starting with 2D objects is one way to model in 3D,
it isn’t the only way. AutoCAD allows you to create two different classifications of 3D solids:
primitive solids and complex solids. When you create a complex solid by extruding the
region, it’s a complex solid because it contains a number of features like holes and fillets.
Primitive solids
Primitive solids (affectionately called primitives) are basic geometric shapes that create 3D
models. AutoCAD allows you to create eight different 3D solid primitives (see Figure 8-1). The
primitives fall into two categories: those with straight edges and those with curves. Okay, so
most of the primitives fall into two categories nicely with the exception of what’s called a
polysolid. A polysolid is the 3D solid version of a polyline, which can be made up of both
straight and curved segments. 
Prior to AutoCAD 2007, you could create 3D solid primitives. However, often the 3D solid sud-
denly got a case of amnesia and forgot what type of primitive it was. This problem made it
very difficult to make changes to the 3D object. 3D solid primitives starting with AutoCAD
2007 could be modified using grips to change their size and shape, which gave users much
greater control of doing conceptual models without having to resort to re-creating the object
because it remembered what type of primitive it was.

Complex solids
Complex solids are created when you combine or subtract primitive solids from each
other or create 3D solids from closed 2D objects (also known as profiles) through
operations like lofting, sweeping, or extruding (see Figure 8-2). Chapter 6 covers
adding two or more regions together to create a single region, subtracting one or more
regions from a region, and creating a new region based on where two or more regions
overlap; the same holds true for 3D solids. In Chapter 6, I introduce extruding a closed
2D object to create a new 3D solid. You can create complex solids later in this chapter,
in the section “Nothing Complex about These Solids.” Most of the 3D models that you
create will very likely be made up of complex solids that were created from primitives
or that started off being 2D objects.

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 

Solids that Follow the Straight
(And Narrow)
AutoCAD allows you to create four different types of primitives that have straight edges,
and one of them can contain both straight and curved edges. The 3D solid primitives
that have straight edges are box, wedge, pyramid, and polysolid.
Box
A box is one of the more common types of primitive 3D solids that you can create. You
can create a box as a cube with all sides being the same size or a rectangular shape
with the ends being the same size (see Figure 8-3). When you have a box, you can use
it to create a rail for a machine or create a mounting flange.
You create a box in the following ways:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Box.
 Click Box on the Modeling toolbar or the 3D Make panel on the Dashboard.
 Enter box at the command prompt.
Exercise 8-1: Creating a 3D Solid Box
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise8-1.dwg from the Chapter 8 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
solid primitive of a box.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Box.
2. At the Specify first corner or [Center]: prompt, enter 0,0,0 and press
Enter to specify the first corner of the box.
You can also enter C to use the Center option, which allows you to create a box
by specifying the length, width, and height of the box from its true center point. 
3. At the Specify other corner or [Cube/Length]: prompt, drag the
crosshairs to 155,200 and click to specify the width and length of the box.
You can also enter C for the Cube option to create a box with all equal sides or
enter L to specify the length of the box.

Wedge
Wedges are boxes that are cut in half diagonally from an upper to lower edge. When
creating a wedge, you can create it as a cube with all sides being the same size, with
the exception of the diagonal face or a rectangular shape (see Figure 8-4).

Exercise 8-2: Creating a 3D Solid Wedge
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise8-2.dwg from the Chapter 8 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
solid primitive of a wedge.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Wedge.
2. At the Specify first corner or [Center]: prompt, enter C and press
Enter to create a wedge from the center of the object.
3. At the Specify corner: prompt, drag the crosshairs to 35,35 and click to spec-
ify the width and length of the wedge.
4. At the Specify other corner or [Cube/Length]: prompt, drag the
crosshairs to 70,70 and click to specify the length of the wedge.
You can also enter C for the Cube option to create a wedge with all equal sides or
enter L to specify the length of the wedge. 
5. At the Specify height or [2Point] <5.0000>: prompt, enter 15 and
press Enter to specify the height of the wedge.
6. Use one of the orbiting commands to look at the wedge from different angles.
Because you created the wedge by using the Center option, the object is created
above and below the working plane.
To start one of the 3D orbiting commands, choose View➪Orbit and then one of
the items under the Orbit submenu.
Hold down the Shift key and middle mouse button to enter transparent orbiting.
7. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-2.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Pyramid
Pyramids are objects that have a flat base, a height, and can be made up of 3 to 32
sides that run up (or down) from the base to the top of the object. Pyramids can repre-
sent the head of a bolt or a custom fitting to the end of a crank or shaft. What makes a
pyramid a unique and useful object is that it can have a point at the top (similar to a
typical pyramid in Egypt) or it can be flat, which allows you to create a uniform poly-
gon with multiple sides, forming a shaft that’s hexagon shaped.
When creating a pyramid, you specify the center point of the base and then its radius
value (which can be inscribed or circumscribed) like the process of creating a polygon
with the POLYGON command. You can also define a pyramid by specifying the length
of one of the edges of the base to calculate the overall base size for the pyramid. After
you define the base of the pyramid, you’re prompted to define its height and the top
radius that defines whether it is created with a pointy or flat top. If you need a radius
for the top, you’re prompted to specify the height of the pyramid after the radius is
specified. Figure 8-5 shows some of the different types of pyramids that you can create
in AutoCAD.
145
Chapter 8: Modeling with Solids

To create a pyramid, start the command in any of the following ways:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Pyramid.
 Click Pyramid either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter pyramid at the command prompt.
Exercise 8-3: Creating a 3D Solid Pyramid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise8-3.dwg from the Chapter 8 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
solid primitive of a pyramid.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Pyramid.
2. At the Specify center point of base or [Edge/Sides]: prompt, enter
S and press Enter.
3. At the Enter number of sides <3>: prompt, enter 6 and press Enter.
4. At the Specify center point of base or [Edge/Sides]: prompt, enter
0,0 and press Enter.
If you know the length of one of the edges, enter E and specify the length. The
radius of the base is calculated automatically. 
5. At the Specify base radius or [Inscribed] <38.8150>: prompt, enter
80 and press Enter to specify the size of the base for the pyramid.
6. At the Specify height or [2Point/Axis endpoint/Top radius]
<15.0000>: prompt, enter T and press Enter to specify the top radius for the
pyramid.
7. At the Specify top radius <82.6851>: prompt, enter 75 and press Enter.
8. At the Specify height or [2Point/Axis endpoint] <15.0000>:
prompt, enter 30 and press Enter.
The pyramid tapers towards the top. This is because the base is larger than the
radius for the top of the pyramid. If you enter 0 (zero) for the top radius, the
pyramid forms a point.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-3.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Polysolid
Polysolids are similar in appearance and functionality to 2D polylines with both width
and thickness. But a 2D polyline with width and thickness is still not a 3D solid. Like 2D
polylines, polysolids are made up of a combination of straight and curved segments.
When you create a polysolid, you can specify points to draw straight or curved seg-
ments, or you can select an object. You can select a line, 2D polyline, 2D spline, arc, or
circle to create a polysolid from. When you select an object or specify points to create
a polysolid, you can specify the width, height, and justification values to use. Figure 8-6
shows several examples of polysolids, from a straight hollow tube to a U-channel.
You can create a polysolid with any of the following methods:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Polysolid.
 Click Polysolid either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter polysolid at the command prompt.
Exercise 8-4: Creating a 3D Polysolid

the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Solids with Curves
Not all 3D models are created with solids that have straight edges, like boxes or pyra-
mids. AutoCAD comes with several 3D solid primitives that have curved surfaces.
Curved solids allow you to make features like holes in mounting plates or spacers
between mechanical fasteners. 
Sphere
A sphere is a ball-like object that is defined like a circle (see Figure 8-7). You can define
a sphere by specifying a center point and then a radius or diameter value. You might
use a sphere for the balls in a ball bearing or the end on a hexagon cap nut. Because
you create a sphere based on its center point, half the sphere is created above and
below the current working plane or the specified point.
You create a sphere in any of the following ways:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Sphere.
 Click Sphere either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter sphere at the command prompt.
Figure 8-7:

press Enter.
You can enter D to specify the diameter of the sphere. 
4. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-5.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Cylinder
A cylinder is a long, circular object that’s similar to a circle with thickness. You can
define a cylinder by specifying a center point for the base, the radius or diameter of
the base, and its height. A cylinder can be circular or elliptical (see Figure 8-8). A cylin-
der might be a shaft that connects a sprocket to a motor, a tool for punching a hole
into a mounting plate, a hub of a pulley, or even a roller for a conveyor belt.

enter A for the Axis endpoint option to rotate the cylinder using the center point
of its base as the rotation point and to specify its height at the same time.
5. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-6.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Cone
Cones are objects that have either a peak or a flat top with a circular or elliptical base
(see Figure 8-9). When you define a cone, you specify the center point of the base, the
radius or diameter of the base, and its height and/or top radius. You can use a cone to
model the end of a grease fitting or the head of a screw.
Figure 8-9:
Cones

Torus
A torus is a doughnut-shaped object and is one of the least used 3D solid primitives
that AutoCAD offers (see Figure 8-10). As you define a torus, you specify the center
point of the object, the outer radius or diameter of the torus at its equator, and then
the radius or diameter of the tube. A torus might be used as a rubber spacer or to
create a raised area around a hole.

Nothing Complex about These Solids
Creating complex solids doesn’t require an advanced math degree; they just require
some additional input. You create complex solids by taking two or more solids and
performing a union operation on them to create a single 3D solid, or you can take a
closed 2D object and sweep it along a path to create a 3D solid, like a bent hose or
tube. Complex solids form the final model.
You find out about the EXTRUDE command in Chapter 6, which allows you to take an
open or a closed 2D object to create a 3D solid or surface. In this section, you create
complex 3D solids from primitives and closed 2D objects (profiles).
Add some of this and remove a little of that
Regions (see Chapter 6) and 3D solids are very close to each other in the way they can
be combined or subtracted from each other to create a new complex object. You can
use the same commands that you use on regions on 3D solids — UNION, SUBTRACT,
and INTERSECT. The INTERSECT command makes a lot more sense when working with
3D solids than it does with regions, though. AutoCAD also provides the INTERFERE
command, which is similar to the INTERSECT command, to create a new 3D solid
based on how selected 3D solids intersect.
The original objects that you select when using the UNION, SUBTRACT, and 
INTERSECT commands aren’t retained when you create complex 3D solids. If you 
want to retain the original objects before creating a complex 3D solid with one of these
commands, create a copy of the objects in the drawing first. After you create a copy of
the objects, perform the desired operation on the 3D solids. When revolving, sweep-
ing, or lofting objects, you can retain the original objects by setting the system vari-
able DELOBJ to the value of 0 (zero).
One solid plus one solid equals a new solid
Creating primitive 3D objects is an important part of modeling in AutoCAD, but creating
primitives alone doesn’t allow you to calculate values such as mass or the centroid of a
part. You must combine solids in order to determine these values. The UNION command
(Modify➪Solid Editing➪Union) combines two or more 3D solids into a single object.
Figure 8-11 shows an example of a 3D solid that was created by unioning two solids
together to form a single complex solid. You can tell the solids have been unioned
together in the 3D solid on the right by the missing edge lines in the lower-right corner
and along the back side of the 3D solid.

3D solids is

Taking away from a solid
Subtracting from a 3D solid is the opposite of adding to one. You don’t use the TRIM
command to remove part of a 3D solid for features like holes or indents. The SUBTRACT
command (Modify➪Solid Editing➪Subtract) removes parts of selected 3D solids that
intersect another 3D solid. Figure 8-12 shows a 3D solid before and after a cylinder was
subtracted from it.
Exercise 8-10: Subtracting a 3D Solid from Another 3D Solid

When solids intersect
It’s possible to create a new 3D solid based on the area that two 3D solids have in
common; essentially, it’s the area that the 3D solids intersect. The INTERSECT com-
mand (Modify➪Solid Editing➪Intersect) keeps the shared areas of two solids that are
used to sculpt and alter the shape of a 3D solid to create new contours or features.
Figure 8-13 shows two 3D solids that intersect and the result of using the INTERSECT
command on them.
Exercise 8-11: Creating a New 3D Solid through the Intersection

Interference!!!
Checking for interference between two solids is a common practice when working with
3D models to make sure there is clearance between parts. Interference between two or
more solids is when two or more solids intersect or cross through each other (not when
Figure 8-13:
Creating a
new 3D
solid based
on the inter-
section of
two 3D
solids.
155
Chapter 8: Modeling with Solids

edges or faces touch). The INTERFERE command (Modify➪Solid Editing➪Interference
Checking) checks to see whether 3D solids intersect, and it’s similar to the INTERSECT
command with a few differences. By default, the INTERSECT command deletes the origi-
nal objects, whereas the INTERFERE command retains the original objects and creates a
new 3D object in the location where the 3D solids intersect.
The INTERFERE command allows you to see the new 3D solids that could be created
based on the intersecting areas of the selected 3D solids. After you select the pairs of 3D
solids to check, the Interference Checking dialog box (see Figure 8-14) is displayed. The
Interference Checking dialog box allows you to step through each of the different sets of
the 3D solids that you selected. By finding issues with intersecting 3D solids during the
design process, you avoid lost time when creating prototypes or even during produc-
tion. Figure 8-15 shows the area where two 3D solids intersect in a shaded view.
Exercise 8-12: Creating a New 3D Solid Based on the Interference 
of Two 3D Solids

As the model revolves
Extruding 2D objects is great for creating an object with thickness or having an object
follow a path, but you can revolve a 2D object around an axis to create circular 3D solids.
Figure 8-16 shows the results of revolving a region around a line to create a 3D solid. You
can revolve closed 2D objects to create hubs, pulleys, or even shafts.
By default, when you use the REVOLVE command, the closed 2D objects that you
select to revolve are deleted. If you want to retain the closed 2D objects used to create
the revolved 3D solid, set the system variable DELOBJ to a value of 0 (zero). You can
change the value of DELOBJ by entering delobj at the command prompt and then
entering 0 (zero).
You can revolve a closed 2D object to create a 3D solid with the following methods:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Revolve.
 Click Revolve either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter revolve at the command prompt.

Sweeping
Sweeping in AutoCAD has nothing to do with getting rid of dust bunnies in the corner
of your drawing. Rather, sweeping is a technique that you can use to create complex 3D
solids. When you create a 3D solid by sweeping, you select a closed 2D object (or pro-
file) and send it along a path. The path that you select can be either an open object
such as a line or helix or a closed object such as a circle or closed polyline. You can
sweep a 2D object to create a tube that follows a specific angle, the threads on a
mechanical fastener, or even a drive belt that runs around several pulleys. Figure 8-17
shows a closed 2D object and a path that is used to create a 3D model of a drive belt.

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 

By default, when you use the SWEEP command, the closed 2D objects that you select to
sweep are deleted. If you want to retain the closed 2D objects used to create the swept
3D solid, set the system variable DELOBJ to a value of 0 (zero). You can change the
value of DELOBJ by entering delobj at the command prompt and then entering 0 (zero).
You can sweep a closed 2D object to create a 3D solid with the following methods:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Sweep.
 Click Sweep either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter sweep at the command prompt.
Exercise 8-14: Sweeping a Closed 2D Object to Create a 3D Solid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise8-14.dwg from the Chapter 8 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
solid by sweeping a closed 2D object along a path.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Sweep.
2. At the Select objects to sweep: prompt, select the closed 2D object indi-
cated by the arrow in Figure 8-12 (shown earlier) and press Enter.
3. At the Select sweep path or [Alignment/Base point/Scale/Twist]:
prompt, select the closed 2D polyline.
You can also use one of the options to adjust the way the final 3D solid is created.
4. Turn on the layer Parts and turn off the layer Construction Geometry.
Three pulleys are displayed, and the path that you used to sweep the closed 2D
object is hidden.
Click the light-bulb icon next to the Parts and Construction Geometry layers on
the Layers drop-down list on the Layers toolbar or in the Layers Properties
Manager (Format➪Layer)
5. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-14.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Lofting around
No, lofting isn’t something you do in your loafers around the house while modeling in
AutoCAD. Lofting is a 3D modeling technique that allows you to create 3D solids based
on cross sections created from closed 2D objects. The order you select the cross 
sections in affects how the 3D solid is created. Figure 8-18 shows the cross sections
and guide used to create the basics of a 3D model of a bolt using lofting. Along with
cross sections to define the 3D solid, you can use a path and guides to help define
what the final 3D solid will look like. If you use cross sections only, the Loft Settings
dialog box (see Figure 8-19) is displayed to help you fine-tune what the lofted 3D solid
will look like.
159
Chapter 8: Modeling with Solids

By default, when you use the LOFT command, the closed 2D objects that you select to
loft are deleted. If you want to retain the closed 2D objects used to create the lofted 3D
solid, set the system variable DELOBJ to a value of 0 (zero). You can change the value
of DELOBJ by entering delobj at the command prompt and then entering 0 (zero).
You can loft closed 2D objects to create a 3D solid with the following methods:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Loft.
 Click Loft either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter loft at the command prompt.
Exercise 8-15: Lofting Closed 2D Objects to Create a 3D Solid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise8-15.dwg from the Chapter 8 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating a 3D
solid by using several different cross sections to create a lofted 3D solid.
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Loft.
2. At the Select cross sections in lofting order: prompt, select the
cross sections in the order indicated by Figure 8-20.

Sections Only.
The Loft Settings dialog box is displayed. If you have a path or guide to use when
lofting, choose the appropriate option.
5. In the Loft Settings dialog box, select Ruled under the Surface Control at Cross
Sections.
Select one of the other options if you need to or want to see how these options
affect the final lofted object. If the Preview Changes check box is selected, the
lofted 3D solid changes in the drawing in real time as you make changes in the
Loft Settings dialog box. 
6. Click OK to create the lofted 3D solid.
7. Use the 3DORBIT command to view the lofted object.
To start one of the 3D orbiting commands, choose View➪Orbit and then one of
the items under the Orbit submenu.
Hold down the Shift key and middle mouse button to enter transparent orbiting.
8. Save the drawing with the name Completed8-15.dwg to the Chapter 8 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Converting objects to 3D solids
Starting with AutoCAD 2007, you can convert 2D objects to 3D solids objects by using
the CONVTOSOLID command (Modify➪3D Operations➪Convert to Solid). To create
extruded 3D solids from 2D objects, select one of the 2D objects compatible with 
the command. The objects that you can select must be closed and have thickness
assigned to them. The CONVTOSOLID command allows you to convert the following
objects to extruded 3D solid objects:
 Circle with thickness
 2D polyline with thickness and no width
 2D polyline with thickness and uniform width
You can also convert 2D objects into 3D surfaces by using the CONVTOSURFACE com-
mand. To discover more about the CONVTOSURFACE command, see Chapter 13.

Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. When is a wedge useful? 
A. Wedges are helpful when you need an inclined plane or a shim because a wedge is a sloped
box that has no height on one end and a specified height on the other end, which allows for a
transition from one plane to another. Answer B is wrong because the edges of a slot for a
mechanical fastener like a screw don’t converge to a sharp edge, and C is not true because
wedges are created from straight edges and not curved edges.
2. How is a cylinder different from a circle with thickness?
C. A cylinder is capped at the top and bottom, whereas a circle with thickness is not. Answer A
is wrong because both circles and 3D solid cylinders can be grip-edited even though they can be
edited in different ways. Answer B is also incorrect because they’re different types of objects.
3. How is a torus similar to a sphere in the way they’re created? 
Just like the sphere, a torus is created half above and half below the center point specified.

Modifying and Analyzing Solids
In This Chapter
 Modifying solids
 Obtaining information from a model
T
he preceding chapter tells you about primitive and complex 3D solids and how to create
them. After you have created 3D primitives or complex 3D solids, you most likely have
to modify the 3D solids so your 3D model has the final look it needs. When modifying 3D
solids, you can add features like fillets and bevels, or you can even change the shape of a 3D
solid that was used to make a complex object if the dimensions of a part change. The exer-
cises in this chapter show you how to modify primitive and complex 3D solids and to get
some information from the 3D model to help ensure that the design is safe for its applica-
tion.
Modifying 3D Solids
Creating 3D solids is only part of the puzzle when modeling in AutoCAD. After you create a
3D solid, whether it’s primitive or complex, you most likely still have to modify the object in
some way to create the final modeled part. In Chapter 6, I cover some of the basic commands
that you can use to modify both 3D solids and surfaces: 3DMOVE, 3DROTATE, MIRROR3D,
ALIGN, 3DALIGN, and 3DARRAY. I also cover the commands UNION, SUBTRACT, INTERSECT,
and INTERFERE in Chapter 8, which allow you to modify 3D solids.
You can modify a 3D solid in other ways:
 The Properties palette allows you to modify some of the dimensional properties of 3D
solid primitives.
 Grip editing allows you to modify a 3D solid in different ways. The type of grips that are
displayed for the 3D solid depends on whether it is a primitive or complex 3D solid.
 You can select the subobjects of a 3D solid (edge, face, or vertex) and change their
properties using the Properties palette or grips.
 Add fillets and chamfers by using the FILLET and CHAMFER commands.
 Slice a 3D solid so you can dimension parts of the model or to show some of the inter-
nal features of a model with the SLICE command.
 The SOLIDEDIT command gives you the ability to manipulate the faces, edges, or body
of a 3D solid in many different ways. With the SOLIDEDIT command, you can assign
materials for rendering the model (see Chapter 17 for more on materials) and move or
rotate a face on a solid.

 You can imprint 2D objects onto the face of a 3D solid so you can extrude geome-
try to create new complex 3D solids or to create new faces to add materials,
among other options, with the IMPRINT command.
 Extrude closed boundaries to create new 3D solids or to modify the face on a 3D
solid with the PRESSPULL command.

Properties palette
You can use the Properties palette (see Figure 9-1) to change the dimensional properties
of 3D solid primitives and other settings that can affect the visual appearance of a model
or the way you can edit 3D solids. The Properties palette is a modeless dialog box that
allows you to modify the properties of a 3D solid in the drawing, such as its height,
width, radius, and many other properties that can be modified with or without grips.

You can change the properties of an object by selecting the object first and then
displaying the Properties palette, or you can display the Properties palette and
then select the object you want to modify. Display the Properties palette in the follow-
ing ways:
 Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Properties.
 Click Properties on the Standard or Standard Annotation toolbar.
 Select an object and right-click to display an object shortcut menu. Choose
Properties from the shortcut menu.
 Press Ctrl+1.
 Enter properties at the command prompt.
After you select an object, its properties are displayed in different categories on the
Properties palette, such as General, 3D Visualization, Geometry, and Solid History.
Under each category are specific properties that you can edit or which are read-only
for the selected object. You can select more than one object at a time, and the
common properties for the selected objects are displayed. If any common properties
have different values from each of the selected objects, the text Varies is displayed in
the field.
Exercise 9-1: Modifying 3D Solids Using the Properties Palette
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-1.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice modifying a
box and cylinder 3D solid primitives using the Properties palette.
1. Select the box and right-click.
2. Choose Properties from the shortcut menu to display the Properties palette.
3. On the Properties palette, select the Length field and enter 91.
4. Select the Width field and enter 93.
5. Enter 45.5 in the Position X field and 46.5 in the Position Y field.
6. Press Esc and select the cylinder.
7. Enter 56 in the Position X field, 46.5 in the Position Y field, and 7.65 in the
Position Z field.
8. Select the Height field and enter 22.35.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed9-1.dwg to the Chapter 9 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Grip editing
Grips are a powerful way to quickly modify 2D objects and an equally powerful way to
modify 3D solids. Prior to AutoCAD 2007, it wasn’t possible to modify 3D solids using
grips (with the exception of moving a 3D solid using a single base grip). Starting with
AutoCAD 2007, support for grip editing for 3D solids was added. One of the main
changes that allowed for the introduction of grip editing for 3D solids was that the
objects retained an understanding of what type of primitive they were or complex 3D
solid in the cases where the 3D solid was created through lofting, sweeping, or extrud-
ing closed 2D objects.
165
Chapter 9: Modifying and Analyzing Solids

To use grips to modify a 3D solid, make sure no command is active and select a 3D
solid you want to edit. When the grips are displayed for the 3D solid, click one of the
grips and drag in the drawing window to modify the 3D solid; click in the drawing to
set the new value. Depending on the type of 3D solid you’re editing, you get a different
number and types of grips. For example, if you select a 3D solid box primitive, 11 grips
are displayed (see Figure 9-2). The grips allow you to adjust the height, width, and
length of the box along with being able to move the box using its base point. 
If the grips aren’t displayed for the selected 3D solid, choose Tools➪Options to display
the Options dialog box. In the Options dialog box, click the Selection tab and select the
Enable Grips check box under the Grips section. You can also change the color and
size for the displayed grips under the Grip Size and Grips sections.
Exercise 9-2: Modifying 3D Solids with Grips
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-2.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice modifying a
box and cylinder 3D solid primitives using grips.
1. Turn on ortho mode, turn off object snap, and turn on dynamic input.
To turn on ortho mode, click ORTHO on the status bar until the message <Ortho
off> is displayed in the command line window and the ORTHO button appears
popped in. To turn off object snap, click OSNAP on the status bar until the mes-
sage <Osnap off> is displayed in the command line window and the OSNAP
button appears popped out. To turn on dynamic input, click DYN on the status
bar so that the DYN button appears depressed.
2. Select the box to display its grips and select the rightmost grip, indicated by 1 in
Figure 9-3.
3. Drag to the crosshairs to the right to establish the use of direct distance entry.
Enter 12 and press Enter to change the size of the box 12 units in the X direction.
4. Select the topmost grip, indicated by 2 in Figure 9-3, and drag the crosshairs
away from the center of the box.
5. Enter 15 and press Enter to change the size of the box 15 units in the Y direction.
6. Press Esc to clear the grips on the box.

7. Select the cylinder to display its grips and click the square grip at the bottom of
the cylinder indicated by 3 in Figure 9-3.
8. At the command prompt, enter #56,46.5,7.65 and press Enter.
Using the pound (#) symbol when entering coordinates at the dynamic input
tells AutoCAD to use the absolute Cartesian coordinate value. If you omit the # in
this case, the coordinates are evaluated as relative coordinate values because
dynamic input is turned on. To find out more about the special symbols that you
can use for evaluating coordinate values with dynamic input enabled, see the
topic Enter 3D Cartesian Coordinates in AutoCAD’s Online Help system.
9. Select the triangle grip that points upward, located at the center of the cylinder
(indicated by 4 in Figure 9-3), and drag the crosshairs towards the top of the
drawing window.
10. Enter 7.6 and press Enter to adjust the height of the cylinder.
11. Save the drawing with the name Completed9-2.dwg to the Chapter 9 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Selecting a subobject
Selecting 3D solids to modify isn’t much different from selecting 2D objects such as
lines and arcs, but there are a few unique exceptions. With 3D solids, you can use the
standard object selection methods that you’ve been using since you first started work-
ing with AutoCAD, which include implied windowing, fences, single picking, and the
other object-selection methods that AutoCAD offers. In addition to the standard object
selection methods, you can perform what’s known as a subobject selection.

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 
Figure 9-4 shows the elements that make up a 3D solid: face, edge, and vertex. To
select a subobject of a 3D solid, you can use the SUbobject option at the Select
objects: prompt of a command by entering su at the command prompt and pressing
Enter, or you can hold down the Ctrl key when selecting objects. The Ctrl key allows
you to select subobjects before you start a command, similar to using the implied
window or crossing selection methods. In fact, you can hold down Ctrl and use either
the implied window or crossing selection method to select several vertices, edges, or
faces at one time. When a subobject is selected, a special grip is displayed that allows
you to stretch the selected subobject. Although you can select curved and straight
edges on a 3D solid, only straight edges display a grip that allow you to stretch it. Later
in this chapter, you find out about the commands SOLIDEDIT and PRESSPULL, which
both take advantage of selecting subobjects to modify a 3D solid. 
Exercise 9-3: Selecting Subobjects on a 3D Solid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-3.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice using subob-
ject selection methods to modify a 3D solid.
1. Turn on Polar Tracking, Snap, and Dynamic Input. Turn off Object Snap.
To on turn Polar Tracking, click POLAR on the status bar until the message
<Polar on> is displayed in the command line window and the POLAR button
appears depressed. To turn on Snap, click SNAP on the status bar until the mes-
sage <Snap off> is displayed in the Command Line window and the OSNAP
button appears depressed. To turn off object snap, click OSNAP on the status bar
until the message <Osnap off> is displayed in the Command Line window and
the OSNAP button appears popped out.

Chapter 9: Modifying and Analyzing Solids

Working with the history of a 3D solid
As you modify 3D solids, AutoCAD is busy taking notes in the background that you might
not even know are there. AutoCAD is creating a running history of the objects that are
used to create complex 3D solids when using the commands UNION, SUBTRACT, 
INTERSECT, PRESSPULL, FILLET, and CHAMFER. (I talk about the UNION, SUBTRACT, 
and INTERSECT commands in Chapter 8, and I cover the commands PRESSPULL, FILLET,
and CHAMFER later in this chapter.)
A 3D solid’s history comes in handy when you need to modify the 3D solid. For exam-
ple, if you subtracted a cylinder from a 3D solid to create a hole and later find out that
it’s in the wrong location and/or is the wrong size, you can use the history to change
the size of the cylinder or its location. If you change the cylinder, the 3D solid that you
subtracted the cylinder from is updated automatically without your having to first add
to the solid and then subtract the new cylinder again.
The SOLIDEDIT command (covered later in this chapter) doesn’t take advantage of
using the history feature. Be careful with which commands you use and in which order
you use them if you want to use the history of a 3D solid later to make edits to the orig-
inal objects.
AutoCAD records the history for any new 3D solids, but you might want to turn 
on the feature for any 3D solids that were created in a previous release or that the fea-
ture was disabled for. The History property under the Solid History category of the
Properties palette allows you to control whether the history is retained when modify-
ing a 3D solid. When the History property is set to Record for a 3D solid, the 3D solids
are retained with the object to allow you to later modify the original objects.
If you set the value for the History property to None, the previously recorded history
is erased, and no new history is created. The BREP command removes the recorded
history from a 3D solid and sets its History property to None. If you don’t want the his-
tory for any of the 3D solids to be retained, use the system variable SOLIDHIST. When
SOLIDHIST is set to the value 0 (zero), no history is retained for any 3D solids in the
drawing window even if the History property for a 3D solid is set to Record. To change
the value of the SOLIDHIST system variable, enter solidhist at the command prompt
and then enter 0 (zero) at the Enter new value for SOLIDHIST <1>: prompt.
The history that’s retained for a 3D solid isn’t displayed in the drawing window. To dis-
play the history of a 3D solid, either set the Show History property to Yes before modi-
fying a 3D solid or set the system variable SHOWHIST to a value of 2. Figure 9-8 shows
a 3D solid with its history displayed on the left and without its history displayed on
the right.

Exercise 9-4: Stepping Back in Time to Modify a 3D Solid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-4.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice using the his-
tory of a complex 3D solid to edit the original box and cylinder used to create the
solid.
1. Select the box and display the Properties palette.
To display the Properties palette, choose Tools➪Palettes➪Properties.
2. On the Properties palette under the Solid History category, select the History
field and select Record from the drop-down list.
3. Union the box and cylinder together.
To union the two objects to create a single 3D solid, choose Modify➪
Solid Editing➪Union. When the Select objects: prompt is displayed, select
the two objects and press Enter.
4. Select the 3D solid to verify the two objects are unioned together and press Esc
to deselect the 3D solid.
5. At the command prompt, enter showhist and press Enter.
6. At the prompt Enter new value for SHOWHIST <1>: enter 2 and press Enter.
The part of the cylinder that extended into the box is now displayed. This is the
part of the cylinder that was removed when the two were unioned together.
7. Hold down Ctrl and select the cylinder.
As the crosshairs pass over the cylinder with Ctrl held down, only the cylinder is
highlighted. The grips for the cylinder are displayed so you can now modify the
cylinder as needed.
8. Press Esc to clear the grips for the cylinder.
9. Select the 3D solid again and set the History property for the 3D solid to None
with the Properties palette.
The part of the cylinder that was removed during the unioning operation disap-
pears when the history is removed.
10. Hold down Ctrl and try to select the cylinder again.
This time you can select only the edges and faces of the cylinder and not the origi-
nal cylinder 3D primitive because the history has been removed from the 3D solid.
11. Save the drawing with the name Completed9-4.dwg to the Chapter 9 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Filleting and chamfering
Fillets (not filets) and chamfers are common features in mechanical designs for parts
such as brackets and fasteners. The FILLET and CHAMFER commands pull double duty
in AutoCAD as they allow you to modify both 2D geometry and 3D solids. The process
of using the FILLET and CHAMFER commands on 3D solids is slightly different from
modifying 2D geometry, but the end result is the same. 
171
Chapter 9: Modifying and Analyzing Solids

With the FILLET command, you can create radius transitions from one face to the next or
to add curved corners on a part. You start the FILLET command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪Fillet.
 Click Fillet either on the Modify toolbar or on the 2D Draw panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter fillet at the command prompt.
The CHAMFER command allows you to create a bevel or angled transition between
two faces based on two distance values. You start the CHAMFER command in the fol-
lowing ways:
 Choose Modify➪Chamfer.
 Click Chamfer either on the Modify toolbar or on the 2D Draw panel on the
Dashboard.
 Enter chamfer at the command prompt.
You might use the CHAMFER command to create a taper in a hole so a screw sits flush
with the bracket or to add a bevel to the side of a plate. Figure 9-9 shows a plate with
curved corners, a radius transition, and a beveled edge. 
Exercise 9-5: Adding Fillets and Chamfers
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-5.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating fillets
and chamfers on a 3D solid.
1. Choose Modify➪Fillet.
2. At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/
Multiple]: prompt, select the vertical edge in the lower-left corner of the box,
indicated by the arrow in Figure 9-10.
3. At the Enter fillet radius <1.0000>: prompt, enter 7.65 and press Enter
twice.
A fillet is added, and it matches the other corners of the mount plate.
4. Press Enter to repeat the FILLET command.
5. At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/
Multiple]: prompt, select the bottom edge of the cylinder.

Slicing and dicing 3D solids
Although AutoCAD doesn’t make a good food processor, it does have the ability to
slice a 3D solid along a specified plane. The SLICE command carves up a 3D solid along
a given plane using a planar object, surface, or three points in addition to a few other
options. (I cover planar objects and surfaces in Chapter 13.) When you slice a 3D solid,
AutoCAD creates two new solids. From the two solids that are created, you can either
choose to keep both halves or keep one of the two new solids that are created.

Slicing a 3D solid allows you to get a better look at the inside of the model for creating
a diagram of how the model is assembled with multiple different parts, to create new
contours on a 3D solid, to create a section cut view when plotting a hardcopy of the
model, or to create a view of the model. The latter is usually done through the use of
other features in AutoCAD like live sectioning or flattening. I talk about live sectioning
and flattening in Chapter 10. Figure 9-11 shows a 3D solid sliced diagonally to show dif-
ferent features. 
You start the SLICE command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪3D Operations➪Slice.
 Click Slice on the 3D Make panel of the Dashboard.
 Enter slice at the command prompt.

Solid editing
The SOLIDEDIT command gives you the capability to modify the faces or edges of a 3D
solid in many different ways, along with editing the entire 3D solid known as the body.
The SOLIDEDIT command offers 16 different ways to modify a 3D solid; some of the
options are much more useful than others. 
You start the SOLIDEDIT command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪Solid Editing and select one of the options from the submenu.
 Click one of the buttons on the Solid Editing toolbar.
 Enter solidedit at the command prompt.
Table 9-1 lists the options of the SOLIDEDIT command that modify the faces of a 3D
solid, and Table 9-2 lists the edge editing options. Table 9-3 lists the 3D solid editing
options that apply to the entire body of the 3D solid.

Description
Imprint
Imprints a 2D or 3D object onto a 3D solid, resulting in
the creation of new faces and edges based on the
object that is imprinted onto the 3D solid. The object
that you want to imprint onto the 3D solid must intersect
one of the faces of the 3D solid. After the object is
imprinted onto the 3D solid, you can extrude the newly
created face to create a new feature like a raised edge
or to inset in the face that the imprinted object is on.
You can also use the IMPRINT command to perform this
task, which I cover in the section “Branding (imprinting)
your 3D solids,” later in this chapter.
Separate Solids
Creates new 3D solids based on each disjointed
volume; the option doesn’t support the separation of 
3D solids that have been modified using Boolean 
operations.
Shell
Hollows out a 3D solid based on an offset distance. A
positive value creates the wall thickness towards the
middle of the 3D solid, whereas a negative value cre-
ates the wall thickness to the outside of the 3D solid.
Clean
Scans a 3D solid for any redundant edges, vertices, and
unused geometry and then removes them.
Check
Validates a 3D solid using the ShapeManager to deter-
mine that it’s a valid object with no problems.

Branding (imprinting) your 3D solids
You can imprint a 3D solid with a 2D object to create new edges and faces. One pur-
pose of imprinting a 2D object onto a 3D solid is so you can add a different material to
the face of a 3D solid. You can also imprint a 2D object onto a 3D solid and then use
the Extrude option of the SOLIDEDIT command or the PRESSPULL command (covered
later in this chapter) to create a feature like an inset or a hole.
The IMPRINT command imprints a 2D object onto a 3D solid and is just like the
Imprint option of the SOLIDEDIT command with the exception that it takes fewer
steps to access and use. As with the Imprint option of the SOLIDEDIT command, the
2D object that you want to imprint must intersect a face of the 3D solid. You can use
the Dynamic UCS feature to make sure that the 2D object that you want to imprint is
drawn right on the face of the 3D solid. (I cover using the Dynamic UCS feature in
Chapter 4.) Figure 9-15 shows part of the bottom of a mounting plate drawn with a 2D
polyline and imprinted onto a 3D solid.
You can start the IMPRINT command in the following ways:
 Choose Modify➪Solid Editing➪Imprint Edges.
 Click Imprint on the Solid Editing toolbar or 3D Make panel on the Dashboard.
 Enter imprint at the command prompt.
Exercise 9-10: Imprinting a 2D Object onto a 3D Solid 
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-10.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder

2. At the Select a 3D solid: prompt, select the outside edge of the 3D solid.
3. At the Select an object to imprint: prompt, select the 2D polyline
toward the middle of the 3D solid.
4. At the Delete the source object [Yes/No] <N>: prompt, enter Y and
press Enter to remove the 2D polyline from the drawing after it is imprinted on
the 3D solid.
5. Press Enter to exit the IMPRINT command.

You don’t have to get pushy
The PRESSPULL command was first introduced in AutoCAD 2007 and allows you to
skip several steps in the process of editing solids. PRESSPULL combines the work of
imprinting and extruding in one step; you can even use the PRESSPULL command to
extrude closed boundaries that aren’t even on the face of a 3D solid to create a new 
3D solid object. Like the command’s name suggests, you can create a 3D solid by
pulling it out of a closed boundary, or you can press it into a 3D solid in order to per-
form a subtraction. PRESSPULL gives you a lot of flexibility in creating conceptual
models. Figure 9-16 shows the results of pressing a 2D polyline that has been drawn
onto a 3D solid to subtract part of the geometry.
You start the PRESSPULL command in the following ways:
 Click Presspull either on the Modeling toolbar or on the 3D Make panel on the
Dashboard.
 Hold down Ctrl+Alt and click inside a closed boundary.
 Enter presspull at the command prompt.
Exercise 9-11: Modifying a 3D Solid with PRESSPULL
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise9-11.dwg from the Chapter 9 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice pressing a
closed boundary into a 3D solid.
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active.
2. Press and hold Ctrl and Alt.
3. Move the crosshairs over the 3D solid and click just to the left of the large hole
while still pressing Ctrl and Alt.

ing in a subtraction.
5. Save the drawing with the name Completed9-11.dwg to the Chapter 9 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Exploding solids
3D solids can be exploded like many other types of complex objects in AutoCAD:
Simply use the EXPLODE command (Modify➪Explode). When you explode 3D solids,
they’re broken down into surfaces and regions. If the face of a 3D solid is flat, it’s most
likely converted into a region, whereas a face that has height and is curved is created
into a surface. For example, if you explode a cylinder, three new objects are created.
Two regions are created for the top and bottom of the cylinder, and a surface is cre-
ated for the side of the cylinder.
Visually, the new objects look very similar when viewed with a visual style other than
2D wireframe or 3D wireframe. Figure 9-17 shows a primitive 3D solid of a cylinder on
the left, but on the right the same 3D solid has been exploded. It’s best not to exploded
a 3D solid because you lose a lot of flexibility in editing the object. 
Putting Your Model under the Microscope
3D models are great for communicating concepts and the intent of a design, but you
can leverage the information contained in the 3D solids of your model for other pur-
poses. AutoCAD provides a few tools to help you collect information about the 3D
model in order to help make sure that your designs are safe. However, to get the most
design analysis data from your model, you have to obtain an additional software pack-
age or two based on the types of parts that you model.
Getting information from your model
You can use the LIST and MASSPROP commands to get some basic information about
3D solids, such as volume and centroid. The LIST command is rather limited in provid-
ing information for 3D solids, except when it comes to primitives. The LIST command
displays the length, width, radius, and height among other values of a selected primi-
tive 3D solid. The MASSPROP command displays information that’s a little more usable
when working with 3D solids, such as moments of inertia, centroid, mass, and several
other values. I cover the MASSPROP command in Chapter 6.
Figure 9-17:
Exploding a
3D solid.

Chapter 9: Modifying and Analyzing Solids

Analyzing your model
2D drawings are great for communicating your designs to the shop floor, but they
don’t allow you to perform complex design and engineering analysis on them. When
you create a 3D model, you can perform different design and engineering analysis on
the model by using additional software. Because AutoCAD is a CAD application that
doesn’t have a specific target industry, it lacks some tools that might be useful in cre-
ating mechanical designs. Similarly, AutoCAD doesn’t offer any types of tools for
design analysis other than the LIST and MASSPROP commands, which are rather lim-
ited in the type of information they offer. Applications such as Autodesk Inventor do a
much better job at both modeling and design analysis in one product, and that’s
because Inventor is designed specifically for mechanical designs. To find out more
about Autodesk Inventor, visit the Inventor product page on the Autodesk Web site at
www.autodesk.com/inventor.
Because AutoCAD doesn’t provide any real design analysis tools out of the box, you
have to rely on other companies for this type of software. The software that you might
use varies based on the parts that you plan on modeling and manufacturing. The type
of analysis you can perform can vary from stress and fatigue analysis using Finite
Element Modeling and Analysis (FEM/FEA) to software that exams how metal or plastic
flows to produce an optimized casting or molded part. Other types of software simu-
late how a part moves or how a complete factory would work. The following is a brief
listing of Web sites that have products that can help you analyzing your models if you
need to do that as part of your design process.
 Moldflow Corporation (www.moldflow.com) has a number of widely used soft-
ware tools for the injection molding industry that addresses the process from
design through to manufacture.
 EKK, Inc., (www.ekkinc.com) offers CAPCAST for metal casting simulation and
analysis.
 Algor (www.algor.com) produces a wide range of FEA software.
 Nastran (www.nenastran.com) produces a wide range of FEA software.
To find out about other tools that you might want to use in analyzing your models,
check with your local design software reseller, surf the Internet using your favorite
search engine, or check out a trade show that’s specific to your industry.

In This Chapter

C
hapter 8 tells you all about primitive and complex 3D solids and how to create them.
You also practice some basic and advanced modifying techniques on 3D solids in
Chapter 9, which include adding to and subtracting from 3D solids and even checking to see
whether two or more 3D solids interfere with each other and other techniques. As you go
through this chapter, you create section and auxiliary views from your 3D models. The sec-
tion and auxiliary views allow you to focus on creating your 3D model first and then create
standard 2D views to create 2D drawings that explain how a part needs to be manufactured.
The exercises in this chapter show you how to bring a 3D model down to 2D objects to help
communicate the final design to those in manufacturing who will be tooling the parts and
assembling them.
Creating Section and Auxiliary Views
Creating section and auxiliary views from a 3D model can help you better communicate how
the model is assembled or even update 2D drawings to ensure they’re accurate before manu-
facturing begins on the parts. Starting with a 2D drawing is common when creating mechani-
cal parts, but when creating 3D models, you might find parts don’t align correctly and might
require some changes. After you create a 3D model of a part, you can create a 2D view from it
that you can use to create or update a set of 2D drawings. AutoCAD comes with different
commands that generate 2D representations of a 3D model, and I cover these commands in
the following sections.
Ready, set, section
In Chapter 9, I cover the SLICE command, which allows you to cut a 3D solid into two halves
along a plane. After you slice a 3D solid along a plane, you can see inside the 3D solid, which
helps in designing the part and can give you a better understanding how everything might 
go together. The downside of the SLICE command is that it modifies a 3D solid. Fortunately,
AutoCAD provides two other commands that allow you to create a 2D or 3D representation of
a 3D solid without actually modifying the 3D solid: SECTIONPLANE and LIVESECTION.

A section plane object determines what part of a 3D model is displayed, similar to how
you can slice a 3D model along a plane. You create a section plane object in the follow-
ing ways:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Section Plane.
 Click Section Plane on the 3D Make control panel of the Dashboard.
 Enter sectionplane at the command prompt.
When you create a section plane object, you can define it by picking two or more points
in the drawing, or you can align the section plane orthogonally to the current UCS. 
After you create a section plane object in a drawing, you can enable what is known as
live sectioning. Live sectioning is a property of a section plane object that allows you to
interactively cut through a 3D model as if you used the SLICE command without actu-
ally affecting the 3D model. More than one section plane object can existing in a draw-
ing at a time, but only one section plane can have live sectioning enabled in the
drawing at a time. Figure 10-1 shows live sectioning enabled on a section plane drawn
through a 3D model.
You activate live sectioning in the following ways:
 Select a section plane object and right-click. From the shortcut menu, choose
Activate Live Sectioning.
 Double-click a section plane object.
 Set the Live Section property in the Properties palette to Yes.
 Select a section plane object and right-click. From the shortcut menu, choose
Live Section Settings and then select Activate Live Section.
 Enter livesection at the command prompt and select a section plane object.
You’re able to see part of the 3D model on-screen, but the object itself isn’t modified in
the same way as using the SLICE command. If you want to, you can choose to see both
halves of the 3D model and not just half of the model. Select the section plane with live
sectioning enabled and right-click. From the right-click menu, choose Show Cut-Away
Geometry. The geometry that’s on the opposite side and not normally displayed is
shown in red. 
You can also adjust the section plane in real time and see the section update. You use
grips on the section plane object to control the position and direction of the section
plane object. Figure 10-2 shows the grips of a section plane object and what they’re
used for. Section planes are defined by two or more points to create jogs for a section
view if needed. To add a jog to a section plane object, select the section plane and
right-click. From the right-click menu, choose Add Jog to Section. Then select the sec-
tion plane and adjust the jog with the grips that are displayed. 
Figure 10-1:
Live sec-
tioning is

186
Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 

After defining a section plane object, you can create a block made up of 2D objects
based on how the section plane cuts through the 3D model or a new 3D object. To
create a 2D or 3D representation of the section view, you need to select the section
plane object and right-click. From the right-click menu, choose Generate 2D/3D Section
to display the Generate Section/Elevation dialog box (see Figure 10-3). The Generate
Section/Elevation dialog box allows you to specify the type of output, the geometry in
the drawing, and the destination of the output. After you’ve specified the desired set-
tings, click the Create button and follow any additional prompts to insert the new
block if needed. 
If you want additional control over how the section view looks, click the Section
Settings button at the bottom of the Generate Section/Elevation dialog box to display
the Section Settings dialog box (see Figure 10-4). From the Section Settings dialog box,
you can specify the layer, color, linetype, and other settings used to generate the 2D or
3D section view. The dialog box has several different categories of properties that you

Viewing, drawing, and profiling solids
The SOLVIEW command creates floating viewports based on projected views of 3D
solids. (I cover layouts and floating viewports in Chapter 20.) You can create floating
viewports that display 3D solids in orthographic, auxiliary, and section views. After a
viewport is created you can use the SOLDRAW command to convert the 3D solids in
the viewport to 2D representations of the current view in the floating viewport. The
SOLDRAW command is limited to floating viewports on layout tabs that are created
with the SOLVIEW command.
When using the SOLDRAW command, AutoCAD creates some new layers on the fly that
place hidden and visible lines and hatch objects. The layers that are created are pre-
fixed with the name of the view that you specify when creating the floating viewport
with the SOLVIEW command, and they’re suffixed with -HID, -VIS, or -HAT. If the
floating viewport represents a section view, the SOLDRAW command hatches any of
the geometry that was cut through to create the view. The scale, angle, and hatch pat-
tern name for the hatch object are based on the system variables HPSCALE, HPANG,
and HPNAME. Figure 10-7 shows a floating viewport created with the SOLVIEW com-
mand, and then a 2D representation was created using the SOLDRAW command.

How can you activate a layout tab?
A.
Click one of the layout tabs at the bottom of the drawing window.
B.
Press Ctrl+Page Up or Ctrl+Page Down to switch between the layout tabs and Model tab in
the drawing.
C.
Click the Layout or Additional Layouts button on the status bar.
D.
Enter model at the command prompt.
The SOLPROF command creates profiles of 3D solids in a floating viewport. It creates
layers on the fly like the SOLDRAW command does, but instead of using the name of
the view for part of the naming convention of the layers that are created, the names
of the layers are based on the handle of the viewport that the profiling of the 3D
solids is being done in. The lines that represent visible edges are placed on layers
that are prefixed with PV-, and hidden lines are placed on layers that are prefixed
with PH-. The SOLPROF command is similar to the FLATSHOT command, which I
cover later in this chapter, but you can use the FLATSHOT commandin Model space.
To start the SOLVIEW, SOLDRAW, and SOLPROF commands, choose Draw➪
Modeling➪Setup and click the appropriate option or enter solview, soldraw, or 
solprof at the command prompt.

Chapter 10: Creating Section and Auxiliary Views from Models

Flattening a Model
You spend lot of time working on a 3D model to make it accurate, so you want to get as
much use out of it as possible. One of the best uses for a 3D model is to create 2D rep-
resentations of different views to share with vendors. I can think of a number of rea-
sons that you might want to take a 3D model and generate 2D objects from them. For
instance, 2D drawings help you protect your intellectual property, they’re used on the
shop floor for manufacturing parts, and you can use them to create exploded views of
a model that can be used in an assembly guide created in a program like Corel Draw.
The FLATSHOT command allows you to create a flattened 2D representation of a 3D
solid known as a profile. A profile of a 3D solid shows a 2D representation of a 3D solid
by showing both visible and hidden edges as lines. (The FLATSHOT command is simi-
lar to the SOLPROF command, which I cover earlier in this chapter.) Unlike most com-
mands in AutoCAD, the FLATSHOT command doesn’t prompt you to select any objects
from the drawing and uses all the 3D solids in Model space. 
To start the FLATSHOT command, click Flatshot on the 3D Make control panel on the
Dashboard or enter flatshot at the command prompt. The Flatshot dialog box (see
Figure 10-11) opens. In the Flatshot dialog box, you can determine how the flattened
view of the 3D solids is created; you can create a block in the current drawing or
create a new drawing file of the flattened view.
You can specify the color and linetypes that are used for both the foreground and
obscured lines. You would see the foreground lines when viewing the 3D solid with the
3D Hidden visual style, and the obscured lines are typically hidden. Examples of
obscure lines might be from an inset, holes through the 3D solid, or any other back
lines that might be hidden otherwise from the current viewing angle. When a flattened
view is created with the FLATSHOT command, no new layers are automatically created
on the fly like they are with the SOLPROF command for both visible and hidden lines.
Figure 10-12 shows a 2D representation of a flattened view of a 3D solid from the top.
The block that gets inserted is placed on the current UCS. If you want the block to be
inserted so it appears in the current view, you want to set the UCS to match the view. I
cover working with the UCS in Chapter 5.

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 

AutoCAD ships with a set of additional utilities called Express Tools. One of these tools
is called Flatten, and it does exactly what its name implies. The FLATTEN command
(Express➪Modify➪Flatten Objects) converts 3D objects to 2D objects. Unlike with the
FLATSHOT command, you can select which objects you want to flatten but the objects
you select are removed from the drawing at the same time. To find out more about the
FLATTEN command, choose Express➪Help to open the online help system that comes
with the Express Tools.
Exercise 10-5: Flattening a 3D Solid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise10-5.dwg from the Chapter 10
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating

Additional Exercises: 
Modeling with Solids
In This Chapter
 Reinforcing concepts by creating models with 3D solids
 Reinforcing concepts used for modifying 3D solids
T
he previous chapters of Part III tell you about creating and modifying 3D solids to create
3D models in AutoCAD. The 3D solids that you create range from primitives in the forms
of boxes, spheres, cones, and others. In those chapters, you also create complex 3D solids
using techniques such as lofting and sweeping. The exercises in this chapter are a continua-
tion of the exercises in Chapter 7. Figure 11-1 shows the rear assembly of the custom motor-
cycle that you work with in this chapter.

Modeling with Primitive and Complex 3D Solids
In this series of exercises, you finish a 3D part that you link to the rear assembly of the
custom motorcycle. The 3D part is a shock that’s a purchased part and not a part that will be
manufactured. When working with purchased parts in your models, you often don’t start
with 2D drawings that you create because you won’t be manufacturing the parts yourself. In
these cases, you must obtain a physical part and take measurements from it to create a 3D
part for use in your models.
Figure 11-1:

Exercise 11-1: Creating 3D Primitives of the Solid Kind
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise11-1.dwg from the Chapter 11
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
primitive 3D solids to finish part of the 3D model of the shock.
1. Set the layer Shock current.
2. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Cone.
3. When prompted to specify the center point of the base for the cone, use the
Node object snap and select the point indicated by the arrow in Figure 11-2.
Model courtesy of Mark Hechel of MasterGraphics, Inc.
4. Enter 1.2 for the base radius and press Enter.
5. At the Specify height or [2Point/Axis endpoint/Top radius]
<15.0949>: prompt, enter T and press Enter.
6. Enter 0.75 for the top radius and press Enter.
7. Enter 1.27 for the height and press Enter.
8. Select the cone that you just created and set its color to 45.
Changing the color of an object directly usually isn’t a good drafting practice, but
it’s an effective way to add color to 3D solids for visualization purposes without
making the layering scheme overly complex.
To set the cone’s color, select the cone and right-click. From the right-click menu,
choose Properties. On the Properties palette, choose Select Color from the Color
property’s drop-down list to display the Select Color dialog box. In the Select
Color dialog box, click the Index Color tab and select the color 45 swatch or
enter 45 in the Color text box. When done, click OK.
9. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Cylinder.
10. When prompted to specify the center point of the base for the cylinder, use the
Center object snap and select the center point at the top of the cone that you
just created.
11. Enter 0.31 for the base radius and press Enter.
12. Enter 2.56 for the height and press Enter.
13. Select the cylinder that you just created and set its color to 219,219,219 using the
True Color tab of the Select Color dialog box. 
Figure 11-2:

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling 

To set the cylinder’s color, select the cylinder and right-click. From the right-click
menu, choose Properties. On the Properties palette, choose Select Color from
the Color property’s drop-down list to display the Select Color dialog box. In the
Select Color dialog box, click the True Color tab and select 219,219,219 in the
color palette. Or simply type the value in the Color text box at the bottom. When
you’re done, click OK.
14. Start the CYLINDER command again.
15. When prompted to specify the center point of the base for the cylinder, use the
Center object snap and select the top of the cylinder that you just created.
16. Enter 1.25 for the base radius and press Enter.
17. Enter 3.78 for the height and press Enter.
Now the model looks like the one in Figure 11-3. However, it isn’t quite done 
yet — see the following exercise.

18. Save the drawing with the name Completed11-1.dwg to the Chapter 11 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Exercise 11-2: Sweeping a 2D Profile to Create a Complex 3D Solid
In this exercise, you practice creating the spring for the shock through sweeping a
circle for the diameter of the spring along a 2D path. The 2D path in this exercise is a
3D polyline instead of a helix because it needed to be compressed at both the top and
bottom of the spring.
1. Open the drawing Exercise11-2a.dwg from the Chapter 11 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
2. Turn on the layer 3DConst_spring.
The drawing looks like the one in Figure 11-4, with a path and a circle shown.
3. Set the layer Shock_spring current.
4. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Sweep.
5. When prompted for the object to sweep, select the circle indicated by 1 in 
Figure 11-4 and press Enter.
6. When prompted for the path, select the 3D polyline indicated by 2.
7. To get a better look at the new 3D solid that you just created, choose View➪

Modifying a 3D Solid
In this series of exercises, you modify the 3D part (the transfer link) that you created
in Exercise 8-3. You create insets on the part and add some fillets to finish the design of
the part. After modifying the 3D model of the transfer link, you open the rear assembly
of the custom motorcycle to see the changes live in the model assembly. Because the
transfer link model was originally referenced and not inserted into the drawing with
the rear assembly, the changes show up automatically with minimal work.

Exercise 11-4: Adding Fillets to a 3D Solid
In this exercise, you practice adding fillets to the 3D model of the transfer link to com-
plete the part based on the original 2D drawing from Exercise 8-3.
1. Open the drawing RearAssembly.dwg from the Chapter 11 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
The transfer link doesn’t contain any of the insets or fillets that you created 
in Exercise 11-3. The reason for this is that the file Transfer_link.dwg
is linked into the drawing and not Exercise11-3.dwg. You update the
Transfer_link.dwg file near the end of this exercise to see the changes to 
the part in the assembly.
2. Close the drawing RearAssembly.dwg without saving any changes made to it.
3. Open the drawing Exercise11-4.dwg from the Chapter 11 folder in the My
Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.
4. Choose Modify➪Fillet.
5. When prompted to select the first object, pick the edge indicated by 1 in 
Figure 11-10.

Part III: 3D Modeling — Solid Modeling

3D Modeling — Surfaces

In this part . . .

D solids aren’t the only objects that you can use to
create 3D models in AutoCAD. AutoCAD offers the
ability to create surface models using faces, meshes, and
surface objects. Based on the object you’re modeling, you
likely use a combination of faces, meshes, and surface
objects. Surface models aren’t as accurate as 3D solids
because they’re created from objects that don’t support
true curved objects. Instead curved edges on a surface
model are created by controlling the density of the
straight edges of a mesh to give the model a smooth look.

n this chapter, you take a look at surface modeling, which is much different from model-
ing with solids. Surface models don’t offer as much flexibility in the area of editing as 3D
solids do, but in some situations, you’ll need to use surfaces. For example, you need a sur-
face model for a plane below a 3D model to receive shadows that are cast for added realism,
or it can be an open object that doesn’t need any thickness. The exercises in this chapter
show you how to create 3D faces, 3D mesh primitives, and planar surfaces.
Working with Surfaces
You can use surfaces in place of 3D solids when creating 3D models, but they take some
upfront planning to make sure that you don’t spend a lot of time editing them. Like 3D solids,
surfaces create a virtual representation of an object that you plan on manufacturing or build-
ing in the physical world.
Surface models in AutoCAD are made up of three different object types: faces, meshes, and
surface objects:
 Faces are the most basic object type that you can create a surface model from. A face
is made up of either three or four sides and can hide objects beyond the face.
 A mesh is simply a combination of multiple faces that are arranged to create a single
object that can represent an object like a box or sphere. 
 A surface object can be flat or created through an operation such as extruding or loft-
ing. Surface objects are much more complex in nature than a mesh is and aren’t just
made up of a series of points. AutoCAD allows you to create surface models through
primitives and complex objects just like 3D solids.
Because meshes are created from a series of faces and not curved elements, they aren’t
nearly as visually accurate as a 3D solid is. So why use curved mesh objects if they aren’t
really curved objects? Over a decade ago, computers weren’t as powerful as they are today,
and it took a lot of computing power and storage space to use 3D solids. So companies
resorted to using surface models to help their clients visualize what the end product would
look like. 2D drawings were the main way to communicate designs and develop products, but
times have changed. These days, storage and processing power are relatively cheap, which
allows for the use of 3D solids for creating conceptual designs and accurate models. 

Other software packages you might work with might not handle 3D solids very well, so
you might have to use surfaces instead. So it really depends on what you can use in
your drafting environment; if the model needs to be lightweight and portable, you
might have to use surfaces.
Autodesk is placing more emphasis on using 3D solids over surfaces because of the
number of enhancements to 3D solids in recent releases. In fact, most of the surface cre-
ation commands have been removed from the menus, toolbars, or dashboard panels.
To create 3D faces and mesh objects, you can use a few of the remaining commands
that have fortified themselves on the Draw menu. But most of the commands to create
3D mesh objects are now accessible only from the command prompt.
Primitive surfaces
Primitive surfaces are 3D meshes created in the form of basic geometric shapes, and
they’re often used as a starting point for creating a surface model. AutoCAD allows you
to create eight different 3D mesh primitives (see Figure 12-1). Although 3D mesh primi-
tives aren’t quite as defined as their 3D solid counterparts are, they’re categorized into
two distinct groups: straight edges and curves. But 3D meshes really aren’t curved
objects: Like in an optical illusion, the “curved” edges are really made of straight seg-
ments that appear curved from a distance. 
Complex surfaces
AutoCAD allows you to create complex objects made up of either meshes or surface
objects from open or closed 2D objects (also known as profiles) through operations
such as revolving, lofting, or extruding (see Figure 12-2). Some of the same commands
that create complex 3D solids also create complex surface objects. I cover creating
both complex 3D meshes and surface objects in Chapter 13.

Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces 

Controlling the smoothness of a surface
The current values of FACETRES and VIEWRES affect how models created with 3D
solids appear in the drawing window. How surface models are displayed in the drawing
window is somewhat more complicated based on the object types. 3D faces and
meshes always look the same no matter what the current values of FACETRES and
VIEWRES are, but the same doesn’t hold true for surface objects. Surface objects are
affected by the current value of VIEWRES just like arcs, circles, and curved faces on 3D
solids. A low zoom percentage for VIEWRES causes curved surface objects to appear
blocky. 
The system variables SURFU and SURFV affect the number of isolines that appear on
new surface objects that you create for your models. You can change the SURFU and
SURFV system variables by entering the variable name at the command prompt, or
using the sliders for the U and V isolines under the 3D Objects section on the 3D
Modeling tab of the Options dialog box. Figure 12-3 shows two surface objects created
through lofting with different U and V isoline values.
Another factor that affects how smooth surface models appear is the density in which
you create 3D meshes. 3D meshes — unlike surface objects — are made of straight seg-
ments, so when creating the mesh, you need to know the number of segments that you
want. Unfortunately, if the mesh isn’t smooth enough, you need to re-create it. Some of
the commands that allow you to create 3D meshes prompt you for the number of seg-
ments, but some don’t. If you aren’t prompted for the number of segments, use the
system variables SURFTAB1 and SURFTAB2. The system variables that you need to
change are based on the command that you’re using to create the mesh. Figure 12-4
shows two 3D mesh spheres created with two different segment counts.

Chapter 12: Modeling with Surfaces

Putting the Face in Surface
Faces are elements of a 3D solid, but they’re also objects that create a three- or four-
sided object to make a surface model. As you model with faces to create objects, a
number of faces are stitched together like a patchwork quilt. You can control which
edges of a face are displayed to make it appear as if the adjacent faces create a single
object. Figure 12-5 shows two rectangular objects with a rectangular hole in the center
created using 3D faces. The faces on the left have all their edges visible, whereas the
one on the right has select edges hidden. 
You start the command to create a 3D face by choosing Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪
3D Face or entering 3dface at the command prompt.
To view the invisible edges of a 3D face, enter splframe at the command prompt. When
prompted for a new value, enter 1 to show the edges marked as invisible or 0 to hide
the edges marked as invisible. Then you need to force a regeneration of the drawing by
using the REGEN (View➪Regen) command.

Exercise 12-1: Creating a 3D Face
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-1.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creat-
ing a 3D face.
1. Turn off Dynamic Input.
To turn off Dynamic Input, click the DYN button on the status bar so it appears
popped out.
2. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪3D Face.
3. At the Specify first point or [Invisible]: prompt, enter 0,0,0 and
press Enter.
4. At the Specify second point or [Invisible]: prompt, enter 2,2,2 and
press Enter.
5. At the Specify third point or [Invisible] <exit>: prompt, enter I
and press Enter to draw the edge as invisible.
6. The prompt repeats, and when prompted for the third point enter 2,4,2 and
press Enter to draw the edge as invisible.
7. At the Specify fourth point or [Invisible] <create three-sided
face>: prompt, enter 0,6,0 and press Enter twice to end the command.
Only three lines are displayed, but if you use one of the 3D visual styles like
Conceptual you can see that the face object has been drawn.
8. Start the 3DFACE command again. At the first point prompt, enter I and press
Enter. When the prompt repeats, enter @ and press Enter to pick the last point
that created the previous 3D face object.
9. Enter 2,4,2 and press Enter for the second point.
10. Enter 4,4,2 and press Enter for the third point.
11. Enter 6,6,0 and press Enter twice to complete the face.
The second face is created and the shared edges of the two faces are set as invis-
ible, causing the two faces to look like they form one surface (see Figure 12-6).
12. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-1.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Meshes with Straight Edges
3D mesh objects come in a variety of shapes and sizes. AutoCAD allows you to create a
planar mesh object and three different 3D mesh primitives that are made up of straight
edges. The 3D mesh primitives with straight edges that you can create are very similar
Figure 12-6:
Two faces
drawn to
look like 
a single 
surface.
211
Chapter 12: Modeling with Surfaces

to their 3D solid cousins: box, wedge, and pyramid. 3D planar meshes — although not
primitives — share some features in common with the 3D mesh primitives; so they’re
in this chapter as well.
Planar meshes
Planar meshes are similar to a 3D face except that they’re divided into segments that
run in the M and N directions. The M and N directions are one of the strange things you
have to deal with for 3D objects. The direction might not be in the X or Y directions, so
instead of saying horizontal and vertical, you use M and N. The M direction creates hor-
izontal segments, and the N direction creates vertical segments. Figure 12-7 shows a 3D
planar mesh object created with a mesh size of 4 in the M direction (going from up to
down) and 8 in the N direction (going from left to right). 
You can start creating a 3D mesh by entering 3d at the command prompt and choosing
the Mesh option or entering ai_mesh at the command prompt. When you’ve created
the 3D mesh object, you can use grip editing to manipulate the flow of the mesh. 
Exercise 12-2: Creating a 3D Planar Mesh
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-2.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a 3D mesh.
1. Turn off Dynamic Input.
2. At the command prompt enter 3d and press Enter.
3. At the Enter an option [Box/Cone/DIsh/DOme/Mesh/Pyramid/Sphere/
Torus/Wedge]: prompt, enter M and press Enter to draw a planar mesh object.
4. At the Specify first corner of mesh: prompt, enter 0,0,0 and press Enter.
5. At the Specify second corner of mesh: prompt, enter 3,6,2 and press Enter.
6. At the Specify third corner of mesh: prompt, enter 6,6,2 and press Enter.
7. At the Specify fourth corner of mesh: prompt, enter 6,0,0 and press Enter.
8. At the Enter mesh size in the M direction: prompt, enter 4 and press
Enter.
9. At the Enter mesh size in the N direction: prompt, enter 4 and press
Enter.
10. Set the Conceptual visual style (or another visual style) current.

11. Switch to an isometric view using either one of the orbiting commands or
options from the View➪3D View sub-menu.
12. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-2.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Boxes and wedges
Boxes and wedges are very similar in how they are created. When you create a box or
wedge, you specify its length, width, and height. As you create a box, you have options
to create a cube (all sides are the same length) and the box can be rotated after you
specify its length, width, and height. Figure 12-8 shows some of the different 3D mesh
boxes and wedges that you can create. You might create a box to represent a pedestal
to mount a flange or to create a housing for a fuse box. Wedges are useful when you
want to create an edge of a blade or an inclined/sloped plane.
To start the command to create a 3D mesh primitive of a box or wedge, enter 3d at the
command prompt and choose the Box or Wedge option. Or enter at the command
prompt ai_box for a box or ai_wedge for a wedge.

What option is available when creating a 3D mesh primitive of a box or wedge that is not avail-
able when creating a 3D solid primitive of a box or wedge? 
A.
You can rotate the box or wedge after the dimensions of the primitive have been specified.
B.
There is no difference.
C.
You can create a cube, making all edges the same length.
Exercise 12-3: Creating a 3D Mesh Box or Wedge
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-3.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a 3D mesh box.
1. At the command prompt, enter 3d and press Enter.
2. At the Enter an option [Box/Cone/DIsh/DOme/Mesh/Pyramid/Sphere/
Torus/Wedge]: prompt, enter b and press Enter.
3. At the Specify corner point of box: prompt, pick a point in the middle of
the drawing window.
4. At the Specify length of box: prompt, enter 6 and press Enter.

You can also specify a point on-screen by picking in the drawing window. You
won’t see the creation of the box interactively like you do when using the BOX
command to create a 3D solid of the primitive.
5. At the Specify width of box or [Cube]: prompt, enter 3 and press Enter.
6. At the Specify height of box: prompt, enter 1.5 and press Enter.
Unlike the BOX command, you can rotate the object around the corner point that
you picked initially.
7. At the Specify rotation angle of box about the Z axis or 
[reference]: prompt, enter 0 and press Enter.
You can’t just press Enter and expect the box to not be rotated; AutoCAD uses
the current angle that is being shown in the drawing window to rotate the final
object.
8. Set the Conceptual visual style current or another visual style of your choosing,
and change the viewing angle so you’re looking at the box from the side.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-3.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Pyramid
Pyramids are traditionally objects with four equal sides, but AutoCAD bends the rules a
bit and allows you to create a pyramid with four sides that aren’t necessarily equal in
length. Creating a pyramid also isn’t limited to just four sides; you can create a three-
sided geometric object known as a tetrahedron.
You start the 3D mesh primitive for a pyramid by entering 3d at the command prompt
and choosing the Pyramid option or entering ai_pyramid at the command prompt.
After you define the base of the pyramid, you can specify an apex (peak), ridge or a
top that’s defined with the same number of edges as the base. Figure 12-9 shows some
of the different 3D mesh pyramids that you can create.
Figure 12-9:

Exercise 12-4: Creating a 3D Mesh Pyramid
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-4.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a 3D mesh pyramid.
1. Make sure ortho mode is turned on.
To turn on ortho mode, click the ORTHO button on the status bar so it appears
indented. 
2. At the command prompt enter 3d and press Enter.
3. At the Enter an option [Box/Cone/DIsh/DOme/Mesh/Pyramid/Sphere/
Torus/Wedge]: prompt, enter P and press Enter to draw a pyramid.
4. At the Specify first corner point for base of pyramid: prompt,
enter 0,0,0 and press Enter.
5. At the Specify second corner point for base of pyramid: prompt,
drag the crosshairs to the right. Then enter 4.5 and press Enter.
6. At the Specify third corner point for base of pyramid: prompt,
drag the crosshairs downward. Then enter 2.5 and press Enter.
7. At the Specify fourth corner point for base of pyramid or
[Tetrahedron]: prompt, drag the crosshairs to the left. Then enter 4.5 and
press Enter or enter T to create a three-sided pyramid.
8. At the Specify apex point of pyramid or [Ridge/Top]: prompt, enter
2.25,-1.25,4 and press Enter. Or enter r to create a ridge, which allows you to
create an edge that’s created by the ends of the pyramid coming together into
two points instead of one. Or enter T to create the top of the pyramid with a flat
or sloped face based on how the points are selected.
Before you create a pyramid, you can create point objects that you can snap to
and make it easier to define the ridge or top of the pyramid. The point objects
serve as reference points that you can erase later.
9. Set the Conceptual visual style (or another visual style) current and change the
viewing angle so you’re looking at the pyramid from the side.
10. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-4.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Curvy Meshes
Although 3D meshes are all created from straight edges, some 3D meshes give the
sense of curved edges. Curved meshes don’t appear as smooth as a curved 3D solid
does up close, but from a distance, you can’t tell which one is which. 3D meshes aren’t
used to create accurate models because they look jagged; if jagged-looking edges don’t
work for you, don’t use curved meshes — or at least don’t use them when curves are
involved. Figure 12-10 shows two spheres: one created as a 3D solid and the other as a
3D mesh with the Conceptual visual style current. If you look along the outer edges of
the sphere on the right you can see the jagged edges. To create a smoother-looking
sphere as a 3D mesh, increase its segment count.
Sphere
Spheres (see Figure 12-11) are the three-dimensional counterparts to a circle, but
they’re defined differently because they require additional input. 
You start the 3D mesh sphere by entering 3d at the prompt and choosing the Sphere
option or entering ai_sphere at the command prompt. Then you define the sphere by
specifying a center point, the radius or diameter, and the number of longitudinal and
latitudinal segments to carve the sphere into. The more segments used, the smoother
the 3D mesh appears. Longitudinal segments run from the top to the bottom of the
sphere, and latitudinal segments run around the sphere. Spheres are useful for the ball
in a mouse, the top of a screw, or a handle with a rounded end. Because you create a
sphere based on its center point, half the sphere is created above and below the cur-
rent working plane or the specified point.

Exercise 12-5: Creating a 3D Mesh Sphere
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-5.dwg from the Chapter 12

a 3D mesh sphere.
1. At the command prompt enter 3d and press Enter.
2. At the Enter an option [Box/Cone/DIsh/DOme/Mesh/Pyramid/Sphere/
Torus/Wedge]: prompt, enter S and press Enter to draw a sphere.
3. At the Specify center point of sphere: prompt, pick a point near the
middle of the drawing window.
4. At the Specify radius of sphere or [Diameter]: prompt, enter 3.125
and press Enter or enter D to specify the diameter of the sphere.
5. At the Enter number of longitudinal segments for surface of
sphere <16>: prompt, enter 24 and press Enter.
6. At the Enter number of latitudinal segments for surface of
sphere <16>: prompt, enter 24 and press Enter.
7. Set the Conceptual visual style (or another visual style) current and change the
viewing angle so you’re looking at the sphere from an isometric view.
8. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-5.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Dish and dome
Dishes and domes are essentially the bottom and top halves of a 3D mesh sphere (see
Figure 12-12). You define a dish or dome in the same way that you do a 3D mesh
sphere, except that you specify half as many latitudinal segments because you create
only half a sphere. A dish is created below the working plane or the specified point,
whereas a dome is created above the working plane or specified point. You might use 
a dish for a foot pad on an object that needs to be elevated or a dome as a cap on a
hexagon nut or a screw head.
You start the command to create a 3D mesh primitive of a dish or dome by entering 3d
at the command prompt and choosing the Dish or Dome options. Or enter at the com-
mand prompt ai_dish for a dish or ai_dome for a dome.
Exercise 12-6: Creating a 3D Mesh Dome
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-6.dwg from the Chapter 12

3. At the Specify center point of dish: prompt, pick a point near the
middle of the drawing window.
4. At the Specify radius of dish or [Diameter]: prompt, enter 2.75 and

Cone
Cones are defined with a curved base and can have a top that forms a flat top or peak
(see Figure 12-13). When you define a cone, you can create as many edges as you want
at its base to create an octagon or even a hexagon shape, which allows you to create
many different types of objects quickly. For example, you can define a cone with a top
radius value that matches its base radius to create a three-dimensional bolt head. If
you create a cone with no peak, the top is left open, as well as the bottom. If you want
to close the object, you can draw a series of 3D faces or a mesh object. You also can’t
define a cone in the negative direction, so you would need to use the 3DROTATE com-
mand to flip it upside down if you need to.
Figure 12-13:

To start creating a 3D mesh primitive of a cone, enter 3d at the command prompt and
choose the Cone option or enter ai_cone at the command prompt.
Exercise 12-7: Creating a 3D Mesh Cone
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-7.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents.  Then practice creat-
ing a 3D mesh cone.
1. At the command prompt, enter 3d and press Enter.
2. At the Enter an option [Box/Cone/DIsh/DOme/Mesh/Pyramid/Sphere/
Torus/Wedge]: prompt, enter c and press Enter to draw a cone.
3. At the Specify center point for base of cone: prompt, pick a point
near the middle of the drawing window.
4. At the Specify radius for base of cone or [Diameter]: prompt, enter
4.1675 and press Enter or enter D to specify the diameter of the cone.
5. At the Specify radius for top of cone of [Diameter] <0>: prompt,
press Enter to create a point at the top of the cone.
If you enter a radius greater than 0 (zero), you create a cone with a flat top.
If you create a cone with the same radius for its top and base, you create a cylin-
der. This is the reason why there’s no cylinder option for the 3D command.
However, the object that you create is open on both the top and bottom ends, and
you would have to use 3D faces or another 3D mesh object to close those ends.
6. At the Specify height of cone: prompt, enter 9.675 and press Enter.
7. At the Enter number of segments for surface of cone <16>: prompt,
press Enter to accept the default number of segments.
8. Set the Conceptual visual style (or another visual style) current and change the
viewing angle so you’re looking at the sphere from an isometric view.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-7.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Torus
A torus is a circular, tube-shaped object, like a doughnut, and is one of the least-used
3D mesh primitives that AutoCAD offers (see Figure 12-14). 
To start creating a torus, enter 3d at the command prompt and choose the Torus
option, or enter ai_torus at the command prompt. When you create a torus, half of the
object is created above and half below the current plane or point specified, just like a
sphere is. You define the center of the torus, its outermost radius, the radius of the
tube, and the number of segments around the circumferences of the tube and torus.

Planar Surfaces and Surface Objects
Before you take the world by storm with your new-found surface modeling skills, you
need to know about the surface object. Surface objects are relatively new in AutoCAD;
they were introduced with AutoCAD 2007. Surface objects are commonly created
through techniques such as lofting, extruding, and sweeping open 2D profiles, but you
can also create a planar surface. Surface objects offer some of the functionality that 3D
solids do for editing them, but the editing that you can perform is limited. Surface
objects come into play when you need a plane to slice through 3D solids to make con-
toured faces. Figure 12-15 shows a surface object created with the LOFT command and
a couple of planar surface objects.
Figure 12-15:

Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces 

Planar surface
The planar surface object is a flat object that creates floors or adds a surface below a
model to receive shadows that are being cast from light sources. You can create planar
surfaces in two different ways: 
 Pick two points in a drawing. Figure 12-15 shows a planar surface on the right,
which was defined by picking two points.
 Select a closed 2D object such as a circle, closed polyline, or region. 
When you select an object to create a planar surface from, the DELOBJ system variable
controls what happens to the original object that you select. If you want to keep the
original closed 2D object, you have to set the system variable DELOBJ to 0 (zero)
before selecting the object to create a planar surface from. After you create a planar
surface, it displays lines, which are its isolines, across the surface. You can control the
number of isolines that are displayed by the current values of the system variables
SURFU and SURFV before creating the planar surface, as I mention earlier in this chap-
ter. You can also change the number of isolines displayed by using the Properties
palette after selecting the planar surface object.
You can create a planar surface with any of these methods:
 Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Planar Surface.
 Click Planar Surface on the Modeling toolbar.
 Click Planar Surface on the 3D Make panel of the Dashboard.
 Enter planesurf at the command prompt.
Turn off orthomode when creating a planar surface object. For some reason, the com-
mand that creates the object doesn’t like orthomode.
Exercise 12-9: Creating a Planar Surface
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise12-9.dwg from the Chapter 12
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a planar surface.
1. Make sure ORTHO is turned off before proceeding.
2. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Planar Surface.
3. At the Specify first corner or [Object] <Object>: prompt, enter 0,6
and press Enter.
4. At the Specify other corner: prompt, enter 15,0 and press Enter.
5. Save the drawing with the name Completed12-9.dwg to the Chapter 12 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Complex surface objects
You can create surface objects (other than those created with the PLANESURF com-
mand) using some of the same commands that I introduce in Chapter 8 for creating
complex 3D solids. Creating complex surface objects allows you to create much more
elaborate surface models and can be used as slicing planes with the SLICE command
on 3D solids. I cover creating surface objects with commands like LOFT and REVOLVE
along with a few others in Chapter 13.

S
urface modeling isn’t limited to just creating 3D faces, 3D mesh primitives, and planar
surfaces. Prior to AutoCAD 2007, you could create complex 3D meshes based on pick-
ing a number of vertices to form a mesh, revolve 2D profiles around an axis, create a ruled
mesh between two 2D objects, and a few other methods, which I talk about in this chapter.
Starting with AutoCAD 2007, you could create not only planar surface objects, but complex
surface objects through several different techniques. Some of the techniques that you can
use to create complex surface objects include revolving and extruding open 2D profiles. The
exercises in this chapter show you how to create both complex 3D meshes and surface
objects.
Creating Complex 3D Meshes
Complex 3D meshes allow you to complete a surface model with greater detail than just using
3D faces and mesh primitives. You can create complex 3D meshes through a number of differ-
ent methods using existing 2D geometry that you might already have created in a drawing.
You can create revolved, ruled, and tabulated meshes with existing 2D geometry. Another con-
cept that you can use to create complex objects for a surface model is to create what is known
as an irregular mesh (or nonplanar mesh). 
Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty: The following exercises get a bit meshy.
Irregular-shaped 3D meshes
Irregular meshes blend areas between 3D mesh primitives that don’t quite fit snugly together,
or they can close an open mesh. AutoCAD allows you to create two different types of irregu-
lar meshes: 
 Free-form polygon: This mesh has a number of segments running in the M and N direc-
tions. After you define the number of segments, you specify where each of the vertices
for the mesh is to be placed in the drawing. 
 Polyface: This mesh is like the free-form polygon mesh type in that it’s defined vertex by
vertex, but you don’t need to define the number of segments that the mesh should be
defined with. However, when you create a polyface mesh, you first define a series of ver-
tices and then determine how the vertices are connected to create the mesh. Figure 13-1
shows a free-form polygon mesh on the left and a polyface mesh on the right. All of the
3D mesh primitives that I cover in Chapter 12 are polyface meshes.

Both the free-form polygon mesh and polyface mesh are usually used when customiz-
ing AutoCAD rather than for everyday modeling. Because the two irregular-shaped 3D
meshes are primarily targeted for customizing, they have a learning curve to them.
Many users don’t use them and just create a series of 3D faces between points in a
drawing to create irregular shapes if they need to. 
You can create a free-form polygon mesh by entering 3dmesh at the command prompt.
You can create an irregular polyface mesh by entering pface at the command prompt.
Depending on the desired outcome, it can often be easier to create a planar 3D mesh
object with the Mesh option of the 3D command and then manipulate the vertices of
the mesh as needed to create the irregular 3D mesh that you need.

The bad thing about using the PFACE command is that if you make a mistake you
have to start all over again. Or instead of starting over, you can explode the
mesh and remove the incorrectly drawn faces and refinish the mesh with the
PFACE command or draw individual 3D faces using the 3DFACE command.
19. Save the drawing with the name Completed13-2.dwg to the Chapter 13 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Revolved meshes
Creating a revolved mesh is very similar to creating a revolved 3D solid or surface. (I
cover creating revolved 3D solids in Chapter 8, and I discuss creating revolved sur-
faces later in this chapter.)
To create a revolved mesh, choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Revolved Mesh or enter
refsurf at the command prompt. You need to have an open or closed 2D profile and
know the axis that you want the profile to revolve around. You then specify the start
angle and the number of degrees that the profile should be revolved. You can use 2D
objects such as lines, circles, and arcs to create a revolved mesh, but using a 2D poly-
line is easier because you can only select a single object to revolve. Revolved meshes
are great for representing objects such as pulleys, hubs, and even bolt heads.
When you create a revolved mesh, the system variables SURFTAB1 and SURFTAB2 con-
trols its smoothness: 
 SURFTAB1 controls the number of times the profile is rotated around the speci-
fied axis.
 SURFTAB2 determines the number of segments that the profile should be equally
divided into. The segments are divided perpendicular to the rotation axis. 
To change the value of either SURFTAB1 or SURFTAB2, enter the variable’s name at the
command prompt and then enter the new value. Figure 13-6 shows a 2D polyline before
and after being revolved to create a 3D mesh.

a revolved 3D mesh. 
1. At the command prompt, enter surftab1 and press Enter.
2. At the Enter new value for SURFTAB1 <6>: prompt, enter 16 and press
Enter.

3. Change the value of the system variable SURFTAB2 to 12.
4. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Revolved Mesh.
5. At the Select object to revolve: prompt, select the 2D polyline profile
indicated by the arrow in Figure 13-6.
6. At the Select object that defines the axis of revolution: prompt,
select the line to the right of the 2D polyline profile in Figure 13-6.
7. At the Specify start angle <0>: prompt, press Enter to accept the default
start angle of 0 (zero).
8. At the Specify included angle (+=ccw, -=cw) <360>: prompt, press
Enter to revolve the 2D profile a full 360 around the axis.
The completed revolved mesh looks like the one on the right in Figure 13-6.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed13-3.dwg to the Chapter 13 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Tabulating meshes
Tabulating meshes has nothing to do with counting ballots or elections, but rather cre-
ating a mesh, which is similar to creating an extruded 3D solid. To create a tabulated
mesh, you start with an open or closed 2D profile such as a line, a circle, an arc, or 
a 2D polyline. I recommend using 2D polylines because you can select only a single
profile to create a tabulated mesh from. Then choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪
Tabulated Mesh or enter tabsurf at the command prompt. After you’ve selected the 2D
profile, you select an object to determine the vector in which the object should be
drawn. Unlike the EXTRUDE command, you can’t just specify a height to create the
mesh. A tabulated mesh is great for creating shafts or rails.
When you create a tabulated mesh, the system variable SURFTAB1 controls its smooth-
ness. It controls the number of segments that the 2D profile is equally divided into. To
change the value of SURFTAB1, you enter the variable’s name at the command prompt
and then enter the new value when prompted. Figure 13-7 shows the results of creating
a tabulated 3D mesh from the closed spline.

Exercise 13-4: Creating a Tabulated 3D Mesh
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise13-4.dwg from the Chapter 13
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a tabulated 3D mesh.
1. Change the value of the system variable SURFTAB1 to 24.
You can change the value of a system variable by entering its name at the com-
mand prompt, and then entering the new value. To change the value of the
SURFTAB1 system variable, enter surftab1 at the command prompt and press
Enter. When prompted for the new value, enter the new value and press Enter.
2. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Tabulated Mesh.
3. At the Select object for path curve: prompt, select the 2D spline profile
indicated by the arrow in Figure 13-7.
4. At the Select object for direction vector: prompt, select near the
bottom of the line that is going in the Z direction closest to the spline.
The end of the path that you select controls which direction the tabulated mesh
is created in. The completed tabulated mesh looks like the one on the right in
Figure 13-7.
5. Save the drawing as the name Completed13-4.dwg to the Chapter 13 folder in
the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
One mesh to rule them all
Ruled meshes aren’t subjects to a mesh named King Mesh or anything along those
lines. To get a ruled mesh, you select two 2D profiles (open or closed), and AutoCAD
calculates the segment points that fall on both objects to create a mesh. Usually you
create ruled meshes from curved objects because they’re the hardest to quickly create
a good-looking mesh between. To create a ruled mesh, you can select two 2D profiles
(open or closed) that are on the same or different planes.
Both objects that make up the ruled mesh must be either open or closed; you can’t
use one of each. In addition to using open and closed 2D objects, you can use a point
object in place of one of the 2D objects to have the mesh converge to a single vertex.
You can select only one point object when creating a ruled mesh, but it can be either
the first or second object selected. You can create a ruled mesh for a hole that goes
through a part or an inset. Ruled meshes are good to use instead of tabulated meshes
when you have two different profiles to work with that might be of the same or differ-
ent sizes.

Chapter 13: Complex Surface Modeling

You create a ruled mesh between two 2D objects by choosing Draw➪Modeling➪
Meshes➪Ruled Mesh or entering rulesurf at the command prompt. The system vari-
able SURFTAB1 controls its smoothness. The system variable SURFTAB1 controls the
number of segments that each of the two 2D profiles is equally divided into. To change
the value of SURFTAB1, enter the variable’s name at the command prompt and then
enter the new value. Figure 13-8 shows the results of creating a ruled 3D mesh from the
two 2D objects.
Exercise 13-5: Creating a Ruled 3D Mesh
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise13-5.dwg from the Chapter 13
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a ruled 3D mesh.
1. Copy the arc in the drawing up 6 units in the Z direction.
2. Change the value of the system variable SURFTAB1 to 8.
3. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Ruled Mesh.
4. At the Select first defining curve: prompt, select near the end point of
the arc of the bottom on the right side.
5. At the Select second defining curve: prompt, select near the end point of
the arc of the top on the right side.

6. Save the drawing with the name Completed13-5.dwg to the Chapter 13 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Edgy meshes
You can create meshes based on four adjoining edges that form a closed object.
Creating meshes based on four edges allows you to make more organic-looking
objects, such as fabrics or liquids that are in a container. You can also create meshes
between four edges to help finish off part of a surface model that might need to be
capped or to blend other faces together. The four objects that you select to create the
mesh must start or end at the end point of the adjoining edge, and they must be a line,
an arc, a spline, or a polyline. The first object that you select determines the M direc-
tion of the mesh, and the adjoining edges that touch the endpoints of the first object
determine the N direction. 
To start a mesh patch between four adjoining edges, choose Draw➪Modeling➪
Meshes➪Edge Mesh or enter edgesurf at the command prompt.
Figure 13-8:
A ruled 3D

Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces 

The number of segments that run in the M and N directions determines how smooth
the transitioning mesh is between the selected four objects. The SURFTAB1 system
variable determines the number of segments in the M direction, and the SURFTAB2
system variable determines the number of segments in the N direction. To change the
value of either SURFTAB1 or SURFTAB2, enter the variable’s name at the command
prompt and then enter the new value when prompted. Figure 13-9 shows a 3D mesh
created by selecting four adjoining edges that are defined splines. Notice that each
spline ends and starts at the endpoint of the adjoining spline.
Exercise 13-6: Creating a 3D Mesh Based on Four Adjoining Edges
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise13-6.dwg from the Chapter 13
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a 3D mesh based on four adjoining edges.
1. Change the value of both the system variables SURFTAB1 and SURFTAB2 to 24.
2. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Edge Mesh.
3. At the Select object 1 for surface edge: prompt, select the edge indi-
cated by 1 in Figure 13-9.
4. At the Select object 2 for surface edge: prompt, select the edge indi-
cated by 2.
5. At the Select object 3 for surface edge: prompt, select the edge indi-
cated by 3.
6. At the Select object 4 for surface edge: prompt, select the edge indi-
cated by 4.

Creating Complex Surfaces
Creating complex surfaces isn’t too much different from creating complex 3D 
solids. The main difference is that you can’t use the commands UNION, SUBTRACT,
INTERSECT, and INTERFERE on surfaces to combine and remove sections from other
objects in your model, so you have to do some additional planning upfront. However,
techniques like lofting and revolving are available for creating complex surfaces.

Chapter 13: Complex Surface Modeling

Because surface objects aren’t created from straight segments like complex 3D
meshes, the objects that you create as surface objects appear smooth rather than
blocky. In these sections, I look at the techniques that you can use to create complex
surfaces.
When creating complex surface objects, the DELOBJ system variable controls — in
most cases — whether the selected 2D profiles that you pick are kept in the drawing or
are deleted. Set DELOBJ to 0 (zero) to keep the original 2D profiles that are selected
after the command ends; otherwise, by default they’re deleted.
Extruded surfaces
Extruding surfaces are very similar to creating extruded 3D solids. To create an
extruded surface, you first select an open 2D profile, not a closed 2D profile. Unlike cre-
ating a tabulated 3D mesh, you can specify a height, direction, or path when creating
an extruded surface from a 2D object. While extruding the 2D object, you can apply a
taper if you need to. To create an extruded surface object, you use the EXTRUDE com-
mand. (To find out more about how to use the EXTRUDE command, see Chapter 6.)
Figure 13-10 shows an open 2D profile before and after using the EXTRUDE command.
Revolved surfaces
You create revolved surfaces the same way that you create a revolved 3D solid, except
that you use an open profile instead of a closed profile. A revolved surface is much
better looking than a 3D mesh that you create with the REVSURF command because a
resolved surface appears curved instead of blocky, as the mesh does.
To create a revolved surface, you use the REVOLVE command. After the command is
started, select the open 2D profile and then the axis that it should be revolved around.
You can specify the axis by using the current X, Y, or Z axis; by using an object; or by
using an axis defined by two points. (To find out more about how to use the REVOLVE
command, see Chapter 8.) Figure 13-11 shows an open 2D profile revolved around a
line that’s used as the axis for the revolution of the profile.

surface.

232
Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces 

Lofted surfaces
You can create surface objects with the lofting technique. To create a lofted surface
object, you need to create two or more open profiles. Then you need to select each
profile in the order that you want the lofting to happen. After that, you can determine
whether the lofted object is created using only the selected cross-sections, by select-
ing a path for the lofted surface to follow, or by using guides to define the surface
object.
The LOFT command creates a lofted surface, and the process is just like creating a
lofted 3D solid. There is no command to create a 3D mesh that’s equivalent to the
LOFT command, other than creating multiple cross sections and using the RULESURF
command. (To find out more about how to use the LOFT command, see Chapter 8.)
Figure 13-12 shows a lofted surface created from several open 2D profiles.
Swept surfaces
Swept surfaces are created in a same way that a swept 3D solid is created. To create a
swept surface, you must have an open 2D profile and a path that are both created from
2D objects. Select the profile and then the path to cast the profile along to create a
swept surface. Additionally, you can adjust the base point and alignment of the 2D pro-
file with the path, and you can specify a scale and twist value for the 2D profile as it is
being cast to create the surface object.
There is no command to create a 3D mesh that’s equal to the SWEEP command. With
some patience and some ingenuity, you can use the DIVIDE command to align 2D pro-
files with a path and then use the RULESURF command to kind of simulate a swept 
3D mesh. To find out more about how to use the SWEEP command, see Chapter 8.
Figure 13-13 shows a swept surface created from an open 2D profile cast along a path.

Converting objects to surfaces
Starting with AutoCAD 2007, you can convert 2D objects to surface objects by using
the CONVTOSURFACE command (Modify➪3D Operations➪Convert to Surface). To
create surfaces from 2D objects, select one of the 2D objects compatible with the com-
mand. The objects that you can select must either be closed or have a thickness
assigned to them. The CONVTOSURFACE command allows you to convert the follow-
ing objects to surface objects:
 2D solids
 Regions
 Open 2D polyline with thickness and no width 
 Lines and arcs with thickness
 Planar 3D faces
You can also convert 2D objects into 3D solids by using the CONVTOSOLID command.
To discover more about the CONVTOSOLID command, see Chapter 8.
Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. What steps do you think you take to create a 3D mesh located on the top of a 3D model?
1. Create a new drawing using the acad3d.dwt drawing template.
2. Start the 3DMESH command.
3. Create a 3D mesh that measures a size of 3 in the M direction and 2 in the N direction.
4. Specify the six points in the drawing to create the 3D mesh.
2. Which of the following is a closed 2D object?
A, C. A closed 2D object is an object that doesn’t have any openings (or gaps) and is one contin-
uous object. Examples of closed 2D objects are circles, ellipses, closed 2D polylines, and closed
2D splines. While you can draw lines and arcs to create a closed boundary, they’re not a single
object. You can convert lines and arcs that form a closed boundary to a closed 2D polyline if
the lines and arcs touch end to end.

 Editing surface objects
A
lthough surface models are limited in how they can be edited, you can use several dif-
ferent methods to modify 3D faces, 3D meshes, and surface objects. You edit surface
models by using commands such as 3DMOVE, COPY, 3DROTATE, and most of the other
modify commands, but few commands are specific to editing surface models (although
there are plenty for 3D solid models). The commands FILLET and CHAMFER don’t have
additional options for editing surfaces like they do with 3D solids, but the PEDIT command
does hold a secret for editing 3D meshes. The exercises in this chapter show you how to
modify 3D faces, 3D meshes, and surface objects.
Editing Surface Models
You edit surface models by using most of the standard editing techniques that you use to
modify 2D objects and even 3D solids. One of the most powerful ways to modify objects in a
drawing is through the use of grips; you can use grips to move, rotate, copy, and scale
objects that create surface models. For example, you can stretch objects like 3D faces and
meshes by using grips. When stretching a 3D face or mesh with grips, you’re moving the ver-
tices of the object or objects. By using grips with 3D faces and meshes, you can quickly add a
feature like tapering between surfaces. Surface objects can’t be deformed like 3D faces, but
meshes can be deformed because they aren’t defined by a series of vertices.
Go to the Properties palette (Tools➪Palettes➪Properties) to modify the properties and ver-
tices of 3D faces, 3D meshes, and surface objects. You can modify general properties such as
color, layer, or material, along with object-specific properties like the location of a vertex and
an object’s height. The properties that are displayed in the Properties palette depend on
what type of object is selected and the number of objects that are selected.
Editing 3D Faces
As you create a 3D face, you determine where each endpoint of the object is created and
which sides remain visible. It’s often easier to just worry about creating the 3D face first and
then determine which edges should be visible. You can adjust the endpoints of a 3D face by
using grips of the properties Vertex, Vertex X, Vertex Y, and Vertex Z in the Properties palette.
The Vertex property allows you to designate which vertex of the 3D face you want to work
with. The selected vertex is indicated in the drawing by an X.

Using grips to modify the location of a vertex for a 3D face is easier than using the
Properties palette. Along with editing the vertices of a 3D face and its general properties
by using grips and the Properties palette, you can change which edges are visible.
When creating 3D faces, it takes time to figure out exactly which edges you want visi-
ble and which ones you want hidden. If you didn’t take the time to figure this out when
you created your 3D face, you can use the EDGE command to change the visibility of
the edges. 
The EDGE command allows you to interactively select the edges on a 3D face or
shared edges between two 3D faces to mark both the overlapping edges invisible. The
EDGE command can also redisplay an invisible edge of a 3D face. Choose Draw➪
Modeling➪Meshes➪Edge or enter edge at the command prompt and then select the
edges you want to mark as invisible. The invisible edge isn’t displayed in the drawing
unless you set the SPLFRAME system variable to 1. Then you have to regenerate the
drawing (View➪Regen All). 
Figure 14-1 shows a surface model created with 3D faces. The image on the left shows
all edges for the 3D faces visible, whereas the one on the right shows select adjoining
edges on the top and bottom of the model set invisible to give the surfaces a cleaner
look. 
The Properties palette allows you to change the visibility for each edge of a 3D face, but
it can be a little hard to tell which edge you’re about to make invisible because you just
choose from the properties Edge 1, Edge 2, Edge 3, and Edge 4 under the Geometry cat-
egory. Controlling the visibility of the edges for the 3D faces through the palette doesn’t
really make sense unless you want all the edges for the selected 3D faces to be visible
or invisible.

Exercise 14-1: Hiding Edges of 3D Faces 
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise14-1.dwg from the Chapter 14
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice making
edges of a 3D face invisible and displaying hidden edges. 
1. Choose Draw➪Modeling➪Meshes➪Edge.
2. At the Specify edge of 3dface to toggle visibility or [Display]:
prompt, select the line indicated by 1 in Figure 14-2.
Don’t select an edge more than once; otherwise, you might inadvertently make it
visible.
3. Continue selecting the edges marked 2 through 10 and press Enter when you’ve
picked the last edge to end the command.
4. With no command active, select the two 3D faces that met at the edge indicated
by 11 in Figure 14-2 using a crossing window. Pick a point below and to the right
of the edge and then pick a point above and to the left of the edge to select both
edges.
5. Display the Properties palette (choose Tools➪Palettes➪Properties). In the
Properties palette, select Hidden from the Edge 4 property.
The model now appears incomplete because the edge that was indicated by 11 is
invisible.
6. Restart the EDGE command. At the Specify edge of 3dface to toggle
visibility or [Display]: prompt, enter D and press Enter.
You see the display mode of the EDGE command, which allows you to redisplay
edges of 3D faces. 
7. At the Enter selection method for display of hidden edges
[Select/All] <All>: prompt, enter A and press Enter.
All the edges in the drawing now appear as dashed lines, which allows you to
select them. You can use the Select option to select 3D faces in the drawing that
you want to see the invisible edges for.

8. At the Specify edge of 3dface to toggle visibility or [Display]:
prompt, pick the line indicated by 11 in Figure 14-2 and press Enter to end the
command.
The edge is now visible once again.
9. At the command prompt, enter splframe and press Enter.
10. At the Enter new value for SPLFRAME <0>: prompt, enter 1 and press
Enter.
The invisible edges of the 3D faces are now allowed to be displayed in the draw-
ing, but won’t be displayed until the current viewport is regenerated. 
11. Choose View➪Regen or View➪Regen All.
The invisible edges of the 3D faces are now displayed in the current viewport.
The difference between the Regen and Regen All option is that Regen performs a
regeneration only on the current viewport, whereas Regen All regenerates the
current viewport and all other viewports in the drawing. The drawing looks like
the image on the left in Figure 14-1.
12. Change SPLFRAME back to a value of 0 (zero) and then regenerate the drawing.
The model looks like the image on the right in Figure 14-1.
13. Save the drawing with the name Completed14-1.dwg to the Chapter 14 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Editing 3D Meshes
Modifying 3D meshes is slightly different from 3D faces, and it varies based on the type
of 3D mesh you’re modifying. You can modify polygon meshes in a few additional ways
that aren’t supported for polyface meshes. You create polyface meshes by using the
PFACE command, and you create polygon meshes by using either the 3DMESH com-
mand or one of the options of the 3D command. I cover creating polygon meshes by
using the 3D command in Chapter 12 and the 3DMESH command in Chapter 13. You
find out about creating polyface meshes in Chapter 13.
You can use the standard modifying commands when editing 3D meshes, with the
exceptions of commands like BREAK, TRIM, EXTEND, FILLET, and CHAMFER.
Commonly, you’re moving (or stretching) the vertices of a mesh using either grip edit-
ing or the Properties palette. Like grip editing with 3D faces, you can quickly modify all
edges where vertices intersect using grips. You can also adjust the vertices of a 3D
mesh by using the properties Vertex, Vertex X, Vertex Y, and Vertex Z in the Properties
palette. The Vertex property allows you to designate which vertex on the mesh you
want to work with. The selected vertex is indicated in the drawing by an X.
238
Part IV: 3D Modeling — Surfaces 
2.
The _______________ and _______________ directions of a 3D mesh object control the number
of vertices.
The Properties palette allows you to see the number of vertices used to create a 3D
mesh, but you can’t edit these values. The only way to add new vertices to a 3D mesh
is to start over and create a completely new 3D mesh based on new coordinate points.
Additionally, you can smooth a polygon mesh so it appears more contoured and break
down a mesh into multiple objects.

Smoothing a mesh
Meshes are created by defining a number of vertices in both the M and N directions for
polygon meshes or through a series of vertices, which define the surfaces of a polyface
mesh. Polyface meshes are limited to the points you defined before determining how
the mesh is created. But you can smooth polygon meshes — like their not-so-distant
cousin, the polyline — to give them a more curved look. To smooth a polygon mesh,
you can use either the PEDIT command or the Properties palette.
When you want to smooth a polygon mesh, you can choose three different surface-
smoothing options: Quadratic, Cubic, or Bezier. Each option affects the 3D mesh in a
slightly different way. When you apply one of the smoothing options, you can change
the density that the mesh is created with. The PEDIT command allows you to smooth
a polygon mesh but doesn’t allow you to specify a smoothing option. The SURFTYPE
system variable controls the type of smoothing that is used with the PEDIT command.
If SURFTYPE is set to a value of 5, Quadratic smoothing is used. A value of 6 for
SURFTYPE indicates Cubic smoothing, whereas a value of 8 indicates that Bezier
smoothing should be used to smooth a polygon mesh.
If you change the smoothing option for a polygon mesh by using the Properties
palette, you can specify a new density for the mesh to help make its edges appear
curved from a distance instead of straight. To make the mesh denser and appear more
curved, you adjust the M Density and N Density properties of the mesh. Figure 14-3
shows a mesh before and after the mesh’s density is changed and Quadratic smooth-
ing is applied.
A mesh no more
Meshes are complex objects like polylines, regions, and 3D solids. Like other complex
objects, AutoCAD can break down certain objects into more basic 2D and 3D objects.
For example, you can explode a polyline into lines and arcs or a 3D solid into regions.
Breaking down a complex 3D object is no different from a complex 2D object: You use
the EXPLODE command (Modify➪Explode). When you select a 3D mesh at the Select
objects: prompt for the EXPLODE command, AutoCAD takes a look at the mesh and
calculates which edges are visible or invisible and creates individual 3D faces based on
the vertices of the 3D mesh.
When you explode a polygon mesh, AutoCAD creates four-sided 3D faces, and all edges
are visible. Exploding a polyface mesh results in the creation of both three- and four-
sided 3D faces. The 3D faces that are created after exploding a polyface mesh retain
their edge visibility settings, so if the edge was invisible before the 3D mesh was
exploded, it becomes invisible after you explode it.

Exercise 14-2: Modifying a Polygon Mesh 
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise14-2.dwg from the Chapter 14
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice apply-
ing the Quadratic smoothing option to a polygon face mesh and change the meshes
density to make it smoother. 
1. Select the polygon mesh and display the Properties palette.
2. On the Properties palette, select the Fit/Smooth property located under the Misc
category near the bottom of the Properties palette.
3. From the drop-down list that appears, select Quadratic.
The polygon mesh doesn’t appear as blocky along the edges, and the mesh is
much denser.
4. Click in the text box to the right of the M Density property in the Properties
palette. Enter a new value of 12 and press Enter.
5. Change the N Density property to a value of 12.
6. Press Esc to remove the grips from the 3D mesh so you can get a better look at it.
The 3D mesh appears much smoother than it did before you changed the values
for both the M and N density properties. 
7. Select the polygon mesh once again and this time explode it by using the
EXPLODE command.
8. Try selecting the polygon mesh after it has been exploded. You only select one of
the newly created 3D faces instead.
The drawing now looks like the 3D mesh on the right side of Figure 14-3.
9. Save the drawing with the name Completed14-2.dwg to the Chapter 14 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Editing Surface Objects
Modifying surface objects is much different from modifying 3D faces or meshes. You
can’t use grip editing to adjust the vertices of the mesh that is displayed on-screen
because a surface object has no vertices. The lines that you see are the isolines of the
object that help you identify whether the object is curved or flat. You can change the
number of isolines that are displayed by using the Properties palette. Along with iso-
lines affecting the display of a surface object, the VIEWRES command and FACETRES
system variable also affect how a surface object appears in the drawing. (To find out
more about VIEWRES and FACETRES, see Chapter 6.)
The Properties palette allows you to change properties that define dimensional char-
acteristics of a surface object. For example, if you extrude an arc, you can change the

extruded surface’s height and taper angle with the Properties palette. Each complex
surface object has a different set of properties that appears in the Geometry category
on the Properties palette.
Reshaping a surface
Although it isn’t possible to adjust the vertices of a surface object like you can with 3D
faces or meshes, you can adjust dimensional characteristics of a surface object by
using grips (such as its height if it’s an extruded surface) or by using the original object
that you used to create the surface object. So if an arc is extruded to create a channel,
you can go back and change the arc’s radius or its start and end points. Being able to
edit the original 2D profile is very similar to being able to update the history of a 3D
solid.
To change the shape of a surface object, select a surface object when no command is
active to display its grips. Then you can edit the original object just as if it was a 2D
object by first selecting the grip and then entering a new value or location for the
selected grip. Figure 14-4 shows a surface object created by sweeping a 2D polyline
along a path; grips for both the path and the original 2D polyline are displayed. The
grips on the 2D polyline that was swept along the path are displayed on the end of the
3D object, whereas the grips for the object used as the path are displayed along the 3D
object and are indicated by the arrows in Figure 14-4.
Surfaces to wireframe
Exploding a surface object with the EXPLODE command doesn’t quite produce the
results that you might think — probably a 3D mesh of some sort or 3D faces. Actually,
you get a wireframe of the surface object.

Which of the following best describes a wireframe model? 
A.
A model that is created from 3D objects and displayed with the 2D Wireframe or 3D
Wireframe visual style.
B.
A model that is made up of 2D objects drawn at isometric angles.
C.
A model that is made up of 2D objects that are drawn with a Z value greater than, equal to, or
less than 0 (zero) to make the 2D objects appear as if they were 3D objects with the edges
beyond not hidden.

When you have a wireframe model, you can create a mesh from the 2D objects created,
use the 2D objects as construction lines to create 3D solids, or simply create a wireframe
model. If you want to create a wireframe model from a surface object or 3D solid without
using the EXPLODE command, you can use the XEDGES command to extract the visible
edges of your model. The XEDGES command works on surface objects or 3D solids only;
it doesn’t work on 3D faces or meshes. To start the XEDGES command, enter xedges at
the command prompt or choose Modify➪3D Operations➪Extract Edges.
Slicing through 3D solids
Although the SLICE command doesn’t allow you to modify surface objects, you can use
surface objects as the slicing plane to shape 3D solids. To do so, make sure the surface
object intersects the 3D solid. Start the SLICE command and select the 3D solids that
you want to cut through. After you select the 3D solids to cut, use the Surface option
to select a complex surface object that you created with the EXTRUDE, LOFT, SWEEP,
or REVOLVE command. You can also use the Planar Surface option and select a planar
surface object that you created with the PLANESURF command. After you cut the 3D
solid, you need to select which part of the 3D solid to keep. Figure 14-5 shows a 3D
solid before and after it’s sliced with an extruded spline. (To find out more about the
SLICE command, see Chapter 9.)
Exercise 14-3: Modifying a Surface Object 
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise14-3.dwg from the Chapter 14
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice modify-
ing a surface object that was created with the EXTRUDE command and use it as a slic-
ing plane with the SLICE command. 
1. Turn on object snap mode and enable the Endpoint running object snap.
To turn on object snap mode, right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar and
choose On from the shortcut menu. To enable the Endpoint running object snap,
right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar and choose Settings from the
shortcut menu. In the Drafting Settings dialog box, on the Object Snap tab, click
the Clear All button and then click the Endpoint check box. Click OK to return to
the drawing. 
2. Select the surface object that’s inside the box to display its grips.

3. Select the grip indicated by 1 in Figure 14-6 and select the end point of the 3D
solid indicated by 2.
The grip at the point indicated by 1 is one of the end points of the spline used to
create the extruded surface object.
4. With the grips still displayed, select the grip indicated by 3 in Figure 14-6 and
snap it to the end point of the 3D solid indicated by 4.
5. Turn on ortho mode and select the grip indicated by 5 in Figure 14-6.
6. With the grip selected, drag to the right and enter a value of 6. Press Enter to
adjust the height of the surface object.
7. Start the SLICE command (Modify➪3D Operations➪Slice).
8. At the Select objects: prompt, select the 3D box and press Enter.
9. At the Specify start point of slicing plane or [planar Object/
Surface/Zaxis/View/XY/YZ/ZX/3points] <3points>: prompt, enter S
and press Enter to use the Surface option.
10. At the Select a surface: prompt, select the surface object.
11. At the Select solid to keep or [keep Both sides] <Both>: prompt,
select the edge of the 3D solid indicated by 6 in Figure 14-6.
The bottom of the 3D solid is kept and so is the surface object. The SLICE com-
mand doesn’t remove the surface object that’s used as the cutting plane, so if
you no longer need it, you can delete it.

2. When prompted to specify the corners of the 3D face, pick in the drawing window or enter
coordinate values at the command prompt.
3. Specify a minimum of three points. Before specifying a point, remember to determine if the
edge that you are creating for the 3D face should be hidden or not.
2. The M and N directions of a 3D mesh object control the number of vertices.

3. Specify the location of each of the vertices for the 3D mesh.
4. Which of the following best describes a wireframe model?
C. Wireframe models are created from 2D objects that are given a Z value that is greater than,
equal to, or less than 0 (zero) and isn’t capable of hiding objects beyond. Answer A is incorrect
because a 3D object displayed with the 2D Wireframe or 3D Wireframe visual styles is still a 3D
model that is capable of hiding objects. Answer B is wrong because drawing 2D objects at iso-
metric angles might give the appearance of 3D objects, the drawing that is created is still flat.

ing techniques by using commands to create primitives such as a box or cone or to create
complex meshes and surfaces by revolving 2D profiles. The exercises in this chapter con-
tinue the exercises in Chapters 7 and 11, and you create parts for the model by using 3D

Modeling with Meshes
In this series of exercises, you create a 3D model of a bearing to be attached to the model of
the rear assembly for the custom motorcycle. Like the model of the shock that you create 
in Chapter 11 by using 3D solids, the bearing is a purchased part. Because the part is being
purchased, you would normally obtain the dimensional characteristics of the part from the
vendor or actually measure a physical part yourself to create the 3D model.

ing the smoothing option and mesh density of the revolved meshes that you created in
the previous exercise to make them appear smoother.
1. Select the four polygon meshes that you created in Exercise 15-1.
2. Display the Properties palette and select Quadratic from the Fit/Smooth property.
3. Set the M Density to a value of 34 and N Density to a value of 42.
As you change the values, they might change in the Properties palette because of
the original values used for the SURFTAB1 and SURFTAB2 system variables when
creating the revolved meshes. The updated revolved meshes look like the ones
in Figure 15-4. Refer to Figure 15-3 to see what the revolved meshes looked like
before you smoothed them.

ighting and materials bring your 3D models to life by
giving them realistic colors and textures and provid-
ing depth through lit and shaded areas. You can add light-
ing to emulate small light sources like LEDs and much
larger sources of lighting like the sun. Materials give your
models a realistic look through textures, patterns, and
colors.
You can then generate a rendering of the model with the
materials applied and have AutoCAD calculate how the
lights in a drawing emit light and cast shadows. Along with
discovering how to render still images that you can save
to a file, you find out how to create a basic animation of
your model that you can share with others.

L
ighting in AutoCAD allows you to re-create light sources in your 3D models to do one of
two different things. It adds realistic lighting and highlights to your models that would
be present in a manufactured part such as an LED (light-emitting diode) or a ceiling light
hanging overhead of your assembly of a large machine. You can also create artificial lighting
that might not be present in the real world but that helps you draw focus to a specific part
or feature in your 3D model. 
But highlighting can also make a 3D model look artificial and unbelievable if not done prop-
erly. The exercises in this chapter show you how to create and modify some of the different
types of lights and lighting systems that you can use with your 3D models.
Overview of Lighting
Lighting in AutoCAD is composed of two types of lighting systems: default and user-defined.
The default lighting system is present in each drawing that you create. The user-defined light-
ing system requires a bit more work than just opening a drawing, as well it should because
you’re setting it up. Starting with AutoCAD 2008, user-defined lighting comes in two different
types: standard and photometric. Standard lighting was available in AutoCAD 2007 and prior
releases. Photometric lighting is new in AutoCAD, but it has been around for a number of
years in other software packages, like 3ds Max and Autodesk Viz.
To use user-defined light or Sunlight system, you must turn off DEFAULTLIGHTING.
When rendering a 3D model that contains viewports with both default lighting and user-
defined lighting, you can force user-defined lights for all viewports with the system variable
RENDERUSERLIGHTS set to a value of 1. If you want a combination of default lighting and
user-defined lights for different floating viewports in your drawing, you need to set 
RENDERUSERLIGHTS to a value of 0. The RENDERUSERLIGHTS system variable makes it
much easier to enable the use of user-defined lights instead of setting DEFAULTLIGHTING 
to 0 for each floating viewport in your drawing.
When using user-defined lights and creating renderings, the results that you get may vary
from those shown in this book. The reason for the differences is due to a number of factors,
such as monitor and video card settings. The brightness and contrast of the monitor can
make the images appear too dark or washed out. So you might have to work with the inten-
sity settings of the lights used in the exercises to get the best results. When sharing render-
ings electronically, ask your co-workers whether the renderings created might be too dark or
light. Often, printing a rendered image gives you the best control over the final product.

Default lighting
Default lighting isn’t a complex lighting system to use — especially because AutoCAD
does all the work for you — but it isn’t useful when trying to create realistic renderings
that have shadows, and it doesn’t support attenuation like user-defined lights do.
Default lighting turns out quick and basic renderings that don’t have shadows. As you
change the view of your drawing with default lighting enabled, the default lights move
with the current view so they aren’t stationary, like user-defined lights
The system variable DEFAULTLIGHTING determines whether default lighting is used
during rendering. By default, DEFAULTLIGHTING is set to a value of 1, indicating that
default lighting is enabled. You can disable DEFAULTLIGHTING by setting it to a 
value of 0.
When you use default lighting, you have a choice of using one or two lights; by 
default, two lights are used. To change the number of lights, use the system variable
DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE. When the system variable DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE is 
set to 1, two over-the-shoulder lights are used, whereas the DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE
set to 0 (zero) uses one light. The values assigned to DEFAULTLIGHTING and 
DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE are saved with the drawing and can be set in a custom 
drawing template that you use to create your new drawings from.
User-defined lighting
User-defined lights require more work on your part than using the default lighting
system, but the rewards are worth the time it takes to get it right. 
For each viewport that you want to use user-defined lights in, set DEFAULTLIGHTING
appropriately with the following methods: 
 Enter defaultlighting at the command prompt, and when prompted, enter a
value of 0 to disable default lighting or 1 to enable default lighting.
 Click the Viewport Lighting Mode toggle on the Lights control panel on the
Dashboard palette to toggle between the use of default lighting and user-defined
lights in the current viewport. 
When you create user-defined lights, you can use either standard or photometric 
lighting:
 Standard: This type of lighting was in all AutoCAD versions up to AutoCAD 2007.
When LIGHTINGUNITS is set to 0, standard lights are used. You can create three
types of user-defined lights — point, spotlight, and distant lights — along with
using the Sunlight system. 
When you use standard lights, you have to deal with certain restrictions on
which types of lights are available — and in some cases certain settings for light-
ing and rendering. The Sunlight system is restricted from simulating the sky, the
Sun & Sky background option isn’t available for named views or cameras, render-
ing exposure isn’t supported, and midtones aren’t available for global lighting.
Outside those limitations, you can use standard lights to add lighting to your 3D
models, which can add depth to your renderings by highlighting specific parts
and cast shadows.
258
Part V: Visualizing the Design 

 Photometric: This type of light is new to AutoCAD 2008. Photometric lights are
used during rendering when LIGHTINGUNITS is set to a value of 1 or 2. A value of
1 indicates that International lighting units are used, and a value of 2 indicates
that American lighting units are used. Photometric lights represent lights in the
real world. They’re similar to standard lights, with the exception that photomet-
ric lights always attenuate and define the intensity of a light. In addition to being
able to define lights of the types point, spotlight, and distant and to use the
Sunlight system, you can create weblights.
Photometric lights are the preferred type of lights because they offer many more
options over standard lights, and they do a better job of representing lights in
the real world. The down side to photometric lights is that they don’t offer the
ability to control the attenuation values of the light like standard lights do. 
You can change the lighting units. Open the Drawing Units dialog box (Format➪Units)
and select one of the available options from the Units for Specifying the Intensity 
of Lighting drop-down list under the Lighting section. From the Units for Specifying 
the Intensity of Lighting drop-down list, you can choose Generic, International, or
American. Generic allows you to use standard lights, while International and American
are used to enable the use of photometric lights. 
Lights in blocks
Referencing drawings is very common when creating complex 3D models, but when
you reference or insert a drawing that contains user-defined lights, they’re brought
into the drawing as well. You have the option to allow user-defined lights created as
part of a block or reference drawing to participate in emitting light during rendering.
The system variable LIGHTSINBLOCK controls whether lights contained in blocks
affect the lighting of a 3D model. If LIGHTSINBLOCK is set to a value of 1, lights con-
tained in blocks are used during rendering; otherwise, a value of 0 disables lights 
contained in blocks, and they’re ignored during rendering.
259
Chapter 16: Lighting
1.
In the exercises in the chapter, you add lights to a model. Before doing so, you should render
your drawing to see how it realistically looks before adding lights. To render a drawing, choose
View➪_______________➪_______________.
Creating User-Defined Lights
User-defined lights give your renderings greater depth and visual appeal than default
lighting because you control the color of the light that is emitted, the direction the
light is emitted in, and the intensity in which the light is emitted. AutoCAD allows you
to create four different user-defined lights in your drawings: point lights, spotlights,
weblights, and distant lights. You can also take control of the Sunlight system, which
allows you to adjust the angle and location of the Sun in a drawing.
After you add a light to the drawing, a graphical representation known as a glyph is dis-
played. Figure 16-1 shows the three different types of light glyphs. The glyph for a
point light looks like a circle with lines running through it, the glyph for a spotlight
looks like a flashlight, and the glyph for a weblight looks like a mesh object. The glyph
for a weblight looks different based on the IES file that’s assigned to it.
Distant lights and the Sunlight system don’t have glyphs displayed for them in the
drawing window to designate where they’re located or the direction in which they emit
light.

If you don’t see light glyphs in the drawing, click the Light Glyphs toggle in the
expanded section of the Lights control panel on the Dashboard palette or change the
value of the system variable LIGHTGLYPHDISPLAY to 1. Light glyphs by default don’t
plot unless the Plot Glyph property for the light is set to Yes in the Properties palette. 
You can control the size of the light glyphs by clicking the Light Glyph Settings button
on the Drafting tab of the Options dialog box to display the Light Glyph Appearance
dialog box (see Figure 16-2). In the Light Glyph Appearance dialog box, change the size
of the light glyphs and their color.
Point lights
Point lights are one of the most commonly used user-defined lights in AutoCAD. A
point light is similar to a candle or a light bulb because it emits light equally in all direc-
tions. Although point lights do emit light in all directions, you can define a point light
with a target in mind, which doesn’t affect how the light is emitted. 
You create point lights two ways:
 Use the LIGHT command, with either the Point or Targetpoint option. 
 Choose View➪Render➪Light➪New Point Light or click Create a Point Light on
the Lights control panel.
Figure 16-3 shows a point light over a wedge and between a sphere and cone primitive.
The light is emitted equally away from the center of the point light in all directions.

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

Spotlights
Spotlights are the second most commonly used user-defined lights in AutoCAD. A spot-
light is similar to a flashlight or a movie projector because it emits light in a cone shape
and in a specific direction. Spotlights use hotspot and falloff properties to define the
brightest light emitted along the path and where the light starts to dim. The innermost
part of the cone of light is known as the hotspot, and it is the brightest part of the light
that’s emitted; the area outside the hotspot is where the light becomes dimmer the far-
ther away it gets from the hotspot. Like point lights, you can define spotlights with or
without a target.
You create spotlights with the following methods:
 Use the LIGHT command, with either the Spot or Freespot option. 
 Choose View➪Render➪Light➪Create Spotlight. 
 Click Create a Spotlight on the Lights control panel. 
Figure 16-4 shows a spotlight over a wedge and between a sphere and cone primitive. Notice
that the light is the brightest over the wedge and gets dimmer the farther it moves a way.
Weblights
Weblights are the newest type of light in AutoCAD and are available only with photomet-
ric lighting. A weblight is a cross between a point light and a spotlight due to the way it
emits light. Instead of emitting light along a path in one direction or in all directions, a
weblight emits light by the IES file it is assigned. An IES (Illuminating Engineering 
Society) file contains information about how an actual light in the real world emits light.
Manufacturers of light fixtures provide IES files, and you can often obtain them for free
from the manufacturer’s Web site.

Chapter 16: Lighting

AutoCAD ships with example IES files located in the Webfiles folder. To locate the
Webfiles folder on your computer, open the Options dialog box and click the Files tab.
On the Files tab, expand the Web File Search Path node.
You can create weblights with the LIGHT command and either the Web or Freeweb
option. Figure 16-5 shows a weblight over a wedge and between a sphere and cone
primitive. The light is the brightest closest to the wedge and gets dimmer the farther it
moves away.
Distant lights
Distant lights fill a drawing with a light that has a consistent color and intensity. A dis-
tant light is like the Sun because it emits light in one direction and doesn’t attenuate
(fall off) like other user-defined lights do. When you create a distant light, you specify
the direction in which the light is emitted. 
You create distant lights with the following methods:
 Use the LIGHT command with the Distant option. 
 Choose View➪Render➪Light➪New Distant Light. 
 Click Create a Distant Light on the Lights control panel. 
Figure 16-6 shows a distant light brightening a drawing containing wedge, sphere, and
cone primitives. The distant light in the drawing emits light at an angle, and the light
emitted doesn’t increase or decrease in intensity like the other lights do.

Model in the AutoCAD help system. To locate the topic, display the Online Help system
and click the Contents tab. On the Contents tab, choose User’s Guide➪Create Realistic
Images and Graphics.
Sunlight
The Sunlight system in AutoCAD allows you to replicate the light emitted from the Sun.
It is usually used for exterior renderings of buildings or interior renderings where light
might come in through a window. You specify the location and angle of the Sun relative
to a specific location on the planet defined by longitude, latitude, and the direction of
North. You enable the Sunlight system by clicking the Sun Status button on the Lights
control panel or setting the Status property in the Sun Properties palette to On. The
Sun Properties palette is where you do most of the configuring for the Sunlight system,
but you can also use the Date and Time sliders on the Lights control panel. 
To display the Sun Properties palette, click the Edit the Sun button under the expanded
section of the Lights control panel or choose View➪Render➪Light➪Sun Properties.
With the Sun Properties palette (see Figure 16-9), you can specify the calendar day, time

of day, and various other properties that affect the positioning and color of light emit-
ted by the Sun. When you use photometric lighting, you can simulate the sky as the
background of the current view and display a disc in the sky to show the location and
intensity of the Sun.
The Geographic Location dialog box specifies the location on the planet in which the
3D model resides (see Figure 16-10). By using a geographic location, you accurately
represent the location of the Sun and simulate the sky at specific time intervals. To dis-
play the Geographic Location dialog box, click the Launch Geographic Location button
in the Geographic Location category or click Geographic Location in the expanded
section of the Lights control panel.

Using Predefined Lights from Tool Palettes
AutoCAD comes installed with several tool palettes of predefined lights. You can
choose between generic (or standard) lights and photometric lights. You can access
the predefined lights from the Generic Lights and Photometric Lights tool palette
groups on the Tool Palettes Window (see Figure 16-11). To access these tool palette
groups, display the Tool Palettes Window (choose Tools➪Palettes➪Tool Palettes) and
right-click the title bar of the Tool Palettes Window when it isn’t docked, or right-click
the double grip bar at the top when it is docked. From the shortcut menu, choose
either Generic Lights or Photometric Lights. Then click one of the tools to place a light
based on the predefined settings or click a tab to switch between the available tool
palettes in the selected group. 
Modifying Lights
Lights are like other objects that you find in a drawing; they have properties that you
can modify at any time to adjust the way they affect your 3D model during rendering.
Table 16-1 lists the common properties that user-defined lights have.
Table 16-1
Command Properties of User-Defined Lights
Property Name
Description
Name
The name assigned to a user-defined light. AutoCAD assigns a default
name for each light that you create. For example, if you create a point
light, AutoCAD assigns it the name Pointlight1. For each new light that
you create, AutoCAD increments the number at the end of the name by 1.
Intensity/
Specifies the brightness level of the light; the greater the intensity value, 
Intensity Factor
the brighter the light emitted.

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

Property Name
Description
Status
Controls whether the light is currently enabled or disabled. When the
light is disabled, it isn’t used during rendering.
Photometry
The photometry property is available only when photometric lighting is
enabled. This option allows you to specify the intensity of a photometric
light by using the measurement values of Candela, Lux, or Foot-candle.
Along with the intensity, you can choose one of the standard color
names or a Kelvin temperature for the light, which affects the color of
light emitted.
Shadow
Controls whether a light casts shadows and which type of shadow is
cast. You can choose among Sharp, Soft Mapped, and Soft Sampled
shadows. Sharp shadows are the fastest to be created during rendering,
but they don’t look as nice as Soft Mapped or Soft Sampled shadows.
Attenuation
Determines whether the emitted light falls off and at what distance the
falloff ends. All lights with the exception of the Sunlight and distant lights
can have attenuation, which affects how light decreases the farther it
gets from the source. You can choose to use no attenuation, or you can
use either Inverse Linear or Inverse Square attenuation. The Inverse
Square attenuation option emulates the way lights in the real world fall
off and is the only option when you use photometric lighting. 
Color/Filter 
Controls the color of the light emitted. You could use a green color for an 
Color
LED or a soft yellow color for an incandescent light bulb.
When adjusting a light using grips, you can adjust the following:
 The source location of the light and its target point (if it has one).
 The hotspot and falloff of a spotlight.
 The attenuation limits of a standard light. (You can adjust this right in the draw-
ing window as well.) 
To adjust a light by using grips, select the glyph and then the grip that you want to adjust.
267

3.
To adjust lights using grips, you must have grip editing enabled. How do you enable grip editing?
A.
In the Options dialog box
B.
On the Properties palette
C.
In the Tool Palettes Window
If you want to adjust properties of a light other than the source point, target point,
attenuation limits, hotspot, and falloff, use the Properties palette. From the Properties
palette, you can adjust the following:
 Turn a light on or off
 Control the type of shadows it casts, intensity level, and other settings
If you can’t see a light in the drawing to edit its properties or you have light glyphs
turned off, you can use the Lights in Model palette (see Figure 16-12) to select a light in
the drawing file. The Lights in Model palette is the only way to select a distant light to
edit its properties. You can then right-click and select Properties to display the
Properties palette or select Delete Light to remove the light from the drawing.

The Lights in Model palette displays the name of each light in the drawing, and one of
four icons indicates what type of light you’re selecting. To display the Lights in Model
palette, click Light List on the Lights control panel or choose Tools➪Palettes➪Lights.
Exercise 16-2: Modifying User-Defined Lights
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise16-2.dwg from the Chapter 16
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice modify-
ing lights.
1. Choose Tools➪Palettes➪Lights.
2. On the Lights in Model palette, select the Accent-light option and right-click.
From the shortcut menu, select Properties.
3. On the Properties palette, set the property Intensity Factor to a value of 0.05.
4. Click the Filter Color property and select Select Color from the drop-down list. In
the Select Color dialog box, click the Index Color tab and select color 61. Click
OK to exit the Select Color dialog box.
5. On the Lights in Model palette, select the Fill-light and set the property Intensity
Factor to a value of 0.5 on the Properties palette
6. Click the Shadows property and select Off from the drop-down list.
7. Render the model to see what effect changing the properties of the lights had on
the 3D model.
The rendering looks similar to Figure 16-13. The model appears much better (com-
pare it to Figure 16-8) and the specific features of the 3D model are clear now.
8. Save the drawing with the name Completed16-2.dwg to the Chapter 16 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Global Lighting
Global lighting affects a rendering no matter what kind of lighting you use. To adjust
the global lighting, click the double down arrows located on the Lights control panel to
expand the panel (see Figure 16-14). You can change the brightness and contrast levels
globally for the entire rendering. Doing so allows you to increase the brightness level
of a rendering if it appears too dark overall or decrease the brightness level if it
appears too washed out. In addition to brightness and contrast, you can adjust the
level of midtone values that can help bring out additional details in a rendering. When
LIGHTINGUNITS is set to 0, the midtones slider isn’t accessible but is available when
LIGHTINGUNITS is set to 1 or 2. Both the brightness and contrast sliders are accessible
no matter what the current value of LIGHTINGUNITS is set to.
If you have LIGHTINUNTIS set to a value of 1 or 2, you can also adjust global lighting
using the Adjust Rendered Exposure dialog box (see Figure 16-15). Using the Adjust
Rendered Exposure dialog box gives you a mini-preview of what the most recent ren-
dering would look like with the new exposure settings. You don’t have to render the
drawing first to make sure it looks like you want it to. You can display the Adjust
Rendered Exposure dialog box by using the RENDEREXPOSURE command or by click-
ing the Adjust Exposure button in the expanded section of the Render control panel on
the Dashboard.

ing the brightness, contrast, and midtones globally for the drawing. 
1. Display the Dashboard palette and click the Render button on the Render con-
trol panel.
A rendering of the drawing is created in the Render Window.
2. Expand the Lights control panel and slide the Brightness slider until a value near
50 appears in the text box to the right of the slider.
3. Slide the Contrast slider until a value near 45 appears in the text box to the right
of the slider.
4. Create another rendering of the drawing to see what the changes look like.
You can compare the current rendering with the previous rendering by clicking
the previous output file at the bottom of the Render Window. The most recent
rendered file is always at the top of the list.
5. Slide the midtone slider on the Lights control panel until a value near 2.5 appears
in the text box to the right of the slider.
6. Create another rendering of the drawing and compare the new rendering with
the previous rendering.
The final rendering of the drawing looks similar to Figure 16-16.
7. Save the drawing with the name Completed16-3.dwg to the Chapter 16 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Exercise 16-4: Using the Render Exposure Dialog Box
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise16-3.dwg from the Chapter 16
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice adjust-
ing the brightness and contrast globally by using the Adjust Render Exposure dialog
box. 
Change some of the settings in the dialog box and see how they affect the Preview
area. After making a few changes, create a rendering of the drawing. Save the drawing
with the name Completed16-4.dwg to the Chapter 16 folder in the My Practice
Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

Turning Old into New
Lights in AutoCAD 2008 are stored in drawing files in a different way than they were in
AutoCAD 2006 and prior, so if you have a drawing that contains old lights and want to
use them, you must use the CONVERTOLDLIGHTS command to change all the old
lights in a drawing to the new type of lights. If you don’t convert the old lights, they
won’t be used for rendering. If old lights are found and converted in the drawing, the
number of lights that were converted is displayed in the AutoCAD Text Window. For
example, the message 3 light(s) converted. indicates that three old lights were
converted in the drawing. 
Remembering the CONVERTOLDLIGHTS command can be a task in itself, so you 
can have AutoCAD update old lights automatically for you by setting the system 
variable 3DCONVERSIONMODE to a value of 1 (which is the default value). 
3DCONVERSIONMODE can also be set to 0, which disables the automatic conversion
of old lights, or to a value of 2, which prompts you when old lights are available for
converting.
Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. To render a drawing, choose View➪Render➪Render. 
Review the rendered image of the drawing in the Render Window.
2. What steps do you take to create a distant light?
1. Choose View➪Render➪Light➪New Distant Light.
2. Disable default lighting if it is enabled.
3. Specify the FROM and TO directions for the distant light.
4. Use the Name option and enter a new name.
5. Use the other options that the command offers and press Enter to complete the command.
3. How do you enable grip editing?
A. In the Options dialog box (choose Tools➪Options). Click the Selection tab, and select the
Enable Grips check box under the Grips section.
For more information on enabling grip editing, see Chapter 9.

M
aterials are the key to making your 3D models look realistic; lighting alone can’t make
solid colors appear lifelike, nor is everything in the real world only defined by solid
colors. Although materials are one of the most advanced features in AutoCAD, they’re not
complex. You can create your own materials from scratch or use predefined materials.
AutoCAD comes with a large number of predefined materials that are organized into
libraries. You can also create your own library of the materials from the ones that you
create and use for your 3D models.
If you don’t like how a specific material looks, you can adjust the properties, such as Diffuse
Color, Opacity, and Self-Illumination. Each of the properties of a material helps you re-create 
a material found in the real world.
After you define a material, all you have to do is attached it to a 3D object or face. You can
modify a material at any time, allowing you to tweak the color or other attributes of a mate-
rial as needed. You can also adjust the direction in which a material is applied and where the
pattern starts from through a process called material mapping. After you attach and map
materials, you can then generate a rendering based on the lights and materials in the 3D
model. You might need to adjust materials based on the lights in the 3D model or adjust a
light to give the desired effect of an attached material.
The exercises in this chapter show you how to create, modify, and attach materials.
Creating and Modifying Materials
You create and modify materials with the Materials palette (see Figure 17-1). The Materials
palette is divided into different sections. It controls which materials are available in the draw-
ing and the different properties:
 Check which materials are currently defined. The Available Materials in Drawing cat-
egory allows you to see which materials are currently defined in the drawing and
which ones are currently being used in the Preview Swatches area. Materials currently
in use have a small drawing-file icon displayed in the lower-right corner of the preview
swatch (see the center preview swatch in Figure 17-1). You can refresh the status of the
materials in use in the drawing by clicking Indicate Materials in Use.

 Switch the geometry of the material. Choose to show a box or cylinder instead
of a sphere from the Swatch Geometry drop-down menu. 
 Add an underlay. Display a checkered background by using the Checkered
Underlay toggle.
 Choose how many lights you want. Specify whether you want one or two lights
by choosing from the Preview Swatch Lighting Model drop-down menu. 
 Create new material. Click the Create New Material button. The Create New
Material dialog box opens, which allows you to give the material a name and
optionally a description. AutoCAD by default assigns a default name of Material 1,
Material 2, and so on.
 Set the material to a specific type. Select a type from Type drop-down list. The

types that you can select are Realistic, Realistic Metal, Advanced, and Advanced
Metal. 
 Choose a template. If you select either Realistic or Realistic Metal from the Type
drop-down list, you can select one of the 22 material templates from the Templates
drop-down list. Some of the templates that you can choose are Metal – Brushed,
Plastic, Water, Mirror, and Glass – Clear. 
 Choose global properties. The type of material that you select from the Type
drop-down list affects which properties are available for the material under the
Material Editor – Global category. For example, if you select Realistic, you can
specify a value for Opacity and Translucency, but these same properties aren’t
available when you select Realistic Metal.
 Define a map. Maps allow you to use image files and what are known as proce-
dural maps (defined under the Maps – Global category). Procedural maps are
dynamically created images that allow you to create unique floor tiles, wood
grains, and checker patterns, among a few others. When you use images and pro-
cedural maps, you can adjust the scaling and tiling of the pattern along with an
offset value to control how the image tiles. Additionally, some material types
offer Advanced Lighting Override properties that affect the way light interacts
with the material.
 Navigate materials. Materials can have nested maps and images to represent
floor tiles and wall textures. The Home to Material and Up One Level buttons
allow you to navigate within the material or back to the very top of the material.
The Nested Map drop-down list allows you to see the nested maps that are part
of a material and to navigate to different parts of a material quickly.
 Apply materials. After a material is created, it can be assigned to a 3D object or
an individual face by clicking the Apply Material to Objects button. The Remove
Materials from Selected Objects button allows you to remove materials assigned
to 3D objects and individual faces.
 Purge materials. Materials take up room in a drawing file, and if they are no
longer needed you can purge a material that is no longer needed by clicking the
Purge from Drawing button.
Common material properties
Each type of material affects which properties change the visual characteristics of the
material. Table 17-1 lists the properties and which type of material they’re associated
with.

normal side of the face is assigned a material.
The option is available only when Force Two-

Settings palette. For more information on the
Advanced Render Settings palette, see
Chapter 19.
Maps
In addition to the properties that alter the way a material looks, you can define a 
material by using maps. Maps for a material are defined under the Maps category (see
Figure 17-2) in the Materials palette. You can choose one of eight map types and up to
four different maps for a material. You select a map type and then click the Map
Settings button to access the settings for the selected map. The Map Slider allows you
to determine the percentage of the map that is displayed with the Diffuse color.
276
Part V: Visualizing the Design 

You can select these eight map types:
 Texture: Allows you to use an image file as the texture for a material.
 Checker: Allows you to define a checker pattern with two different colors or map
types.
 Marble: Allows you to define a swirl pattern that looks like the veins in a slate of
marble. You can specify two different colors: One color is the vein color, and the
other is the stone color. 
 Noise: Allows you to create a pattern that has two different colors or map types
and a level of turbulence that affects how the two colors or map types are mixed
together.
 Speckle: Allows you to define a pattern of random dots by using two different
colors and a size value for the speckles.
 Tiles: Allows you to create a repeating pattern of bricks and tiles by using two
different colors or map types to represent the tile/brick color and the color of
the grout. You can also define the size of the tiles/bricks and how they repeat.
 Waves: Allows you to create a random series of waves by using two different
colors. You can specify properties like wave radius, number of waves, amplitude,
and others to determine how the pattern is created. It looks similar to ripples on
a pond.
 Wood: Allows you to define a wood-grain pattern that uses two different colors.
One color is the wood color, and the other color is the grain.

Chapter 17: Materials

The four different map properties that you can choose are similar to the properties
that you can set for a material:
 Diffuse: Use an image or procedural map to define the color or pattern that’s dis-
played for the material.
 Reflection: Specify the reflectivity of a material and assign an image or proce-
dural map that’s reflected in the object that the material is assigned to. This
property isn’t available if you choose Realistic and Realistic Metal materials.
 Opacity: Define which parts of a material should be solid and which parts should
be transparent. White areas are opaque, and darker areas are transparent. 
 Bump: Create a three-dimensional pattern that appears textured or embossed
based on a gray shaded image; darker areas appear embossed.
Previewing materials and maps
You can see a preview of a material at the top of the Materials palette, but if you scroll
down to the Material Offset & Preview category, you can see a much larger preview of
the material. The Material Offset & Preview category allows you to see in real time
what a material will look like without applying it to a 3D object and creating a render-
ing. You can also preview an individual map by clicking the Map Settings button and
then scrolling down to the Offset & Preview category (see Figure 17-4). If you want to
see the results of one of the maps only at the top level of a material, click the Preview
Map Channel Procedural Results. The Map Preview dialog box opens, and you get a
preview of the image or procedural map.
Scaling, Tiling, and Offsetting Materials
When using maps, you often have to control how the material repeats or tiles. Tiling
commonly wraps a 3D object or face with parts of an image over and over again.
Scaling makes an image or procedural map fill or stretch across a 3D object or face.
You might use scaling to place a logo or label on a part and tiling to create a repeating
pattern like a wood pattern. Scaling can take place at the material or map levels, but
scaling a material at the parent level allows you to specify a unit of measurement for
Figure 17-4:
A preview of
a map.
278
Part V: Visualizing the Design 

the scaling factor. Offsetting allows you to shift an image or procedural map to deter-
mine where the map starts and how it tiles. Figure 17-5 shows the Scaling & Tiling cate-
gory that is displayed in the Materials Editor and is used to adjust the tiling, scaling,
and offsetting of a material.
Exercise 17-1: Creating Materials
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise17-1.dwg from the Chapter 17

For more information on creating materials and working with maps, see the topics
Create Materials and Using Maps for Added Realism in the AutoCAD help system. To
locate the topic, display the Online Help system and click the Contents tab. On the
Contents tab, choose User’s Guide➪Create Realistic Images and Graphics➪Materials
and Textures.
Accessing Libraries of Materials
It takes time to understand all the ins and outs of materials; that’s why AutoCAD ships
with a large number of materials. AutoCAD comes with two different sets of material
libraries: one that’s installed by default with AutoCAD and one you choose to install.
You can find the material libraries from the Tool Palettes Window (choose Tools➪
Palettes➪Tool Palettes) by right-clicking the title bar when the palette isn’t docked or
the double grip bar at the top when it is docked. Select either Materials or Materials
Library from the contextual menu to display palettes that contain material tools.
The Materials tool palette group on the Tool Palettes Window contains some basic
materials that you might use on your 3D models, whereas the Materials Library palette
group (see Figure 17-7) contains a larger number of materials that you can attach to 3D
objects in your 3D models. To attach a material, click one of the tools or click a tab to
switch between the available tool palettes in the selected group to select a different
Figure 17-6:

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

material. The material is added to the drawing and you’re prompted to select the
object you want to attach the material to. For more information on attaching materials,
see the section “Attaching and Removing Materials,” later in this chapter. 
You can create your own material tools on tool palettes if you want to reuse a material
in other drawings. To reuse a material in another drawing, drag the preview swatch in
the Materials palette to a tool palette on the Tool Palettes Window and drop the image
when the black horizontal bar is displayed. For more information about customizing
tool pallets, see the topic Tool Palettes in the AutoCAD help system. To locate the
topic, display the Online Help system and click the Contents tab. On the Contents tab,
choose User’s Guide➪The User Interface.
Attaching and Removing Materials
Materials by themselves aren’t any good until you attach them to an object in your 3D
model. You can attach a material in three different ways: by layer, directly to an object,
or to a surface on a 3D solid. Attaching materials to the layers is by far one of the easi-
est and quickest ways to attach materials to objects in your 3D models. However, using
the layer approach to attach materials takes some up-front planning on your part. All
objects on one layer receive the same material, so if you have different objects on one
layer, you either have to create a new layer or directly attach a material to the objects
that need a different material assigned to them.
To attach a material to a layer, use the MATERIALATTACH command or click the Attach
by Layer button on the Materials control panel of the Dashboard palette. The Material
Attachment Options dialog box (see Figure 17-8) opens. In the dialog box, drag a mate-
rial from the left side to the layer you want to assign the material to on the right side.
To remove the materials, click the Detach icon next to the layer and material pairing
on the right side of the dialog box.
If you didn’t give each object that requires a different material a layer, you can assign
materials directly to individual objects. To assign a material to an object, display 
the Materials palette and then select the material you want to attach under the
Available Materials in Drawing category. Then click the Apply Material to Object.
Clicking Apply Material to Object starts the MATERIALASSIGN command and changes
the crosshairs to a pick box with a paintbrush (see Figure 17-9). Select the object that
you want to attach the material to.

Chapter 17: Materials

If your 3D model is created from 3D solids, you can assign a material to a specific face of
a 3D solid. For example, you might have a 3D solid that has a metal material attached to
it but you want to show a sticker material on a specific face. To assign the sticker mate-
rial to a face, hold down the Ctrl key and select the face of the 3D solid you want to
attach the material to. You can also use the Face option of the SOLIDEDIT command to
assign a material by its name to a face of a 3D solid. (I cover the SOLIDEDIT command in
Chapter 9.)

You can use the MATCHPROP command to assign a material to an object by using an
existing object in the drawing that already has a material assigned to it. For more infor-
mation on the MATCHPROP command, choose Modify➪Match Properties and then
press F1 when the command is started.

To remove materials from 3D objects or faces, click Remove Materials from Selected
Objects on the Materials palette. When prompted to select objects, select the 3D
objects that you want to remove materials from. The materials are removed from both
3D objects and individual faces on a 3D solid, so if you’ve assigned material to a face,
it’s also removed. 
Materials can exist in a drawing even if they are not applied to a 3D object or face. In
order to remove a material completely from a drawing, select a material in the Material
Editor and click Purge from Drawing, or use the PURGE command.
Exercise 17-2: Attaching Materials to 3D Objects
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise17-2.dwg from the Chapter 17
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice attach-
ing materials to objects and faces in the drawing.
1. Display the Dashboard and select Realistic from the Visual Styles drop-down list
under the Visual Styles control panel.
The viewport looks similar to Figure 17-10.
2. Display the Materials palette.
3. Select the Glass material preview and click Apply Material to Object.
4. At the Select objects: prompt, select the sphere in the drawing and press
Enter.
The sphere now appears transparent. 
5. Select the Wood material preview and click Apply Material to Object.
6. At the Select objects: prompt, hold down the Ctrl key and select the face
that’s below the sphere.
You might have to move the pick box near the 3D solid to get it to highlight first
and then hold down the Ctrl key to select the face. AutoCAD can sometimes be
picky about how you select the face. The top of the chamfered box now has a
wood grain assigned to it.
7. Display the Dashboard if it’s closed and click the Attach by Layer button on the
Materials control panel.
8. In the Material Attachment Options dialog box, drag the Mirror material from the
left side to the Mirror layer on the right. Do the same with the White material,
except drop it on Label layer 0. Click OK.

Chapter 17: Materials

9. Close the Materials and Dashboard palettes to see what the viewport looks like
now. You really don’t see all the materials to their true potential because
AutoCAD can’t produce some of the effects that materials make directly in the
viewport.
10. Choose View➪Render➪Render.
The Render Window is displayed and shows what the objects look like after the
materials have been attached (see Figure 17-11).
11. Save the drawing with the name Completed17-2.dwg to the Chapter 17 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Adjusting Materials
Materials can have repeating patterns such as ceramic tiles or grain in a wood mate-
rial. The direction in which these materials run most likely is important in your render-
ing. When you attach a material, AutoCAD places it on the object based on the object’s
UVW coordinates — even if sometimes, the placement feels completely random. If you
don’t like how AutoCAD places the material, the MATERIALMAP command rotates and
repositions a material on a 3D object or the face of a 3D solid. Start the MATERIALMAP
command from the Mapping flyout on the Materials control panel or click one of the
options from the Mapping submenu under View➪Render.
When you’ve started the MATERIALMAP command, you’re prompted to do one of
three things: 
 Choose one of the four mapping gizmos. The four gizmo options that you can
choose are box, planar, spherical, and cylindrical shaped. The shape of the gizmo
that you choose depends on the type of object you select and how you want the
material to wrap. After you assign the gizmo, you can move or rotate it to change
the mapping coordinates for the 3D object or face. 
 Copy a mapping. You can copy the mapping coordinates from one 3D object or
face to another one so you don’t have to move or rotate the mapping over again
on other objects.
 Reset the material mapping for the 3D object or face. You can also reset the
mapping coordinates, which undoes any moving or rotating of the mapping
gizmo. Figure 17-12 shows a hardwood flooring material rotated 45 degrees. The
left image shows the material before it was rotated 45 degrees, and the image on
the right shows the material after it was rotated.

For more information on mapping materials, see the topic Adjust Mapping on Objects
and Faces in the AutoCAD help system. To locate the topic, display the Online Help
system and click the Contents tab. On the Contents tab, choose User’s Guide➪Create
Realistic Images and Graphics➪Materials and Textures.
Exercise 17-3: Controlling the Direction of a Material
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise17-3.dwg from the Chapter 17
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice rotating
a material.
1. Choose View➪Render➪Mapping➪Planar Mapping.
2. At the Select faces or objects: prompt, hold down the Ctrl key, select the face
with the wood material attached to it, and press Enter to end selecting objects.
You might have to move the pick box near the 3D solid to get it to highlight first
and then hold down the Ctrl key to select the face. AutoCAD is sometimes picky
about how you select the face.
3. At the Accept the mapping or [Move/Rotate/reseT/sWitch mapping
mode]: prompt, enter R and press Enter.
The same gizmo that’s used for the 3DROTATE command is displayed.
4. Position the cursor over the blue ribbon on the gizmo and click when it turns
yellow.
The gizmo is now locked to rotate along the Z axis.
5. As you move the crosshairs and the material starts rotating on the surface, enter
45 and press Enter twice to rotate the material 45 degrees.
6. Choose View➪Render➪Render.
The Render Window is displayed and shows what the rotated material looks like
(see Figure 17-13). Compare it to Figure 17-11, which shows the material without
any rotation. 
7. Save the drawing with the name Completed17-3.dwg to the Chapter 17 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Chapter 17: Materials

Converting Old Materials
You save materials created in AutoCAD 2008 in a different format from the ones created
in AutoCAD 2006 and prior. If you have a drawing that contains old materials and want
to use them, you must use the CONVERTOLDMATERIALS command to change all the
old materials in the drawing to the new type so you can access them from the Materials
palette assigned to objects. If you don’t convert the old materials, they won’t be applied
during rendering or shown with the Realistic visual style. If old materials are found and
converted in the drawing, the number of materials that were converted is displayed in
the AutoCAD Text Window. For example, the message 6 materials(s) converted.
indicates that six old materials were converted in the drawing. 
Because the CONVERTOLDMATERIALS command can be a task in itself, you 
can have AutoCAD update old materials automatically for you. Set the system 
variable 3DCONVERSIONMODE to a value of 1, which is the default value. If you set
3DCONVERSIONMODE to 0, you disable the automatic conversion of old materials. 
Set the value of 2, which prompts you when old materials are available for converting.
The 3DCONVERSIONMODE system variable also affects the conversion of old lights in
drawings created in AutoCAD 2006 and prior. To find out more about converting old
lights, see Chapter 16.

Rendering and Animating
In This Chapter
 Rendering a 3D model
 Using render presets
 Using advanced rendering settings
 Creating an animation
T
o generate a rendering of your 3D model, you don’t need user-defined lighting or materi-
als, but without those two elements, you won’t generate realistic renderings of your 3D
models. After adding user-defined lights and materials, you can create a rendering of the 3D
model that you can easily save and e-mail or post on an extranet site. (An extranet is a Web
site that is set up specifically for the client to access and view the progress of a project; the
site is commonly protected by a password to make sure only authorized people have access
to it.) AutoCAD tries to make rendering as easy as possible by hiding all the settings from
you by using render presets. Render presets are a named collection of rendering settings
that allow you to quickly create a rendering, but you can also work with the rendering set-
tings directly to manipulate the rendered output.
Along with generating an image file, you can generate a basic walk-through or walk-around
animation. The animation can help the client see all sides of a 3D model to get a better under-
standing of what it looks like and its scale. The animation capabilities that AutoCAD offers
are somewhat limited, but they’re better than no animation capabilities at all.
The exercises in this chapter show you how to create a rendering of your 3D model using dif-
ferent techniques.
Rendering Your 3D Model
The Render Window (see Figure 18-1) is the default location where AutoCAD renders the cur-
rent view of your 3D model. The Render Window is displayed when you start the RENDER
command, but you can also display it using the RENDERWIN command or by clicking Show
Render Window when the Render control panel is expanded.
The Render Window gives you visual feedback about the current progress of the image: 
 See the render. The Image pane is in the upper-left corner and displays the most
recently rendered image. 
 Look at the history. The History pane is located below the Image pane and allows you
to view the other rendered images that you recently created. You can right-click and
choose to render an image again, save a rendering to a file, remove the rendering from
the history list, or simply delete the temporary file and remove the entry from the list.

The History pane gives you some information about how long the rendering
took, the rendering preset used, the view rendered, the output size of the image
rendered, and the name of the temporary file that AutoCAD created for the ren-
dering. The temporary files that are created for each rendering are saved to the
Temp folder of Windows.
 Check the progress or cancel the render. Between the Image and History panes
are the Cancel Rendering button and the progress bar for the current rendering
in progress. If you click Cancel Rendering when a rendering is in progress, the
rendering is aborted. You can also see the current progress of a rendering from
the Render control panel on the Dashboard, as well as abort the current render-
ing in progress.
 Look into the statistics of a render. On the right side of the Render Window is the
Statistics pane, which gives you information about the settings used to create the
rendering. These settings are stored in a render preset and can be changed with
the Render Presets Manager dialog box or the Advanced Render Settings palette.
I cover the Render Presets Manager dialog box later, in the section “Rendering 
with Presets,” and I cover the Advanced Render Settings palette later, in the 
section “Rendering with Advanced Settings.”
Cropping before a render
Rendering can take a while when you’re working with complex 3D models that have a
lot of materials attached to them and use a large number of user-defined lights. One of
the things that you can do to help make rendering faster is to render only the part of
the drawing window that you want to test your material or lighting changes in.

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

To render only a portion of the current viewport, use the RENDERCROP command.
Click Render Cropped Region on the Render control panel or select Crop from the
Procedure setting in the Advanced Render Settings palette before starting the RENDER
command. Figure 18-2 shows a region of the current viewport rendered right in the
drawing window, but the remaining part of the 3D model is left in the current visual
style.
Saving a rendering
You can save renderings in a number of different file formats. Based on whether you
created the rendering through the Render Window or the current viewport, you follow
slightly different processes to save the rendered image to file. 
When rendering to the Render Window, you right-click the temporary file in the
History pane and choose Save. You give the rendering a name and specify a location.
If you want to save a rendering from the current viewport, you have to use a screen-
capture tool like SnagIt by TechSmith (www.techsmith.com) or the Print Screen fea-
ture that comes with Windows to get an image of the viewport. SnagIt offers a variety
of screen-capture options and image-editing tools, but the Windows Print Screen fea-
ture is very basic. To create a print screen with Windows, press the Print Scrn (or Print
Screen) key. An image is created and placed on the Windows Clipboard, which allows
you to paste it into another application (such as Paint). 
Pressing the Print Scrn (or Print Screen) key by itself captures the whole Windows
desktop, whereas holding down the Alt key while pressing the Print Scrn (or Print
Screen) key captures the active application. 
The cropped area is rendered.
The uncropped area remains unrendered.

Exercise 18-1: Creating a Rendering and Saving It to an Image File
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise18-1.dwg from the Chapter 18
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a rendering of a 3D model and then save the rendered image to file.
1. Display the Dashboard if it isn’t already displayed.
2. On the Render control panel, click Render.
3. In the Render window, right-click the Exercise18-1-Temp000 entry in the History
pane. From the shortcut menu, choose Save.
The last three numbers at the end of the file might be different based on the
number of temporary rendered images you have created.
4. In the Render Output File dialog box, enter Completed18-1 in the File Name text
box and select PNG(*.png) from the Files of Type drop-down list.
5. Browse to the Chapter 18 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder and click Save.
6. In the PNG Image Options dialog box, select 24 Bits (16.7 Million Colors) and 
deselect the Progressive check box. Click OK.
You return to the Render window. Notice that the icon for the temporary image
file and its filename are changed to indicate that you saved the temporary file
with a different name.
7. Close the Render window by clicking the X in the upper-right corner.
8. Browse to the Chapter 18 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder and double-
click the Completed18-1.png file to view it the default application set up to
view PNG files.
The rendered image looks similar to Figure 18-3.
9. Close the drawing Completed18-1.dwg without saving any changes.
Rendering with Presets
Prior to AutoCAD 2007, the rendering options were up front and center and often
tempted you to click them in an attempt to find the perfect combination of settings to
make a rendering look great. The set of scary rendering options is in the past since

Part V: Visualizing the Design 

Autodesk introduced render presets, which help simplify the rendering process.
AutoCAD comes with five standard render presets that range from creating quick and
low-quality renderings to high-quality renderings that are used for presentations.
Whenever you create a rendering, no matter whether the renderings destination is the
Render window or the current viewport, you specify a render preset. The render preset
tells AutoCAD which setting to use during rendering. To change the current render
preset, you select one of the render presets from the Render Presets drop-down list on
the Render control panel or from the Render Presets drop-down list on the Advanced
Render Settings palette. Although the render presets that come with AutoCAD are great
for most renderings, you can also create your own render presets by using the Render
Presets Manager dialog box (see Figure 18-4). To display the Render Presets Manager
dialog box, use the RENDERPRESETS command or select Manage Render Presets from
the Render Presets drop-down list on the Render control panel.
The Render Presets tree view on the left side of the Render Presets Manager dialog box
allows you to select which render preset you want to view. You can work with the cur-
rent rendering settings, view one of the standard render presets, or create a custom
render preset. AutoCAD doesn’t allow you to modify any of the standard render pre-
sets, but you can create your own custom render preset based on one of the standard
render presets. 
For more information on the rendering settings in the Render Presets Manager dialog
box, see the topic RENDERPRESETS in the AutoCAD help system. To locate the topic,
display the Online Help system and click the Contents tab. On the Contents tab,
choose Command Reference➪Commands➪R Commands.
You can’t export or import render presets, but if you want to add a specific render
preset to a drawing, add it to a Drawing Template (DWT) file. 
Exercise 18-2: Creating and Using a Render Preset
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise18-2.dwg from the Chapter 18
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a custom render preset and using it to create a rendering.
1. Display the Dashboard if it isn’t already displayed.
2. On the Render control panel, select Manage Render Presets from the Render
Presets drop-down list.
3. In the Render Presets Manager dialog box, select Low under the Standard Render
Presets in the Render Presets tree on the left side.

4. Click Create Copy.
5. In the Copy Render Preset dialog box, replace the text in the Name text box with
Quick Render and click OK.
6. In the middle of the dialog box, click the vertical scroll bar to find the Shadows
category. Click the lightbulb icon in the header of the Shadows category to dis-
able the creation of shadows during rendering. 
7. Use the scroll bar again and scroll all the way to the bottom. Click the Tile Order
setting and then select Spiral from the drop-down list that’s displayed.
8. Click Set Current to set the new render preset current and then click OK to exit
the dialog box.
9. Create a rendering of the current view.
This time the rendering process starts in the center and works its way out. The
quality of the image is much lower and doesn’t have any shadows, which makes
it quick to render but not very pretty to look at. The image that’s created looks
similar to the center image in Figure 18-5. The leftmost image is rendered with
the Medium render preset, whereas the one on the right was rendered with the
Presentation render preset.
10. Save the drawing with the name Completed18-2.dwg to the Chapter 18 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

In Exercise 18-2, you created a new render preset and used it to create a rendering of the 3D
model. To choose a different render preset, open the _______________ control panel and select
one from the _______________ drop-down list.
Rendering with Advanced Settings
For the most part, the render presets AutoCAD provides for you are all you need. But if
you want additional control over the rendering settings and how the final rendering
looks, you should check out the advanced rendering features that allow you to
improve the way your renderings look. These rendering features allow you to add fog
and depth cueing to a rendering and to use advanced techniques such as Ray Tracing
and Indirect Lighting. 
Render Environment
The Render Environment dialog box (see Figure 18-6) allows you to add fog and depth
cueing to your renderings to give the viewer a sense of distance. You display the Render
Environment dialog box with the RENDERENVIRONMENT command or by clicking the

Render Environment button on the Render control panel on the Dashboard palette
when it is expanded. To define fog or depth cueing, you specify a near and far distance
with a percentage of opacity for the fog/depth cueing. The near and far distances are
defined by a percentage from the Front Clipping Plane defined for the current view (or
camera) towards the Back Clipping Plane. You can adjust the clipping planes by using
either the View Manager dialog box when you’re using a named view or the 3DCLIP
command.
You can apply fog and depth cueing to the background in addition to the 3D objects in
the drawing, which you normally need to do; otherwise, things look a little strange
based on how your 3D model is being viewed. Figure 18-7 shows a rendering before
and after depth cueing is added.
Exercise 18-3: Adding Depth Cueing to a Rendering
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise18-3.dwg from the Chapter 18 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice changing the
clipping planes of a named view and add depth cueing to a rendering of a 3D model.
1. Choose View➪Named Views to display the View Manager.
2. Select Render under the Model Views node in the Views tree.
3. In the middle of the dialog box, scroll to the bottom listing of available proper-
ties for the named view.
4. Under the Clipping category, enter a value of 10 for the Front Plane property and
a value of -10 for the Back Plane property. Select Front and Back On from the
drop-down list for the Clipping property.

9. Select the Color property and choose Select Color from the drop-down list.
10. In the Select Color dialog box, click the True Color tab and enter 0,0,0 in the
Color text box at the bottom of the dialog box. Click OK.
11. Select the Far Distance property and enter 50 in the text box next to the property.
12. Select the Far Fog Percentage property and enter 65 in the text box next to the
property.
13. Click OK to exit the Render Environment dialog box.
14. Render the drawing with the Medium render preset.
The rendered results looks like the image on the right in Figure 18-7. 
15. Save the drawing with the name Completed18-1.dwg to the Chapter 18 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.
Advanced Render Settings
The Render Presets Manager dialog box allows you to create custom render presets
based on the values you want to use for the available rendering settings. However, you
might at times want to change settings on the fly for unique situations or testing set-
tings instead of creating a new render preset, or you might want to change the current
context in which the rendering is created. The Advanced Render Settings palette (see
Figure 18-8) allows you to change rendering settings and specify where the current ren-
dering should be created or the file format that a rendering should be saved to. To dis-
play the Advanced Render Settings palette, use the RPREF command or click Advanced
Render Settings on the Render control panel when it’s expanded. For the most part, the
Advanced Render Settings palette is a cross between some of the options found on the
Render control panel and the Render Presets Manager dialog box.
Figure 18-8:

294
Part V: Visualizing the Design 

At the top of the Advanced Render Settings palette, you can choose a render preset or
you can open the Render Presets Manager dialog box by selecting Manage Render
Presets from the Render Presets drop-down list. The area that’s different between the
Render Presets Manager dialog box and the Advanced Render Settings palette is the
Render Context category; otherwise, all the options are the same as those in the
middle section of the Render Presets Manager dialog box. Here are the options to look
at in the dialog box:
 Procedure: Select what you want to render. The procedures that you can choose
are View (renders the current view in the drawing), Crop (starts the RENDERCROP
command), and Selected (renders only the objects you select in the drawing
window). 
 Destination: Specify whether to use the Render Window or the current viewport
(the Viewport option) to create the rendering. If you select Crop from the
Procedures drop-down list, the only option you have for the Destination setting
is Viewport; otherwise, both Window and Viewport are available.
 Output File Name: You see this setting only if you render to the Render window
and click the Save File button located on the right side of the Render Context cat-
egory header. Choose the default filename and file format that are used when a
rendering is created. Each time a rendering is created, the most recent file is
overwritten. Rendering to a file using this option is a nice safety net just in case
AutoCAD crashes or you forget to save the last rendered image before you close
AutoCAD. 
 Output Size: Choose the size of the image that is created during rendering.
Based on how the rendering will be used (on the Internet or in a printed
brochure or flyer), you might need to adjust the size of the image that is created.
AutoCAD defines four standard output sizes (320 x 240, 640 x 480, 800 x 600, and
1,024 x 768), but you can specify a custom image size by using the Output Size
dialog box (see Figure 18-9), which you display by selecting Specify Output Size
from the Output Size drop-down list. You can also specify the output filename
and size for a rendered image by using the set of controls at the bottom of the
Render control panel when it’s expanded. 
The final options deal with the Render Exposure feature, which I cover in Chapter 16.
When you select Automatic from the Exposure Type setting, AutoCAD determines the
render exposure to use, but the settings that are set using the Render Exposure dialog
box are used when Exposure Type is set to Logarithmic. The Physical Scale setting
controls the scale factor applied to the values specified in the Adjust Render Exposure
dialog box or the sliders on the Lights control panel when it’s expanded.
For more information on the other advanced settings in the Advanced Render Settings
palette, see the topic Advanced Render Settings Palette in the AutoCAD help system.
To display the topic, display the Advanced Render Settings palette and press F1 when
the palette has focus.

Chapter 18: Rendering and Animating

Setting Your Model in Motion
Renderings are a great way of showing how a design concept looks if it was built or
manufactured, but they’re still flat images of a 3D model. Although it isn’t possible to
pull your 3D model out of the screen into the real world (it would be great if you could,
though) and allow your client to rotate it to see multiple points of view, you can opt for
the next best thing. Animations in AutoCAD give you the ability to take your client on a
visual tour of a 3D model or an assembly of parts. Although you can’t really animate
parts in motion, creating an animation from a camera rotating around a 3D model can
help add something to a presentation and close the bid on a project. If you want to 
animate individual parts for animations that show an assembly coming together or
explode a part to show how it goes together, you need a program like Autodesk Viz or
3ds Max. To find out more about Autodesk Viz or 3ds Max, visit Autodesk’s Web site at
www.autodesk.com.
To create an animation in AutoCAD, use the ANIPATH command or choose View➪
Motion Path Animations to open the Motion Path Animation dialog box (see Fig-
ure 18-10). The Motion Path Animation dialog box allows you to control the motion of 
a camera around or through a 3D model. You designate whether the camera for the
animation should follow a path or lock to a fixed point. The path can be a line, a circle,
an arc, a 2D or 3D polyline, a spline, an ellipse, or an elliptical arc. You also specify how
the target for the animation should be defined by using either a path or point. You can
use only a point for the camera or target, but not both. Exercise 18-4 shows how to
create an animation with the Motion Path Animation dialog box.
You then specify the settings for the animation that is generated. On the right side of
the Motion Path Animation dialog box, you specify the number of frames per second,
the length of the animation, visual style to be used, the size and format of the anima-
tion file to be created, whether the animation is slowed down when the camera is
rounding a corner to make sure the animation appears smooth, and whether you want
to reverse the direction that the animation is created in.
In addition to the Motion Path Animation dialog box, you can create an animation 
by using the controls on the 3D Navigate control panel when it’s expanded (see 
Figure 18-11). Here’s how you use the controls on the 3D Navigate control panel:
 Record: You start by using 3DWALK, 3DFLY, or another 3D navigation command
and then click Start Recording Animation. 
 Save: Click Save Animation.

I
n the previous chapters of Part V, you find out how to create and modify lights and materi-
als, along with how to create rendered images and animations. The exercises in this chap-
ter build on the 3D modeling and navigation exercises from Chapters 7, 11, and 15. During the
exercises in this chapter, you add lights and materials to the 3D model. Then you add some
depth cueing and create a presentation-quality rendering that you save to a file. 
The drawing that you work with uses the drawings that you created in Chapters 11 and 15. 
A planar surface has been created below the rear assembly of the custom motorcycle. The
planar surface will be used to receive shadows and light. Some materials have already been
defined for you and attached to some of the layers that the 3D objects are on. Figure 19-1
shows the rear assembly of the custom motorcycle that you will work with.

Lighting the Way
In this exercise, you add lights to the 3D model to give it a splash of realism. You add a point
light, spotlight, and distant light to the 3D model. The spotlight is positioned at an angle
almost directly above the model; the point light adds some lighting from inside of the rim of
the model. The distant light brings some overall fill light to the entire rendering.

reating 3D models is great for showing design con-
cepts as well as detecting any possible issues with a
design before a prototype is ever created. However,
because of the way collaboration on designs works these
days, you must be able to share your designs electroni-
cally and in hardcopy formats with others. AutoCAD
allows you to exchange 3D models in many different for-
mats that non-CAD and CAD users can accept to keep
using the information that you generated downstream.
You can plot 3D models in many different ways, just like
you can 2D drawings. When you plot a drawing, typically
it’s to paper, but you can also plot to electronic file 
formats.

Plotting to a Hardcopy 
or an Electronic File

A
lthough you do live in the digital age, it’s certainly not the paper-free utopia that many
thought it would be with the birth of the Internet and e-mail. Paper still rules the roost
when it comes to business transactions for the most part. Now with design software, the
world has embraced sending files electronically, and people are working electronically a
little more and more each year, but paper still plays an intricate part in a final design. When
you want to share your 3D model with someone, you have two choices: keep them elec-
tronic (which the trees would be happy about) or create a hardcopy (print a drawing on a
sheet of paper).
No matter whether you decide to keep your design in an electronic format or create a hard-
copy, you are either plotting or publishing your design in some form to share it with others.
Plotting or publishing your models gives you better protection of your files if you need to
keep the original drawing files out of the hands of individuals outside your company. You can
also exchange Drawing (DWG) files with AutoCAD users or other applications. I cover
exchanging DWG files with users of other software programs in Chapter 21.
Plotters and Plot Styles
Many things affect how you create an electronic representation of a 3D model or a hardcopy.
The two things that affect the way a drawing file is output the most are plot styles and plot-
ters. If a viewport has either the 3D Wireframe or 2D Wireframe visual style applied, the
edges of 3D objects are affected by the plot style associated with the layout or the one
selected during plotting. (Plot styles don’t impact the way 3D models are plotted to an elec-
tronic file or hardcopy when they’re displayed in a viewport with one of the standard 3D
visual styles — 3D Hidden, Conceptual, and Realistic.) Plotters are the devices that produce
output with the Plot or Publish dialog boxes to create an electronic file or a hardcopy.
Plotters
Plotters control the output your 3D model is plotted to. A plotter can represent a system
printer that’s configured through Windows or a non-system printer. The settings for a non-
system printer are stored in a plot configuration file. The plot configuration file represents

either a physical or virtual device that instructs AutoCAD about how to handle plotted
output. Plot configuration settings are stored in files with the extension PC3 and are
stored in the Plotters folder. (To locate the Plotters folder on your computer, open the
Options dialog box and click the Files tab. Expand the Printer Support File Path node
and then expand the Printer Configuration Search Path node. You can also choose
File➪Plotter Manager, which opens the folder that the plotter configuration files are
stored in.)
A physical device is some sort of output machine like a laser jet printer or large format
plotter that’s connected directly to your computer or available from a network; a virtual
device is a piece of software that runs on your computer and converts plotted output
from AutoCAD to an electronic file. You create DWF, PDF, and PLT files by using virtual
devices. Each PC3 file that you configure in AutoCAD works with one and only one plot-
ter or file format at a time. AutoCAD ships five PC3 files out of the box, and for the most
part, they’re all virtual devices with the exception of the Default Windows System
Printer.pc3 file, which is a special PC3 file that acts like a chameleon: It can repre-
sent either a physical or virtual device because it simply sends plot information to
whatever the default Windows printer is that’s currently configured on your computer.
To create a new PC3 file, you use the Add-A-Plotter Wizard shortcut in the Plotters folder.
(You can access the Plotters folder from AutoCAD by choosing File➪Plotter Manager.)
When the Add Plotter Wizard is started, you can configure a new plotter that is con-
nected to your computer or located on the network. If you configure a plotter on your
computer, you have the ability to create PC3 files that output to DWF, PDF, DXB, and
some common raster image file formats. Being able to plot directly to an electronic file
makes your files secure by not allowing someone the ability to alter the original file, but
you can also share then with non-CAD users. I cover other ways of creating raster image
in Chapter 21.
Exercise 20-1: Creating a Raster Image Plotter and Plotting to an Image File
In this exercise, you create a PC3 file that will allow you to plot directly to a Windows
Bitmap (BMP) file.
1. Choose File➪Plotter Manager.
2. In the Plotters folder, double click the shortcut Add-A-Plotter Wizard.
3. In the Add Plotter Wizard, click Next at the Introduction Page.
4. On the Begin page, select My Computer and click Next.
5. On the Plotter Model page, select Raster File Formats from the Manufactures list
and then MS-Windows BMP (Uncompressed DIB) from the Models list. Click Next.
6. On the Import Pcp or Pc2 page, click Next.
PCP files are similar to the PC3 files except they were used with AutoCAD R12
and R13, whereas PC2 files were used with AutoCAD R14.
7. On the Ports page, make sure Plot to File is selected and then click Next.
8. On the Plotter Name page, replace the name in the Plotter Name text box with
BMP File and then click Next.
9. On the Finish page, click Finish.
If you want to, you can click Edit Plotter Configuration to access the custom
properties that are available for the device.

Part VI: Model Interchange 

Plot styles
Plot styles aren’t really useful when you’re plotting or publishing 3D models because
often you plot a viewport that’s displayed with a 3D visual style (3D Hidden, Concep-
tual, or Realistic) or one that has been rendered. However, if you have a combination
of viewports that are set up to display 2D and 3D visual styles, you control the way 2D
objects appear with a plot style. In the case of 2D objects, you can use plot styles to
change color, linetype, and lineweight for the linework in your drawing. When you
create a new drawing, you designate the type of plot style you want to use when plot-
ting. AutoCAD supports two different types of plot styles:
 Color-dependent: These plot styles allow you to assign a different color, line-
type, and lineweight based on the color an object is assigned directly or through
the layer it is on. Color-dependent plot styles are stored in CTB files.
Color-dependent plot style is the more popular of the two plot styles, most likely
because it’s the older of the two. The other reason why color-dependent plot
styles are more popular is that dimensions and tables don’t fully support named
plot styles.
 Named: These plot styles use names to organize settings like color, linetype, and
lineweight that are used when plotting objects. Named plot styles aren’t auto-
matically assigned to layers or objects like color-dependent plot styles are, so
you must select the named plot style that you want a layer to use when a draw-
ing is plotted or assign a named plot style directly to objects in your drawing.
Named plot styles are stored in files with the extension STB. 
Plot styles are stored in the Plot Styles folder. To locate the Plot Styles folder on your
computer, open the Options dialog box and click the Files tab. Expand the Printer
Support File Path node and then expand the Plot Style Table Search Path node.
If you want to convert a drawing that uses color-dependent plot styles to one that uses
named plot styles, you use the CONVERTPSTYLES command (which is available only
at the command prompt).
For more information about how to create and use plot styles, see the topic Use Plot
Styles to Control Plotted Objects in AutoCAD’s Online Help system. To locate the topic,
click the Contents tab and then choose User’s Guide➪Plot and Publish Drawings➪
Plot Drawings➪Control How Objects Are Plotted➪Use Plot Styles to Control Plotted
Objects.
Laying Out Models
AutoCAD drawings contain two different locations that you can plot from: Model Space
and Paper Space. Model Space is defined by the Model tab at the bottom of the draw-
ing window or the Model button on the status bar when tabs aren’t displayed. You do

all of your modeling on the Model tab; plotting is usually handled from the layout tabs.
All the tabs in the drawing other than Model represent Paper Space that organizes how
your drawing will be plotted (which is why it’s called Paper Space). To lay out your
model on the layout tabs, you use floating viewports that allow you to see portions of
the model that are contained on the Model tab.
To display the Model and layout tabs on the status bar instead of at the bottom of the
drawing window, right-click a tab and select Hide Layout and Model Tabs. To redisplay
the Model and layout tabs, right-click the Model and layout buttons on the status bar
and select Display Layout and Model Tabs.
Layouts
You create layouts to organize different views of the model in Model space. Layouts are
named objects that contain various settings that control how the objects on the layout
and the views of the model are displayed in the viewports when plotted. Typically, a
layout contains a title block, some text and dimensions, and objects called floating
viewports. (I cover floating viewports later in this chapter.) The title block contains
drawing and project-related information that helps organize books of drawings into
sheet sets, which helps manufacture or assemble the manufactured parts.
In addition to holding graphical objects, layouts organize nongraphical information
that tells AutoCAD how the layout tab should be plotted through the use of a page
setup. A page setup contains all the settings required to plot or publish a layout such
as the plotter, paper size, plot scale, plot style, and many other settings. The Page
Setup Manager dialog box is used to create and edit the page setups. Page Setups
make it easy to control how different layouts are plotted, instead of having to change
the settings each time you plot. To display the Page Setup Manager dialog box, use the
PAGESETUP command or choose File➪Page Setup Manager. To find out more about
page setups, display the Page Setup Manager dialog box and click the Help button.
To create a new layout in a drawing, you can create one from scratch, copy an existing
one, use a wizard, or import one from an existing drawing file. If you have Drawing
Template (DWT) files that you already use with predefined layers, dimension styles,
text styles, and other formatting settings, consider creating a DWT file that contains all
your formatting and layouts or just your layouts so you can import them into a draw-
ing as needed.
When you import a layout, you import the page setup settings and graphical objects
that are on that layout. The LAYOUT command creates a layout from scratch or
imports one from an existing file, while the LAYOUTWIZARD command allows you to
create a layout using the Layout Wizard. Choose Insert➪Layout and then select one of
these options.
Exercise 20-2: Creating a New Layout by Using the Layout Wizard
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise20-2.dwg from the Chapter 20

Floating viewports
Floating viewports are the portals (or windows) into Model Space that allow you to see
your model from a layout. AutoCAD usually creates a single floating viewport, but you
can have more than one viewport on a layout (refer to Exercise 20-2) when you use 
the Layout Wizard to create a new layout. To create floating viewports, you use the
–VPORTS command or choose View➪Viewpoints and select one of the options when a
layout is active.
The –VPORTS command allows you to do the following:
 Turn a viewport on or off to display the objects from Model Space in it.
 Create between one to four viewports based on a specified area and an arrange-
ment of how the area should be divided up.
 Control the visual style that a viewport should use to display the objects from
Model Space with.
 Lock a viewport so you don’t accidentally pan or zoom in the viewport, resulting
in the view changing.
 You can clip a floating viewport so you see only a portion of the objects from
Model Space. This causes the viewport to appear irregular in shape instead of
rectangular like it does by default.
 Create an irregular-shaped viewport using a closed object such as a circle,
ellipse, or 2D polyline.
 Create floating viewports based on a named confirmation of tiled viewports cre-
ated on the Model tab.
 You can reset the layer property overrides for selected viewports to their default
values.
After viewports are created, you can modify them by using grips, the Properties
palette, and the Layer Properties Manager dialog box. Grips are handy to resize a float-
ing viewport, but the Properties palette allows you to lock a floating viewport and
adjust the scale to display the objects from Model Space, set the visual style to use
during plotting, and change a few other settings. The Layer Properties Manager allows
you to set property overrides for layers that are displayed in the viewport and freeze
layers so they appear in one viewport but not in another, allowing you to control the
visibility of 2D and 3D objects based on the layers that they are on.

click the Contents tab and then choose User’s Guide➪Choose a Work Process Before
You Begin➪Create Multiple-View Drawing Layouts (Paper Space).
Exercise 20-3: Creating a Single Viewport and Modifying Its Properties
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise20-3.dwg from the Chapter 20
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice adjust-
ing viewports.
1. Select the four viewports and display the Properties palette. From the Properties
palette, select 1:1 from the Standard Scale property to set the scale for the
objects in the viewports.
You can also adjust the scale of a viewport by selecting the viewport and then
using the VP Scale list on the application or drawing status bar.
2. Double-click inside the border of the viewport in the upper-left to enter Model
Space. In Model Space, pan until the 3D model is centered.
Be sure not to zoom in the viewport; otherwise, you have to set the scale back 
to 1:1.
3. Click in the other viewports and center the 3D model in those, too.
4. Double-click outside the viewport to return to Paper Space.
5. Select one of the viewports and adjust its size by using grips.
Adjust all of the viewports so they look like those in Figure 20-3.

6. Select each viewport and right-click. From the shortcut menu, choose 
Display Locked➪Yes.
Locking the display of a viewport keeps you from accidentally changing the view
within a viewport.
7. Save the drawing with the name Completed20-3.dwg to the Chapter 20 folder
in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents and close the drawing.

Chapter 20: Plotting to a Hardcopy or an Electronic File

Plotting and Publishing
Drawing files from AutoCAD are plotted, not printed. Hardcopies are created using a
device called a plotter (printer). In the past, plotters were similar to an inkjet printer, as
they utilized ink cartridges or pens. These days, plotters are much more like a laser jet
printer because they use toner, which is much more efficient than ink cartridges. Both
the plotters of today and past use rolls of paper in various widths instead of trays of
paper. AutoCAD offers two different features that have the same goal in mind: plotting
and publishing (outputting to an electronic file and creating a hardcopy for sharing
with others, respectively).
Plotting
You can create an electronic representation of the objects in a drawing or create a
hardcopy of a drawing. To do so, you use the PLOT command (choose File➪Plot). You
typically plot a drawing to share it with others who don’t have access to the design
files. When you plot a drawing file, you designate the device to use to create the
output. You select the device from the Name drop-down list under the Printer/Plotter
section of the Plot dialog box. The devices that you can choose are either system
printers (Windows) or non-system printers (AutoCAD and the Add Plotter Wizard).
Non-system printers are defined by PC3 files, which I cover under the section
“Plotters,” earlier in this chapter.
Most of the options in the Plot dialog box (see Figure 20-4) are identical to those in the
Page Setup dialog box. If you didn’t create and apply a page setup when you created
the drawing, you can set the properties in the Plot dialog box or select a page setup
from the Name drop-down list under the Page Setup section. The main settings that
you need to set at a minimum when plotting are the device you’re plotting to; paper
size; plot area (if you’re plotting a layout, set this to Layout); and plot scale (which
should be set to 1:1 when plotting a layout).
Before you plot a drawing, make sure that the floating viewports on a layout are config-
ured correctly. You need to check that the correct layers are displayed, set the correct
scale for the Model Space objects to be plotted at, and set the Shade Plot mode that
you want the Model Space objects to be plotted with. When plotting from the Model
tab, you set the same options at a minimum as you do with plotting from a layout tab
except you set the Shade Plot option and the plot scale to the size that the drawing is
plotted at.

10. Close the drawing file without saving any changes to it.
Publishing
The PLOT command outputs your drawings to either an electronic file or a hardcopy,
but you’re limited to plotting one layout at a time, which can be very time consuming 
if you need to plot more than a few layouts. The PUBLISH command (choose File➪
Publish) allows you to plot multiple layouts across multiple drawings very quickly. You
can create both electronic files and hardcopies by using the PUBLISH command, which
allows you to plot all layouts and Model tabs of drawings with the page setup they
were defined with, plot them all to a DWF file, or specify the creation of 3D DWF files.
The PUBLISH command displays the Publish dialog box (see Figure 20-6). From the
Publish dialog box, you can add or remove sheets (or layouts) from drawings. You also
have the ability to control the order in which the layouts are published and the number
of times they’re published, which is great if you need to create multiple hardcopies of
your drawings. You then have the option to save the list of layouts so you can republish
them if you need to later on (even if you’ve made changes to the drawings).
To find out more about publishing drawings with the Publish dialog box, display the
Publish dialog box and click the Help button located in the lower-right corner to dis-
play AutoCAD’s Online Help system.

Publishing Your Models to the Web
Delivering designs to your clients faster and in a way that multiple people can access
them at one time ensures that you complete a project on time — maybe even at or
under budget. AutoCAD supports connectivity with its project collaboration site 
called Buzzsaw (www.autodesk.com/buzzsaw). Buzzsaw does require you to pay a
monthly fee but helps you stay in communication with your team members from start
to finish on a project. Buzzsaw supports the ability to keep track of file revisions and
drawing markups using Autodesk Design Review.
Buzzsaw is more geared towards architectural projects, but it works for manufacturing
projects as well. For the manufacturing community, Autodesk offers Streamline
(www.autodesk.com/streamline), which is similar to Buzzsaw. Other companies
offer Web-based project management and collaboration, such as Atrium (http://
atrium.pragmaticsw.com) and VCollab (www.virtuale3d.com).
In addition to project collaboration and management products, you can post files to 
an FTP site for a client to download and view or create an extranet that can display
images and information that are specific to a project. An extranet is a Web site that is
set up for clients to access and view the progress of their projects; the site is com-
monly protected by a password to make sure only authorized people have access to it.
You can use the Publish to Web feature to generate a Web page and a series of image
files for a client to review for a project. To start the Publish to Web feature, use the
PUBLISHTOWEB command (choose File➪Publish to Web). You have the option to
create a new Web page or work with an existing one. The Publish to Web feature cre-
ates files with the PTW file extension. Then enter a description for the Web page,
select the image type to use (PNG, JPG, or DWF), and specify a template that defines
how the Web page and the content generated will appear.
You then select a theme to apply and pick layouts from the drawing files to add to the
Web page. Because the process is automated through a wizard, you don’t have to
worry about knowing how to create Web pages yourself, but you might need a little
assistance from your IT department in getting the files uploaded onto the company
Web site. Figure 20-7 shows an example of a Web page that was created from two lay-
outs with the Publish to Web dialog box.

Answers to Practice Opportunities
1. To configure a plotter to create a DBX file, select AutoCAD DXB file from the Manufacturers
list box.
Remember to enter a name for the plotter in the Plotter Name text box.
2. How can you adjust the list of scales?
E. You can adjust the scales by choosing Format➪Scale List. In the Edit Scale List dialog box,
you can do any of the following:
• Add a new scale. Click the Add button. Enter the name of the scale and a value to specify the
units for the scale. 
• Reorder the scale list. Select a scale and click Move Up or Move Down.
• Delete a scale. Select a scale, and click the Delete button.
You can also do these:
• Reset the scale list. Click Reset to revert the items in the scale list to the defaults that
AutoCAD shipped with.
• Edit a scale. Select a scale and click the Edit button.
3. How do you configure viewports from the Properties palette, Model tab, and the Layer
Properties dialog box?
• From the Properties palette: Select a viewport from a layout tab and adjust the properties
under the Misc category. You can adjust these properties: how objects display, if the viewport
is locked, and the visual style that displays the objects. 
• From the Model tab: Restore a named view to control which part of the model is displayed.
By using a named view, you can display a background in the viewport as well if you plan to
use a render preset.
• From the Layer Properties Manager dialog box: Select which layers you want to freeze or
thaw based on the viewport, apply layer, linetype, color, lineweight, and plot style.

Importing and Exporting 3D Models
In This Chapter
 Understanding model exchange formats
 Working with file translators
 Using 3D models with non-CAD applications
I
f you’re working in a team environment, not everyone will have access to AutoCAD —
nor would you want everyone on the design team to have access to design files. Because
a design team can consist of people in sales and marketing at times, as well as outside ven-
dors, you need to understand the file formats that you can use to exchange files. AutoCAD
offers a variety of file formats that you can export from and import into AutoCAD. If
AutoCAD doesn’t offer a file format you can use, external file translators allow you to con-
vert a file from one format to another. You can export 3D models to a variety of file formats
that support 2D/3D information or 2D information only.
Exchanging 3D Models
AutoCAD supports the ability to exchange 15 different file formats. Ten of the file formats
that AutoCAD supports for exchange are vector file formats, and the other five are raster file
formats (image files). 
You can’t import or export all of the file formats that AutoCAD supports for exchange from
AutoCAD.
Vector file formats
This section covers the vector file formats that you can export and import into AutoCAD to
exchange 3D models. Vector files store model information as objects such as lines, arcs, sur-
faces, 3D solids, and so on, which makes it possible to modify and edit the geometry. Vector
files are usually smaller than raster files. 
DWG
The drawing file format (.dwg) is native to AutoCAD, and AutoCAD uses it to store 3D
models. You can use this file format to exchange files with users of Autodesk products and
other applications that can exchange DWG files. When exchanging AutoCAD 2007 or 2008
files with users of older versions of AutoCAD, select the correct file format from the Files of
Type drop-down list in the Save As dialog box. Some of the 3D solid and surface objects
didn’t exist in releases prior to AutoCAD 2007, so the objects appear correctly but aren’t
available for edit. You also might have problems with lights and materials when saving to an
older release of AutoCAD or opening a drawing created in AutoCAD 2008 in AutoCAD 2007.

DXF
The Drawing Interchange Format (.dxf) is the official exchange file format that
Autodesk supports for exchanging drawing files with AutoCAD and other CAD applica-
tions. DXF files can contain both 2D and 3D objects like DWG files can. Unlike the DWG
file format, the DXF file format is a well-documented open file format that allows other
CAD software vendors to incorporate the file format into their own applications. You
can create DXF files by using the Save As dialog box and selecting one of the available
DXF file formats from the Files of Type drop-down list. You can open a DXF file by using
the OPEN command (choose File➪Open) and selecting DXF (*.dxf) from the Files of
Type drop-down list in the Open dialog box.
DGN
Microstation Design V8 (.dgn) is one of the latest additions to the file formats that
AutoCAD supports. DGN files are created by the products developed by Bentley
Systems, Inc., a competitor of Autodesk. DGN files can contain both 2D and 3D informa-
tion just like DWG files can. To export a DWG file to DGN, you use the DGNEXPORT com-
mand; choose File➪Export and select V8 DGN (*.dgn) from the Files of Type drop-down
list. To import a DGN file, you use the DGNIMPORT command; choose File➪Import and
select V8 DGN (*.dgn) from the Files of Type drop-down list. If you want to attach a DGN
file, you can use the DGNATTACH command (choose Insert➪DGN Underlay) or the
External References palette (choose Insert➪External References).
SAT
ACIS solid (.sat) is a file format that contains 3D geometry that you can exchange with
a number of 3D applications. You can think of SAT files as the 3D equivalent of DXF files.
To export a SAT file, you use the EXPORT command; choose File➪Export, and select
ACIS (*.sat) from the Files of Type drop-down list. AutoCAD does support the ability to
import a SAT file into a drawing by using the commands ACISIN or IMPORT; choose
File➪Import, and select ACIS (*.sat) from the Files of Type drop-down list.
STL
Solid Object Sterolithography (.stl) is another standardized 3D file format that you
can used to exchange 3D models with other CAD applications and 3D visualization
applications. To export a STL file, you use the EXPORT command; choose File➪Export
and select Lithography (*.stl) from the Files of Type drop-down list. AutoCAD doesn’t
support the ability to import a STL file, but file translators on the market do allow you
to convert a STL file into a SAT file. (I cover file translators later in this chapter.)
WMF
The Windows Metafiles format (.wmf) allows you to exchange 2D representations of a
3D model using very basic geometry types like text, lines, and arcs that might make up
more complex objects like polylines or 3D solids. WMF files are commonly used in
graphic arts programs as a basic vector-based file format that allows you to exchange
files between Abode Illustrator, Corel Draw, and AutoCAD, among others, with ease.
To export a WMF file, you use the WMFOUT command; choose File➪Export, and select
Metafile (*.wmf) from the Files of Type drop-down list. The WMFOPTS command gives
you a few options to control how a WMF file is created when it is exported. AutoCAD
does support the ability to import a WMF file into a drawing by using the commands
WMFIN or IMPORT; choose File➪Import, and select Metafile (*.wmf) from the Files of
Type drop-down list. The system variables WMFBKGND and WMFFOREGND control
the background and foreground color assignments when inserting a WMF file into
AutoCAD.
322
Part VI: Model Interchange 

DWF
Design Web Format (.dwf) files are a creation of Autodesk, and you use them for
exchanging 2D and 3D designs with non-CAD users. DWF files are an electronic repre-
sentation of a plotted drawing. 2D DWF files can contain a single layout or multiple lay-
outs, whereas a 3D DWF file doesn’t contain any layouts but can contain a hierarchical
view of a 3D model and can only contain 3D objects.
To create a 2D DWF file, you use either the PLOT command (choose File➪Plot) or the
PUBLISH command (choose File➪Publish). 3D DWF files are created with the 3DDWF
command; choose File➪Export, and select 3D DWF (*.dwf) from the Files of Type drop-
down list or use the PUBLISH command. When creating a 3D DWF file, you have some
control over how the file is generated by choosing Tools➪Options in the Export 3D
DWF file dialog box. The system variable 3DDWFPREC also contributes to how accurate
a 3D DWF file appears. For more information on the settings for the 3DDWFPREC system
variable, enter 3ddwfprec at the command prompt and press F1 to open the topic page
for the system variable in AutoCAD’s Online Help system.
You attach 2D DWF files to a drawing in a similar fashion to the way you attach DWG
and DGN files. To attach a 2D DWF file, you use the DWFATTACH command (choose
insert➪DWF Underlay). Anyone can view DWF files via a free viewer, which makes it a
good format when you’re sharing files with non-AutoCAD users. The free viewer is
called Autodesk Design Review (www.autodesk.com/designreview). Autodesk
Design Review allows you to view and print DWF files, along with creating markups
and performing measurements on design files. If you have Windows Vista, you can
view and print the new DWFx files directly without the viewer. Figure 21-1 shows a 3D
DWF file opened in Autodesk Design Review.
Model courtesy of Mark Hechel of MasterGraphics, Inc.
Don’t confuse Autodesk Design Review with the program Autodesk DWF Viewer.
Autodesk DWF Viewer is limited to being able to view and print only DWF files; this is
the version of the viewer prior to the release of Autodesk Design Review.
EPS
Encapsulated Postscript (.eps) files are used primarily with publishing and graphic arts
applications such as Corel Draw and Adobe Illustrator. You can use EPS files to create
exploded views for assembly documents or other types of documents that might show
Figure 21-1:

motorcycle.
323
Chapter 21: Importing and Exporting 3D Models

line art drawings. To create an EPS file, you use the PSOUT command; choose File➪
Export and select Encapsulated PS (*.eps) from the Files of Type drop-down list. You
can control a number of settings when you create an EPS file by choosing Tools➪
Options to display the PostScript Out Options dialog box while in the Export Data
dialog box.
PLT
AutoCAD Plot (.plt) files are generated when you plot a drawing to a file instead of a
plotter. PLT files contain only a 2D representation of the plotted drawing. You can create
PLT files to send to a reprographics company that specializes in plotting large volumes
of drawings. To create a PLT file, select the Plot to File option in the Plot dialog box. A
PLT file is similar to a PRN file that you can print to a Windows system printer. PLT files
contain some additional instructions for the plotter to plot the drawing correctly.
Raster file formats
This section covers the raster file formats that you can export out of AutoCAD to
exchange data from 3D models with non-CAD users. Raster files don’t maintain the
ability to modify an object like a line or an arc, and they store information as a series
of colored pixels, which causes the information to be converted into 2D data instead of
remaining 3D data. Raster images are typically larger files than vector files.
You can attach all the raster image file formats — with the exception of PDF files — to
a 3D object using the Texture Map map type. Raster images can also be used as a back-
ground of the current viewport during rendering or attached to a drawing with the
IMAGEATTACH command (choose Insert➪Raster Image Reference). The raster images
(not excluding PDF files) can also be created from a rendered image that is generated
in the Render Window using the Save option.
BMP
Windows Bitmap (.bmp) files are one of the most common image files that are
exchanged with non-CAD users. The downside to BMP files is that they don’t offer any
built-in file compression, which makes them very large and hard to send through
e-mail. You can use just about any image viewer or Web browser to view a BMP file,
which make them nice for exchanging with your design team. Use the BMPOUT com-
mand, which allows you to select which objects in the current view you want to
export, when you create the BMP file. Or use the EXPORT command; choose File➪
Export and select Bitmap (*.bmp) from the Files of Type drop-down list. 
TIF
Tag Image File Format (.tif) files aren’t everyday image files used for exchanging 
3D models because they are very large. Your marketing department may request TIF
files though, because TIFs are good for creating brochures for sales literature or pricing
catalogs. TIF files are not commonly sent through the Internet due to their file size. You
create TIF files with the TIFOUT command, which allows you to select the objects in the
current view that you want to export.
PNG
Portable Network Graphics (.png) files are one of the most commonly used image files
for exchanging images or to post on a company Web site because they offer the same
quality as a BMP file but use compression technology that makes them a fraction of
the file size; they’re optimal for e-mailing and using on the Internet. You can create
PNG files with the PNGOUT command, which allows you to select the objects in the
current view that you want to export. In addition to the PNGOUT command, you can
plot to a PNG file by using the PublishToWeb PNG.pc3 plotter. 
324
Part VI: Model Interchange 

JPG
JPEG (.jpg) graphic files are all-around graphic files that offer compression and the
ability to control the file quality, which can increase or decrease the file size. JPEG 
files — at about the same size as a PNG file — are usually much smaller than BMP files
so they can be transmitted through e-mail and used on the Internet. You can create
JPEG files with the JPGOUT command, which allows you to select the objects in the
current view that you want to export. In addition to the JPGOUT command, you can
plot to a JPG file by using the PublishToWeb JPG.pc3 plotter.
PDF
Adobe Acrobat Portable Document (.pdf) files are often associated with Word docu-
ments, electronic brochures, and other office documents such as standard forms. PDF
files can contain 2D and 3D information, but AutoCAD can generate only a PDF file that
contains a 2D representation of your 3D model. To create a 3D representation of your
3D model, you need to purchase a copy of Adobe Acrobat 3D. To find out more informa-
tion about Adobe Acrobat 3D, visit Adobe’s Web site (www.adobe.com/products/
acrobat3d).
Viewing PDF files requires a special viewer called Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is 
free and is installed on most computers these days. If you don’t have Adobe Acrobat
Reader installed on your computer, you can download it from Adobe’s Web site
(www.adobe.com). AutoCAD doesn’t support the ability to import or attach PDF files
like it does for other raster file formats. To create a PDF file in AutoCAD, use the Plot
dialog box and the plotter named DWG to PDF.pc3.
File Translators
Because the economy has gone global since the turn of the century and the introduc-
tion of the Internet, file translators have become essential in the way businesses oper-
ate. A file translator is an application that allows you to take an electronic file of a
specific format and convert it into a different file format. Using a translator makes it
easier to convert files with users who might use a different release of AutoCAD or 
to a different CAD file format altogether. Companies like Autodesk build in the most
common file formats that most customers want, but at times that isn’t enough. File
translators are often developed by third parties that obtain the rights to use a file
format from the company that publishes the file or dissect a file format and create an
application that can read and write a file from one format to another, allowing files to
be opened in different applications with greater ease.
Some of the file translators on the market are free, and some you must purchase.
Although a free deal is hard to pass up, you often get what you pay for. 
File translators aren’t the end-all solution, but they can eliminate the need to purchase
software that you might not really use every day. Take a look at these translators to
help exchange 3D models:
 TransMagic (www.transmagic.com): The TransMagic products allow you to
convert AutoCAD files from a number of popular file formats, such as IGES, STEP,
STL, Pro/ENGINNER, ACIS, and Inventor, among others. They translate 3D models
created in AutoCAD using either the STL or ACIS file format. 
 CADlook (www.cadlook.com): The CADlook Batch Translators allow you to
translate SAT/ACIS files to IGES, STEP, VDA, X_T, VRML, and STL.

Chapter 21: Importing and Exporting 3D Models

Harnessing 3D Models in 
Non-CAD Applications
It’s great to kick back in the cubicle (or maybe even the corner office with a window)
and enjoy your 3D models in AutoCAD, but the reality is that at some point your 3D
model must leave the confines in which it was created. When the 3D model does finally
leave the nest (also known as AutoCAD), it most likely appears in a presentation
shown to a client or whisked across the Internet in an e-mail. You can import a raster
file directly into a document that you create in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, but you
can also embed a lightweight representation of your 3D model in the form of a DWF file
into a Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint presentation.
DWF files are embedded in a Word document or PowerPoint presentation with little
effort, and they can add a little extra glitz and dazzle for the client. When you embed a
DWF file in an application, you create a link to an installed component on the com-
puter that displays a file created in another application. In this case, the installed com-
ponent is called the Autodesk DWF Viewer Control.
To use the Autodesk DWF Viewer Control, the Autodesk Design Review or DWF Viewer
needs to be installed on the computer in order to view the file. The Autodesk DWF
Viewer Control allows you to zoom, pan, and orbit directly in the file that the control is
embedded in, which can make a presentation more interesting for the client to watch.
Exercise 21-1: Creating a 3D DWF File
For this exercise, open the drawing file Exercise21-1.dwg from the Chapter 21
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder under My Documents. Then practice creating
a 3D DWF file.
1. At the command prompt, enter 3ddwfprec and press Enter.
2. At the Enter new value for 3DDWFPREC <2>: prompt, enter 4 and press
Enter.
A value of 4 is a greater precision value to create the 3D DWF and makes the
drawing appear smoother than the default value of 2.
3. Choose File➪Export.
4. In the Export Data dialog box, select 3D DWF (*.dwf) from the Files of Type drop-
down list.
5. Choose Tools➪Options.
6. In the 3D DWF Publish dialog box (see Figure 21-2), make sure that the All Model
Space Objects option is selected and the Publish with Materials check box is
selected. Click OK.
7. Browse to the Chapter 21 folder in the My Practice Drawings folder and enter the
name Completed21-1 in the File Name text box. Click Save.
8. When the message box appears, click Yes to view the 3D DWF file created with
Autodesk Design review (or Autodesk DWF Viewer based on what is installed) or
No to not view the DWF file created.
9. Close the viewer when you’re done reviewing the model. 
Many of the navigation tools in the viewer are similar to those in AutoCAD. The
3D DWF file in the viewer looks similar to the one shown earlier in Figure 21-1.
10. Close the drawing and don’t save any changes.

Exercise 21-2: Embedding a 3D DWF File into PowerPoint
In this exercise, you practice embedding a 3D DWF file into PowerPoint.
1. To launch PowerPoint 2003, choose Start➪(All) Programs➪Microsoft Office➪
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003.
To launch PowerPoint 2002, choose Start➪(All) Programs➪Microsoft PowerPoint.
The location of the shortcut to start PowerPoint varies based on the version of
Microsoft Office you have.
2. In PowerPoint, choose Insert➪New Slide and then delete all the objects off the
slide by selecting them and pressing the Delete key.
3. Choose Insert➪Object.
4. In the Insert Object dialog box (see Figure 21-3), select Autodesk DWF Viewer
Control and click OK.
A new object is added to the slide. You can select the object and use the grips
along the edges to resize the object if you need to.
5. Right-click the object that you just inserted and choose Autodesk DWF Viewer
Control Object➪Properties from the shortcut menu.
6. In the Autodesk DWF Viewer Control Properties dialog box, click Browse.
7. In the Path to the File You Wish to View dialog box, browse to the Chapter 21
folder in the My Practice Drawings folder and select Completed21-1.dwf.
Click open.
The Completed21-1.dwf file was created in Exercise 21-1. If you don’t have the
file, complete Exercise 21-1 first.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
utoCAD is a very complex application for new users
to start with, and because it changes so quickly from
release to release, many features are often overlooked.
This part gives you an overview of the new features intro-
duced in AutoCAD 2008 that you can use to improve your
skill set and drafting efficiency. Although the Online Help
system that comes with AutoCAD contains a lot of docu-
mentation and is very complete, it also contains a lot of
information, making it hard at times to find just what you
are looking for. So in this part, I provide a listing of a vari-
ety of Web sites that you can visit to find information on
features in AutoCAD and industry-specific information.
Whether you’re trying to find out how to create a render-
ing or trying to find a 3D model of a standard bolt, you
should be able to find a resource to help you out. 

Chapter 22
More than Ten New Features
in AutoCAD 2008
E
ach year, a new release of AutoCAD delivers new features and improved productivity.
This chapter brings attention to the many new features that are in AutoCAD 2008. These
features can help improve productivity and the visual quality of your drawings. The content
of this chapter is an overview of the many new enhancements in AutoCAD 2008, and not a
full, in-depth look at each new feature and how to use it.
Improvements to 2D Drafting
2D drafting has been the core focus of AutoCAD since it was first introduced in the early
1980s. With each release, Autodesk comes up with features that improve 2D drafting.
AutoCAD 2007 introduced the ability to attach Design Web Format (DWF) files to a drawing
as an underlay, which was similar to an external referenced drawing but in a read-only state.
With AutoCAD 2008, you now have the ability to control the visibility of individual layers of a
DWF underlay as long as the layers were originally published with the DWF file. Along with
being able to control the layers of a DWF underlay, other layer improvements allow you to
fade the contents of a locked layer or apply property overrides to a layer for a viewport.
Along with layer improvements, AutoCAD provides a new workspace for 2D drafting and
allows you to work in a few different ways with design (DGN) files created with MicroStation,
which is developed by Bentley Systems, Inc. (www.bentley.com).
New dashboard panels and workspace 
with a focus on 2D drafting
The Dashboard was introduced in AutoCAD 2007 as a way to access groups of 3D features
that help to improve the workflow of 3D modeling. The concept of panels and the Dashboard
has been expanded to incorporate 2D drafting and annotation features, along with other 
general processes that are used for both 2D and 3D drafting.
The new 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace uses the Dashboard palette and a new toolbar
named Standard Annotation. The Standard Annotation toolbar is a shortened version of the
Standard toolbar. By default, eight control panels are displayed on the Dashboard palette
when the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace is current: Layers, 2D Draw, Annotation
Scaling, Dimensions, Text, Multileaders, Tables, and 2D Navigate. To discover more about
using and creating workspaces, see Chapter 3.

Table 24-1 lists the new panels that have been added to the Dashboard for 2D drafting
and working with annotation in a drawing.
Table 24-1
2D-Related Dashboard Panels
Dashboard Panel Name
Description
2D Navigate
Contains basic panning and zooming tools along with the ability
to set a named view current.
Annotation Scaling
Contains tools that allow you to add or delete objects from the
current annotation scale.
Block Attributes
Contains tools that allow you to create new blocks and to
create, modify, and extract attributes in blocks.
Dimensions
Contains tools that allow you to create and modify both dimen-
sion objects and dimension styles.
Layers
Contains tools that allow you to create, modify, and manage
layers, layer states, and layer filters.
Multileaders
Contains tools that allow you to create and modify both multi-
leader objects and styles.
Object Properties
Contains tools that allow you to set the current entity properties
that are used when creating new objects. The properties
include color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style.
Tables
Contains tools that allow you to create and modify both table
objects and table styles.
Text
Contains tools that allow you to create and modify single-line
and multiline text objects and manage text styles. The panel
also contains tools to find text and check for misspelled words.
Layer improvements
AutoCAD 2008 allows you to override the color, linetype, lineweight, and plot style
properties of layers by viewport. This can help make working with client drawings
much easier. Instead of translating all the layers in drawings to match your standards
for plotting, now you can just remap the properties of a layer for a viewport when plot-
ting. The ability to override layer properties by viewport is also great for working with
details and things like hatching where you might want the hatching to still be displayed
but want it to plot lighter in one viewport.
Another new feature for layers is the ability to control the fade level of layers that are
locked in the drawing. By fading locked layers, AutoCAD allows you to focus more on
the editable objects in the drawing. The controls for setting the fade value of locked
layers are done from the Layers panel on the Dashboard, and the fade value is applied
globally across all locked layers. You can access other layer features from the new
Layers panel on the Dashboard, such as isolating layers, switching to a saved layer
state or filter, or changing the current layer. For more information on layers, see the
topic Work with Layers in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Control layers for DWFs
AutoCAD 2007 first introduced the ability to attach a DWF file as an underlay that was
similar to attaching an external referenced drawing, but with a few limitations. When a
DWF file was attached to a drawing, you couldn’t control the layers that were dis-
played in the file, and you couldn’t bind (or merge) the geometry in the DWF file with
the geometry in the drawing that the DWF file was attached to. AutoCAD 2008 resolves
the limitation of not being able to control which layers in the DWF file are displayed by
introducing the DWFLAYERS command. The way you work with the DWF Layers dialog
box is similar to the way you can work with Layers in Autodesk Design Review. For
more information on working with layers in a DWF file, see the topic Control the
Display of Layers in a DWF Underlay in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Work with DGN Files
AutoCAD 2008 now allows you to import a DGN file and convert all the geometry in the
file to native AutoCAD objects. DGN files are created with another popular CAD appli-
cation on the market called MicroStation, which is developed by Bentley Systems, Inc.
MicroStation can be found in use by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for some
states, along with other companies that primarily focus on civil designs. Along with
being able to import DGN files, AutoCAD can also reverse the process and take a DWG
file and convert it into a DGN file. 
Being able to import and export the contents of a DGN file is one way of working, but
AutoCAD also allows you to attach a DGN file in mostly the same way that you can
attach a DWF file. After you attach a DNG file, you can snap to its geometry much like
you can snap to objects that you create in a drawing or that are part of an attached
DWF file. For more information on working with DGN files, see the topics Attach DGN
Files as Underlays, Import MicroStation V8 DGN Files, and Export MicroStation V8
DGN Files in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Inverse clipping for external references
When clipping an external referenced drawing, you can now choose to invert the clip-
ping boundary so everything inside the specified boundary is hidden instead of every-
thing on the outside of the boundary. To invert the clipped boundary, use the Invert
clip option when creating the boundary. The Invert clip option toggles the invert clip-
ping mode on or off based on the current setting when you use the option. For more
information on clipping an external reference, see the topic Clip Referenced Drawings
and Blocks in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Productivity Changes to 
Annotating Drawings
Annotation is probably one of the most critical things you can add to your drawings to
ensure it’s manufactured or built directly. Annotation comes in a variety of different
formats, from tables to dimension objects and leaders. Most of the objects for annota-
tion in a drawing have been changed slightly. The main reason for this is a new feature
333
Chapter 22: More than Ten New Features in AutoCAD 2008

called annotation scaling, which eliminates some problems people have had using mul-
tiple dimensions or multiple scaled blocks to show dimensions and notes at the right
scale in a viewport when plotting. Many other changes also give you better control
over paragraph text and improved spell checking — something that I need because of
my bad spelling habits. 
Annotation scaling
Annotation scaling is by far the biggest new feature that is in AutoCAD 2008 because it
touches so many different features. Annotation scaling allows you to add annotation
objects such as text, dimensions, hatch objects, or even blocks to a drawing in one scale
but have the size/scale of the objects update automatically by changing the current
annotation scale value. For a long time, many people have been placing dimensions on a
layout or have been creating two sets of dimensions for the model so they could display
dimensions in a uniform size across multiple viewports with different scales.
You can assign annotation scaling by viewport. Doing so turns off the visibility of the
object, or it’s resized in the case of hatch, text, or dimension objects. You can assign a
property to blocks so they interact with annotation scaling, which can be helpful for
things like grid markers, cut symbols, and notes. To use annotation scaling, you spec-
ify that the object or style that is assigned to an annotation object is designated for
use with annotation scaling and then you adjust the annotation scale for the current
viewport. You can adjust the annotation scale value from the status bar of the applica-
tion window or the drawing window. For more information on annotation scaling, see
the topic Scale Annotations in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Multiline text improvements
Paragraph text (or multiline text) has seen many improvements over the past several
releases. You can find a number of significant changes to formatting paragraph text,
which include being able to create columns of text, align individual paragraphs, use
enhanced tabs, control indents better, and extend the use of paragraph and line spac-
ing settings.
The new columns feature allows you to create columns of text for long specifications
or notes. You can specify the columns as static numbers or have them automatically
created based on the height of the multiline text object. After the number of columns
is defined, you can just start typing text, and the text wraps between the columns as
necessary. You can set the width of a column and even the width of the gutter that’s
between columns in the Column Settings dialog box. You can display the Column
Settings dialog box by clicking the Columns button on the Text Formatting toolbar and
then choosing Column Settings from the menu that appears.
In AutoCAD 2008, you can specify a different justification for each paragraph, and you
can use many different tab options. The tab options have been improved to include
center, right, and decimal alignment options in addition to the existing left tab option.
Paragraph and line spacing have also been improved to give you better control of the
values. To specify indents, tabs, and other paragraph formatting options, you use
the Paragraph dialog box. You can display the Paragraph dialog box by clicking the
Paragraph button on the Text Formatting toolbar. For more information on multiline
text, see the topics Create Multiline Text and Create and Edit Columns in Multiline Text
in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Changes to spell checking
When performing spell checking, you can now check text that’s part of a dimension
and filter by whether you want to include words in block attributes and external refer-
ences in AutoCAD 2008. Along with the ability to filter by certain types of objects, you
can choose some common types of words to ignore, such as capitalized words or
words with numbers.
Other improvements allow you to manage more than one custom dictionary, and you
can switch between different dictionaries. The ability to manage custom dictionaries
allows you to have a personal dictionary to use and a centralized dictionary that might
be shared among all drafters in your department or company. When checking a draw-
ing, you now can search the entire drawing, the current viewport/layout, or the objects
you select. AutoCAD zooms to a misspelled word and highlights it to make it easier
for you to identify the word in question. The SPELL command and Check Spelling
dialog box (choose Tools➪Spelling) check for misspelled words in a drawing. For more
information on spell checking, see the topic Check Spelling in the Online Help system
of AutoCAD.
Multiline attributes
AutoCAD has supported the ability to create both single-line and multiline text objects
for a long time, but attributes always seemed to take a backseat and were content with
being single lines. It appears that attributes finally had enough and revolted, because
they now support multilines as well, which is great for things like plot stamps and title
blocks along with other blocks that might need to contain more than one line of infor-
mation in them.
To create an attribute that supports multiple lines of text, you need to enable the
Multiple Lines mode (or property) when creating a new attribute with the ATTDEF
command or from the Properties palette when you want to modify existing attributes
to support the new multiline behavior. When the Multiple Lines mode is enabled, 
the In-Place Text Editor is used to create or modify the value that’s assigned to an
attribute, which is like creating or editing a multiline text object. For more information
on creating multiline attributes, see the topic Define Block Attributes in the Online
Help system of AutoCAD.
Table improvements
Tables have a lot of potential to change the way you do schedules and generate a bill
of materials in a drawing. AutoCAD 2008 introduces a number of the requests that
users have been asking for since tables were introduced and even before then. Some of
the new changes with the way you work with the table editor will remind you of tasks
that can be performed in Microsoft Excel.
The table indicator has been improved to allow you to select an entire row, column,
or the whole table. You can format cells by using the new cell styles, which can be
applied to an individual cell or an entire row or column. Along with cell styles, table
styles have seen some improvements that give you much more flexibility in the way a
table looks.
335
Chapter 22: More than Ten New Features in AutoCAD 2008

Formatting improvements aren’t the only changes that are new with tables. You can
now create a linked table that allows you to bring information from a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet into AutoCAD. To create a table with linked information, you use the Data
Link Manager dialog box and the New Excel Data Link dialog box. You can format linked
tables by default, but you can’t edit the cells in linked tables unless you open the
source file directly or unlock the table. If you make edits in the table, you can write the
changes back to the Excel spreadsheet. To display the Data Link Manager to create a
linked table, you can enter datalink at the command prompt or click the From a Data
Link radio button in the Insert Table dialog box (choose Draw➪Table). For more infor-
mation on working with tables, see the topic Create and Modify Tables or the topic Link
a Table to External Data in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Dimension enhancements
In AutoCAD 2008, dimensions see some new enhancements that help to improve the
communication of your designs. One of the new features available allows you to
change existing dimensions to an inspection dimension. It indicates critical dimensions
or tolerances that need to be checked during the manufacturing of a part and how
often to perform a quality assurance check. Inspection dimensions are made up of a
label, the dimension value, and an inspection rate. The Inspection Dimension dialog
box (choose Dimension➪Inspection) adds and removes inspection dimensions to and
from existing dimensions in a drawing.
Other changes to dimensions include the ability to place a radial dimension off the
object that is being dimensioned, and when this is done, an arc extension line is drawn
to ensure the radius or diameter of the object is properly communicated. In addition
to changes to the radial dimension, you can now specify which quadrant an angular
dimension is dimensioned to, which allows you to place the dimension text outside the
extension lines where a dimension line is drawn to the dimension text.
AutoCAD 2007 saw the inclusion of a jogged radial dimension to communicate the
radius of an object, but the dimension used a user-defined center point instead of the
true center point of the object. AutoCAD 2008 introduces a jogged linear dimension,
but unlike the jogged radial dimension, it isn’t an entirely new object; instead, it’s a
linear dimension with a jogged symbol added to it after the linear dimensions is
placed. Jogged linear dimensions indicate when the distance between the extension
lines isn’t the true length of the object being dimensioned. Typically, the dimension
value displayed is smaller than what the object would measure.
Some additional enhancements to dimensions are the abilities to align a tolerance by
either its operational symbol or decimal separator, to space linear dimensions an
equal distance apart or align parallel linear or angular dimensions, and to create
breaks in a dimension where a dimension or object intersects another dimension or
multileader. Adding dimension breaks to dimensions or multileaders ensures that the
dimensions or leaders in the drawing aren’t misinterpreted. For more information on
working with dimensions, see the topic Dimensions and Tolerances in the Online Help
system of AutoCAD.
Multileaders
Leaders are used to call out a feature of a design, such as the number of holes on a plate
if they’re of a typical size or when something should be welded. Leaders serve many dif-
ferent purposes, and AutoCAD 2008 extends the capability of leaders by introducing a
new multileader object. The multileader object, as its name suggests, can have multiple
leaders to a single block or text object. By using multiple leaders, you can simplify the
336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

editing process in the drawing if something changes. Multileaders are created with the
MLEADER command. Like dimensions, you use styles to control the appearance of multi-
leaders. You create styles for a multileader with the Multileader Style Manager (choose
Format➪Multileader Style).
Multileaders also support annotation scaling like other annotation objects do, and they
can be broken with the dimension break feature. Multileaders for the most part function
like leaders created with the quick leader (QLEADER) and legacy leader (LEADER) com-
mands from previous releases. For more information on creating multileaders, see the
topic Create and Modify Leaders in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Enhancements to 3D Visualization
AutoCAD 2007 brought many much-needed improvements to visualization in AutoCAD,
and AutoCAD 2008 builds on those changes with even more enhancements. Although it
isn’t quite as much of an evolution as it was last release, the improvements in materi-
als and lighting and the introduction of plug-ins in this release are welcome additions
to the feature set.
Direct 3D support
AutoCAD has supported both hardware and software acceleration for some time now.
Hardware acceleration improves the quality of the on-screen image when working with
3D modeling and visualization. With AutoCAD 2008, you can now choose to use either
OpenGL or Direct 3D for the driver type when using hardware acceleration as long as
your graphics card supports both types of drivers. Previous releases of AutoCAD sup-
ported only OpenGL. To find out more about hardware acceleration, see Chapter 3.
Backgrounds
Backgrounds used with named views and cameras when rendering or using a 3D visual
style now have the ability to generate a sun and sky. In the Adjust Sun & Sky Background
dialog box, you can specify the position of the sun, its color, and other settings of the
sun such as haze and the horizon. To access the Adjust Sun & Sky Background dialog
box, you must enable photometric lighting in the drawing. (For more information on
working with photometric lighting, see Chapter 16.) When photometric lighting is
enabled, display the View Manager (choose View➪Named Views) and select an existing
view or a new view. If you select an existing view, click the Background Override prop-
erty and select Sun & Sky from the drop-down list. If you create a new view, select Sun &
Sky from the Background drop-down list in the New View dialog box. For more informa-
tion on setting a background for a named view, see Chapter 5.
More lighting
Lighting has been improved in this release to include photometric lighting, which gives
the lights in a model a much more realistic behavior. Along with lights now supporting
photometric settings, you have the ability to create a few additional types of lights that
weren’t available in AutoCAD 2007. These additional types of lights are free spotlight,
target point, and weblight. For more information on setting up and using lights, see
Chapter 16.
337
Chapter 22: More than Ten New Features in AutoCAD 2008

Enhanced material options
Materials give your models a more realistic look, and a lot of work has been done in
this area since AutoCAD 2007. You now have access to five additional procedural
maps, along with the ability to create complex materials by nesting materials. You can
also designate which materials are two-sided, unlike its predecessor, which allowed
you to designate two-sided materials only at a global level when rendering. Keeping
with the photometric lighting changes, you can now specify the luminance of a mate-
rial, which is mutually exclusive with specifying of the self-illumination attribute for a
material. For more information on creating materials, see Chapter 17.
General Odds and Ends Enhancements
With each release, Autodesk tries to focus on a few major features; some medium-size
updates to existing features; and then some small, noteworthy enhancements that you
might find helpful in your day-to-day work. However, not everyone benefits from these
smaller changes because everyone uses different AutoCAD features.
Support for Windows Vista and 64-bit
AutoCAD 2008 introduces support for Windows Vista (all editions) and continues to
support Windows 2000 (with Service Pack 4 installed) and Windows XP (Home and
Professional with Service Pack 2 installed). In addition to Windows Vista support,
AutoCAD now comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for the first time. The 64-bit ver-
sion allows you to open much larger 3D models with greater ease due to the capability
of the operating system to work with larger amounts of physical memory.
Reorder and rename layouts
Layouts can now be reordered by simply dragging and dropping a layout to the new
location you want it to appear in. By placing the layouts in a specific order, you can
ensure that the sheets are published in the correct order. You can also now rename a
layout by double-clicking over a layout tab to display the in-place editor that allows
you to enter a new name for the layout.
Windows Explorer shell enhancements for DWF
You can now double-click a Design Web Format (DWF) file in Windows Explorer to
open the file in the default viewer. The default viewer for DWF files in most cases is
Autodesk Design Review because it gets installed with AutoCAD, but you might also be
using the older DWF viewer called Autodesk DWF Viewer.
Import and export migrate custom settings
AutoCAD now comes with a utility that allows you to export your custom settings and
files out to a migration package that is a Zip archive. You can later import the migration
338
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

package back onto the system after reinstalling AutoCAD if necessary or using it to con-
figure other machines running the same release of AutoCAD with the same custom set-
tings and files.
The export and import utilities are located on the Windows Start menu. Choose Start
menu (Windows)➪All Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2008➪Migrate Custom Settings
and then click Export AutoCAD 2008 Settings or Import AutoCAD 2008 Settings. For
more information on exporting and importing custom settings, see the topic Export and
Import Custom Settings from the Same Release in the Online Help system of AutoCAD.
Customize user interface changes
The Customize User Interface was first introduced in AutoCAD 2006 when it was wel-
comed with mixed feelings, but after a few releases, many of the issues that the feature
was introduced with have been resolved, and a number of new enhancements have been
introduced in AutoCAD 2008. The Customize User Interface can be accessed by choosing

InfoCenter
InfoCenter replaces the Info Palette that was in AutoCAD 2007. When you use InfoCenter,
you can access content from the Online Help system and resources that are on the
Internet or even an intranet. The InfoCenter is displayed in the upper-right corner of the
AutoCAD application window and allows you to enter a text string to search for. Based
on the resources set up, the results of a keyword search might include a number of
matches that are located on different Web sites and even the Online Help system with
the most relevant information displayed at the top of the results in each category.

Chapter 22: More than Ten New Features in AutoCAD 2008

Autodesk Impression technology preview
A preview of Autodesk Impression comes with AutoCAD, which allows you to improve
the quality of the presentation drawings that you create. When AutoCAD is installed,
a toolbar called Autodesk Impression is added for you to use. The first time you click
one of the buttons on the toolbar, you’re prompted to download and install Autodesk
Impression.
After it’s installed, you can open a DWG or DWF file into Autodesk Impression and make
the lines in the file appear hand drawn, and you can create various fills that might be
solid in color or even made up of a texture. There are also blocks in Autodesk Impression
that you can add to the look of the final presentation. Because Autodesk Impression is
developed by Autodesk, it understands things like layers and blocks, which make learn-
ing and using the application easier.

More than Ten Software and
Professional Design Resources
G
etting to know 3D in AutoCAD isn’t like it once was. Before the Internet, many people
attempted to figure out 3D modeling on their own — which makes figuring out AutoCAD
a long process. These days, you can use your favorite browser to access tutorials and
resources. You can find information on how to use the 3D modeling features in AutoCAD
through peer-to-peer communities, the software vendor’s Web site, or Web logs (journals)
known as blogs that are often created by users of the software. I’ve gathered a variety of
sites that can help you understand 3D modeling in AutoCAD and find out about topics
related to mechanical design. 
Autodesk Web Site
Probably one of the most important Web sites for you to visit is, of course, the Autodesk site
at www.autodesk.com. The Web site offers you several benefits: the ability to access online
forums to ask questions when you need a little bit of help; blogs about new treads; tips on
how to become more efficient at using AutoCAD; information on updates to the program; and
a resource to find the nearest professional training facility to expand your knowledge of work-
ing in 3D. Autodesk maintains a Knowledge Database that you can search for frequently asked
questions, too. One of the newest additions to the Autodesk Web site is a Manufacturing
Community (http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com) that offers content sharing, informa-
tion to local events, tips and tricks, and much more.
Autodesk User Group International
Another great site that you should visit is AUGI (www.augi.com). Autodesk Users Group
International (AUGI) is an independent organization made up of members scattered around
the world. It also helps users organize local user groups. These locally organized groups can
provide you with opportunities to meet other professionals in your area and to participate in
live, one-on-one activities. The AUGI Web site offers interactive forums, communities, access
to educational opportunities and materials, and publications such as AUGIWorld and AUGI
Hotnews. You need to be a member of AUGI to access the site, but membership is free and
comes with lots of benefits.

CAD-Related Web Sites
You should check out these Web sites for good information on computer-aided drafting:
 CAD Digest (www.caddigest.com): CAD Digest provides links to industry news,
tutorials, and tips and tricks for AutoCAD and related products.
 upFront eZine (www.upfrontezine.com): upFront provides broader coverage
than CAD Digest. Covering “The Business of CAD” the eZine covers all of the CAD
industry.
 Cadalyst (www.cadalyst.com): Cadalyst is one of the oldest resource sites on
the Internet that is related to AutoCAD and other Autodesk products. Before the
Internet, Cadalyst existed as a printed publication. The magazine is still avail-
able, but it primarily exists through an electronic format now. The site offers
hardware and software reviews, along with articles that are focused on helping
you to improve your drafting skills.
 MCADCafe (www.mcadcafe.com): MCADCafe is a portal for mechanical design–
related information. The site offers forums, access to industry-related news, a
weekly newsletter that you can subscribe to, and information on upcoming
events.
 TenLinks (www.tenlinks.com): TenLinks is a CAD-related portal that allows you
to find information on general CAD topics related to many of the top industry
software programs to much more specific topics related to CAM (computer-aided
manufacturing) and CAE (computer-aided engineering). The site also offers news
throughout the CAD industry. 
Industry Events
Industry events are a great way to discover new trends and techniques that you can
apply to your models and products. Autodesk hosts a user event each year that is
focused on helping its users become more proficient with its applications. The event,
called Autodesk University (www.autodesk.com/au), gets larger every year. Other
industry events are organized for various different industries, and are focused on let-
ting you know about new products and software applications that could help you
get your designs done more efficiently. To find out about industry events like the
Design and Manufacturing South event (www.devicelink.com/expo/spack2007/
dmsouth_expo.html), I recommend checking out TenLinks (www.tenlinks.com),
which lists many of the upcoming industry events.
Related Professional and Industrial Web Sites
Mechanical design is a very large and broad topic that is broken into a number of differ-
ent fields. Some of these fields range from working with injection molding to aluminum.
The following are industry-specific Web sites that provide information to design profes-
sionals who work in the different design fields:
 Aluminum Association, Inc. (www.aluminum.org)
 American Casting Association (www.americancastingassoc.org)
 American Iron and Steel Institute, AISI (www.steel.org)
 American National Standards Institute, ANSI (www.ansi.org)

 The Society of the Plastics Industry, SPI (www.plasticsindustry.org)
Industry Blogs
Web logs (blogs) are a form of a personal journal. Autodesk hosts many blogs that are
related to different industries, including mechanical design. Many of these blogs focus
on how to use Autodesk products, of course, and at times they provide information on
specific tasks that are related to the industry focus for the blog. 
Some blogs that Autodesk hosts are related to mechanical design:
 Drawing the Machine (http://blogs.autodesk.com/drawing_the_machine)
 The Gear Box (http://blogs.autodesk.com/the_gear_box)
 Other Autodesk blogs (http://blogs.autodesk.com)
Autodesk isn’t the only company that offers blogs; users of AutoCAD also are getting
involved on the blog scene. Here are a few user blogs that focus more on general
design and AutoCAD topics:
 Daily AutoCAD (www.dailyautocad.com)
 In the Dynamic Interface (http://mdouglas.blogs.com/in_the_dynamic_
interface)
CAD Management 
CAD management is often a taboo topic in the work of design, but it helps you avoid
some disastrous situations in companies that have a large number of drawing files. By
implementing CAD management, you can avoid inconsistent drawings or even acciden-
tal alterations of drawings that can lead to lost profits and failed projects. In addition,
you can implement software packages that help to manage drawing files and revisions
done to them. 
343
Chapter 23: More than Ten Software & Professional Design Resources

Here are some resources that can help you with CAD management:
 CADDManager.com (www.caddmanager.com) is a Web site dedicated to the
topic of CAD management, with an emphasis on Autodesk products.
 Cad-organizer (www.cad-organizer.com) is a browser-based document-
management software for AutoCAD drawings.
 Adept 7 (www.synergis-adept.com) is a robust, database-oriented CAD docu-
ment management program that can be used with MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server. 
 Autodesk over the past few years has been working on its own integrated CAD-
management solutions. The applications that Autodesk offers for the design
industry include Autodesk Vault (www.autodesk.com/vault) and Autodesk
Productstream (www.autodesk.com/productstream). Autodesk also offers
two Web-based collaboration sites called Autodesk Streamline (www.autodesk.
com/streamline) and Autodesk Buzzsaw (www.autodesk.com/buzzsaw)
that allow for sharing designs with your extended project team.
CAD Utilities and Support Software
Adobe Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com/acrobat) is a free application that allows
you to view PDF (Portable Document Format) files created with AutoCAD. Adobe
Acrobat 3D is the newest member in the Acrobat software family of products and
allows you to create PDF files with an embedded 3D design.
Autodesk Design Review (www.autodesk.com/designreview) is a free software
application that allows users to view DWF and Autodesk Inventor files, and it comes
with an application called DWG TrueView, which allows you to view DWG and DWF
files. The application also allows you to perform measurements on objects in the files
and create markups that can be provided to the design department to make the appro-
priate changes to the drawing files.
Cadopolis (www.cadopolis.com) and CADdepot (www.caddepot.com) are excellent
Web sites for downloading freeware and shareware utilities that can help improve your
productivity in AutoCAD. Be warned, though: Some of the software that you download
might have stability and compatibility issues and could contain virus, so exercise
some caution.

Appendix A
Glossary
3D solid: An object that is used to create 3D models and can hide objects beyond it in a view-
port. 3D solids are made up with faces, edges, and vertices. 
3D solid model: 3D model that’s created from 3D solids. A 3D solid model is capable of hiding
objects beyond it in a viewport when a visual style is applied or a rendering is created.
attenuation: A property of light that determines how light diminishes the farther it moves
away from the source.
closed 2D object (profile): A 2D object that has a closed boundary, such as a closed 2D poly-
line or circle.
control panel: A subelement of the Dashboard palette used to hold buttons and controls that
are task orientated, such as 3D modeling or rendering. 
Dashboard: A palette designed to allow you to access buttons and controls that are grouped
together by control panels. 
dynamic input tooltip: A user interface feature that allows you to view command prompts,
query and change specific geometry dimensions, input coordinate values, enter both com-
mand names and options, and view the current coordinate value where the crosshairs are
located in tooltips displayed near the crosshairs in the drawing window.
dynamic UCS: A drafting feature that allows you to temporarily define a UCS on the face of a
3D solid. See also user coordinate system (UCS).
edge: The boundary of a face on a 3D solid, surface, or mesh. 
face: An object that is defined by three or four points and is used to create a surface model.
A face is also a subobject of a 3D solid.
M and N directions: Directions in the drawing window used to determine how a matrix for
a 3D mesh is defined. The M and N directions are very similar to the X and Y axes of the
coordinate system.
material: A set of properties used to control the colors and patterns that are applied to a 3D
object during rendering.
mesh: An object that’s defined by a matrix of vertices. A mesh is capable of hiding objects
beyond it and is used to create a surface model. The matrix of vertices is defined by a number
of vertices in the M and N directions of the mesh.
named view: A user-named location in a drawing that can later be restored. When a view is
restored, the drawing is zoomed to match the settings that were saved when the named view
was created. 

open 2D object (profile): A 2D object that doesn’t have a closed boundary, such as
an open 2D polyline or arc.
path: An object or vector used to project an open or closed 2D object to create a 3D
solid, surface, or mesh.
photometric lighting: Lighting that is used to accurately represent lights in the physical
world. 
photometry: The measurement of the intensity of light that is emitted from a source;
how bright a light is.
primitive: A basic 3D geometric shape, such as a box, wedge, or sphere. Primitives can
be created as meshes or as 3D solids.
rendering: The process AutoCAD performs when applying materials to 3D objects and
calculating how light is emitted and shadows are cast in a 3D model. The final output
after a rendering can be to an image file or directly to the drawing window.
subobject: An object that’s defined within a 3D solid: a face, an edge, or a vertex.
surface model: 3D model created from 3D faces, meshes, and surface objects. Surface
models are capable of hiding objects beyond them in a viewport when a visual style is
applied or a rendering is created.
tessellation lines: Lines that appear on a 3D solid to give the appearance of the object
being curved.
user coordinate system (UCS): A user-defined coordinate system that’s used to alter
the orientation of the X, Y, and Z axes. 
vertex: Location where faces on a 3D solid converge to a single point. (Vertices is the
plural form.)
visual style: A set of properties that are used to control how the edges and faces on 3D
objects appear in a viewport.
wireframe model: 3D model that’s defined with by lines and arcs. The lines and arcs
are used to represent the outer edges of the model (or the model’s boundaries). Unlike
surface and 3D solid models, the objects beyond it in the current view still can be seen
due to surfaces not being present in the model.
workspace: A user-defined grouping of user interface elements that is used to control
the display and organization of menus, toolbars, and palettes. Workspaces are often
defined to control the display of task-orientated user interface elements. 
world coordinate system (WCS): A base coordinate system that’s used for all objects
that you create and for user coordinate systems.

Using the DVD
To install the items from the DVD to your hard drive, follow these steps.
1. Insert the DVD into your computer’s DVD drive. The license agreement appears.
The interface won’t launch if you have autorun disabled. In that case, choose Start➪Run.
In the dialog box that appears, type D:\start.exe. (Replace D with the proper letter if
your DVD-ROM drive uses a different letter. If you don’t know the letter, see how your
DVD-ROM drive is listed under My Computer.) Click OK.

2. Read through the license agreement and then click the Accept button if you want
to use the DVD. 
The DVD interface appears. The interface allows you to install the programs and
run the demos with just a click of a button (or two).
What You Can Find on the DVD
The following sections are arranged by category and provide a summary of the software
and other goodies you can find on the DVD. If you need help with installing the items
provided on the DVD, refer to the installation instructions in the preceding section.
Shareware programs are fully functional, free, trial versions of copyrighted programs. If
you like particular programs, register with their authors for a nominal fee and receive
licenses, enhanced versions, and technical support. 
Freeware programs are free, copyrighted games, applications, and utilities. You can copy
them to as many PCs as you like — for free — but they offer no technical support. 
GNU software is governed by its own license, which is included inside the folder of the
GNU software. There are no restrictions on distribution of GNU software. See the GNU
license at the root of the DVD for more details. 
Trial, demo, and evaluation versions of software are usually limited either by time or
functionality (such as not letting you save a project after you create it).
Demonstration files 
All the files required for the exercises in this book are contained in the folder AutoCAD
Workbook. Each folder on the DVD corresponds to a chapter in this book. Before start-
ing any of the exercises in this book, I suggest that you copy the AutoCAD Workbook
folder from the DVD-ROM to the My Documents folder under your user profile on
your computer’s local hard drive. After you copy the folder, rename the folder to My
Practice Drawings.
Here’s how to copy the AutoCAD Workbook folder from the DVD-ROM to your My
Documents folder and then rename it to My Practice Drawings:
1. Insert the DVD-ROM into your computer’s DVD drive.
2. Right-click the Start button on the Windows taskbar and then choose Explore.
3. Use the tree view on the left side of Windows Explorer to locate the drive that
contains the DVD-ROM and then select the drive.
4. On the right side, select the AutoCAD Workbook folder and press Ctrl+C to copy
the folder.
5. In the tree view on the left side of Windows Explorer, select the My Documents
folder and then press Ctrl+V to paste a copy of the AutoCAD Workbook folder
locally on your computer.
348
AutoCAD 2008 3D Modeling Workbook For Dummies 

6. Select the AutoCAD Workbook folder on the right side and press F2 to start the
renaming process of the folder.
7. When the in-place editor appears (a box around the name of the folder with the
name highlighted inside it), type My Practice Drawings and press Enter.
8. Click the X in the upper-right corner of the Windows Explorer window to close it.
After you create a copy of the files locally, you’re ready to start your journey through
this workbook and into the 3D world of modeling that AutoCAD offers.
When you’re done with the workbook and don’t need the practice files any longer, feel
free to either keep them for future reference or delete the My Practice Drawings folder.
You can send the folder and all its files to the Recycle Bin just in case you have a
change of heart about the files, or you can delete them completely by holding down
the Shift key as you delete the folder.
Videos
This DVD contains videos files of select exercises that you can use in conjunction 
with the exercises found in this book. The video files are arranged by chapter; for
example, the videos associated with exercises in Chapter 3 are in the Chapter 3 folder. 
The video files can run directly in Windows Media Player from the DVD, so you don’t
need to copy them from the DVD to your local drive. If you have problems with run-
ning the video files, you might need to install the TechSmith Screen Capture Codec
(TSCC), which is on this DVD. If you have playback issues, the video is choppy, or the
video takes a while to buffer, you might want to consider copying the videos to your
local drive and placing them in a temporary folder that you can delete later.

Appendix B: About the DVD

TechSmith Screen Capture Codec (TSCC), from
TechSmith Corporation 
Commercial version
The videos on the DVD were developed with Camtasia Studio 4 by TechSmith. To prop-
erly view the videos, you need to install the TechSmith Screen Capture Codec. For
more information, on TechSmith and its products, check out www.techsmith.com.
Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile programs that work on most computers with the minimum
system requirements. Alas, your computer might differ, and some programs might not
work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) for the
programs you want to use or you have other programs running that are affecting
installation or running of a program. If you get an error message such as Not enough
memory or Setup cannot continue, try one or more of the following suggestions
and then try using the software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation programs
sometimes mimic virus activity and might make your computer incorrectly believe
that it’s being infected by a virus.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the less
memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typically update
files and programs; so if you keep other programs running, installation might
not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This is,
admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding more
memory can really help the speed of your computer and allow more programs
to run at the same time.
Customer Care
If you have trouble with the DVD, please call the Wiley Product Technical Support
phone number at (800) 762-2974. Outside the United States, call 1(317) 572-3994. You
