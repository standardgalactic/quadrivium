Do you need your email locations to utilize the name of your association, as
@fourthcoffee.com or @contoso.com? Most associations do. You can do this in
Office 365 in the event that you effectively claim an area. (A space is the
contoso.com part of an email address or URL.) In the event that you don't
effectively possess a space, you can utilize the area that you get with Office 365,
which looks something like contoso.onmicrosoft.com. Before you do whatever
else, we prescribe that you choose which space to utilize and afterward make
client accounts (if there's anybody other than you in your association).
Do key tasks

this in Office 365 on the off chance that you effectively possess an area. (A space
is the "contoso.com" some portion of an email address or URL.) If you don't
effectively possess an area, you can utilize the space that you get with Office
365, which looks something like "contoso.onmicrosoft.com". Be that as it may,
in any case, before you do whatever else, we prescribe that you choose which
area to utilize and after that make client accounts (if there's anybody other than
you in your association).

administrations or purchase another area. In case despite everything you're
experimenting with Office 365 or you don't need a custom space, you can simply
continue utilizing your onmicrosoft.com area.
The most ideal approach to begin is to take after the well ordered Domains
Quick start. It strolls you through adding your area to your Office 365 record,
exchanging your Office 365 client ID (which is likewise your email address) to
utilize your space name, and setting up your clients' email addresses with your
space. In the initial 30 days that you utilize Office 365, you'll see interfaces that
will take you to the Domains Quick start at the highest point of the Admin
Overview page. To begin, click Add an area or Add clients. On the off chance
that you'd like this well ordered direction after the initial 30 days, click Users on
the left sheet.
Note :
The Domains Quick start highlight isn't accessible to everybody at this moment.
See the note about the Availability of the Domains Quick start.
Before you begin, look at What do I require before I begin ? To what extent will
it take ? On the off chance that you don't have time for every one of the means
now, don't stress. We'll spare your spot, and you can get up at the progression
where you left off when it works for you.

What information do you have to round up before you begin? Here's a rundown:
Your custom space. This is the area you'll be adding to Office 365. It looks
something like fourthcoffee.com. Try not to have an area? Figure out how to
get one here: Buy an area name.
Your area name recorder login and secret word. This is (normally) where
you purchased your area; for instance, Go Daddy.
Your DNS facilitating supplier login and secret key. This is the place your
DNS records are overseen. It may be the same as your area recorder, yet in
some cases it's an alternate organization. For instance, in the event that you
have your site with another organization, you may likewise deal with your
DNS records with that organization.
A rundown of individuals to add to Office 365. Unless you're the main
individual in your association, you'll likely need to add other individuals to
Office 365 so they can utilize the administration as well.
In the event that you as of now have a site with your space name, for instance,
www.fourthcoffee.com, you'll require this extra data. Try not to stress in the
event that you don't recognize what this is. We can help you find the information
later. This is what you require:
Your site facilitating supplier. This is the place your site is facilitated. This
may be the same organization as your DNS facilitating supplier or your space
enlistment center, however could be another one.
Your site's static IP address. We'll require this to set things up so individuals
can in any case get to your site after you switch your space over to Office
365. On the off chance that your web facilitating supplier doesn't have a static
IP address for your site, you'll utilize a completely qualified area name for
your site.
Your site's completely qualified space name (if necessary). This is another
way that a organization that has your site may recognize your site area, rather
than a static IP address. You don't require both an IP address and a completely
qualified area name, just whichever one your web facilitating supplier has
given you.

To what extent will it take to get your area included and your client messages set
up? Normally around a hour of hands-on time. You'll need to anticipate one
more hour or somewhere in the vicinity (up to 5 hours) for DNS framework
updates to complete the process of changing email over to Office 365. Know that
it can take more time for the DNS framework spread to complete, up to 72
hours, yet that isn't run of the mill.
When you're set, you and other individuals at your association will be good to go
to utilize Office 365 for your email. In the event that you need to move your
email messages from your past framework to Office 365, figure out how to do
that here: Use Outlook to Move Data Between Accounts.
Why do I need to complete these steps ?
In case you're simply looking at Office 365, or on the off chance that you need to
continue utilizing your.onmicrosoft.com area, you can simply include clients and
begin. There's no compelling reason to stroll through these means until you're
prepared to utilize Office 365 for your expert work or your business.
In any case, most organizations and experts need to utilize an email address in
Office 365 that is anything but difficult to recall, particularly for their clients.
This implies having a custom area, as fourthcoffee.com. That is the thing that
these means do—they set up email on your area in Office 365 so you'll be
prepared to go.
Before you can utilize Office 365 with your area, we need to ensure that you
possess it. So that is the initial step you have to finish.
On the off chance that you as of now have a site that is up and running that uses
your custom space, there's an additional progression we'll walk you through.
This progression ensures that individuals can in any case get to your present site
after you include your space. Need the subtle elements? See Why does including
my space influence my present site ?
Another progression is to add clients to Office 365. Why deal with that at this
moment? Since you'll ordinarily need clients to have email addresses that
utilization your custom area, instead of email addresses that utilization

.onmicrosoft.com. In the event that you made clients before you included your
area, you presumably need to change their email from .onmicrosoft.com to your
space. We'll walk you through that.
All the more essentially, if individuals as of now utilize your area for email
outside Office 365, for instance, susan@fourthcoffee.com, you have to add those
email locations to Office 365 preceding you flip the change to wrap up your
space to Office 365. In the event that you don't add them to Office 365 to start
with, any messages sent to those email addresses won't land after you flip the
switch. Not in your old email framework and not in Office 365. So make certain
to include all email addresses that have your space name to Office 365.
The exact opposite thing you do to finish these means is to flip the switch—
change your name server records to indicate Office 365—so that Office 365 will
deal with the DNS records for your area. This lets Office 365 deal with making
the privilege DNS records for your administrations so you'll be good to go to
work with your area in Office 365. It additionally implies that we can set up new
administrations for you as they're added to Office 365 so you don't need to stress
over making additional strides later.
After you flip the switch by changing your name server records to indicate the
Office 365 name servers, Office 365 will deal with the DNS records for your
space rather than your area recorder or your previous DNS facilitating supplier.
This is otherwise called red legation of your space.
Why do I need to verify that I own my domain ?
Before you set up Office 365 to utilize your custom space name, we have to
ensure that you possess the area. Else anybody could utilize any area name they
needed to. For instance, somebody could utilize your area name with Office 365
and say they were you!
So the initial step you have to finish is to demonstrate that you claim your area.

To do this, you make a record for your area at your space enlistment center or
DNS facilitating supplier, and afterward Office 365 searches for that record.
When we discover it, we know you claim the space, since you could sign on to
the site where your space is overseen and make the record we were searching
for.
The DNS records for your space are normally overseen by a similar organization
where you purchased the space, particularly in case you're not utilizing the area
yet for email or a site. Be that as it may, it may be overseen by another
organization; for instance, now and again DNS administration may be moved
when you have a site with another organization. In case you don't know whether
that happened, get in contact with the organization that has your site.
Not certain what DNS is? Look at the data here: Work with area names and DNS
records in Office 365.
I already have a website. Will it move to Office 365 ?
On the off chance that you as of now have a site facilitated outside Office 365,
that is fine. You can continue facilitating your site where it is while you utilize
Office 365 to have your email and also utilize group locales, Lync, et cetera.
When you disclose to us you have a site, we'll walk you through the means to
ensure the right redirection records are set up in Office 365 as a major aspect of
including your area. This ensures individuals can even now get to your site after
you've added your area to Office 365 and have exchanged DNS facilitating over
to Office 365.
What does this need to do with your present site? This is a result of the way
spaces and DNS work. When you flip the change to wrap up your area, Office
365 will begin dealing with your DNS. We do this to ensure your administrations
are set up accurately with the DNS records for Exchange Online, SharePoint
Online, and Lync that are expected to work with your area name. This makes it
considerably more straightforward to get everything set up in Office 365.

Be that as it may, when individuals sort in your site's URL with your custom
space name, the DNS framework, which coordinates organize movement, now
searches for your site at Office 365. Be that as it may, it's not there. It's still
facilitated where you've made them run from the start. We settle that by making
another DNS record, an A record, to go-to people from Office 365 to your site
where it's facilitated outside Office 365.
Why does adding my domain affect my current
website ?
Why does adding your space to Office 365 have anything to do with your
present site? This is a direct result of the way DNS and areas work. When you're
finished including your area, Office 365 will begin dealing with your DNS. We
do this so we can ensure your administrations are set up accurately with the DNS
records for email and different administrations so Office 365 will work with your
area name. 
Having Office 365 oversee DNS for you makes it less difficult for you to utilize
your area with the administrations. Be that as it may, when individuals sort in
your site's URL with your custom space name, the DNS framework, which
coordinates organize movement, now searches for your site at Office 365. In any
case, it's most certainly not. Your site is still facilitated where you've made them
run from the start. We settle that by making a DNS record, an A record, to go-to
people from Office 365 to your site where it's facilitated outside Office 365.
There's an extra stride we walk you through to assemble the required data and
make the record.
That is the reason, when you include your space, we ask you whether you have a
present site. At that point we'll know to get the required data from you later and
make the DNS record to indicate your site.
What if I want to host my website with Office 365 ?

In the event that you don't as of now have a site or on the off chance that you
need to make another one, you can have a site on your space in Office 365 by
utilizing SharePoint Online. While you can't move your present site to Office
365, you can make another site on Office 365 with a comparable look and a
similar usefulness.
Your Office 365 membership incorporates a site on SharePoint Online that you
can tweak and after that host with your area name. For instance, you can include
your association's logo, utilize the hues and design that you need, and the sky is
the limit from there. When you're set, you can switch your area name to utilize
that site.
Need to have your association's site on your area on Office 365? After you've
completed the means to add your space to Office 365, do the accompanying.
1. Redo your Office 365 open confronting site by including your
association's name, logo, and business data. To take in more, see
Customize an open confronting site.
Note :
Make certain to tweak your site before you refresh Office 365 to utilize your
custom space name for your SharePoint Online site. Something else, clients will
see the example site that is furnished with SharePoint Online.
2. On the Admin page, in the left sheet, under Management, click
Domains.
3. Click Change address, and afterward venture through the wizard.
Tips :
On the off chance that you need to keep your present open confronting site that
is facilitated outside Office 365 as opposed to making another open site that uses
your area on SharePoint Online, don't utilize the Change deliver alternative to
guide activity toward your SharePoint Online site.
Rather, ensure your site activity is diverted from Office 365 back to the
facilitating supplier where your site is found. In the event that you noticed that
you needed to keep your current open site when you were venturing through the

Domains Quick start, we as of now made the records for you. If not, you can
refresh the DNS records yourself. To figure out how, see Refresh DNS records to
keep your site with your current facilitating supplier.
When you change your SharePoint Online site to utilize your custom area name,
keep the following as a top priority:
If you set up Office 365 to utilize your custom space name for your
SharePoint Online site, you can undoubtedly change the website later to
utilize another custom area name, or change back to the first area name
that you had; for instance, ontoso.sharepoint.com, by utilizing the Change
address choice. Or, on the other hand later, you can move the site to be
facilitated by another administration outside Office 365.
You can have just a single open confronting site with your Office 365
record. Furthermore, you can divert just a single area to the site.
Some DNS records must be overwritten by Office 365 to change the site to
utilize your custom space name. For instance, on the off chance that you
have a DNS record named www., Office 365 must refresh that record to
indicate SharePoint Online.
What is the IP address for my website? Do I need to
find out the fully qualified domain name too?
In the event that you as of now have a site and need to keep it where it is, while
utilizing your area name with email on Office 365, Office 365 needs to divert
movement to your site. (Why? Look at the prior area that clarifies this: Why do I
have to finish these means ?)
To make the DNS record that ensures individuals can get to your webpage, we
have to know either the IP address of your site or the "completely qualified area
name." We'll utilize this data to indicate your site from Office 365. Which one do
we require? That relies on upon the organization that right now has your site.
Now and again site facilitating suppliers have a solitary "static" IP address that is
special for every site they have; for instance, 192.168.100.1. For this situation,
you'll require the IP address for your site.
Alert :

In the event that your web facilitating supplier provides an IP address for your
site, ensure that it's a static IP. That is, it must be an IP deliver that dependably
indicates your site as opposed to being accessible to be appointed to various site
addresses. The web facilitating organization can affirm this for you.
Now and again as opposed to utilizing static IP addresses, organizations utilize
an alternate method for distinguishing every site: a completely qualified area
name (FQDN). This is not quite the same as your custom space name. This
completely qualified space name is just an address name where a few
organizations have sites. It looks something like this: sites.web facilitating
company.com.
important :
In case you're given a completely qualified space name for your site rather than
an IP address also, we utilize the completely qualified area name to divert
individuals to your site, know that in the event that individuals sort your area
name without including "www.", they won't get to your site. For instance,
http://fourthcoffee.com won't be diverted to http://www.fourthcoffee.com. How
might you settle this? Perceive How would I be able to ensure individuals can
get to my site in the event that they don't sort www ?
How can I make sure people can get to my website if
they don’t type www ?
In the event that you as of now have a site outside Office 365, Office 365 will
divert individuals to your site after the right DNS records are set up. On the off
chance that your site has a static IP address, individuals can at present discover
your site by utilizing the space with or without the "www." in front. For instance,
both http://fourthcoffee.com and http://www.fourthcoffee.com commonly take
you to a fourthcoffee.com site. 
Be that as it may, if Office 365 sidetracks individuals to your site by utilizing a
completely qualified area name rather than an IP address, the one without the
"www." won't work.
Note :
Not certain if your site has an IP address or a completely qualified space name ?
Look at this prior area: What is the IP address for my site? Do I have to discover
the completely qualified area name as well ?

Your web facilitating supplier will give you either a static IP address or a
completely qualified area name that distinguishes your site. In case you're given
a completely qualified area name for your site and we utilize it to divert
individuals to your site, individuals who sort your space name without including
"www." as a component of the name won't get to your site. Why? It needs to do
with the way that basic DNS record redirection works.
To fix this, you can utilize an organization that gives URL redirection
administrations. The organization can give you an Internet connection to divert
individuals to your site by utilizing the completely qualified area name. To take
in more, see Using a URL redirection benefit with Office 365.
How do I use my email address with my domain in
Office 365 ?
After you include your area and we've affirmed that you possess it, you can
change your Office 365 email deliver to utilize your custom space rather than the
.onmicrosoft.com email address. For instance, if your present Office 365 email
address is terry@contoso.onmicrosoft.com and your custom area is
fourthcoffee.com, your new email address would be terry@fourthcoffee.com.
You can simply change this later in the event that you'd rather use, for instance,
terryadams@fourthcoffee.com. After you change your email deliver to utilize
the space you just added to Office 365, you'll sign out and sign back in once
more, and afterward you can utilize your email deliver to send letters.
important :
In spite of the fact that you can send email from your new email address when
you transform it, and at that point sign out and sign back in, you can't get email
sent to that email address in Office 365 until you finish the last stride to flip the
switch and change your name server records to indicate the Office 365 name
servers. Try not to stress. Email sent to the email address that has your custom
space name won't be lost. Email will keep on going to your present email
framework until you finish the switchover.
Why should I add users now ?
You can add clients to Office 365 whenever. Why do it now? You need to

include email addresses that are as of now utilizing your area name to Office 365
preceding you flip the change to wrap up your space to Office 365. Furthermore,
you'll normally need individuals in your association to have email addresses that
utilization your custom space, as opposed to email addresses with
.onmicrosoft.com in them. On the off chance that individuals are as of now
utilizing email addresses with your custom area name with your present email
framework, as susan@fourthcoffee.com, you'll presumably need them to have a
similar email addresses in Office 365. That gives coherence to the general
population in your association, for your clients, and others. 
On the off chance that you made clients in Office 365 preceding you included
your space, we'll walk you through changing those clients to email addresses that
utilization your area name. Consider the possibility that you haven't included an
email address that uses your space name and you change your. area's name
server records to indicate the Office 365 name servers? In the event that you do
that, any messages sent to that email address won't arrive. Not in the individual's
present email framework and not in Office 365. So make sure to include all
email addresses with your space name to Office 365 preceding you flip the
switch!
Until you flip the switch, individuals will keep on receiving email sent to those
email addresses wherever they presently get email. Simply after you've finished
these means and the name server records indicate Office 365 will email that is
sent to your space start touching base in Office 365.
What happens when I flip the switch to Office 365 at
the end of the Domains Quick start ?
The last stride in getting Office 365 set up with your area name is to flip the
switch and change the name server records for your space to utilize the Office
365 name server records. You roll out this improvement at your area enlistment
center site. When you've rolled out the improvement and the refreshed name

server records have proliferated through the DNS framework, you're finished!
Your space is added to Office 365 and is prepared to use with Office 365
administrations.
What precisely does this change do? In specialized terms, changing your area's
name server records to indicate another arrangement of name servers is called
red legating your area. In spite of the fact that your space is red legated to Office
365, the area name is as yet enrolled with your area enlistment center, so you'll
have to continue restoring your area there. But since the area is red legated,
Office 365 now deals with your DNS records for you, including setting up your
Office 365 administrations, for example, email and group locales.
important :
It would be ideal if you recall! In spite of the fact that you've design your area to
work with the Office 365 administrations, you can't give your space a chance to
lapse by not paying your area name enlistment center. On the off chance that you
don't restore your space enrollment, your Office 365 administrations won't work.
For case, email won't be conveyed and Lync Online won't work. Your space
name recorder will disclose to you when your space enrollment is going to
terminate.
Until you change your name server records, email addresses in Office 365 that
utilization your area name, for instance, susan@fourthcoffee.com, will in any
case get email messages in their past email framework. Tell individuals when
you're going to do the switch, so they'll go to Office 365 to discover their email
when it quits touching base in their present email framework. Only an update:
make certain that you've included all the email addresses that utilization your
space to Office 365 preceding you switch over! Where would you be able to
discover your email in Office 365? Look at this data about utilizing Outlook
Web App: Set up and get to email utilizing your web program. You can likewise
set up your Outlook program on your PC to utilize email in Office 365. For more
information, see Connect Outlook to Your Account.
