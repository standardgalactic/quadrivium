electronic principles, ways of generating electricity –
the present and the future (including more on renew-
able energy), more on lithium-ion batteries, along with
other minor modiﬁcations.
The text is set out in ﬁve parts as follows:
PART 1, comprising chapters 1 to 12, involves Revision
of some Basic Mathematics needed for Electrical and
Electronic Principles.
PART 2, involving chapters 3 to 14, contains Basic
Electrical Engineering Principles which any student
wishing to progress in electrical engineeringwould need
to know. An introduction to units, electrical circuits,
resistance variation, batteries and alternative sources
of energy, series and parallel circuits, capacitors and
capacitance, magnetic circuits, electromagnetism, elec-
tromagnetic induction, electrical measuringinstruments
and measurements, semiconductor diodes and transis-
tors are all included in this section.
PART 3, involving chapters 15 to 25, contains Electri-
cal Principles and Technology suitable for National

circuit theory, alternating voltages and currents, single-
phase series and parallel circuits, d.c. transients,
operational ampliﬁers, ways of generating electricity,
three-phase systems, transformers, d.c. machines and
three-phase induction motors are all included in this
section.
PART 4, involving chapters 26 to 48, contains
Advanced Circuit Theory and Technology suitable
for Degree, Foundationdegree, Higher National Certiﬁ-
cate/Diploma and City and Guilds courses in electrical
and electronic/telecommunications engineering. The
three earlier sections of the book will provide a valuable
reference/revision for students at this level.

PART 5 provides a short General Reference for stan-
dard electrical quantities – their symbols and units, the
Greek alphabet, common preﬁxes and resistor colour
coding and ohmic values.
At the beginning of each of the 48 chapters a brief
explanation as to why it is important to understand
the material contained within that chapter is included,
together with a list of learning objectives.
At the end of each of the ﬁrst four parts of the text is a
handy reference of the main formulae used.
There are a number of Internet downloads freely avail-
able to both students and lecturers/instructors; these are
listed on page xiii.
It is not possible to acquire a thorough understanding
of electrical principles, circuit theory and technology
without working through a large number of numerical
problems. It is for this reason that Electrical Circuit
Theory and Technology 6th Edition contains nearly 800
detailed worked problems, together with some 1350
further problems (with answers at the back of the
book), arranged within 202 Practice Exercises that
appear every few pages throughout the text. Some 1153
line diagrams further enhance the understanding of the
theory.

Fourteen Revision Tests have been included, inter-
spersed within the text every few chapters. For example,
Revision Test 1 tests understanding of chapters 3 to
6, Revision Test 2 tests understanding of chapters 7
to 9, Revision Test 3 tests understanding of chapters
10 to 14, and so on. These Revision Tests do not have
answersgivensinceitisenvisagedthatlecturers/instruc-
tors could set the Revision Tests for students to attempt
as part of their course structure. Lecturers/instructors
may obtain a complimentary set of solutions ofthe Revi-
sion Tests in an Instructor’s Manual available from the

Part 1
Revision of some basic
mathematics


Chapter 1
Some mathematics revision
Why it is important to understand: Some mathematics revision
Mathematics is a vital tool for professional and chartered engineers. It is used in electrical and
electronic engineering, in mechanical and manufacturing engineering, in civil and structural engi-
neering, in naval architecture and marine engineering and in aeronautical and rocket engineering. In
these various branches of engineering, it is very often much cheaper and safer to design your arte-
fact with the aid of mathematics – rather than through guesswork. ‘Guesswork’ may be reasonably
satisfactory if you are designing an exactly similar artefact as one that has already proven satisfac-
tory; however, the classiﬁcation societies will usually require you to provide the calculations proving
that the artefact is safe and sound. Moreover, these calculations may not be readily available to you
and you may have to provide fresh calculations, to prove that your artefact is ‘roadworthy’. For
example, if you design a tall building or a long bridge by ‘guesswork’, and the building or bridge
do not prove to be structurally reliable, it could cost you a fortune to rectify the deﬁciencies. This
cost may dwarf the initial estimate you made to construct these structures, and cause you to go
bankrupt. Thus, without mathematics, the prospective professional or chartered engineer is very severely
disadvantaged.
Knowledge of mathematics provides the basis for all engineering.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
use a calculator and evaluate formulae
•
manipulate fractions
•
understand and perform calculations with percentages
•
appreciate ratios and direct and inverse proportion
•
understand and use the laws of indices
•
expand equations containing brackets
•
solve simple equations
•
transpose formulae
•
solve simultaneous equations in two unknowns

1.1 Use of calculator and evaluating
formulae
In engineering,calculations often need to be performed.
For simple numbers it is useful to be able to use men-
tal arithmetic. However, when numbers are larger an
electronic calculator needs to be used.
In engineering calculations it is essential to have a
scientiﬁc notation calculator which will have all the
necessary functions needed, and more. This chapter
assumes you have a CASIO fx-991ES PLUS calcu-
lator, or similar. If you can accurately use a calcula-
tor, your conﬁdence with engineering calculations will
improve.
Check that you can use a calculator in the following

Evaluation of formulae
The statement y = mx + c is called a formula for y in
terms of m, x and c.
y, m, x and c are called symbols.
When given values of m, x and c we can evaluate y.
There are a large number of formulae used in engineer-
ing and in this section we will insert numbers in place
of symbols to evaluate engineering quantities.
Here are some practical examples. Check with your
calculator that you agree with the working and answers.
Problem 1.
In an electrical circuit the voltage V
is given by Ohm’s law, i.e. V=IR. Find, correct to
4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the voltage when I = 5.36 A
and R = 14.76
V = IR = I × R = 5.36 × 14.76
Hence, voltage V=79.11 V, correct to 4 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures
Problem 2.
Velocity v is given by v = u + at. If
u = 9.54m/s, a = 3.67m/s2 and t = 7.82s, ﬁnd v,
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
v = u + at = 9.54+ 3.67 × 7.82
= 9.54+ 28.6994 = 38.2394
Hence, velocity v=38.2 m/s, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures
Problem 3.
The area, A, of a circle is given by
A = πr2. Determine the area correct to 2 decimal
places, given radius r = 5.23m.
A = πr2 = π(5.23)2 = π(27.3529)
Hence,area,A=85.93m2,correctto2decimalplaces
Problem 4.
Density =
mass
volume. Find the density
when the mass is 6.45 kg and the volume is
300 × 10−6m3.
Density =
mass
volume=
6.45kg
300 × 10−6m3 =21500kg/m3
Problem 5.
The power, P watts, dissipated in an
electrical circuit is given by the formula P = V2
R .
Evaluate the power, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
given that V = 230V and R = 35.63
P = V2
R = (230)2
35.63 = 52900
35.63 = 1484.70390...
Press ENG and 1.48470390.. × 103 appears on the
screen
Hence, power, P=1485 W or 1.485 kW correct to 4
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Problem 6.
Resistance, R , varies with
temperature according to the formula
R = R0(1 + αt). Evaluate R, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, given R0 = 14.59, α = 0.0043 and t = 80
R = R0(1 + αt) = 14.59[1 + (0.0043)(80)]
= 14.59(1 + 0.344) = 14.59(1.344)
Hence, resistance, R=19.6 , correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures
Problem 7.
The current, I amperes, in an a.c.
circuit is given by: I =
V

(R2 + X2)
Evaluate the
current, correct to 2 decimal places, when
V = 250V, R = 25.0 and X = 18.0
I=

1.2 Fractions
An example of a fraction is 2
3 where the top line, i.e. the
2, is referred to as the numerator and the bottom line,
i.e. the 3, is referred to as the denominator.
A proper fraction is one where the numerator is
smaller than the denominator, examples being 2
3, 1
2,
3
8, 5
16, and so on.
An improper fraction is one where the denominator
is smaller than the numerator, examples being 3
2, 2
1, 8
3,
16
5 , and so on.
Addition of fractions is demonstrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 8.
Evaluate A, given A = 1
2 + 1
3
The lowest common denominator of the two denomina-
tors 2 and 3 is 6, i.e. 6 is the lowest number that both 2
and 3 will divide into.
Then 1
2 = 3
6 and 1
3 = 2
6 i.e. both 1
2 and 1
3 have the
common denominator, namely 6.
The two fractions can therefore be added as:
A = 1
2 + 1
3 = 3
6 + 2
6 = 3 + 2
6
= 5
6
Problem 9.
Evaluate A, given A = 2
3 + 3
4
A common denominator can be obtained by multiply-
ing the two denominators together, i.e. the common
denominator is 3 × 4 = 12
The two fractions can now be made equivalent, i.e.
2
3 = 8
12 and 3
4 = 9
12
so that they can be easily added together, as follows:
A = 2
3 + 3
4 = 8
12 + 9
12 = 8 + 9
12
= 17
12
i.e. A = 2
3 + 3
4 = 1 5
12
Problem 10.
Evaluate A, given A = 1
6 + 2
7 + 3
2
A suitable common denominator can be obtained by
multiplying 6 × 7 = 42, and all three denominators
divide exactly into 42.
Thus,
1
6 = 7
42, 2
7 = 12
42 and 3
2 = 63
42
Hence,
A = 1
6 + 2
7 + 3
2 = 7
42 + 12
42 + 63
42
= 7 + 12+ 63
42
= 82
42 = 41
21
i.e.
A = 1
6 + 2
7 + 3
2 = 120
21
Problem 11.
Determine A as a single fraction,
given A = 1
x + 2
y
A commondenominatorcan be obtainedby multiplying
the two denominators together, i.e. xy
Thus,
1
x = y
xy and 2
y = 2x
xy
Hence, A = 1
x + 2
y = y
xy + 2x
xy i.e. A = y + 2x
xy
Note that addition, subtraction, multiplication and divi-
sion of fractions may be determined using a calculator
(for example, the CASIO fx-991ES PLUS).

1.3 Percentages
Percentages are used to give a common standard. The
use of percentages is very common in many aspects
of commercial life, as well as in engineering. Interest
rates, sale reductions, pay rises, exams and VAT are all
examples where percentages are used.
Percentagesare fractions having 100 as their denom-
inator.
For example, the fraction 40
100 is written as 40% and
is read as ‘forty per cent’.
The easiest way to understand percentages is to go
through some worked examples.
Problem 14.

Problem 17.
In two successive tests a student
gains marks of 57/79 and 49/67. Is the second mark
better or worse than the ﬁrst?
57/79 = 57
79 = 57
79 × 100% = 5700
79 %
= 72.15% correct to 2 decimal places.
49/67 = 49
67 = 49
67 × 100% = 4900
67 %
= 73.13% correct to 2 decimal places
Hence, the second test mark is marginally better than
the ﬁrst test.
This question demonstrates how much easier it is
to compare two fractions when they are expressed as
percentages.

Problem 21.
A 160 GB iPod is advertised as
costing £190 excluding VAT. If VAT is added at
20%, what will be the total cost of the iPod?
VAT = 20% of £190 = 20
100 × 190 = £38
Total cost of iPod = £190 + £38 = £228
A quicker method to determine the total cost is:
1.20 × £190 = £228

1.4 Ratio and proportion
Ratios
Ratio is a way of comparing amounts of something; it
shows how much bigger one thing is than the other.
Ratios are generally shown as numbers separated by a
colon ( : ) so the ratio of 2 and 7 is written as 2:7 and
we read it as a ratio of ‘two to seven’.

more about ratios.
Problem 25.
In a class, the ratio of female to
male students is 6:27. Reduce the ratio to its
simplest form.
Both 6 and 27 can be divided by 3
Thus, 6:27 is the same as 2:9
6:27 and 2:9 are called equivalent ratios.
It is normal to express ratios in their lowest, or simplest,
form. In this example, the simplest form is 2:9 which
means for every 2 females in the class there are 9 male
students.
Problem 26.
A gear wheel having 128 teeth is in
mesh with a 48 tooth gear. What is the gear ratio?
Gear ratio=128:48
A ratio can be simpliﬁed by ﬁnding common factors.
128 and 48 can both be divided by 2, i.e. 128:48 is the
same as 64:24
64 and 24 can both be divided by 8, i.e. 64:24 is the
same as 8:3
There is no number that divides completely into both 8
and 3 so 8:3 is the simplest ratio, i.e. the gear ratio is
8:3
128:48 is equivalent to 64:24 which is equivalent to 8:3
8:3 is the simplest form.

Problem 27.
A wooden pole is 2.08 m long.
Divide it in the ratio of 7 to 19.
Since the ratio is 7:19, the total number of parts is
7 + 19 = 26 parts
26 parts corresponds to 2.08 m=208 cm, hence, 1 part
corresponds to 208
26 = 8
Thus, 7 parts corresponds to 7 × 8 = 56cm,
and 19 parts corresponds to 19 × 8 = 152cm
Hence, 2.08 m divides in the ratio of 7:19 as 56 cm
to 152 cm
(Check: 56 + 152 must add up to 208, otherwise an
error would have been made.)
Problem 28.
Express 45 p as a ratio of £7.65 in
its simplest form.
Changingboth quantities to the same units, i.e. to pence,
gives a ratio of 45:765
Dividing both quantities by 5 gives: 45:765 ≡9:153
Dividing both quantities by 3 gives: 9:153 ≡3:51
Dividing both quantities by 3 again gives: 3:51 ≡1:17
Thus, 45p as a ratio of £7.65 is 1:17
45:765, 9:153, 3:51 and 1:17 are equivalent ratios and
1:17 is the simplest ratio

(a)
the value of strain when the stress is 42 MPa
(b)
the value of stress when the strain is 0.00072
(a)
Stress is directly proportional to strain.
When the stress is 63 MPa, the strain is 0.0003,
hence a stress of 1 MPa corresponds to a strain
of 0.0003
63
and the value of strain when the stress is
42 MPa = 0.0003
63

Determine

the current when the voltage is 60 mV
(b)
the voltage when the current is 4.2 A
(a)
Current is directly proportional to the voltage.
When voltage is 90 mV, the current is 3 A,
hence a voltage of 1 mV corresponds to a current
of 3
90 A
and when the voltage is 60 mV,
the current = 60 × 3
90 = 2A
(b)
Voltage is directly proportional to the current.
When current is 3 A, the voltage is 90 mV,
hence a current of 1 A corresponds to a voltage of
90
3 mV = 30 mV

Inverse proportion
Two variables, x and y, are in inverse proportion to one
another if y is proportional to 1
x, i.e. y α 1
x or y = k
x or
k = xy where k is a constant, called the coefﬁcient of
proportionality.
Inverse proportion means that as the value of one vari-
able increases, the value of another decreases, and that
their product is always the same.
Here are some worked examples on inverse propor-
tion.
Problem 34.
It is estimated that a team of four
designers would take a year to develop an
engineering process. How long would three

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Law 1: When multiplying two or more numbers
having the same base, the indices are added.
For example, 22 × 23 = 22+3 = 25
and 54 × 52 × 53 = 54+2+3 = 59
More generally, am × an = am+n
For example, a3 × a4 = a3+4 = a7
Law 2: When dividing two numbers having the same
base,theindexinthedenominatorissubtractedfrom
the index in the numerator.
For example, 25
23 = 25−3 = 22 and 78
75 = 78−5 = 73
More generally, am
an = am−n
For example, c5
c2 = c5−2 = c3
Law 3: When a number which is raised to a power is
raised to a further power, the indices are multiplied.
Forexample,

223 = 22×3 = 26 and

342 = 34×2 = 38
More generally, (am)n = amn
For example,

d25 = d2×5 = d10
Law 4: When a number has an index of 0, its value
is 1.
For example, 30 = 1 and 170 = 1
More generally, a0 = 1
Law 5: A number raised to a negative power is the
reciprocal of that number raised to a positive power.
For example, 3−4 = 1
34 and
1
2−3 = 23
More generally, a−n = 1
an For example, a−2 = 1
a2
Law 6: When a number is raised to a fractional
power the denominator of the fraction is the root
of the number and the numerator is the power.
For example, 8

3 =
3√
82 = (2)2 = 4

1.6 Brackets
The use of brackets, which are used in many engineering
equations, is explained through the following worked
problems.
Problem 48.
Expand the bracket to determine A,
given A = a(b + c + d)
Multiplying each term in the bracket by ‘a’ gives:
A = a(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad
Problem 49.
Expand the brackets to determine A,
given A = a[b(c + d) −e(f −g)]
When there is more than one set of brackets the
innermost brackets are multiplied out ﬁrst. Hence,
A = a[b(c + d) −e(f −g)] = a[bc + bd −ef + eg]
Note that – e × −g = +eg
Now multiplying each term in the square brackets by
‘a’ gives:
A = abc + abd −aef + aeg
Problem 50.
Expand the brackets to determine A,
given A = a[b(c + d −e) −f(g −h{j −k})]
The inner brackets are determined ﬁrst, hence
A = a[b(c + d −e) −f(g −h{j −k})]
= a[b(c + d −e) −f(g −hj+ hk)]
= a[bc + bd −be −fg+ fhj −fhk]
i.e. A = abc + abd −abe −afg + afhj−afhk
Problem 51.
Evaluate A, given
A = 2[3(6 −1) −4(7{2+ 5} −6)]
A = 2[3(6 −1) −4(7{2+ 5} −6)]
= 2[3(6 −1) −4(7 × 7 −6)]
= 2[3 × 5 −4× 43]
= 2[15 −172] = 2[−157] = −314

1.7 Solving simple equations
To ‘solve an equation’ means ‘to ﬁnd the value of the
unknown’.

Part 1
Some mathematics revision
17
Here are some examples to demonstrate how simple
equations are solved.
Problem 52.
Solve the equation: 4x = 20
Dividing each side of the equation by 4 gives: 4x
4 = 20
4
i.e.
x = 5 by cancelling
which is the solution to the equation 4x = 20
The same operation must be applied to both sides of an
equation so that the equality is maintained.
We can do anything we like to an equation, as long as
we do the same to both sides.
Problem 53.
Solve the equation: 2x
5 = 6
Multiplying both sides by 5 gives: 5
2x
5

= 5(6)
Cancelling and removing brackets gives: 2x = 30
Dividing both sides of the equationby 2 gives: 2x
2 = 30
2
Cancelling gives: x = 15
which is the solution of the equation 2x
5 = 6
Problem 54.
Solve the equation: a −5 = 8
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives:
a −5 + 5 = 8 + 5
i.e.
a = 8 + 5
i.e.
a = 13
which is the solution of the equation a −5 = 8
Note that adding 5 to both sides of the above equation
results in the ‘−5’ moving from the LHS to the RHS,
but the sign is changed to ‘+’
Problem 55.
Solve the equation: x + 3 = 7
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives: x + 3 −3 = 7 −3
i.e.
x = 7 −3
i.e.
x = 4
which is the solution of the equation x + 3 = 7
Note that subtracting 3 from both sides of the above
equation results in the ‘+3’ moving from the LHS to
the RHS, but the sign is changed to ‘−’
So we can move straight from x + 3 = 7 to: x = 7 −3
Thus a term can be moved from one side of an equation
to the other as long as a change in sign is made.
Problem 56.
Solve the equation: 6x + 1 = 2x + 9
In such equations the terms containing x are grouped
on one side of the equation and the remaining terms
grouped on the other side of the equation. As in Prob-
lems 54 and 55, changing from one side of an equation
to the other must be accompanied by a change of sign.
Since
6x + 1 = 2x + 9
then
6x −2x = 9 −1
i.e.
4x = 8
Dividing both sides by 4 gives: 4x
4 = 8
4
Cancelling gives: x = 2
which is the solution of the equation 6x + 1 = 2x + 9
In the above examples, the solutions can be checked.
Thus, in problem 56, where 6x + 1 = 2x + 9, if x = 2
then:
LHS of equation = 6(2) + 1 = 13
RHS of equation = 2(2) + 9 = 13
Since the left hand side equals the right hand side then
x = 2 must be the correct solution of the equation.
When solving simple equations, always check your
answers by substituting your solution back into the
original equation.
Problem 57.
Solve the equation: 3(x −2) = 9
Removing the bracket gives: 3x −6 = 9
Rearranging gives: 3x = 9 + 6
i.e.
3x = 15
Dividing both sides by 3 gives: x = 5
which is the solution of the equation 3(x −2) = 9
The equation may be checkedbysubstitutingx = 5 back
into the original equation.
Problem 58.
Solve the equation:
4(2r −3) −2(r −4) = 3(r −3) −1
Removing brackets gives:
8r −12 −2r + 8 = 3r −9 −1
Rearranging gives: 8r −2r −3r = −9 −1 + 12−8
i.e.
3r = −6
Dividing both sides by 3 gives: r = −6
3 = −2
which is the solution of the equation
4(2r −3) −2(r −4) = 3(r −3) −1

Problem 59.
Solve the equation: 4
x = 2
5
The lowest common multiple (LCM) of the denomina-
tors, i.e. the lowest algebraic expression that both x and
5 will divide into, is 5x
Multiplying both sides by 5x gives: 5x
4
x

= 5x
2
5

Cancelling gives: 5(4) = x(2)
i.e.
20 = 2x
(1)
Dividing both sides by 2 gives: 20
2 = 2x
2
Cancelling gives: 10 = x or x = 10
which is the solution of the equation 4
x = 2
5
When there is just one fraction on each side of the equa-
tion as in this example, there is a quick way to arrive
at equation (1) without needing to ﬁnd the LCM of the
denominators.
We can move from 4
x = 2
5 to: 4 × 5 = 2 × x
by what is called ‘cross-multiplication’.
In general, if a
b = c
d then: ad = bc
We can use cross-multiplication when there is one
fraction only on each side of the equation.
Problem 60.
Solve the equation:
2y
5 + 3
4 + 5 = 1
20 −3y
2
The lowest common multiple (LCM) of the denomina-
tors is 20, i.e. the lowest number that 4, 5, 20 and 2 will
divide into.

Cancelling gives: 4(2y) + 5(3) + 100 = 1 −10(3y)
i.e.
8y + 15 + 100 = 1 −30y
Rearranging gives: 8y + 30y = 1 −15 −100
i.e.
38y = −114
Dividing both sides by 38 gives: 38y
38 = −114

Cancelling gives: y = −3
which is the solution of the equation

Problem 61.

d = 4

1.8 Transposing formulae
There are no new rules for transposing formulae.
The same rules as were used for simple equations
are used, i.e. the balance of an equation must be
maintained.
Here are some worked examples to help understand-
ing of transposing formulae.
Problem 63.
Transpose p = q + r + s to make r
the subject
The object is to obtain r on its own on the left-hand side
(LHS) of the equation. Changing the equation around
so that r is on the LHS gives:
q + r + s = p
(1)
From the previous chapter on simple equations, a term
can be moved from one side of an equation to the other
side as long as the sign is changed.
Rearranging gives:
r = p −q −s
Mathematically, we have subtracted q+s from both
sides of equation (1)
Problem 64.
Transpose v = fλ to make λ the
subject
v = fλ relates velocity v, frequency f and wavelength λ
Rearranging gives:
fλ = v
Dividing both sides by f gives:
fλ
f = v
f
Cancelling gives:
λ = v
f
Problem 65.
When a body falls freely through a
height h, the velocity v is given by v2 = 2gh.
Express this formula with h as the subject.
Rearranging gives:
2gh = v2
Dividing both sides by 2g gives:
2gh
2g = v2
2g
Cancelling gives:
h = v2
2g
Problem 66.

Problem 67.
Rearrange the formula R = ρL
A to
make (i) A the subject, and (ii) L the subject
R = ρL
A relates resistance R of a conductor, resistiv-

(i)
Rearranging gives:
ρL
A = R
Multiplying both sides by A gives:
A
ρL
A

Cancelling gives:
ρL = AR
Rearranging gives:
AR = ρl
Dividing both sides by R gives:

R = ρL
R
Cancelling gives:
A = ρL
R
(ii)
Multiplying both sides of ρL
A = R by A gives:
ρL = AR
Dividing both sides by ρ gives: ρL
ρ = AR
ρ
Cancelling gives:
L = AR

Problem 68.
Transpose y = mx + c to make m
the subject
y = mx + cistheequationofastraightlinegraph,where
y is the vertical axis variable, x is the horizontal axis
variable, m is the gradient of the graph and c is the
y-axis intercept.
Subtracting c from both sides gives:
y −c = mx
or
mx = y −c
Dividing both sides by x gives:
m = y −c
x
Problem 69.
The ﬁnal length, L2 of a piece of
wire heated through θ ◦C is given by the formula
L2 = L1(1 + αθ) where L1 is the original length.
Make the coefﬁcient of expansion, α, the subject.
Rearranging gives:
L1(1 + αθ) = L2
Removing the bracket gives:
L1 + L1αθ = L2
Rearranging gives:
L1αθ = L2 −L1
Dividing both sides by L1θ gives:
L1αθ
L1θ = L2 −L1
L1θ
Cancelling gives:
α = L2 −L1
L1θ
An alternative method of transposing L2 = L1 (1 + αθ)
for α is shown below.
Dividing both sides by L1 gives: L2
L1
= 1 + αθ
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives: L2
L1
−1 = αθ
or
αθ = L2
L1
−1

−1
θ

L1θ
and α =
L2

look
quite different. They are, however, equivalent. The ﬁrst
answer looks tidier but is no more correct than the
second answer.
Problem 70.
A formula for the distance s moved
by a body is given by: s = 1
2(v + u)t. Rearrange the
formula to make u the subject.
Rearranging gives:
1
2(v + u)t = s
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
(v + u)t = 2s
Dividing both sides by t gives:
(v + u)t
t
= 2s
t
Cancelling gives:
v + u = 2s
t
Rearranging gives:
u = 2s
t −v or u = 2s −vt

1.9 Solving simultaneous equations
The solution of simultaneous equations is demonstrated
in the following worked problems.
Problem 73.
If 6 apples and 2 pears cost £1.80
and 8 apples and 6 pears cost £2.90, calculate how
much an apple and a pear each cost.
Let an apple=A and a pear=P, then:
6A + 2P = 180
(1)
8A + 6P = 290
(2)
From equation (1), 6A = 180 −2P
and
A = 180 −2P
6
= 30 −0.3333P
(3)
From equation (2), 8A = 290 −6P
and
A = 290 −6P
8
= 36.25 −0.75P
(4)
Equating (3) and (4) gives:
30 −0.3333P = 36.25 −0.75P
i.e.
0.75P −0.3333P = 36.25 −30
and
0.4167P = 6.25
and
P =
6.25
0.4167 = 15

Part 1
22
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Substituting in (3) gives:
A = 30 −0.3333(15) = 30 −5 = 25
Hence, an apple costs 25p and a pear costs 15p
The above method of solving simultaneous equations is
called the substitution method.
Problem 74.
If 6 bananas and 5 peaches cost
£3.45 and 4 bananas and 8 peaches cost £4.40,
calculate how much a banana and a peach each cost.
Let a banana=B and a peach=P, then:
6B + 5P = 345
(1)
4B + 8P = 440
(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by 2 gives:
12B + 10P = 690
(3)
Multiplying equation (2) by 3 gives:
12B + 24P = 1320
(4)
Equation (4) – equation (3) gives: 14P = 630
from which,
P = 630
14 = 45
Substituting in (1) gives:
6B + 5(45) = 345
i.e.
6B = 345 −5(45)
i.e.
6B = 120
and
B = 120
6
= 20
Hence, a banana costs 20p and a peach costs 45p
The above method of solving simultaneous equations is
called the elimination method.
Problem 75.
If 20 bolts and 2 spanners cost £10,
and 6 spanners and 12 bolts cost £18, how much
does a spanner and a bolt cost?
Let s=a spanner and b=a bolt.
Therefore,
2s + 20b = 10
(1)
and
6s + 12b = 18
(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by 3 gives:
6s + 60b = 30
(3)
Equation (3) – equations (2) gives: 48b = 12
from which,
b = 12
48 = 0.25
Substituting in (1) gives:
2s + 20(0.25) = 10
i.e.
2s = 10 −20(0.25)
i.e.
2s = 5
and
s = 5
2 = 2.5
Therefore, a spanner costs £2.50 and a bolt costs £0.25
or 25p

Why it is important to understand: Further mathematics revision
There are an enormous number of uses of trigonometry; ﬁelds that use trigonometry include astron-
omy (especially for locating apparent positions of celestial objects, in which spherical trigonometry is
essential) and hence navigation (on the oceans, in aircraft, and in space), electrical engineering, music
theory, electronics, medical imaging (CAT scans and ultrasound), number theory (and hence cryptology),
oceanography, land surveying and geodesy (a branch of earth sciences), architecture, mechanical engi-
neering, civil engineering, computer graphics and game development. It is clear that a good knowledge
of trigonometry is essential in many ﬁelds of engineering.
All types of engineers use natural and common logarithms. In electrical engineering, a dB (decibel) scale
is very useful for expressing attenuations in radio propagation and circuit gains, and logarithms are used
for implementing arithmetic operations in digital circuits. Exponential functions are used in engineer-
ing, physics, biology and economics. There are many quantities that grow exponentially; some examples
are population, compound interest and charge in a capacitor. There is also exponential decay; some
examples include radioactive decay, atmospheric pressure, Newton’s law of cooling and linear expan-
sion. Understanding and using logarithms and exponential functions are important in many branches of
engineering.
Graphs have a wide range of applications in engineering and in physical sciences because of their inherent
simplicity. A graph can be used to represent almost any physical situation involving discrete objects and
the relationship among them. If two quantities are directly proportional and one is plotted against the
other, a straight line is produced. Examples of this include an applied force on the end of a spring plotted
against spring extension, the speed of a ﬂywheel plotted against time, and strain in a wire plotted against
stress (Hooke’s law). In engineering, the straight line graph is the most basic graph to draw and evaluate.
When designing a new building, or seeking planning permission, it is often necessary to specify the total
ﬂoor area of the building. In construction, calculating the area of a gable end of a building is important
when determining the number of bricks and mortar to order. When using a bolt, the most important thing
is that it is long enough for your particular application and it may also be necessary to calculate the
shear area of the bolt connection. Arches are everywhere, from sculptures and monuments to pieces
of architecture and strings on musical instruments; ﬁnding the height of an arch or its cross-sectional
area is often required. Determining the cross-sectional areas of beam structures is vitally important in
design engineering. There are thus a large number of situations in engineering where determining area
is important. The ﬂoodlit area at a football ground, the area an automatic garden sprayer sprays and
the angle of lap of a belt drive all rely on calculations involving the arc of a circle. The ability to handle
calculations involving circles and their properties is clearly essential in several branches of engineering
design.

2.2 Measurement of angles
Angles are measured starting from the horizontal ‘x’
axis, in an anticlockwise direction, as shown by θ1 to
θ4 in Figure 2.1. An angle can also be measured in a
clockwise direction, as shown by θ5 in Figure 2.1, but
in this case the angle has a negative sign before it. If, for
example, θ4 = 320◦then θ5 = −40◦
Figure 2.1
Problem 3.
Use a calculator to determine the
cosine, sine and tangent of the following angles,
each measured anticlockwise from the horizontal
‘x’ axis, each correct to 4 decimal places:
(a) 30◦
(b) 120◦
(c) 250◦
(d) 320◦
(e) 390◦
(f) 480◦
(a)
cos30◦= 0.8660
sin30◦= 0.5000
tan30◦= 0.5774
(b)
cos120◦= −0.5000
sin120◦= 0.8660
tan120◦= −1.7321
(c)
cos250◦= −0.3420
sin250◦= −0.9397
tan250◦= 2.7475
(d)
cos320◦= 0.7660
sin320◦= −0.6428
tan320◦= −0.8391
(e)
cos390◦= 0.8660
sin390◦= 0.5000
tan390◦= 0.5774
(f)
cos480◦= −0.5000
sin480◦= 0.8660
tan480◦= −1.7321
These angles are now drawn in Figure 2.2. Note that the
cosine and sine of angles always lie between −1 and
+1, but that tangent values can be > 1 and < 1.
Figure 2.2
Note from Figure 2.2 that θ = 30◦is the same as
θ = 390◦and so are their cosines, sines and tangents.
Similarly, note that θ = 120◦is the same as θ = 480◦
and so are their cosines, sines and tangents. Also, note
that θ = −40◦is the same as θ = +320◦and so are their
cosines, sines and tangents.
It is noted from above that
•
in the ﬁrst quadrant, i.e. where θ varies from 0◦to
90◦, all (A) values of cosine, sine and tangent are
positive
•
in the second quadrant, i.e. where θ varies from90◦
to 180◦, only values of sine (S) are positive
•
in the third quadrant, i.e. where θ varies from 180◦
to 270◦, only values of tangent (T) are positive
•
in the fourth quadrant, i.e. where θ varies from
270◦to 360◦, only values of cosine (C) are positive.
These positive signs, A, S, T and C are shown in

and the cosine rule states: a2 = b2 + c2 −2bccosA

i.e.
c = asinC
sinA = 3 × sin40◦

Problem 9.
In Figure 2.6, if b = 8.2cm.
c = 5.1cm and A = 70◦, determine the length a and
angles B and C.
From the cosine rule,
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bccosA
= 8.22 + 5.12 −2 × 8.2 × 5.1 × cos70◦
= 67.24+ 26.01 −2(8.2)(5.1)cos70◦

a
sinA =

i.e.
8.04
sin70◦= 8.2

from which,
8.04sinB = 8.2sin70◦
and

8.04
= 0.95839
and
B = sin−1(0.95839) = 73.41◦

2.4 Logarithms and exponentials
In general, if a number y can be written in the form a x,
then the index x is called the ‘logarithm of y to the base
of a’,
i.e.
if y = axthen x = logay
For example, the two statements: 16 = 24 and
log216 = 4 are equivalent.
Logarithms having a base of 10 are called common
logarithms and log10 is usually abbreviated to lg.
Logarithms having a base of e (where ‘e’ is a math-
ematical constant approximately equal to 2.7183) are
called hyperbolic, Napierian or natural logarithms,
and loge is usually abbreviated to ln.

by the third law of logarithms
Rearranging gives:
x = log10 5
log10 2 = 0.6989700...

Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:

Hence,
log10 x = log10 34.68

Thus, x=antilog 0.57040 = 100.57040 = 3.719,

2.5 Straight line graphs
A graph is a visual representation of information,
showing how one quantity varies with another related
quantity.
The most common method of showing a relationship
between two sets of data is to use a pair of reference
axes – these are two lines drawn at right angles to each
other, (often called Cartesian or rectangular axes), as
shown in Figure 2.10.

Figure 2.10
Thehorizontalaxisislabelledthex-axis,andthevertical
axis is labelled the y-axis.
The point where x is 0 and y is 0 is called the origin.
x values have scales that are positive to the right of the
origin and negative to the left.
y values have scales that are positive up from the origin
and negative down from the origin.
Co-ordinates are written with brackets and a comma in
between two numbers. For example, point A is shown
with co-ordinates (3, 2) and is located by starting at the
origin and moving 3 units in the positive x direction (i.e.
to the right) and then 2 units in the positive y direction
(i.e. up).
When co-ordinates are stated, the ﬁrst number is always
the x value, and the second number is always the y value.
Also in Figure 2.10, point B has co-ordinates (−4, 3)
and point C has co-ordinates (−3, −2)

Plot L horizontally and F vertically.
2.
Scales are normally chosen such that the graph
occupies as much space as possible on the graph
paper. So in this case, the following scales are
chosen:
Horizontal axis (i.e. L): 1 cm=50 N
Vertical axis (i.e. F): 1 cm=10 N
3.
Draw the axes and label them L (Newtons) for the
horizontal axis and F (newtons) for the vertical
axis.
4.
Label the origin as 0.
5.
Write on the horizontal scaling 100, 200, 300, and
so on, every 2 cm.

(120, 35), (230, 50), (410, 93), (540, 125) and
(680, 147) marking each with a cross or a dot.
8.
Using a ruler, draw the best straight line through
the points. You will notice that not all of the points
lie exactly on a straight line. This is quite normal
with experimentalvalues. In a practical situation it
would be surprising if all of the points lay exactly
on a straight line.
9.
Extend the straight line at each end.
10.
From the graph, determine the force applied when
the load is 325 N. It should be close to 75 N. This

Part 1

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
process of ﬁnding an equivalent value within the
given data is called interpolation.
Similarly, determine the load that a force of 45 N
will overcome. It should be close to 170 N.
11.
From the graph, determine the force needed to
overcome a 750 N load. It should be close to
161 N. This process of ﬁnding an equivalent value
outside the given data is called extrapolation. To
extrapolate we need to have extended the straight
line drawn. Similarly, determine the force applied
when the load is zero. It should be close to 11 N.
Where the straight line crosses the vertical axis is
called the vertical-axis intercept. So in this case,
the vertical-axis intercept=11 N at co-ordinates
(0, 11)

When x = 2, y = 3 × 2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8, and so on.
The co-ordinates (0, 2), (1, 5) and (2, 8) have been

2.6 Gradients, intercepts and
equation of a graph
Gradient
The gradient or slope of a straight line is the ratio of
the change in the value of y to the change in the value of
x between any two points on the line. If, as x increases,
(→), y also increases, (↑), then the gradient is positive.
In Figure 2.13(a), a straight line graph y = 2x + 1 is
shown. To ﬁnd the gradient of this straight line, choose
two points on the straight line graph, such as A and C.

In Figure 2.13(b), a straight line graph y = −3x + 2 is
shown. To ﬁnd the gradient of this straight line, choose
two points on the straight line graph, such as D and
F. Then construct a right angled triangle, such as DEF,
where EF is vertical and ED is horizontal.
Then,
gradient of DF = change in y
change in x = FE
ED
= 11 −2
−3 −0 = 9
−3 = −3
Figure 2.13(c) shows a straight line graph y = 3. Since
the straight line is horizontal the gradient is zero.
y-axis intercept
The value of y when x = 0 is called the y-axis inter-
cept. In Figure 2.5(a) the y-axis intercept is 1 and in
Figure 2.13(b) the y-axis intercept is 2
Equation of a straight line graph
The general equation of a straight line graph is:
y = mx + c
where m is the gradient or slope, and c is the y-axis
intercept
Thus, as we have found in Figure 2.13(a), y = 2x + 1
represents a straight line of gradient 2 and y-axis inter-
cept 1. So, given an equation y = 2x + 1, we are able
to state, on sight, that the gradient=2 and the y-axis
intercept=1, without the need for any analysis.
Similarly, in Figure 2.13(b), y = −3x + 2 represents a
straight line of gradient −3 and y-axis intercept 2.
In Figure 2.13(c),y = 3 may be re-writtenas y = 0x + 3
and therefore represents a straight line of gradient 0 and
y-axis intercept 3.
Here are some worked problems to help understanding
of gradients, intercepts and equation of a graph.

A piece of elastic is tied to a support so that it
hangs vertically, and a pan, on which weights
can be placed, is attached to the free end. The
length of the elastic is measured as various
weights are added to the pan and the results
obtained are as follows:

Plot a graph of load (horizontally) against
length (vertically) and determine: (a) the
length when the load is 17 N, (b) the value of
load when the length is 74 cm, (c) its gradient,
and (d) the equation of the graph.
2.7 Practical straight line graphs
When a set of co-ordinate values are given or are
obtained experimentally and it is believed that they
follow a law of the form y = mx + c, then if a straight
line can be drawn reasonably close to most of the co-
ordinate values when plotted, this veriﬁes that a law
of the form y = mx + c exists. From the graph, con-
stants m (i.e. gradient) and c (i.e. y-axis intercept) can
be determined.
Here is a worked practical problems.

R axis intercept value, (c) the equation of the graph,
(d) the value of resistance when the voltage is 60 V,
and (e) the value of the voltage when the resistance
is 40 ohms. (f) If the graph were to continue in the
same manner, what value of resistance would be
obtained at 110 V?
The co-ordinates (16, 30), (29, 48.5), and so on, are

(b)
The R-axis intercept is at R=10 ohms (by extrap-
olation)
(c)
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, when
y is plotted on the vertical axis and x on the hor-
izontal axis. m represents the gradient and c the
y-axis intercept. In this case, R corresponds to y, V
corresponds to x, m = 1.25 and c = 10. Hence the
equation of the graph is:
R = (1.25V + 10)

Chapter 3
Units associated with basic
electrical quantities
Why it is important to understand: Units associated with basic electrical quantities
The relationship between quantities can be written using words or symbols (letters), but symbols are
normally used because they are much shorter; for example, V is used for voltage, I for current and R for
resistance. Some of the units have a convenientsize for electronics, but mostare eithertoo largeor toosmall
to be used directly so they are used with preﬁxes. The preﬁxes make the unit larger or smaller by the value
shown; for example, 25 mA is read as 25 milliamperes and means 25 × 10−3A = 25 × 0.001A = 0.025A.
Knowledge of this chapter is essential for future studies and provides the basis of electrical units and
preﬁxes; some simple calculations help understanding.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
state the basic SI units
•
recognize derived SI units
•
understand preﬁxes denoting multiplication and division
•
state the units of charge, force, work and power and perform simple calculations involving these units
•
state the units of electrical potential, e.m.f., resistance, conductance, power and energy and perform simple
calculations involving these units
3.1 SI units
The system of units used in engineering and science is
the Système Internationale d’Unités (international sys-
tem of units), usually abbreviated to SI units, and is
based on the metric system. This was introduced in 1960
and is now adopted by the majority of countries as the
ofﬁcial system of measurement.
The basic units in the SI system are listed with their
symbols in Table 3.1.
Derived SI units use combinations of basic units and
there are many of them. Two examples are:
•
Velocity – metres per second (m/s)
•
Acceleration – metres per second squared (m/s2)
SI units may be made larger or smaller by using preﬁxes
which denote multiplication or division by a particu-
lar amount. The six most common multiples, with their
meaning, are listed in Table 3.2. For a more complete
list of preﬁxes, see page 813.

3.2 Charge
The unit of charge is the coulomb∗(C), where
one coulomb is one ampere second (1coulomb =
6.24×1018 electrons). The coulomb is deﬁned as the
quantity of electricity which ﬂows past a given point
∗Who was Coulomb? Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (14
June 1736–23 August 1806) was best known for devel-
oping Coulomb’s law, the deﬁnition of the electrostatic
force of attraction and repulsion. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird
in an electric circuit when a current of one ampere∗is
maintained for one second. Thus,
charge, in coulombs
Q=It
where I is the current in amperes and t is the time in
seconds.
Problem 1.
If a current of 5A ﬂows for 2
minutes, ﬁnd the quantity of electricity transferred.
Quantity of electricity Q=It coulombs
I =5A, t =2×60=120s
Hence
Q=5×120=600 C
3.3 Force
The unit of force is the newton∗(N) where one newton
is one kilogram metre per second squared. The newton
is deﬁned as the force which, when applied to a mass of
one kilogram, gives it an acceleration of one metre per
second squared. Thus,
force, in newtons
F=ma
where m is the mass in kilograms and a is the accelera-
tion in metres per second squared. Gravitational force,
or weight, is mg, where g =9.81m/s2.

An introduction to
electric circuits
Why it is important to understand: An introduction to electric circuits
Electric circuits are a part of the basic fabric of modern technology. A circuit consists of electrical elements
connected together, and we can use symbols to draw circuits. Engineers use electrical circuits to solve
problems that are important in modern society, such as in the generation, transmission and consumption
of electrical power and energy. The outstanding characteristics of electricity compared with other power
sources are its mobility and ﬂexibility. The elements in an electric circuit include sources of energy,
resistors, capacitors, inductors, and so on. Analysis of electric circuits means determining the unknown
quantities such as voltage, current and power associated with one or more elements in the circuit. Basic
electric circuit analysis and laws are explained in this chapter and knowledge of these are essential in the

4.2 Electric current and quantity
of electricity
All atoms consist of protons, neutrons and electrons.
The protons, which have positive electrical charges,
and the neutrons, which have no electrical charge,
are contained within the nucleus. Removed from the
nucleus are minute negatively charged particles called
electrons. Atoms of different materials differ from one
another by having different numbers of protons, neu-
trons and electrons. An equal number of protons and
electrons exist within an atom and it is said to be elec-
trically balanced, as the positive and negative charges
cancel each other out. When there are more than two
electrons in an atom the electrons are arranged into
shells at various distances from the nucleus.
All atoms are bound together by powerful forces of
attraction existing between the nucleus and its elec-
trons. Electrons in the outer shell of an atom, however,
are attracted to their nucleus less powerfully than are
electrons whose shells are nearer the nucleus.
It is possible for an atom to lose an electron; the atom,
which is now called an ion, is not now electrically bal-
anced,but is positivelychargedand is thus able to attract
an electron to itself from another atom. Electrons that
move from one atom to another are called free elec-
trons and such randommotion can continue indeﬁnitely.
However, if an electric pressure or voltage is applied
across any material there is a tendency for electrons to
move in a particular direction. This movement of free
electrons, known as drift, constitutes an electric current
ﬂow. Thus current is the rate of movement of charge.
Conductors are materials that contain electrons that are
loosely connected to the nucleus and can easily move
through the material from one atom to another.
Insulators are materials whose electronsare held ﬁrmly
to their nucleus.
The unit used to measure the quantity of elec-
trical charge Q is called the coulomb∗(where 1
coulomb=6.24×1018 electrons).
If the drift of electrons in a conductor takes place at the
rate of one coulomb per second the resulting current is
said to be a current of one ampere.∗

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Thus, 1 ampere=1 coulomb per second or 1 A=1 C/s.
Hence, 1 coulomb=1 ampere second or 1C=1As.
Generally, if I is the current in amperes and t the
time in seconds during which the current ﬂows, then
I ×t represents the quantity of electrical charge in
coulombs, i.e.
quantity of electrical charge transferred,
Q = I × t coulombs

minutes, ﬁnd the quantity of electricity transferred.
Quantity of electricity, Q=It coulombs
I =10 A; t =4×60=240s

4.3 Potential difference and
resistance
For a continuous current to ﬂow between two points in
a circuit a potential difference (p.d.) or voltage, V, is
required between them; a complete conducting path is
necessary to and from the source of electrical energy.
The unit of p.d. is the volt, V (named in honour of the
Italian physicist Alessandro VoltaVolta∗).

Figure 4.2 shows a cell connected across a ﬁlament
lamp.Currentﬂow,byconvention,isconsideredasﬂow-
ing from the positive terminal of the cell, around the
circuit to the negative terminal.
The ﬂow of electric current is subject to friction. This
friction, or opposition, is called resistance, R, and is the
property of a conductor that limits current. The unit of
resistance is the ohm; 1 ohm is deﬁned as the resistance
which will have a current of 1 ampere ﬂowing through
it when 1 volt is connected across it, i.e.
resistance R = potential difference
current
4.4 Basic electrical measuring
instruments
An ammeter is an instrument used to measure cur-
rent and must be connected in series with the circuit.
Figure 4.2 shows an ammeter connected in series with
the lamp to measure the current ﬂowing throughit. Since
all the current in the circuit passes through the ammeter
it must have a very low resistance.
A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure p.d. and
must be connected in parallel with the part of the cir-
cuit whose p.d. is required. In Figure 4.2, a voltmeter is
connected in parallel with the lamp to measure the p.d.
across it. To avoid a signiﬁcant current ﬂowing through
it a voltmeter must have a very high resistance.
An
ohmmeter
is
an
instrument
for
measuring
resistance.
A multimeter, or universal instrument, may be used to
measure voltage, current and resistance. An ‘Avometer’
and ‘ﬂuke’ are typical examples.
The oscilloscope may be used to observe waveforms
and to measure voltages and currents. The display of
an oscilloscope involves a spot of light moving across
a screen. The amount by which the spot is deﬂected
from its initial position depends on the p.d. applied to
the terminals of the oscilloscope and the range selected.

Part 2
An introduction to electric circuits
59
The displacement is calibrated in ‘volts per cm’. For
example, if the spot is deﬂected 3cm and the volts/cm
switch is on 10V/cm then the magnitude of the p.d. is
3cm×10V/cm, i.e. 30V.
A wattmeter is an instrument for the measurement of
power in an electrical circuit.
A BM80 or a 420 MIT megger or a bridge megger
may be used to measure both continuity and insula-
tion resistance. Continuity testing is the measurement
of the resistance of a cable to discover if the cable is
continuous, i.e. that it has no breaks or high-resistance
joints.Insulationresistancetesting isthemeasurement
of resistance of the insulation between cables, individ-
ual cables to earth or metal plugs and sockets, and so on.
An insulation resistance in excess of 1M is normally
acceptable.
A tachometer is an instrument that indicates the speed,
usually in revolutions per minute, at which an engine
shaft is rotating.
A stroboscope is a device for viewing a rotating object
at regularly recurring intervals, by means of either (a) a
rotating or vibrating shutter, or (b) a suitably designed
lamp which ﬂashes periodically. If the period between
successive views is exactly the same as the time of one
revolutionoftherevolvingobject,andthedurationofthe
view very short, the object will appear to be stationary.
See Chapter 12 for more detail about electrical measur-
ing instruments and measurements.
4.5 Linear and non-linear devices
Figure 4.3 shows a circuit in which current I can be
varied by the variable resistor R2. For various settings
of R2, the current ﬂowing in resistor R1, displayed
on the ammeter, and the p.d. across R1, displayed on
the voltmeter, are noted and a graph is plotted of p.d.
against current. The result is shown in Figure 4.4(a),
where the straight line graph passing through the origin
indicates that current is directly proportional to the
p.d. Since the gradient i.e. (p.d./current) is constant,
V

resistance R1 is constant. A resistor is thus an example
of a linear device.

If the resistor R1 in Figure 4.3 is replaced by a
component such as a lamp, then the graph shown in
Figure 4.4(b) results when values of p.d. are noted for
various current readings. Since the gradient is changing,
the lamp is an example of a non-linear device.
4.6 Ohm’s law
Ohm’s law∗states that the current I ﬂowing in a circuit
is directly proportional to the applied voltage V and
inversely proportional to the resistance R, provided the
temperature remains constant. Thus,
I = V
R
or V = IR or R = V
I

4.7 Multiples and sub-multiples
Currents, voltages and resistances can often be very
large or very small. Thus multiples and sub-multiples
of units are often used, as stated in Chapter 3. The most
common ones, with an example of each, are listed in
Table 4.1.

4.8 Conductors and insulators
A conductor is a material having a low resistance which
allows electric current to ﬂow in it. All metals are con-
ductors and some examples include copper, aluminium,
brass, platinum, silver, gold and carbon.
An insulator is a material having a high resistance
which does not allow electric current to ﬂow in it.
Some examples of insulators include plastic, rubber,
glass, porcelain, air, paper, cork, mica, ceramics and
certain oils.
4.9 Electrical power and energy
Electrical power
Power P in an electrical circuit is given by the prod-
uct of potential difference V and current I, as stated in
Chapter 1. The unit of power is the watt∗, W. Hence
P = V ×I watts
(4.1)
From Ohm’s law, V =IR
Substituting for V in equation (4.1) gives:
P = (IR) × I
i.e.
P = I2R watts
Also, from Ohm’s law, I = V
R
Substituting for I in equation (4.1) gives:
P = V × V
R
i.e.
P = V2
R
watts
There are thus three possible formulae which may be
used for calculating power.

Electrical energy
Electrical energy = power×time
If the power is measured in watts and the time in seconds
then the unit of energy is watt-seconds or joules∗. If the
power is measured in kilowatts and the time in hours
then the unit of energy is kilowatt-hours, often called
the ‘unit of electricity’. The ‘electricity meter’ in the
home records the number of kilowatt-hours used and is
thus an energy meter.

power P = V × I = 200 × 10 = 2000 W=2kW)
Energy used in 6 hours

1 unit of electricity=1kWh
Hence the number of units used is 12
Cost of energy=12×13 p=£1.56

A business uses two 3kW ﬁres for
an average of 20 hours each per week, and six
150W lights for 30 hours each per week. If the cost
of electricity is 14.25p per unit, determine the
weekly cost of electricity to the business.
Energy=power×time
Energy used by one 3kW ﬁre in 20 hours

Hence weekly energy used by two 3kW ﬁres
=2×60=120kWh
Energy used by one 150W light for 30 hours

Total energy used per week=120+27=147kWh

Some practical applications of the effects of an electric
current include:
Magnetic effect:
bells, relays, motors, generators,

Chemical effect: primary and secondary cells and
electroplating (see Chapter 6)
Heating effect:
cookers, water heaters, electric ﬁres,
irons, furnaces, kettles and
soldering irons
4.11 Fuses
If there is a fault in a piece of equipment then excessive
currentmay ﬂow. This will cause overheatingand possi-
bly a ﬁre; fuses protect against this happening. Current
fromthe supplyto the equipmentﬂows throughthe fuse.
The fuse is a piece of wire which can carry a stated cur-
rent; if the current rises above this value it will melt. If
the fuse melts (blows) then there is an open circuit and
no currentcan then ﬂow – thus protecting the equipment
by isolating it from the power supply.
The fuse must be able to carry slightly more than the
normal operating current of the equipment to allow for
tolerances and small current surges. With some equip-
ment there is a very large surge ofcurrent fora short time
at switch on. If a fuse is ﬁtted to withstand this large cur-
rent there would be no protection against faults which
cause the current to rise slightly above the normal value.
Therefore special anti-surge fuses are ﬁtted. These can
stand 10 times the rated current for 10 milliseconds. If
the surge lasts longer than this the fuse will blow.
A circuit diagram symbol for a fuse is shown in
Figure 4.1 on page 57.

4.12 Insulation and the dangers
of constant high current ﬂow
The use of insulation materials on electrical equipment,
whilst being necessary, also has the effect of prevent-
ing heat loss, i.e. the heat is not able to dissipate, thus
creating possible danger of ﬁre. In addition, the insulat-
ing material has a maximum temperature rating – this is
heat it can withstand without being damaged. The cur-
rent rating for all equipment and electrical components
is therefore limited to keep the heat generated within
safe limits. In addition, the maximum voltage present
needs to be considered when choosing insulation.

Chapter 5
Resistance variation
Why it is important to understand: Resistance variation
An electron travelling through the wires and loads of an electric circuit encounters resistance. Resistance
is the hindrance to the ﬂow of charge. The ﬂow of charge through wires is often compared to the ﬂow of
water through pipes. The resistance to the ﬂow of charge in an electric circuit is analogous to the frictional
effects between water and the pipe surfaces as well as the resistance offered by obstacles that are present
in its path. It is this resistance that hinders the water ﬂow and reduces both its ﬂow rate and its drift speed.
Like the resistance to water ﬂow, the total amount of resistance to charge ﬂow within a wire of an electric
circuit is affected by some clearly identiﬁable variables. Factors which affect resistance are length, cross-
sectional area and type of material. The value of a resistor also changes with changing temperature, but
this is not as we might expect, mainly due to a change in the dimensions of the component as it expands
or contracts. It is due mainly to a change in the resistivity of the material caused by the changing activity
of the atoms that make up the resistor. Resistance variation due to length, cross-sectional area, type of
material and temperature variation are explained in this chapter, with calculations to aid understanding.
In addition, the resistor colour coding/ohmic values are explained.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
recognize three common methods of resistor construction
•
appreciate that electrical resistance depends on four factors
•
appreciate that resistance R = ρl
a , where ρ is the resistivity
•

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
5.1 Resistor construction
There is a wide range of resistor types. Four of the most
common methods of construction are:
(i) Surface Mount Technology (SMT)
Many modern circuits use SMT resistors. Their manu-
facture involves depositing a ﬁlm of resistive material
such as tin oxide on a tiny ceramic chip.The edges of the
resistor are then accurately ground or cut with a laser to
give a precise resistance across the ends of the device.
Tolerances may be as low as ±0.02% and SMT resistors
normally have very low power dissipation. Their main
advantage is that very high component density can be
achieved.
(ii) Wire wound resistors
A length of wire such, as nichrome or manganin, whose
resistive value per unit length is known, is cut to the
desired value and wound around a ceramic former prior
to being lacquered for protection. This type of resistor
has a large physical size, which is a disadvantage; how-
ever, they can be made with a high degree of accuracy,
and can have a high power rating.
Wire wound resistors are used in power circuits and
motor starters.
(iii) Metal ﬁlm resistors
Metal ﬁlm resistors are made from small rods of
ceramic coated with metal, such as a nickel alloy. The
value of resistance is controlled ﬁrstly by the thickness
of the coating layer (the thicker the layer, the lower
the value of resistance), and secondly by cutting a ﬁne
spiral groove along the rod using a laser or diamond
cutter to cut the metal coating into a long spiral strip,
which forms the resistor.
Metal ﬁlm resistors are low tolerance, precise resis-
tors (±1% or less) and are used in electronic circuits.
Figure 5.1
(iv) Carbon ﬁlm resistors
Carbon ﬁlm resistors have a similar construction to
metal ﬁlm resistors but generally with wider tolerance,
typically ±5%. They are inexpensive, in common use,
and are used in electronic circuits.
Some typical resistors are shown in Figure 5.1.
5.2 Resistance and resistivity
The resistance of an electrical conductor depends on
four factors, these being: (a) the length of the conductor,
(b) the cross-sectional area of the conductor,(c) the type
of material and (d) the temperature of the material.
Resistance, R, is directly proportional to length, l, of
a conductor, i.e. R ∝l. Thus, for example, if the lengthof
a piece of wire is doubled, then the resistance is doubled.
Resistance, R, is inversely proportional to cross-
sectional area, a, of a conductor, i.e. R ∝1/a. Thus, for
example, if the cross-sectional area of a piece of wire is
doubled then the resistance is halved.
Since R ∝l and R ∝1/a then R ∝l/a. By inserting a
constant of proportionality into this relationshipthe type
of material used may be taken into account. The con-
stant of proportionalityis known as the resistivity of the
material and is given the symbol ρ (Greek rho). Thus,
resistance
R = ρl
a ohms
ρ is measured in ohm metres (m)
The value of the resistivity is that resistance of a unit
cube of the material measured between opposite faces
of the cube.
Resistivity varies with temperature and some typical
values of resistivities measured at about room tempera-
ture are given below:
Copper
1.7×10−8m (or 0.017μm)
Aluminium
2.6×10−8m (or 0.026μm)
Carbon (graphite) 10×10−8m
(or 0.10μm)

Mica
1×1013 m
Note that good conductors of electricityhave alowvalue
of resistivity and good insulators have a high value of
resistivity.

5.3 Temperature coefﬁcient
of resistance
In general, as the temperature of a material increases,
most conductors increase in resistance, insulators
decrease in resistance, whilst the resistances of some
special alloys remain almost constant.
The temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of a
material is the increase in the resistance of a 1
resistor of that material when it is subjected to a rise of
temperature of 1◦C. The symbol used for the tempera-
ture coefﬁcient of resistance is α (Greek alpha). Thus, if
some copper wire of resistance 1 is heated through
1◦C and its resistance is then measured as 1.0043
then α =0.0043/◦C for copper. The units are usu-
ally expressed only as ‘per ◦C’, i.e. α =0.0043/◦C
for copper. If the 1 resistor of copper is heated
through 100◦C then the resistance at 100◦C would be
1+100×0.0043=1.43.
Some typical values of temperature coefﬁcient of resis-
tance measured at 0◦C are given below:
Copper
0.0043/◦C Aluminium
0.0038/◦C
Nickel
0.0062/◦C Carbon
−0.00048/◦C
Constantan
0
Eureka
0.00001/◦C
(Note that the negative sign for carbon indicates that its
resistance falls with increase of temperature.)
If the resistance of a material at 0◦C is known, the
resistance at any other temperature can be determined
from:
Rθ = R0(1 + α0θ)
where R0 = resistance at 0◦C
Rθ = resistance at temperature θ ◦C

A coil of copper wire has a resistance
of 100 when its temperature is 0◦C. Determine its
resistance at 70◦C if the temperature coefﬁcient of
resistance of copper at 0◦C is 0.0043/◦C.
Resistance Rθ =R0(1+α0θ)
Hence resistance at 70◦C, R70 = 100[1+(0.0043)(70)]
= 100[1 + 0.301]
= 100(1.301)
= 130.1
Problem 9.
An aluminium cable has a resistance
of 27 at a temperature of 35◦C. Determine its
resistance at 0◦C. Take the temperature coefﬁcient
of resistance at 0◦C to be 0.0038/◦C.

A carbon resistor has a resistance of
1k at 0◦C. Determine its resistance at 80◦C.
Assume that the temperature coefﬁcient of
resistance for carbon at 0◦C is −0.0005/◦C.
Resistance at temperature θ ◦C, Rθ =R0(1+α0θ)
i.e. Rθ = 1000[1 + (−0.0005)(80)]
= 1000[1 −0.040] = 1000(0.96)
= 960
If the resistance of a material at room temperature
(approximately 20◦C), R20, and the temperature coef-
ﬁcient of resistance at 20◦C, α20, are known, then the
resistance Rθ at temperature θ ◦C is given by:
Rθ = R20[1 + α20(θ −20)]
Problem 11.
A coil of copper wire has a
resistance of 10 at 20◦C. If the temperature
coefﬁcient of resistance of copper at 20◦C is
0.004/◦C, determine the resistance of the coil when
the temperature rises to 100◦C.
Resistance at θ◦C, R =R20[1+α20(θ −20)]
Hence resistance at 100◦C,
R100 =10[1+(0.004)(100−20)]
=10[1+(0.004)(80)]
=10[1+0.32]

Problem 12.
The resistance of a coil of
aluminium wire at 18◦C is 200. The temperature
of the wire is increased and the resistance rises to
240. If the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of
aluminium is 0.0039/◦C at 18◦C, determine the
temperature to which the coil has risen.
Let the temperature rise to θ ◦
Resistance at θ◦C, Rθ =R18[1+α18(θ −18)]
i.e.
240=200[1+(0.0039)(θ −18)]
240=200+(200)(0.0039)(θ −18)
240−200=0.78(θ −18)
40=0.78(θ −18)
40
0.78 =θ −18
51.28=θ −18, from which,
θ =51.28+18=69.28◦C
Hence the temperature of the coil increases to
69.28◦C
If the resistance at 0◦C is not known, but is known at
some other temperature θ1, then the resistance at any
temperature can be found as follows:
R1 = R0(1 + α0θ1) and R2 = R0(1 + α0θ2)
Dividing one equation by the other gives:
R1
R2
= 1 + α0θ1

For a four-band ﬁxed resistor (i.e. resistance
values with two signiﬁcant ﬁgures):
yellow-violet-orange-red indicates 47k with a
tolerance of ±2%
(Note that the ﬁrst band is the one nearest the end
of the resistor.)
(ii)
For a ﬁve-band ﬁxed resistor (i.e. resistance
values with three signiﬁcant ﬁgures): red-yellow-
white-orange-brownindicates 249k with a toler-

(Note that the ﬁfth band is 1.5 to 2 times wider than
the other bands.)

Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of:
orange-orange-silver-brown.
The ﬁrst two bands, i.e. orange-orange, give 33 from
Table 5.1.
The third band, silver, indicates a multiplier of 102 from
Table 5.1, which means that the value of the resistor is
33×10−2 =0.33
The fourth band, i.e. brown, indicates a tolerance
of ±1% from Table 5.1. Hence a colour coding of
orange-orange-silver-brown represents a resistor of
value 0.33 with a tolerance of ±1%
Problem 15.
Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of
brown-black-brown.
The ﬁrst two bands, i.e. brown-black, give 10 from

The third band, brown, indicates a multiplier of 10 from
Table 5.1, which means that the value of the resistor is
10×10=100
There is no fourth band colour in this case; hence,
from Table 5.1, the tolerance is ±20%. Hence a colour
coding of brown-black-brown represents a resistor of
value 100 with a tolerance of ±20%
Problem 16.

resistor with colour coding brown-black-brown-
silver lie?
From Table 5.1, brown-black-brown-silver indicates
10×10, i.e. 100, with a tolerance of ±10%
This means that the value could lie between
(100−10% of 100)
and
(100+ 10% of 100)
i.e. brown-black-brown-silver indicates any value
between 90 and 110
Problem 17.
Determine the colour coding for a
47k resistor having a tolerance of ±5%
From Table 5.1, 47k=47×103 has a colour coding
of yellow-violet-orange. With a tolerance of ±5%, the
fourth band will be gold.
Hence 47k±5% has a colour coding of:
yellow-violet-orange-gold.
Problem 18.
Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of orange-
green-red-yellow-brown.
Orange-green-red-yellow-brown is a ﬁve-band ﬁxed
resistor and from Table 5.1 indicates: 352×104  with
a tolerance of ±1%
352× 104  = 3.52 × 106,i.e. 3.52M
Hence
orange-green-red-yellow-brown
indicates

Chapter 6
Batteries and alternative
sources of energy
Why it is important to understand: Batteries and alternative sources of energy
Batteries store electricity in a chemical form, inside a closed-energy system. They can be re-charged
and re-used as a power source in small appliances, machinery and remote locations. Batteries can store
d.c. electrical energy produced by renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro power in chemical
form. Because renewable energy-chargingsources are often intermittent in their nature, batteries provide
energy storage in order to provide a relatively constant supply of power to electrical loads regardless of
whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. In an off-grid photovoltaic (PV) system, for example,
batterystorageprovides a wayto power common household appliances regardless of the time of day or the
current weather conditions. In a grid-tie with battery backup PV system, batteries provide uninterrupted
power in case of utility power failure. Energy causes movement; every time something moves, energy is
being used. Energy moves cars, makes machines run, heats ovens, and lights our homes. One form of
energy can be changed into another form. When petrol is burned in a vehicle engine, the energy stored
in petrol is changed into heat energy. When we stand in the sun, light energy is changed into heat. When
a torch or ﬂashlight is turned on, chemical energy stored in the battery is changed into light and heat. To
ﬁnd energy, look for motion, heat, light, sound, chemical reactions or electricity. The sun is the source of
all energy. The sun’s energy is stored in coal, petroleum, natural gas, food, water and wind. While there
are two types of energy, renewable and non-renewable, most of the energy we use comes from burning
non-renewable fuels – coal, petroleum or oil or natural gas. These supply the majority of our energy
needs because we have designed ways to transform their energy on a large scale to meet consumer needs.
Regardless of the energy source, the energy contained in them is changed into a more useful form of
electricity. This chapter explains the increasingly important area of battery use and brieﬂy looks at some
alternative sources of energy.

6.1 Introduction to batteries
A battery is a device that converts chemical energy
to electricity. If an appliance is placed between its
terminals the current generated will power the device.
Batteries are an indispensable item for many electronic
devices and are essential for devices that require power
when no mains power is available. For example, without
the battery there would be no mobile phones or laptop
computers.
The battery is now over 200 years old and batteries are
found almost everywhere in consumer and industrial
products. Some practical examples where batteries are
used include:
in laptops, in cameras, in mobile phones, in
cars, in watches and clocks, for security equip-
ment, in electronic meters, for smoke alarms, for
meters used to read gas, water and electricity
consumption at home, to power a camera for an
endoscope looking internally at the body, and for
transponders used for toll collection on highways
throughout the world.
Batteries tend to be split into two categories – primary,
which are not designed to be electrically re-charged,
i.e. are disposable (see Section 6.6), and secondary
batteries, which are designed to be re-charged, such
as those used in mobile phones (see Section 6.7).
In more recent years it has been necessary to design
batteries with reduced size, but with increased lifespan
and capacity.
If an applicationrequires small size and high powerthen
the 1.5V battery is used. If longer lifetime is required
then the 3 to 3.6V battery is used. In the 1970s the
1.5V manganese battery was gradually replaced by
the alkaline battery. Silver oxide batteries were grad-
ually introduced in the 1960s and are still the preferred
technology for watch batteries today.
Lithium-ion batteries were introduced in the 1970s
because of the need for longer lifetime applications.
Indeed,somesuchbatterieshavebeenknowntolastwell
over ten years before replacement, a characteristic that
means that these batteries are still very much in demand
today for digital cameras, and sometimes for watches
and computer clocks. Lithium batteries are capable of
delivering high currents but tend to be expensive. For
more on lithium-ion batteries see Section 6.8, page 81.
More types of batteries and their uses are listed in
Table 6.2 on page 82.
6.2 Some chemical effects
of electricity
A material must contain charged particles to be able to
conduct electric current. In solids, the current is carried
by electrons. Copper, lead, aluminium, iron and carbon
are some examples of solid conductors. In liquids and
gases, the current is carried by the part of a molecule
which has acquired an electric charge, called ions.
These can possess a positive or negative charge, and
examples include hydrogen ion H+, copper ion Cu++
and hydroxyl ion OH−. Distilled water contains no
ions and is a poor conductor of electricity, whereas salt
water contains ions and is a fairly good conductor of
electricity.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid compound
by the passage of electric current through it. Practical
applications of electrolysis include the electroplating
of metals (see below), the reﬁning of copper and the
extraction of aluminium from its ore.
An electrolyte is a compound which will undergo elec-
trolysis. Examples include salt water, copper sulphate
and sulphuric acid.
The electrodes are the two conductors carrying current
to the electrolyte. The positive-connected electrode is

Part 2
Batteries and alternative sources of energy
75
called the anode and the negative-connected electrode
the cathode.
Whentwocopperwiresconnectedtoabatteryareplaced
in a beaker containing a salt water solution, current will
ﬂow through the solution. Air bubbles appear around the
wires as the water is changed into hydrogenand oxygen
by electrolysis.
Electroplating uses the principle of electrolysis to
apply a thin coat of one metal to another metal. Some
practical applications include the tin-plating of steel,
silver-plating of nickel alloys and chromium-plating of
steel. If two copper electrodes connected to a battery
are placed in a beaker containing copper sulphate as the
electrolyte it is found that the cathode (i.e. the electrode
connected to the negative terminal of the battery) gains
copper whilst the anode loses copper.
6.3 The simple cell
The purpose of an electric cell is to convert chemical
energy into electrical energy.
A simple cell comprises two dissimilar conductors
(electrodes) in an electrolyte. Such a cell is shown in
Figure 6.1, comprising copper and zinc electrodes. An
electric current is found to ﬂow between the electrodes.
Other possible electrode pairs exist, including zinc–
lead and zinc–iron. The electrode potential (i.e. the p.d.
measured between the electrodes) varies for each pair
of metals. By knowing the e.m.f. of each metal with
respect to some standard electrode, the e.m.f. of any
pair of metals may be determined. The standard used is
the hydrogen electrode. The electrochemical series is
a way of listing elements in order of electrical potential,
and Table 6.1 shows a number of elements in such a
series.

In a simple cell two faults exist – those due to
polarization and local action.
Polarization
If the simple cell shown in Figure 6.1 is left connected
for some time, the current I decreases fairly rapidly.
This is because of the formation of a ﬁlm of hydrogen
bubbles on the copper anode. This effect is known as
the polarization of the cell. The hydrogen prevents full
contact between the copperelectrode and the electrolyte
and this increases the internal resistance of the cell. The
effect can be overcome by using a chemical depolariz-
ing agent or depolarizer, such as potassium dichromate,
which removes the hydrogen bubbles as they form. This
allows the cell to deliver a steady current.
Local action
Whencommercialzincisplacedindilutesulphuricacid,
hydrogen gas is liberated from it and the zinc dissolves.
The reason for this is that impurities, such as traces of
iron, are present in the zinc which set up small primary
cells with the zinc. These small cells are short-circuited
by the electrolyte, with the result that localized currents
ﬂow, causing corrosion. This action is known as local
action of the cell. This may be prevented by rubbing
a small amount of mercury on the zinc surface, which
forms a protective layer on the surface of the electrode.
When two metals are used in a simple cell the elec-
trochemical series may be used to predict the behaviour
of the cell:

Part 2
76
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(i)
The metal that is higher in the series acts as the
negative electrode, and vice-versa. For example,
the zinc electrode in the cell shown in Figure 6.1
is negative and the copper electrode is positive.
(ii)
The greater the separation in the series between
the two metals the greater is the e.m.f. produced
by the cell.
The electrochemical series is representative of the order
of reactivity of the metals and their compounds:
(i)
The higher metals in the series react more readily
with oxygen and vice-versa.
(ii)
When two metal electrodes are used in a simple
cell the one that is higher in the series tends to
dissolve in the electrolyte.
6.4 Corrosion
Corrosion is the gradual destruction of a metal in a
damp atmosphere by means of simple cell action. In
addition to the presence of moisture and air required
for rusting, an electrolyte, an anode and a cathode are
required for corrosion. Thus, if metals widely spaced in
the electrochemical series are used in contact with each
other in the presence of an electrolyte, corrosion will
occur. For example, if a brass valve is ﬁtted to a heating
system made of steel, corrosion will occur.
The effects of corrosion include the weakening of
structures, the reduction of the life of components and
materials, the wastage of materials and the expense of
replacement.
Corrosion may be prevented by coating with paint,
grease, plastic coatings and enamels, or by plating with
tin or chromium. Also, iron may be galvanized, i.e.
plated with zinc, the layer of zinc helping to prevent
the iron from corroding.
6.5 E.m.f. and internal resistance
of a cell
The electromotive force (e.m.f.), E, of a cell is the p.d.
between its terminals when it is not connected to a load
(i.e. the cell is on ‘no load’).
The e.m.f. of a cell is measured by using a high resis-
tance voltmeter connectedin parallel with the cell. The
voltmeter must have a high resistance otherwise it will
pass current and the cell will not be on ‘no-load’. For
example, if the resistance of a cell is 1 and that of
a voltmeter 1M, then the equivalent resistance of the
circuit is 1M+1, i.e. approximately 1M, hence
no current ﬂows and the cell is not loaded.
The voltage available at the terminals of a cell falls
when a load is connected. This is caused by the internal
resistance of the cell which is the opposition of the
material of the cell to the ﬂow of current. The internal
resistance acts in series with other resistances in the
circuit. Figure 6.2 shows a cell of e.m.f. E volts and
internal resistance, r, and XY represents the terminals
of the cell.
R

Y

Figure 6.2
When a load (shown as resistance R) is not connected,
no current ﬂows and the terminal p.d., V =E. When R is
connected a current I ﬂows which causes a voltage drop
in the cell, given by Ir. The p.d. available at the cell ter-
minals is less than the e.m.f. of the cell and is given by:
V = E −Ir
Thus if a battery of e.m.f. 12 volts and internal
resistance 0.01 delivers a current of 100A, the ter-
minal p.d.,
V = 12 −(100)(0.01)
= 12 −1 = 11V
When different values of potential difference V
across a cell or power supply are measured for different
values of current I, a graph may be plotted as shown
in Figure 6.3. Since the e.m.f. E of the cell or power
supply is the p.d. across its terminals on no load (i.e.
when I =0), then E is as shown by the broken line.

Since V =E −Ir then the internal resistance may be
calculated from
r = E −V
I
When a current is ﬂowing in the direction shown in
Figure 6.2 the cell is said to be discharging (E >V ).
When a current ﬂows in the opposite direction to that
shown in Figure 6.2 the cell is said to be charging
(V >E).
A battery is a combination of more than one cell.
The cells in a battery may be connected in series or
in parallel.
(i)
For cells connected in series:
Total e.m.f. = sum of cells’ e.m.f.s
Total internal resistance = sum of cells’ internal
resistances
(ii)
For cells connected in parallel:
If each cell has the same e.m.f. and internal
resistance:
Total e.m.f. = e.m.f. of one cell
Total internal resistance of n cells
= 1

Problem 2.
A cell has an internal resistance of
0.02 and an e.m.f. of 2.0V. Calculate its terminal
p.d. if it delivers (a) 5A, (b) 50A.
(a)
Terminal p.d. V =E −Ir where E = e.m.f. of
cell, I = current ﬂowing and r = internal resis-
tance of cell
E = 2.0V,I = 5A and r = 0.02
Hence terminal p.d.
V = 2.0 −(5)(0.02) = 2.0 −0.1 = 1.9V
(b)
When the current is 50A, terminal p.d.,
V = E −Ir = 2.0 −50(0.02)
i.e.
V = 2.0 −1.0 = 1.0V
Thus the terminal p.d. decreases as the current
drawn increases.
Problem 3.
The p.d. at the terminals of a battery
is 25V when no load is connected and 24V when a
load taking 10A is connected. Determine the
internal resistance of the battery.
When no load is connected the e.m.f. of the battery, E,
is equal to the terminal p.d., V , i.e. E =25V
When current I =10A and terminal p.d.
V = 24V, then V = E −Ir
i.e.
24 = 25 −(10)r
Hence, rearranging gives
10r = 25 −24 = 1
and the internal resistance,
r = 1
10 = 0.1

Ten 1.5V cells, each having an
internal resistance of 0.2, are connected in series
to a load of 58. Determine (a) the current ﬂowing
in the circuit and (b) the p.d. at the battery terminals.

For ten cells, battery e.m.f., E =10×1.5=15V,
and the total internal resistance, r=10×0.2=2.

6.6 Primary cells
Primary cells cannot be recharged, that is, the con-
version of chemical energy to electrical energy is irre-
versible and the cell cannot be used once the chemicals
are exhausted. Examples of primary cells include the
Leclanché cell and the mercury cell.

is the most commonly used of primary cells, is cheap,
requires little maintenance and has a shelf life of about
two years.

A typical mercury cell is shown in Figure 6.7. Such
a cell has an e.m.f. of about 1.3V which remains con-
stant for a relatively long time. Its main advantages over

life. Typical practical applications include hearing aids,
medical electronics, cameras and guided missiles.

Secondary cells can be recharged after use, that is, the
conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is
reversible and the cell may be used many times. Exam-
ples of secondarycells include the lead–acidcell and the
nickel cadmium and nickel–metal cells. Practical appli-
cations of such cells include car batteries, telephone
circuits and for traction purposes– such as milk delivery
vans and fork-lift trucks.

An electrolyte which is a mixture of sulphuric
acid and distilled water.
The relative density (or speciﬁc gravity) of a lead–acid
cell, which may be measured using a hydrometer,varies
between about 1.26 when the cell is fully charged to
about 1.19 when discharged. The terminal p.d. ofa lead–
acid cell is about 2V.
When a cell supplies current to a load it is said to be
discharging. During discharge:
(i)
the lead peroxide (positive plate) and the spongy
lead (negative plate) are converted into lead sul-
phate, and
(ii)
the oxygen in the lead peroxide combines with
hydrogen in the electrolyte to form water. The
electrolyte is therefore weakened and the relative
density falls.
The terminal p.d. of a lead–acid cell when fully dis-
charged is about 1.8V. A cell is charged by connecting
a d.c. supply to its terminals, the positive terminal of
the cell being connected to the positive terminal of the
supply. The charging current ﬂows in the reverse direc-
tion to the discharge current and the chemical action is
reversed. During charging:
(i)
the lead sulphate on the positive and negative
plates is converted back to lead peroxide and lead,
respectively, and
(ii)
the water content of the electrolyte decreases as
the oxygenreleased from the electrolyte combines
with the lead of the positive plate. The relative
density of the electrolyte thus increases.
The colour of the positive plate when fully charged is
dark brown and when discharged is light brown. The
colour of the negative plate when fully charged is grey
and when discharged is light grey.
To help maintain lead-acid cells, always store them
in a charged condition, never let the open cell voltage
drop much below 2.10 V, apply a topping charge every
six months or when recommended, avoid repeated deep
discharges, charge more often or use a larger battery,
prevent sulphation and grid corrosion by choosing the
correct charge and ﬂoat voltages, and avoid operating
them at elevated ambient temperatures.
Nickel cadmium and nickel–metal cells
In both types the positive plate is made of nickel
hydroxide enclosed in ﬁnely perforated steel tubes, the
resistance being reduced by the addition of pure nickel
or graphite. The tubes are assembled into nickel–steel
plates.
In the nickel–metal cell (sometimes called the
Edison∗cell or nife cell), the negative plate is made
of iron oxide, with the resistance being reduced by a
little mercuric oxide, the whole being enclosed in per-
forated steel tubes and assembled in steel plates. In the
nickel–cadmium cell the negative plate is made of cad-
mium. The electrolyte in each type of cell is a solution
of potassium hydroxide which does not undergo any
∗Who was Edison? Thomas Alva Edison (11 February 1847–
18 October 1931) was an American inventor and businessman.
Edison is the fourth most proliﬁc inventor in history, holding

elsewhere. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

chemical change and thus the quantity can be reduced
to a minimum. The plates are separated by insulating
rods and assembled in steel containers which are then
enclosedinanon-metalliccratetoinsulatethecellsfrom
one another. The average discharge p.d. of an alkaline
cell is about 1.2V.
Advantages of a nickel cadmium cell or a nickel–
metal cell over a lead–acid cell include:
(i)
more robust construction
(ii)
capable of withstanding heavy charging and dis-
charging currents without damage
(iii)
has a longer life
(iv)
for a given capacity is lighter in weight
(v)
can be left indeﬁnitely in any state of charge or
discharge without damage
(vi)
is not self-discharging.
Disadvantages of a nickel cadmium and nickel–metal
cell over a lead–acid cell include:
(i)
is relatively more expensive
(ii)
requires more cells for a given e.m.f.
(iii)
has a higher internal resistance
(iv)
must be kept sealed
(v)
has a lower efﬁciency.
Nickel cells may be used in extremes of temperature,
in conditions where vibration is experienced or where
duties require long idle periods or heavy discharge cur-
rents. Practical examples include traction and marine
work, lighting in railway carriages, military portable
radios and for starting diesel and petrol engines.

6.8 Lithium-ion batteries
Lithium-ion batteries are incredibly popular and may
be found in laptops, hand-held pcs, mobile phones and
iPods.
A lithium-ion battery (sometimes Li-ion battery
or LIB) is a member of a family of rechargeable bat-
tery types in which lithium ions move from the negative
electrode to the positive electrode during discharge and
back when charging. Li-ion batteries use an intercalated
lithium compound as one electrode material, compared
to the metallic lithium used in a non-rechargeable
lithium battery. The electrolyte, which allows for ionic
movement, and the two electrodes are the constituent
components of a lithium-ion battery cell.
Lithium-ion batteries are common in consumer elec-
tronics. They are one of the most popular types of
rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, with a
high energy density, small memory effect and only a
slow loss of charge when not in use. Beyond con-
sumer electronics, LIBs are also growing in popularity
for military, battery electric vehicle and aerospace
applications. Also, lithium-ion batteries are becoming
a common replacement for the lead-acid batteries that
have been used historically for golf carts and utility
vehicles. Instead of heavy lead plates and acid elec-
trolyte,thetrendistouselightweightlithium-ionbattery
packs that can provide the same voltage as lead-acid bat-
teries, so no modiﬁcation to the vehicle’s drive system
is required.
Chemistry, performance, cost and safety characteris-
tics vary across LIB types. Handheld electronics mostly
use LIBs based on lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2),
which offers high energy density, but presents safety
risks,especiallywhendamaged.Lithiumironphosphate
(LiFePO4), lithium manganese oxide (LMnO or LMO)
and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMn-
CoO2 or NMC) offer lower energy density, but longer
lives and inherent safety. Such batteries are widely used
for electric tools, medical equipment and other roles.
NMC in particular is a leading contender for auto-
motive applications. Lithium nickel cobalt aluminium
oxide (LiNiCoAlO2 or NCA) and lithium titanate
(Li4Ti5O12 or LTO) are specialty designs aimed at par-
ticular niche roles. The new lithium sulphur batteries
promise the highest performance to weight ratio.
Lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous under some
conditions and can pose a safety hazard since they con-
tain, unlike other rechargeable batteries, a ﬂammable
electrolyte and are also kept pressurized. Because of this
the testing standards for these batteries are more strin-
gent than those for acid-electrolyte batteries, requiring
both a broader range of test conditions and additional
battery-speciﬁc tests. This is in response to reported
accidents and failures, and there have been battery-
related recalls by some companies.
For many years, nickel-cadmium had been the only
suitable battery for portable equipment from wireless
communications to mobile computing. Nickel-metal-
hydride and lithium-ion emerged in the early 1990s
and today, lithium-ion is the fastest growing and most
promising battery chemistry. Pioneer work with the
lithium battery began in 1912 under G.N. Lewis but
it was not until the early 1970s when the ﬁrst non-
rechargeable lithium batteries became commercially

available. Lithium is the lightest of all metals, has
the greatest electrochemical potential and provides the
largest energy density for weight.
Attempts to develop rechargeable lithium batteries
initially failed due to safety problems. Because of the
inherent instability of lithium metal, especially dur-
ing charging, research shifted to a non-metallic lithium
battery using lithium ions. Although slightly lower
in energy density than lithium metal, lithium-ion is
safe, provided certain precautions are met when charg-
ing and discharging. In 1991, the Sony Corporation
commercialized the ﬁrst lithium-ion battery and other
manufacturers followed suit.
The energy density of lithium-ion is typically twice
that of the standard nickel-cadmium. There is poten-
tial for higher energy densities. The load characteristics
are reasonably good and behave similarly to nickel-
cadmium in terms of discharge. The high cell voltage
of 3.6 volts allows battery pack designs with only one
cell. Most of today’s mobile phones run on a single cell.
A nickel-based pack would require three 1.2-volt cells
connected in series.
Lithium-ion is a low maintenance battery, an advan-
tage that most other chemistries cannot claim. There
is no memory and no scheduled cycling is required to
prolong the battery’s life. In addition, the self-discharge
is less than half compared to nickel-cadmium, making
lithium-ion well suited for modern fuel gauge applica-
tions. Lithium-ion cells cause little harm whendisposed.
Despite its overall advantages, lithium-ion has its
drawbacks. It is fragile and requires a protection circuit
to maintain safe operation.Built into each pack, the pro-
tection circuit limits the peak voltage of each cell during
charge and prevents the cell voltage from dropping too
low on discharge. In addition, the cell temperature is
monitored to prevent temperature extremes. The max-
imum charge and discharge current on most packs are
limited to between 1◦C and 2◦C. With these precau-
tions in place, the possibility of metallic lithium plating
occurring due to overcharge is virtually eliminated.
Ageing is a concern with most lithium-ion batteries
and many manufacturers remain silent about this issue.
Some capacity deteriorationis noticeable after one year,
whether the battery is in use or not. The battery fre-
quently fails after two or three years. It should be noted
thatotherchemistriesalsohaveage-relateddegenerative
effects. This is especially true for nickel-metal-hydride
if exposed to high ambient temperatures. At the same
time, lithium-ion packs are known to have served for
ﬁve years in some applications.
Manufacturers are constantly improving lithium-
ion. New and enhanced chemical combinations are
introduced every six months or so. With such rapid
progress, it is difﬁcult to assess how well the revised
battery will age.
Storage in a cool place slows the ageing process
of lithium-ion (and other chemistries). Manufactur-
ers recommend storage temperatures of 15◦C (59◦F).
In addition, the battery should be partially charged
during storage; the manufacturer recommends a 40%
charge.
The most economical lithium-ion battery in terms
of cost-to-energy ratio is the cylindrical 18650 (size is
18mm x 65.2mm). This cell is used for mobile comput-
ing and other applications that do not demand ultra-thin
geometry. If a slim pack is required, the prismatic
lithium-ion cell is the best choice. These cells come at
a higher cost in terms of stored energy.
Summary of advantages of lithium-ion batteries
(i)
High energy density – potential for yet higher
capacities.
(ii)
Does not need prolonged priming when new; one
regular charge is all that’s needed.
(iii)
Relatively low self-discharge – is less than half
that of nickel-based batteries.
(iv)
Low maintenance – no periodic discharge is
needed; there is no memory.
(v)
Speciality cells can provide very high current to
applications such as power tools.
Summary of limitations of lithium-ion batteries
(i)
Requires protection circuit to maintain voltage
and current within safe limits.
(ii)
Subject to ageing, even if not in use – storage in a
cool place at 40% charge reduces the aging effect.
(iii)
Expensive to manufacture – about 40% higher in
cost than nickel-cadmium.
(iv)
Not fully mature – metals and chemicals are
changing on a continuing basis.
To extend the battery life of lithium-ion batteries:
(i)
Keep batteries at room temperature, meaning
between 20◦C and 25◦C; heat is by far the greatest
factor in reducing lithium-ion battery life.
(ii)
Obtain a high-capacity lithium-ion battery,
rather than carrying a spare; batteries deterio-
rate over time, whether they’re being used or not
so a spare battery won’t last much longer than the
one in use.

Part 2
84
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(iii)
Allow partial discharges and avoid full ones;
unlike NiCad batteries, lithium-ion batteries do
not have a charge memory, which means that
deep-discharge cycles are not required – in fact,
it’s better for the battery to use partial-discharge
cycles.
(iv)
Avoid completely discharging lithium-ion bat-
teries; if a lithium-ion battery is dischargedbelow
2.5 volts per cell, a safety circuit built into the
battery opens and the battery appears to be dead
and the original charger will be of no use – only
battery analyzers with the boost function have a
chance of recharging the battery.
(v)
For extended storage, discharge a lithium-ion
battery to about 40% and store it in a cool
place.
Lithium-ion batteries are a huge improvement over
previous types of batteries and getting 500 charge/dis-
charge cycles from a lithium-ion battery is becoming
commonplace.
6.9 Cell capacity
The capacity of a cell is measured in ampere-hours
(Ah). A fully charged 50Ah battery rated for 10h dis-
charge can be discharged at a steady current of 5A for
10h, but if the load current is increased to 10A then the
battery is discharged in 3–4h, since the higher the dis-
charge current, the lower is the effective capacity of the
battery.Typical dischargecharacteristics for a lead–acid
cell are shown in Figure 6.9.

6.10 Safe disposal of batteries
Battery disposal has become a topical subject in the
UK because of greater awareness of the dangers and
implications of depositing up to 300 million batteries
per annum – a waste stream of over 20000 tonnes – into
landﬁll sites.
Certain batteries contain substances which can be a
hazard to humans, wildlife and the environment,as well
as posing a ﬁre risk. Other batteries can be recycled for
their metal content.
Waste batteries are a concentrated source of toxic
heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium. If
batteries containing heavy metals are disposed of incor-
rectly, the metals can leach out and pollute the soil
and groundwater, endangering humans and wildlife.
Long-term exposure to cadmium, a known human car-
cinogen (i.e. a substance producing cancerous growth),
can cause liver and lung disease. Mercury can cause
damage to the human brain, spinal system, kidneys and
liver. Sulphuric acid in lead–acid batteries can cause
severe skin burns or irritation upon contact. It is increas-
ingly important to correctly dispose of all types of
batteries.
Table 6.2 lists types of batteries, their common uses,
their hazardous components and disposal recycling
options.
Battery disposal has become more regulatedsince the
Landﬁll Regulations 2002 and Hazardous Waste Regu-
lations 2005. From the Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2006, commencing
July 2007 all producers (manufacturers and importers)
of electrical and electronic equipment will be responsi-
ble for the cost of collection, treatment and recycling of
obligated WEEE generated in the UK.
6.11 Fuel cells
A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion
device, similar to a battery, but differing from the latter
in that it is designed for continuous replenishment of
the reactants consumed, i.e. it produces electricity from
an external source of fuel and oxygen, as opposed to
the limited energy storage capacity of a battery. Also,
the electrodes within a battery react and change as a
battery is charged or discharged, whereas a fuel cell’s
electrodes are catalytic (i.e. not permanently changed)
and relatively stable.
Typical reactants used in a fuel cell are hydrogen
on the anode side and oxygen on the cathode side
(i.e. a hydrogen cell). Usually, reactants ﬂow in and
reaction products ﬂow out. Virtually continuous long-
term operation is feasible as long as these ﬂows are
maintained.
Fuel cells are very attractive in modern applications
for their high efﬁciency and ideally emission-free use, in

Part 2
Batteries and alternative sources of energy
85
contrast to currently more modern fuels such as methane
or natural gas that generate carbon dioxide. The only
by-product of a fuel cell operating on pure hydrogen is
water vapour.
Currently, fuel cells are a very expensive alterna-
tive to internal combustion engines. However, continued
research and development is likely to make fuel cell
vehicles available at market prices within a few years.
Fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote
locations, such as spacecraft, remote weather stations,
and in certain military applications. A fuel cell running
on hydrogen can be compact, lightweight and has no
moving parts.
6.12 Alternative and renewable
energy sources
Alternative energy refers to energy sources which
could replace coal, traditional gas and oil, all of
which increase the atmospheric carbon when burned
as fuel.
Renewable energy implies that it is derived from a
source which is automatically replenished or one that is
effectively inﬁnite so that it is not depleted as it is used.
Coal, gas and oil are not renewable because, although
the ﬁelds may last for generations, their time span is
ﬁnite and will eventually run out.
There are many means of harnessing energy which
have less damaging impacts on our environment, includ-
ing the following:
1.
Solar energy is one of the most resourcefulsources
of energy for the future. The reason for this is that
the total energy received each year from the sun is
around 35000 times the total energy used by man.
However, about one-third of this energy is either
absorbed by the outer atmosphere or reﬂected back
into space. Solar energy could be used to run cars,
power plants and space ships. Solar panels on roofs
capture heat in water storage systems. Photovoltaic
cells, when suitably positioned, convert sunlight to
electricity. For more on solar energy, see Section
6.13 following.
2.
Wind power is another alternative energy source
that can be used without producing by-products
that are harmful to nature. The ﬁns of a windmill
rotate in a vertical plane which is kept vertical to
the wind by means of a tail ﬁn and as wind ﬂow
crosses the blades of the windmill it is forced to
rotate and can be used to generate electricity (see
Chapter 11). Like solar power, harnessing the wind
is highly dependent upon weather and location.
The average wind velocity of Earth is around 9m/s,
and the power that could be produced when a
windmill is facing a wind of 10m.p.h. (i.e. around
4.5m/s) is around 50 watts.
3.
Hydroelectricity is achieved by the damming
of rivers and utilizing the potential energy in the
water. As the water stored behind a dam is released
at high pressure, its kinetic energy is transferred
onto turbine blades and used to generate electricity.
The system has enormous initial costs but has
relatively low maintenance costs and provides
power quite cheaply.

Tidal power utilizes the natural motion of the tides
to ﬁll reservoirs which are then slowly discharged
through electricity-producing turbines.
5.
Geothermal energy is obtained from the internal
heat of the planet and can be used to generate steam
to run a steam turbine which, in turn, generates
electricity. The radius of the Earth is about 4000
miles, with an internal core temperature of around
4000◦C at the centre. Drilling 3 miles from the
surface of the Earth, a temperature of 100◦C is
encountered; this is sufﬁcient to boil water to run
a steam-powered electric power plant. Although
drilling 3 miles down is possible, it is not easy.
Fortunately, however, volcanic features called
geothermal hotspots are found all around the
world. These are areas which transmit excess inter-
nal heat from the interior of the Earth to the outer
crust, which can be used to generate electricity.
Advantages of geothermal power include being
environmentally friendly, global warming effects
are mitigated, has no fuel costs, gives predictable
24/7 power, has a high load factor and no pollution.
Disadvantages of geothermal power include
having a long gestation time leading to possible
cost overruns, slow technology improvement,
problems with ﬁnancing, innumerable regulations,
and having limited locations.

Biomass is fuel that is developed from organic
materials, a renewable and sustainable source of
energy used to create electricity or other forms
of power. Some examples of materials that make
up biomass fuels are scrap lumber, forest debris,
certain crops, manure and some types of waste
residues. With a constant supply of waste – from
construction and demolition activities, to wood not
used in papermaking, to municipal solid waste –
green energy production can continue indeﬁnitely.
There are several methods to convert biomass

Part 2
86
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
into electricity and these are brieﬂy discussed in
Chapter 21.
6.13 Solar energy
Solar energy – power from the sun – is a vast and inex-
haustible resource. Once a system is in place toconvert it
into useful energy, the fuel is free and will never be sub-
ject to the variations of energy markets. Furthermore,
it represents a clean alternative to the fossil fuels that
currently pollute air and water, threaten public health
and contribute to global warming. Given the abundance
and the appeal of solar energy, this resource will play a
prominent role in our energy future.
In the broadest sense, solar energy supports all life
on Earth and is the basis for almost every form of
energy used. The sun makes plants grow, which can
be burned as ’biomass’ fuel or, if left to rot in swamps
and compressed underground for millions of years, in
the form of coal and oil. Heat from the sun causes
temperature differences between areas, producing wind
that can power turbines. Water evaporates because of
the sun, falls on high elevations and rushes down to
the sea, spinning hydroelectric turbines as it passes.
However, solar energy usually refers to ways the sun’s
energy can be used to directlygenerateheat,lightingand
electricity.
The amount of energy from the sun that falls on the
Earth’s surface is enormous. All the energy stored in
Earth’s reserves of coal, oil and natural gas is matched
by the energy from just 20 days of sunshine.
Originally developed for energy requirements for an
orbiting earth satellite, solar power has expanded in
recent years for use in domestic and industrial needs.
Solar power is produced by collecting sunlight and con-
verting it into electricity. This is achieved by using solar
panels, which are large ﬂat panels made up of many
individual solar cells.
Some advantages of solar power
(a)
The major advantage of solar power is that no
pollution is created in the process of generating
electricity. Environmentally it is the most clean
and green energy. It is renewable (unlike gas, oil
and coal) and sustainable, helping to protect the
environment.
(b)
Solar energy does not require any fuel.
(c)
Solar energy does not pollute air by releasing car-
bon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide or
mercury into the atmosphere like many traditional
forms of electrical generation do.
(d)
Solar energy does not contribute to global warm-
ing, acid rain or smog. It actively contributes to the
decrease of harmful green house gas emissions.
(e)
There is no on-going cost for the power solar
energy generates, as solar radiation is free every-
where; once installed, there are no recurring
costs.
(f)
Solar energy can be ﬂexibly applied to a variety of
stationary or portable applications. Unlike most
forms of electrical generation, the panels can be
made small enough to ﬁt pocket-size electronic
devices, such as a calculator, orsufﬁciently large to
charge an automobile battery or supply electricity
to entire buildings.
(g)
Solar energy offers much more self-reliance than
depending upon a power utility for all electricity.
(h)
Solar energy is quite economical in the long run.
After the initial investment has been recovered,
the energy from the sun is practically free. Solar
energy systems are virtually maintenance free and
will last for decades.
(i)
Solar energy is unaffected by the supply and
demand of fuel and is therefore not subjected to
the ever-increasing price of fossil fuel.
(j)
By not using any fuel, solar energy does not con-
tribute to the cost and problems of the recoveryand
transportation of fuel or the storage of radioactive
waste.
(k)
Solar energy is generated where it is needed, hence
large scale transmission cost is minimized.
(l)
Solar energy can be utilized to offset utility-
supplied energy consumption. It does not only
reduce electricity bills, but will also continue to
supply homes/businesses with electricity in the
event of a power outage.
(m)
A solar energy system can operate entirely inde-
pendently,not requiringa connectionto a poweror
gas grid at all. Systems can therefore be installed
in remote locations, making it more practical and
cost-effective than the supply of utility electricity
to a new site.
(n)
Solar energy projects operate silently, have no
moving parts, do not release offensive smells and
do not require the addition of any additional fuel.
(o)
Solar energy projects support local job and wealth
creation, fuelling local economies.
Some disadvantages of solar power
(a)
The initial cost is the main disadvantage of
installing a solar energy system, largely because

Part 2
Batteries and alternative sources of energy
87
of the high cost of the semi-conducting materials
used in building solar panels.
(b)
The cost of solar energy is also high compared
to non-renewable utility-supplied electricity. As
energy shortages are becoming more common,
solar energy is becoming more price-competitive.
(c)
Solar panels require quite a large area for installa-
tion to achieve a good level of efﬁciency.
(d)
The efﬁciency of the system also relies on the
location of the sun, although this problem can be
overcome with the installation of certain compo-
nents.
(e)
The production of solar energy is inﬂuenced by
the presence of clouds or pollution in the air. Sim-
ilarly, no solar energy will be produced during the
night although a battery backup system and/or net
metering will solve this problem.
Some applications of solar energy
(i)
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP): Concen-
trating solar power (CSP) plants are utility-
scale generators that produce electricity using
mirrors or lenses to efﬁciently concentrate the
sun’s energy. The four principal CSP technolo-
gies are parabolic troughs, dish-Stirling engine
systems, central receivers and concentrating
photovoltaic systems (CPV).
(ii)
Solar Thermal Electric Power Plants: Solar
thermal energy involves harnessing solar
power
for
practical
applications
from
solar heating to electrical power genera-
tion. Solar thermal collectors, such as solar
hot water panels, are commonly used to gen-
erate solar hot water for domestic and light
industrial applications. This energy system
is also used in architecture and building design
to control heating and ventilation in both
active solar and passive solar designs.
(iii)
Photovoltaics: Photovoltaic or PV technol-
ogy employs solar cells or solar photovoltaic
arrays to convert energy from the sun into
electricity. Solar cells produce direct current
electricity from the sun’s rays, which can be
used to power equipment or to recharge bat-
teries. Many pocket calculators incorporate
a single solar cell, but for larger applications,
cells are generally grouped together to form
PV modules that are in turn arranged in solar
arrays.Solararrayscanbeusedtopowerorbit-
ing satellites and other spacecraft, and in
remote areas as a source of power for road-
side emergency telephones, remote sensing,
school crossing warning signs and cathodic
protection of pipelines.
(iv)
Solar Heating Systems: Solar hot water sys-
tems use sunlight to heat water. The systems
are composed of solar thermal collectors and
a storage tank, and they may be active, passive
or batch systems.
(v)
Passive Solar Energy: Building designers are
concerned to maintain the building environ-
ment at a comfortable temperature through the
sun’s daily and annual cycles. This can be
achieved by: (a) direct gain in which the posi-
tioning of windows, skylights, and shutters to
control the amount of direct solar radiation
reaching the interior and warming the air and
surfaces within a building, (b) indirect gain
in which solar radiation is captured by a part
of the building envelope and then transmitted
indirectly to the building through conduction
and convection, and (c) isolated gain which
involves passively capturing solar heat and
then moving it passively into or out of the
building via a liquid or air directly or using
a thermal store. Sunspaces, greenhouses and
solar closets are alternative ways of capturing
isolated heat gain from which warmed air can
be taken.
(vi)
Solar Lighting: Also known as day-lighting,
solar lighting is the use of natural light to pro-
vide illumination to offset energy use in elec-
tric lighting systems and reduce the cooling
load on high voltage a.c.systems. Day-lighting
features include building orientation, window
orientation, exterior shading, saw-tooth roofs,
clerestory windows, light shelves, skylights
and light tubes. Architectural trends increas-
ingly recognise day-lighting as a cornerstone
of sustainable design.
(vii)
Solar Cars: A solar car is an electric vehicle
powered by energy obtained from solar pan-
els on the surface of the car which convert
the sun’s energy directly into electrical energy.
Solar cars are not currently a practical form of
transportation. Although they can operate for
limited distances without sun, the solar cells
are generally very fragile. Development teams
have focused their efforts on optimising the
efﬁciency of the vehicle, but many have only
enough room for one or two people.

(viii)
Solar Power Satellite: A solar power satel-
lite (SPS) is a proposed satellite built in high
Earth orbit that uses microwave power trans-
mission to beam solar power to a very large
antenna on Earth where it can be used in place
of conventional power sources. The advantage
of placing the solar collectors in space is the
unobstructed view of thesun,unaffectedbythe
day/night cycle, weather or seasons. However,
the costs of construction are very high, and
SPSs will not be able to compete with conven-
tional sources unless low launch costs can be
achieved or unless a space-based manufactur-
ing industry develops and they can be built in
orbit from off-earth materials.
(ix)
Solar Updraft Tower: A solar updraft tower
is a proposed type of renewable-energy power
plant. Air is heated in a very large circular
greenhouse-like structure, and the resulting
convection causes the air to rise and escape
through a tall tower. The moving air drives tur-
bines, which produce electricity. There are no
solar updraft towers in operation at present. A
research prototype operated in Spain in the 1980s,
and EnviroMission is proposing to construct a
full-scale power station using this technology in
Australia.
(x)
Renewable Solar Power Systems with Regener-
ative Fuel Cell Systems: NASA in the USA has
long recognised the unique advantages of regen-
erative fuel cell (RFC) systems to provide energy
storage for solar power systems in space. RFC
systems are uniquely qualiﬁed to provide the nec-
essary energy storage for solar surface power sys-
tems on the moon or Mars during long periods of
darkness, i.e. during the 14-day lunar night or the
12-hour Martian night. The nature of the RFC and
its inherent design ﬂexibility enables it to effec-
tively meet the requirements of space missions.
In the course of implementing the NASA RFC
Programme, researchers recognised that there are
numerous applications in government, industry,
transportation and the military for RFC systems
as well.

Series and parallel networks
Why it is important to understand: Series and parallel networks
There are two ways in which components may be connected together in an electric circuit. One way is ‘in
series’ where components are connected ‘end-to-end’; another way is ‘in parallel’ where components are
connected ‘across each other’. When a circuit is more complicated than two or three elements, it is very
likely to be a network of individual series and parallel circuits. A ﬁrm understanding ofthe basic principles
associatedwithseriesandparallelcircuitsisasufﬁcientbackgroundtobeginaninvestigationofanysingle-
source d.c. network having a combination of series and parallel elements or branches. Conﬁdence in the
analysis of series-parallel networks comes only through exposure, practice and experience. At ﬁrst glance,
these circuits may seem very complicated, but with a methodical analysis approach the functionality of
the circuit can become obvious. This chapter explains with examples, series, parallel and series/parallel
networks. The relationships between voltages, currents and resistances for these networks are considered
through calculations.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
calculate unknown voltages, currents and resistances in a series circuit
•

7.1 Series circuits
Figure 7.1 shows three resistors, R1, R2 and R3, con-
nected end to end, i.e. in series, with a battery source
of V volts. Since the circuit is closed a current I will
ﬂow and the p.d. across each resistor may be determined
from the voltmeter readings V1, V2 and V3

In a series circuit
(a)
The current I is the same in all parts of the circuit
and hence the same reading is found on each of
the two ammeters shown.
(b)
The sum of the voltages V1, V2 and V3 is equal to
the total applied voltage, V , i.e.
V = V1 + V2 + V3
From Ohm’s law:
V1 = IR1,V2 = IR2,V3 = IR3 and V = IR
where R is the total circuit resistance.
Since V =V1 + V2 + V3
then IR =IR1+IR2+IR3
Dividing throughout by I gives
R = R1 + R2 + R3
Thus for a series circuit, the total resistance is obtained
by adding together the values of the separate resistances.
Problem 1.
For the circuit shown in Figure 7.2,
determine (a) the battery voltage V , (b) the total
resistance of the circuit, and (c) the values of

p.d. across R1, i.e. V1 =IR1 =(25)(2.5)=62.5V
p.d. across Rx, i.e. Vx =IRx =(25)(1.5)=37.5V
p.d. across R4, i.e. V4 =IR4 =(25)(4)=100V
Hence the p.d. across R2 =p.d. across R3 =37.5V

Problem 12.
For the circuit shown in Figure 7.24
calculate (a) the value of resistor Rx such that the
total power dissipated in the circuit is 2.5kW, and
(b) the current ﬂowing in each of the four resistors.
Figure 7.24
(a)
Power dissipated P =VI watts, hence
2500= (250)(I)
i.e. I = 2500
250 = 10A
From Ohm’s law, RT = V
I = 250
10 =25, where
RT is the equivalent circuit resistance.
The equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 in
parallel is
15 × 10
15 + 10 = 150
25 = 6
The equivalent resistance of resistors R3 and Rx
in parallel is equal to 25 −6, i.e. 19.
There are three methods whereby Rx can be
determined.
Method 1
The voltage V1 =IR, where R is 6, from above,
i.e. V1 =(10)(6)=60V
HenceV2=250V−60V=190V=p.d. across R3
=p.d. across Rx
I3 = V2
R3
= 190
38 =5A. Thus I4 =5A also,
since I =10A
Thus Rx = V2
I4
= 190
5 =38
Method 2
Since the equivalent resistance of R3 and Rx in
parallel is 19,
19 =
38Rx
38 + Rx

i.e. product
sum

Hence 19(38 + Rx) = 38Rx
722 + 19Rx = 38Rx
722 = 38Rx −19Rx = 19Rx
Thus Rx = 722
19 =38
Method 3
When two resistors having the same value are
connected in parallel the equivalent resistance is
always half the value of one of the resistors.
Thus, in this case, since RT =19 and R3 =38,
then Rx = 38 could have been deduced on
sight.

7.5 Loading effect
Loading effect is the terminology used when a measur-
ing instrument such as an oscilloscope or voltmeter is
connected across a component and the current drawn
by the instrument upsets the circuit under test. The best
way of demonstrating loading effect is by a numerical
example.
In the simple circuit of Figure 7.32,the voltage across
each of the resistors can be calculated using voltage
division,orbyinspection.Inthiscase,thevoltageshown
as V should be 20 V.

The voltage V now equals
375 × 103
(1 × 106 + 375 × 103) × 40

The voltmeter has loaded the circuit by drawing cur-
rent for its operation, and by so doing, reduces the
voltage across the 1M resistor from the correct value
of 20 V to 10.91 V.

Using a Fluke (or multimeter) which has a set inter-
nal resistance of, say, 10M, as shown in Figure 7.34,
produces a much better result and the loading effect is
minimal, as shown below.
Resistance of parallel section = 1 × 106 × 10 × 106
(1 × 106 + 10× 106)
= 0.91M
The voltage V now equals
0.91 × 106
(0.91 × 106 + 1 × 106) × 40
= 19.06 V
When taking measurements, it is vital that the load-
ing effect is understood and kept in mind at all times.
An incorrect voltage reading may be due to this load-
ing effect rather than the equipment under investigation
being defective. Ideally, the resistance of a voltmeter
should be inﬁnite.
7.6 Potentiometers and rheostats
It is frequently desirable to be able to vary the value of
a resistor in a circuit. A simple example of this is the
volume control of a radio or television set.
Voltages and currents may be varied in electrical circuits
by using potentiometers and rheostats.
Potentiometers
When a variable resistor uses three terminals, it is
known as a potentiometer. The potentiometer provides
an adjustable voltage divider circuit, which is useful
as a means of obtaining various voltages from a ﬁxed
potential difference. Consider the potentiometer circuit
shown in Figure 7.35 incorporating a lamp and supply
voltage V .
V
S
Potentiometer

B
Lamp


Figure 7.35
In the circuit of Figure 7.35, the input voltage is
applied across points A and B at the ends of the poten-
tiometer, while the output is tapped off between the
sliding contact S and the ﬁxed end B. It will be seen that
with the slider at the far left-hand end of the resistor,
the full voltage will appear across the lamp, and as the
slider is movedtowards point B the lamp brightness will
reduce. When S is at the far right of the potentiometer,
the lamp is short-circuited, no current will ﬂow through
it, and the lamp will be fully off.
Problem 14.

Figure 7.38
The volt drop across the 37.5  resistor in Figure 7.38
is the same as the volt drop across both of the parallel
resistors in Figure 7.37.
There are two methods for determining the volt
drop, VSB:
Method 1
Total circuit resistance, RT = 100 + 37.5 = 137.5
Hence, supply current, I =
30
137.5 = 0.2182A
Thus, volt drop, VSB = I × 37.5 = 0.2182 × 37.5
= 8.18 V
Method 2
By the principle of voltage division,
VSB =

37.5
100 + 37.5

(30) = 8.18V
Hence, the volt drop across the 60 load of
Figure 7.36 is 8.18 V
Rheostats
A variable resistor where only two terminals are used,
one ﬁxed and one sliding, is known as a rheostat. The
rheostat circuit, shown in Figure 7.39, similar in con-
structiontothepotentiometer,isusedtocontrolcurrent
ﬂow. The rheostat also acts as a dropping resistor, reduc-
ing the voltage across the load, but is more effective at
controlling current.
For this reason the resistance of the rheostat should
be greater than that of the load, otherwise it will
have little or no effect. Typical uses are in a train set
or Scalextric. Another practical example is in varying
the brilliance of the panel lighting controls in a car.

The rheostat resistance is connected in series with
the load circuit, RL, with the slider arm tapping off an
amount of resistance (i.e. that between A and S) to pro-
vide the current ﬂow required. With the slider at the far
left-hand end, the load receives maximum current; with
the slider at the far right-hand end, minimum current
ﬂows. The current ﬂowing can be calculated by ﬁnding
the total resistance of the circuit (i.e. RT = RAS + RL),
then by applying Ohm’s law, I T =
V
RAS + RL
Calculations involved with the rheostat circuit are
simpler than those for the potentiometer circuit.

Summary
A potentiometer (a) has three terminals, and (b) is used
for voltage control.
A rheostat (a) has two terminals, (b) is used for current
control.
A rheostat is not suitable if the load resistance is higher
than the rheostat resistance; rheostat resistance must be
higher than the load resistance to be able to inﬂuence
current ﬂow.

7.7 Relative and absolute voltages
In an electrical circuit, the voltage at any point can
be quoted as being ‘with reference to’ (w.r.t.) any
other point in the circuit. Consider the circuit shown
in Figure 7.46. The total resistance,
RT = 30 + 50+ 5 + 15 = 100
and current, I = 200
100 = 2A
I = 2A

30Ω
50Ω

C
Figure 7.46
If a voltage at point A is quoted with reference to
point B then the voltage is written as VAB. This is
known as a ‘relative voltage’. In the circuit shown
in Figure 7.46, the voltage at A w.r.t. B is I ×50, i.e.
2 × 50=100V and is written as VAB =100V
It must also be indicated whether the voltage at A
w.r.t. B is closer to the positive terminal or the negative
terminal of the supply source. Point A is nearer to the
positive terminal than B so is written as VAB =100V or
VAB =+100V or VAB =100V+ve.
If no positive or negative is included, then the voltage is
always taken to be positive.
If the voltage at B w.r.t. A is required, then VBA is nega-
tive and written as VBA =−100V or VBA =100V −ve.
If the reference point is changed to the earth point
then any voltage taken w.r.t. the earth is known as
an ‘absolute potential’. If the absolute voltage of
A in Figure 7.46 is required, then this will be the
sum of the voltages across the 50 and 5 resistors,
i.e. 100+10=110V and is written as VA =110V or
VA =+110V or VA =110V +ve, positive since mov-
ing from the earth point to point A is moving towards
the positive terminal of the source. If the voltage is
negative w.r.t. earth then this must be indicated; for
example, VC =30V negative w.r.t. earth, and is written
as VC =−30V or VC =30V −ve.
Problem 16.

The voltage at the earth point is 0 volts. The volt
drop across the 4k is 12V, from part (a). Since
moving from the earth point to point X is mov-
ing towards the negative terminal of the voltage
source, the voltage at point X w.r.t. earth is −12V.
(e)
The ‘absolute voltage at point X’ means the ‘volt-
age at point X w.r.t. earth’, hence the absolute
voltage at point X is −12V. Questions (d) and
(e) mean the same thing.

7.8 Earth potential and short circuits
The earth, and hence the sea, is at a potential of zero
volts. Items connected to the earth (or sea), i.e. cir-
cuit wiring and electrical components, are said to be
earthed or at earth potential. This means that there is no
difference of potential between the item and earth. A
ship’s hull, being immersed in the sea, is at earth poten-
tial and therefore at zero volts. Earth faults, or short
circuits, are caused by low resistance between the
current-carryingconductor and earth. This occurs when
the insulation resistance of the circuit wiring decreases,
and is normally caused by:
1.
dampness
2.
insulation becoming hard or brittle with age or heat
3.
accidental damage.

and in parallel
Series connection
Figure 7.51 shows three lamps, each rated at 240V,
connected in series across a 240V supply.
Figure 7.51
(i)
Each lamp has only 240
3 V, i.e. 80V across it and
thus each lamp glows dimly.
(ii)
If another lamp of similar rating is added in series
with the other three lamps then each lamp now has
240
4 V, i.e. 60V across it and each now glows even
more dimly.
(iii)
If a lamp is removed from the circuit or if a lamp
develops a fault (i.e. an open circuit) or if the
switch is opened, then the circuit is broken, no
current ﬂows, and the remaining lamps will not
light up.
(iv)
Less cable is required for a series connection than
for a parallel one.
The series connection of lamps is usually limited to
decorative lighting such as for Christmas tree lights.
Parallel connection

240V, connected in parallel across a 240V supply.

Each lamp has 240V across it and thus each will

(iii)
The addition of further similar lamps in parallel
does not affect the brightness of the other lamps.

Chapter 8
Capacitors and capacitance
Why it is important to understand: Capacitance and capacitors
The capacitor is a widely used electrical component and it has several features that make it useful and
important. A capacitor can store energy, so capacitors are often found in power supplies. Capacitors
are used for timing – for example with a 555 timer IC controlling the charging and discharging; for
smoothing – for example in a power supply; for coupling – for example between stages of an audio system
and a loudspeaker; for ﬁltering – for example in the tone control of an audio system; for tuning – for
example in a radio system; and for storing energy – for example in a camera ﬂash circuit. Capacitors
ﬁnd uses in virtually every form of electronics circuit from analogue circuits, including ampliﬁers and
power supplies, through to oscillators, integrators and many more. Capacitors are also used in logic
circuits, primarily for providing decoupling to prevent spikes and ripple on the supply lines which could
cause spurious triggering of the circuits. Capacitors are often used in car stereo systems and hooked up
to the sub-woofer speaker because the loud bass ‘boom’ sounds require a lot of power: the capacitors
store a steady amount of charge and then quickly release it when the sub needs it for its boom. In some
applications a capacitor can be used to reduce the spark created by the opening of the points on a switch
or relay. A capacitor has a voltage that is proportional to the charge that is stored in the capacitor, so a
capacitor can be used to perform interesting computations in op-amp circuits. Circuits with capacitors
exhibit frequency-dependent behaviour so that circuits that amplify certain frequencies selectively can
be built. Capacitors are very important components in electrical and electronic circuits, and this chapter
introduces the terminology and calculations to aid understanding.

8.1 Introduction to capacitors
A capacitor is an electrical device that is used to
store electrical energy. Next to the resistor, the capac-
itor is the most commonly encountered component in
electrical circuits. Capacitors are used extensively in
electrical and electronic circuits. For example, capac-
itors are used to smooth rectiﬁed a.c. outputs, they are
used in telecommunication equipment – such as radio
receivers – for tuning to the required frequency,they are
used in time delay circuits, in electrical ﬁlters, in oscil-
lator circuits and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
in medical body scanners, to name but a few practical
applications.
Some typical small capacitors are shown in Figure 8.1.
Figure 8.1
8.2 Electrostatic ﬁeld
Figure 8.2 represents two parallel metal plates, A and B,
charged to different potentials. If an electron that has a
negativechargeis placed betweenthe plates, a forcewill
act on the electron,tending to push it away from the neg-
ative plate B towards the positive plate, A. Similarly, a
positive charge would be acted on by a force tending to
move it towards the negative plate. Any region such as
that shown between the plates in Figure 8.2, in which
an electric charge experiences a force, is called an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld. The direction of the ﬁeld is deﬁned as
A

Figure 8.2 Electrostatic ﬁeld
that of the force acting on a positive charge placed in
the ﬁeld. In Figure 8.2, the direction of the force is from
the positive plate to the negative plate.
Such a ﬁeld may be represented in magnitude and
direction by lines of electric force drawn between the
chargedsurfaces. The closeness of the lines is an indica-
tion of the ﬁeld strength. Whenever a p.d. is established
between two points, an electric ﬁeld will always exist.
Figure 8.3(a) shows a typical ﬁeld pattern for an isolated
point charge, and Figure 8.3(b) shows the ﬁeld pattern
for adjacent charges of opposite polarity. Electric lines
of force (often called electric ﬂux lines) are continu-
ous and start and ﬁnish on point charges. Also, the lines
cannot cross each other. When a charged body is placed
close to an uncharged body, an induced charge of oppo-
site sign appears on the surface of the uncharged body.
This is because lines of force from the charged body
terminate on its surface.
The concept of ﬁeld lines or lines of force is used
to illustrate the properties of an electric ﬁeld. However,
it should be remembered that they are only aids to the
imagination.
The force of attraction or repulsion between two elec-
trically charged bodies is proportional to the magnitude
of their charges and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance separating them,
i.e. force ∝q1q2
d2
or
force = k q1q2
d2
where constant k ≈9×109 in air
This is known as Coulomb’s law∗.

8.3 Electric ﬁeld strength
Figure 8.4 shows two parallel conducting plates sep-
arated from each other by air. They are connected to
opposite terminals of a battery of voltage V volts.
There is therefore an electric ﬁeld in the space
between the plates. If the plates are close together, the
electric lines of force will be straight and parallel and
equally spaced, except near the edge where fringingwill

occur (see Figure 8.2). Over the area in which there is
negligible fringing,
Electric ﬁeld strength, E = V
d volts/metre
where d is the distance between the plates. Electric ﬁeld
strength is also called potential gradient.
8.4 Capacitance
Static electric ﬁelds arise from electric charges, elec-
tric ﬁeld lines beginning and ending on electric charges.
Thus the presence of the ﬁeld indicates the presence of
equal positive and negative electric charges on the two
plates of Figure 8.4. Let the charge be +Q coulombs on
one plate and −Q coulombs on the other. The property
of this pair of plates which determineshow muchcharge
corresponds to a given p.d. between the plates is called
their capacitance:
capacitance C = Q
V
The unit of capacitance is the farad, F (or more usually
μF = 10−6 F or pF = 10−12 F), which is deﬁned as the
capacitance when a p.d. of one volt appears across the
plates when charged with one coulomb. The unit farad
is named after Michael Faraday.∗

8.5 Capacitors
Every system of electrical conductors possesses capac-
itance. For example, there is capacitance between the
conductors of overhead transmission lines and also
between the wires of a telephone cable. In these exam-
ples the capacitance is undesirable but has to be accep-
ted, minimized or compensated for. There are other
situations where capacitance is a desirable property.
Devices specially constructed to possess capacitance
are called capacitors (or condensers, as they used to
be called). In its simplest form a capacitor consists of
two plates which are separated by an insulating material
known as a dielectric. A capacitor has the ability tostore
a quantity of static electricity.
The symbols for a ﬁxed capacitor and a variable
capacitor used in electrical circuit diagrams are shown
in Figure 8.5.

The charge Q stored in a capacitor is given by:
Q = I × t coulombs
where I is the current in amperes and t the time in
seconds.
Problem 1.
(a) Determine the p.d. across a 4μF
capacitor when charged with 5mC.
(b) Find the charge on a 50pF capacitor when the
voltage applied to it is 2kV.
(a)
C =4μF=4×10−6F;Q=5mC=5×10−3 C
Since C = Q
V then V = Q
C = 5×10−3
4×10−6 = 5×106

Hence p.d.=1250V or 1.25kV
(b)

Q = CV = 50 × 10−12 × 2000 = 5 × 2
108
= 0.1 × 10−6
Hence charge=0.1μC
Problem 2.
A direct current of 4 A ﬂows into a
previously uncharged 20μF capacitor for 3ms.
Determine the p.d. between the plates.
I = 4A;C = 20μF = 20 × 10−6F
t = 3ms = 3 × 10−3s
Q = It = 4 × 3 × 10−3C
V = Q
C = 4 × 3 × 10−3
20 × 10−6
= 12 × 106
20 × 103 = 0.6 × 103
=600V
Hence, the p.d. between the plates is 600 V
Problem 3.
A 5μF capacitor is charged so that
the p.d. between its plates is 800V. Calculate how
long the capacitor can provide an average discharge
current of 2mA.
C = 5μF = 5 × 10−6F;V = 800V;
I = 2mA = 2 × 10−3A
Q = CV = 5 × 10−6 × 800 = 4 × 10−3C
Also, Q=It. Thus, t = Q
I = 4×10−3
2×10−3 =2s
Hence the
capacitor can
provide an
average
discharge current of 2mA for 2s

8.6 Electric ﬂux density
Unit ﬂux is deﬁned as emanating from a positive charge
of 1 coulomb. Thus electric ﬂux 
 is measured in
coulombs, and for a charge of Q coulombs, the ﬂux

 =Q coulombs.
Electric ﬂux density D is the amount of ﬂux passing
through a deﬁned area A that is perpendicular to the
direction of the ﬂux:
electric ﬂux density, D = Q
A coulombs/metre2
Electric ﬂux density is also called charge density, σ
8.7 Permittivity
At any point in an electric ﬁeld, the electric ﬁeld strength
E maintains the electric ﬂux and produces a particular
value of electric ﬂux density D at that point. For a ﬁeld
established in vacuum (or for practical purposes in air),
the ratio D/E is a constant ε0, i.e.
D
E = ε0
where ε0 is called the permittivity of free space or the
free space constant. The valueof ε0 is 8.85×10−12 F/m.
When an insulating medium, such as mica, paper,
plastic or ceramic, is introduced into the region of an
electric ﬁeld the ratio of D/E is modiﬁed:
D
E = ε0εr
where εr, the relative permittivity of the insulating
material, indicates its insulating power compared with
that of vacuum:
relative permittivity εr = ﬂux density in material
ﬂux density in vacuum
εr has no unit. Typical values of εr include:
air, 1.00; polythene, 2.3; mica, 3–7; glass, 5–10;
water, 80; ceramics, 6–1000
The product ε0εr is called the absolute permittivity,
ε, i.e.
ε = ε0εr
The insulating medium separating charged surfaces is
called a dielectric. Compared with conductors, dielec-
tricmaterialshaveveryhighresistivities.Theyarethere-
fore used to separate conductors at different potentials,
such as capacitor plates or electric power lines.

is divided between the three capacitors. The capacitors
each store a charge and these are shown as Q1,Q2 and

QT = Q1 + Q2 + Q3
But QT =CV,Q1 =C1V,Q2 =C2V and Q3 =C3V .

C = C1 + C2 + C3 + ··· + Cn
i.e. the equivalent capacitance of a group of parallel-
connected capacitors is the sum of the capacitances
of the individual capacitors. (Note that this formula is
similar to that used for resistors connected in series.)
(b)
Capacitors connected in series
Figure 8.8 shows three capacitors, C1,C2 and C3, con-
nected in series across a supply voltage V . Let the
p.d. across the individual capacitors be V1,V2 and V3,
respectively, as shown.
Let the charge on plate ‘a’ of capacitor C1 be
+Q coulombs. This induces an equal but opposite
charge of −Q coulombs on plate ‘b’. The conductor
between plates ‘b’ and ‘c’ is electrically isolated from
the rest of the circuit so that an equal but opposite
chargeof+Qcoulombsmustappearonplate‘c’,which,
in turn, induces an equal and opposite charge of −Q
coulombs on plate ‘d’, and so on.
Hence when capacitors are connected in series the
charge on each is the same.

In practice, capacitors are rarely connected in series
unless they are of the same capacitance. The reason for
this can be seen from the above problem where the low-
estvaluedcapacitor(i.e. 3μF)hasthehighestp.d. across
it (i.e. 200V),which means that if all the capacitors have
an identical construction they must all be rated at the
highest voltage.

The charge on each of the capacitors shown in

Then
Q = C1V1 = C2V2
i.e.
5V1 = 15V2
V1 = 3V2
(1)
Also
V1 + V2 = 240V
Hence 3V2 + V2 = 240V from equation (1)
Thus
V2 = 60V and V1 = 180V
Hence the voltage across QR is 60V

8.12 Practical types of capacitor
Practical types of capacitor are characterized by the
materialusedfortheirdielectric.Themaintypesinclude:
variableair,mica,paper,ceramic,plastic,titaniumoxide
and electrolytic.
1.
Variable air capacitors. These usually consist of
two sets of metal plates (such as aluminium), one
ﬁxed, the other variable. The set of moving plates
rotate on a spindle as shown by the end view of
Figure 8.15.

As the moving plates are rotated through half a
revolution, the meshing, and therefore the capaci-
tance, varies from a minimum to a maximum value.
Variable air capacitors are used in radio and elec-
troniccircuitswhereverylowlossesarerequired,or
where a variable capacitance is needed. The maxi-
mum value of such capacitors is between 500pF
and 1000pF.
A typical practical variable air capacitor is shown
in Figure 8.16.
Figure 8.16
2.
Mica capacitors. A typical older type construction
is shown in Figure 8.17.
Mica sheets
Metal foil
(lead or aluminium)
Figure 8.17
Usually the whole capacitor is impregnated with
wax and placed in a bakelite case. Mica is easily
obtained in thin sheets and is a good insulator. How-
ever, mica is expensive and is not used in capacitors
aboveabout0.2μF.Amodiﬁedformofmicacapac-
itor is the silvered mica type. The mica is coated on
both sides with a thin layer of silver which forms
the plates. Capacitance is stable and less likely to
change with age. Such capacitors have a constant
capacitance with change of temperature, a high
working voltage rating and a long service life and
areusedinhigh-frequencycircuitswithﬁxedvalues
of capacitance up to about 1000pF.
3.
Paper capacitors. A typical paper capacitor is
shown in Figure 8.18 where the length of the roll
correspondsto the capacitance required. The whole
is usually impregnated with oil or wax to exclude
moisture, and then placed in a plastic or aluminium
container for protection. Paper capacitors are made
in various working voltages up to about 150kV
and are used where loss is not very important.
The maximum value of this type of capacitor is
between 500pF and 10μF. Disadvantages of paper
capacitors include variation in capacitance with
temperature change and a shorter service life than
most other types of capacitor.

Ceramic capacitors. These are made in various
forms, each type of construction depending on the
value of capacitance required. For high values, a
tube of ceramic material is used as shown in the
cross-section of Figure 8.19. For smaller values the
cup construction is used as shown in Figure 8.20,
and for still smaller values the disc construction
shown in Figure 8.21 is used. Certain ceramic mate-
rials have a very high permittivity and this enables
capacitors of high capacitance to be made which
are of small physical size with a high working volt-
age rating. Ceramic capacitors are available in the

Plastic capacitors. Some plastic materials such as
polystyrene and Teﬂon can be used as dielectrics.
Construction is similar to the paper capacitor
but using a plastic ﬁlm instead of paper. Plastic
capacitors operate well under conditions of high
temperature,provide a precise value of capacitance,
a very long service life and high reliability.
6.
Titanium oxide capacitors have a very high capa-
citance with a small physical size when used at a
low temperature.
7.
Electrolytic capacitors. Construction is similar to
thepapercapacitor,withaluminiumfoilusedforthe
plates and with a thick absorbent material, such as
paper, impregnatedwith an electrolyte (ammonium
borate), separating the plates. The ﬁnished capaci-
tor is usually assembled in an aluminium container
and hermetically sealed. Its operation depends on
the formation of a thin aluminiumoxide layer on the
positive plate by electrolytic action when a suitable
direct potential is maintained between the plates.
This oxide layer is very thin and forms the dielec-
tric. (The absorbent paper between the plates is a
conductor and does not act as a dielectric.) Such
capacitors must always be used on d.c. and must
be connected with the correct polarity; if this is not
done the capacitor will be destroyed since the oxide
layer will be destroyed. Electrolytic capacitors are
manufactured with working voltage from 6V to
600V,althoughaccuracy is generally not very high.
These capacitors possess a much larger capacitance
than other types of capacitors of similar dimensions
due to the oxide ﬁlm beingonlyafewmicrons thick.
The fact that they can be used only on d.c. supplies
limits their usefulness.
Some typical electrolytic capacitors are shown in
Figure 8.22.
Figure 8.22
8.13 Supercapacitors
Electrical double-layercapacitors (EDLC) are, together
with pseudocapacitors, part of a new type of electro-
chemical capacitor called supercapacitors, also known
as ultracapacitors. Supercapacitors do not have a con-
ventional solid dielectric. The capacitance value of an
electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage
principles:
(a)
Double-layercapacitanceistheelectrostaticstor-
age of the electrical energy achieved by separation
of charge in a Helmholtz double layer at the
interface between the surface of a conductor elec-
trode and an electrolytic solution electrolyte. The
separation of charge distance in a double-layer is
of the order of a few Angstroms (0.3–0.8 nm) and
is static in origin.

Part 2
Part 2
120
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(b)
Pseudocapacitance is the electrochemical storage
of the electrical energy, achieved by redox reac-
tions on the surface of the electrode or by specif-
ically adsorped ions that results in a reversible
faradaic charge-transfer on the electrode.
Double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance both
contribute to the total capacitance value of a superca-
pacitor.
Supercapacitors have the highest available capaci-
tance values per unit volume and the greatest energy
density of all capacitors. Supercapacitors support up
to 12000 F/1.2 V, with speciﬁc capacitance values
up to 10000 times that of electrolytic capacitors.
Supercapacitors bridge the gap between capacitors and
batteries. In terms of speciﬁc energy as well as in
terms of speciﬁc power this gap covers several orders
of magnitude. However, batteries still have about 10
times the capacity of supercapacitors. While exist-
ing supercapacitors have energy densities that are
approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their
power density is generally 10 to 100 times as great.
Power density combines energy density with the speed
at which the energy can be delivered to the load.
Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with
the correctpolarity.Polarity is controlledby design with
asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by
a voltage applied during manufacture.
Applications of supercapacitors
Applications of supercapacitors for power and energy
requirements include long, small currents for static
memory (SRAM) in electronic equipment, power
electronics that require very short, high currents as in
the KERS system in Formula 1 cars, and recovery of
braking energy in vehicles.
Advantages of supercapacitors include:
(i)
Long life, with little degradation over hundreds
of thousands of charge cycles. Due to the capac-
itor’s high number of charge–discharge cycles
(millions or more compared to 200 to 1000 for
most commercially available rechargeable bat-
teries) it will last for the entire lifetime of most
devices, which makes the device environmen-
tally friendly. Rechargeable batteries wear out
typically over a few years and their highly reac-
tive chemical electrolytes present a disposal and
safety hazard. Battery lifetime can be optimized
by charging only under favourable conditions,
at an ideal rate and, for some chemistries, as
infrequentlyaspossible.EDLCscanhelpincon-
junction with batteries by acting as a charge
conditioner, storing energy from other sources
for load balancing purposes and then using
any excess energy to charge the batteries at a
suitable time.
(ii)
Low cost per cycle.
(iii)
Good reversibility.
(iv)
Very high rates of charge and discharge.
(v)
Extremely low internal resistance (ESR) and
consequent high cycle efﬁciency (95% or more)
and extremely low heating levels.
(vi)
High output power.
(vii)
High speciﬁc power; the speciﬁc power of elec-
tric double-layer capacitors can exceed 6 kW/kg
at 95% efﬁciency.
(viii)
Improved safety, no corrosive electrolyte and
low toxicity of materials.
(ix)
Simple charge methods – no full-charge detec-
tion is needed; no danger of overcharging.
(x)
When used in conjunction with rechargeable
batteries, in some applications the EDLC can
supply energy for a short time, reducing battery
cycling duty and extending life.
Disadvantages of supercapacitors include:
(i)
The amount of energy stored per unit weight is
generally lower than that of an electrochemical
battery (3 to 5 Wh/kg for a standard ultracapaci-
tor, although 85 Wh/kg has been achieved in the
lab compared to 30 to 40 Wh/kg for a lead–acid
battery, 100 to 250 Wh/kg for a lithium-ion bat-
tery and about 0.1% of the volumetric energy
density of gasoline.
(ii)
Has the highest dielectric absorption of any type
of capacitor.
(iii)
High self-discharge – the rate is considerably
higher than that of an electrochemical battery.
(iv)
Low maximum voltage – series connections are
needed to obtain higher voltages and voltage
balancing may be required.
(v)
Unlike practical batteries, the voltage across any
capacitor, including EDLCs, drops signiﬁcantly
as it discharges. Effective storage and recovery of
energy requires complex electronic control and
switching equipment, with consequent energy
loss.

Capacitors and capacitance

(vi)
Very low internal resistance allows extremely
rapid discharge when shorted, resulting in a spark
hazard similar to any other capacitor of similar
voltage and capacitance (generally much higher
than electrochemical cells).
Summary
Ultracapacitorsaresomeofthebestdevicesavailablefor
delivering a quick surge of power. Because an ultraca-
pacitor stores energy in an electric ﬁeld, rather than in a
chemical reaction, it can survive hundreds of thousands
more charge and discharge cycles than a battery can.
8.14 Discharging capacitors
When a capacitor has been disconnected from the sup-
ply it may still be charged and it may retain this charge
for some considerable time. Thus precautions must be
taken to ensure that the capacitor is automatically dis-
charged after the supply is switched off. This is done
by connecting a high-value resistor across the capacitor
terminals.

Magnetic circuits
Why it is important to understand: Magnetic circuits
Many common devices rely on magnetism. Familiar examples include computer disk drives, tape
recorders, VCRs, transformers, motors, generators and so on. Practically all transformers and electric
machinery uses magnetic material for shaping and directing the magnetic ﬁelds which act as a medium
for transferring and connecting energy. It is therefore important to be able to analyse and describe mag-
netic ﬁeld quantities for understanding these devices. Magnetic materials are signiﬁcant in determining
the properties of a piece of electromagnetic equipment or an electric machine, and affect its size and
efﬁciency. To understand their operation, knowledge of magnetism and magnetic circuit principles is

9.1 Introduction to magnetism
and magnetic circuits
The study of magnetism began in the thirteenth century
with many eminent scientists and physicists such as
William Gilbert,∗Hans Christian Oersted∗, Michael
Faraday∗, James Maxwell∗, André Ampère∗and Wil-
helm Weber∗all having some input on the subject since.
The association between electricity and magnetism is a
fairly recent ﬁnding in comparison with the very ﬁrst
understanding of basic magnetism.
Today, magnets have many varied practical appli-
cations. For example, they are used in motors and
generators, telephones, relays, loudspeakers, computer
hard drives and ﬂoppy disks, anti-lock brakes, cam-
eras, ﬁshing reels, electronic ignition systems, key-
boards, TV and radio components and in transmission
equipment.
∗Who was Gilbert? William Gilbert (24 May 1544–30
November 1603) was an English physician, physicist and
natural philosopher who is credited as one of the orig-
inators of the term electricity. To ﬁnd out more go to

∗Who was Oersted? Hans Christian Oersted (14 August
1777–9 March 1851) was the Danish physicist and chemist who
discovered that electric currents create magnetic ﬁelds. To ﬁnd

5 November 1879) was a Scottish theoretical physicist who
formulated classical electromagnetic theory.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
The full theory of magnetism is one of the most com-
plex of subjects; this chapter provides an introduction
to the topic.
9.2 Magnetic ﬁelds
A permanent magnet is a piece of ferromagnetic
material (such as iron, nickel or cobalt) which has
properties of attracting other pieces of these materi-
als. A permanent magnet will position itself in a north
and south direction when freely suspended. The north-
seeking end of the magnet is called the north pole, N,
and the south-seeking end the south pole, S.
The area arounda magnet is called the magnetic ﬁeld
and it is in this area that the effects of themagnetic force
produced by the magnet can be detected. A magnetic
ﬁeld cannot be seen, felt, smelled or heard and there-
fore is difﬁcult to represent. Michael Faraday suggested
that the magnetic ﬁeld could be represented pictorially,
by imagining the ﬁeld to consist of lines of magnetic
ﬂux, which enables investigation of the distribution and
density of the ﬁeld to be carried out.
The distribution of a magnetic ﬁeld can be investi-
gated by using some iron ﬁlings. A bar magnet is placed
on a ﬂat surface covered by, say, cardboard, upon which
is sprinkled some iron ﬁlings. If the cardboard is gently
tapped the ﬁlings will assume a pattern similar to that
shown in Figure 9.1. If a number of magnets of different
strengthareused,itisfoundthatthestrongertheﬁeldthe
closer are the lines of magnetic ﬂuxand vice-versa. Thus
∗Who was Weber? Wilhelm Eduard Weber (24 October
1804–23 June 1891) was a German physicist who, together with
Gauss, invented the ﬁrst electromagnetic telegraph. To ﬁnd out
more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
Figure 9.1
a magnetic ﬁeld has the property of exerting a force,
demonstrated in this case by causing the iron ﬁlings to
move into the pattern shown. The strength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld decreases as we move away from the magnet.
It should be realized, of course, that the magnetic ﬁeld
is three dimensional in its effect, and not acting in one
plane as appears to be the case in this experiment.
If a compass is placed in the magnetic ﬁeld in various
positions, the direction of the lines of ﬂux may be deter-
mined by noting the direction of the compass pointer.
The direction of a magnetic ﬁeld at any point is taken as
that in which the north-seeking pole of a compass needle
points when suspended in the ﬁeld. The direction of a
line of ﬂux is from the north pole to the south pole on
the outside of the magnet and is then assumed to con-
tinue through the magnet back to the point at which it
emerged at the north pole. Thus such lines of ﬂux always
form complete closed loops or paths, they never inter-
sect and always have a deﬁnite direction. The laws of
magnetic attraction and repulsion can be demonstrated
by using two bar magnets. In Figure 9.2(a), with unlike
polesadjacent,attractiontakesplace.Linesofﬂuxare

imaginedtocontractandthemagnetstrytopulltogether.
The magnetic ﬁeld is strongest in between the two mag-
nets, shown by the lines of ﬂux being close together.
In Figure 9.2(b), with similar poles adjacent (i.e. two
north poles), repulsion occurs, i.e. the two north poles
try to push each other apart, since magnetic ﬂux lines
running side by side in the same direction repel.
9.3 Magnetic ﬂux and ﬂux density
Magnetic ﬂux is the amount of magnetic ﬁeld (or the
numberoflinesofforce)producedbyamagneticsource.
The symbol for magnetic ﬂux is  (Greek letter ‘phi’).
The unit of magnetic ﬂux is the weber,∗Wb.
Magnetic ﬂux density is the amount of ﬂux passing
through a deﬁned area that is perpendicular to the
direction of the ﬂux:
Magnetic ﬂux density= magnetic ﬂux
area
The symbol for magnetic ﬂux density is B. The
unit of magnetic ﬂux density is the tesla,∗T, where
1T= 1Wb/m2. Hence
B= 
A tesla
where A(m2) is the area
Problem 1.
A magnetic pole face has a
rectangular section having dimensions 200mm by
100mm. If the total ﬂux emerging from the pole is
150μWb, calculate the ﬂux density.
Flux  = 150μWb = 150×10−6 Wb
Cross-sectional area A=200×100 = 20000mm2
= 20000×10−6 m2
Flux density B = 
A =
150 × 10−6
20000× 10−6
= 0.0075 T or 7.5 mT
Problem 2.
The maximum working ﬂux density
of a lifting electromagnet is 1.8 T and the effective
area of a pole face is circular in cross-section. If the
total magnetic ﬂux produced is 353mWb,
determine the radius of the pole face.
∗Who was Weber? For image and resume of Weber, see page
124. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
Flux density B = 1.8T;
ﬂux  = 353mWb = 353×10−3 Wb
Since B = 
A,cross-sectional area A = 
B
= 353 × 10−3

m2
= 0.1961m2
The pole face is circular, hence area= πr 2, where r is
the radius.
Hence πr2 = 0.1961
from which r2 = 0.1961
π
and radius r =
0.1961
π

= 0.250m
i.e. the radius of the pole face is 250mm
9.4 Magnetomotive force and
magnetic ﬁeld strength
Magnetomotive force (mmf) is the cause of the exis-
tence of a magnetic ﬂux in a magnetic circuit,
mmf,Fm =NI amperes
∗Who was Tesla? Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856–7 January 1943),
after emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas
Edison, set up a number of laboratories and companies to
develop a range of electrical devices. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird

Part 2

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
where N is the number of conductors (or turns) and I is
the current in amperes. The unit of mmf is sometimes
expressed as ‘ampere-turns’. However, since ‘turns’
have no dimensions, the SI unit of mmf is the ampere.
Magnetic ﬁeld strength (or magnetizing force),
H = NI/l ampere per metre
where l is the mean length of the ﬂux path in metres.
Thus mmf =NI = Hl amperes.
Problem 3.
A magnetizing force of 8000A/m is
applied to a circular magnetic circuit of mean
diameter 30cm by passing a current through a coil
wound on the circuit. If the coil is uniformly wound
around the circuit and has 750 turns, ﬁnd the
current in the coil.
H = 8000A/m; l = πd = π ×30×10−2 m;
N = 750 turns
Since H=NI
l then, I = Hl
N = 8000 × π × 30 × 10−2
750
Thus, current I =10.05 A

The maximum working ﬂux density of a lifting
electromagnet is 1.9T and the effective area
of a pole face is circular in cross-section. If
the total magnetic ﬂux produced is 611mWb,
determine the radius of the pole face.

A current of 5A is passed through a 1000-turn
coil wound on a circular magnetic circuit
of radius 120mm. Calculate (a) the magne-
tomotive force, and (b) the magnetic ﬁeld
strength.
9.5 Permeability and B–H curves
For air, or any non-magnetic medium, the ratio of mag-
netic ﬂux density to magnetizing force is a constant,
i.e. B/H = a constant. This constant is μ0, the perme-
ability of free space (or the magnetic space constant)
and is equal to 4π ×10−7 H/m, i.e. for air, or any
non-magnetic medium, the ratio B/H =μ0. (Although
all non-magnetic materials, including air, exhibit slight
magnetic properties,these can effectivelybe neglected.)
For all media other than free space, B/H =μ0μr
where ur is the relative permeability, and is deﬁned as
μr = ﬂux density in material
ﬂux density in a vacuum
μr varies with the type of magnetic material and, since
it is a ratio of ﬂux densities, it has no unit. From its
deﬁnition, μr for a vacuum is 1.
μ0μr =μ, called the absolute permeability.
By plotting measured values of ﬂux density B against
magnetic ﬁeld strength H, a magnetization curve (or
B–H curve) is produced. For non-magnetic materials
this is a straight line. Typical curves for four magnetic
materials are shown in Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3 B–H curves for four materials

The relative permeability of a ferromagnetic mat-
erial is proportional to the slope of the B–H curve and
thus varies with the magneticﬁeld strength.The approx-
imate range of values of relative permeability μr for
some common magnetic materials are:
Cast iron
μr = 100–250
Mild steel μr = 200–800
Silicon iron μr = 1000–5000
Cast steel
μr = 300–900

A coil of 300 turns is wound
uniformly on a ring of non-magnetic material. The
ring has a mean circumference of 40cm and a
uniform cross-sectional area of 4cm2. If the current

strength, (b) the ﬂux density and (c) the total
magnetic ﬂux in the ring.

is uniformly wound with 2000 turns of wire. When
a current of 0.25 A is passed through the coil a ﬂux
density of 0.4 T is set up in the iron. Find (a) the
magnetizing force and (b) the relative permeability
of the iron under these conditions.
l = πd = π×10cm = π×10×10−2 m;
N =2000 turns; I = 0.25 A; B = 0.4 T

H = NI
l =

Problem 8.
A uniform ring of cast iron has a
cross-sectional area of 10cm2 and a mean
circumference of 20cm. Determine the mmf
necessary to produce a ﬂux of 0.3mWb in the ring.
The magnetization curve for cast iron is shown in
Figure 9.3.
A = 10 cm2 = 10×10−4m2;l = 20 cm = 0.2 m;
 = 0.3×10−3 Wb
Flux density B = 
A = 0.3 × 10−3
10 × 10−4 = 0.3T
From the magnetization curve for cast iron in Figure 9.3,
when B = 0.3 T, H = 1000A/m, hence
mmf= Hl = 1000×0.2 = 200 A
A tabular method could have been used in this problem.
Such a solution is shown at the bottom of page 128.

For a series magnetic circuit having n parts, the total
reluctance S is given by:
S=S1 +S2 +··· +Sn
(This is similar to resistors connected in series in an
electrical circuit.)

ﬂows. Determine the ﬂux density in the 2cm path,
if the relative permeability of the cast steel is 750.

of each part.
For the silicon iron: B = 
A = 0.7 × 10−3
5 × 10−4 = 1.4T
From the B–H curve for silicon iron on page 126, when
B =1.4 T, H =1650At/m.
Hence the mmf for the iron path= Hl = 1650×0.4

For the air gap:
The ﬂux density will be the same in the air gap as in

9.9 Hysteresis and hysteresis loss
Hysteresis loop
Let a ferromagnetic material which is completely
demagnetized, i.e. one in which B = H = 0 be sub-
jected to increasing values of magnetic ﬁeld strength
H and the corresponding ﬂux density B measured. The
resulting relationship between B and H is shown by the
curve Oab in Figure 9.8. At a particular value of H,
shown as Oy, it becomes difﬁcult to increase the ﬂux
density any further. The material is said to be saturated.
Thus by is the saturation ﬂux density.
Figure 9.8
If the value of H is now reduced it is found that the ﬂux
density follows curve bc. When H is reduced to zero,
ﬂux remains in the iron. This remanent ﬂux density
Figure 9.9
or remanence is shown as Oc in Figure 9.8. When H
is increased in the opposite direction, the ﬂux density
decreases until, at a value shown as Od, the ﬂux density
has been reduced to zero. Themagneticﬁeld strengthOd
required to remove the residual magnetism, i.e. reduce
B to zero, is called the coercive force.
Further increase of H in the reverse direction causes
the ﬂux density to increase in the reverse direction until
saturation is reached, as shown by curve de. If H is var-
ied backwards from Ox to Oy, the ﬂux density follows
the curve efgb, similar to curve bcde.
It is seen fromFigure 9.8 that the ﬂux density changes
lag behind the changes in the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
This effect is called hysteresis. The closed ﬁgure
bcdefgb is called the hysteresis loop (or the B/H loop).
Hysteresis loss
A disturbance in the alignment of the domains (i.e.
groups of atoms) of a ferromagnetic material causes
energy to be expended in taking it through a cycle
of magnetization. This energy appears as heat in the
specimen and is called the hysteresis loss.
The energy loss associated with hysteresis is propor-
tional to the area of the hysteresis loop.
The area of a hysteresis loop varies with the type of
material. The area, and thus the energy loss, is much
greater for hard materials than for soft materials.

Part 2
Magnetic circuits
133
Figure 9.9 shows typical hysteresis loops for:
(a)
hard material, which has a high remanence Oc
and a large coercivity Od
(b)
soft steel, which has a large remanence and small
coercivity
(c)
ferrite, this being a ceramic-like magnetic sub-
stance made from oxides of iron, nickel, cobalt,
magnesium, aluminium and mangenese; the hys-
teresis of ferrite is very small.
For a.c.-excited devices the hysteresis loop is repeated
every cycle of alternating current. Thus a hysteresis loop
with a large area (as with hard steel) is often unsuitable
since the energy loss would be considerable. Silicon
steel has a narrow hysteresis loop, and thus small hys-
teresis loss, and is suitable for transformer cores and
rotating machine armatures.

Chapter 10
Electromagnetism
Why it is important to understand: Electromagnetism
While the basic facts about magnetism have been known since ancient times, it was not until the early
1800s that the connection between electricity and magnetism was made and the foundations of modern
electromagnetic theory established. In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish scientist, demonstrated
that electricity and magnetism were related when he showed that a compass needle was deﬂected by a
current-carryingconductor. The following year, Andre Ampère showed that current-carryingconductors
attract or repel each other just like magnets. However, it was Michael Faraday who developed our present
concept of the magnetic ﬁeld as a collection of ﬂux lines in space that conceptually represent both the
intensity and the direction of the ﬁeld. It was this concept that led to an understanding of magnetism and
the development of important practical devices such as the transformer and the electric generator. In
electrical machines, ferromagnetic materials may form the magnetic circuits (as in transformers), or by
ferromagneticmaterials in conjunction with air (as in rotatingmachines). In most electrical machines, the
magnetic ﬁeld is produced by passing an electric current through coils wound on ferromagnetic material.
In this chapter important concepts of electromagnetism are explained and simple calculations performed.

understand that magnetic ﬁelds are produced by electric currents

10.1 Magnetic ﬁeld due to an electric
current
Magnetic ﬁelds can be set up not only by permanent
magnets, as shown in Chapter 9, but also by electric
currents.
Let a piece of wire be arranged to pass vertically
through a horizontal sheet of cardboard, on which is
placed some iron ﬁlings, as shown in Figure 10.1(a).
(b)
(a)
Iron filings
Sheet of

Wire

direction
Figure 10.1
If a current is now passed through the wire, then the
iron ﬁlings will form a deﬁnite circular ﬁeld pattern
with the wire at the centre when the cardboard is gen-
tly tapped. By placing a compass in different positions
the lines of ﬂux are seen to have a deﬁnite direction,
as shown in Figure 10.1(b). If the current direction
is reversed, the direction of the lines of ﬂux is also
reversed. The effect on both the iron ﬁlings and the
compass needle disappears when the current is switched
off. The magnetic ﬁeld is thus produced by the electric
current. The magnetic ﬂux produced has the same prop-
erties as the ﬂux produced by a permanent magnet. If
the currentis increasedthe strengthof the ﬁeld increases
and, as for the permanent magnet, the ﬁeld strength
decreases as we move away from the current-carrying
conductor.
In Figure 10.1 the effect of only a small part of the
magnetic ﬁeld is shown.
If the whole length of the conductor is similarly investi-
gated it is found that the magnetic ﬁeld around a straight
conductorisintheformofconcentriccylindersasshown

direction of the current ﬂow.

Figure 10.2
When dealing with magnetic ﬁelds formed by electric
current it is usual to portray the effect as shown in
Figure 10.3. The convention adopted is:
(i)
Current ﬂowing away from the viewer, i.e. into
the paper, is indicated by ⊕. This may be thought
of as the feathered end of the shaft of an arrow.
See Figure 10.3(a).
(ii)
Current ﬂowing towards the viewer, i.e. out of the
paper, is indicated by ⊙. This may be thought of
as the tip of an arrow. See Figure 10.3(b).
The direction of the magnetic lines of ﬂux is best
remembered by the screw rule. This states that:
‘If a normal right-hand thread screw is screwed along
the conductor in the direction of the current, the
direction of rotation of the screw is in the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld.’
For example, with current ﬂowing away from the
viewer (Figure10.3(a))a right-handthread screw driven
into the paper has to be rotated clockwise. Hence the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is clockwise.
A magnetic ﬁeld set up by a long coil, or solenoid, is
shown in Figure 10.4(a) and is seen to be similar to that
of a bar magnet. If the solenoid is wound on an iron bar,
as shown in Figure 10.4(b), an even stronger magnetic
ﬁeld is produced, the iron becoming magnetized and
behaving like a permanent magnet.

Figure 10.4
The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
current I in the solenoid may be found by either of two
methods, i.e. the screw rule or the grip rule.
(a)
The screw rule states that if a normal right-
hand thread screw is placed along the axis of the
solenoid and is screwed in the direction of the cur-
rent it moves in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
inside the solenoid. The direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld inside the solenoid is from south to north.
Thus in Figures 10.4(a) and (b) the north pole is
to the right.
(b)
The grip rule states that if the coil is gripped
with the right hand, with the ﬁngers pointing in
the direction of the current, then the thumb, out-
stretched parallel to the axis of the solenoid,points
in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the
solenoid.
Problem 1.
Figure 10.5 shows a coil of wire
wound on an iron core connected to a battery.
Sketch the magnetic ﬁeld pattern associated with
the current-carrying coil and determine the polarity
of the ﬁeld.
Figure 10.5
The magnetic ﬁeld associated with the solenoid in
Figure 10.5 is similar to the ﬁeld associated with a bar
magnet and is as shown in Figure 10.6. The polarity of
the ﬁeld is determined either by the screw rule or by the
grip rule. Thus the north pole is at the bottom and the
south pole at the top.

10.2 Electromagnets
The solenoid is very important in electromagnetic the-
ory since the magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid is
practically uniform for a particular current, and is
also versatile, inasmuch that a variation of the current
can alter the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. An elec-
tromagnet, based on the solenoid, provides the basis
of many items of electrical equipment, examples of
which include electric bells, relays, lifting magnets and
telephone receivers.
(i)
Electric bell
There are various types of electric bell, including the
single-stroke bell, the trembler bell, the buzzer and
a continuously ringing bell, but all depend on the
attraction exerted by an electromagnet on a soft iron

armature. A typical single-stroke bell circuit is shown
in Figure 10.7. When the push button is operated a
current passes through the coil. Since the iron-cored
coil is energized the soft iron armature is attracted
to the electromagnet. The armature also carries a
striker which hits the gong. When the circuit is bro-
ken the coil becomes demagnetized and the spring
steel strip pulls the armature back to its original posi-
tion. The striker will only operate when the push is
operated.

tacts are opened or closed by operation instead of a
gong being struck. A typical simple relay is shown
in Figure 10.8, which consists of a coil wound on a
soft iron core. When the coil is energized the hinged
soft iron armature is attracted to the electromagnet
and pushes against two ﬁxed contacts so that they are

are used in iron and steel works for lifting scrap metal.
A typical robust lifting magnet, capable of exerting
large attractive forces, is shown in the elevation and
plan view of Figure 10.9, where a coil, C, is wound
round a central core, P, of the iron casting. Over the
face of the electromagnet is placed a protective non-
magnetic sheet of material, R. The load, Q, which

Telephone receiver
Whereas a transmitter or microphone changes sound
waves into corresponding electrical signals, a tele-
phone receiver converts the electrical waves back into
sound waves. A typical telephone receiver is shown in
Figure 10.10 and consists of a permanent magnet with
coils wound on its poles. A thin, ﬂexible diaphragm
of magnetic material is held in position near to the
magnetic poles but not touching them. Variation in
current from the transmitter varies the magnetic ﬁeld
and the diaphragm consequently vibrates. The vibra-
tion produces sound variations corresponding to those
transmitted.

10.3 Force on a current-carrying
conductor
If a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic
ﬁeld produced by permanent magnets, then the ﬁelds
due to the current-carrying conductor and the permanent
magnets interact and cause a force to be exerted on the
conductor. The force on the current-carrying conductor
in a magnetic ﬁeld depends upon:
(a)
the ﬂux density of the ﬁeld, B teslas
(b)
the strength of the current, I amperes
(c)
the length of the conductor perpendicular to
the magnetic ﬁeld, l metres, and
(d)
the directions of the ﬁeld and the current.
When the magnetic ﬁeld, the current and the conductor
are mutually at right-angles, then:
Force F = BIl newtons
When the conductor and the ﬁeld are at an angle θ ◦to
each other then:
Force F = BIl sin θ newtons
Since when the magnetic ﬁeld, current and conduc-
tor are mutually at right angles, F = BIl, the magnetic
ﬂux density B may be deﬁned by B = F/Il, i.e. the
ﬂux density is 1T if the force exerted on 1m of a
conductor when the conductor carries a current of 1A
is 1N.
Loudspeaker
A simple application of the above force is the moving-
coil loudspeaker. The loudspeaker is used to convert
electrical signals into sound waves.

Figure 10.11
Figure 10.11 shows a typical loudspeaker having a
magnetic circuit comprising a permanent magnet and
soft iron pole pieces so that a strong magnetic ﬁeld
is available in the short cylindrical air gap. A mov-
ing coil, called the voice or speech coil, is suspended
from the end of a paper or plastic cone so that it lies
in the gap. When an electric current ﬂows through
the coil it produces a force which tends to move the
cone backwards and forwards according to the direc-
tion of the current. The cone acts as a piston, transferring
this force to the air, and producing the required sound
waves.
Problem 2.
A conductor carries a current of 20A
and is at right-angles to a magnetic ﬁeld having a
ﬂux density of 0.9T. If the length of the conductor
in the ﬁeld is 30cm, calculate the force acting on
the conductor. Determine also the value of the force
if the conductor is inclined at an angle of 30◦to the
direction of the ﬁeld.
B = 0.9T; I = 20A; l = 30cm = 0.30m
Force F = BIl = (0.9)(20)(0.30) newtons when the
conductor is at right-angles to the ﬁeld, as shown in
Figure 10.12(a), i.e. F=5.4N

i.e.
F =2.7N
If
the
current-carrying
conductor
shown
in
Figure 10.3(a) is placed in the magnetic ﬁeld shown in
Figure 10.13(a), then the two ﬁelds interact and cause
a force to be exerted on the conductor as shown in
Figure 10.13(b). The ﬁeld is strengthened above the
conductor and weakened below, thus tending to move
the conductor downwards. This is the basic principle of
operation of the electric motor (see Section 10.4) and
the moving-coil instrument (see Section 10.5).
The direction of the force exerted on a conductor can
be pre-determined by using Fleming’s∗left-hand rule
(often called the motor rule), which states:
Let the thumb, ﬁrst ﬁnger and second ﬁnger of the left
hand be extended such that they are all at right-angles
to each other (as shown in Figure 10.14). If the ﬁrst
ﬁnger points in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, the
second ﬁnger points in the direction of the current, then
the thumb will point in the direction of the motion of the
conductor.
∗Who was Fleming? Sir John Ambrose Fleming (29 Novem-
ber 1849–18 April 1945) was the English electrical engineer and

Problem 3.
Determine the current required in a
400mm length of conductor of an electric motor,
when the conductor is situated at right-angles to a
magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux density 1.2T, if a force of
1.92N is to be exerted on the conductor. If the
conductor is vertical, the current ﬂowing
downwards and the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
is from left to right, what is the direction of the
force?
Force = 1.92N; l = 400mm = 0.40m; B = 1.2T
Since F = BIl, then I = F
Bl
hence current I =
1.92
(1.2)(0.4) = 4A

Part 2
Electromagnetism
141
If the current ﬂows downwards, the direction of its mag-
netic ﬁeld due to the current alone will be clockwise
when viewed from above. The lines of ﬂux will rein-
force (i.e. strengthen) the main magnetic ﬁeld at the
back of the conductor and will be in opposition in the
front (i.e. weaken the ﬁeld).
Hence the force on the conductor will be from back
to front (i.e. towards the viewer). This direction
may also have been deduced using Fleming’s left-hand
rule.
Problem 4.
A conductor 350mm long carries a
current of 10A and is at right-angles to a magnetic
ﬁeld lying between two circular pole faces each of
radius 60mm. If the total ﬂux between the pole
faces is 0.5mWb, calculate the magnitude of the
force exerted on the conductor.
l = 350mm = 0.35m; I = 10A;
Area of pole face A = πr 2 = π(0.06)2m2;

ﬁeld as shown in Figure 10.16(a), the direc-

(a)

10.4 Principle of operation of a simple
d.c. motor
A rectangular coil which is free to rotate about a ﬁxed
axis is shown placed inside a magnetic ﬁeld produced
by permanent magnets in Figure 10.17. A direct current
is fed into the coil via carbon brushes bearing on a com-
mutator, which consists of a metal ring split into two
halves separated by insulation.
When current ﬂows in the coil a magnetic ﬁeld is set
up around the coil which interacts with the magnetic
ﬁeld produced by the magnets. This causes a force F to
be exerted on the current-carrying conductor which, by
Fleming’s left-hand rule, is downwards between points
A and B and upward between C and D for the current
directionshown.Thiscausesatorqueandthecoilrotates
anticlockwise. When the coil has turned through 90◦
from the position shown in Figure 10.17 the brushes
connected to the positive and negative terminals of the
supply make contact with different halves of the com-
mutator ring, thus reversing the direction of the current
ﬂow in the conductor. If the current is not reversed and
the coil rotates past this position the forces acting on it

change direction and it rotates in the opposite direction,
thus never making more than half a revolution. The
current direction is reversed every time the coil swings
through the vertical position and thus the coil rotates
anticlockwise for as long as the current ﬂows. This is
the principle of operation of a d.c. motor which is thus
a device that takes in electrical energy and converts it
into mechanical energy.
10.5 Principle of operation
of a moving-coil instrument
A moving-coil instrument operates on the motor prin-
ciple. When a conductor carrying current is placed in a
magnetic ﬁeld, a force F is exerted on the conductor,
given by F=BIl. If the ﬂux density B is made constant
(by using permanent magnets) and the conductor is a
ﬁxed length (say, a coil) then the force will depend only
on the current ﬂowing in the conductor.
In a moving-coil instrument a coil is placed centrally
in the gap between shaped pole pieces as shown by the
front elevation in Figure 10.18(a). (The air gap is kept
as small as possible, although for clarity it is shown
exaggerated in Figure 10.18.) The coil is supported by
steel pivots, resting in jewel bearings, on a cylindrical
iron core. Current is led into and out of the coil by two
phosphor bronze spiral hairsprings which are wound in
opposite directions to minimize the effect of tempera-
ture change and to limit the coil swing (i.e. to control
the movement) and return the movement to zero posi-
tion when no current ﬂows. Current ﬂowing in the coil
produces forces as shown in Figure 10.18(b), the direc-
tions being obtained by Fleming’s left-hand rule. The
two forces, FA and FB, produce a torque which will
move the coil in a clockwise direction, i.e. move the

pointer from left to right. Since force is proportional to
current the scale is linear.
When the aluminium frame, on which the coil is
wound, is rotated between the poles of the magnet,
small currents (called eddy currents) are induced into
the frame, and this provides automatically the necessary
damping of the system due to the reluctance of the for-
mer to move within the magnetic ﬁeld. The moving-coil
instrument will measure only direct current or voltage
and the terminals are marked positive and negative to
ensure that the current passes through the coil in the
correct direction to deﬂect the pointer ‘up the scale’.
The range of this sensitive instrument is extended by
using shunts and multipliers (see Chapter 12).
10.6 Force on a charge
When a charge of Q coulombs is moving at a velocity

Electromagnetic induction
Why it is important to understand: Electromagnetic induction
Electromagnetic induction is the production of a potential difference (voltage) across a conductor when
it is exposed to a varying magnetic ﬁeld. Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of
induction in the 1830s. Faraday’s law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism that predicts
how a magnetic ﬁeld will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (e.m.f.). It
is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors and many types of electrical motors,
generatorsandsolenoids.A.c.generatorsuseFaraday’slawtoproducerotationandthusconvertelectrical
and magnetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. This idea can be used to run all kinds of motors.
Probably one of the greatest inventions of all time is the transformer. Alternating current from the
primary coil moves quickly back and forth across the secondary coil. The moving magnetic ﬁeld caused
by the changing ﬁeld (ﬂux) induces a current in the secondary coil. This chapter explains electromagnetic
induction, Faraday’s laws, Lenz’s law and Fleming’s rule and develops various calculations to help
understanding of the concepts.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•

11.1 Introduction to electromagnetic
induction
When a conductor is moved across a magnetic ﬁeld so
as to cut through the lines of force (or ﬂux), an elec-
tromotive force (e.m.f.) is produced in the conductor.
If the conductor forms part of a closed circuit then
the e.m.f. produced causes an electric current to ﬂow
round the circuit. Hence an e.m.f. (and thus current) is
‘induced’ in the conductor as a result of its movement
across the magnetic ﬁeld. This effect is known as
‘electromagnetic induction’.
Figure 11.1(a) shows a coil of wire connected to a
centre-zero galvanometer, which is a sensitive ammeter
with the zero-current position in the centre of the scale.

(a)
When the magnet is moved at constant speed
towards the coil (Figure 11.1(a)), a deﬂection is
noted on the galvanometer showing that a current
has been produced in the coil.
(b)
When the magnet is moved at the same speed as
in (a) but away from the coil the same deﬂec-
tion is noted but is in the opposite direction (see
Figure 11.1(b)).
(c)
When the magnet is held stationary, even within
the coil, no deﬂection is recorded.
(d)
When the coil is moved at the same speed as
in (a) and the magnet held stationary the same
galvanometer deﬂection is noted.
(e)
When the relative speed is, say, doubled, the
galvanometer deﬂection is doubled.
(f)
When a stronger magnet is used, a greater gal-
vanometer deﬂection is noted.
(g)
When the number of turns of wire of the coil
is increased, a greater galvanometer deﬂection is
noted.
Figure 11.1(c) shows the magnetic ﬁeld associated
with the magnet. As the magnet is moved towards the
coil, the magnetic ﬂux of the magnet moves across, or
cuts, the coil. It is the relative movement of the mag-
netic ﬂux and the coil that causes an e.m.f., and
thus current, to be induced in the coil. This effect is
known as electromagnetic induction. The laws of elec-
tromagnetic induction stated in Section 11.2 evolved
from experiments such as those described above.

11.2 Laws of electromagnetic
induction
Faraday’s∗laws of electromagnetic induction state:
(i)
An induced e.m.f. is set up whenever the magnetic
ﬁeld linking that circuit changes.
(ii)
The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. in any cir-
cuit is proportional to the rate of change of the
magnetic ﬂux linking the circuit.
Lenz’s∗law states:
The direction of an induced e.m.f. is always such that
it tends to set up a current opposing the motion or the
change of ﬂux responsible for inducing that e.m.f.
An alternative method to Lenz’s law of determin-
ing relative directions is given by Fleming’s∗Right-
hand rule (often called the geneRator rule) which
states:
∗Who was Lenz? Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz (12 February
1804–10 February 1865) was the Russian physicist remembered
for formulating Lenz’s law in electrodynamics. To ﬁnd out more

Summarizing:
First ﬁnger – Field
ThuMb – Motion
SEcond ﬁnger – E.m.f.
In a generator, conductors forming an electric circuit
are made to move through a magnetic ﬁeld. By Fara-
day’s law an e.m.f. is induced in the conductors and
thus a source of e.m.f. is created. A generator converts
mechanical energy into electrical energy. (The action
of a simple a.c. generator is described in Chapter 16.)
The induced e.m.f. E set up between the ends of the
conductor shown in Figure 11.3 is given by:
E=Blv volts
where B, the ﬂux density, is measured in teslas, l, the
length of conductor in the magnetic ﬁeld, is measured
in metres, and v, the conductor velocity, is measured in
metres per second.

11.4 Inductance
Inductance is the name given to the property of a cir-
cuit whereby there is an e.m.f. induced into the circuit
by the change of ﬂux linkages produced by a current
change.
When the e.m.f. is induced in the same circuit as that
in which the current is changing, the property is called
self inductance, L.
When the e.m.f. is induced in a circuit by a change of
ﬂux due to current changing in an adjacent circuit, the
property is called mutual inductance, M.
The unit of inductance is the henry,∗H.
A circuit has an inductance of one henry when an e.m.f.
of one volt is induced in it by a current changing at the

11.5 Inductors
A component called an inductor is used when the prop-
erty of inductance is required in a circuit. The basic form
of an inductor is simply a coil of wire.
Factors which affect the inductance of an inductor
include:
(i)
the number of turns of wire – the more turns the
higher the inductance
(ii)
the cross-sectional area of the coil of wire – the
greater the cross-sectional area the higher the
inductance
(iii)
the presence of a magnetic core – when the coil
is wound on an iron core the same current sets
up a more concentrated magnetic ﬁeld and the
inductance is increased
(iv)
the way the turns are arranged – a short, thick coil
of wire has a higher inductance than a long, thin
one.
Two examples of practical inductors are shown in
Figure 11.7, and the standard electrical circuit dia-
gram symbols for air-cored and iron-coredinductors are
shown in Figure 11.8.
An iron-cored inductor is often called a choke since,
when used in a.c. circuits, it has a choking effect,
limiting the current ﬂowing through it. Inductance is

often undesirable in a circuit. To reduce inductance to
a minimum the wire may be bent back on itself, as
shown in Figure 11.9, so that the magnetizing effect
of one conductor is neutralized by that of the adja-
cent conductor. The wire may be coiled around an
insulator, as shown, without increasing the inductance.
Standardresistors maybe non-inductivelywoundin this
manner.

Why it is important to understand: Electrical measuring instruments and measurements
Future electrical engineers need to be able to appreciate basic measurement techniques, instruments
and methods used in everyday practice. This chapter covers both analogue and digital instruments,
measurement errors, bridges, oscilloscopes, data acquisition, instrument controls and measurement
systems. Accurate measurements are central to virtually every scientiﬁc and engineering discipline.
Electrical measurements often come down to either measuring current or measuring voltage. Even if
you are measuring frequency, you will be measuring the frequency of a current signal or a voltage signal
and you will need to know how to measure either voltage or current. Many times you will use a digital
multimeter – a DMM – to measure either voltage or current; actually, a DMM will also usually measure
frequency (of a voltage signal) and resistance. The quality of a measuring instrument is assessed from
its accuracy, precision, reliability, durability and so on, all of which are related to its cost.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
recognize the importance of testing and measurements in electric circuits
•
appreciate the essential devices comprising an analogue instrument
•
calculate values of shunts for ammeters and multipliers for voltmeters
•

12.1 Introduction
Tests and measurements are important in designing,
evaluating, maintaining and servicing electrical circuits
and equipment. In order to detect electrical quantities
such as current, voltage, resistance or power, it is neces-
sary to transform an electrical quantity or condition into
a visible indication. This is done with the aid of instru-
ments (or meters) that indicate the magnitude of quan-
tities either by the position of a pointer moving over a
graduated scale (called an analogue instrument) or in the
form of a decimal number (called a digital instrument).
The digital instrument has, in the main, become
the instrument of choice in recent years; in particular,
computer-based instruments are rapidly replacing items
of conventional test equipment, with the virtual storage
test instrument, the digital storage oscilloscope, being
the most common.This is explainedlater in this chapter,
but before that some analogue instruments, which are
still used in some installations, are explored.
12.2 Analogue instruments
All analogue electrical indicating instruments require
three essential devices:
(a)
A deﬂecting or operating device. A mechanical
force is produced by the current or voltage which
causes the pointer to deﬂect from its zero position.
(b)
A controlling device. The controlling force acts
in opposition to the deﬂecting force and ensures
that the deﬂection shown on the meter is always
the same for a given measured quantity. It also
prevents the pointer always going to the maximum
deﬂection. Thereare two main types of controlling
device – spring control and gravity control.
(c)
A damping device. The damping force ensures
that the pointer comes to rest in its ﬁnal position
quickly and without undue oscillation. There are
three main types of damping used – eddy-current
damping, air-friction damping and ﬂuid-friction
damping.
There are basically two types of scale – linear and non-
linear.
A linear scale is shown in Figure 12.1(a), where
the divisions or graduations are evenly spaced. The
voltmeter shown has a range 0–100V, i.e. a full-scale
deﬂection (f.s.d.) of 100V. A non-linear scale is shown
in Figure 12.1(b). The scale is cramped at the beginning
and the graduations are uneven throughout the range.
The ammeter shown has a f.s.d. of 10A.
Figure 12.1
12.3 Shunts and multipliers
An ammeter, which measures current, has a low resist-
ance (ideally zero) and must be connected in series with
the circuit.
A voltmeter, which measures p.d., has a high resistance
(ideally inﬁnite) and must be connected in parallel with
the part of the circuit whose p.d. is required.

Part 2
160
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
There is no difference between the basic instrument
used to measure current and voltage since both use
a milliammeter as their basic part. This is a sensitive
instrument which gives f.s.d. for currents of only a few
milliamperes. When an ammeter is required to measure
currents of larger magnitude, a proportionof the current
is diverted through a low-value resistance connected in
parallel with the meter. Such a diverting resistor is called
a shunt.
From Figure 12.2(a), VPQ = VRS. Hence Iara = ISRS
Thus the value of the shunt,
Rs = I ara
I s
ohms
The milliammeter is converted into a voltmeter by con-
necting a high-value resistance (called a multiplier)
in series with it, as shown in Figure 12.2(b). From
Figure 12.2(b), V = Va + VM =Ira +IRM
Thus the value of the multiplier, RM =V −Ira
I
ohms
Figure 12.2
Problem 1.
A moving-coil instrument gives an
f.s.d. when the current is 40mA and its resistance is
25. Calculate the value of the shunt to be
connected in parallel with the meter to enable it to
be used as an ammeter for measuring currents up
to 50A.
The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 12.3,
Figure 12.3
where ra = resistance of instrument = 25,
Rs = resistance of shunt,
Ia =maximum permissible current ﬂowing in
instrument = 40mA = 0.04A,
Is =current ﬂowing in shunt,
I =total circuit current required to give
f.s.d. = 50A
Since
I =Ia + Is then Is = I −Ia = 50 −0.04
= 49.96A
V =Iara = IsRs
Hence Rs = Iara
Is
= (0.04)(25)
49.96
= 0.02002
= 20.02m
Thus for the moving-coil instrument to be used as an
ammeter with a range 0–50A, a resistance of value
20.02m needs to be connected in parallel with the
instrument.
Problem 2.
A moving-coil instrument having a
resistance of 10 gives an f.s.d. when the current is
8mA. Calculate the value of the multiplier to be
connected in series with the instrument so that it
can be used as a voltmeter for measuring p.d.s up to
100V.
The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 12.4,
Figure 12.4
where ra =resistance of instrument = 10,
RM =resistance of multiplier,
I =total permissible instrument current
=8mA = 0.008A,
V =total p.d. required to give f.s.d. = 100V
V =Va + VM = Ira + IRM
i.e.
100=(0.008)(10) + (0.008) RM
or
100 −0.08 = 0.008RM

Part 2
Electrical measuring instruments and measurements
161
thus
RM = 99.92
0.008 =12490=12.49k
Hence for the moving-coil instrument to be used as a
voltmeter with a range 0–100V, a resistance of value
12.49k needs to be connected in series with the
instrument.

connection in each case.
12.4 Electronic instruments
Electronic measuring instruments have advantages over
instruments such as the moving-iron or moving-coil
meters, in that they have a much higher input resistance
(someashighas1000M)andcanhandleamuchwider
range of frequency (from d.c. up to MHz).
The digital voltmeter (DVM) is one which provides
a digital display of the voltage being measured. Advan-
tages of a DVM over analogue instruments include
higher accuracy and resolution, no observational or
parallax errors (see Section 12.18) and a very high input
resistance, constant on all ranges.
A digital multimeter is a DVM with additional cir-
cuitry which makes it capable of measuring a.c. voltage,
d.c. and a.c. current and resistance.
Instruments for a.c. measurements are generally cal-
ibrated with a sinusoidal alternating waveform to indi-
cate r.m.s. values when a sinusoidal signal is applied to
the instrument. Some instruments, such as the moving-
iron and electro-dynamic instruments, give a true r.m.s.
indication. With other instruments the indication is
either scaled up from the mean value (such as with the
rectiﬁer moving-coil instrument) or scaled down from
the peak value.
Sometimes quantities to be measured have complex
waveforms (see Section 12.12), and whenever a quan-
tity is non-sinusoidal, errors in instrument readings can
occur if the instrument has been calibrated for sine
waves only.
Such waveform errors can be largely eliminated by
using electronic instruments.
12.5 The ohmmeter
An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical
resistance.
AsimpleohmmetercircuitisshowninFigure12.5(a).
Unlike the ammeter or voltmeter, the ohmmeter circuit
does not receive the energy necessary for its operation
from the circuit under test. In the ohmmeter this energy
is suppliedby a self-containedsource of voltage,such as
a battery. Initially, terminals XX are short-circuited and
R adjusted to give f.s.d. on the milliammeter. If current
I is at a maximum value and voltage E is constant, then
resistance R = E/I is at a minimum value. Thus f.s.d. on
the milliammeter is made zero on the resistance scale.
When terminals XX are open circuited no current ﬂows
and R(=E/O) is inﬁnity, ∞.
Figure 12.5

Part 2
162
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
The milliammeter can thus be calibrated directly in
ohms. A cramped (non-linear) scale results and is ‘back
to front’, as shown in Figure 12.5(b). When calibrated,
an unknown resistance is placed between terminals XX
and its value determinedfrom the position of the pointer
on the scale. An ohmmeter designed for measuring low
values of resistance is called a continuity tester. An
ohmmeter designed for measuring high values of resis-
tance (i.e. megohms) is called an insulation resistance
tester (e.g. ‘Megger’).
12.6 Multimeters
Instruments are manufactured that combine a moving-
coil meter with a number of shunts and series mul-
tipliers, to provide a range of readings on a single
scale graduated to read current and voltage. If a battery
is incorporated then resistance can also be measured.
Such instruments are called multimeters or universal
instruments or multirange instruments. An ‘Avome-
ter’ is a typical example. A particular range may be
selected either by the use of separate terminals or
by a selector switch. Only one measurement can be
performed at a time. Often such instruments can be
used in a.c. as well as d.c. circuits when a rectiﬁer is
incorporated in the instrument.
Digital multimeters (DMM) are now almost uni-
versally used, the Fluke Digital Multimeter being an
industry leader for performance, accuracy, resolution,
ruggedness, reliability and safety. These instruments
measure d.c. currents and voltages, resistance and con-
tinuity, a.c. (r.m.s.) currents and voltages, temperature
and much more.
12.7 Wattmeters
A wattmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical
power in a circuit. Figure 12.6 shows typical connec-
tions of a wattmeter used for measuring power supplied
to a load. The instrument has two coils:
Figure 12.6
(i)
a current coil, which is connected in series with
the load, like an ammeter, and
(ii)
a voltage coil, which is connected in parallel with
the load, like a voltmeter.
12.8 Instrument ‘loading’ effect
Some measuring instruments depend for their operation
on power taken from the circuit in which measure-
ments are being made. Depending on the ‘loading’
effect of the instrument (i.e. the current taken to enable
it to operate), the prevailing circuit conditions may
change.
The resistance of voltmeters may be calculated since
each have a stated sensitivity (or ‘ﬁgure of merit’), often
stated in ‘k per volt’ of f.s.d. A voltmeter should have
as high a resistance as possible – ideally inﬁnite.
In a.c. circuits the impedance of the instrument
varies with frequency and thus the loading effect of the
instrument can change.
Problem 3.
Calculate the power dissipated by the
voltmeter and by resistor R in Figure 12.7 when
(a) R = 250, (b) R = 2M. Assume that the
voltmeter sensitivity (sometimes called ﬁgure of
merit) is 10k/V.
Figure 12.7
(a)
Resistance of voltmeter, Rv = sensitivity×f.s.d.
Hence, Rv = (10k/V)×(200V) = 2000k

163
When R = 250, current in resistor, IR = V
R
= 100
250 = 0.4A
Power dissipated in load resistor R = VIR
= (100)(0.4) = 40W
Thus the power dissipated in the voltmeter is
insigniﬁcant in comparison with the power dissi-
pated in the load.
(b)
When R = 2M, current in resistor,
IR = V
R =
100
2×106 =50×10−6 A
Power dissipated in load resistor
R = VIR = 100×50×10−6 = 5mW
In this case the higher load resistance reduced the
power dissipated such that the voltmeter is using
as much power as the load.
Problem 4.
An ammeter has an f.s.d. of 100mA
and a resistance of 50. The ammeter is used to
measure the current in a load of resistance 500
when the supply voltage is 10V. Calculate (a) the
ammeter reading expected (neglecting its
resistance), (b) the actual current in the circuit,
(c) the power dissipated in the ammeter and (d) the
power dissipated in the load.
From Figure 12.8,

(b)

Thus the ammeter itself has caused the circuit
conditions to change from 20mA to 18.18mA
(c)
Power dissipated in the ammeter

(d)
Power dissipated in the load resistor

Problem 5.
A voltmeter having an f.s.d. of 100V
and a sensitivity of 1.6k/V is used to measure
voltage V1 in the circuit of Figure 12.9.
Determine (a) the value of voltage V1 with the
voltmeter not connected, and (b) the voltage
indicated by the voltmeter when connected
between A and B.

(b) The resistance of a voltmeter having a 100V f.s.d.

When the voltmeter is connected across the 40k
resistor the circuit is as shown in Figure 12.10(a)
and the equivalent resistance of the parallel net-
work is given by

A considerable error is thus caused by the loading effect
of the voltmeter on the circuit. The error is reduced by
using a voltmeter with a higher sensitivity.
Problem 6.
(a) A current of 20A ﬂows through a
load having a resistance of 2. Determine the
power dissipated in the load. (b) A wattmeter,
whose current coil has a resistance of 0.01, is
connected as shown in Figure 12.11. Determine the
wattmeter reading.

(b)
With the wattmeter connected in the circuit the
total resistance RT is 2 + 0.01 = 2.01
The wattmeter reading is thus I 2RT = (20)2(2.01)

resistor is measured by a voltmeter of f.s.d.
250V and sensitivity 100/V. Determine the
voltage indicated.

A 240V supply is connected across a load of
resistance R. Also connected across R is a
voltmeter having an f.s.d. of 300V and a ﬁgure

the power dissipated by the voltmeter and
by the load resistance if (a) R =100 (b)
R =1M. Comment on the results obtained.
12.9 The oscilloscope
The oscilloscope is
basically a
graph-displaying
device – it draws a graph of an electrical signal. In most
applications the graph shows how signals change over
time. From the graph it is possible to:
•
determine the time and voltage values of a signal
•
calculate the frequency of an oscillating signal
•
see the ‘moving parts’ of a circuit represented by
the signal
•
tell if a malfunctioning component is distorting the
signal
•
ﬁnd out how much of a signal is d.c. or a.c.
•
tell how much of the signal is noise and whether
the noise is changing with time
Oscilloscopes are used by everyone from television
repair technicians to physicists. They are indispensable
for anyone designing or repairing electronic equipment.
The usefulness of an oscilloscope is not limited to the
world of electronics. With the proper transducer (i.e.
a device that creates an electrical signal in response
to physical stimuli, such as sound, mechanical stress,
pressure, light or heat), an oscilloscope can measure
any kind of phenomena. An automobile engineer uses

Part 2
Electrical measuring instruments and measurements
165
an oscilloscope to measure engine vibrations; a medical
researcher uses an oscilloscope to measure brain waves,
and so on.
Oscilloscopes are available in both analogue and dig-
ital types. An analogue oscilloscope works by directly
applying a voltage being measured to an electron beam
moving across the oscilloscope screen. The voltage
deﬂects the beam up or down proportionally, tracing
the waveform on the screen. This gives an immediate
picture of the waveform.
In contrast, a digital oscilloscope samples the wave-
form and uses an analogue-to-digital converter (see
Section 20.11, page 320) to convert the voltage being
measured into digital information. It then uses this dig-
ital information to reconstruct the waveform on the
screen.
For many applications either an analogue or digital
oscilloscope is appropriate. However, each type does
possess some unique characteristics making it more or
less suitable for speciﬁc tasks.
Analogue oscilloscopes are often preferred when it
is important to display rapidly varying signals in ‘real
time’ (i.e. as they occur).
Digital oscilloscopes allow the capture and viewing
of events that happen only once. They can process the
digital waveform data or send the data to a computer
for processing. Also, they can store the digital wave-
form data for later viewing and printing. Digital storage
oscilloscopes are explained in Section 12.11.
Analogue oscilloscopes
When an oscilloscope probe is connected to a circuit, the
voltage signal travels through the probe to the vertical
system of the oscilloscope. Figure 12.12 shows a simple
block diagram that shows how an analogue oscilloscope
displays a measured signal.
Depending on how the vertical scale (volts/division
control) is set, an attenuator reduces thesignal voltage or
an ampliﬁer increases the signal voltage. Next, the sig-
nal travels directly to the vertical deﬂection plates of the
cathode ray tube (CRT). Voltage applied to these deﬂec-
tion plates causes a glowing dot to move. (An electron
beam hitting phosphor inside the CRT creates the glow-
ing dot.) A positive voltage causes the dot to move up
while a negative voltage causes the dot to move down.
The signal also travels to the trigger system to start or
trigger a ‘horizontal sweep’. Horizontal sweep is a term
referring to the action of the horizontal system causing
the glowing dot to move across the screen. Triggering
the horizontal system causes the horizontal time base
to move the glowing dot across the screen from left
to right within a speciﬁc time interval. Many sweeps
in rapid sequence cause the movement of the glowing
dot to blend into a solid line. At higher speeds, the dot
may sweep across the screen up to 500000 times each
second.
Together, the horizontal sweeping action (i.e. the X
direction) and the vertical deﬂection action (i.e. the Y

direction), trace a graph of the signal on the screen.
The trigger is necessary to stabilize a repeating signal.
It ensures that the sweep begins at the same point of a
repeating signal, resulting in a clear picture.
In conclusion, to use an analogue oscilloscope, three
basic settings to accommodate an incoming signal need
to be adjusted:
•
the attenuation or ampliﬁcation of the signal –
use the volts/division control to adjust the ampli-
tude of the signal before it is applied to the vertical
deﬂection plates
•
the time base – use the time/division control to
set the amount of time per division represented
horizontally across the screen
•
the triggering of the oscilloscope – use the trig-
ger level to stabilize a repeating signal, as well as
triggering on a single event.
Also,adjustingthefocusandintensitycontrolsenable
a sharp, visible display to be created.
(i)
With direct voltage measurements, only the Y
ampliﬁer ‘volts/cm’ switch on the oscilloscope is
used. With no voltage applied to the Y plates the
position of the spot trace on the screen is noted.
When a direct voltage is applied to the Y plates
the new position of the spot trace is an indication
of the magnitude of the voltage. For example, in
Figure 12.13(a), with no voltage applied to the Y
plates, the spot trace is in the centre of the screen
(initial position) and then the spot trace moves
2.5cm to the ﬁnal position shown, on application
of a d.c. voltage. With the ‘volts/cm’ switch on
10volts/cm the magnitude of the direct voltage is
2.5cm×10volts/cm, i.e. 25 volts.
(ii)
With alternating voltage measurements, let a
sinusoidal waveform be displayed on an oscillo-
scope screen as shown in Figure 12.13(b). If the
time/cm switch is on, say, 5ms/cm then the peri-
odic time T of the sinewave is 5ms/cm×4cm, i.e.
20ms or 0.02s
Since frequencyf = 1
T ,frequency=
1
0.02 =50Hz
If the ‘volts/cm’ switch is on, say, 20 volts/cm
then the amplitude or peak value of the sinewave
shown is 20volts/cm×2cm, i.e. 40V.
Figure 12.13
Since r.m.s. voltage = peak voltage
√2
,
(see Chapter 16),
r.m.s. voltage = 40
√2 = 28.28 volts
Double beam oscilloscopes are useful whenever two
signals are to be compared simultaneously.
The oscilloscope demands reasonable skill in adjust-
ment and use. However, its greatest advantage is in
observing the shape of a waveform – a feature not
possessed by other measuring instruments.
Digital oscilloscopes
Some of the systems that make up digital oscillo-
scopes are the same as those in analogue oscilloscopes;
however, digital oscilloscopes contain additional data
processing systems – as shown in the block diagram of
Figure 12.14. With the added systems, the digital oscil-
loscope collects data for the entire waveform and then
displays it.
When a digital oscilloscope probe is attached to a
circuit, the vertical system adjusts the amplitude of the
signal, just as in the analogue oscilloscope. Next, the
analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) in the acquisition
system samples the signal at discrete points in time and

converts the signals’ voltage at these points to digital
values called sample points. The horizontal systems’
sample clock determines how often the ADC takes a
sample. The rate at which the clock ‘ticks’ is called the
sample rate and is measured in samples per second.
The sample points from the ADC are stored in mem-
ory as waveform points. More than one sample point
may make up one waveform point.
Together, the waveform points make up one wave-
form record. The number of waveform points used to
Figure 12.15
make a waveform record is called a record length. The
trigger system determines the start and stop points of
the record.The display receivesthese recordpoints after
being stored in memory.
Dependingonthecapabilitiesofanoscilloscope,add-
itional processing of the sample points may take place,
enhancing the display. Pre-trigger may be available,
allowing events to be seen before the trigger point.
Fundamentally, with a digital oscilloscope as with an
analogue oscilloscope, there is a need to adjust vertical,
horizontal and trigger settings to take a measurement.
A typical double-beam digital ﬂuke oscilloscope is
shown in Figure 12.15.

12.10 Virtual test and measuring
instruments
Computer-basedinstrumentsarerapidlyreplacingitems
of conventional test equipment in many of today’s test
and measurement applications. Probably the most com-
monly available virtual test instrument is the digital
storage oscilloscope (DSO). Because of the processing
power available fromthe PC coupledwith the mass stor-
age capability, a computer-based virtual DSO is able to
provide a variety of additional functions, such as spec-
trum analysis and digital display of both frequency and
voltage. In addition, the ability to save waveforms and
captured measurement data for future analysis or for
comparison purposes can be extremely valuable, partic-
ularly where evidence of conformance with standards
or speciﬁcations is required.

Part 2
170
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Unlike a conventional oscilloscope (which is pri-
marily intended for waveform display), a computer-
based virtual oscilloscope effectively combines several
test instruments in one single package. The functions
and available measurements from such an instrument
usually includes:
•
real-time or stored waveform display
•
precise time and voltage measurement (using
adjustable cursors)
•
digital display of voltage
•
digital display of frequency and/or periodic time
•
accurate measurement of phase angle
•
frequency spectrum display and analysis
•
datalogging(storedwaveformdatacanbeexported
in formats that are compatible with conventional
spreadsheet packages, e.g. as .xls ﬁles)
•
ability to save/print waveforms and other infor-
mation in graphical format (e.g. as .jpg or .bmp
ﬁles).
Virtual instruments can take various forms, including:
•
internal hardwarein the form of a conventionalPCI
expansion card
•
external hardware unit which is connected to the
PC by means of either a conventional 25-pin par-
allel port connector or by means of a serial USB
connector.
The software (and any necessary drivers) is invari-
ably supplied on CD-ROM or can be downloaded
from the manufacturer’s website. Some manufacturers
also supply software drivers together with sufﬁcient
accompanying documentation in order to allow users
to control virtual test instruments from their own soft-
ware developed using popular programming languages
such as VisualBASIC or C++.
12.11 Virtual digital storage
oscilloscopes
Several types of virtual DSO are currently available.
These can be conveniently arranged into three different
categories according to their application:
•
low-cost DSO
•
high-speed DSO
•
high-resolution DSO.
Unfortunately,there is often some confusionbetween
the last two categories. A high-speed DSO is designed
for examining waveforms that are rapidly changing.
Such an instrument does not necessarily provide high-
resolution measurement. Similarly, a high-resolution
DSO is useful for displaying waveforms with a high
degree of precision, but it may not be suitable for exam-
ining fast waveforms. The difference between these two
types of DSO should become a little clearer later on.
Low-cost DSO are primarily designed for low-
frequency signals (typically signals up to around
20kHz) and are usually able to sample their signals at
rates of between 10K and 100K samples per second.
Resolution is usually limited to either 8-bits or 12-bits
(corresponding to 256 and 4096 discrete voltage levels,
respectively).
High-speed DSOs are rapidly replacing CRT-based
oscilloscopes. They are invariably dual-channel instru-
ments and provide all the features associated with a
conventional ‘scope’, including trigger selection, time-
base and voltage ranges, and anability tooperate in X–Y
mode.
Additional features available with a computer-based
instrumentincludetheabilitytocapturetransientsignals
(as with a conventional digital storage ‘scope’) and save
waveforms for future analysis. The ability to analyse a
signal in terms of its frequency spectrum is yet another
feature that is only possible with a DSO (see later).
Upper frequency limit
The upper signal frequencylimit ofa DSO is determined
primarily by the rate at which it can sample an incom-
ing signal. Typical sampling rates for different types of
virtual instrument are:
Type of DSO
Typical sampling rate
Low-cost DSO
20K to 100K per second
High-speed DSO
100M to 1000M per second
High-resolution DSO
20M to 100M per second
In order to display waveforms with reasonable accu-
racy it is normally suggested that the sampling rate
should be at least twice and preferably more than ﬁve
times the highest signal frequency. Thus, in order to
display a 10MHz signal with any degree of accuracy
a sampling rate of 50M samples per second will be
required.

Part 2
Electrical measuring instruments and measurements
171
The ‘ﬁve times rule’ merits a little explanation.When
sampling signals in a digital-to-analogue converter we
usually apply the Nyquist∗criterion that the sampling
frequency must be at least twice the highest analogue
signal frequency. Unfortunately, this no longer applies
in the case of a DSO where we need to sample at an even
faster rate if we are to accurately display the signal.
In practise we would need a minimum of about ﬁve
points within a single cycle of a sampled waveform in
order to reproduce it with approximate ﬁdelity. Hence
the sampling rate should be at least ﬁve times that of the
highest signal frequency in order to display a waveform
reasonably faithfully.
A special case exists with dual channel DSOs. Here
the sampling rate may be shared between the two chan-
nels. Thus an effective sampling rate of 20M samples
per second might equate to 10M samples per second
for each of the two channels. In such a case the upper
frequency limit would not be 4MHz but only a mere
2MHz.
The approximate bandwidth required to display dif-
ferent types of signals with reasonable precision is given
in the table below:
Signal
Bandwidth
required (approx.)
Low-frequency and power
d.c. to 10kHz
Audio frequency (general)
d.c. to 20kHz
Audio frequency
d.c. to 50kHz

Square and pulse waveforms
d.c. to 100kHz
(up to 5kHz)
Fast pulses with small
d.c. to 1MHz
rise-times
Video
d.c. to 10MHz
Radio (LF, MF and HF)
d.c. to 50MHz
The general rule is that, for sinusoidal signals, the
bandwidth should ideally be at least double that of the
highest signal frequency whilst for square wave and

4 April 1976) received the IRE Medal of Honour in 1960 for
contributions to thermal noise, data transmission and negative
feedback. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
pulse signals, the bandwidth should be at least ten times
that of the highest signal frequency.
It is worth noting that most manufacturers deﬁne the
bandwidth of an instrument as the frequency at which
a sine wave input signal will fall to 0.707 of its true
amplitude (i.e. the −3dB point). To put this into context,
at the cut-off frequency the displayed trace will be in
error by a whopping 29%!
Resolution
The relationship between resolution and signal accuracy
(not bandwidth) is simply that the more bits used in the
conversion process the more discrete voltage levels can
be resolved by the DSO. The relationship is as follows:
x = 2n
where x is the number of discrete voltage levels and n is
the number of bits. Thus, each time we use an additional
bit in the conversion process we double the resolution
of the DSO, as shown in the table below:
Number of bits, n
Number of discrete
voltage levels, x
8-bit
256
10-bit
1024
12-bit
4096
16-bit
65 536
Buffer memory capacity
A DSO stores its captured waveform samples in a buffer
memory. Hence, for a given sampling rate, the size of
this memory buffer will determine for how long the
DSO can capture a signal before its buffer memory
becomes full.
The relationship between sampling rate and buffer
memory capacity is important. A DSO with a high
sampling rate but small memory will only be able to use
its full sampling rate on the top few time base ranges.
To put this into context, it’s worth considering a sim-
ple example. Assume that we need to display 10000
cycles of a 10MHz square wave. This signal will occur
in a time frame of 1ms. If applying the ‘ﬁve times rule’
wewouldneedabandwidthofatleast50MHztodisplay
this signal accurately.
To reconstruct the square wave we would need a min-
imum of about ﬁve samples per cycle so a minimum

Part 2
172
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
sampling rate would be 5×10MHz=50M samples per
second. To capture data at the rate of 50M samples per
second for a time interval of 1ms requires a memory that
can store 50000samples. If each sample uses 16-bitswe
would require 100kbyte of extremely fast memory.
Accuracy
The measurement resolution or measurement accuracy
of a DSO (in terms of the smallest voltage change that
can be measured) depends on the actual range that is
selected. So, for example,on the 1V range an 8-bit DSO
is able to detect a voltage change of one two hundredand
ﬁfty sixth of a volt or (1/256) V or about 4mV. For most
measurement applications this will proveto be perfectly
adequate as it amounts to an accuracy of about 0.4% of
full-scale.
Figure 12.23 depicts a PicoScope software dis-
play showing multiple windows providing conventional
oscilloscope waveform display, spectrum analyser dis-
play, frequency display and voltmeter display.
Adjustable cursors make it possible to carry out
extremely accurate measurements. In Figure 12.24 the
Figure 12.23

peak value of the (nominal 10V peak) waveform is
measured at precisely 9625mV (9.625V). The time to
reach the peak value (from 0V) is measured as 246.7μs
(0.2467ms).
The addition of a second time cursor makes it possible
to measure the time accurately between two events. In
Figure 12.25, event ‘o’ occurs 131 ns before the trigger
point whilst event ‘x’ occurs 397 ns after the trigger
point. The elapsed time between these two events is
528ns. The two cursors can be adjusted by means of the
mouse (or other pointing device) or, more accurately,
using the PC’s cursor keys.
Autoranging
Autoranging is another very useful feature that is often
provided with a virtual DSO. If you regularly use a con-
ventional ‘scope’ for a variety of measurements you
will know only too well how many times you need
to make adjustments to the vertical sensitivity of the
instrument.
High-resolution DSO
High-resolution DSOs are used for precision applica-
tions where it is necessary to faithfully reproduce a
waveform and also to be able to perform an accu-
rate analysis of noise ﬂoor and harmonic content.
Typical applications include small-signal work and
high-quality audio.
Unlike the low-cost DSO, which typically has 8-bit
resolution and poor d.c. accuracy, these units are usu-
ally accurate to better than 1% and have either 12-bit or
16-bit resolution. This makes them ideal for audio, noise
and vibration measurements.
The increased resolution also allows the instrument to
be used as a spectrum analyser with very wide dynamic

Part 2

173
range (up to 100dB). This feature is ideal for perform-
ing noise and distortion measurements on low-level
analogue circuits.
Bandwidth alone is not enough to ensure that a DSO
can accurately capture a high-frequencysignal. Thegoal
of manufacturersis to achieve a ﬂat frequencyresponse.
This response is sometimes referred to as a Maximally
Flat Envelope Delay (MFED). A frequency response of
this type delivers excellent pulse ﬁdelity with minimum
overshoot, undershoot and ringing.
It is important to remember that if the input signal is
not a pure sine wave it will contain a number of higher-
frequency harmonics. For example, a square wave will
contain odd harmonics that have levels that become pro-
gressively reduced as their frequency increases. Thus,
to display a 1MHz square wave accurately you need
to take into account the fact that there will be signal
components present at 3MHz, 5MHz, 7MHz, 9MHz,
11MHz and so on.
Spectrum analysis
The technique of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)

Figure 12.26 shows the frequency spectrum of the
1kHz sine wave signal from a low-distortion signal
generator. Here the virtual DSO has been set to cap-
ture samples at a rate of 4096 per second within
a frequency range of d.c. to 12.2kHz. The dis-
play clearly shows the second harmonic (at a level
of −50dB or −70dB relative to the fundamental),
plus further harmonics at 3kHz, 5kHz and 7kHz
(all of which are greater than 75dB down on the
fundamental).

(expressed in dB) between the signals marked ‘o’
and ‘x’ and (c) the amplitude of the second
harmonic relative to the fundamental signal ‘o’

(a)
The signal x is at a frequency of 3553kHz. This is
three times the frequencyof the signal at ‘o’ which
is at 1184kHz. Thus, x is the third harmonic of
the signal ‘o’
(b)
The signal at ‘o’ has an amplitude of +17.46dB
whilst
the signal at ‘x’ has an amplitude
of −4.08dB. Thus, the difference in level
= (+17.46)−(−4.08) = 21.54dB

The amplitude of the second harmonic (shown
at approximately 2270kHz) = −5dB
12.12 Waveform harmonics
(i)
Let an instantaneous voltage v be represented by
v = Vm sin2πft volts. This is a waveform which
varies sinusoidally with time t, has a frequency
f , and a maximum value Vm. Alternating volt-
ages are usually assumed to have wave shapes
which are sinusoidal, where only one frequency
is present. If the waveform is not sinusoidal it is
called a complex wave, and, whatever its shape, it
may be split up mathematically into components
called the fundamental and a number of har-
monics. This process is called harmonic analysis.
The fundamental (or ﬁrst harmonic) is sinusoidal
and has the supply frequency, f ; the other har-
monics are also sine waves having frequencies
which are integer multiples of f . Thus, if the sup-
ply frequency is 50Hz, then the third harmonic
frequency is 150Hz, the ﬁfth 250Hz, and so on.

monic waveforms of the appropriate amplitudes
are added,a goodapproximationto a square wave
results. In Figure 12.28(b), the third harmonic is
shown having an initial phase displacement from
the fundamental. The positive and negative half
cycles of each of the complex waveforms shown
in Figures 12.28(a) and (b) are identical in shape,
and this is a feature of waveforms containing the
fundamental and only odd harmonics.

A complex waveform comprising the sum of the
fundamental and a second harmonic of about half
the amplitude of the fundamental is shown in
Figure 12.28(c), each waveform being initially

monics of appropriate amplitudes are added a
good approximation to a triangular wave results.
In Figure 12.28(c) the negative cycle appears as
a mirror image of the positive cycle about point
A. In Figure 12.28(d) the second harmonic is
shown with an initial phase displacement from
the fundamentaland the positive and negative half
cycles are dissimilar.

A complex waveform comprising the sum of
the fundamental, a second harmonic and a third
harmonicis shownin Figure12.28(e),each wave-

complex waveform comprising the sum of the
fundamental, a second harmonic and a third har-
monic are shown with initial phase displacement.
The positive and negative half cycles are seen to
be dissimilar.
The features mentioned relative to Figures
12.28(a) to (f) make it possible to recognize
the harmonics present in a complex waveform
displayed on an oscilloscope.

tities measured at different points in the system are
often expressed in logarithmic units. By deﬁnition, if
the ratio of two powers P1 and P2 is to be expressed in
decibel (dB) units, then the number of decibels, X, is
given by:

(from the laws of logarithms – see Chapter 2).
From equation (1), X decibels is a logarithmic ratio of
two similar quantities and is not an absolute unit of mea-
surement. It is therefore necessary to state a reference
level to measure a number of decibels above or below
that reference. The most widely used reference level for
power is 1mW, and when power levels are expressed in
decibels, above or below the 1mW reference level, the
unit given to the new power level is dBm.
A voltmeter can be re-scaled to indicate the power
level directly in decibels. The scale is generally cali-
brated by taking a reference level of 0dB when a power
of 1mW is dissipated in a 600 resistor (this being the
natural impedance of a simple transmission line). The
reference voltage V is then obtained from

instrument reading being adjusted to read zero current
only. The method assumes:
(i)
if there is any deﬂection at all, then some current
is ﬂowing;
(ii)
if there is no deﬂection, then no current ﬂows (i.e.
a null condition).
Hence it is unnecessary for a meter sensing current
ﬂow to be calibrated when used in this way. A sen-
sitive milliammeter or microammeter with centre-zero
position setting is called a galvanometer. Examples
where the method is used are in the Wheatstone bridge
(see Section 12.15), in the d.c. potentiometer (see
Section 12.16)and with a.c. bridges (see Section 12.17).

occur in measurements are those due to:
(i)
the limitations of the instrument
(ii)
the operator
(iii)
the instrument disturbing the circuit
(i)
Errors in the limitations of the instrument
The calibration accuracy of an instrument
depends on the precision with which it is con-
structed. Every instrument has a margin of error
which is expressed as a percentage of the instru-
ment’s full-scale deﬂection.
Forexample,industrial-gradeinstrumentshave
an accuracy of ±2% of f.s.d. Thus if a voltmeter
has an f.s.d. of 100V and it indicates 40V, say,
then the actual voltage may be anywhere between
40±(2% of 100), or 40±2, i.e. between 38V
and 42V.
When an instrument is calibrated, it is com-
pared against a standard instrument and a graph
is drawn of ‘error’ against ‘meter deﬂection’.
A typical graph is shown in Figure 12.34 where
it is seen that the accuracy varies over the scale
length. Thus a meter with a ±2% f.s.d. accuracy
would tend to have an accuracy which is much
better than ±2% f.s.d. over much of the range.
Calibration is usually carried out by ISO accred-
ited organisations following appropriate quality
standards. (ISO is the International Organisation
for Standardisation.)

(ii)
Errors by the operator
It is easy foran operatorto misread an instrument.
With linear scales the values of the sub-divisions
are reasonably easy to determine; non-linear
scale graduations are more difﬁcult to estimate.
Also, scales differ from instrument to instru-
ment and some meters have more than one
scale (as with multimeters) and mistakes in read-
ing indications are easily made. When reading
a meter scale it should be viewed from an
angle perpendicular to the surface of the scale
at the location of the pointer; a meter scale
should not be viewed ‘at an angle’. Errors by
the operator are largely eliminated using digital
instruments.
(iii)
Errors due to the instrument disturbing the
circuit
Anyinstrumentconnectedintoacircuitwillaffect
that circuit to some extent. Meters require some
power to operate, but providedthis power is small
compared with the power in the measured circuit,
then little error will result. Incorrect position-
ing of instruments in a circuit can be a source
of errors. For example, let a resistance be mea-
sured bythe voltmeter-ammetermethodas shown
in Figure 12.35. Assuming ‘perfect’ instruments,
the resistance should be given by the voltmeter
reading divided by the ammeter reading (i.e.
R = V /I).
However, in Figure 12.35(a), V /I = R + ra
and in Figure 12.35(b) the current through the
ammeter is that through the resistor plus that

ing divided by the ammeter reading will not give

Problem 19.
The current ﬂowing through a
resistor of 5k±0.4% is measured as 2.5mA with
an accuracy of measurement of ±0.5%. Determine
the nominal value of the voltage across the resistor
and its accuracy.
Voltage, V = IR = (2.5×10−3)(5×103) =12.5V.
The maximum possible error is 0.4% + 0.5% = 0.9%
Hence the voltage, V =12.5V±0.9% of 12.5V
= 0.9/100×12.5 = 0.1125V = 0.11V correct to 2 sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgures. Hence the voltage V may also be
expressed as 12.5±0.11 volts (i.e. a voltage lying
between 12.39V and 12.61V).
Problem 20.
The current I ﬂowing in a resistor R
is measured by a 0–10A ammeter which gives an
indication of 6.25A. The voltage V across the
resistor is measured by a 0–50V voltmeter, which
gives an indication of 36.5V. Determine the
resistance of the resistor, and its accuracy of
measurement if both instruments have a limit of
error of 2% of f.s.d. Neglect any loading effects of
the instruments.
Resistance, R = V
I = 36.5
6.25 = 5.84
Voltage error is ±2% of 50V = ±1.0V and expressed
as a percentage of the voltmeter reading gives
±1
36.5 ×100% = ±2.74%
Current error is ±2% of 10A = ±0.2A and expressed
as

±0.2
6.25 ×100% = ±3.2%
Maximum relative error = sum of errors = 2.74% +
3.2% = ±5.94%, and 5.94% of 5.84 = 0.347
Hence the resistance of the resistor may be expressedas:
5.84±5.94%, or 5.84±0.35 (rounding off).

The maximum relative error of Rx is given by the sum

Hence Rx =43.25±1.7%

Semiconductor diodes
Why it is important to understand: Semiconductor diodes
Semiconductors have had a monumental impact on our society. Semiconductors are found at the heart of
microprocessor chips as well as transistors. Anything that’s computerized or uses radio waves depends
on semiconductors. Today, most semiconductor chips and transistors are created with silicon; semicon-
ductors are the foundation of modern electronics. Semiconductor-based electronic components include
transistors, solar cells, many kinds of diodes including the light-emitting diode (LED), the silicon con-
trolled rectiﬁer, photo-diodes, and digital and analogueintegrated circuits. A diode is the simplest possible
semiconductor device. The ability of the diode to conduct current easily in one direction, but not in the
reverse direction, is very useful. For example, in a car, diodes allow current from the alternator to charge
the battery when the engine is running. However, when the engine stops, the diode prevents the battery
from discharging through the alternator (preventing damage). Diodes are widely used in power supplies
and battery chargers to convert the mains a.c. voltage to a d.c. level (rectiﬁers). They are also used to
protect elements and systems from excessive voltages or currents, polarity reversals, arcing and shorting.
Diodes are one of the most fundamental devices that are used in electronics. This chapter explains the
operation of the p–n junction, and the characteristics and applications of various types of diode.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
classify materials as conductors, semiconductors or insulators
•
appreciate the importance of silicon and germanium
•
understand n-type and p-type materials
•
understand the p–n junction
•
appreciate forward and reverse bias of p–n junctions
•
recognize the symbols used to represent diodes in circuit diagrams
•
understand the importance of diode characteristics and maximum ratings
•
know the characteristics and applications of various types of diode – signal diodes, rectiﬁers, zener diodes,
silicon controlled rectiﬁers, light emitting diodes, varactor diodes and Schottky diodes

13.1 Types of material
Materials may be classiﬁed as conductors, semicon-
ductors or insulators. The classiﬁcation depends on the
value of resistivity of the material. Good conductors are
usually metals and have resistivities in the order of 10−7
to 10−8m, semiconductors have resistivities in the
order of 10−3 to 3×103 m, and the resistivities of insu-
lators are in the order of 104 to 1014 m. Some typical
approximate values at normal room temperatures are:
Conductors
Aluminium
2.7 ×10−8m
Brass (70 Cu/30 Zn)

Copper (pure annealed) 1.7 ×10−8m

PVC
≥1013 m
Rubber (pure) 1012 to 1014 m
In general, over a limited range of temperatures, the
resistance of a conductor increases with temperature
increase, the resistance of insulators remains approxi-
mately constant with variation of temperature and the
resistance of semiconductor materials decreases as the
temperature increases. For a specimen of each of these
materials, having the same resistance (and thus com-
pletely different dimensions) at, say, 15◦C, the variation
for a small increase in temperature to t ◦C is as shown
in Figure 13.1.
As the temperature of semiconductor materials is
raised above room temperature,the resistivity is reduced
and ultimately a point is reached where they effectively
become conductors. For this reason, silicon should not
operate at a working temperature in excess of 150◦C
to 200◦C, depending on its purity, and germanium

should not operate at a working temperature in excess
of 75◦C to 90◦C, depending on its purity. As the tem-
perature of a semiconductor is reduced below normal
room temperature, the resistivity increases until, at
very low temperatures, the semiconductor becomes an
insulator.
13.2 Semiconductor materials
From Chapter 4, it was stated that an atom contains both
negative charge carriers (electrons) and positive charge
carriers (protons). Electrons each carry a single unit
of negative electric charge while protons each exhibit
a single unit of positive charge. Since atoms normally
contain an equal number of electrons and protons, the
net charge present will be zero. For example, if an atom
has 11 electrons, it will also contain 11 protons. The
end result is that the negative charge of the electrons
will be exactly balanced by the positive charge of the
protons.
Electrons are in constant motion as they orbit around
the nucleus of the atom. Electron orbits are organized
into shells. The maximum number of electrons present
in the ﬁrst shell is two, in the second shell eight, and in
thethird,fourthandﬁfthshellsitis18,32and50,respec-
tively. In electronics, only the electron shell furthermost
from the nucleus of an atom is important. It is important
to note that the movement of electrons between atoms
only involves those present in the outer valence shell.
If the valence shell contains the maximum number
of electrons possible, the electrons are rigidly bonded
together and the material has the properties of an insu-
lator (see Figure 13.2). If, however, the valence shell
does not have its full complement of electrons, the elec-
trons can be easily detached from their orbital bonds,
and the material has the properties associated with an
electrical conductor.
In its pure state, silicon is an insulator because the
covalent bonding rigidly holds all of the electrons,
leaving no free (easily loosened) electrons to conduct

current. If, however, an atom of a different element (i.e.
an impurity) is introduced that has ﬁve electrons in
its valence shell, a surplus electron will be present (see
Figure 13.3). These free electrons become available for
use as charge carriers and they can be made to move
through the lattice by applying an external potential
difference to the material.
Similarly, if the impurity element introduced into the
pure silicon lattice has three electrons in its valence
shell, the absence of the fourth electron needed for
proper covalent bonding will produce a number of
spaces into which electrons can ﬁt (see Figure 13.4).
These spaces are referred to as holes. Once again, cur-
rent will ﬂow when an external potential difference is
applied to the material.
Regardless of whether the impurity element produces
surplus electrons or holes, the material will no longer

behave as an insulator, neither will it have the properties
that we normally associate with a metallic conductor.
Instead, we call the material a semiconductor – the
term simply serves to indicate that the material is no
longer a good insulator nor is it a good conductor but
is somewhere in between. Examples of semiconduc-
tor materials include silicon (Si), germanium (Ge),
gallium arsenide (GaAs) andindium arsenide (InAs).
Antimony, arsenic and phosphorus are n-type
impurities and form an n-type material when any of
these impurities are added to pure semiconductor mate-
rial such as silicon or germanium. The amount of
impurityaddedusuallyvariesfrom1partimpurityin10 5
parts semiconductor material to 1 part impurity to 10 8
parts semiconductor material, depending on the resis-
tivity required. Indium, aluminium and boron are all
p-type impurities and form a p-type material when any
of these impurities are added to a pure semiconductor.
The process of introducingan atom of another (impu-
rity) element into the lattice of an otherwise pure mate-
rial is called doping. When the pure material is doped
with an impurity with ﬁve electrons in its valence shell
(i.e. a pentavalent impurity) it will become an n-type
(i.e. negative type) semiconductormaterial. If, however,
the pure material is doped with an impurity having three
electronsinitsvalenceshell(i.e.a trivalentimpurity)it
will become a p-type (i.e. positive type) semiconductor
material. Note that n-type semiconductor material con-
tains an excess of negative charge carriers, and p-type
material contains an excess of positive charge carriers.
In semiconductormaterials, there are very few charge
carriers per unit volume free to conduct. This is
because the ‘four electron structure’ in the outer shell
of the atoms (called valency electrons), form strong
covalent bonds with neighbouring atoms, resulting in

Part 2

a tetrahedral(i.e. four-sided) structure with the electrons
held fairly rigidly in place.
13.3 Conduction in semiconductor
materials
Arsenic, antimony and phosphorus have ﬁve valency
electrons and when a semiconductor is doped with one
of these substances, some impurity atoms are incorpo-
rated in the tetrahedral structure. The ‘ﬁfth’ valency
electron is not rigidly bonded and is free to conduct,
the impurity atom donating a charge carrier.

Indium, aluminium and boron have three valency
electrons, and when a semiconductor is doped with one
of these substances, some of the semiconductor atoms
are replaced by impurity atoms. One of the four bonds
associated with the semiconductor material is deﬁcient
by one electron and this deﬁciency is called a hole.
Holesgiverisetoconductionwhenapotentialdifference
exists across the semiconductor material due to move-
ment of electrons from one hole to another, as shown in
Figure 13.5. In this diagram, an electron moves from A
to B, giving the appearance that the hole moves from B
to A. Then electronC movesto A, givingthe appearance
that the hole moves to C, and so on.
13.4 The p–n junction
A p–n junction is a piece of semiconductor material in
which part of the material is p-type and part is n-type.
Figure 13.6
In order to examine the charge situation, assume that
separate blocks of p-type and n-type materials are pus-
hed together. Also assume that a hole is a positive charge
carrier and that an electron is a negative charge carrier.
At the junction, the donated electrons in the n-type
material, called majority carriers, diffuse into the
p-type material (diffusion is from an area of high den-
sity to an area of lower density) and the acceptor holes
in the p-type material diffuse into the n-type material,
as shown by the arrows in Figure 13.6. Because the
n-type material has lost electrons, it acquires a positive
potential with respect to the p-type material and thus
tends to prevent further movement of electrons. The
p-type material has gained electrons and becomes
negatively charged with respect to the n-type material
and hence tends to retain holes. Thus after a short
while, the movement of electrons and holes stops due
to the potential difference across the junction, called
the contact potential. The area in the region of the
junction becomes depleted of holes and electrons due to
electron-hole recombination, and is called a depletion
layer, as shown in Figure 13.7.
Figure 13.7

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Problem 1.
Explain brieﬂy the terms given below
when they are associated with a p–n junction:
(a) conduction in intrinsic semiconductors,
(b) majority and minority carriers, and
(c) diffusion.
(a)
Silicon or germaniumwith no dopingatoms added
are called intrinsic semiconductors. At room
temperature, some of the electrons acquire sufﬁ-
cient energy for them to break the covalent bond
between atoms and become free mobile electrons.
This is called thermal generation of electron-
hole pairs. Electrons generated thermally create
a gap in the crystal structure called a hole, the
atom associated with the hole being positively
charged, since it has lost an electron. This positive
charge may attract another electron released from
another atom, creating a hole elsewhere. When
a potential is applied across the semiconductor
material, holes drift towards the negative termi-
nal (unlike charges attract), and electrons towards
the positive terminal, and hence a small current
ﬂows.
(b)
When additional mobile electrons are introduced
by doping a semiconductor material with pentava-
lent atoms (atoms having ﬁve valency electrons),
these mobile electrons are called majority carri-
ers. The relatively few holes in the n-type material
produced by intrinsic action are called minority
carriers.
For p-type materials, the additional holes are
introduced by doping with trivalent atoms (atoms
having three valency electrons). The holes are
apparently positive mobile charges and are major-
ity carriers in the p-type material. The relatively
few mobile electrons in the p-type material pro-
duced by intrinsic action are called minority
carriers.
(c)
Mobile holes and electrons wander freely within
the crystal lattice of a semiconductor material.
There are more free electrons in n-type material
than holes and more holes in p-type material than
electrons. Thus, in their random wanderings, on
average, holes pass into the n-type material and
electrons into the p-type material. This process is
called diffusion.
Problem 2.
Explain brieﬂy why a junction
between p-type and n-type materials creates a
contact potential.
Intrinsic semiconductors have resistive properties, in
that when an applied voltage across the material is
reversed in polarity, a current of the same magnitude
ﬂows in the opposite direction. When a p–n junction is
formed, the resistive property is replaced by a rectify-
ing property, that is, current passes more easily in one
direction than the other.
An n-type material can be considered to be a station-
ary crystal matrix of ﬁxed positivechargestogether with
a number of mobile negative charge carriers (electrons).
The total number of positive and negative charges are
equal. A p-type material can be considered to be a num-
ber of stationary negative charges together with mobile
positive charge carriers (holes).
Again, the total number of positive and negative
charges are equal and the material is neither positively
nor negatively charged. When the materials are brought
together, some of the mobile electrons in the n-type
material diffuse into the p-type material. Also, some
of the mobile holes in the p-type material diffuse into
the n-type material.
Many of the majority carriers in the region of the
junction combine with the opposite carriers to complete
covalent bonds and create a region on either side of
the junction with very few carriers. This region, called
the depletion layer, acts as an insulator and is in the
order of 0.5μm thick. Since the n-type material has
lost electrons, it becomes positively charged. Also, the
p-type material has lost holes and becomes negatively
charged, creating a potential across the junction, called
the barrier or contact potential.
13.5 Forward and reverse bias
When an external voltage is applied to a p–n junc-
tion making the p-type material positive with respect
to the n-type material, as shown in Figure 13.8, the
p–n junction is forward biased. The applied voltage
opposes the contact potential, and, in effect, closes
the depletion layer. Holes and electrons can now
cross the junction and a current ﬂows. An increase
in the applied voltage above that required to narrow
the depletion layer (about 0.2V for germanium and
0.6V for silicon), results in a rapid rise in the current
ﬂow.
When an external voltage is applied to a p–n junction
making the p-type material negative with respect to the
n-type material, as shown in Figure 13.9, the p–n junc-
tion is reverse biased. The applied voltage is now in
the same sense as the contact potential and opposes the

Part 2

movement of holes and electrons due to opening up the
depletion layer. Thus, in theory, no current ﬂows. How-
ever, at normal room temperature certain electrons in
the covalent bond lattice acquire sufﬁcient energy from
the heat available to leave the lattice, generating mobile
electrons and holes. This process is calledelectron-hole
generation by thermal excitation.
The electrons in the p-type material and holes in
the n-type material caused by thermal excitation are
called minority carriers and these will be attracted by
the applied voltage. Thus, in practice, a small current of
a few microamperes for germanium and less than one
microampere for silicon, at normal room temperature,
ﬂows under reverse bias conditions.
Graphs depicting the current–voltagerelationship for
forward and reverse biased p–n junctions, for both
germanium and silicon, are shown in Figure 13.10.

Figure 13.10
A typical characteristic for a silicon p–n junction is
shown in Figure 13.10. When the positive terminal of
the battery is connected to the p-type material and the
negative terminal to the n-type material, the diode is
forward biased. Due to like charges repelling, the holes
in the p-type material drift towards the junction. Simi-
larly, the electrons in the n-type material are repelled
by the negative bias voltage and also drift towards the
junction. The width of the depletion layer and size
of the contact potential are reduced. For applied volt-
ages from 0 to about 0.6V, very little current ﬂows. At
about 0.6V, majority carriers begin to cross the junc-
tion in large numbers and current starts to ﬂow. As
the applied voltage is raised above 0.6V, the current
increases exponentially (see Figure 13.10).
Whenthenegativeterminalofthebatteryisconnected
to the p-type material and the positive terminal to the
n-type material the diode is reverse biased. The holes
in the p-type material are attracted towards the nega-
tive terminal and the electrons in the n-type material are
attracted towards the positive terminal (unlike charges
attract). This drift increases the magnitude of both the
contactpotentialandthethicknessofthedepletionlayer,
so that only very few majority carriers have sufﬁcient
energy to surmount the junction.
The thermally excitedminoritycarriers, however,can
cross the junctionsince it is, in effect, forwardbiased for
thesecarriers.Themovementofminoritycarriersresults
in a small constant current ﬂowing. As the magnitude of
the reverse voltage is increased a point will be reached

wherealargecurrentsuddenlystartstoﬂow.Thevoltage
at which this occurs is called the breakdown voltage.
This current is due to two effects:
(i)
the zener effect, resulting from the applied volt-
age being sufﬁcient to break some of the covalent
bonds, and
(ii)
the avalanche effect, resulting from the charge
carriers moving at sufﬁcient speed to break cova-
lent bonds by collision.
Problem 4.
The forward characteristic of a diode
is shown in Figure 13.11. Use the characteristic to
determine (a) the current ﬂowing in the diode when
a forward voltage of 0.4V is applied, (b) the voltage
dropped across the diode when a forward current of
9mA is ﬂowing in it, (c) the resistance of the diode
when the forward voltage is 0.6V, and (d) whether
the diode is a Ge or Si type.

13.6 Semiconductor diodes
When a junction is formed between p-type and n-type
semiconductor materials, the resulting device is called
a semiconductor diode. This component offers an
extremelylow resistance to currentﬂow in one direction
and an extremely high resistance to current ﬂow in
the other. This property allows diodes to be used in
applications that require a circuit to behave differently
according to the direction of current ﬂowing in it. Note
that an ideal diode would pass an inﬁnite current in one
direction and no current at all in the other direction.
A semiconductor diode is an encapsulated p–n jun-
ction ﬁtted with connecting leads or tags for connection
to external circuitry. Where an appreciable current is
present (as is the case with many rectiﬁer circuits) the
diode may be mounted in a metal package designed to

Part 2

conduct heat away from the junction. The connection to
the p-type material is referred to as the anode while that
to the n-type material is called the cathode.
Various different types of diode are available for dif-
ferent applications. These include rectiﬁer diodes for
use in power supplies, zener diodes for use as voltage
reference sources, light emitting diodes and varactor
diodes. Figure 13.14 shows the symbols used to repre-
sent diodes in electronic circuit diagrams, where ‘a’ is
the anode and ‘k’ the cathode.

13.7 Characteristics and maximum
ratings
Signal diodes require consistent forward characteristics
with low forward voltage drop. Rectiﬁer diodes need
to be able to cope with high values of reverse voltage
and large values of forward current, and consistency of
characteristics is of secondaryimportance in such appli-
cations. Table 13.1 summarizes the characteristics of
some common semiconductor diodes. It is worth noting
that diodes are limited by the amount of forward cur-
rent and reverse voltage they can withstand. This limit
is based on the physical size and construction of the
diode.
A typical general-purpose diode may be speciﬁed as
havingaforwardthresholdvoltageof0.6Vandareverse
breakdown voltage of 200V. If the latter is exceeded,
the diode may suffer irreversible damage. Typical val-
ues of maximum repetitive reverse voltage (VRRM) or
peak inverse voltage (PIV) range from about 50V to
over 500V. The reverse voltage may be increased until
the maximum reverse voltage for which the diode is
rated is reached. If this voltage is exceeded the junction
may break down and the diode may suffer permanent
damage.
13.8 Rectiﬁcation
The process of obtaining unidirectional currents and
voltages from alternating currents and voltages is called
rectiﬁcation. Semiconductor diodes are commonly
used to convertalternatingcurrent(a.c.) to direct current
(d.c.), in which case they are referred to as rectiﬁers.
The simplest form of rectiﬁer circuit makes use of a sin-
gle diode and, since it operates on only either positive
or negative halfcycles of the supply, it is known as a
half-wave rectiﬁer. Four diodes are connected as a
bridge rectiﬁer – see Figure 13.14(d) – and are
often used as a full-wave rectiﬁer. Note that in
both cases, automatic switching of the current is
carried out by the diode(s). For methods of half-
wave and full-wave rectiﬁcation, see Section 16.8,
page 254.
13.9 Zener diodes
Zener diodes are heavily doped silicon diodes that,
unlike normal diodes, exhibit an abrupt reverse break-
down at relatively low voltages (typically less than

6V). A similar effect, called avalanche breakdown,
occurs in less heavily doped diodes. These avalanche
diodes also exhibit a rapid breakdown with negligible
current ﬂowing below the avalanche voltage and a rela-
tively large current ﬂowing once the avalanche voltage
has been reached. For avalanche diodes, this break-
down voltage usually occurs at voltages above 6V. In
practice, however, both types of diode are referred to
as Zener∗diodes. The symbol for a Zener diode is
shown in Figure 13.14(b) whilst a typical Zener diode
characteristic is shown in Figure 13.16.
Whereas reverse breakdown is a highly undesir-
able effect in circuits that use conventional diodes,
it can be extremely useful in the case of Zener
diodes where the breakdown voltage is precisely
known. When a diode is undergoing reverse break-
down and provided its maximum ratings are not
exceeded, the voltage appearing across it will remain
substantially constant (equal to the nominal Zener volt-
age) regardless of the current ﬂowing. This property
makes the Zener diode ideal for use as a voltage
regulator.
∗Who was Zener? Clarence Melvin Zener (1 December
1905–15 July 1993) was the ﬁrst person to describe the
breakdown of electrical insulators. To ﬁnd out more go to

Zener diode when a reverse voltage of 30V appears
across it.

13.10 Silicon controlled rectiﬁers
Silicon controlled rectiﬁers (or thyristors) are three-
terminaldeviceswhichcanbeusedforswitchinganda.c.
power control. Silicon controlled rectiﬁers can switch
very rapidly from conducting to a non-conductingstate.
In the off state, the silicon controlled rectiﬁer exhibits
negligibleleakagecurrent,whileintheonstatethedevice
exhibits very low resistance. This results in very little
power loss within the silicon controlled rectiﬁer even
when appreciable power levels are being controlled.
Once switched into the conducting state, the sili-
con controlled rectiﬁer will remain conducting (i.e. it
is latched in the on state) until the forward current
is removed from the device. In d.c. applications this
necessitates the interruption (or disconnection) of the
supply before the device can be reset into its non-
conducting state. Where the device is used with an
alternating supply, the devicewill automaticallybecome
reset whenever the main supply reverses. The device can
then be triggered on the next half cycle having correct
polarity to permit conduction.
Like their conventional silicon diode counterparts,
silicon controlled rectiﬁers have anode and cathode
connections; control is applied by means of a gate ter-
minal, g. The symbol for a silicon controlled rectiﬁer is
shown in Figure 13.14(c).
In normal use, a silicon controlled rectiﬁer (SCR) is
triggered into the conducting (on) state by means of the
application of a current pulse to the gate terminal – see
Figure 13.18. The effective triggering of a silicon con-
trolled rectiﬁer requires a gate trigger pulse having a fast
rise time derived from a low-resistance source. Trigger-
ing can become erratic when insufﬁcient gate current
is available or when the gate current changes slowly.

13.11 Light emitting diodes
Light emitting diodes (LED) can be used as general-
purpose indicators and, compared with conventional
ﬁlament lamps, operate from signiﬁcantly smaller volt-
ages and currents. LEDs are also very much more
reliable than ﬁlament lamps. Most LEDs will provide a
reasonable level of light output when a forward current
of between 5mA and 20mA is applied.
LEDs are available in various formats, with the round
types being most popular. Round LEDs are commonly
available in the 3mm and 5mm (0.2 inch) diameter
plastic packages and also in a 5mm×2mm rectangu-
lar format. The viewing angle for round LEDs tends
to be in the region of 20◦to 40◦, whereas for rect-
angular types this is increased to around 100◦. The
peak wavelength of emission depends on the type of
semiconductor employed, but usually lies in the range
630 to 690nm. The symbol for an LED is shown in
Figure 13.14(f).
13.12 Varactor diodes
It was shown earlier that when a diode is operated in
the reverse biased condition, the width of the depletion
region increases as the applied voltage increases. Vary-
ing the width of the depletion region is equivalent to
varying the plate separation of a very small capacitor
such that the relationship between junction capacitance
and applied reverse voltage will look something like
that shown in Figure 13.19. The typical variation of
capacitance provided by a varactor is from about 50pF
to 10pF as the reverse voltage is increased from 2V
to 20V. The symbol for a varactor diode is shown in
Figure 13.14(h).

13.13 Schottky diodes
The conventional p–n junction diode explained in
Section 13.4 operates well as a rectiﬁer and switch-
ing device at relatively low frequencies (i.e. 50Hz to
400Hz) but its performance as a rectiﬁer becomes
seriously impaired at high frequencies due to the
presence of stored charge carriers in the junction. These
have the effect of momentarily allowing current to
ﬂow in the reverse direction when reverse voltage is
applied. This problembecomesincreasingly more prob-
lematic as the frequency of the a.c. supply is increased
and the periodic time of the applied voltage becomes
smaller.
To avoid these problems a diode that uses a metal–
semiconductor contact rather than a p–n junction (see
Figure 13.20) is employed. When compared with con-
ventional silicon junction diodes, these Schottky∗
diodes have a lower forward voltage (typically 0.35V)
and a slightly reduced maximum reverse voltage rat-
ing (typically 50V to 200V). Their main advantage,
however, is that they operate with high efﬁciency in
switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) at frequencies
of up to 1MHz. Schottky diodes are also extensively
used in the constructionof integratedcircuits designed
for high-speed digital logic applications.
∗Who was Schottky? Walter Hermann Schottky (23 July
1886–4 March 1976) played a major role in developing
the theory of electron and ion emission phenomena, invented the
screen-grid vacuum tube and the pentode and co-invented the
Ribbon microphone and loudspeaker with Dr. Gerwin Erlach

Chapter 14
Transistors
Why it is important to understand: Transistors
Theinventionofthebipolartransistorin1948startedarevolutioninelectronics.Technicalfeatspreviously
requiring relatively large, mechanically fragile, power-hungry vacuum tubes were suddenly achievable
with tiny, mechanically rugged, power-thrifty specks of crystalline silicon. This revolution made possible
the design and manufacture of lightweight, inexpensive electronic devices that we now take for granted.
Understanding how transistors function is of paramount importance to anyone interested in understand-
ing modern electronics. A transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that can perform two
functions that are fundamental to the design of electronic circuits – ampliﬁcation and switching. Put
simply, ampliﬁcation consists of magnifying a signal by transferring energy to it from an external source,
whereas a transistor switch is a device for controlling a relatively large current between or voltage across
two terminals by means of a small control current or voltage applied at a third terminal. Transistors can
be mass produced at very low costs, and transistors are the reason that computers keep getting smaller
yet more powerful every day. There are more than 60 million transistors built every year for every man,
woman and child on Earth. Transistors are the key to our modern world. This chapter explains the
structure and operation of the transistor, incorporating some simple calculations.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
understand the structure of bipolar junction transistors (BJT) and junction gate ﬁeld effect transistors (JFET)
•
understand the action of BJT and JFET devices
•
appreciate different classes and applications for BJT and JFET devices
•
draw the circuit symbols for BJT and JFET devices
•
appreciate common base, common emitter and common collector connections
•
appreciate common gate, common source and common drain connections
•
interpret characteristics for BJT and JFET devices
•
appreciate how transistors are used as Class-A ampliﬁers
•
use a load line to determine the performance of a transistor ampliﬁer
•

14.1 Transistor classiﬁcation
Transistors fall into two main classes – bipolar and
ﬁeld effect. They are also classiﬁed according to semi-
conductor material employed – silicon or germanium,
and to their ﬁeld of application (for example, general
purpose, switching, high frequency, and so on). Tran-
sistors are also classiﬁed according to the application
that they are designed for, as shown in Table 14.1.
Note that these classiﬁcations can be combined so that
it is possible, for example, to classify a transistor as
a ‘low-frequency power transistor’ or as a ‘low-noise
high-frequency transistor’.
14.2 Bipolar junction
transistors (BJTs)
Bipolar transistors generally comprise n–p–n or p–n–p
junctions of either silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge)
material. The junctions are, in fact, produced in a sin-
gle slice of silicon by diffusing impurities through a
photographically reduced mask. Silicon transistors are
superior when compared with germanium transistors in
the vast majority of applications (particularly at high
temperatures) and thus germanium devices are very
rarely encountered in modern electronic equipment.
The construction of typical n–p–n and p–n–p tran-
sistors is shown in Figures 14.1 and 14.2. In order to
conduct the heat away from the junction (important in
medium- and high-power applications) the collector is
connected to the metal case of the transistor.
The symbols and simpliﬁed junction models for
n–p–n and p–n–p transistors are shown in Figure 14.3.
It is important to note that the base region (p-type mate-
rial in the case of an n–p–n transistor or n-type material
in the case of a p–n–p transistor) is extremely narrow.

14.3 Transistor action
In the n–p–n transistor, connected as shown in
Figure 14.5(a), transistor action is accounted for as
follows:
(a)
the majority carriers in the n-type emitter material
are electrons
(b)
the base–emitter junction is forwardbiased tothese
majority carriers and electrons cross the junction
and appear in the base region
(c)
the base region is very thin and only lightly doped
with holes, so some recombination with holes
occursbutmanyelectronsareleftinthebaseregion
(d)
the base–collector junction is reverse biased to
holes in the base region and electrons in the col-
lector region, but is forward biased to electrons in
the base region; these electrons are attracted by the
positive potential at the collector terminal
(e)
a large proportion of the electrons in the base
region cross the base collector junction into the
collector region, creating a collector current.
The transistor action for an n–p–n device is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 14.6(a). Conventional cur-
rent ﬂow is taken to be in the direction of the motion of
holes, that is, in the opposite direction to electron ﬂow.
Around 99.5% of the electrons leaving the emitter will
cross the base collector junction and only 0.5% of the
electrons will recombine with holes in the narrow base
region.
In the p–n–p transistor, connected as shown in
Figure 14.5(b), transistor action is accounted for as
follows:
(a)
the majority carriers in the emitter p-type material
are holes
(b)
the base–emitter junction is forward biased to the
majority carriers and the holes cross the junction

(c)
the base region is very thin and is only lightly
doped with electrons so although some electron–
hole pairs are formed, many holes are left in the
base region
(d)
the base–collector junction is reverse biased to
electrons in the base region and holes in the collec-
tor region, but forward biased to holes in the base
region; these holes are attracted by the negative
potential at the collector terminal
(e)
a large proportion of the holes in the base region
cross the base–collector junction into the collector
region, creating a collector current; conventional
current ﬂow is in the direction of hole movement.
The transistor action for a p–n–p device is shown dia-
grammatically in Figure 14.6(b). Around 99.5% of the
holes leaving the emitter will cross the base–collector
junction and only 0.5% of the holes will recombine with
electrons in the narrow base region.
14.4 Leakage current
For an n–p–n transistor, the base–collector junction
is reversed biased for majority carriers, but a small
leakage current, ICBO, ﬂows from the collector to the
base due to thermally generated minority carriers (holes
in the collector and electrons in the base) being present.
The base–collector junction is forward biased to these
minority carriers.
Similarly, for a p–n–p transistor, the base–collector
junction is reverse biased for majority carriers. How-
ever, a small leakage current, ICBO, ﬂows from the base
to the collector due to thermally generated minority car-
riers (electrons in the collector and holes in the base),
being present. Once again, the base–collector junction
is forward biased to these minority carriers.
With modern transistors, leakage current is usually
very small (typically less than 100nA) and in most
applications it can be ignored.
Problem 1.
With reference to a p–n–p transistor,
explain brieﬂy what is meant by the term ‘transistor
action’ and why a bipolar junction transistor is so
named.
For the transistor as depicted in Figure 14.5(b), the
emitter is relatively heavily doped with acceptor atoms
(holes). When the emitter terminal is made sufﬁciently
positive with respect to the base, the base–emitter junc-
tion is forward biased to the majority carriers. The
majority carriers are holes in the emitter and these drift
from the emitter to the base.

tor terminal. The control of current from emitter to
collector is largely independent of the collector–base
voltage and almost wholly governed bythe emitter–base
voltage.
The essence of transistor action is this current con-
trol by means of the base–emitter voltage. In a p–n–p
transistor, holes in the emitter and collector regions are
majority carriers, but are minority carriers when in the
base region. Also thermally generated electrons in the
emitter and collector regions are minority carriers as
are holes in the base region. However, both majority
and minority carriers contribute towards the total cur-
rent ﬂow (see Figure 14.7). It is because a transistor
makes use of both types of charge carriers (holes and
electrons) that they are called bipolar. The transistor
also comprises two p–n junctions and for this reason
it is a junction transistor; hence the name – bipolar
junction transistor.
14.5 Bias and current ﬂow
In normal operation (i.e. for operation as a linear ampli-
ﬁer) the base–emitter junction of a transistor is forward
biased and the collector–base junction is reverse biased.
The base region is, however, made very narrow so that
carriers are swept across it from emitter to collector so
that only a relatively small current ﬂows in the base. To
put this into context, the current ﬂowing in the emitter
circuit is typically 100 times greater than that ﬂowing

in the base. The direction of conventional current ﬂow
is from emitter to collector in the case of a p–n–p tran-
sistor, and collector to emitter in the case of an n–p–n
device, as shown in Figure 14.8.
The equation that relates current ﬂow in the collector,
base, and emitter circuits (see Figure 14.8) is:
IE = IB + IC
where IE is the emitter current, IB is the base current
and IC is the collector current (all expressed in the same
units).
Problem 2.
A transistor operates with a collector
current of 100mA and an emitter current of
102mA. Determine the value of base current.
Emitter current, IE =IB +IC
from which, base current, IB =IE −IC
Hence, base current, IB =102−100=2mA
14.6 Transistor operating
conﬁgurations
Three basic circuit conﬁgurations are used for transis-
tor ampliﬁers. These three circuit conﬁgurationsdepend
upon which one of the three transistor connections is
made common to both the input and the output. In the
case of bipolar junction transistors, the conﬁgurations
are known as common emitter, common collector
(or emitter follower) and common base, as shown in
Figure 14.9.

14.7 Bipolar transistor characteristics
The characteristics of a bipolar junction transistor are
usually presented in the form of a set of graphs relating
voltage and current present at the transistor terminals.
Figure 14.10 shows a typical input characteristic (IB
plotted against VBE) for an n–p–n bipolar junction tran-
sistor operating in common-emittermode. In this mode,
the input current is applied to the base and the output
current appears in the collector (the emitter is effectively
common to both the input and output circuits, as shown
in Figure 14.9(a)).
The input characteristic shows that very little base
current ﬂows until the base–emitter voltage VBEexceeds
0.6V. Thereafter, the base current increases rapidly –
this characteristic bears a close resemblance to the
forward part of the characteristic for a silicon diode.
Figure 14.11 shows a typical set of output (collector)
characteristics (IC plotted against VCE) for an n–p–n
bipolar transistor. Each curve corresponds to a different
value of base current. Note the ‘knee’ in the characteris-
tic below VCE =2V. Also note that the curves are quite
ﬂat. For this reason (i.e. since the collector current does
not change very much as the collector–emitter voltage
changes) we often refer to this as a constant current
characteristic.
Figure 14.12 shows a typical transfer characteris-
tic for an n–p–n bipolar junction transistor. Here I C is
plotted against IB for a small-signal general-purpose
transistor. The slope of this curve (i.e. the ratio of IC to
IB) is the common-emitter current gain of the transistor
which is explored further in Section 14.9.

A circuit that can be used for obtaining the common-
emitter characteristics of an n–p–n BJT is shown in
Figure 14.13. For the input characteristic, VR1 is set
at a particular value and the corresponding values of
VBE and IB are noted. This is repeated for various set-
tings of VR1 and plotting the values gives the typical
input characteristic of Figure 14.10.
For the output characteristics, VR1 is varied so that
IB is, say, 20μA. Then VR2 is set at various values and

14.8 Transistor parameters
The transistor characteristics met in the previoussection
provide us with some usefule information that can help
us to model the behaviour of a transistor. In partic-
ular, the three characteristic graphs can be used to
determine the following parameters for operation in
common-emitter mode:
Input

(from
the
input

Static (or d.c.) input resistance= VBE
IB
(from corre-
sponding points on the graph).
Dynamic (or a.c.) input resistance= VBE
IB
(from the
slope of the graph).
(Note that VBE means ‘change of VBE’ and IB means
‘change of IB’.)
Output resistance (from the output characteristic,

Static (or d.c.) output resistance= VCE
IC
(from corre-
sponding points on the graph).
Dynamic (or a.c.) output resistance= VCE
IC
(from the

(Note that VCE means ‘change of VCE’ and IC means
‘change of IC’.)
Current

the
transfer

Dynamic (or a.c.) current gain= IC
IB
(from the slope

(Note that IC means ‘change of IC’ and IB means
‘change of IB’.)
The method for determining these parameters from
the relevant characteristic is illustrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 3.

14.9 Current gain
As stated earlier, the common-emitter current gain is
givenbytheratioofcollectorcurrent,IC,tobasecurrent,
IB. We use the symbol hFE to represent the static value
of common-emitter current gain, thus:
hFE = IC
IB
Similarly, we use hfe to represent the dynamic value of
common-emitter current gain, thus:
hfe = IC
IB
As we showed earlier, values of hFE and hfe can be
obtained from the transfer characteristic (IC plotted
against IB). Note that hFE is found from corresponding

Part 2
Transistors
203
static values while hfe is found by measuring the slope
of the graph. Also note that, if the transfer characteristic
is linear, there is little (if any) difference between hFE
and hfe.
It is worth noting that current gain (hfe) varies with
collector current. For most small-signal transistors, hfe
is a maximum at a collector current in the range 1mA
and 10mA. Current gain also falls to very low values
for power transistors when operating at very high val-
ues of collector current. Furthermore, most transistor
parameters (particularly common-emitter current gain,
hfe) are liable to wide variation from one device to the
next. It is, therefore, important to design circuits on the
basis of the minimum value for hfe in order to ensure
successful operation with a variety of different devices.
Problem 6.

common-emitter current gain of 125. If the
transistor operates with a collector current of
50mA, determine the value of base current.

14.10 Typical BJT characteristics
and maximum ratings
Table 14.2 on page 204 summarizes the characteristics
of some typical bipolar junction transistors for different
applications, where IC max is the maximum collec-
tor current, VCE max is the maximum collector–emitter
voltage, PTOT max is the maximum device power dissi-
pation, and hfe is the typical value of common-emitter
current gain.
Note that the BC548 is a general-purposen-p-n bipo-
lar junction transistor commonly used in European
electronic equipment, low in cost and widely available.
The BC548 is the modern plastic-packaged BC108 and
can be used in any circuit designed for the BC108 or
BC148.

14.11 Field effect transistors
Field effect transistors are available in two basic forms;
junction gate and insulated gate. The gate source junc-
tion of a junction gate ﬁeld effect transistor (JFET)
is effectively a reverse-biased p–n junction. The gate
connection of an insulated gate ﬁeld effect transis-
tor (IGFET), on the other hand, is insulated from the
channel and charge is capacitively coupled to the chan-
nel. To keep things simple, we will consider only JFET
devices. Figure 14.17 shows the basic construction of
an n-channel JFET.

JFET transistors comprise a channel of p-type or
n-type material surrounded by material of the opposite
polarity. The ends of the channel (in which conduction
takes place) form electrodes known as the source and
drain. The effective width of the channel (in which con-
duction takes place) is controlled by a charge placed
on the third (gate) electrode. The effective resistance
between the source and drain is thus determined by the
voltage present at the gate. (The+signs in Figure 14.17
are used to indicate a region of heavy doping thus n +
simply indicates a heavily doped n-type region.)
JFETs offer a very much higher input resistance
when compared with bipolar transistors. For example,
the input resistance of a bipolar transistor operating
in common-emitter mode is usually around 2.5k.

Part 2
Transistors
205
A JFET transistor operating in equivalent common-
source mode would typically exhibit an input resistance
of 100 M! This feature makes JFET devices ideal for
use in applications where a very high input resistance is
desirable.
As with bipolar transistors, the characteristics of a
FET are often presented in the form of a set of graphs
relating voltage and current present at the transistor’s
terminals.
14.12 Field effect transistor
characteristics
A typical mutual characteristic (ID plotted against
VGS) for a small-signal general-purpose n-channel ﬁeld
effect transistor operating in common-source mode is
shown in Figure 14.18. This characteristic shows that
the drain current is progressively reduced as the gate–
source voltage is made more negative.At a certain value
of VGS the drain current falls to zero and the device is
said to be cut-off.

curves, each relating to a different value of gate–source
voltage VGS. You might also like to compare this char-
acteristic with the output characteristic for a transistor
operating in common-emitter mode that you met earlier
in Figure 14.11.

As in the case of the bipolar junction transistor, the
output characteristic curves for an n-channel FET have
a ‘knee’ that occurs at low values of VDS. Also, note
how the curves become ﬂattened above this value with
the drain current ID not changing very signiﬁcantly
for a comparatively large change in drain–source volt-
age VDS. These characteristics are, in fact, even ﬂatter
than those for a bipolar transistor. Because of their ﬂat-
ness, they are often said to represent a constant current
characteristic.
Thegainofferedbyaﬁeldeffecttransistorisnormally
expressed in terms of its forward transconductance
(gfs or Yfs) in common-source mode. In this mode, the
input voltage is applied to the gate and the output current
appears in the drain (the source is effectively common
to both the input and output circuits).
In common-source mode, the static (or d.c.) forward
transfer conductance is given by:
gfs = ID
VGS
(from corresponding points on the graph)
whilst the dynamic (or a.c.) forward transfer
conductance is given by:
gfs = ID
VGS
(from the slope of the graph)
(Note that ID means ‘change of ID’ and VGS means
‘change of VGS’.)
The method for determining these parameters from the
relevant characteristic is illustrated in worked Problem
8 below.
Forward transfer conductance (gfs) varies with drain
current. For most small-signal devices, gfs, is quoted for
values of drain current between 1mA and 10mA. Most
FET parameters (particularly forward transfer conduc-
tance) are liable to wide variation from one device to

on the basis of the minimum value for gfs, in order
to ensure successful operation with a variety of differ-
ent devices. The experimental circuit for obtaining the
common-source characteristics of an n-channel JFET
transistor is shown in Figure 14.20.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
one of the three transistor connections is made common
to both the input and the output). In the case of bipolar
transistors, the conﬁgurations are known as common
emitter, common collector (or emitter follower) and
common base.
Where ﬁeld effect transistors are used, the corre-
sponding conﬁgurations are common source, common
drain (or source follower) and common gate.
These basic circuit conﬁgurations, depicted in
Figures 14.22 and 14.23, exhibit quite different perfor-
mance characteristics, as shown in Tables 14.4 and 14.5,
respectively.
A requirement of most ampliﬁers is that the output
signal should be a faithful copy of the input signal or be
somewhat larger in amplitude. Other types of ampliﬁer
are ‘non-linear’, in which case their input and output
waveforms will not necessarily be similar. In practice,
the degree of linearity provided by an ampliﬁer can be
affected by a number of factors, including the amount of
bias applied and the amplitude of the input signal. It is
also worth noting that a linear ampliﬁer will become
non-linear when the applied input signal exceeds a
threshold value. Beyond this value the ampliﬁer is said
tobeoverdrivenandtheoutputwillbecomeincreasingly
distorted if the input signal is further increased.
The optimum value of bias for linear (Class A)
ampliﬁers is that value which ensures that the
active devices are operated at the mid-point of their
characteristics. In practice, this means that a static value
of collector current will ﬂow even when there is no sig-
nal present. Furthermore, the collector current will ﬂow
throughout the complete cycle of an input signal (i.e.
conduction will take place over an angle of 360 ◦). At
no stage should the transistor be saturated (VCE ≈0V
or VDS ≈0V) nor should it be cut-off (VCE ≈VCC or
VDS ≈VDD).

In order to ensure that a static value of collector cur-
rent ﬂows in a transistor, a small current must be applied
to the base of the transistor. This current can be derived
from the same voltage rail that supplies the collector
circuit (via the collector load). Figure 14.24 shows a
simple Class-A common-emitter circuit in which the
base bias resistor, R1, and collector load resistor, R2,
are connected to a common positive supply rail.
The a.c. signal is applied to the base terminal of the
transistor via a coupling capacitor, C1. This capacitor
removes the d.c. component of any signal applied to the
input terminals and ensures that the base bias current
delivered by R1 is unaffected by any device connected
to the input. C2 couples the signal out of the stage and
also prevents d.c. current ﬂow appearing at the output
terminals.
14.15 Load lines
The a.c. performance of a transistor ampliﬁer stage can
be predicted using a load line superimposed on the rele-
vant set of output characteristics. For a bipolar transistor
operatingin common-emittermode the requiredcharac-
teristics are IC plotted against VCE. One end of the load
line corresponds to the supply voltage (VCC) while the
other end corresponds to the value of collector or drain
current that would ﬂow with the device totally saturated
(VCE =0V). In this condition:
IC = VCC

resistance.

Figure 14.25 shows a load line superimposed on a set
of output characteristics for a bipolar transistor oper-
ating in common-emitter mode. The quiescent point
(or operating point) is the point on the load line that
corresponds to the conditions that exist when no sig-
nal is applied to the stage. In Figure 14.25, the base
bias current is set at 20μA so that the quiescent point
effectively sits roughly halfway along the load line.
This position ensures that the collector voltage can
swing both positively (above) and negatively (below)
its quiescent value (VCQ).
The effect of superimposing an alternating base cur-
rent (of 20μA peak–peak) to the d.c. bias current (of
20μA) can be clearly seen. The correspondingcollector
current signal can be determined by simply moving up
and down the load line.
Problem 11.
The characteristic curves shown in
Figure 14.26 relate to a transistor operating in
common-emitter mode. If the transistor is operated
with IB =30μA, a load resistor of 1.2 k and an
18V supply, determine (a) the quiescent values of
collector voltage and current (VCQ and ICQ), and
(b) the peak–peak output voltage that would be
produced by an input signal of 40μA peak–peak.

(a)
First we need to construct the load line on
Figure14.26.Thetwoendsoftheloadlinewillcor-
respond to VCC, the 18V supply, on the collector–
emitter voltage axis and 18V/1.2 k or 15mA on
the collector current axis.
Next we locate the operating point (or qui-
escent point) from the point of intersection of
the IB =30μA characteristic and the load line.
Having located the operating point we can read
off the quiescent values, i.e. the no-signal val-
ues, of collector–emitter voltage (VCQ) and col-
lector current (ICQ). Hence, VCQ = 9.2V and
ICQ = 7.3mA.
(b)
Next we can determine the maximum and mini-
mum values of collector–emitter voltage by locat-
ingtheappropriateinterceptpointsonFigure14.26.
Note that the maximum and minimum values
of base current will be (30μA+20μA)=50μA
on positive peaks of the signal and (30μA−
20μA)=10μA on negative peaks of the signal.
The maximum and minimum values of VCE are,
respectively, 14.8V and 3.3V. Hence,
the output voltage swing
= (14.8V −3.3V) = 11.5V peak–peak

ICQ =3.3mA.
(b)
The maximum and minimum values of collector–
emitter voltage may be determined by locating the
appropriate intercept points on Figure 14.27. Note
that the maximum and minimum values of base
current will be (50μA+20μA)=70μA on pos-
itive peaks of the signal and (50μA−20μA) =
30μA on negative peaks of the signal. The maxi-

Ohm’s law. However, sometimes in more complex circuits we cannot simply use Ohm’s law alone to ﬁnd
the voltages or currents circulating within the circuit. For these types of calculations we need certain rules
which allow us to obtain the circuit equations and for this we can use Kirchhoff’s laws. In addition, there
are a number of circuit theorems – superposition theorem,Thévenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem– which
allow us to analyse more complex circuits. In addition, the maximum power transfer theorem enables us
to determine maximum power in a d.c. circuit. In this chapter Kirchhoff’s laws and the circuit theorems
are explained in detail using many numerical worked examples. An electrical/electronic engineer often
needs to be able to analyse an electrical network to determine currents ﬂowing in each branch and the
voltage across each branch.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
state and use Kirchhoff’s laws to determine unknown currents and voltages in d.c. circuits
•
understand the superposition theorem and apply it to ﬁnd currents in d.c. circuits
•
understand general d.c. circuit theory
•
understand Thévenin’s theorem and apply a procedure to determine unknown currents in d.c. circuits
•
recognize the circuit diagram symbols for ideal voltage and current sources
•
understand Norton’s theorem and apply a procedure to determine unknown currents in d.c. circuits
•
appreciate and use the equivalence of the Thévenin and Norton equivalent networks
•
state the maximum power transfer theorem and use it to determine maximum power in a d.c. circuit
15.1 Introduction
The laws which determine the currents and voltage
drops in d.c. networks are: (a) Ohm’s law (see Chapter
4), (b) the laws for resistors in series and in parallel (see
Chapter 7) and (c) Kirchhoff’s laws (see Section 15.2
following). In addition, there are a number of circuit
theorems which have been developed for solving prob-
lems in electrical networks. These include:
(i)
the superposition theorem (see Section 15.3),
(ii)
Thévenin’s theorem (see Section 15.5),
(iii)
Norton’s theorem (see Section 15.7) and

15.2 Kirchhoff’s* laws
Kirchhoff’s∗laws state:
(a)
Current Law. At any junction in an electric circuit
the total current ﬂowing towards that junction is
equal to the total current ﬂowing away from the
junction, i.e. I =0
Thus, referring to Figure 15.1:
I1 + I2 = I3 + I4 + I5
or
I1 + I2 −I3 −I4 −I5 = 0
Figure 15.1
∗Who was Kirchhoff? Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (12 March
1824–17 October 1887) was a German physicist. Concepts in
circuit theory and thermal emission are named ‘Kirchhoff’s
laws’ after him, as well as a law of thermochemistry. To ﬁnd
out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
(b)
Voltage Law. In any closed loop in a network, the
algebraic sum of the voltage drops (i.e. products
of current and resistance) taken around the loop is
equal to the resultant e.m.f. acting in that loop.
Thus, referring to Figure 15.2:
E1 −E2 =IR1 + IR2 +IR3
(Note that if current ﬂows away from the positive
terminal of a source, that source is considered by
convention to be positive. Thus moving anticlock-
wise around the loop of Figure 15.2, E1 is positive
and E2 is negative.)
Figure 15.2
Problem 1.
(a) Find the unknown currents
marked in Figure 15.3(a). (b) Determine the value
of e.m.f. E in Figure 15.3(b).
Figure 15.3
(a)
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law:
For junction B: 50=20+I1. Hence I1 =30A
For junction C: 20+15=I2. Hence I2 = 35A
For junction D: I1 =I3 +120
i.e. 30=I3 +120. Hence I3 =−90A
(i.e. in the opposite direction to that shown in
Figure 15.3(a).)
For junction E: I4 +I3 =15
i.e.
I4 =15−(−90).
Hence
I4 =105A
For junction F: 120=I5 +40. Hence I5 =80A

Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law and moving
clockwise around the loop of Figure 15.3(b) start-
ing at point A:
3 + 6 + E −4 = (I)(2) + (I)(2.5) + (I)(1.5)
+ (I)(1)
= I(2 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 1)
i.e.
5+E =2(7), since I =2 A
Hence
E =14−5=9V
Problem 2.
Use Kirchhoff’s laws to determine
the currents ﬂowing in each branch of the network
shown in Figure 15.4.
Figure 15.4
Procedure
1.
Use Kirchhoff’scurrentlaw andlabel currentdirec-
tions on the original circuit diagram. The directions
chosen are arbitrary, but it is usual, as a starting
point, to assume that current ﬂows from the posi-
tive terminals of the batteries. This is shown in
Figure 15.5, where the three branch currents are
expressed in terms of I1 and I2 only, since the
current through R is I1 +I2
Figure 15.5
2.
Divide the circuit into two loops and apply Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law to each. From loop 1 of
Figure 15.5, and moving in a clockwise direction
as indicated (the direction chosen does not matter),
gives
E1 = I1r1 + (I1 + I2)R, i.e. 4 = 2I1 + 4(I1 + I2)
i.e. 6I1 + 4I2 = 4
(1)
From loop 2 of Figure 15.5, and moving in an anti-
clockwise direction as indicated (once again, the
choice of direction does not matter; it does not have
to be in the same direction as that chosen for the ﬁrst
loop), gives:
E2 = I2r2 + (I1 + I2)R, i.e. 2 = I2 + 4(I1 + I2)
i.e. 4I1 + 5I2 = 2
(2)
3.
Solve equations (1) and (2) for I1 and I2
2 × (1) gives: 12I1 + 8I2 = 8
(3)
3 × (2) gives: 12I1 + 15I2 = 6
(4)
(3)–(4) gives: −7I2 =2 hence I2 = −2
7
= −0.286A
(i.e. I2 is ﬂowing in the opposite direction to that
shown in Figure 15.5.)
From (1) 6I1 +4(−0.286)=4
6I1 =4+1.144
Hence
I1 = 5.144
6
=0.857 A
Current ﬂowing through resistance R is
I1 + I2 = 0.857 + (−0.286) = 0.571 A
Note that a third loop is possible, as shown in
Figure 15.6, giving a third equation which can be
used as a check:
E1 −E2 = I1r1 −I2r2
4 −2 = 2I1 −I2
2 = 2I1 −I2

[Check: 2I1 −I2 =2(0.857)−(−0.286)=2]

Problem 3.
Determine, using Kirchhoff’s laws,
each branch current for the network shown in
Figure 15.7.
Figure 15.7
1.
Currents and their directions are shown labelled in
Figure 15.8 following Kirchhoff’s current law. It is
usual,althoughnotessential,tofollowconventional
current ﬂow with current ﬂowing from the positive
terminal of the source.
Figure 15.8
2.
The network is divided into two loops as shown
in Figure 15.8. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law
gives:
For loop 1:
E1 + E2 = I1R1 + I2R2
i.e.
16 = 0.5I1 + 2I2
(1)
For loop 2:
E2 = I2R2 −(I1 −I2)R3
Note that since loop 2 is in the opposite direction
to current (I1 −I2), the volt drop across R3 (i.e.
(I1 −I2)(R3)) is by convention negative.
Thus 12 = 2I2 −5(I1 −I2)
i.e.
12 = −5I1 + 7I2
(2)
3.
Solving equations (1) and (2) to ﬁnd I1 and I2:
10 × (1) gives 160 = 5I1 + 20I2
(3)
(2) + (3) gives 172 = 27I2 hence I2 = 172
27
=6.37 A
From
(1):
16 = 0.5I1 + 2(6.37)
I1 = 16 −2(6.37)
0.5
= 6.52 A
Current ﬂowing in R3 =I1 −I2 =6.52−6.37
=0.15A
Problem 4.
For the bridge network shown in
Figure 15.9 determine the currents in each of the
resistors.
Figure 15.9
Let the current in the 2 resistor be I1, then by Kirch-
hoff’s current law, the current in the 14 resistor is
(I −I1). Let the current in the 32 resistor be I2
as shown in Figure 15.10. Then the current in the
11 resistor is (I1 −I2) and that in the 3 resistor
is (I −I1 +I2). Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to
loop 1 and moving in a clockwise direction as shown
in Figure 15.10 gives:
54 = 2I1 + 11(I1 −I2)
i.e. 13I1 −11I2 = 54
(1)
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to loop 2 and moving
in an anticlockwise direction as shown in Figure 15.10
gives:
Figure 15.10

Part 3

223
0 = 2I1 + 32I2 −14(I −I1)
However
I = 8 A
Hence
0 = 2I1 + 32I2 −14(8 −I1)
i.e.
16I1 + 32I2 = 112
(2)
Equations (1) and (2) are simultaneous equations with
two unknowns, I1 and I2.
16 × (1) gives :
208I1 −176I2 = 864
(3)
13 × (2) gives :
208I1 + 416I2 = 1456
(4)
(4) −(3) gives :
592I2 = 592
I2 = 1A
Substituting for I2 in (1) gives:
13I2 −11 = 54
I1 = 65
13 = 5 A
Hence,
the current ﬂowing in the 2 resistor =I1 =5 A
the current ﬂowing in the 14 resistor=I −I1
=8−5=3 A
the current ﬂowing in the 32 resistor=I2 =1 A
the current ﬂowing in the 11 resistor=I1 −I2 =5−1
=4 A
the current ﬂowing in the 3 resistor =I −I1 +I2
=8−5+1
=4 A

15.3 The superposition theorem
The superposition theorem states:
‘In any network made up of linear resistances and con-
taining more than one source of e.m.f., the resultant
current ﬂowing in any branch is the algebraic sum of
the currents that would ﬂow in that branch if each
source was considered separately, all other sources
being replaced at that time by their respective internal
resistances.’

positive battery terminal as shown.)

15.4 General d.c. circuit theory
The following points involving d.c. circuit analysis
need to be appreciatedbeforeproceedingwith problems
using Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems:

Part 3
D.c. circuit theory
227
(i)
The open-circuit voltage, E, across terminals
AB in Figure 15.26 is equal to 10V, since no
current ﬂows through the 2 resistor and hence
no voltage drop occurs.
Figure 15.26
(ii)
The open-circuit voltage, E, across terminals
AB in Figure 15.27(a) is the same as the volt-
age across the 6  resistor. The circuit may be
redrawn as shown in Figure 15.27(b).
E =

by voltage division in a series circuit, i.e.
E=30V

(iii)
For the circuit shown in Figure 15.28(a) rep-
resenting a practical source supplying energy,
V =E −Ir, where E is the battery e.m.f.,
V is the battery terminal voltage and r is the
internal resistance of the battery (as shown
in Section 6.5). For the circuit shown in
Figure 15.28(b),V =E −(−I)r, i.e. V =E +Ir
Figure 15.28
(iv)
The resistance ‘looking-in’ at terminals AB in
Figure 15.29(a) is obtained by reducing the cir-
cuit in stages as shown in Figures 15.29(b) to
(d). Hence the equivalent resistance across AB
is 7
Figure 15.29
(v)
For the circuit shown in Figure 15.30(a), the 3
resistor carries no current and the p.d. across the
20 resistor is 10V. Redrawing the circuit gives
Figure 15.30(b), from which
E =

4
4 + 6

× 10 = 4V
(vi)
If the 10V battery in Figure 15.30(a) is removed
and replaced by a short-circuit, as shown in
Figure 15.30(c), then the 20 resistor may be
removed. The reason for this is that a short-
circuit has zero resistance, and 20 in paral-
lel with zero ohms gives an equivalent resis-
tance of: (20×0/20+0), i.e. 0. The circuit
is then as shown in Figure 15.30(d), which is
redrawn in Figure 15.30(e).

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
From Figure 15.30(e), the equivalent resistance
across AB,
r = 6 × 4
6 + 4 + 3 = 2.4 + 3 = 5.4
(vii)
To ﬁnd the voltage across AB in Figure 15.31:
since the 20V supply is across the 5 and 15
resistors in series then, by voltage division, the
voltage drop across AC,


(20) = 5V
Similarly, VCB =

(20) = 16V
VC is at a potential of +20V.
VA =VC −VAC =+20−5=15V and
VB =VC −VBC =+20−16=4V
Hence the voltage between AB is VA −VB =
15−4=11V and current would ﬂow from A
to B since A has a higher potential than B.
(viii)
In Figure 15.32(a), to ﬁnd the equivalent resis-
tance across AB the circuit may be redrawn as in
Figures 15.32(b) and (c). From Figure 15.32(c),
the equivalent resistance across AB
= 5 × 15
5 + 15 + 12 × 3
12 + 3 = 3.75 + 2.4 = 6.15
Figure 15.32
(ix)
In the worked problems in Sections 15.5 and
15.7 following, it may be considered that
Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems have no obvi-
ous advantages compared with, say, Kirchhoff’s
laws. However, these theorems can be used to
analyse part of a circuit, and in much more
complicated networks the principle of replac-
ing the supply by a constant voltage source in
series with a resistance (or impedance) is very
useful.
15.5 Thévenin’s theorem
Thévenin’s∗theorem states:
‘The current in any branch of a network is that which
would result if an e.m.f. equal to the p.d. across a break
made in the branch, were introduced into the branch,
all other e.m.f.s being removed and represented by the
internal resistances of the sources.’
The procedure adopted when using Thévenin’s theorem
is summarized below. To determine the current in any
branchof an active network (i.e. one containinga source
of e.m.f.):
(i)
remove the resistance R from that branch,
(ii)
determinethe open-circuitvoltage, E, across the
break,
(iii)
remove each source of e.m.f. and replace them
by their internal resistances and then determine
the resistance, r, ‘looking-in’ at the break,
(iv)
determine the value of the current from the
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 15.33, i.e.
I =
E

P.d. across R2 =I1R2 =1×8=8V
Hence p.d. across AB, i.e. the open-circuit voltage

20 resistance is short-circuited, as shown
in Figure 15.37(c) since its internal resis-

Hence the p.d. between A and B

Point C is at a potential of +54V. Between C and
A is a voltage drop of 8.31V. Hence the voltage at
point A is 54−8.31=45.69V. Between C and B
is a voltage drop of 44.47V. Hence the voltage at
point B is 54−44.47=9.53V. Since the voltage
at A is greater than at B, current must ﬂow in the
direction A to B (see Section 15.4 (vii)).
(iii)
Replacing the source of e.m.f. with a short-circuit
(i.e. zero internal resistance) gives the circuit
shown in Figure 15.38(c). The circuit is redrawn

15.6 Constant-current source
A source of electrical energy can be represented by
a source of e.m.f. in series with a resistance. In
Section 15.5,the Théveninconstant-voltagesource con-
sisted of a constant e.m.f. E in series with an internal
resistance r. However, this is not the only form of rep-
resentation. A source of electrical energy can also be
representedby a constant-currentsource in parallel with
a resistance. It may be shown that the two forms are
equivalent.An ideal constant-voltagegenerator is one
with zero internal resistance so that it supplies the same
voltage to all loads. An ideal constant-current gen-
erator is one with inﬁnite internal resistance so that it
supplies the same current to all loads.
Note the symbol for anidealcurrent source(fromBS EN
60617-2: 1996, which superseded BS 3939-2: 1985),
shown in Figure 15.43.

15.7 Norton’s theorem
Norton’s∗theorem states:
‘The current that ﬂows in any branch of a network is
the same as that which would ﬂow in the branch if it
were connected across a source of electrical energy, the
short-circuit current of which is equal to the current that
would ﬂow in a short-circuit across the branch, and
the internal resistance of which is equal to the resist-
ance which appears across the open-circuited branch
terminals.’
The procedure adopted when using Norton’s theorem is
summarized below.
∗Who was Norton? Edward Lawry Norton (28 July 1898–28
January 1983) is best remembered for development of the dual
of Thevenin’s equivalent circuit, now referred to as Norton’s
equivalent circuit. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/

To determine the current ﬂowing in a resistance R of a
branch AB of an active network:

(ii)

the branch
(iii)

by their internal resistance (or, if a current
source exists, replace with an open-circuit), then
determine the resistance r,‘looking-in’ at a break
made between A and B

If terminals AB in Figure 15.49(a) are short-circuited,
the short-circuit current is given by E/r. If termi-
nals AB in Figure 15.49(b) are short-circuited, the
short-circuit current is ISC. For the circuit shown
in Figure 15.49(a) to be equivalent to the circuit in
Figure15.49(b)thesameshort-circuitcurrentmustﬂow.
Thus ISC =E/r
Figure 15.50 shows a source of e.m.f. E in series with
a resistance r feeding a load resistance R

From Figure 15.51 it can be seen that, when viewed

Thus the two representations shown in Figure 15.49 are
equivalent.

The open-circuit voltage E across terminals AB in
Figure 15.54 is given by:
E = (ISC) (r) = (4) (3) =12V.
The resistance ‘looking-in’ at terminals AB is 3.
Hence the equivalent Thévenin circuit is as shown in
Figure 15.55.

Problem 18.
(a) Convert the circuit to the left of
terminals AB in Figure 15.56(a) to an equivalent
Thévenin circuit by initially converting to a Norton
equivalent circuit. (b) Determine the current
ﬂowing in the 1.8 resistor.
(a)
For the branch containing the 12V source, con-
verting to a Norton equivalent circuit gives
ISC =12/3=4A and r1=3. For the branch con-
taining the 24V source, converting to a Norton
equivalent circuit gives ISC2=24/2=12A and
r2 =2.
Thus Figure 15.56(b) shows a network equivalent
to Figure 15.56(a).
From Figure 15.56(b) the total short-circuit current
is 4+12=16A and the total resistance is given by:
3×2
3+2 =1.2
Thus Figure 15.56(b) simpliﬁes toFigure 15.56(c).
The open-circuit voltage across AB of Figure
15.56(c), E =(16)(1.2)=19.2V, and the resi-
stance ‘looking-in’ at AB is 1.2. Hence the
Thévenin equivalent circuit is as shown in
Figure 15.56(d).
(b)
When the 1.8 resistance is connected between
terminals A and B of Figure 15.56(d) the current
I ﬂowing is given by:

Determine by successive
conversions between Thévenin and Norton
equivalent networks a Thévenin equivalent circuit
for terminals AB of Figure 15.57(a). Hence
determine the current ﬂowing in the 200
resistance.
For the branch containing the 10V source, converting
to a Norton equivalent network gives
ISC =
10
2000 = 5mA and r1 = 2k
For the branch containing the 6V source, converting to
a Norton equivalent network gives
ISC =
6
3000 = 2mA and r2 = 3k
Thus the network of Figure 15.57(a) converts to
Figure 15.57(b).
Combining the 5mA and 2mA current sources gives
the equivalent network of Figure 15.57(c), where the
short-circuit current for the original two branches con-
sidered is 7mA and the resistance is

Figure 15.57

Both of the Norton equivalent networks shown in
Figure 15.57(c) may be converted to Thévenin equiv-
alent circuits. The open-circuit voltage across CD
is: (7×10−3)(1.2×103)=8.4V and the resistance
‘looking-in’ at CD is 1.2k.
The open-circuit voltage across EF is (1×10−3)(600)
=0.6V and the resistance ‘looking-in’ at EF is 0.6k.
Thus Figure 15.57(c)converts to Figure 15.57(d).Com-
bining the two Thévenin circuits gives
E =8.4−0.6=7.8V and the resistance
r =(1.2+0.6) k=1.8k
Thus the Thévenin equivalent circuit for terminals AB
of Figure 15.57(a) is as shown in Figure 15.57(e).
Hence the current I ﬂowing in a 200 resistance
connected between A and B is given by:
I =
7.8
1800+ 200 = 7.8
2000 = 3.9mA

15.9 Maximum power transfer
theorem
The maximum power transfer theorem states:
‘The power transferred from a supply source to a load is
at its maximum when the resistance of the load is equal
to the internal resistance of the source.’
Hence, in Figure 15.62, when R =r the power trans-
ferred from the source to the load is a maximum.
Figure 15.62
Typical practical applications of the maximum power
transfer theorem are found in stereo ampliﬁer design,
seeking to maximize power delivered to speakers, and
in electric vehicle design, seeking to maximize power
delivered to drive a motor.
Problem 20.
The circuit diagram of Figure 15.63
shows dry cells of source e.m.f. 6V, and internal
resistance 2.5. If the load resistance RL is varied
from 0 to 5 in 0.5 steps, calculate the power
dissipated by the load in each case. Plot a graph of
RL (horizontally) against power (vertically) and
determine the maximum power dissipated.

Chapter 16
Alternating voltages and
currents
Why it is important to understand: Alternating voltages and currents
With alternating current (a.c.), the ﬂow of electric charge periodically reverses direction, whereas with
direct current (d.c.), the ﬂow of electric charge is only in one direction. In a power station, electricity can
be made most easily by using a gas or steam turbine or water impeller to drive a generator consisting of a
spinning magnet inside a set of coils. The resultant voltageis always ‘alternating’by virtue of the magnet’s
rotation. Alternating voltage can be carried around the country via cables far more effectively than direct
current because a.c. can be passed through a transformer and a high voltage can be reduced to a low
voltage, suitable for use in homes. The electricity arriving at your home is alternating voltage. Electric
light bulbs and toasters can operate perfectly from 230 volts a.c. Other equipment such as televisions
has an internal power supply which converts the 230 volts a.c. to a low d.c. voltage for the electronic
circuits. How is this done? There are several ways, but the simplest is to use a transformer to reduce
the voltage to, say, 12 volts a.c. This lower voltage can be fed through a ‘rectiﬁer’ which combines the
negative and positive alternating cycles so that only positive cycles emerge. A.c. is the form in which
electric power is delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an a.c. power circuit is
a sine wave. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves.
Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. The frequency
of the electrical system varies by country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60 hertz. Some
countries have a mixture of 50 Hz and 60 Hz supplies, notably Japan. A low frequency eases the design of
electric motors, particularly forhoisting,crushing and rolling applications, andcommutator-type traction
motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable ﬂicker in arc
lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provides the advantage of lower
impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. 16.7 Hz frequency is still used in some European
rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile
industry, marine, computer mainframe, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400 Hz, for
beneﬁts of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. This chapter introduces alternating
current and voltages, with its terminology and values and its sinusoidal expression. Also, the addition of
two sine waves is explained, as are rectiﬁers and their smoothing.

16.1 Introduction
Electricity is produced by generators at power stations
and then distributed by a vast network of transmission
lines (called the National Grid system) to industry and
for domestic use. It is easier and cheaper to generate
alternating current (a.c.) than direct current (d.c.) and
a.c. is more conveniently distributed than d.c. since its
voltagecanbereadilyalteredusingtransformers.When-
ever d.c. is needed in preference to a.c., devices called
rectiﬁers are used for conversion (see Section 16.7).
16.2 The a.c. generator
Let a single turn coil be free to rotate at constant angular
velocity symmetrically between the poles of a magnet
system, as shown in Figure 16.1.
An e.m.f. is generated in the coil (from Faraday’s
laws) which varies in magnitude and reverses its direc-
tion at regular intervals. The reason for this is shown in
Figure 16.2. In positions (a), (e) and (i) the conductors
of the loop are effectively moving along the magnetic
ﬁeld, no ﬂux is cut and hence no e.m.f. is induced.
In position (c) maximum ﬂux is cut and hence maximum
e.m.f. is induced. In position (g), maximum ﬂux is cut
and hence maximum e.m.f. is again induced. However,
using Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced e.m.f. is
Figure 16.1
Figure 16.2

Part 3
244
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
in the opposite direction to that in position (c) and is
thus shown as −E. In positions (b), (d), (f) and (h) some
ﬂux is cut and hence some e.m.f. is induced. If all such
positions of the coil are considered, in one revolution
of the coil one cycle of alternating e.m.f. is produced
as shown. This is the principle of operation of the a.c.
generator (i.e. the alternator).
16.3 Waveforms
If values of quantities which vary with time t are plot-
ted to a base of time, the resulting graph is called
a waveform. Some typical waveforms are shown in
Figure 16.3. Waveforms (a) and (b) are unidirectional
waveforms, for, although they vary considerably with
time, they ﬂow in one direction only (i.e. they do not
cross the time axis and become negative). Waveforms
(c) to (g) are called alternating waveforms since their
quantities are continually changing in direction (i.e.
alternately positive and negative).
Figure 16.3
AwaveformofthetypeshowninFigure16.3(g)iscalled
a sine wave. It is the shape of the waveform of e.m.f.
produced by an alternator and thus the mains electricity
supply is of ‘sinusoidal’ form.
One complete series of values is called a cycle (i.e. from
O to P in Figure 16.3(g)).
The time taken for an alternating quantity to complete
one cycle is called the period or the periodic time, T,
of the waveform.
The number of cycles completed in one second is called
the frequency, f, of the supply and is measured in
hertz,∗Hz. The standard frequency of the electricity
supply in Great Britain is 50Hz.

16.4 A.c. values
Instantaneous values are the values of the alternating
quantities at any instant of time. They are represented
by small letters, i, υ, e, etc. (see Figures 16.3(f)and (g)).
The largest value reached in a half cycle is called the
peak value or the maximum value or the amplitude of
the waveform. Such values are represented by Vm, Im,
etc. (see Figures 16.3(f) and (g)). A peak-to-peak value
of e.m.f. is shown in Figure 16.3(g) and is the difference
between the maximum and minimum values in a cycle.
The average or mean value of a symmetrical alter-
nating quantity (such as a sine wave) is the average value
measured over a half cycle (since over a complete cycle
the average value is zero).
Average or mean value = area under the curve
length of base
The area under the curve is found by approximate
methods such as the trapezoidal rule, the mid-ordinate
rule or Simpson’s rule. Average values are represented
by VAV , IAV , etc.
For a sine wave,
average value=0.637×maximum value
(i.e. 2/π ×maximum value)
The effective value of an alternating current is that cur-
rent which will produce the same heating effect as an
equivalent direct current. The effective value is called
the root mean square (r.m.s.) value and whenever an
alternatingquantityisgiven,itisassumedtobether.m.s.
value. For example, the domestic mains supply in Great
Britain is 240V and is assumed to mean ‘240Vr.m.s’.
The symbols used for r.m.s. values are I, V , E, etc. For
a non-sinusoidal waveform as shown in Figure 16.4 the
r.m.s. value is given by:
I =

16.5 Electrical safety – insulation
and fuses
Insulation is used to prevent ‘leakage’, and when deter-
mining what type of insulation should be used, the
maximum voltage present must be taken into account.
For this reason, peak values are always considered
when choosing insulation materials.
Fuses are the weak link in a circuit and are used to
break the circuit if excessive current is drawn. Exces-
sive current could lead to a ﬁre. Fuses rely on the
heating effect of the current, and for this reason r.m.s
values must always be used when calculating the
appropriate fuse size.
16.6 The equation of a sinusoidal
waveform
In Figure 16.8, OA represents a vector that is free to
rotate anticlockwise about 0 at an angular velocity of
ωrad/s. A rotating vector is known as a phasor.
After time t seconds the vector OA has turned through
an angle ωt. If the line BC is constructed perpendicular
to OA as shown, then
sinωt = BC
OB
i.e. BC = OBsinωt

Part 3

Figure 16.8
If all such vertical components are projected on to a
graph of y against angle ωt (in radians), a sine curve
results of maximum value OA. Any quantity which
varies sinusoidally can thus be represented as a phasor.
A sine curve may not always start at 0◦. To show this

In Figure 16.9(c), y4=sin(ωt−φ) starts φ radians

16.7 Combination of waveforms
The resultant of the addition (or subtraction) of two

(a)
by plotting the periodic functions graphically (see

(see worked Problems 14 and 15).
Problem 13.
The instantaneous values of two
alternating currents are given by i1=20sinωt
amperes and i2 =10sin(ωt +π/3) amperes. By

are shown plot-
ted in Figure 16.10.
Ordinates of i1 and i2 are added at, say, 15◦intervals (a
pair of dividers are useful for this).
Figure 16.10
For example,
at 30◦, i1+i2 =10+10=20A
at 60◦, i1+i2 =8.7+17.3=26A
at 150◦, i1 +i2=10+(−5)=5A, and so on.
The resultant waveform for i1 +i2 is shown by the bro-
ken line in Figure 16.10. It has the same period, and
hence frequency, as i1 and i2. The amplitude or peak
value is 26.5A.

Problem 14.
Two alternating voltages are
represented by v1 =50sinωt volts and
v2 =100sin(ωt −π/6)V. Draw the phasor diagram
and ﬁnd, by calculation, a sinusoidal expression
to represent v1 +v2
Phasors are usually drawnat the instant when time t =0.
Thus v1 is drawn horizontally 50 units long and v2 is
drawn 100 units long, lagging v1 by π/6rads, i.e. 30◦.
This is shown in Figure 16.11(a), where 0 is the point
of rotation of the phasors.
Figure 16.11
Procedure to draw phasor diagram to represent
v1 +v2:
(i)
Draw v1 horizontal 50 units long, i.e. Oa of
Figure 16.11(b)
(ii)
Join v2 to the end of v1 at the appropriate angle,
i.e. ab of Figure 16.11(b)
(iii)
The resultant vR =v1 +v2 is given by the length
Ob and its phase angle φ may be measured with
respect to v1
Alternatively, when two phasors are being added the
resultant is always the diagonal of the parallelogram, as
shown in Figure 16.11(c).
From the drawing, by measurement, vR =145V and
angle φ =20◦lagging v1
A more accurate solution is obtained by calculation,
using the cosine and sine rules. Using the cosine rule on
triangle Oab of Figure 16.11(b) gives:
v2
R = v2

= 2500+ 10000−(−8660)
vR = √(21160) = 145.5V
Using the sine rule, 100
sinφ = 145.5
sin150◦
from which
sinφ = 100sin150◦
145.5
=0.3436
and φ = sin−1 0.3436 = 0.35 radians, and lags v1
Hence vR =v1 +v2 = 145.5sin(ωt−0.35)V
Problem 15.
Find a sinusoidal expression for
(i1+i2) of worked Problem 13, (a) by drawing
phasors, (b) by calculation.
(a)
The relative positions of i1 and i2 at time t =0 are
shown as phasors in Figure 16.12(a). The phasor
diagram in Figure 16.12(b) shows the resultant i R,
and iR is measured as 26A and angle φ as 19◦or
0.33 rads leading i1
Hence, by drawing, iR =26 sin(ωt+0.33)A

Part 3

(b)
From Figure 16.12(b), by the cosine rule:
i2
R =202 +102 −2(20)(10)(cos120◦)
from which iR =26.46A
By the sine rule:
10
sinφ = 26.46
sin120◦
from which φ =19.10◦(i.e. 0.333 rads)
Hence, by calculation
iR =26.46sin(ωt + 0.333)A
An alternative method of calculation is to use complex
numbers (see Chapter 26).
Then i1 + i2 = 20sinωt + 10sin

Problem 16.
Two alternating voltages are given
by v1 =120sinωt volts and v2 =200sin(ωt −π/4)
volts. Obtain sinusoidal expressions for v1 −v2
(a) by plotting waveforms, and (b) by resolution of
phasors.
(a)
v1 =120sinωt
and v2 =200sin(ωt −π/4) are
shown plotted in Figure 16.13. Care must be taken
when subtracting values of ordinates, especially
when at least one of the ordinates is negative. For
example
at 30◦, v1 −v2 = 60−(−52)=112V
at 60◦, v1 −v2 = 104−52=52V
at 150◦, v1 −v2 = 60−193=−133V and so on.
The resultant waveform,vR =v1 −v2, is shown by
the broken line in Figure 16.13. The maximum
value of vR is 143V and the waveform is seen to
lead v1 by 99◦(i.e. 1.73 radians).
Hence, by drawing, vR =v1−v2
=143sin(ωt+1.73)volts
(b)
The relative positions of v1 and v2 are shown at
time t =0 as phasors in Figure 16.14(a). Since the
Figure 16.13
resultant of v1 −v2 is required,−v2 is drawn in the
opposite direction to +v2 and is shown by the bro-
ken line in Figure 16.14(a). The phasor diagram
with the resultant is shown in Figure 16.14(b),
where −v2 is added phasorially to v1
By resolution:
Sum of horizontal components of v1 and v2
= 120cos0◦+ 200cos135◦= −21.42
Sum of vertical components of v1 and v2
= 120sin0◦+ 200sin135◦= 141.4
From Figure 16.14(c), resultant
vR = √[(−21.42)2 + (141.4)2] = 143.0,
and tanφ′ = 141.4
21.42 = tan6.6013, from which
φ′ = tan−1 6.6013 = 81.39◦and
φ = 98.61◦or 1.721 radians
Hence, by resolution of phasors,
vR =v1 −v2 =143.0sin(ωt+1.721)volts
(By complex number: vR = v1 −v2
= 120∠0 −200∠−π
4
= (120 + j0)
−(141.42−j141.42)
= −21.42+ j141.42

or 143.9∠1.721rad
Hence,vR = v1 −v2 = 143.0 sin(ωt + 1.721) volts)

16.8 Rectiﬁcation
The process of obtaining unidirectional currents and
voltages from alternating currents and voltages is called
rectiﬁcation. Automatic switching in circuits is achieved
using diodes (see Chapter 13).
Half-wave rectiﬁcation
Using a single diode, D, as shown in Figure 16.15,
half-wave rectiﬁcation is obtained. When P is sufﬁ-
ciently positive with respect to Q, diode D is switched
on and current i ﬂows. When P is negative with respect
to Q, diode D is switched off. Transformer T isolates

Part 3
Alternating voltages and currents
255
the equipment from direct connection with the mains
supply and enables the mains voltage to be changed.
Figure 16.15
Thus, an alternating, sinusoidal waveform applied to
the transformer primary is rectiﬁed into a unidirectional
waveform. Unfortunately, the output waveform shown
in Figure 16.15 is not constant (i.e. steady), and as such,
would be unsuitable as a d.c. power supply for electronic
equipment. It would, however, be satisfactory as a bat-
tery charger. In Section 16.9, methods of smoothing the
output waveform are discussed.
Full-wave rectiﬁcation using a
centre-tapped transformer
Two diodes may be used as shown in Figure 16.16 to
obtain full-wave rectiﬁcation where a centre-tapped
transformer T is used. When P is sufﬁciently posi-
tive with respect to Q, diode D1 conducts and current
ﬂows (shown by the broken line in Figure 16.16). When
S is positive with respect to Q, diode D2 conducts
and current ﬂows (shown by the continuous line in
Figure 16.16).
Figure 16.16
The current ﬂowing in the load R is in the same
direction for both half-cycles of the input. The output
waveform is thus as shown in Figure 16.16. The output
is unidirectional, but is not constant; however, it is bet-
ter than the output waveform produced with a half-wave
rectiﬁer. Section 16.8 explains how the waveform may
be improved so as to be of more use.
A disadvantage of this type of rectiﬁer is that centre-
tapped transformers are expensive.
Full-wave bridge rectiﬁcation
Four diodes may be used in a bridge rectiﬁer circuit,
as shown in Figure 16.17, to obtain full-wave rectiﬁca-
tion. (Note, the term ‘bridge’ means a network of four
elements connected to form a square, the input being
applied to two opposite corners and the output being
taken from the remaining two corners.) As for the recti-
ﬁer shown in Figure 16.16, the current ﬂowing in load R
is in the same direction for both half cycles of the input
giving the output waveform shown.

Following the broken line in Figure 16.17:
When P is positive with respect to Q, current ﬂows from
the transformer to point E, through diode D 4 to point F,
then through load R to point H, through D 2 to point G,
and back to the transformer.
Following the full line in Figure 16.17:
When Q is positive with respect to P, current ﬂows from
the transformer to point G, through diode D 3 to point F,
then through load R to point H, through D 1 to point E,
and back to the transformer. The output waveform is not
steady and needs improving; a method of smoothing is
explained in the next section.
16.9 Smoothing of the rectiﬁed
output waveform
The pulsating outputs obtained from the half- and full-
wave rectiﬁer circuits are not suitable for the operation

Part 3
256
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
of equipment that requires a steady d.c. output, such
as would be obtained from batteries. For example, for
applications such as audio equipment, a supply with
a large variation is unacceptablesince it produces‘hum’
in the output. Smoothing is the process of removing the
worst of the output waveform variations.
To smooth out the pulsations a large capacitor, C, is
connected across the output of the rectiﬁer, as shown in
Figure 16.18; the effect of this is to maintain the output
voltage at a level which is very near to the peak of the
output waveform. The improved waveforms for half-
wave and full-wave rectiﬁers are shown in more detail
in Figure 16.19.
During each pulse of output voltage, the capacitor C
charges to the same potential as the peak of the wave-
form, as shown as point X in Figure 16.19. As the
waveform dies away, the capacitor discharges across
the load, as shown by XY. The output voltage is then
restored to the peak value the next time the rectiﬁer
conducts, as shown by YZ. This process continues as
shown in Figure 16.19.
Capacitor C is called a reservoir capacitor since
it stores and releases charge between the peaks of the
rectiﬁed waveform.
The variation in potential between points X and Y is
called ripple, as shown in Figure 16.19; the object is
to reduce ripple to a minimum. Ripple may be reduced
even further by the addition of inductance and another
capacitor in a ‘ﬁlter’ circuit arrangement, as shown in
Figure 16.20.

The output voltage from the rectiﬁer is applied to
capacitor C1 and the voltage across points AA is
shown in Figure 16.20, similar to the waveforms of
Figure 16.19. The load current ﬂows through the induc-
tance L; when current is changing, e.m.f.s are induced,
as explained in Chapter 11. By Lenz’s law, the induced
voltages will oppose those causing the current changes.
As the ripple voltage increases and the load current
increases, the induced e.m.f. in the inductor will oppose
the increase. As the ripple voltage falls and the load
current falls, the induced e.m.f. will try to maintain the
current ﬂow.
The voltage across points BB in Figure 16.20 and
the current in the inductance are almost ripple-free. A
further capacitor, C2, completes the process.

the CRO with a bridge rectiﬁer circuit, see the website.

Chapter 17
Single-phase series
a.c. circuits
Why it is important to understand: Single-phase series a.c. circuits
The analysis of basic a.c. electric circuits containing impedances and ideal a.c. supplies are presented
in this chapter. Series circuits containing pure resistance, R, pure inductance, L, and pure capacitance,
C, are initially explained. Then series R–L, R–C and R–L–C series circuits are explored using phasors
which greatly simpliﬁes the analysis. When capacitors or inductors are involved in an a.c. circuit, the
current and voltage do not peak at the same time. The fraction of a period difference between the peaks
expressed in degrees is said to be the phase difference. The phase difference is less than or equal to
90◦. Calculations of current, voltage, reactance, impedance and phase are explained via many worked
examples. The important phenomena of resonance are explored in an R–L–C series circuit – there are
many applications for this circuit – together with Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity. Resonance is used
in many different types of oscillator circuits; another important application is for tuning, such as in radio
receivers or television sets, where it is used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient
radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. Finally, power in a.c. circuits
is explained, together with the terms true power, apparent power, reactive power and power factor.
Single-phase series a.c. circuit theory is of great importance in electrical/electronic engineering.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
draw phasor diagrams and current and voltage waveforms for (a) purely resistive, (b) purely inductive and
(c) purely capacitive a.c. circuits
•
perform calculations involving XL =2πfL and XC =

•
draw circuit diagrams, phasor diagrams and voltage and impedance triangles for R–L, R–C and
R–L–C series a.c. circuits and perform calculations using Pythagoras’ theorem, trigonometric ratios and

17.4 R–L series a.c. circuit
In an a.c. circuit containing inductance L and resistance
R, the applied voltage V is the phasor sum of VR and
VL (see Figure 17.6), and thus the current I lags the
applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0◦and
90◦(depending on the values of VR and VL), shown as
angle φ. In any a.c. series circuit the current is common
to each component and is thus taken as the reference
phasor.

From the phasor diagram of Figure 17.6, the ‘voltage
triangle’ is derived.

greater than the supply voltage (see Figure 17.12(d)).

17.9 Bandwidth and selectivity
Figure 17.22shows how current I varies with frequency
in an R–L–C series circuit. At the resonant frequency
fr, current is a maximum value, shown as Ir. Also
shown are the points A and B where the current is 0.707
of the maximum value at frequencies f1 and f2. The
power delivered to the circuit is I 2R. At I =0.707Ir
the power is (0.707Ir)2R =0.5I 2
r R, i.e. half the power
that occurs at frequency fr. The points corresponding
to f1 and f2 are called the half-power points. The dis-
tance between these points, i.e. (f2 −f1), is called the
bandwidth.
It may be shown that
Q =
fr
f2 −f1
or ( f2 −f1) = fr
Q
(This formula is proved in Chapter 31, page 480–481)
Problem 23.

L–R–C circuit is designed to operate at a resonant
frequency of 5kHz. Included within the ﬁlter is a
Figure 17.22

the bandwidth of the ﬁlter.
Q-factor at resonance is given by
Qr = ωrL
R
= (2π5000)(20× 10−3)
10
= 62.83
Since Qr =fr/(f2 −f1)
bandwidth, (f2 −f1)= fr
Qr
= 5000
62.83 =79.6Hz
Selectivity is the ability of a circuit to respond more
readily to signals of a particular frequency to which it is
tuned than to signals of other frequencies. The response
becomes progressively weaker as the frequency departs
from the resonant frequency. The higher the Q-factor,
the narrower the bandwidthand the more selective is the
circuit. Circuits having high Q-factors (say, in the order
of 100 to 300) are therefore useful in communications
engineering. A high Q-factor in a series power circuit
has disadvantages in that it can lead to dangerously high
voltagesacrosstheinsulationandmayresultinelectrical
breakdown.
(For more on bandwidth and selectivity see Chapter 31,
pages 479–483)

17.10 Power in a.c. circuits
In Figures 17.23(a)–(c), the value of powerat any instant

(V and I being r.m.s. values).
See Figure 17.23(a). The unit ‘watt’ is named after

For a purely inductive a.c. circuit, the average

For a purely capacitive a.c. circuit, the average

Figure 17.24 shows current and voltage waveforms for
an R–L circuit where the current lags the voltage by
angle φ. The waveform for power (where p=vi) is
shown by the broken line, and its shape, and hence
average power depends on the value of angle φ.

Power dissipated, P =I 2R where I is the r.m.s. value

If i =250sinωt mA, then Im =0.250A and r.m.s. cur-
rent, I =(0.707×0.250)A.
Hence powerP =(0.707×0.250)2(5000)

Single-phase parallel
a.c. circuits
Why it is important to understand: Single-phase parallel a.c. circuits
The analysis of basic a.c. parallel electric circuits containing impedances and ideal a.c. supplies are
presented in this chapter. Parallel networks containing R–L, R–C, L–C and R–L–C parallel circuits are
explored using phasors, which greatly simpliﬁes the analysis. Calculations of current, voltage, reac-
tance, impedance and phase are explained via many worked examples. The important phenomena of
resonance are explored in an RL–C parallel circuit, together with Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity.
Resonance is used in many different types of oscillator and ﬁlter circuits. A method of power factor
improvement is explained. If a network is 100% efﬁcient, its power factor is 1 or unity. This is the
ideal for power transmission, but is practically impossible to attain. Variation in power factor is caused
by different types of electrical devices connected to the grid that consume or generate reactive power.
Unless this variation is corrected, higher currents are drawn from the grid, leading to grid instabil-
ity, higher costs and reduced transmission capacity. A poor power factor results in additional costs
for the electricity supplier. These costs are passed on to the customer as a ‘reactive power charge’
or ‘exceeded capacity charge’. All UK electricity suppliers impose a reactive penalty charge when
the average power factor falls below around 0.95. The causes of poor power factor include inductive
loads on equipment such as a.c. motors, arc welders, furnaces, ﬂuorescent lighting and air condition-
ing. The more inductive loads there are on the network, the greater the possibility there is of a poor
power factor. Single-phase parallel a.c. circuit theory is of great importance in electrical/electronic
engineering.

18.1 Introduction
In parallel circuits, such as those shown in Figures 18.1
and 18.2, the voltage is common to each branch of the
network and is thus taken as the reference phasor when
drawing phasor diagrams.
Figure 18.1
For any parallel a.c. circuit:
True or active power, P = VI cosφ watts (W)
or P = I 2
RR watts
Apparent power, S = VI voltamperes (VA)
Reactive power, Q = VI sinφ reactive
voltamperes (var)
Power factor =
true power
apparent power = P
S = cosφ
(These formulae are the same as for series a.c. circuits
as used in Chapter 17.)
18.2 R–L parallel a.c. circuit
In the two-branch parallel circuit containing resistance
R and inductance L shown in Figure 18.1, the current
ﬂowing in the resistance, IR, is in-phase with the supply
voltage V and the current ﬂowing in the inductance, IL,
lags the supply voltage by 90◦. The supply current I is
the phasor sum of IR and IL and thus the current I lags
the applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0◦and
90◦(depending on the values of IR and IL), shown as
angle φ in the phasor diagram.

18.5 LR –C parallel a.c. circuit
In the two-branch circuit containing capacitance C in
parallel with inductance L and resistance R in series
(such as a coil) shown in Figure 18.5(a), the phasor dia-
gram for the LR branch alone is shown in Figure 18.5(b)
and the phasor diagram for the C branch is shown alone
in Figure 18.5(c). Rotating each and superimposing on
one another gives the complete phasor diagram shown
in Figure 18.5(d).
The current ILR of Figure 18.5(d) may be resolved
into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal
component, shown as op, is ILR cosφ1 and the vertical
component, shown as pq, is ILR sinφ1. There are three
possible conditions for this circuit:
(i)
IC >ILR sinφ1 (giving a supply current I leading
V by angle φ – as shown in Figure 18.5(e))
(ii)
ILR sinφ1 >IC (giving I lagging V by angle φ –
as shown in Figure 18.5(f))
(iii)
IC =ILR sinφ1 (this is called parallel resonance,
see Section 18.6).
There are two methods of ﬁnding the phasor sum of
currents ILR and IC in Figures 18.5(e) and (f). These
are: (i) by a scaled phasor diagram, or (ii) by resolving
Figure 18.5

‘quadrature’ (i.e. vertical) components, as demon-

18.6 Parallel resonance and Q-factor
Parallel resonance
Resonance occurs in the two-branch network contain-
ing capacitance C in parallel with inductance L and
resistance R in series (see Figure 18.5(a)) when the
quadrature (i.e. vertical) component of current I LR is
equal to IC. At this condition the supply current I is
in-phase with the supply voltage V .
Resonant frequency
When the quadrature component of ILR is equal to IC
then: IC =ILR sinφ1 (see Figure 18.9)

Graphs of current and impedance against frequency
near to resonance for a parallel circuit are shown in
Figure 18.10, and are seen to be the reverse of those
in a series circuit (from page 270).
Rejector circuit
The parallel resonant circuit is often described as
a rejector circuit since it presents its maximum
impedance at the resonant frequency and the resultant
current is a minimum.
Mechanical analogy
Electrical resonance for the parallel circuit can be
likened to a mass hanging on a spring which, if pulled
down and released, will oscillate up and down but due to
friction the oscillations will slowly die. To maintain the
oscillation the mass would require a small force applied
each time it reaches its point of maximum travel and
this is exactly what happens with the electrical circuit.
A small current is required to overcome the losses and
maintain the oscillations of current. Figure 18.11 shows
the two cases.
Applications of resonance
One use for resonance is to establish a condition of
stable frequency in circuits designed to produce a.c.
signals. Usually, a parallel circuit is used for this pur-
pose, with the capacitor and inductor directly connected
together, exchangingenergy between each other. Just as
a pendulum can be used to stabilize the frequency of a
clock mechanism’s oscillations, so can a parallel circuit
be used to stabilize the electrical frequency of an a.c.
oscillator circuit.
Another use for resonance is inapplications where the
effects of greatly increased or decreased impedance at
a particular frequency is desired. A resonant circuit can
be used to ‘block’ (i.e. present high impedance towards)
a frequency or range of frequencies, thus acting as a sort
of frequency‘ﬁlter’ to strain certain frequenciesout of a
mix of others. In fact, these particular circuits are called
ﬁlters, and their design is considered in Chapter 45.
In essence, this is how analogue radio receiver tuner cir-
cuits work to ﬁlter, or select, one station frequency out
of the mix of different radio station frequency signals
intercepted by the antenna.
Q-factor
Currents higher than the supply current can circulate
within the parallel branches of a parallel resonant cir-
cuit, the current leaving the capacitor and establishing
the magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor, this then collapsing
and recharging the capacitor, and so on. The Q-factor
of a parallel resonant circuit is the ratio of the current
circulating in the parallel branches of the circuit to the
supply current, i.e. the current magniﬁcation.
Q-factor at resonance=current magniﬁcation

i.e.
Q-factor at resonance= 2πfrL

(which is the same as for a series circuit)
Note that in a parallel circuit the Q-factor is a measure
of current magniﬁcation, whereas in a series circuit it
is a measure of voltage magniﬁcation.
At mains frequencies the Q-factor of a parallel cir-
cuit is usually low, typically less than 10, but in
radio-frequency circuits the Q-factor can be very high.

18.7 Power factor improvement
From page 278, in any a.c. circuit, power factor =
cosφ, where φ is the phase angle between supplycurrent
and supply voltage.
Industrial loads such as a.c. motors are essentially
inductive (i.e. R–L) and may have a low power
factor.
For example, let a motor take a current of 50A at a
power factor of 0.6 lagging from a 240V, 50Hz supply,
as shown in the circuit diagram of Figure 18.14(a).
If power factor = 0.6 lagging, then:
cosφ = 0.6 lagging
Hence, phase angle, φ = cos−1 0.6 = 53.13◦lagging
Lagging means that I lags V (remember CIVIL), and
the phasor diagram is as shown in Figure 18.14(b).

V240V, 50Hz
IM50A
(b)
V 240 V
53.13

M
Figure 18.14
How can this power factor of 0.6 be ‘improved’ or
‘corrected’ to, say, unity?
Unity power factor means: cosφ = 1 from which, φ = 0
So how can the circuit of Figure 18.14(a) be modiﬁed
so that the circuit phase angle is changed from 53.13 ◦
to 0◦?
The answer is to connect a capacitor in parallel with
the motor as shown in Figure 18.15(a). When a capac-
itor is connected in parallel with the inductive load, it
takes a current shown as IC. In the phasor diagram of
Figure 18.15(b),current IC is shown leading the voltage
V by 90◦(again, remember CIVIL).

The supply current in Figure 18.15(a) is shown as I and

In the phasor diagram of Figure 18.15(b), current I is
shown as the phasor sum of IM and IC and is in phase
with V , i.e. the circuit phase angle is 0◦, which means
that the power factor is cos0◦= 1
Thus, by connecting a capacitor in parallel with the
motor, the power factor has been improved from 0.6
lagging to unity.
From right-angle triangles,
cos53.13◦=
adjacent
hypotenuse = I
50
from which, supply current,
I = 50cos53.13◦= 30A
Before the capacitor was connected, the supply
current was 50A. Now it is 30A.
Herein lies the advantage of power factor improve-
ment – the supply current has been reduced.
When power factor is improved, the supply current
is reduced, the supply system has lower losses (i.e.
lower I 2R losses) and therefore cheaper running
costs.

Problem 13.
A motor has an output of 4.8kW, an
efﬁciency of 80% and a power factor of 0.625
lagging when operated from a 240V, 50Hz supply.
It is required to improve the power factor to 0.95
lagging by connecting a capacitor in parallel with
the motor. Determine (a) the current taken by the
motor, (b) the supply current after power factor
correction, (c) the current taken by the capacitor,
(d) the capacitance of the capacitor and (e) the kvar
rating of the capacitor.
(a)
Efﬁciency= power output
power input
hence 80
100 =
4800
power input
Power input= 4800
0.8 =6000W
Hence, 6000=VI M cosφ =(240)(IM)(0.625),
since cosφ =p.f.=0.625
Thus current taken by the motor,
IM =
6000
(240)(0.625) = 40A
The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 18.19(a).
Figure 18.19
The phase angle between IM and V is given by:
φ = cos−1 0.625=51.32◦, hence the phasor dia-
gram is as shown in Figure 18.19(b).
(b)
When a capacitor C is connected in parallel with
the motor a current IC ﬂows which leads V by
90◦. The phasor sum of IM and IC gives the sup-
ply current I, and has to be such as to change the
circuit power factor to 0.95 lagging, i.e. a phase
angle of cos−10.95 or 18.19◦lagging, as shown in
Figure 18.19(c).
The horizontal component of IM (shown as 0a)

The horizontal component of I (also given by 0a)
= I cos18.19◦

Equating the horizontal components gives:

A 250V, 50Hz single-phase supply
feeds the following loads: (i) incandescent lamps
taking a current of 10A at unity power factor, (ii)
ﬂuorescent lamps taking 8A at a power factor of
0.7 lagging, (iii) a 3kVA motor operating at full

A phasor diagram is constructed as shown in

Chapter 19
D.c. transients
Why it is important to understand: D.c. transients
The study of transient and steady state responses of a circuit is very important as they form the building
blocks of most electrical circuits. This chapter explores the response of capacitors and inductors to sudden
changes in d.c. voltage,called a transient voltage,when connected in series with a resistor.Unlike resistors,
which respond instantaneously to applied voltage,capacitorsand inductors reactover time as they absorb
and release energy. Each time a switch is made or an input is connected, circuit conditions change, but
only for a short time; during these brief transient events, components and circuits may behave differently
to the way they behave under normal ’static’ conditions. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change
instantaneously as some time is required for the electric charge to build up on, or leave the capacitor
plates. Series R–C networks have many practical uses. They are often used in timing circuits to control
events that must happen repeatedly at a ﬁxed time interval. One example is a circuit that causes an LED
to blink on and off once every second. There are several ways to design a circuit to do this, but one of
the most common ways uses a series R–C circuit. By adjusting the value of the resistor or the capacitor,
the designer can cause the LED to blink faster or slower. An understanding of d.c. transients is thus
important and these are explained in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
understand the term ‘transient’
•
describe the transient response of capacitor and resistor voltages, and current in a series C–R d.c. circuit

D.c. transients

19.1 Introduction
When a d.c. voltage is applied to a capacitor C and
resistor R connected in series, there is a short period of
time immediately after the voltage is connected, during
which the current ﬂowing in the circuit and voltages
across C and R are changing.
Similarly, when a d.c. voltage is connectedto a circuit
having inductance L connected in series with resistance
R, there is a short period of time immediately after the
voltage is connected, during which the current ﬂow-
ing in the circuit and the voltages across L and R are
changing.
These changing values are called transients.
19.2 Charging a capacitor
(a)
The circuit diagram for a series-connected C–R
circuit is shown in Figure 19.1. When switch S is
closed then by Kirchhoff’s voltage law:
V = vC + vR
(1)
Figure 19.1
(b)
The battery voltage V is constant. The capacitor
voltage vC is given by q/C, where q is the charge
on the capacitor. The voltage dropacross Ris given
by iR, where i is the current ﬂowing in the circuit.
Hence at all times:
V = q
C + iR
(2)
AttheinstantofclosingS(initialcircuitcondition),
assumingthere is no initial chargeon the capacitor,
q0 is zero, hence vCo is zero. Thus from equa-
tion (1), V =0 + vRo, i.e. vRo = V . This shows that
the resistance to current is solely due to R, and the
initial current ﬂowing, io =I =V/R
(c)
A short time later at time t1 seconds after clos-
ing S, the capacitor is partly charged to, say,
q1 coulombs because current has been ﬂowing.
The voltage vC1 is now q1/C volts. If the current
ﬂowing is i1 amperes, then the voltage drop across
R has fallen to i1R volts. Thus, equation (2) is
now V =(q1/C) + i1R
(d)
A short time later still, say at time t2 seconds after
closing the switch, the charge has increased to q2
coulombsand vC has increased to q2/C volts. Since
V =vC + vR andV isaconstant,thenvR decreases
to i2R. Thus vC is increasing and i and vR are
decreasing as time increases.
(e)
Ultimately, a few seconds after closing S (i.e. at
the ﬁnal or steady state condition), the capacitor
is fully charged to, say, Q coulombs, current no
longer ﬂows, i.e. i =0, and hence vR =iR =0. It
follows from equation (1) that vC =V
(f)
Curves showing the changes in vC, vR and i with
time are shown in Figure 19.2.
The curve showing the variation of vC with
time is called an exponential growth curve and
the graph is called the ‘capacitor voltage/time’
characteristic. The curves showing the variation
of vR and i with time are called exponential
Figure 19.2

Part 3
296
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
decay curves, and the graphs are called ‘resistor
voltage/time’ and ‘current/time’ characteristics,
respectively. (The name ‘exponential’ shows that
the shape can be expressed mathematically by an
exponential mathematical equation, as shown in
Section 19.4.)
19.3 Time constant for a C–R circuit
(a)
If a constant d.c. voltage is applied to a series-
connected C–R circuit, a transient curve of capac-
itor voltage vC is as shown in Figure 19.2(a).
(b)
With referenceto Figure 19.3, let the constant volt-
age supply be replaced by a variable voltage supply
at time t1 seconds. Let the voltage be varied so that
the current ﬂowing in the circuit is constant.
Figure 19.3
(c)
Since the current ﬂowing is a constant, the curve
will follow a tangent, AB, drawn to the curve at
point A.
(d)
Let the capacitor voltage vC reach its ﬁnal value
of V at time t2 seconds.
(e)
The time corresponding to (t2 −t1) seconds is
called the time constant of the circuit, denoted
by the Greek letter ‘tau’, τ. The value of the time
constant is CR seconds, i.e. for a series connected
C–R circuit,
time constant τ = CR seconds
Since the variable voltage mentioned in para. (b)
above can be applied to any instant during the tran-
sient change, it may be applied at t =0, i.e. at the
instant of connecting the circuit to the supply. If
this is done, then the time constant of the circuit
may be deﬁned as:
‘the time taken for a transient to reach its ﬁnal state
if the initial rate of change is maintained’.
19.4 Transient curves for a C –R circuit
There are two main methods of drawing transient curves
graphically, these being:
(a)
the tangent method – this method is shown in
worked Problem 1 below and
(b)
the initial slope and three point method, which
is shown in worked Problem 2, and is based on
the following properties of a transient exponential
curve:
(i) for a growth curve, the value of a transient at a
time equal to one time constant is 0.632 of its
steady state value (usually taken as 63% of the
steady state value), at a time equal to two and
a half time constants is 0.918 of its steady state
value (usually taken as 92% of its steady state
value) and at a time equal to ﬁve time constants
is equal to its steady state value,
(ii) for a decay curve, the value of a transient at a
time equal to one time constant is 0.368 of its
initial value (usually taken as 37% of its initial
value), at a time equal to two and a half time
constants is 0.082 of its initial value (usually
taken as 8% of its initial value) and at a time
equal to ﬁve time constants is equal to zero.
The transient curves shown in Figure 19.2 have mathe-
matical equations, obtained by solving the differential
equations representing the circuit. The equations of the
curves are:
growth of capacitor voltage, v C =V(1 −e−t/CR)
=V(1 −e−t/τ )
decay of resistor voltage,
vR =Ve−t/CR
=Ve−t/τ and
decay of current ﬂowing,
i=Ie−t/CR = Ie−t/τ
These equations are derived analytically in Chapter 48.
Problem 1.
A 15μF uncharged capacitor is
connected in series with a 47k resistor across a
120V d.c. supply. Use the tangential graphical
method to draw the capacitor voltage/time
characteristic of the circuit. From the characteristic,
determine the capacitor voltage at a time equal to
one time constant after being connected to the
supply, and also two seconds after being connected
to the supply. Also, ﬁnd the time for the capacitor
voltage to reach one half of its steady state value.

Part 3
D.c. transients
297
To construct an exponential curve, the time constant of
the circuit and steady state value need to be determined.
Time constant = CR = 15μF × 47k
= 15 × 10−6 × 47 × 103
= 0.705s
Steady state value of vC = V,
i.e.
vC = 120V
With referenceto Figure 19.4,the scale of the horizontal
axis is drawn so that it spans at least ﬁve time constants,
i.e. 5 × 0.705 or about 3.5 seconds. The scale of the
vertical axis spans the change in the capacitor voltage,
that is, from 0 to 120V. A broken line AB is drawn
corresponding to the ﬁnal value of vC
Figure 19.4
Point C is measured along AB so that AC is equal
to 1τ, i.e. AC = 0.705s. Straight line 0C is drawn.
Assuming that aboutﬁve intermediatepoints are needed
to draw the curve accurately, a point D is selected on
0C corresponding to a vC value of about 20V. DE is
drawn vertically. EF is made to correspond to 1τ, i.e.
EF = 0.705s. A straight line is drawn joining DF. This
procedure of
(a)
drawing a vertical line through point selected,
(b)
at the steady state value, drawing a horizontal line
corresponding to 1τ, and
(c)
joining the ﬁrst and last points,
is repeated for vC values of 40, 60, 80 and 100V, giving
points G, H, I and J.
The capacitor voltage effectively reaches its steady
state value of 120V after a time equal to ﬁve time
constants, shown as point K. Drawing a smooth curve
through points O, D, G, H, I, J and K gives the
exponential growth curve of capacitor voltage.
From the graph, the value of capacitor voltage at a
time equal to the time constant is about 75V. It is a
characteristic of all exponential growth curves that after
a time equal to one time constant, the value of the tran-
sient is 0.632 of its steady state value. In this problem,
0.632 × 120 = 75.84V. Also from the graph, when
t is two seconds, vC is about 115V. [This value may
be checked using the equation vC(1 −e−t/τ), where
V = 120V, τ = 0.705s and t = 2s. This calculation
gives vC = 112.97V.]
The time for vC to rise to one half of its ﬁnal
value, i.e. 60V, can be determined from the graph
and is about 0.5s. [This value may be checked using
vC =V (1 −e−t/τ) where V =120V, vC =60V and
τ =0.705s, giving t =0.489s]
Problem 2.
A 4μF capacitor is charged to 24V
and then discharged through a 220k resistor. Use
the ‘initial slope and three point’ method to draw:
(a) the capacitor voltage/time characteristic, (b) the
resistor voltage/time characteristic and (c) the
current/time characteristic, for the transients which
occur. From the characteristics determine the value
of capacitor voltage, resistor voltage and current
one and a half seconds after discharge has started.
To draw the transient curves, the time constant of the
circuit and steady state values are needed.
Time constant, τ = CR = 4 × 10−6 × 220 × 103
= 0.88s
Initially, capacitor voltage vC = vR = 24V,
i = V
R =
24
220 × 103
= 0.109mA
Finally, vC =vR =i =0
(a)
The exponential decay of capacitor voltage is from
24V to 0V in a time equal to ﬁve time constants,
i.e. 5×0.88=4.4s. With reference to Figure 19.5,
to construct the decay curve:
(i)
the horizontal scale is made so that it spans
at least ﬁve time constants, i.e. 4.4s,
(ii)
theverticalscaleismadetospanthechange
in capacitor voltage, i.e. 0 to 24V,
(iii)
point A corresponds to the initial capacitor
voltage, i.e. 24V,

Part 3

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(iv)
0B is made equal to one time constant and
line AB is drawn. This gives the initial slope
of the transient,
(v)
the value of the transient after a time equal
to one time constant is 0.368 of the initial
value, i.e. 0.368×24=8.83V; a vertical
line is drawn through B and distance BC
is made equal to 8.83V,
(vi)
the value of the transient after a time equal
to two and a half time constants is 0.082 of
the initial value, i.e. 0.082×24=1.97V,
shown as point D in Figure 19.5,
Figure 19.5
(vii)
the transient effectively dies away to zero
after a time equal to ﬁve time constants,
i.e. 4.4s, giving point E.
The smooth curve drawn through points A, C,
D and E represents the decay transient. At 1 1
2 s
after decay has started, vC ≈4.4V. [This may be
checked using vC =V e−t/τ, where V =24, t =1 1
2
and τ =0.88, giving vC =4.36V]
(b)
The voltage drop across the resistor is equal to
the capacitor voltage when a capacitor is dischar-
ging through a resistor, thus the resistor voltage/
time characteristic is identical to that shown in
Figure 19.5.
Since vR =vC, then at 1 1
2 seconds after decay has
started, vR ≈4.4V (see (vii) above).
(c)
The current/time characteristic is constructed in
the same way as the capacitor voltage/time
characteristic, shown in part (a) of this problem,
and is as shown in Figure 19.6. The values are:
point A: initial value of current=0.109mA
point C: at 1τ, i =0.368×0.109=0.040mA
point D: at 2.5τ, i =0.082×0.109=0.009mA
point E: at 5τ, i =0
Figure 19.6
Hence the current transient is as shown. At a time
of 1 1
2 seconds, the value of current, from the char-
acteristic is 0.02mA. [This may be checked using
i =Ie−t/τ where I =0.109, t =1 1
2 and τ =0.88,
giving i =0.0198mA or 19.8μA]

19.5 Discharging a capacitor
When a capacitor is charged (i.e. with the switch in pos-
ition A in Figure 19.7), and the switch is then moved to
position B, the electrons stored in the capacitor keep the
current ﬂowing for a short time. Initially, at the instant
of moving from A to B, the current ﬂow is such that
the capacitor voltage vC is balanced by an equal and
opposite voltage vR =iR. Since initially vC =vR =V ,
then i =I =V/R. During the transient decay, by apply-
ing Kirchhoff’s voltage law to Figure 19.7, vC =vR.
Finally the transients decay exponentially to zero,
i.e. vC =vR =0. The transient curves representing the
voltages and current are as shown in Figure 19.8.
Figure 19.7
Figure 19.8
The equations representing the transient curves during
the discharge period of a series-connected C–R circuit
are:
decay of voltage, vC =vR =Ve(−t/CR)= Ve(−t/τ)
decay of current,
i=Ie(−t/CR) = Ie(−t/τ)
Whenacapacitorhasbeendisconnectedfromthesup-
ply it may still be charged and it may retain this charge
for some considerable time. Thus precautions must be
taken to ensure that the capacitor is automatically dis-
charged after the supply is switched off. This is done
by connecting a high-value resistor across the capacitor
terminals.
Problem 6.
A capacitor is charged to 100V and
then discharged through a 50k resistor. If the
time constant of the circuit is 0.8s, determine:
(a) the value of the capacitor, (b) the time for the
capacitor voltage to fall to 20V, (c) the current
ﬂowing when the capacitor has been discharging
for 0.5s, and (d) the voltage drop across the resistor
when the capacitor has been discharging for one
second.
Parts (b), (c) and (d) of this problem may be solved
graphically, as shown in worked Problems 1 and 2 or by
calculation as shown below.

19.6 Camera ﬂash
The internal workings of a camera ﬂash are an example
of the application of C–R circuits. When a camera is
ﬁrst switched on, a battery slowly charges a capacitor to
its full potential via a C–R circuit. When the capacitor
is fully charged, an indicator (red light) typically lets
the photographer know that the ﬂash is ready for use.
Pressing the shutter button quickly discharges the
capacitor through the ﬂash (i.e. a resistor). The current
from the capacitor is responsible for the bright light
that is emitted. The ﬂash rapidly draws current in order
to emit the bright light. The capacitor must then be
discharged before the ﬂash can be used again.
19.7 Current growth in an L –R circuit
(a)
The circuit diagram for a series-connected L–R
circuit is shown in Figure 19.10. When switch S is
closed, then by Kirchhoff’s voltage law:
V = vL + vR
(3)
Figure 19.10
(b)
The battery voltage V is constant. The voltage
across the inductance is the induced voltage, i.e.
vL = L × change of current
change of time
= Ldi
dt
The voltage drop across R, vR is given by iR.
Hence, at all times:
V = L(di/dt) + iR
(4)
(c)
At the instant of closing the switch, the rate
of change of current is such that it induces an
e.m.f. in the inductance which is equal and oppo-
site to V , hence V = vL + 0, i.e. vL = V . From
equation (3), because vL =V , then vR = 0 and
i =0.
(d)
A short time later at time t1 seconds after clos-
ing S, current i1 is ﬂowing since there is a rate
of change of current initially, resulting in a volt-
age drop of i1R across the resistor. Since V
(constant)=vL +vR the induced e.m.f. is reduced,
and equation (4) becomes:
V = Ldi1
dt1
+ i1R
(e)
A short time later still, say at time t2 seconds after
closing the switch, the currentﬂowing is i2, and the
voltage drop across the resistor increases to i2R.
Since vR increases, vL decreases.
(f)
Ultimately, a few seconds after closing S, the
current ﬂow is entirely limited by R, the rate of
change of current is zeroandhencevLis zero. Thus

Part 3
D.c. transients
303
V =iR. Under these conditions, steady state cur-
rent ﬂows, usually signiﬁed by I. Thus, I =V/R,
vR =IR and vL =0 at steady state conditions.
(g)
Curves showing the changes in vL, vR and i with
time are shown in Figure 19.11 and indicate that
vL is a maximum value initially (i.e equal to V ),
decaying exponentially to zero, whereas vR and i
grow exponentially from zero to their steady state
values of V and I =V/R, respectively.

19.8 Time constant for an L –R circuit
With reference to Section 19.3, the time constant of a
series-connected L–R circuit is deﬁned in the same way
as the time constant for a series-connected C–R circuit,
i.e. it is the time taken to reach its ﬁnal value if the initial
rate of change is maintained. Its value is given by:
time constant, τ =L/R seconds
19.9 Transient curves for an L–R
circuit
Transient curves representing the induced voltage/time,
resistor voltage/time and current/time characteristics
may be drawngraphically,as outlinedin Section 19.4.A
method of construction is shown in worked Problem 8.
Each of the transient curves shown in Figure 19.11 have
mathematical equations, and these are:
decay of induced voltage, vL = Ve(−Rt/L) = Ve(−t/τ)
growth of resistor voltage, vR =V(1 −e−Rt/L)
=V(1 −e−t/τ )
growth of current ﬂow,
i=I(1 −e−Rt/L)
= I(1 −e−t/τ )
These equations are derived analytically in Chapter 48.
The application of these equations is shown in worked
Problem 10.
Problem 8.
A relay has an inductance of 100mH
and a resistance of 20. It is connected to a 60V
d.c. supply. Use the ‘initial slope and three point’
method to draw the current/time characteristic and
hence determine the value of current ﬂowing at a
time equal to two time constants and the time for
the current to grow to 1.5A.
Before the current/time characteristic can be drawn, the
time constant and steady state value of the current have
to be calculated.

Final value of current, I = V
R = 60
20 = 3A
The method used to construct the characteristic is the
same as that used in worked Problem 2.
(a)
The scales should span at least ﬁve time constants
(horizontally), i.e. 25ms, and 3A (vertically).
(b)
With reference to Figure 19.12, the initial slope is
obtained by making AB equal to 1 time constant,
(5ms), and joining 0B.

At a time of 2.5 time constants, EF is

At a time of 5 time constants, GH=3A

The expected time for the current to rise to
within 1% of its ﬁnal value is given by 5τ s, i.e.

Problem 10.
The winding of an electromagnet
has an inductance of 3H and a resistance of 15.
When it is connected to a 120V d.c. supply,
calculate:
(a)
the steady state value of current ﬂowing in the
winding,
(b)
the time constant of the circuit,
(c)
the value of the induced e.m.f. after 0.1s,
(d)
the time for the current to rise to 85% of its
ﬁnal value and
(e)
the value of the current after 0.3s
(a)
The steady state value of current is I =V/R, i.e.
I =120/15=8A
(b)
The time constant of the circuit,
τ =L/R =3/15= 0.2s
Parts (c), (d) and (e) of this problem may be deter-
mined by drawing the transients graphically, as shown
in worked Problem 7 or by calculation as shown
below.
(c)
The induced e.m.f., vL is given by vL =V e−t/τ
The d.c. voltage V is 120V, t is 0.1s and τ is 0.2s,
hence
vL = 120e−0.1/0.2 =120e−0.5 = 120× 0.6065
i.e. vL = 72.78V
(d)
When the current is 85% ofits ﬁnalvalue,i=0.85I.
Also, i =I(1−e−t/τ), thus 0.85I = I(1 −e−t/τ)
0.85 = 1 −e−t/τ and since τ = 0.2,
0.85 = 1 −e−t/0.2
e−t/0.2 = 1 −0.85 = 0.15
et/0.2 =

0.15 = 6.˙6
Taking natural logarithms of each side of this

t = 0.2 ln6.˙6 i.e. t = 0.379s

i.e. i = 6.215A
19.10 Current decay in an L –R circuit
When a series-connected L–R circuit is connected
to a d.c. supply as shown with S in position A of
Figure 19.13, a current I =V/R ﬂows after a short time,
creating a magnetic ﬁeld (∝I) associated with the
inductor. When S is moved to position B, the current
value decreases,causing a decrease in the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld. Flux linkages occur,generatinga voltage
vL, equal to L(di/dt). By Lenz’s law, this voltage keeps
current i ﬂowing in the circuit, its value being limited by
R. Since V = vL + vR,0 = vL + vR and vL = −vR, i.e.
vL and vR are equal in magnitude but opposite in direc-
tion. The current decays exponentially to zero and since
vR is proportional to the current ﬂowing, vR decays
exponentially to zero. Since vL =vR, vL also decays
exponentially to zero. The curves representing these
transients are similar to those shown in Figure 19.8.

Problem 11.
The ﬁeld winding of a 110V d.c.
motor has a resistance of 15 and a time constant
of 2s. Determine the inductance and use the
tangential method to draw the current/time
characteristic when the supply is removed and
replaced by a shorting link. From the characteristic,
determine (a) the current ﬂowing in the winding 3s
after being shorted-out and (b) the time for the
current to decay to 5A.
Since the time constant, τ = L
R ,
L = Rτ
i.e. inductance L = 15 × 2 = 30H
The current/time characteristic is constructed in a similar
way to that used in worked Problem 1.
(i)
The scales should span at least ﬁve time constants
horizontally, i.e. 10s, and
I =V/R =110/15=7.˙3A vertically.
(ii)
With reference to Figure 19.14, the initial slope is
obtained by making 0B equal to 1 time constant,
(2s), and joining AB.
(iii)
At, say, i =6A, let C be the point on AB corre-
sponding to a current of 6A. Make DE equal to
1 time constant (2s) and join CE.

ues of, say, 4A, 2A and 1A, giving points F, G
and H.

(a) From the current/time characteristic, when
t =3s, i =1.5A. [This may be checked by
calculation using i =Ie−t/τ, where I =7.˙3,
t =3 and τ =2, giving i =1.64A] The
discrepancy between the two results is due
to relatively few values, such as C, F, G and
H, being taken.

t=0.70s.
[This

calculation using i =Ie−t/τ, where i =5,
I =7.˙3, τ =2, giving t =0.766s.] Again,
the discrepancy between the graphical and

values, such as C, F, G and H, being taken.

19.11 Switching inductive circuits
Energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of an inductor exists
because a current provides the magnetic ﬁeld. When the
d.c. supply is switched off the current falls rapidly, the
magnetic ﬁeld collapses causing a large induced e.m.f.
which will either cause an arc across the switch contacts
or will break down the insulation between adjacent turns
of the coil. The high induced e.m.f. acts in a direction
which tends to keep the current ﬂowing, i.e. in the same
direction as the applied voltage. The energy from the
magnetic ﬁeld will thus be aided by the supply voltage
in maintaining an arc, which could cause severe dam-
age to the switch. To reduce the induced e.m.f. when
the supply switch is opened, a discharge resistor RD
is connected in parallel with the inductor as shown in
Figure 19.16. The magnetic ﬁeld energy is dissipated as
heat in RD and R and arcing at the switch contacts is
avoided.

Since the change in capacitor voltage is from+E to −E,
the change in discharge current is 2E/R, resulting in a

Operational ampliﬁers
Why it is important to understand: Operational ampliﬁers
The term operational ampliﬁer, abbreviated to op amp, was coined in the 1940s to refer to a special kind
of ampliﬁer that, by proper selection of external components, could be conﬁgured to perform a variety
of mathematical operations. Early op amps were made from vacuum tubes consuming lots of space and
energy. Later op amps were made smaller by implementing them with discrete transistors. Today, op
amps are monolithic integrated circuits, highly efﬁcient and cost effective. Operational ampliﬁers can
be used to perform mathematical operations on voltage signals such as inversion, addition, subtraction,
integration, differentiation and multiplication by a constant. The op amp is one of the most useful and
important components of analogue electronics and they are widely used. This chapter explains the main
properties of op amps and explains the principle of operation of the inverter, non-inverter, voltagefollower,
summing, voltage comparator, integrator and differentiator op amps. In addition digital to analogue and
analogue to digital conversions are explained.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

20.1 Introduction to operational
ampliﬁers
Operational ampliﬁers (usually called ‘op amps’)
were originally made from discrete components, being
designed to solve mathematical equations electroni-
cally, by performing operations such as addition and
division in analogue computers. Now produced in
integrated-circuit (IC) form, op amps have many uses,
with one of the most important being as a high-gain d.c.
and a.c. voltage ampliﬁer.
The main properties of an op amp include:
(i)
a very high open-loop voltage gain A o of around
105 for d.c. and low frequency a.c., which
decreases with frequency increase
(ii)
a very high input impedance, typically 10 6 to
1012 ,suchthatcurrentdrawnfromthedevice,or
the circuit supplying it, is very small and the input
voltage is passed on to the op amp with little loss
(iii)
a very low output impedance, around 100, such
that its output voltage is transferred efﬁciently to
any load greater than a few kilohms
The circuit diagram symbol for an op amp is shown in
Figure 20.1. It has one output, V o, and two inputs; the
inverting input, V1, is marked −and thenon-inverting
input, V2, is marked +
The operation of an op amp is most convenient
from a dual balanced d.c. power supply±VS (i.e.+VS,
0,−VS); the centre point of the supply, i.e. 0V, is
common to the input and output circuits and is taken
as their voltage reference level. The power supply
connections are not usually shown in a circuit diagram.
An op amp is basically a differential voltage ampli-
ﬁer, i.e. it ampliﬁes the difference between input
voltages V1 and V2. Three situations are possible:
(i)
if V2 >V1, Vo is positive
(ii)
if V2 <V1, Vo is negative
(iii)
if V2 =V1, Vo is zero.

Problem 1.
A differential ampliﬁer has an
open-loop voltage gain of 120. The input signals are
2.45 V and 2.35 V. Calculate the output voltage of
the ampliﬁer.
From equation (1), output voltage,
Vo = Ao(V2 −V1) = 120(2.45 −2.35)
= (120)(0.1) = 12 V
Transfer characteristic
A typical voltage characteristic showing how the out-
put Vo varies with the input (V2 −V1) is shown in

Figure 20.2
It is seen from Figure 20.2 that only within the very
small input range P0Q is the outputdirectly proportional
to the input; it is in this range that the op amp behaves
linearly and there is minimumdistortion of the ampliﬁer
output. Inputs outside the linear range cause saturation
and the output is then close to the maximum value, i.e.
+VS or −VS. The limited linear behaviour is due to the
very high open-loop gain Ao, and the higher it is the
greater is the limitation.

Part 3
Operational ampliﬁers
311
Negative feedback
Operational ampliﬁers nearly always use negative
feedback, obtained by feeding back some, or all, of
the output to the inverting (−) input (as shown in
Figure 20.5 later). The feedback produces an output
voltage that opposes the one from which it is taken. This
reduces the new output of the ampliﬁer and the resulting
closed-loop gain A is then less than the open-loop gain
Ao. However, as a result, a wider range of voltages can
be applied to the input for ampliﬁcation. As long as
Ao >>A, negative feedback gives:
(i)
a
constant
and predictable voltage
gain A,
(ii) reduced distortion of the output, and (iii) better
frequency response.
The advantages of using negative feedback outweigh
the accompanyingloss of gain which is easily increased
by using two or more op amp stages.
Bandwidth
The open-loop voltage gain of an op amp is not constant
at all frequencies; because of capacitive effects it falls at
high frequencies.Figure 20.3 shows the gain/bandwidth
characteristic of a 741 op amp. At frequencies below
10Hz the gain is constant, but at higher frequencies the
gain falls at a constant rate of 6dB/octave (equivalent to
a rate of 20dB per decade) to 0dB
The gain-bandwidth product for any ampliﬁer is the
linear voltage gain multiplied by the bandwidth at that
gain.Thevalueoffrequencyatwhichtheopen-loopgain
has fallen to unity is called the transition frequency fT
fT = closed-loop voltage gain × bandwidth

In Figure 20.3, fT =106 Hz or 1MHz; a gain of 20 dB
(i.e. 20 log10 10) gives a 100kHz bandwidth, whilst a
gain of 80 dB (i.e. 20 log10 104) restricts the bandwidth
to 100Hz.
20.2 Some op amp parameters
Input bias current
The input bias current, IB, is the average of the currents
into the two input terminals with the output at zero
volts, which is typically around 80nA (i.e. 80×10 −9 A)
for a 741 op amp. The input bias current causes a volt
drop across the equivalent source impedance seen by
the op amp input.
Input offset current
The input offset current, Ios, of an op amp is the differ-
ence between the two input currents with the output at
zero volts. In a 741 op amp, Ios is typically 20 nA.
Input offset voltage
In the ideal op amp, with both inputs at zero there
should be zero output. Due to imbalances within the
ampliﬁer this is not always the case and a small output
voltage results. The effect can be nulliﬁed by applying
a small offset voltage, Vos, to the ampliﬁer. In a 741 op
amp, Vos is typically 1mV.
Common-mode rejection ratio
The output voltage of an op amp is proportional to the
difference between the voltages applied to its two input
terminals. Ideally, when the two voltages are equal, the
output voltages should be zero. A signal applied to both
input terminals is called a common-mode signal and it
is usually an unwanted noise voltage. The ability of an
op amp to suppress common-mode signals is expressed
in terms of its common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR),
which is deﬁned by:
CMRR = 20 log10
differential voltage gain

dB

In a 741 op amp, the CMRR is typically 90 dB.
The common-mode gain, Acom, is deﬁned as:

where Vcom is the common input signal

Slew rate
The slew rate of an op amp is the maximum rate of
change of output voltage following a step input volt-
age. Figure 20.4 shows the effects of slewing; it causes
the output voltage to change at a slower rate than the
input, such that the output waveform is a distortion of
the input waveform. 0.5V/μs is a typical value for the
slew rate.
20.3 Op amp inverting ampliﬁer
The basic circuit for an inverting ampliﬁer is shown in
Figure 20.5, where the input voltageVi (a.c. or d.c.) to be
ampliﬁed is applied via resistor Ri to the inverting (−)
terminal; the output voltage Vo is therefore in anti-phase

with the input. The non-inverting (+) terminal is held
at 0 V. Negative feedback is provided by the feedback
resistor, Rf , feeding back a certain fraction of the output
voltage to the inverting terminal.
Ampliﬁer gain
In an ideal op amp two assumptions are made, these
being that:
(i)
each input draws zero current from the signal
source, i.e. their input impedances are inﬁnite, and
(ii)
the inputs are both at the same potential if the op
amp is not saturated, i.e. VA =VB in Figure 20.5.
In Figure 20.5, VB =0, hence VA =0 and point X is
called a virtual earth.
Thus,I1 = Vi −0

and I2 = 0 −Vo

However, I1 = I2 from assumption (i) above.

the negative sign showing that Vo is negative when Vi
is positive, and vice versa.
The closed-loop gain A is given by:
A = Vo

Ri
(5)
This shows that the gain of the ampliﬁer depends only
on the two resistors, which can be made with precise
values, and not on the characteristics of the op amp,
which may vary from sample to sample.
For example, if Ri =10k and Rf =100k, then the
closed-loop gain,
A = −Rf
Ri
= −100 × 103
10 × 103
= −10
Thus an input of 100mV will cause an output change
of 1V.
Input impedance
Since point X is a virtual earth (i.e. at 0 V), Ri may
be considered to be connected between the inverting
(−) input terminal and 0 V. The input impedance of the
circuit is therefore Ri in parallel with the much greater
input impedance of the op amp, i.e. effectively R i. The
circuit input impedance can thus be controlled bysimply
changing the value of Ri
Problem 4.
In the inverting ampliﬁer of
Figure 20.5, Ri =1k and Rf =2k.
Determine the output voltage when the input
voltage is: (a) +0.4V, (b) −1.2V.

(a) the voltage gain, and (b) the output offset
voltage due to the input bias current. (c) How can
the effect of input bias current be minimized?

Hence, the offset voltage, Vos, at the input due to
the 100nA input bias current, IB, is given by:

(c)
The effect of input bias current can be minimized
by ensuring that both inputs ‘see’ the same driving
resistance. This means that a resistance of value
9.9k (from part (b)) should be placed between
the non-inverting (+) terminal and earth in
Figure 20.6.
Problem 6.
Design an inverting ampliﬁer to have
a voltage gain of 40dB, a closed-loop bandwidth of
5kHz and an input resistance of 10k.
The voltage gain of an op amp, in decibels, is given by:
gain in decibels=20log10 (voltage gain)
(from Chapter 12)
Hence
40=20log10 A
from which, 2=log10 A

20.4 Op amp non-inverting ampliﬁer
The basic circuit for a non-inverting ampliﬁer is shown
in Figure 20.8, where the input voltage Vi (a.c. or d.c.)
is applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the op
amp. This produces an output Vo that is in phase with
the input. Negative feedback is obtained by feeding
back to the inverting (−) terminal, the fraction of V o
developed across Ri in the voltage divider formed by
Rf and Ri across Vo
Ampliﬁer gain
In Figure 20.8, let the feedback factor,
β =

It may be shown that for an ampliﬁer with open-loop
gain Ao, the closed-loop voltage gain A is given by:
A =
Ao
1 + βAo
For a typical op amp, Ao =105, thus βAo is large com-
pared with 1, and the above expression approximates
to:
A= Ao

For example, if Ri =10k and Rf =100k,
then
A = 1 + 100 × 103
10 × 103 = 1 + 10 = 11
Again, the gain depends only on the values of Ri and
Rf and is independent of the open-loop gain A o
Input impedance
Since there is no virtual earth at the non-inverting (+)
terminal, the input impedance is much higher (typi-
cally 50M) than that of the inverting ampliﬁer. Also,
it is unaffected if the gain is altered by changing Rf
and/or Ri. This non-inverting ampliﬁer circuit gives
good matching when the input is supplied by a high
impedance source.

20.5 Op amp voltage-follower
The voltage-follower is a special case of the non-
inverting ampliﬁer in which 100% negative feedback is
obtained by connecting the output directly to the invert-
ing (−) terminal, as shown in Figure 20.10. Thus Rf in
Figure 20.8 is zero and Ri is inﬁnite.

Figure 20.10
From equation (6), A=1/β (when Ao is very large).
Since all of the output is fed back, β =1 and A≈1. Thus
the voltage gain is nearly 1 and Vo =Vi to within a few
millivolts.
The circuit of Figure 20.10 is called a voltage-
follower since, as with its transistor emitter-follower
equivalent, Vo follows Vi. It has an extremely high input
impedance and a low output impedance. Its main use
is as a buffer ampliﬁer, giving current ampliﬁcation,
to match a high impedance source to a low impedance
load. For example, it is used as the input stage of an
analogue voltmeter where the highest possible input
impedance is required so as not to disturb the circuit
under test; the output voltage is measured by a relatively
low impedance moving-coil meter.
20.6 Op amp summing ampliﬁer
Because of the existence of the virtual earth point, an
op amp can be used to add a number of voltages (d.c. or
a.c.) when connected as a multi-input inverting ampli-
ﬁer. This, in turn, is a consequence of the high value
of the open-loop voltage gain Ao. Such circuits may
be used as ‘mixers’ in audio systems to combine the
outputs of microphones, electric guitars, pick-ups, etc.
They are also used to perform the mathematical process
of addition in analogue computing.
The circuit of an op amp summing ampliﬁer having
three input voltages V1, V2 and V3 applied via input
resistors R1, R2 and R3 is shown in Figure 20.11. If it is
assumed that the inverting (−) terminal of the op amp

draws no input current, all of it passing through Rf ,
then:

Since X is a virtual earth (i.e. at 0V), it follows that:

(8)
The three input voltages are thus added and ampliﬁed if
Rf is greater than each of the input resistors; ‘weighted’
summation is said to have occurred.
Alternatively, the input voltages are added and attenu-
ated if Rf is less than each input resistor.
For example, if
Rf
R1 =4,
Rf
R2 =3 and
Rf

V1 =V2 =V3=+1V, then

If R1 =R2 =R3 =Ri, the input voltages are ampliﬁed
or attenuated equally, and
Vo = −Rf
Ri
(V1 + V2 + V3)
If, also, Ri =Rf then Vo =−(V1 +V2 +V3)
The virtual earth is also called the summing point of
the ampliﬁer. It isolates the inputs from one another so
that each behaves as if none of the others existed and
none feeds any of the other inputs even though all the
resistors are connected at the inverting (−) input.

20.7 Op amp voltage comparator
If both inputs of the op amp shown in Figure 20.13 are

the output voltage is given by:

When V2 >V1 then Vo is positive, its maximum value
being the positive supply voltage +Vs, which it has
when (V2 −V1)≥Vs/Ao. The op amp is then saturated.
For example, if Vs =+9V and Ao =105, then saturation

occurs when (V2−V1)≥9/105 i.e. when V2 exceeds V1
by 90μV and Vo ≈9V.
When V1 >V2, then Vo is negativeand saturation occurs
if V1 exceeds V2 by Vs/Ao i.e. around 90μV in the above
example; in this case, Vo ≈−Vs =−9V
A small change in (V2 −V1) therefore causes Vo to
switch between near +Vs and near to −Vs and enables
the op amp to indicate when V2 is greater or less than
V1, i.e. to act as a differential ampliﬁer and com-
pare two voltages. It does this in an electronic digital
voltmeter.

Resistor R and the light-dependent resistor (LDR)
form a voltage divider across the +15/0/−15V sup-
ply. The op amp compares the voltage V1 at the voltage
divider junction, i.e. at the inverting (−) input, with that
at the non-inverting(+) input, i.e. with V2, which is 0V.
In the dark the resistance of the LDR is much greater
than that of R, so more of the 30V across the volt-
age divider is dropped across the LDR, causing V1 to
fall below 0V. Now V2 >V1 and the output voltage Vo
switches from near −15V to near +15V and the light
emitting diode (LED) lights.
20.8 Op amp integrator
The circuit for the op amp integrator shown in Figure
20.15 is the same as for the op amp inverting ampli-
ﬁer shown in Figure 20.5, but feedback occurs via a
capacitor, C, rather than via a resistor.

Since the inverting (−) input is used in Figure 20.15, V o
is negative if Vi is positive, and vice-versa, hence the
negative sign in equation (9).
SinceXisavirtualearthinFigure20.15,i.e.at0V,the
voltage across R is Vi and that across C is Vo. Assuming
again that none of the input current I enters the op amp
inverting (−) input, then all of current I ﬂows through
C and chargesit up. If Vi is constant,I will be a constant
value given by I =Vi/R. Capacitor C therefore charges
at a constant rate and the potential of the output side of
C (=Vo, since its input side is zero) charges so that the
feedback path absorbs I. If Q is the charge on C at time
t and the p.d. across it (i.e. the output voltage) changes
from 0 to Vo in that time then:

20.9 Op amp differential ampliﬁer
The circuit for an op amp differential ampliﬁer is shown
in Figure 20.17 where voltages V1 and V2 are applied to
its two input terminals and the difference between these
voltages is ampliﬁed.
(i)
Let V1 volts be applied to terminal 1 and 0V be
applied to terminal 2. The difference in the poten-
tials at the inverting (−) and non-inverting (+)
op amp inputs is practically zero and hence the
inverting terminal must be at zero potential. Then
I1 =V1/R1. Since the op amp input resistance
is high, this current ﬂows through the feedback
resistor Rf . The volt drop across Rf , which is
the output voltage Vo =(V1/R1)Rf ; hence, the
closed-loop voltage gain A is given by:
A = Vo

(ii)
By similar reasoning, if V2 is applied to termi-
nal 2 and 0V to terminal 1, then the voltage
appearing at the non-inverting terminal will be
(R3/(R2 +R3))V2 volts. This voltage will also
appear at the inverting (−) terminal and thus the
voltage across R1 is equal to −(R3/(R2 + R3))V2
volts.

20.10 Digital to analogue (D/A)
conversion
There are a number of situations when digital signals
have to be converted to analogue ones. For example, a
digital computer often needs to produce a graphical dis-
play on the screen; this involves using a D/A converter
to change the two-level digital output voltage from the
computer into a continuously varying analogue voltage
for the input to the oscilloscope so that it can deﬂect the
electron beam to produce screen graphics.
A binary weighted resistor D/A converter is shown
in Figure 20.22 for a four-bit input. The values of the
resistors, R, 2R, 4R, 8R increase according to the binary
scale – hence the name of the converter. The circuit
uses an op amp as a summing ampliﬁer (see Section
20.6) with a feedback resistor Rf . Digitally controlled
electronic switches are shown as S1 to S4. Each switch
connects the resistor in series with it to a ﬁxed reference
voltage Vref when the input bit controlling it is a 1 and
to ground (0V) when it is a 0. The input voltages V 1 to
V4 applied to the op amp by the four-bit input via the
resistors thereforehave one of two values, i.e. either Vref
or 0 V.
From equation (8), page 316, the analogue output
voltage Vo is given by:
Vo = −

2R V2 + Rf

With a four-bit input of 0001 (i.e. decimal 1), S4
connects 8R to Vref, i.e. V4 =Vref, and S1, S2 and S3
connect R, 2R and 4R to 0V, making V1=V2 =V3 =0.
Let Vref =−8V, then output voltage,
Vo = −

With a four-bit input of 0101 (i.e. decimal 5), S2 and
S4 connects 2R and 4R to Vref, i.e. V2 =V4 =Vref, and
S1 and S3 connect R and 4R to 0V, making V1=V3 =0.
Again, if Vref =−8V, then output voltage,
Vo = −

0 + 1

If the input is 0111 (i.e. decimal 7), the output volt-
age will be 7V, and so on. From these examples, it is
seen that the analogue output voltage, Vo, is directly
proportional to the digital input.
Vo has a ‘stepped’ waveform, the waveform shape
depending on the binary input. A typical waveform is
shown in Figure 20.23.

is again used, in this case as a voltage comparator (see
Section 20.7). The analogue input voltage V 2, shown in
Figure 20.25(a) as a steady d.c. voltage, is applied to
the non-inverting (+) input, whilst a sawtooth voltage
V1 supplies the inverting (−) input.
The output from the comparator is applied to one
input of an AND gate and is a 1 (i.e. ‘high’) until V1
equals or exceeds V2, when it then goes to 0 (i.e. ‘low’)
as shown in Figure 20.25(b). The otherinput of the AND
gate is fed by a steady train of pulses from a pulse gen-
erator, as shown in Figure 20.25(c). When both inputs
to the AND gate are ‘high’, the gate ‘opens’ and gives a
‘high’ output, i.e. a pulse, as shown in Figure 20.25(d).
The time taken by V1 to reach V2 is proportional to
the analogue voltage if the ramp is linear. The output
pulses from the AND gate are recorded by a binary
counter and, as shown in Figure 20.25(e), are the digital
equivalent of the analogue input voltage V2. In prac-
tice, the ramp generator is a D/A converter which takes
its digital input from the binary counter, shown by the
broken lines in Figure 20.24. As the counter advances
through its normal binary sequence, a staircase wave-
formwithequalsteps(i.e.aramp)isbuiltupattheoutput
of the D/A converter (as shown by the ﬁrst few steps
in Figure 20.23).

Ways of generating
electricity – the present
and the future
Why it is important to understand: Ways of generating electricity - the present and the future
In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion – but it
took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the USA,
Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using
locally generated and distributed direct current electricity. The world’s ﬁrst public electricity supply was
provided in late 1881, when the streets of the Surrey town of Godalming in the UK were lit with electric
light. This system was powered from a water wheel on the River Wey, which drove a Siemens alternator
that supplied a number of arc lamps within the town.
In the 1920s the use of electricity for home lighting increased and by the mid-1930s electrical appliances
were standard in the homes of the better-off; after the Second World War they became common in all
households. Now, some 80 years later, we have become almost totally dependent on electricity! Without
electricity we have no lighting, no communication via mobile phones/smartphones, internet or computer,
television, iPods or radios, no air-conditioning, no fans, no electric heating, no refrigerator or freezer, no
coffee maker, no kitchen appliances, no dishwasher, no electric stoves, ovens or microwaves, no washing
machinesortumbledryers,problemswithdrinkingwaterifitcomesfromasystemdependentonelectrical
pumps, .... Our whole lifestyles have become totally dependent on a reliable electricity supply.
In the future, civilization will be forced to research and develop alternative energy sources. Our current
rate of fossil fuel usage will lead to an energy crisis this century. In order to survive the energy crisis
many companies in the energy industry are inventing new ways to extract energy from renewable sources
and while the rate of development is slow, mainstream awareness and government pressures are growing.
Traditional methods of generating electricity are unsustainable, and new energy sources must be found
that do not produce as much carbon. The recognized need for alternative power sources is not new.
Massive solar arrays are seen unveiled in vast deserts, enormous on-and-offshore wind-farms, wave-
beams converting the power of our oceans, and a host of biomass solutions arrive and disappear. One
of the most important of current engineering problems centres upon the realization that fossil fuels are
unsustainable, and therefore the challenge of how to generate enough electricity using clean, renewable
sources.

21.1 Introduction
In this chapter, methods of generating electricity using
coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydro power,
pumped storage, wind, tidal power, biomass and
solar energy are explained.
Coal, oil and gas are called ‘fossil fuels’ because they
have been formed from the organic remains of prehis-
toric plants and animals. Historically,the transitionfrom
one energy system to another, as from wood to coal
or coal to oil, has proven an enormously complicated
process, requiring decades to complete. In similar fash-
ion, it will be many years before renewable forms of
energy – wind, solar, tidal, geothermal and others still in
development– replacefossil fuels as the world’s leading
energy providers. This chapter explains some ways of
generating electricity for the present and for the future.
21.2 Generating electrical power
using coal
A coal power station turns the chemical energy in coal
into electrical energy that can be used in homes and
businesses.
In Figure 21.1, the coal (1) is ground to a ﬁne powder
and blown into the boiler (2), where it is burned, con-
verting its chemical energy into heat energy. Grinding
the coal into powder increases its surface area, which
helps it to burn faster and hotter, producing as much
heat and as little waste as possible.
As well as heat, burning coal produces ash and
exhaust gases. The ash falls to the bottom of the boiler
and is removed by the ash systems (3). It is usually then
sold to the building industry and used as an ingredient
in various building materials, like concrete.
The gases enter the exhaust stack (4), which con-
tains equipment that ﬁlters out any dust and ash, before
venting into the atmosphere. The exhaust stacks of coal
power stations are built tall so that the exhaust plume (5)
can disperse before it touches the ground. This ensures
that it does not affect the quality of the air around the
station.
Burning the coal heats water in pipes coiled around
the boiler, turning it into steam. The hot steam expands
in the pipes, so when it emerges it is under high pressure.
The pressure drives the steam over the blades of the
steam turbine (6), causing it to spin, converting the heat
energy released in the boiler into mechanical energy.
A shaft connects the steam turbine to the turbine
generator (7), so when the turbine spins, so does the
generator. The generator uses an electromagnetic ﬁeld
to convert this mechanical energy into electrical energy
(as described in Chapter 11).
After passing through the turbine, the steam comes
into contact with pipes full of cold water (8); in coastal
stations this water is pumped straight from the sea. The
cold pipes cool the steam so that it condenses back into
water. It is then piped back to the boiler, where it can
be heated up again, and turned into steam to keep the
turbine turning.
Finally, a transformer converts the electrical energy
from the generator to a high voltage. The national
grid uses high voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently
through the power lines (9) to the homes and businesses
that need it (10). Here, other transformers reduce the
voltage back down to a usable level.
Coal has been a reliable source of energy for many
decades;howevercoalisconsideredtoproducethehigh-
estamountofcarbonemissionsofanyformofelectricity
generation. A new technology called Carbon Capture
and Storage (CCS) is being developed to remove up
to 90% carbon dioxide from power station emissions
and store it underground. CCS will be an important
way to cut emissions and meet international low carbon
targets.

Advantages of coal
Coal is easily combustible, and burns at low temper-
atures, making coal-ﬁred boilers cheaper and simpler
than many others. It is widely and easily distributed all
over the world, is comparatively inexpensive to buy on
the open market due to large reserves and easy accessi-
bility, has good availability for much of the world (i.e.
coal is found in many more places than other fossil
fuels) and is mainly simple to mine, making it by far
the least expensive fossil fuel to actually obtain. It is
economically possible to build a wide variety of sizes
of generation plants, and a fossil-fuelled power station
can be built almost anywhere, so long as you can get
large quantities of fuel to it – most coal ﬁred power
stations have dedicated rail links to supply the coal.
Disadvantages of coal
Coal is non-renewableand fast depleting, has the lowest
energydensity of any fossil fuel, i.e. it producesthe least
energy per ton of fuel, and has the lowest energy den-
sity per unit volume, meaning that the amount of energy
generated per cubic metre is lower than any other fossil
fuel. Coal has high transportation costs due to the bulk
of coal, coal dust is an extreme explosion hazard, so
transportationand storage must take special precautions
to mitigate this danger. Storage costs are high, espe-
cially if required to have enough stock for a few years
to assure power production availability. Burning fossil
fuels releases carbon dioxide, a powerful greenhouse
gas, that had been stored in the earth for millions of
years – contributingto global warming – and coal leaves
behind harmful by-products upon combustion (both air-
borne and in solid-waste form), thereby causing a lot
of pollution (air pollution due to burning coal is much
worse than any other form of power generation, and
very expensive ‘scrubbers’ must be installed toremove a
signiﬁcant amount of it; even then, a non-trivial amount
escapes into the air). Mining of coal leads to irreversible
damage to the adjoining environment, coal will eventu-
ally run out, cannot be recycled, and prices for all fossil
fuels are rising, especially if the real cost of their carbon
is included.

21.3 Generating electrical power
using oil
An oil power station turns the chemical energy in oil
into electrical energy that can be used in homes and
businesses.
In Figure 21.2, the oil (1) is piped into the boiler (2),
where it is burned, converting its chemical energy into
heat energy. This heats water in pipes coiled around the
boiler, turning it into steam. The hot steam expands in
the narrow pipes, so when it emerges it is under high
pressure.
The pressure drives the steam over the blades of the
steam turbine (3), causing it to spin, converting the heat
energy released in the boiler into mechanical energy. A
shaft connects the steam turbine to the turbine generator
(4), so when the turbine spins, so does the generator. The
generator uses an electromagnetic ﬁeld to convert this
mechanical energy into electrical energy.
After passing through the turbine, the steam comes

pipes cool the steam so that it condenses back into water.
It is then piped back to the boiler, where it can be heated
up again, and turned into steam again to keep the turbine
turning.
Finally, a transformer converts the electrical energy
from the generator to a high voltage. The national
grid uses high voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently
through the power lines (6) to the homes and businesses
that need it (7). Here, other transformers reduce the
voltage back down to a usable level.
As well as heat, burning oil produces exhaust gases.
These are piped from the boiler to the exhaust stack (8),
which contains equipment that ﬁlters out any particles,
before venting into the atmosphere. The stackis built tall
so that the exhaust gas plume (9) can disperse before it
touches the ground. This ensures that it does not affect
the quality of the air around the station.
Advantages of oil
Oil has a high energy density (i.e. a small amount of
oil can produce a large amount of energy), has easy

availability and infrastructure for transport, is easy to
use, is crucial for a wide variety of industries, is rela-
tively easy to produce and reﬁne, is a constant power
source and is highly reliable.
Disadvantages of oil
Oil produces greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), can
cause pollution of water and earth, emits harmful sub-
stances like sulphur dioxide,carbon monoxide,and acid
rain, and can lead to production of very harmful and
toxic materials during reﬁning (plastic being one of the
most harmful of substances).

Figure 21.3
In Figure 21.3, natural gas (1) is pumped into the gas
turbine (2), where it is mixed with air (3) and burned,
convertingits chemical energy into heat energy.As well
as heat, burning natural gas produces a mixture of gases
called the combustion gas. The heat makes the combus-
tion gas expand. In the enclosed gas turbine, this causes
a build-up of pressure.
The pressure drives the combustion gas over the
blades of the gas turbine, causing it to spin, convert-
ing some of the heat energy into mechanical energy. A
shaft connects the gas turbine to the gas turbine genera-
tor (4), so when the turbine spins, the generator does too.
The generator uses an electromagnetic ﬁeld to convert
this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
After passing through the gas turbine, the still-hot
combustion gas is piped to the heat recovery steam gen-
erator (5). Here it is used to heat pipes full of water,
turning the water to steam, before escaping through the
exhaust stack (6). Natural gas burns very cleanly, but the
stack is still built tall so that the exhaust gas plume (7)

Part 3

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
can disperse before it touches the ground. This ensures
that it does not affect the quality of the air around the
station.
The hot steam expands in the pipes, so when it
emerges it is under high pressure. These high-pressure
steam jets spin the steam turbine (8), just like the com-
bustion gas spins the gas turbine. The steam turbine
is connected by a shaft to the steam turbine generator
(9), which converts the turbine’s mechanicalenergyinto
electrical energy.
After passing through the turbine, the steam comes
into contact with pipes full of cold water (10). In coastal
stations this water is pumped straight from the sea. The
cold pipes cool the steam so that it condenses back into
water. It is then piped back to the heat recovery steam
generator to be re-used.
Finally, a transformer converts the electrical energy
from the generator to a high voltage. The national grid
uses high voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently
through the power lines (11) to the homes and busi-
nesses that need it (12). Here, other transformers reduce
the voltage back down to a usable level.
Advantages of natural gas
Gas is used to produce electricity, is less harmful than
coal or oil, is easy to store and transport, has much
residential use, is used for vehicle fuel, burns cleaner
without leaving any smell, ash or smoke, is an instant
energy, ideal in kitchens, has much industrial use for
producing hydrogen, ammonia for fertilizers and some
paints and plastics, and is abundant and versatile.
Disadvantages of natural gas
Gas is toxic and ﬂammable, can damage the environ-
ment, is non-renewable, and is expensive to install.
21.5 Generating electrical power
using nuclear energy
A nuclear power station turns the nuclear energy in ura-
nium atoms into electrical energy that can be used in
homes and businesses.
In Figure 21.4, the reactor vessel (1) is a tough steel
capsule that houses the fuel rods –sealedmetalcylinders
containing pellets of uranium oxide. When a neutron –
a neutrally charged subatomic particle – hits a uranium
atom, the atom sometimes splits, releasing two or three
more neutrons.This process convertsthe nuclear energy
that binds the atom together into heat energy.
The fuel assemblies are arranged in such a way that
when atoms in the fuel split, the neutrons they release
are likely to hit other atoms and make them split as well.
This chain reaction produces large quantities of heat.
Water ﬂows through the reactor vessel, where the
chain reactionheats it to around300◦C. The water needs
to stay in liquid form for the power station to work,
so the pressuriser (2) subjects it to around 155 times
atmospheric pressure, which stops it boiling.
The reactor coolant pump (3) circulates the hot pres-
surised water from the reactor vessel to the steam
generator (4). Here, the water ﬂows through thousands
of looped pipes before circulating back to the reactor
vessel. A second stream of water ﬂows through the
steam generator, around the outside of the pipes. This
water is under much less pressure, so the heat from the
pipes boils it into steam.
The steam then passes through a series of turbines
(5), causing them to spin, converting the heat energy
produced in the reactor into mechanical energy. A shaft
connects the turbines to a generator, so when the tur-
bines spin, so does the generator. The generator uses an
electromagnetic ﬁeld to convert this mechanical energy
into electrical energy.
A transformer converts the electrical energy from the
generator to a high voltage. The national grid uses high
voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently through the
power lines (6) to the homes and businesses that need
it (7). Here, other transformers reduce the voltage back
down to a usable level.
After passing through the turbines, the steam comes
into contact with pipes full of cold water pumped in
from the sea (8). The cold pipes cool the steam so that
it condenses back into water. It is then piped back to the
steam generator, where it can be heated up again, and
turned into steam again to keep the turbines turning.
Advantages of nuclear energy
Nuclear energy is reliable, has low fuel costs, low elec-
tricity costs, no greenhouse gas emissions/air pollution,
has a high load factor and huge potential.
Disadvantages of nuclear energy
Disadvantages of nuclear energy includes the fear of
nuclear and radiation accidents, the problems of nuclear
waste disposal, the low level of radioactivity from nor-
mal operations, the fear of nuclear proliferation, high
capital investment, cost overruns and long gestation
time, the many regulations for nuclear energy power
plants, and fuel danger – uranium is limited to only a
few countries and suppliers.

21.6 Generating electrical power
using hydro power
A hydroelectric power station converts the kinetic – or
moving – energy in ﬂowing or falling water into elec-
trical energy that can be used in homes and businesses.
Hydroelectric power can be generated on a small scale
with a ‘run-of-river’ installation, which uses naturally
ﬂowing river water to turn one or more turbines, or on
a large scale with a hydroelectric dam.
A hydroelectric dam straddles a river, blocking
the water’s progress downstream. With reference to
Figure 21.5, water collects on the upstream side of the
dam, forming an artiﬁcial lake known as a reservoir (1).
Damming the river converts the water’s kinetic energy
intopotentialenergy:thereservoirbecomesasortofbat-
tery, storing energy that can be released a little at a time.
As well as being a source of energy, some reservoirs are
used as boating lakes or drinking water supplies.
Thereservoir’spotentialenergyisconvertedbackinto
kinetic energy by opening underwater gates, or intakes
(2), in the dam. When an intake opens, the immense
weight of the reservoir forces water through a channel
called the penstock (3) towards a turbine. The water
rushes past the turbine, hitting its blades and causing it
to spin, converting some of the water’s kinetic energy
into mechanical energy.The water then ﬁnally ﬂows out
of the dam and continues its journey downstream.
A shaft connects the turbine to a generator (4), so
when the turbine spins, so does the generator. The
generator uses an electromagnetic ﬁeld to convert this
mechanical energy into electrical energy.
As long as there is plenty of water in the reservoir,
a hydroelectric dam can respond quickly to changes in
demand for electricity. Opening and closing the intakes
directly controls the amount of water ﬂowing through
thepenstock,whichdeterminestheamountofelectricity
the dam is generating.
The turbine and generator are located in the dam’s
power house (5), which also houses a transformer. The
transformer converts the electrical energy from the gen-
erator to a high voltage. The national grid uses high
voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently through the
power lines (6) to the homes and businesses that need
it (7). Here, other transformers reduce the voltage back
down to a usable level.

Advantages of hydro power
With hydro power there are no fuel costs, low operating
costs and little maintenance, low electricity costs, no
greenhouse gas emissions/air pollution, energy storage
possibilities,smallsizehydroplantspossible,reliability,
a high load factor and long life.
Disadvantages of hydro power
Disadvantages of hydro power includes environmental,
dislocation and tribal rights difﬁculties, wildlife and ﬁsh
being affected, the possibility of earthquake vulnerabil-
ity, siltation, dam failure due to poor construction or
terrorism, the fact that plants cannot be built anywhere,
and long gestation times.
21.7 Generating electrical power
using pumped storage
Pumped storage reservoirs provide a place to store
energy until it’s needed. There are ﬂuctuations in
demand for electricity throughout the day. For example
when a popular TV programme ﬁnishes, many people
put the kettle on, causing a peak in demand for electrical
power.
When electricity is suddenly demanded, a way is
needed of producing power which can go from pro-
ducing no power to full power immediately, and keep
generatingpower forhalf an houror so until other power
stations can catch up with the demand for energy. This
is why pumped storage reservoirs are so useful.
A pumped storage plant has two separate reservoirs,
an upper and a lower one. When electricity is in low
demand, for example at night, water is pumped into the
upper reservoir.
When there is a sudden demand for power, giant taps
known as the head gates are opened. This allows water
from the upper reservoir toﬂowthroughpipes, powering
a turbine, into the lower reservoir.
The movement of the turbine turns a generator which
creates electricity. The electricity is created in the gen-
erator by using powerful magnets and coils of wire.
When the coils are spun quickly inside the magnets,
they produce electricity.
Water exiting from the pipe ﬂows into the lower
reservoir rather than re-entering a river and ﬂowing

Part 3
Ways of generating electricity – the present and the future
331
downstream. At night, the water in the lower reservoir
can be pumped back up into the upper reservoir to be
used again.
In terms of how pumped storage and dammed water
generate electricity, the methods are the same. The
difference is that in pumped storage, the water is contin-
ually reused, whereas in hydroelectric dams, the water
which generates electricity continues ﬂowing downriver
after use.
Pumped storage in the UK: Most pumped storage
plants are located in Scotland, except the largest of all,
Dinorwig, which is in North Wales. Dinorwig, built in
1984, produces 1728 MW – which is enough electricity
to power nearly 7 million desktop computers. Dinorwig
has the fastest ‘response time’ of any pumped storage
plant in the world – it can provide 1320 MW in 12
seconds.
Advantages of pumped storage
Pumped storage provides a way to generate electricity
instantly and quickly, no pollution or waste is created,
and there is little effect on the landscape, as typically
pumped storage plants are made from existing lakes in
mountains.
Disadvantages of pumped storage
Pumped storage facilities are expensive to build, and
once the pumped storage plant is used, it cannot be
used again until the water is pumped back to the upper
reservoir.
21.8 Generating electrical power
using wind
Wind turbines use the wind’s kinetic energy to generate
electrical energy that can be used in homes and busi-
nesses. Individualwind turbines can be used to generate
electricity on a small scale – to power a single home,
for example. A large number of wind turbines grouped
together, sometimes known as a wind farm or wind park,
can generate electricity on a much larger scale.
A wind turbine works like a high-tech version of an
old-fashioned windmill. The wind blows on the angled
blades of the rotor, causing it to spin, converting some
of the wind’s kinetic energy into mechanical energy.
Sensors in the turbine detect how strongly the wind is
blowing and from which direction. The rotor automat-
ically turns to face the wind, and automatically brakes
in dangerously high winds to protect the turbine from
damage.
With reference to Figure 21.6, a shaft and gearbox
connect the rotor to a generator (1), so when the rotor
spins, so does the generator. The generator uses an elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld to convert this mechanical energy into
electrical energy.
The electrical energy from the generator is transmit-
ted along cables to a substation (2). Here, the electrical
energy generated by all the turbines in the wind farm is
combined and converted to a high voltage. The national
grid uses high voltages to transmit electricity efﬁciently
through the power lines (3) to the homes and businesses
that need it (4). Here, other transformers reduce the
voltage back down to a usable level.
Advantages of wind energy
Wind energy has no pollution and global warming
effects, low costs, a large industrial base, no fuel costs,
and offshore advantages.
Disadvantages of wind energy
Wind energy has low persistent noise, can cause a loss
of scenery, requires land usage, and is intermittent in
nature.
21.9 Generating electrical power
using tidal power
The tide moves a huge amount of water twice each day,
and harnessing it could provide a great deal of energy –
for example, around 20% of Britain’s needs. Although
the energy supply is reliable and plentiful, converting it
into useful electrical power is not easy.
There are eight main sites around Britain where tidal
powerstationscouldusefullybebuilt,includingtheSev-
ern, Dee, Solway and Humberestuaries. Only around20
sites in the world have been identiﬁed as possible tidal
power stations.
Tidal energy is produced through the use of tidal
energy generators, as shown in Figure 21.7. These large
underwater turbines are placed in areas with high tidal
movements, and are designed to capture the kinetic
motion of the ebbing and surging of ocean tides in order
to produce electricity. Tidal power has great potential
for future power and electricity generation because of
the massive size of the oceans.

Advantages of tidal power
Tidalpowerisrenewable,non-pollutingandcarbonneg-

high energy density and high load factor.
Disadvantages of tidal power
Tidal power has high initial capital investment, limited
locations, detrimental effects on marine life, immature
technology, long gestation time, some difﬁculties in
transmission of tidal electricity, and weather effects that
can damage tidal power equipment.
21.10 Generating electrical power
using biomass
Biomass is fuel that is developed from organicmaterials,
a renewable and sustainable source of energy used to
create electricity or other forms of power, as stated in
para 6, page 85.
There are several methods to convert biomass into
electricity:
One way is to simply burn biomass directly, heat
water to steam, and sending it through a steam tur-
bine, which then generates electricity. The second way
requires gasiﬁcation of biomass. A biomass gasiﬁer
takes dry biomass, such as agriculture waste, and with
the absence of oxygen and high temperatures produces
synthesis gas (CO+H2), also known as pyrolysis of
biomass. The gasiﬁcation process turns wet biomass,
such as food waste and manure, into methane (CH4)
in a digestion tank. Both methane and synthesis gas
(syngas) can be used in a gas engine or a gas turbine
for electricity production. A third way to produce elec-
tricity from gasiﬁed biomass is by using fuel cells. If
biogas/bio-syngas is available with high enough purity
fuel cells can be used to produce bio-electricity. How-
ever, the fuel cells break down quickly if the gas in
any way contains impurities. This technology is not yet
commercial.
Biofuels, like ethanol, biodiesel and bio-oil can be also
be used for power production in most types of power
generators built for gasoline or diesel.
The generation of electricity from biomass results not
only in electricity, but also a lot of heat. A traditional gas
engine will have an efﬁciency of 30–35%. Gas turbines
and steam turbines will end up at around 50%.
It is common to also use the heat from these processes,
thus increasing the overall energy efﬁciency. There are
many plants that combine heat and power production
from biomass – the biogas plant cost increases, but
the long term savings that come with better energy
efﬁciency is in most cases worth it.
Advantages of biomass energy
Biomass energyis carbonneutral,uses waste efﬁciently,
is a continuous source of power, can use a large variety
of feedstock, has a low capital investment, can be built
in remote areas and on a small scale, reduces methane,
is easily available and is a low cost resource.
Disadvantages of biomass energy
With biomass energy, pollution can occur where poor
technology is used, continuous feedstock is needed
for efﬁciency, good management of biomass plants are
required, has limited potential compared to other forms
of energy like solar, hydro etc, and biomass plants are
unpopular if constructed near homes.
21.11 Generating electrical power
using solar energy
Solar panels turn energy from the sun’s rays directly into
useful energy that can be used in homes and businesses.
There are two main types: solar thermal and photo-
voltaic, or PV. Solar thermal panels use the sun’s energy
to heat water that can be used in washing and heating.
PV panels use the photovoltaic effect to turn the sun’s
energy directly into electricity, which can supplement
or replace a building’s usual supply.
A PV panel is made up of a semiconducting material,
usually silicon-based, sandwiched between two electri-
cal contacts. Referring to Figure 21.8, to generate as
much electricity as possible, PV panels need to spend
as much time as possible in direct sunlight (1a). A slop-
ing, south-facing roof is the ideal place to mount a solar
panel.
A sheet of glass (1b) protects the semiconductor sand-
wich from hail, grit blown by the wind, and wildlife.
The semiconductor is also coated in an antireﬂective
substance (1c), which makes sure that it absorbs the
sunlight it needs instead of scattering it uselessly away.
When sunlight strikes the panel and is absorbed, it
knocks loose electrons from some of the atoms that
make up the semiconductor (1d). The semiconductor is
positively charged on one side and negatively charged
on the other side, which encourages all these loose elec-
trons to travel in the same direction, creating an electric
current. The contacts (1e and 1f) capture this current
(1g) in an electrical circuit.

The electricity PV panels (2) generate direct current
(d.c.). Before it can be used in homes and businesses,
it has to be changed into alternating current (a.c.) elec-
tricity using an inverter (3). The inverted current then
travels from the inverter to the building’s fuse box (4)
and from there to the appliances that need it.
PV systems installed in homes and businesses can
include a dedicated metering box (5) that measures how
much electricity the panels are generating. As an incen-
tive to generate renewable energy, energy suppliers pay
the system’s owner a ﬁxed rate for every unit of elec-
tricity it generates – plus a bonus for units the owner
doesn’t use, because these can help supply the national
grid. Installing a PV system is not cheap, but this deal
can help the owner to earn back the cost more quickly –
and potentially even make a proﬁt one day.
Advantages of solar power
Solar power is environmentally friendly, has declining
costs, no fuel, low maintenance, no pollution, has almost
unlimited potential, has the advantage that installations
can be any size, and installation can be quick.
Disadvantages of solar power
Solar power has higher initial costs than fossil energy
forms, is intermittent in nature, and has high capital
investment.
21.12 Harnessing the power of wind,
tide and sun on an ‘energy
island’ – a future possibility?
Man-made ‘energy islands’ anchored, say, in the North
Sea and the English Channel could help the world meet
increasing power demands – and tackle the problem of
expanding population by providing homes for people.
The artiﬁcial structures – the brainchild of mechan-
ical engineer Professor Carl Ross, of the University

Part 3
Ways of generating electricity – the present and the future
335
of Portsmouth – would produce energy by harness-
ing the power of the wind, tide and sun, and could be
towed far out to sea to avoid complaints of noise and
unsightliness.
A particular problem, especially in smaller over-
crowded countries, such as those found in Europe and
Asia, is the NIMBY syndrome – that is, the ‘Not In My
Back Yard’ reaction of people. Complaints that using
these renewable methods of producing energy takes
up valuable land space, is unsightly, and causes noise
are common. Putting these three renewable energy-
producing forms on a ﬂoating island, all these negative
points can be avoided. Two-thirds of the Earth’s surface
is covered by water, so dry land is not being ‘lost’ –
in fact, the oceans are being colonised. Professor Ross
feels that once this technology is matured, humans can
even start living on the ﬂoating island to help counter
over-population.
In 2011 the United Nations announced that the global
population had reached seven billion, and the momen-
tum of a growing population does not show any signs
of slowing down.
The ﬂoating islands would be attached to the sea
bed by tubular pillars with vacuum chambers in their
bases,similartooffshoredrillingrigs.Theislandswould
support wind turbines and solar panels on their upper
surface, while underneath, tidal turbines would harness
the power of the oceans.
Professor Ross proposes that the ﬂoating energy
islands be deployed in locations including the deep sea
region of the North Sea, the west coast of Scotland and
the opening of the English Channel. Each one would
supply power for some 119,500 homes.
The islands comewith a heftyprice tag – an estimated
£1.7 billion – but Professor Ross believes the initial out-
lay would be recovered through household energy bills
after 11 years. However, this estimate is based mostly
on wind farms situated on land, and not at sea. For wind
farms at sea, the wind is about twice that on dry land.
Moreover the kinetic energy produced on the wind farm
is proportional to the mass of the wind, times its veloc-
ity squared; but the mass of the wind hitting the wind
turbine is proportional to its velocity; thus the kinetic
energy produced on the wind turbine at sea is propor-
tional to the velocity cubed of the wind hitting it, and
NOT on its velocity squared! This means that a wind tur-
bine at sea is likely to produce about 8 times the kinetic
energy than that produced on dry land, so that instead
of the wind farm paying for itself in about 11 years it
will pay for itself in less than 2 years! This revelation is
likely to favourably change the economic argument in
favour of wind turbines at sea!

ogy Vol 10, No 4, 2015, pages 45 to 52, ‘Floating

Chapter 22
Three-phase systems
Why it is important to understand: Three-phase systems
A three-phase circuit is an electrical distribution method that uses three alternating currents to supply
power. This type of power distribution is the most widely used in the world for transferring power from
generatingsystems to electrical supply grids. A three-phase circuit is also commonly used on large motors,
pumps and other pieces of mechanical equipment. Most households receive electricity in the form of
single-phase circuits, though some may have special three-phase circuit breakers installed for appliances
such as washing machines or stoves. A three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent
single-phase or two-phase system at the same voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit
electrical power. The three currents, together, deliver a balanced load, something not possible with single-
phase alternating current. With alternating current, the current direction alternates, ﬂowing back and
forth in the circuit; this means that the voltage alternates as well, constantly changing from maximum to
minimum. Three-phase power combines the three wires to offset the maximum and minimum oscillations,
so that a device receiving this type of power does not experience such a wide variation in voltage. This
makes three-phase power a very efﬁcient form of electrical power distribution. Consequently, a three-
phase electric motor uses less electricity and normally lasts longer than a single-phase motor of the same
voltage and rating. This chapter describes a three-phase system with star and delta connections and
explains how power is calculated.

22.1 Introduction
Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
via the National Grid system is accomplished by three-
phase alternating currents.
Figure 22.1
The voltage induced by a single coil when rotated in
a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Figure 22.1 and
is known as a single-phase voltage. Most consumers
are fed by means of a single-phase a.c. supply. Two
wires are used, one called the live conductor (usually
coloured red) and the other is called the neutral con-
ductor (usually coloured black). The neutral is usually
connected via protective gear to earth, the earth wire
being coloured green. The standard voltage for a single-
phase a.c. supply is 240V. The majority of single-phase
supplies are obtained by connection to a three-phase
supply (see Figure 22.5, page 338).
22.2 Three-phase supply
A three-phase supply is generated when three coils are
placed 120◦apart and the whole rotated in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld as shown in Figure 22.2(a). The result is
three independent supplies of equal voltages which are
each displaced by 120◦from each other, as shown in
Figure 22.2(b).
Figure 22.2
(i)
The convention adopted to identify each of the
phase voltages is: R – red, Y – yellow, and B –
blue, as shown in Figure 22.2.
(ii)
The phase-sequence is given by the sequence in
which the conductors pass the point initially taken
by the red conductor. The national standard phase
sequence is R,Y, B.
A three-phase a.c. supply is carried by three conduc-
tors, called ‘lines’ which are coloured red, yellow and
blue. The currents in these conductors are known as
line currents (IL) and the p.d.s between them are known
as line voltages (VL). A fourth conductor, called the
neutral (coloured black, and connected through pro-
tective devices to earth) is often used with a three-phase
supply.
If the three-phase windings shown in Figure 22.2 are
kept independent then six wires are needed to connect a
supply source (such as a generator) to a load (such as a
motor). To reduce the numberof wires it is usual to inter-
connect the three phases. There are two ways in which
this can be done, these being: (a) a star connection,
and (b) a delta, or mesh, connection. Sources of three-
phase supplies, i.e. alternators, are usually connected in
star, whereas three-phase transformer windings, motors
and other loads may be connected either in star or delta.
22.3 Star connection
(i)
A star-connected load is shown in Figure 22.3,
where the three line conductors are each con-
nected to a load and the outlets from the loads
are joined together at N to form what is termed
the neutral point or the star point.
Figure 22.3
(ii)
The voltages, VR, VY and VB are called phase
voltages or line to neutral voltages. Phase volt-
ages are generally denoted by Vp
(iii)
The voltages, VRY, VYB and VBR are called line
voltages.
(iv)
From Figure 22.3 it can be seen that the phase
currents (generally denoted by Ip) are equal to
their respective line currents IR, IY and IB, i.e.
for a star connection:

IL = Ip
(v)
For a balanced system:
IR =IY =IB,
VR =VY =VB
VRY =VYB =VBR, ZR =ZY =ZB
and the current in the neutral conductor, IN =0.
When a star-connected system is balanced, then
the neutral conductor is unnecessaryand is often
omitted.
(vi)
The line voltage, VRY, shown in Figure 22.4(a) is
given by VRY =VR −VY (VY is negative since it
is in the oppositedirection to VRY). In the phasor
diagramofFigure22.4(b),phasorVY isreversed
(shown by the broken line) and then added
phasorially to VR (i.e. VRY =VR +(−VY)). By
trigonometry, or by measurement, VRY=√3VR,
i.e. for a balanced star connection:
VL = √3 Vp
Figure 22.4
(SeeworkedProblem3followingforacomplete
phasor diagram of a star-connected system.)
(vii)
The star connection of the three phases of
a supply, together with a neutral conductor,
allows the use of two voltages – the phase volt-
age and the line voltage. A four-wire system
is also used when the load is not balanced.
The standard electricity supply to consumers
in Great Britain is 415/240V, 50Hz, three-
phase, four-wire alternating current A diagram
of connections is shown in Figure 22.5.
For most of the twentieth century, the sup-
ply voltage in the UK in domestic premises
has been 240V a.c. (r.m.s.) at 50Hz. In 1988,
a European-wide agreement was reached to
change the various national voltages, which
ranged at the time from 220V to 240V, to a
common European standard of 230V.

the UK has been 230V since 1995. However,
as an interim measure, electricity suppliers can
work with an asymmetric voltage tolerance of
230V +10%/−6% (i.e. 216.2V to 253V). The
old standard was 240V±6% (i.e. 225.6V to
254.4V), which is mostly contained within the
new range, and so in practice suppliers have had
no reason to actually change voltages.
Similarly, the three-phase voltage in the UK
had been for many years 415V±6% (i.e. 390V
to 440V). European harmonization required
this to be changed to 400V +10%/−6% (i.e.
376V to 440V).Again,since the present supply
voltage of 415V lies within this range, supply
companies are unlikely to reduce their voltages
in the near future.
Many of the calculations following are based
on the 240V/415V supply voltages which have
applied for many years andare likelyto continue
to do so.
Problem 1.
Three loads, each of resistance 30,
are connected in star to a 415V, three-phase supply.
Determine (a) the system phase voltage, (b) the
phase current and (c) the line current.
A ‘415V, three-phase supply’ means that 415V is the
line voltage, VL
(a)
For a star connection, VL =√3Vp
Hence phase voltage, Vp = VL
√3 = 415

(c)

Hence the line current, IL =8A
Problem 2.
A star-connected load consists of
three identical coils each of resistance 30 and
inductance 127.3mH. If the line current is 5.08 A,
calculate the line voltage if the supply frequency is
50Hz.
Inductive reactance

Impedance of each phase Zp = √(R2 + X2

For a star connection
IL = Ip = Vp
Zp
Hence phase voltage
Vp = IpZp =(5.08)(50)
= 254V
Line voltage
VL = √3Vp = √3(254)

Problem 3.
A balanced, three-wire,
star-connected, three-phase load has a phase voltage
of 240V, a line current of 5 A and a lagging power
factor of 0.966. Draw the complete phasor diagram.
The phasor diagram is shown in Figure 22.6.
Figure 22.6
Procedure to construct the phasor diagram:
(i)
Draw VR =VY =VB =240V and spaced 120◦
apart. (Note that VR is shown vertically upwards –
this, however, is immaterial for it may be drawn
in any direction.)
(ii)
Power factor=cosφ =0.966 lagging. Hence the
load phase angle is given by cos−1 0.966, i.e. 15◦
lagging. Hence IR =IY =IB =5A, lagging VR,
VY and VB, respectively, by 15◦
(iii)
VRY=VR −VY
(phasorially).
Hence
VY
is
reversed and added phasorially to VR. By
measurement, VRY =415V (i.e. √3(240)) and
leads VR by 30◦. Similarly, VYB=VY −VB and
VBR =VB −VR
Problem 4.
A 415V, three-phase, four wire,

120◦. The current in the neutral conductor is
given by:
IN = IR + IY + IB phasorially.

Figure 22.9 shows the three line currents added pha-
sorially. Oa represents IR in magnitude and direction.
From the nose of Oa, ab is drawn representing IY in
magnitude and direction. From the nose of ab, bc is
drawn representing IB in magnitude and direction. Oc
represents the resultant, IN
By measurement, IN =43A
Alternatively, by calculation, considering IR at 90◦, IB
at 210◦and IY at 330◦:
Total horizontal component = 100cos90◦+ 75cos330◦
+ 50cos210◦= 21.65
Total vertical component = 100sin90◦+ 75sin330◦
+ 50sin210◦= 37.50
Hence magnitude ofIN = √(21.652 + 37.502)
= 43.3A

Three identical capacitors are
connected in delta to a 415V, 50Hz, three-phase

22.6 Measurement of power
in three-phase systems
Power in three-phase loads may be measured by the
following methods:
(i)
One-wattmeter method for a balanced load
Wattmeter connections for both star and delta are
shown in Figure 22.12.
Total power = 3 × wattmeter reading
Figure 22.12
(ii)
Two-wattmeter method for balanced or unbal-
anced loads
A connection diagram for this method is shown
in Figure 22.13 for a star-connected load. Similar
connections are made for a delta-connected load.
Total power=sum of wattmeter readings
=P1+P2
Figure 22.13
The power factor may be determined from:
tan φ = √3
P1 −P2
P1 + P2

(see Problems
12 and 15 to 18)
It is possible, depending on the load power factor,
foronewattmetertohavetobe‘reversed’toobtaina
reading. In this case it is taken as a negative reading
(see worked Problem 17).
(iii)
Three-wattmeter method for a three-phase,
four-wire system for balanced and unbalanced
loads (see Figure 22.14).

Part 3

Total power = P1 + P2 + P3

Problem 12.
(a) Show that the total power in a
three-phase, three-wire system using the
two-wattmeter method of measurement is given by
the sum of the wattmeter readings. Draw a
connection diagram. (b) Draw a phasor diagram for
the two-wattmeter method for a balanced load.
(c) Use the phasor diagram of part (b) to derive a
formula from which the power factor of a
three-phase system may be determined using only
the wattmeter readings.
(a)
A connection diagram for the two-wattmeter
method of a power measurement is shown in
Figure 22.15 for a star-connected load.
Figure 22.15
Total instantaneous power, p=eRiR +eY iY +
eBiB and in any three-phase system iR +iY +
iB =0. Hence iB =−iR −iY
Thus, p=eRiR +eY iY +eB(−iR −iY )
= (eR −eB)iR +(eY −eB)iY
However, (eR −eB) is the p.d. across wattmeter 1
in Figure 22.15 and (eY −eB) is the p.d. across
wattmeter 2.
Hence total instantaneous power,
p=(wattmeter 1 reading)+(wattmeter 2 reading)
= p1 +p2
The moving systems of the wattmeters are unable
to follow the variations which take place at
normal frequencies and they indicate the mean
power taken over a cycle. Hence the total power,
P =P 1 +P 2 for balanced or unbalanced loads.
(b)
The phasor diagram for the two-wattmeter method
for a balanced load having a lagging current is
shown in Figure 22.16, where VRB =VR −VB and
VYB =VY −VB (phasorially).

Wattmeter 1 reads VRBIR cos(30◦−φ)=P1
Wattmeter 2 reads VYBIY cos(30◦+φ)=P2
P1
P2
= VRBIR cos(30◦−φ)
VYBIY cos(30◦+ φ) = cos(30◦−φ)

since IR =IY and VRB =VYB for a balanced load.
Hence P1
P2
= cos30◦cosφ + sin30◦sinφ
cos30◦cosφ −sin30◦sinφ
(from compoundangle formulae,see Higher Engi-
neering Mathematics, J.O. Bird, 2017, 8th edition,

Dividing throughout by cos 30◦cos φ gives:

Problem 13.
A 400V, three-phase star-connected
alternator supplies a delta-connected load, each
phase of which has a resistance of 30 and
inductive reactance 40. Calculate (a) the current
supplied by the alternator and (b) the output power
and the kVA of the alternator, neglecting losses in
the line between the alternator and load.
A circuit diagram of the alternator and load is shown in
Figure 22.17.
Figure 22.17

Considering the load: phase current, Ip = Vp
Zp
Vp =VL for a delta connection. Hence Vp =400V
Phase impedance, Zp =√(R2

Hence Ip = Vp
Zp

For a delta connection, line current,
IL =√3Ip = √3(8)=13.86A
Hence 13.86A is the current supplied by the
alternator.
(b)
Alternator output power is equal to the power
dissipated by the load.
i.e. P =√3VLIL cos φ, where cos φ = Rp
Zp

50 =0.6
Hence P =√3(400)(13.86)(0.6)=5.76kW
Alternator output kVA, S = √3VLIL

Hence φ =cos−1 0.602=52.99◦leading.
Phase current, Ip = Vp

Hence
Ip = 400

delta-connected system is greater than the line
current
in
the
corresponding star-connected

star-connected system as in a delta-connected sys-
tem, the line voltage in the star system is √3 times

(i)
For a given amount of power transmitted through

means a saving of copper(or aluminium)and thus
the original installation costs are less.

Chapter 23
Transformers
Why it is important to understand: Transformers
The transformer is one of the simplest of electrical devices. Its basic design, materials, and principles have
changed little over the last 100 years, yet transformer designs and materials continue to be improved.
Transformers are essential in high-voltage power transmission, providing an economical means of trans-
mitting power over large distances. A major application of transformers is to increase voltage before
transmitting electrical energy over long distances through cables. Cables have resistance and so dissipate
electrical energy. By transforming electrical power to a high-voltage, and therefore low-current form, for
transmission and back again afterwards, transformers enable economical transmission of power over
long distances. Consequently, transformers have shaped the electricity supply industry, permitting gen-
eration to be located remotely from points of demand. All but a tiny fraction of the world’s electrical
power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer. Transformers
are also used extensively in electronic products to step down the supply voltage to a level suitable for the
low-voltage circuits they contain. The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with
the supply voltage. Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of ampliﬁers and to match
devices such as microphones and record players to the input of ampliﬁers. Audio transformers allowed
telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. This chapter explains
the principle of operation of a transformer, its construction and associated calculations, including losses
and efﬁciency. Resistance matching, the auto transformer, the three-phase transformer and current and
voltage transformers are also discussed.

23.1 Introduction
A transformer is a device which uses the phenomenon of
mutual induction (see Chapter 11) to change the values
of alternating voltages and currents. In fact, one of the
main advantages of a.c. transmission and distribution
is the ease with which an alternating voltage can be
increased or decreased by transformers.
Losses in transformers are generally low and thus
efﬁciency is high. Being static, they have a long life and
are very stable.
Transformers range in size from the miniature units
used in electronic applications to the large power
transformers used in power stations. The principle of
operation is the same for each.
A transformer is represented in Figure 23.1(a)
as consisting of two electrical circuits linked by a
common ferromagnetic core. One coil is termed the
primary winding, which is connected to the supply
Figure 23.1
of electricity, and the other the secondary wind-
ing, which may be connected to a load. A cir-
cuit diagram symbol for a transformer is shown in
Figure 23.1(b).
Some typical practical transformers are shown in
Figure 23.2.
Figure 23.2
23.2 Transformer principle
of operation
Whenthesecondaryisanopen-circuitandanalternating
voltage V1 is applied to the primary winding, a small
current – called the no-load current I0 – ﬂows, which
sets up a magnetic ﬂux in the core. This alternating ﬂux
links with both primaryand secondarycoils and induces
in them e.m.f.s of E1 and E2, respectively, by mutual
induction.
The induced e.m.f. E in a coil of N turns is given by
E = −N d
dt volts,
where d/dt is the rate of change of ﬂux. In an ideal
transformer, the rate of change of ﬂux is the same for

Part 3
Transformers

both primary and secondary and thus E1/N1 =E2/N2,
i.e. the induced e.m.f. per turn is constant.
Assuming no losses, E1 =V1 and E2 =V2. Hence
V1
N1
= V2
N2
or
V1
V2
= N1
N2
(1)
V1/V2 is called the voltage ratio and N1/N2 the turns
ratio, or the ‘transformation ratio’ of the transformer.
If N2 is less than N1 then V2 is less than V1 and the
device is termed a step-down transformer. If N2 is
greater then N1 then V2 is greater than V1 and the device
is termed a step-up transformer.
When a load is connected across the secondary wind-
ing, a current I2 ﬂows. In an ideal transformer losses are
neglected and a transformer is considered to be 100%
efﬁcient.
Hence input power = output power, or V1I1 = V2I2,
i.e. in an ideal transformer,the primary and secondary
volt-amperes are equal.
Thus
V1
V2
= I2
I1
(2)
Combining equations (1) and (2) gives:
V1
V 2
= N1
N2
= I2
I1
(3)
The rating of a transformer is stated in terms of the
volt-amperes that it can transform without overheating.
With reference to Figure 23.1(a), the transformer rating
is either V1I1 or V2I2, where I2 is the full load secondary
current.
Problem 1.
A transformer has 500 primary turns
and 3000 secondary turns. If the primary voltage is
240V, determine the secondary voltage, assuming
an ideal transformer.
For an ideal transformer, voltage ratio = turns ratio, i.e.
V1
V2
= N1
N2
, hence 240
V2
= 500
3000
Thus secondary voltage V2 = (3000)(240)
(500)
=1440 V or 1.44 kV
Problem 2.
An ideal transformer with a turns
ratio of 2:7 is fed from a 240V supply. Determine
its output voltage.
A turns ratio of 2:7 means that the transformer has 2
turns on the primary for every 7 turns on the secondary
(i.e. a step-up transformer). Thus,
N1
N2
= 2
7
For an ideal transformer, N1
N2
= V1
V2
; hence 2
7 = 240
V2
Thus the secondary voltage V2 = (240)(7)
(2)
=840V
Problem 3.
An ideal transformer has a turns ratio
of 8:1 and the primary current is 3 A when it is
supplied at 240 V. Calculate the secondary voltage
and current.
A turns ratio of 8:1 means N1

The core ﬂux is common to both primary and sec-
ondarywindings in a transformer and is thus taken
as the reference phasor in a phasor diagram. On
no-load the primary winding takes a small no-
load current I0 and since, with losses neglected,
the primary winding is a pure inductor, this cur-
rent lags the applied voltage V1 by 90◦. In the
phasor diagram, assuming no losses, shown in
Figure 23.3(a), current I0 produces the ﬂux and is
drawn in phase with the ﬂux. The primary induced
e.m.f. E1 is in phase opposition to V1 (by Lenz’s
law) and is shown 180◦out of phase with V1 and
equal in magnitude. The secondary induced e.m.f.

23.4 E.m.f. equation of a transformer
The magnetic ﬂux  set up in the core of a transformer
when an alternating voltage is applied to its primary
winding is also alternating and is sinusoidal.
Let m be the maximum value of the ﬂux and f be
the frequency of the supply. The time for 1 cycle of the
alternating ﬂux is the periodic time T , where T =1/f
seconds.
The ﬂux rises sinusoidally from zero to its maximum
value in 1
4 cycle, and the time for 1
4 cycle is 1/4f
seconds.
Hence the average rate of change of ﬂux
=
m
(1/4f ) =4f m Wb/s,andsince1Wb/s=1volt,the
average e.m.f. induced in each turn=4f m volts.
As the ﬂux  varies sinusoidally, then a sinusoidal
e.m.f. will be induced in each turn of both primary and
secondary windings.

23.5 Transformer on-load phasor
diagram
If the voltage drop in the windings of a transformer are
assumed negligible, then the terminal voltage V2 is the
same as the induced e.m.f. E2 in the secondary. Simi-
larly, V1=E1. Assuming an equal number of turns on
primary and secondary windings, then E1 =E2, and let
the load have a lagging phase angle φ2
In the phasor diagram of Figure 23.5, current I 2 lags
V2 by angle φ2. When a load is connected across the
secondary winding a current I2 ﬂows in the secondary
winding. The resulting secondary e.m.f. acts so as to
tend to reduce the core ﬂux. However this does not hap-
pen since reduction of the core ﬂux reduces E1, hence
a reﬂected increase in primary current I ′
1 occurs which
provides a restoring mmf. Hence at all loads, primary
and secondary mmfs are equal, but in opposition, and
the core ﬂux remains constant. I ′
1 is sometimes called
the ‘balancing’ current and is equal, but in the opposite
direction, to current I2, as shown in Figure 23.5. I0,
shown at a phase angle φ0 to V1, is the no-load current
of the transformer (see Section 23.3).
The phasor sum of I ′
1 and I0 gives the supply current
I1, and the phase angle between V1, and I1 is shown
as φ1

23.6 Transformer construction
(i)
There are broadly two types of single-phase
double-wound transformer constructions – the
core type and the shell type, as shown in
Figure 23.7. The low- and high-voltage windings
are wound as shown to reduce leakage ﬂux.
Figure 23.7
(ii)
For power transformers, rated possibly at sev-
eral MVA and operating at a frequency of 50Hz
in Great Britain, the core material used is usually
laminated silicon steel or stalloy, the lamina-
tions reducing eddy currents and the silicon steel
keeping hysteresis loss to a minimum.
Large power transformers are used in the
main distribution system and in industrial sup-
ply circuits. Small power transformershave many
applications, examples including welding and
rectiﬁer supplies, domestic bell circuits, imported
washing machines, and so on.

For audio frequency (a.f.) transformers, rated
froma few mVA to no more than 20VA, and oper-
ating at frequencies up to about 15kHz, the small

core is also made of laminated silicon steel. A typ-
ical application of a.f. transformers is in an audio
ampliﬁer system.
(iv)
Radio frequency (r.f.) transformers, operating
in the MHz frequency region, have either an air
core, a ferrite core or a dust core. Ferrite is a
ceramic material havingmagnetic propertiessim-
ilar to silicon steel, but having a high resistivity.
Dust cores consist of ﬁne particles of carbonyl
iron or permalloy (i.e. nickel and iron), each par-
ticle of which is insulated from its neighbour.
Applications of r.f. transformers are found in
radio and television receivers.
(v)
Transformer windings are usually of enamel-
insulated copper or aluminium.
(vi)
Cooling is achieved by air in small transformers
and oil in large transformers.
23.7 Equivalent circuit of
a transformer
Figure 23.8shows an equivalentcircuit of a transformer.
R1 and R2 represent the resistances of the primary
and secondary windings and X1 and X2 represent the
reactances of the primary and secondary windings, due
to leakage ﬂux.
The core losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents are
allowed for by resistance R which takes a currentIC, the
core loss component of the primary current. Reactance
X takes the magnetizing component IM.
In a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit shown in Figure 23.9,
R and X are omitted since the no-load current I0 is
normally only about 3–5% of the full load primary
current.
Figure 23.9
It is often convenient to assume that all of the resistance
and reactance is on one side of the transformer.
Resistance R2 in Figure 23.9 can be replaced by
inserting an additional resistance R′
2 in the primary
circuit such that the power absorbed in R ′
2 when
carrying the primary current is equal to that in R2 due

23.8 Regulation of a transformer
When the secondary of a transformer is loaded, the sec-
ondary terminal voltage, V2, falls. As the power factor
decreases, this voltage drop increases. This is called
the regulation of the transformer and it is usually
expressed as a percentage of the secondary no-load
voltage, E2. For full-load conditions:
Regulation=
E2 −V2
E2

×100%
(10)
The fall in voltage, (E2−V2), is caused by the resistance
and reactance of the windings.
Typical values of voltage regulation are about 3% in
small transformers and about 1% in large transformers.

23.9 Transformer losses
and efﬁciency
Therearebroadlytwosourcesoflossesintransformers
on load, these being copper losses and iron losses.
(a)
Copper losses are variable and result in a heating
of the conductors, due to the fact that they possess
resistance. If R1 and R2 are the primary and sec-
ondary winding resistances then the total copper
loss is I2
1 R1 +I 2
2 R2
(b)
Iron losses are constant for a given value of fre-
quency and ﬂux density and are of two types –
hysteresis loss and eddy current loss.
(i) Hysteresis loss is the heating of the core
as a result of the internal molecular struc-
ture reversals which occur as the magnetic
ﬂux alternates. The loss is proportional to the
area of the hysteresis loop and thus low loss
nickel iron alloys are used for the core since
their hysteresis loops have small areas. (See
Chapters 9 and 41)
(ii) Eddy current loss is the heating of the
core due to e.m.f.s being induced not only
in the transformer windings but also in the
core. These induced e.m.f.s set up circulat-
ing currents, called eddy currents. Owing to
the low resistance of the core, eddy currents
can be quite considerable and can cause a
large power loss and excessive heating of the
core. Eddy current losses can be reduced by
increasing the resistivity of the core material
or, more usually, by laminating the core
(i.e. splitting it into layers or leaves) when
very thin layers of insulating material can
be inserted between each pair of laminations.
This increases the resistance of the eddy cur-
rent path, and reduces the value of the eddy
current.

23.10 Resistance matching
Varying a load resistance to be equal, or almost equal,
to the source internal resistance is called match-
ing. Examples where resistance matching is important
include coupling an aerial to a transmitter or receiver,
or in coupling a loudspeaker to an ampliﬁer, where cou-
pling transformersmay be used to givemaximumpower
transfer.
With d.c. generators or secondary cells, the internal
resistance is usually very small. In such cases, if an
attempt is made to make the load resistance as small as
the source internal resistance, overloading of the source
results.
A method of achieving maximum power trans-
fer between a source and a load (see Section 15.9,
page 239), is to adjust the value of the load resis-
tance to ‘match’ the source internal resistance. A
transformer may be used as a resistance matching
device by connecting it between the load and the
source.
The reason why a transformer can be used for this is
shown below. With reference to Figure 23.11:

23.11 Auto transformers
An auto transformer is a transformer which has part
of its winding common to the primary and secondary
circuits. Figure 23.15(a) shows the circuit for a double-
wound transformer and Figure 23.15(b) that for an auto
transformer. The latter shows that the secondary is actu-
ally part of the primary, the current in the secondary
being (I2 −I1). Since the current is less in this section,
the cross-sectional area of the winding can be reduced,
which reduces the amount of material necessary.
Figure 23.15
Figure 23.16 shows the circuit diagram symbol for an
auto transformer.

Problem 25.
A single-phase auto transformer has
a voltage ratio 320 V:250 V and supplies a load of
20kVA at 250V. Assuming an ideal transformer,
determine the current in each section of the
winding.

Hence primary current, I1 = 20 × 103

and secondary current, I2 = 20 × 103
V2

Hence current in common part of the winding
=80−62.5=17.5A

Saving of copper in an auto transformer
For the same output and voltage ratio, the auto trans-
former requires less copper than an ordinary double-
wound transformer. This is explained below.
The volume, and hence weight, of copper required
in a winding is proportional to the number of turns and
to the cross-sectional area of the wire. In turn, this is
proportional to the current to be carried, i.e. volume of
copper is proportional to NI
Volume of copper in an auto transformer
∝(N1 −N2)I1 + N2(I2 −I1)
see Figure 23.15(b)
∝N1I1 −N2I1 + N2I2 −N2I1
∝N1I1 + N2I2 −2N2I1
∝2N1I1 −2N2I1
(since N2I2 = N1I1)
Volume of copper in a double-wound
transformer ∝N1I1 +N2I2
∝2N1I1
(again, since N2I2 =N1I1)
Hence

The closer N2 is to N1, the greater the saving in copper.
Problem 26.
Determine the saving in the volume
of copper used in an auto transformer compared
with a double-wound transformer for (a) a
200 V:150 V transformer, and (b) a 500 V:100 V
transformer.
(a)
For a 200V:150V transformer, x = V2
V1

Hence from equation (12), (volume of copper in

=25% of copper in a double-wound

Hence the saving is 75%
(b)

Hence the saving is 20%

Advantages of auto transformers
Theadvantagesofautotransformersoverdouble-wound
transformers include:
1.
a saving in cost since less copper is needed (see
above)
2.
less volume, hence less weight
3.
a higher efﬁciency,resulting from lower I 2R losses
4.
a continuouslyvariableoutput voltageis achievable
if a sliding contact is used
5.
a smaller percentage voltage regulation.
Disadvantages of auto transformers
The primary and secondary windings are not electrically
separate, hence if an open-circuit occurs in the sec-
ondary winding the full primary voltage appears across
the secondary.
Uses of auto transformers
Auto transformers are used for reducing the volt-
age when starting induction motors (see Chapter 25)
and for interconnecting systems that are operating at
approximately the same voltage.
23.12 Isolating transformers
Transformers not only enable current or voltage to be
transformed to some different magnitude, but provide a
means of isolating electrically one part of a circuit from
another when there is no electrical connection between
primary and secondary windings. An isolating trans-
former is a 1:1 ratio transformer with several impor-
tant applications, including bathroom shaver-sockets,
portable electric tools, model railways and so on.
23.13 Three-phase transformers
Three-phase, double-wound transformers are mainly
used in power transmission and are usually of the core
type. They basically consist of three pairs of single-
phase windings mounted on one core, as shown in
Figure 23.18, which gives a considerable saving in the
amount of iron used. The primary and secondary wind-
ings in Figure 23.18 are wound on top of each other in
the form of concentric cylinders, similar to that shown in
Figure 23.7(a). The windings may be with the primary
delta-connected and the secondary star-connected, or
star–delta, star–star or delta–delta, depending on its use.

23.14 Current transformers
For measuring currents in excess of about 100A, a cur-
rent transformer is normally used. With a d.c. moving-
coil ammeter the current required to give full-scale
deﬂection is very small – typically a few milliamperes.
When larger currents are to be measured a shunt resistor
is added to the circuit (see Chapter 12). However, even
with shunt resistors added it is not possible to measure
very large currents. When a.c. is being measured a shunt
cannot be used since the proportionof the current which
ﬂows in the meter will depend on its impedance, which
varies with frequency.

In current transformers the primary usually consists of

Current transformers isolate the ammeter from the main
circuit and allow the use of a standard range ofammeters
giving full-scale deﬂections of 1A, 2A or 5A.
For very large currents the transformer core can be
mounted around the conductor or bus-bar. Thus the pri-
mary then has just one turn. It is very important to
short-circuit the secondary windingbeforeremovingthe
ammeter. This is because if current is ﬂowing in the pri-
mary,dangerouslyhigh voltages could be induced in the
secondary should it be open-circuited.

For measuring voltages in excess of about 500V it
is often safer to use a voltage transformer. These
are normal double-wound transformers with a large
number of turns on the primary, which is connected
to a high voltage supply, and a small number of turns
on the secondary. A typical arrangement is shown in

Chapter 24
D.c. machines
Why it is important to understand: D.c. machines
A machine which converts d.c. electrical power into mechanical power is known as a d.c. motor. A machine
which converts mechanical power into electrical power is called a d.c. generator. From a construction
point of view there is no difference between a d.c. motor and generator. D.c. motors have been available
for nearly 100 years; in fact the ﬁrst electric motors were designed and built for operation from direct
current power. D.c. motors have a wide speed range, good speed regulation, compact size and light weight
(relative to mechanical variable speed), ease of control, low maintenance and low cost. The armature
and ﬁeld in a d.c. motor can be connected three different ways to provide varying amounts of torque
or different types of speed control. The armature and ﬁeld windings are designed slightly differently for
different types of d.c. motors. The three basic types of d.c. motors are the series motor, the shunt motor
and the compound motor. The series motor is designed to move large loads with high starting torque in
applications such as a crane motor or lift hoist. The shunt motor is designed slightly differently, since it is
made for applications such as pumping ﬂuids, where constant-speed characteristics are important. The
compound motor is designed with some of the series motor’s characteristicsand some of the shunt motor’s
characteristics. This allows the compound motor to be used in applications where high starting torque
and controlled operating speed are both required. In this chapter, types of d.c. motor and generator are
described, together with associated calculations. The motor starter and methods of speed control are also
considered.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•

24.1 Introduction
When the input to an electrical machine is electrical
energy (seen as applying a voltage to the electrical
terminals of the machine), and the output is mechan-
ical energy (seen as a rotating shaft), the machine is
called an electric motor. Thus anelectric motor converts
electrical energy into mechanical energy.
The principle of operation of a motor is explained in
Section 10.4, page 142.
When the input to an electrical machine is mechan-
ical energy (seen as, say, a diesel motor, coupled to
the machine by a shaft), and the output is electrical
energy (seen as a voltage appearing at the electrical
terminals of the machine), the machine is called a gen-
erator. Thus, a generator converts mechanical energy
to electrical energy.
The principle of operation of a generator is explained in
Section 11.2, page 147.
24.2 The action of a commutator
In an electric motor, conductors rotate in a uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld. A single-loop conductor mounted between
permanent magnets is shown in Figure 24.1. A voltage
is applied at points A and B in Figure 24.1(a).
A force, F, acts on the loop due to the interaction
of the magnetic ﬁeld of the permanent magnets and the
magneticﬁeld createdby the currentﬂowingin the loop.
This force is proportional to the ﬂux density, B, the cur-
rent ﬂowing, I, and the effective length of the conductor,
l, i.e. F =BIl. The force is made up of two parts, one
acting vertically downwards due to the current ﬂowing
from C to D and the other acting vertically upwards
due to the current ﬂowing from E to F (from Fleming’s
left-hand rule). If the loop is free to rotate, then when it
has rotated through 180◦, the conductors are as shown
in Figure 24.1(b). For rotation to continue in the same
Figure 24.1
direction, it is necessary for the current ﬂow to be as
shown in Figure 24.1(b), i.e. from D to C and from
F to E. This apparent reversal in the direction of cur-
rent ﬂow is achieved by a process called commutation.
With reference to Figure 24.2(a), when a direct voltage
is applied at A and B, then as the single-loop conduc-
tor rotates, current ﬂow will always be away from the
commutator for the part of the conductor adjacent to the
N-pole and towards the commutator for the part of the
conductor adjacent to the S-pole. Thus the forces act to
give continuous rotation in an anticlockwise direction.
The arrangement shown in Figure 24.2(a) is called a
‘two-segment’ commutator and the voltage is applied
to the rotating segments by stationary brushes (usually
carbon blocks), which slide on the commutator material
(usually copper), when rotation takes place.
In practice, there are many conductors on the rotating
part of a d.c. machine and these are attached to many

commutator segments. A schematic diagram of a multi-
segment commutator is shown in Figure 24.2(b).
Poor commutation results in sparking at the trailing
edge of the brushes. This can be improved by using
interpoles (situated between each pair of main poles),
high resistance brushes, or using brushes spanning
several commutator segments.
24.3 D.c. machine construction
The basic parts of any d.c. machine are shown in
Figure 24.3, and comprise:
Figure 24.3
(a)
A stationary part called the stator having,
(i)
a steel ring called the yoke, to which are
attached
(ii)
the magnetic poles, around which are the
(iii)
ﬁeld windings, i.e. many turns of a con-
ductor wound round the pole core; current
passing through this conductor creates an
electromagnet (rather than the permanent
magnets shown in Figures 24.1 and 24.2).
(b)
A rotating part called the armature mounted in
bearings housed in the stator and having,
(iv)
a laminated cylinder of iron or steel called
the core, on which teeth are cut to house
the
(v)
armature winding, i.e. a single or multi-
loop conductor system and
(vi)
the commutator (see Section 24.2).
Armature windings can be divided into two groups,
depending on how the wires are joined to the com-
mutator. These are called wave windings and lap
windings.
(a)
In wave windings there are two paths in par-
allel, irrespective of the number of poles, each
path supplying half the total current output. Wave-
wound generators produce high-voltage, low-
current outputs.
(b)
In lap windings there are as many paths in parallel
as the machine has poles. The total current output
divides equally between them. Lap-wound gener-
ators produce high-current, low-voltage output.
24.4 Shunt, series and compound
windings
When the ﬁeld windingof a d.c. machineis connectedin
parallel with the armature, as shown in Figure 24.4(a),
the machine is said to be shunt wound. If the ﬁeld
winding is connected in series with the armature, as
shown in Figure 24.4(b), then the machine is said to
be series wound. A compound wound machine has a
combination of series and shunt windings.
Figure 24.4

Part 3
374
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Depending on whether the electrical machine is series
wound, shunt wound or compound wound, it behaves
differently when a load is applied. The behaviour of
a d.c. machine under various conditions is shown by
means of graphs, called characteristic curves or just
characteristics. The characteristics shown in the fol-
lowing sections are theoretical, since they neglect the
effects of armature reaction.
Armature reaction is the effect that the magnetic
ﬁeld produced by the armature current has on the mag-
netic ﬁeld produced by the ﬁeld system. In a generator,
armature reaction results in a reduced output voltage,
and in a motor, armature reaction results in increased
speed.
A way of overcoming the effect of armature reaction
is to ﬁt compensating windings, located in slots in the
pole face.
24.5 E.m.f. generated in an
armature winding
Let Z =number of armature conductors,
=useful ﬂux per pole, in webers
p=number of pairs of poles
and n=armature speed in rev/s
The e.m.f. generated by the armature is equal to the
e.m.f. generated by one of the parallel paths. Each con-
ductor passes 2p poles per revolution and thus cuts 2p
webers of magnetic ﬂux per revolution. Hence ﬂux cut
by one conductor per second=2pn Wb and so the
average e.m.f. E generated per conductor is given by:
E = 2pn volts (since 1 volt=1 weber per second)
Let c = number of parallel paths through the winding
between positive and negative brushes
c = 2 for a wave winding
c = 2p for a lap winding
The number of conductors in series in each path= Z
c
The total e.m.f. between brushes

in series per path)

(1)
Since Z, p and c are constant for a given machine,
then E ∝n. However 2πn is the angular velocity ω
in radians per second, hence the generated e.m.f. is
proportional to  and ω, i.e.
generated e.m.f., E ∝
ω

armature with 50 slots with 16 conductors per slot.
The useful ﬂux per pole is 30mWb. Determine the
speed at which the machine must be driven to
generate an e.m.f. of 240V.
E =240V, c=2p (for a lap winding),
Z =50×16= 800, =30×10−3 Wb.

Problem 5.
A d.c. shunt-wound generator
running at constant speed generates a voltage of
150V at a certain value of ﬁeld current. Determine
the change in the generated voltage when the ﬁeld
current is reduced by 20%, assuming the ﬂux is
proportional to the ﬁeld current.
The generated e.m.f. E of a generator is proportional to
ω, i.e. is proportional to n, where  is the ﬂux and
n is the speed of rotation.
It follows that E =kn, where k is a constant.
At speed n1 and ﬂux 1, E1 =k1n1
At speed n2 and ﬂux 2, E2 =k2n2
Thus, by division:
E1
E2
= k1n1
k2n2
= 1n1
2n2
The initial conditions are E1=150V, =1 and
n=n1. When the ﬂux is reduced by 20%, the new
value of ﬂux is 80/100 or 0.8 of the initial value, i.e.
2 =0.81. Since the generator is running at constant
speed, n2 =n1
Thus
E1
E2
= 1n1
2n2
=
1n1
0.81n1
= 1
0.8
that is, E2 =150×0.8=120V
Thus, a reduction of 20% in the value of the ﬂuxreduces
the generated voltage to 120V at constant speed.
Problem 6.
A d.c. generator running at 30rev/s
generates an e.m.f. of 200V. Determine the
percentage increase in the ﬂux per pole required to
generate 250V at 20rev/s.
From equation (2), generated e.m.f., E ∝ω and since
ω=2πn, E ∝n
Let E1=200V, n1 =30rev/s and ﬂux per pole at this
speed be 1
Let E2 =250V, n1 =20rev/s and ﬂux per pole at this
speed be 2
Since E ∝n, then E1
E2
= 1n1
2n2
Hence
200
250 = 1(30)
2(20)
from which
2 = 1(30)(250)
(20)(200)
=1.8751

24.6 D.c. generators
D.c. generators are classiﬁed according to the method
of their ﬁeld excitation. These groupings are:
(i)
Separately excited generators, where the ﬁeld
winding is connected to a source of supply other
than the armature of its own machine.
(ii)
Self-excited generators, where the ﬁeld wind-
ing receives its supply from the armature of its
own machine, and which are sub-divided into
(a) shunt, (b) series and (c) compound wound
generators.

24.7 Types of d.c. generator
and their characteristics
(a)
Separately excited generator
A typical separately excited generator circuit is shown
in Figure 24.5.
Figure 24.5
When a load is connected across the armature termi-
nals, a load current Ia will ﬂow. The terminal voltage
V will fall from its open-circuit e.m.f. E due to a volt
drop caused by current ﬂowing through the armature
resistance, shown as Ra, i.e.
terminal voltage, V =E−IaRa
or
generated e.m.f., E= V +IaRa

Determine the terminal voltage of a
generator which develops an e.m.f. of 200 V and
has an armature current of 30 A on load. Assume
the armature resistance is 0.30 .
With reference to Figure 24.5, terminal voltage,
V = E −IaRa = 200 −(30)(0.30) = 200 −9
= 191 volts
Problem 8.
A generator is connected to a 60 
load and a current of 8 A ﬂows. If the armature
resistance is 1 , determine (a) the terminal voltage
and (b) the generated e.m.f.

Terminal voltage, V =IaRL =(8)(60)=480 volts
(b)
Generated e.m.f.,
E =V +IaRa

Problem 9.
A separately excited generator
develops a no-load e.m.f. of 150V at an armature
speed of 20rev/s and a ﬂux per pole of 0.10Wb.
Determine the generated e.m.f. when (a) the speed
increases to 25rev/s and the pole ﬂux remains
unchanged, (b) the speed remains at 20rev/s and the
pole ﬂux is decreased to 0.08Wb and (c) the speed
increases to 24rev/s and the pole ﬂux is decreased
to 0.07Wb.

(0.07)(24)
from which e.m.f., E4 = (150)(0.07)(24)

Characteristics
The two principal generator characteristics are the
generated voltage/ﬁeld current characteristics, called
the open-circuit characteristic and the terminal
voltage/load current characteristic, called the load
characteristic. A typical separately excited generator
open-circuit characteristic is shown in Figure 24.6(a)
and a
typical load characteristic is
shown in
Figure 24.6(b).
A separately excited generator is used only in special
cases, such as when a wide variation in terminal p.d. is
required, or when exact control of the ﬁeld current is
necessary. Its disadvantage lies in requiring a separate
source of direct current.

Shunt-wound generator
In a shunt-wound generator the ﬁeld winding is con-
nected in parallel with the armature, as shown in
Figure24.7.Theﬁeldwindinghasarelativelyhighresis-
tance and therefore the current carried is only a fraction
of the armature current.

=214.17 volts
Characteristics
The generated e.m.f., E, is proportional to ω (see
Section 24.5), hence at constant speed, since ω=2πn,
E ∝. Also the ﬂux  is proportional to ﬁeld current
If until magnetic saturation of the iron circuit of the
generator occurs. Hence the open circuit characteristic
is as shown in Figure 24.9(a).
Figure 24.9

Part 3
378
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
As the load current on a generator having constant
ﬁeld current and running at constant speed increases, the
value of armature current increases, hence the armature
volt drop, IaRa increases. The generated voltage E is
larger than the terminal voltage V and the voltage equa-
tion for the armature circuit is V =E −IaRa. Since E
is constant, V decreases with increasing load. The load
characteristic is as shown in Figure 24.9(b). In practice,
the fall in voltage is about 10% between no-load and
full-load for many d.c. shunt-wound generators.
The shunt-wound generator is the type most used
in practice, but the load current must be limited to a
value that is well below the maximum value. This then
avoids excessive variation of the terminal voltage. Typi-
cal applications are with battery charging and motor car
generators.
(c)
Series-wound generator
In the series-wound generator the ﬁeld winding is
connected in series with the armature as shown in
Figure 24.10.
Figure 24.10
Characteristics
The load characteristic is the terminal voltage/current
characteristic. The generated e.m.f., E, is proportional
to ω and at constant speed ω(=2πn) is a constant.
Thus E is proportional to . For values of current
below magnetic saturation of the yoke, poles, air gaps
and armature core, the ﬂux  is proportional to the
current, hence E ∝I. For values of current above those
required for magnetic saturation, the generated e.m.f. is
approximately constant. The values of ﬁeld resistance
and armature resistance in a series-wound machine are
small, hence the terminal voltage V is very nearly equal
to E. A typical load characteristic for a series generator
is shown in Figure 24.11.
Figure 24.11
In a series-wound generator, the ﬁeld winding is in
series with the armature and it is not possible to have
a value of ﬁeld current when the terminals are open
circuited, thus it is not possible to obtain an open-circuit
characteristic.
Series-wound generators are rarely used in practice,
but can be used as a ‘booster’ on d.c. transmission lines.
(d)
Compound-wound generator
In the compound-woundgenerator two methods of con-
nection are used, both having a mixture of shunt and
series windings, designed to combine the advantages
of each. Figure 24.12(a) shows what is termed a long-
shunt compound generator, and Figure 24.12(b) shows
a short-shunt compound generator. The latter is the
most generally used form of d.c. generator.

A short-shunt compound generator
supplies 80A at 200V. If the ﬁeld resistance,
Rf =40, the series resistance, RSe =0.02 and

e.m.f. generated.

Characteristics
In cumulative-compound machines the magnetic ﬂux
produced by the series and shunt ﬁelds are additive.
Included in this group are over-compounded, level-
compounded and under-compounded machines – the
degree of compounding obtained depending on the
number of turns of wire on the series winding.
A large number of series winding turns results
in an over-compounded characteristic, as shown in
Figure 24.14, in which the full-load terminal volt-
age exceeds the no-load voltage. A level-compound
machine gives a full-load terminal voltage which is
equal to the no-load voltage, as shown in Figure 24.14.
Figure 24.14
An under-compounded machine gives a full-load
terminal voltage which is less than the no-load voltage,
as shown in Figure 24.14. However, even this latter
characteristic is a little better than that for a shunt
generator alone.
Compound-wound generators are used in electric arc
welding, with lighting sets and with marine equipment.

certain losses occur which are dissipated in the form
of heat.
The principal losses of machines are:

Copper loss, due to I 2R heat losses in the
armature and ﬁeld windings.
(ii)
Iron (or core) loss, due to hysteresis and eddy-
current losses in the armature. This loss can be
reduced by constructing the armature of silicon
steel laminationshavinga high resistivity and low
hysteresis loss. At constant speed, the iron loss is
assumed constant.
(iii)
Friction and windage losses, due to bearing and
brush contact friction and losses due to air resis-
tance against moving parts (called windage). At
constant speed, these losses are assumed to be
constant.
(iv)
Brushcontactloss betweenthebrushesandcom-
mutator. This loss is approximately proportional
to the load current.
The total losses of a machine can be quite signiﬁcant
and operating efﬁciencies of between 80% and 90% are
common.
24.9 Efﬁciency of a d.c. generator
The efﬁciency of an electrical machine is the ratio of the
output power to the input power and is usually expressed
as a percentage. The Greek letter ‘η’ (eta) is used to
signify efﬁciency and since the units are power/power,
then efﬁciency has no units. Thus
efﬁciency, η =

If the total resistance of the armature circuit (including
brush contact resistance) is Ra, then the total loss in
the armature circuit is I2
aRa
If the terminal voltage is V and the current in the
shunt circuit is If , then the loss in the shunt circuit is
If V
If the sum of the iron, friction and windage losses is C
then the total losses is given by:
I2
aRa + If V + C
(I 2
a Ra + If V is, in fact, the ‘copper loss’)
If the output current is I, then the output power is VI.

24.10 D.c. motors
The construction of a d.c. motor is the same as a d.c.
generator. The only difference is that in a generator the
generated e.m.f. is greater than the terminal voltage,
whereas in a motor the generated e.m.f. is less than the
terminal voltage.
D.c. motors are often used in power stations to
drive emergency stand-by pump systems which come
into operation to protect essential equipment and plant
should the normal a.c. supplies or pumps fail.
Back e.m.f.
When a d.c. motor rotates, an e.m.f. is induced in the
armature conductors. By Lenz’s law this induced e.m.f.
E opposes the supply voltage V and is called a back
e.m.f., and the supply voltage V is given by:
V = E + IaRa
or
E = V−IaRa

Problem 13.
A d.c. motor operates from a 240V
supply. The armature resistance is 0.2. Determine
the back e.m.f. when the armature current is 50A.
For a motor, V =E +IaRa

From equation (5), for a d.c. motor, the supply voltage

The term VIa is the total electrical power supplied to
the armature, the term I2
a Ra is the loss due to arma-
ture resistance and the term EIa is the mechanical

Hence T ω=2πnT =EIa, from which

From equation (8), the shaft torque T of a generator is
proportional to Ia, where  is the ﬂux and Ia is the

24.12 Types of d.c. motor
and their characteristics

Shunt-wound motor

allel with the armature across the supply, as shown in
Figure 24.16.

=28.4A
(b)
Back e.m.f., E =V −IaRa
= 240−(28.4)(0.4)
= 228.64 volts
Characteristics
The two principal characteristics are the torque/
armature current and speed/armature current relation-
ships. From these, the torque/speed relationship can be
derived.
(i)
The theoretical torque/armature current char-
acteristic can be derived from the expression
T ∝Ia (see Section 24.11). For a shunt-wound
motor, the ﬁeld winding is connected in paral-
lel with the armature circuit and thus the applied
voltage gives a constant ﬁeld current,i.e.a shunt-
wound motor is a constant ﬂux machine. Since
 is constant, it follows that T ∝Ia, and the
characteristic is as shown in Figure 24.17.
Figure 24.17
(ii)
The armature circuit of a d.c. motor has resis-
tance due to the armature winding and brushes,
Ra ohms, and when armature current Ia is ﬂow-
ing through it, there is a voltage drop of IaRa
volts. In Figure 24.16 the armature resistance is
shown as a separate resistor in the armature cir-
cuit to help understanding. Also, even though
the machine is a motor, because conductors are
rotating in a magnetic ﬁeld, a voltage, E ∝ω,
is generated by the armature conductors. From
equation (5), V =E +IaRa or E =V −IaRa
However, from Section 24.5, E ∝n, hence
n∝E/, i.e.
speed of rotation, n ∝E

 ∝V −I aRa

(9)
For a shunt motor, V ,  and Ra are constants,
hence as armature current Ia increases, IaRa
increases and V −IaRa decreases, and the speed
is proportional to a quantity which is decreas-
ing and is as shown in Figure 24.18. As the
load on the shaft of the motor increases, Ia
increases and the speed drops slightly. In prac-
tice, the speed falls by about 10% between
no-load and full-load on many d.c. shunt-wound
motors. Due to this relatively small drop in
Figure 24.18

Part 3
D.c. machines

speed, the d.c. shunt-wound motor is taken
as basically being a constant-speed machine
and may be used for driving lathes, lines of
shafts, fans, conveyor belts, pumps, compres-
sors, drilling machines and so on.
(iii)
Since torque is proportional to armature cur-
rent (see (i) above), the theoretical speed/torque
characteristic is as shown in Figure 24.19.
Figure 24.19
Problem 21.
A 200V d.c. shunt-wound motor
has an armature resistance of 0.4 and at a certain
load has an armature current of 30A and runs at
1350rev/min. If the load on the shaft of the motor is
increased so that the armature current increases to
45A, determine the speed of the motor, assuming
the ﬂux remains constant.
The relationship E ∝n applies to both generators and
motors. For a motor,
E = V −IaRa (see equation 5)
Hence E1 = 200−30×0.4=188V
and
E2 = 200−45×0.4=182V
The relationship, E1
E2
= 1n1
2n2
applies to both generators and motors. Since the ﬂux is
constant, 1 =2.
Hence 188
182 =

1350
60

1 × n2
, i.e. n2 = 22.5 × 182
188
=21.78rev/s
Thus the speed of the motor when the armature current
is 45A is 21.78×60rev/min, i.e. 1307rev/min.
Problem 22.
A 220V d.c. shunt-wound motor
runs at 800rev/min and the armature current is
30A. The armature circuit resistance is 0.4.
Determine (a) the maximum value of armature
current if the ﬂux is suddenly reduced by 10% and
(b) the steady state value of the armature current at
the new value of ﬂux, assuming the shaft torque of
the motor remains constant.
(a)
For a d.c. shunt-wound motor, E =V −IaRa.
Hence initial generated e.m.f.,E1 =220−30×0.4
=208V. The generated e.m.f. is also such that
E ∝n, so at the instant the ﬂux is reduced,
the speed has not had time to change, and
E =208×90/100=187.2V.
Hence, the voltage drop due to the armature
resistance is 220−187.2, i.e. 32.8V. The instan-
taneous value of the current is 32.8/0.4, i.e.
82A. This increase in current is about three times
the initial value and causes an increase in torque,
(T ∝Ia). The motor accelerates because of the
larger torque value until steady state conditions are
reached.
(b)
T ∝Ia and since the torque is constant,
1Ia1 =2Ia2. The ﬂux  is reduced by 10%,
hence
2 = 0.91
Thus, 1 ×30=0.91×Ia2
i.e. the steady state value of armature current,
Ia2 = 30
0.9 = 331

Series-wound motor
In the series-wound motor the ﬁeld winding is in
series with the armature across the supply as shown in
Figure 24.20.

Part 3
386
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
For the series motor shown in Figure 24.20,
Supply voltage, V = E + I(Ra + Rf )
or generated e.m.f., E =V −I(Ra + Rf )
Characteristics
In a series motor, the armature current ﬂows in the ﬁeld
winding and is equal to the supply current, I.
(i)
The torque/current characteristic
It is shown in Section 24.11that torqueT ∝Ia.
Since the armature and ﬁeld currents are the
same current, I, in a series machine, then
T ∝I over a limited range, before magnetic
saturation of the magnetic circuit of the motor
is reached (i.e. the linear portion of the B–H
curve for the yoke, poles, air gap, brushes and
armature in series). Thus ∝I and T ∝I 2.
After magnetic saturation,  almost becomes
a constant and T ∝I. Thus the theoretical
torque/current characteristic is as shown in
Figure 24.21.
Figure 24.21
(ii)
The speed/current characteristic
Itisshowninequation (9)thatn∝(V −IaRa)/.
In a series motor, Ia =I and below the magnetic
saturation level, ∝I. Thus n∝(V −IR)/I
where R is the combined resistance of the series
ﬁeld and armature circuit. Since IR is small
compared with V , then an approximate rela-
tionship for the speed is n∝V /I ∝1/I since V
is constant. Hence the theoretical speed/current
characteristic is as shown in Figure 24.22. The
high speed at small values of current indicate
that this type of motor must not be run on very
light loads and, invariably, such motors are
permanently coupled to their loads.
(iii)
The theoretical speed/torque characteristic may
be derived from (i) and (ii) above by obtaining
the torque and speed for various values of cur-
rent and plotting the co-ordinates on the speed/
Figure 24.22
torque characteristics. A typical speed/torque
characteristic is shown in Figure 24.23.
Figure 24.23
A d.c. series motor takes a large current on start-
ing and the characteristic shown in Figure 24.21
shows that the series-wound motor has a large
torque when the current is large. Hence these
motors are used for traction (such as trains, milk
delivery vehicles, etc.), driving fans and for
cranes and hoists, where a large initial torque is
required.
Problem 23.
A series motor has an armature
resistance of 0.2 and a series ﬁeld resistance of
0.3. It is connected to a 240V supply and at a
particular load runs at24 rev/s when drawing 15 A
from the supply.
(a)
Determine the generated e.m.f. at this load.
(b)
Calculate the speed of the motor when the
load is changed such that the current is
increased to 30 A. Assume that this causes a
doubling of the ﬂux.
(a)
With reference to Figure 24.20, generated e.m.f.,
E, at initial load, is given by
E1 = V −Ia(Ra + Rf )
= 240 −(15)(0.2+ 0.3) = 240 −7.5
= 232.5volts
(b)
When the current is increased to 30 A, the gener-
ated e.m.f. is given by:

Part 3
D.c. machines
387
E2 = V −Ia(Ra + Rf )
= 240 −(30)(0.2 + 0.3) = 240 −15

(21)(n2) since 2 =21
Hence speed of motor, n2 = (24)(225)
(232.5)(2)
= 11.6rev/s
As the current has been increased from 15A
to 30A, the speed has decreased from 24rev/s
to 11.6rev/s. Its speed/current characteristic is
similar to Figure 24.22.
(c)
Compound-wound motor
There are two types of compound-wound motor:
(i)
Cumulative compound, in which the series
winding is so connected that the ﬁeld due to it
assists that due to the shunt winding.
(ii)
Differential compound, in which the series
winding is so connected that the ﬁeld due to it
opposes that due to the shunt winding.
Figure 24.24(a) shows a long-shunt compound motor
and Figure 24.24(b) a short-shunt compound motor.
Figure 24.24
Characteristics
A compound-woundmotor has both a series and a shunt
ﬁeld winding (i.e. one winding in series and one in par-
allel with the armature), and is usually wound to have a
characteristic similar in shape to a series-wound motor
(see Figures 24.21–24.23). A limited amount of shunt
winding is present to restrict the no-load speed to a safe
value. However, by varying the number of turns on the
series and shunt windings and the directions of the mag-
netic ﬁelds produced by these windings (assisting or
opposing), families of characteristics may be obtained
to suit almost all applications. Generally, compound-
wound motors are used for heavy duties, particularly
in applications where sudden heavy load may occur,
such as for driving plunger pumps, presses, geared lifts,
conveyors, hoists and so on.
Typical compound motor torque and speed characteris-
tics are shown in Figure 24.25.

24.14 D.c. motor starter
If a d.c. motor whose armature is stationary is switched
directly to its supply voltage, it is likely that the fuses
protecting the motor will burn out. This is because the
armature resistance is small, frequently being less than
one ohm. Thus, additional resistance must be added to
the armature circuit at the instant of closing the switch
to start the motor.
As the speed of the motor increases, the armature con-
ductors are cutting ﬂux and a generated voltage, acting
in opposition to the applied voltage, is produced, which
limits the ﬂow of armature current. Thus the value of
the additional armature resistance can then be reduced.

Part 3
390
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
When at normal running speed, the generated e.m.f.
is such that no additional resistance is required in the
armature circuit. To achieve this varying resistance in
the armature circuit on starting, a d.c. motor starter is
used, as shown in Figure 24.28.
Figure 24.28
The starting handle is moved slowly in a clockwise
direction to start the motor. For a shunt-wound motor,
the ﬁeld winding is connected to stud 1 or to L via a slid-
ingcontactonthestartinghandle,togivemaximumﬁeld
current, hence maximum ﬂux, hence maximum torque
on starting, since T ∝Ia
A similar arrangement without the ﬁeld connection is
used for series motors.
24.15 Speed control of d.c. motors
Shunt-wound motors
The speed of a shunt-wound d.c. motor, n, is propor-
tional to (V −IaRa)/ (see equation (9)). The speed is
varied either by varying the value of ﬂux, , or by vary-
ing the value of Ra. The former is achieved by using
a variable resistor in series with the ﬁeld winding, as
shown in Figure 24.29(a) and such a resistor is called
the shunt ﬁeld regulator. As the value of resistance of
the shunt ﬁeld regulator is increased, the value of the
ﬁeld current, If , is decreased.
This results in a decrease in the value of ﬂux, ,
and hence an increase in the speed, since n∝1/.
Thus only speeds above that given without a shunt
ﬁeld regulator can be obtained by this method. Speeds
below those given by (V −IaRa)/ are obtained by
increasing the resistance in the armature circuit, as
shown in Figure 24.29(b), where
n ∝V −Ia(Ra + R)

Since resistor R is in series with the armature, it
carries the full armature current and results in a large
Figure 24.29
power loss in large motors where a considerable speed
reduction is required for long periods.
These methods of speed control are demonstrated in the
following worked problem.

is 120A. The armature resistance is 0.2.

Determine the speed when the current is 60A
and a resistance of 0.5 is connected in series
with the armature, the shunt ﬁeld remaining
constant.
(b)
Determine the speed when the current is 60A
and the shunt ﬁeld is reduced to 80% of its
normal value by increasing resistance in the
ﬁeld circuit.


where k is a constant, V is the terminal voltage,
R is the combined resistance of the armature and
series ﬁeld and  is the ﬂux.
Thus, a reduction in ﬂux results in an increase
in speed. This is achieved by putting a variable
resistance in parallel with the ﬁeld winding and
reducing the ﬁeld current, and hence ﬂux, for a
given value of supply current. A circuit diagram
of this arrangement is shown in Figure 24.30(a).
A variable resistor connected in parallel with the
series-wound ﬁeld to control speed is called a
diverter.Speedsabovethosegivenwithnodiverter
are obtained by this method. Worked Problem 29
below demonstrates this method.

With the 0.2 diverter in parallel with Rse (see

R = (0.2)(0.05)

from which, extra series resistance, R =4.45−0.6

24.16 Motor cooling
Motors are often classiﬁed according to the type of
enclosure used, the type depending on the conditions
under which the motor is used and the degree of
ventilation required.
The most common type of protection is the screen-
protected type, where ventilation is achieved by ﬁtting
a fan internally, with the openings at the end of the motor
ﬁtted with wire mesh.
A drip-proof type is similar to the screen-protected
type but has a cover over the screen to prevent drips of
water entering the machine.
A ﬂame-proof type is usually cooled by the conduction
of heat through the motor casing.
With a pipe-ventilated type, air is piped into the motor
from a dust-freearea, and an internally ﬁtted fan ensures
the circulation of this cool air.

Chapter 25
Three-phase induction
motors
Why it is important to understand: Three-phase induction motors
The induction motor is a three-phase a.c. motor and is the most widely used machine in industrial
applications. Its characteristic features are simple and rugged construction, low cost and minimum main-
tenance, high reliability and sufﬁciently high efﬁciency, and needs no extra starting motor and need not
be synchronized. An induction motor, also called an asynchronous motor, is an a.c. motor in which all
electromagnetic energy is transferred by inductive coupling from a primary winding to a secondary
winding, the two windings being separated by an air gap. In three-phase induction motors that are inher-
ently self-starting, energy transfer is usually from the stator to either a wound rotor or a short-circuited
squirrel cage rotor. Three-phase cage rotor induction motors are widely used in industrial drives because
they are rugged, reliable and economical. Single-phase induction motors are also used extensively for
smaller loads. Although most a.c. motors have long been used in ﬁxed-speed load drive service, they
are increasingly being used in variable-frequency drive (VFD) service, variable-torque centrifugal fan,
pump and compressor loads being by far the most important energy-saving applications for VFD ser-
vice. Squirrel cage induction motors are most commonly used in both ﬁxed-speed and VFD applications.
This chapter explains the principle of operation of the different types of three-phase induction motors.
Calculations of slip and losses and efﬁciency are also included. Methods of starting induction motors are
also discussed.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•

•

•

25.1 Introduction
In d.c. motors, introduced in Chapter 24, conductors on
a rotating armature pass through a stationary magnetic
ﬁeld. In a three-phase induction motor, the magnetic
ﬁeld rotates and this has the advantage that no exter-
nal electrical connections to the rotor need be made.
Its name is derived from the fact that the current in the
rotor is induced by the magnetic ﬁeld instead of being
supplied through electrical connections to the supply.
The result is a motor which: (i) is cheap and robust, (ii) is
explosion proof, due to the absence of a commutator
or slip-rings and brushes with their associated sparking,
(iii) requires little or no skilled maintenance and (iv) has
self-starting properties when switched to a supply with
no additional expenditure on auxiliary equipment. The
principal disadvantage of a three-phase induction motor
is that its speed cannot be readily adjusted.
25.2 Production of a rotating
magnetic ﬁeld
When a three-phase supply is connected to symmetrical
three-phase windings, the currents ﬂowing in the wind-
ings produce a magnetic ﬁeld. This magnetic ﬁeld is
constant in magnitude and rotates at constant speed as
shown below, and is called the synchronous speed.
With reference to Figure 25.1, the windings are
represented by three single-loop conductors, one for
each phase, marked RSRF , YSYF and BSBF , the S and
F signifying start and ﬁnish. In practice, each phase
winding comprises many turns and is distributed around
the stator; the single-loop approach is for clarity only.
When the stator windings are connected to a three-
phase supply, the current ﬂowing in each winding varies
with time and is as shown in Figure 25.1(a). If the value
Figure 25.1

Part 3
Three-phase induction motors
395
of current in a winding is positive, the assumption is
made that it ﬂows from start to ﬁnish of the winding,
i.e. if it is the red phase, current ﬂows from RS to
RF , i.e. away from the viewer in RS and towards the
viewer in RF . When the value of current is negative, the
assumption is made that it ﬂows from ﬁnish to start, i.e.
towards the viewer in an ‘S’ winding and away from
the viewer in an ‘F’ winding. At time, say t1, shown
in Figure 25.1(a), the current ﬂowing in the red phase
is a maximum positive value. At the same time, t1, the
currents ﬂowing in the yellow and blue phases are both
0.5 times the maximum value and are negative.
The current distribution in the stator windings is
therefore as shown in Figure 25.1(b), in which current
ﬂows away from the viewer (shown as ⊗) in RS since
it is positive, but towards the viewer (shown as ⊙) in
YS and BS, since these are negative. The resulting mag-
netic ﬁeld is as shown, due to the ‘solenoid’ action and
application of the corkscrew rule.
A short time later at time t2, the current ﬂowing in the
red phase has fallen to about 0.87 times its maximum
value and is positive, the current in the yellow phase
is zero and the current in the blue phase is about 0.87
times its maximum value and is negative. Hence the
currents and resultant magnetic ﬁeld are as shown in
Figure 25.1(c). At time t3, the currents in the red and
yellow phases are 0.5 of their maximum values and the
current in the blue phase is a maximum negative value.
The currents and resultant magnetic ﬁeld are as shown
in Figure 25.1(d).
Similar diagrams to Figure 25.1(b), (c) and (d) can
be produced for all time values and these would show
that the magnetic ﬁeld travels through one revolution
for each cycle of the supply voltage applied to the stator
windings. By considering the ﬂux values rather than
the current values, it is shown below that the rotating
magnetic ﬁeld has a constant value of ﬂux. The three
coils shown in Figure 25.2(a) are connected in star to
a three-phase supply. Let the positive directions of the
ﬂuxes produced by currents ﬂowing in the coils, be φ A,
φB and φC, respectively. The directions of φA, φB and
φC do not alter, but their magnitudes are proportional to
the currents ﬂowing in the coils at any particular time.
At time t1, shown in Figure 25.2(b),the currents ﬂowing
in the coils are:
iB, a maximum positive value, i.e. the ﬂux is
towards point P;
iA and iC, half the maximum value and negative,
i.e. the ﬂux is away from point P.
These currentsgive rise to the magneticﬂuxes φA, φB
and φC, whose magnitudes and directions are as shown
Figure 25.2
in Figure 25.2(c).The resultant ﬂux is the phasor sum of
φA, φB and φC, shown as  in Figure 25.2(c). At time
t2, the currents ﬂowing are:
iB, 0.866×maximum positive value, iC, zero, and
iA, 0.866×maximum negative value.
The magnetic ﬂuxes and the resultant magnetic ﬂux are
as shown in Figure 25.2(d).
At time t3, iB is 0.5×maximum value and is positive
iA is a maximum negative value, and
iC is 0.5×maximum value and is positive.

Part 3
396
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
The magnetic ﬂuxes and the resultant magnetic ﬂux are
as shown in Figure 25.2(e).
Inspection of Figures 25.2(c), (d) and (e) shows that
the magnitude of the resultant magnetic ﬂux, , in each
case is constant and is 1 1
2 ×the maximum value of φA,
φB or φC, but that its direction is changing. The process
of determining the resultant ﬂux may be repeated for
all values of time and shows that the magnitude of the
resultant ﬂux is constant for all values of time and also
that it rotates at constant speed, making one revolution
for each cycle of the supply voltage.
25.3 Synchronous speed
The rotating magnetic ﬁeld produced by three-phase
windings could have been produced by rotating a per-
manent magnet’s north and south pole at synchronous
speed, (shown as N and S at the ends of the ﬂux pha-
sors in Figures 25.1(b), (c) and (d)). For this reason, it is
called a two-pole system and an induction motor using
three-phase windings only is calleda two-pole induction
motor.
If six windings displaced from one another by 60 ◦
are used, as shown in Figure 25.3(a), by drawing the
Figure 25.3
current and resultant magnetic ﬁeld diagrams at various
time values, it may be shown that one cycle of the supply
current to the stator windings causes the magnetic ﬁeld
to move through half a revolution. The current distribu-
tion in the stator windings are shown in Figure 25.3(a),
for the time t shown in Figure 25.3(b).
It can be seen that for six windings on the stator, the
magnetic ﬂux produced is the same as that produced
by rotating two permanent magnet north poles and two
permanent magnet south poles at synchronous speed.
This is called a four-polesystem and an induction motor
using six-phase windings is called a four-pole induction
motor. By increasing the number of phase windings the
number of poles can be increased to any even number.
In general, if f is the frequency of the currents in the
stator windings and the stator is wound to be equiva-
lent to p pairs of poles, the speed of revolution of the
rotating magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. the synchronous speed, n s is
given by:
ns = f
p rev/s
Problem 1.
A three-phase two-pole induction
motor is connected to a 50Hz supply. Determine
the synchronous speed of the motor in rev/min.
From above, ns =f/p rev/s, where ns is the synchro-
nous speed, f is the frequency in hertz of the supply to
the stator and p is the number of pairs of poles. Since
the motor is connected to a 50 hertz supply, f =50. The
motor has a two-pole system, hence p, the number of
pairs of poles is one.
Thus, synchronous speed, ns = 50
1 = 50 rev/s
= 50 × 60 rev/min
= 3000 rev/min
Problem 2.
A stator winding supplied from a
three-phase 60 Hz system is required to produce a
magnetic ﬂux rotating at 900rev/min. Determine
the number of poles.

25.4 Construction of a three-phase
induction motor
The stator of a three-phase induction motor is the sta-
tionary part correspondingto the yoke of a d.c. machine.
It is wound to give a two-pole, four-pole,six-pole, ......
rotating magnetic ﬁeld, depending on the rotor speed
required. The rotor, corresponding to the armature of
a d.c. machine, is built up of laminated iron, to reduce
eddy currents.
In the type most widely used, known as a squirrel-
cage rotor,copper or aluminium bars are placed in slots
cut in the laminated iron, the ends of the bars being
welded or brazed into a heavy conducting ring (see
Figure 25.4(a)). A cross-sectional view of a three-phase
induction motor is shown in Figure 25.4(b).
The conductors are placed in slots in the laminated
iron rotor core. If the slots are skewed, better starting
Figure 25.4
and quieter running is achieved. This type of rotor has
no external connections, which means that slip-rings
and brushes are not needed. The squirrel-cage motor is
cheap, reliable and efﬁcient.
Another type of rotor is the wound rotor. With this
type there are phase windings in slots, similar to those
in the stator. The windings may be connected in star
or delta and the connections made to three slip-rings.
The slip-rings are used to add external resistance to
the rotor circuit, particularly for starting (see Section
25.13), but for normal running the slip-rings are short
circuited.
The principle of operation is the same for both the
squirrel-cage and the wound rotor machines.
25.5 Principle of operation of a
three-phase induction motor
When a three-phase supply is connected to the stator
windings, a rotating magnetic ﬁeld is produced. As the
magnetic ﬂux cuts a bar on the rotor,an e.m.f. is induced
in it and since it is joined, via the end conducting rings,
to another bar one pole pitch away, a current ﬂows in
the bars. The magnetic ﬁeld associated with this current
ﬂowing in the bars interacts with the rotating magnetic
ﬁeld and a force is produced, tending to turn the rotor
in the same direction as the rotating magnetic ﬁeld,
(see Figure 25.5). Similar forces are applied to all the
conductors on the rotor, so that a torque is produced,
causing the rotor to rotate.

Part 3
398
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Figure 25.5
25.6 Slip
The force exerted by the rotor bars causes the rotor to
turn in the direction of the rotating magnetic ﬁeld. As
the rotor speed increases, the rate at which the rotating
magnetic ﬁeld cuts the rotor bars is less and the fre-
quency of the induced e.m.f.s in the rotor bars is less. If
the rotor runs at the same speed as the rotating magnetic
ﬁeld, no e.m.f.s are induced in the rotor, hence there is
no force on them and no torque on the rotor. Thus the
rotor slows down. For this reason the rotor can never
run at synchronous speed.
When there is no load on the rotor, the resistive forces
due to windage and bearing friction are small and the
rotor runs very nearly at synchronous speed. As the rotor
is loaded, the speed falls and this causes an increase in
the frequency of the induced e.m.f.s in the rotor bars
and hence the rotor current, force and torque increase.
The difference between the rotor speed, nr, and the
synchronous speed, ns, is called the slip speed, i.e.
slip speed=ns −nr rev/s
The ratio (ns −nr)/ns is called the fractional slip or
just the slip, s, and is usually expressed as a percentage.
Thus
slip, s =
ns−nr

×100%
Typical values of slip between no load and full load are
about 4 to 5% for small motors and 1.5 to 2% for large
motors.

i.e. the rotor runs at 58.8×60 = 3528 rev/min
(c)
Since the synchronousspeed is 60 rev/s and that of
the rotor is 58.8rev/s, the rotating magnetic ﬁeld

25.7 Rotor e.m.f. and frequency
Rotor e.m.f.
When an induction motor is stationary, the stator and
rotor windings form the equivalent of a transformer, as

E2 =
N2
N1

E1
(1)
where E1 is the supply voltage per phase to the stator.
When an induction motor is running, the induced
e.m.f. in the rotor is less since the relative movement
between conductors and the rotating ﬁeld is less. The
induced e.m.f. is proportional to this movement, hence
it must be proportional to the slip, s.
Hence when running, rotor e.m.f. per phase

Problem 13.
For the induction motor of Problems
10 to 12, determine the resistance of the rotor
winding required for maximum starting torque.
From equation (4), rotor reactance Xr= sX2
At the moment of starting, slip, s = 1
Maximum
torque
occurs
when
rotor
reactance
equals rotor resistance; hence for maximum torque,
R2 = Xr = sX2 = X2 = 3.5
Thus if the induction motor was a wound rotor type with
slip-rings then an external star-connected resistance of
(3.5−0.35) = 3.15 per phase could be added to the
rotor resistance to give maximum torque at starting (see
Section 25.13).
Now try the following Practice Exercise
Practice Exercise 117
The torque equation
(Answers on page 825)
1.
A 400V, three-phase, 50Hz, two-pole, star-
connected induction motor runs at 48.5rev/s
on full load. The rotor resistance and reactance
per phase are 0.4 and 4.0, respectively,
and the effective rotor–stator turns ratio is
0.8:1. Calculate (a) the synchronous speed,
(b) the slip, (c) the full load torque, (d) the
power output if mechanical losses amount to
500W, (e) the maximum torque, (f) the speed
at which maximum torque occurs, and (g) the
starting torque.

For the induction motor in Problem 1, calcu-
late at full load (a) the rotor current, (b) the
rotor copper loss and (c) the starting current.
3.
If the stator losses for the induction motor in
Problem 1 are 525 W, calculate at full load
(a) the power input, (b) the efﬁciency of the
motorand(c)thecurrenttakenfromthesupply
if the motor runs at a power factor of 0.84
4.
For the induction motor in Problem 1, deter-
mine the resistance of the rotor winding
required for maximum starting torque.
25.12 Induction motor torque–speed
characteristics
From Problem 10, parts (c) and (g), it is seen that the nor-
mal starting torque may be less than the full load torque.
Also,fromProblem10,parts(e)and(f),itisseenthatthe
speed at which maximum torque occurs is determined
by the value of the rotor resistance. At synchronous
speed, slip s = 0 and torque is zero. From these obser-
vations, the torque-speedand torque-slip characteristics
of an induction motor are as shown in Figure 25.9.
The rotor resistance of an induction motor is usu-
ally small compared with its reactance (for example,
R2 = 0.35 and X2 = 3.5 in the above problems), so
that maximum torque occurs at a high speed, typically
about 80% of synchronous speed.

Part 3
Three-phase induction motors

Figure 25.9
Curve P in Figure 25.9 is a typical characteristic for
an inductionmotor. The curve P cuts the full load torque
line at point X, showing that at full load the slip is about
4–5%. The normal operating conditions are between
0 and X, thus it can be seen that for normal operation the
speed variation with load is quite small – the induction
motor is an almost constant-speed machine. Redraw-
ing the speed–torque characteristic between 0 and X
gives the characteristic shown in Figure 25.10, which is
similar to a d.c. shunt motor as shown in Chapter 24.
Figure 25.10
If maximum torque is required at starting then a high
resistance rotor is necessary, which gives characteristic
Q in Figure 25.9. However,as can be seen, the motor has
a full load slip of over 30%, which results in a drop in
efﬁciency. Also, such a motor has a large speed variation
withvariationsofload.CurvesRandSofFigure25.9are
characteristics for values of rotor resistances between
those of P and Q. Better starting torque than for curve
P is obtained, but with lower efﬁciency and with speed
variations under operating conditions.
A squirrel-cage induction motor would normally
follow characteristic P. This type of machine is highly
efﬁcient and about constant-speed under normal run-
ning conditions. However, it has a poor starting torque
and must be started off-load or very lightly loaded (see
Section 25.13 below). Also, on starting, the current can
be four or ﬁve times the normal full load current, due
to the motor acting like a transformer with secondary
short-circuited. In Problem 11, for example, the current
at starting was nearly three times the full load current.
A wound-rotorinduction motor would followchar-
acteristic P when the slip-rings are short-circuited,
which is the normal running condition. However, the
slip-rings allow for the addition of resistance to the
rotor circuit externally and, as a result, for starting, the
motor can have a characteristic similar to curve Q in
Figure 25.9 and the high starting current experienced
by the cage induction motor can be overcome.
In general, for three-phase induction motors, the
power factor is usually between about 0.8 and 0.9
lagging, and the full load efﬁciency is usually about
80–90%
From equation (12) it is seen that torque is propor-
tional to the square of the supply voltage. Any voltage
variations therefore would seriously affect the induction
motor performance.
25.13 Starting methods for induction
motors
Squirrel-cage rotor
(i)
Direct-on-line starting
With this method, starting current is high and
may cause interference with supplies to other
consumers.

Part 3
406
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Figure 25.11
(ii)
Auto transformer starting
With this method, an auto transformer is used
to reduce the stator voltage, E1, and thus the
starting current (see equation (7)). However,
the starting torque is seriously reduced (see
equation (12)), so the voltage is reduced only
sufﬁciently to give the required reduction of the
starting current. A typical arrangement is shown
in Figure 25.11. A double-throw switch connects
the auto transformer in circuit for starting, and
when the motor is up to speed the switch is
moved to the run position, which connects the
supply directly to the motor.
(iii)
Star–delta starting
With this method for starting, the connections
to the stator phase winding are star-connected,
so that the voltage across each phase winding is
1/√3 (i.e. 0.577) of the line voltage. For running,
the windings are switched to delta connection.
A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 25.12.
This method of starting is less expensive than by
auto transformer.
Wound rotor
When starting on load is necessary, a wound rotor induc-
tion motor must be used. This is because maximum
torque at starting can be obtained by adding external
resistance to the rotor circuit via slip-rings (see Prob-
lem 13). A face-plate type starter is used, and as the
resistance is gradually reduced, the machine character-
istics at each stage will be similar to Q, S, R and P of
Figure 25.13. At each resistance step, the motor opera-
tion will transfer from one characteristic to the next so
that the overall starting characteristic will be as shown
by the bold line in Figure 25.13.For very large induction
motors, very gradual and smooth starting is achieved by
a liquid-type resistance.
25.14 Advantages of squirrel-cage
induction motors
The advantages of squirrel-cage motors compared with
the wound rotor type are that they:
Figure 25.12

Part 3
Three-phase induction motors
407
Figure 25.13
(i)
are cheaper and more robust
(ii)
have slightly higher efﬁciency and power factor
(iii)
are explosion-proof, since the risk of sparking
is eliminated by the absence of slip-rings and
brushes.
25.15 Advantages of wound rotor
induction motor
Theadvantagesofthewoundrotormotorcomparedwith
the cage type are that they:
(i)
have a much higher starting torque
(ii)
have a much lower starting current
(iii)
have a means of varying speed by use of external
rotor resistance.
25.16 Double cage induction motor
The advantages of squirrel-cage and wound rotor induc-
tion motors are combined in the double cage induction
motor. This type of induction motor is specially con-
structed with the rotor having two cages, one inside the
other. The outer cage has high-resistance conductors
so that maximum torque is achieved at or near starting.
The inner cage has normal low-resistance copper con-
ductors but high reactance since it is embedded deep
in the iron core. The torque–speed characteristic of the
inner cage is that of a normal induction motor, as shown
in Figure 25.14. At starting, the outer cage produces
the torque, but when running the inner cage produces
the torque. The combined characteristic of inner and
outer cages is shown in Figure 25.14. The double cage
induction motor is highly efﬁcient when running.
Figure 25.14
25.17 Uses of three-phase induction
motors
Three-phase induction motors are widely used in indus-
try and constitute almost all industrial drives where a
nearly constant speed is required, from small workshops
to the largest industrial enterprises.
Typical applications are with machine tools, pumps
and mill motors. The squirrel cage rotor type is the most
widely used of all a.c. motors.

Revision of complex numbers
Why it is important to understand: Complex numbers
Complex numbers are used in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds, including engineering, electromagnetism, quantum
physics and applied mathematics, such as chaos theory. Any physical motion which is periodic, such as
an oscillating beam, string, wire, pendulum, electronic signal or electromagnetic wave can be represented
by a complex number function. This can make calculations with the various components simpler than
with real numbers and sines and cosines. In control theory, systems are often transformed from the time
domain to the frequency domain using the Laplace transform. In ﬂuid dynamics, complex functions are
used to describe potential ﬂow in two dimensions. In electrical engineering, the Fourier transform is used
to analyse varying voltages and currents. Complex numbers are used in signal analysis and other ﬁelds
for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. This use is also extended into digital signal
processing and digital image processing, which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and wavelet
analysis) to transmit, compress, restore and otherwise process digital audio signals, still images and video
signals. Knowledge of complex numbers is clearly absolutely essential for further studies in so many
engineering disciplines and is used extensively in many of the ensuing chapters.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a complex number
•
understand the Argand diagram
•
perform calculations on addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in Cartesian and polar forms
•
use De Moivre’s theorem for powers and roots of complex numbers
26.1 Introduction
A complex number is of the form (a +jb) where a is
a real number and jb is an imaginary number. Hence
(1+j2) and (5−j7) are examples of complex numbers.
By deﬁnition, j = √−1 and j 2 = −1
Complex numbers are widely used in the analysis of
series, parallel and series–parallel electrical networks
supplied by alternating voltages (see Chapters 27
to 29), in deriving balance equations with a.c.
bridges (see Chapter 30), in analysing a.c. cir-
cuits using Kirchhoff’s laws (Chapter 33), mesh
and nodal analysis (Chapter 34), the superposition
theorem (Chapter 35), with Thévenin’s and Nor-
ton’s theorems (Chapter 36) and with delta–star
and star–delta transforms (Chapter 37) and in many
other aspects of higher electrical engineering. The
advantage of the use of complex numbers is that
the manipulative processes become simply algebraic
processes.

Figure 26.1 The Argand diagram
A complex number can be represented pictorially
on an Argand∗diagram. In Figure 26.1, the line 0A
represents the complex number (2+j3), 0B represents
(3−j), 0C represents (−2+j2) and 0D represents
(−4−j3)
A complex number of the form a + jb is called a
Cartesian or rectangular complex number(Cartesian
being named after Descartes∗). The signiﬁcance of the
j operator is shown in Figure 26.2. In Figure 26.2(a)
the number 4 (i.e. 4+j0) is shown drawn as a phasor
∗Who was Argand? Jean-Robert Argand (July 18 1768–
August 13 1822) was a highly inﬂuential mathematician who
published the ﬁrst complete proof of the fundamental theorem
of algebra To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
horizontally to the right of the origin on the real axis.
(Such a phasor could represent, for example, an alternat-
ing current, i =4sinωt amperes, when time t is zero.)
Thenumberj4(i.e.0+j4)isshowninFigure26.2(b)
drawn vertically upwards from the origin on the imag-
inary axis. Hence multiplying the number 4 by the
operator j results in an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90◦
without altering its magnitude.
Multiplying j4 by j gives j 24, i.e. −4, and is
shown in Figure 26.2(c) as a phasor four units long
on the horizontal real axis to the left of the origin –
an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90◦compared with the
position shown in Figure 26.2(b). Thus multiplying by
j2 reverses the original direction of a phasor.
Multiplying j 24 by j gives j 34, i.e. −j4, and is
shown in Figure 26.2(d) as a phasor four units long on
the vertical, imaginary axis downward from the origin –
an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90◦compared with the
position shown in Figure 26.2(c).
Multiplying j 34 by j gives j 44, i.e. 4, which is the
original position of the phasor shown in Figure 26.2(a).
Summarizing, application of the operator j to any
number rotates it 90◦anticlockwise on the Argand
∗Who was Descartes? René Descartes (31 March 1596–11
February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician and
writer. He wrote many inﬂuential texts including Meditations on
First Philosophy. Descartes is best known for the philosophical
statement ‘Cogito ergo sum’ (I think, therefore I am), found in
part IV of Discourse on the Method. To ﬁnd out more go to

diagram, multiplying a number by j 2 rotates it 180◦
anticlockwise, multiplying a number by j 3 rotates it
270◦anticlockwise and multiplication by j 4 rotates it
360◦anticlockwise, i.e. back to its original position. In
each case the phasor is unchanged in its magnitude.
By similar reasoning, if a phasor is operated on by −j
then a phase shift of −90◦(i.e. clockwise direction)
occurs, again without change of magnitude.
In electrical circuits, 90◦phase shifts occur between
voltage and current with pure capacitors and inductors;
this is the key to why j notation is used so much in
the analysis of electrical networks. This is explained in
Chapter 27.
26.2 Operations involving Cartesian
complex numbers
(a)
Addition and subtraction
(a + jb)+(c+ jd) = (a +c)+ j(b+d)
and
(a + jb)−(c+ jd) = (a −c)+ j(b−d)
Thus, (3+ j2)+(2−j4) = 3+ j2+2−j4=5 −j2
and
(3+ j2)−(2−j4) = 3+ j2−2+ j4=1 + j6
(b)
Multiplication
(a + jb)(c + jd) = ac + a(jd) + (jb)c+(jb)(jd)
= ac + jad + jbc + j2bd
But j2 =−1, thus
(a + jb)(c + jd) = (ac −bd) + j(ad + bc)
For example,
(3 + j2)(2−j4) = 6 −j12+ j4 −j 28
= (6 −(−1)8) + j(−12 + 4)
= 14 + j(−8) = 14 −j8
(c)
Complex conjugate
The complex conjugate of (a +jb) is (a −jb). For
example, the conjugate of (3−j2) is (3+j2)
The product of a complex number and its complex
conjugate is always a real number, and this is an impor-
tant property used when dividing complex numbers.
Thus
(a + jb)(a −jb) = a2 −jab+ jab −j 2b2
= a2 −(−b2)
= a2 + b2 (i.e. a real number)

Part 4
416
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
For example,
(1 + j2)(1 −j2) = 12 + 22 = 5
and
(3 −j4)(3 + j4) = 32 + 42 = 25
(d)
Division
The expression of one complex number divided by
another, in the form a +jb, is accomplished by multi-
plying the numerator and denominator by the complex
conjugate of the denominator. This has the effect of
making the denominator a real number. Hence, for
example,
2 + j4
3 −j4 = 2 + j4
3 −j4 × 3 + j4
3 + j4 = 6 + j8 + j12+ j 216
32 + 42
= 6 + j8 + j12−16
25
= −10 + j20
25
= −10
25 + j20
25 or
−0.4 + j0.8
The elimination of the imaginary part of the denomin-
ator by multiplying both the numeratoranddenominator
by the conjugate of the denominator is often termed
‘rationalizing’.
Problem 1.
In an electrical circuit the total
impedance ZT is given by
ZT =
Z1Z2
Z1 + Z2
+ Z3
Determine ZT in (a +jb) form, correct to two
decimal places, when Z1 = 5−j3, Z2 = 4+j7 and
Z3 = 3.9−j6.7
Z1Z2 = (5 −j3)(4+ j7) = 20 + j35 −j12−j 221
= 20 + j35 −j12+ 21 = 41 + j23
Z1 + Z2 = (5 −j3) + (4+ j7) = 9 + j4
Hence
Z1Z2
Z1 + Z2
= 41 + j23
9 + j4
= (41 + j23)(9 −j4)
(9 + j4)(9 −j4)
= 369 −j164+ j207 −j 292
92 + 42
= 369 −j164+ j207 + 92

= 461 + j43

= 4.753 + j0.443

If two complex numbers are equal, then their real parts
are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Hence, if
a +jb=c+jd thena =c andb=d.Thisisausefulprop-
erty, since equations having two unknown quantities can
be solved from one equation. Complex equations are
used when deriving balance equations with a.c. bridges
(see Chapter 30).

(a)
3(a +jb)=9−j2
(b)
(2+j)(−2+j)=x +jy
(c)
(a −j2b)+(b−j3a)=5+j2
(a)
3(a +jb)=9−j2. Thus 3a +j3b=9−j2
Equating real parts gives: 3a =9, i.e. a=3
Equating imaginary parts gives:
3b=−2, i.e. b= −2/3
(b)
(2+j)(−2+j)=x +jy
Thus
−4 + j2 −j2 + j 2 = x + jy
−5 + j0 = x + jy
Equating real and imaginary parts gives: x = −5,
y=0
(c)
(a −j2b)+(b−j3a)=5+j2
Thus (a +b)+j(−2b−3a)=5+j2
Hence
a + b = 5

and
−2b −3a = 2

26.4 The polar form of a complex
number
In Figure 26.3(a), Z =x +jy =r cosθ +jr sinθ
from trigonometry,
=r(cosθ +j sinθ)
Figure 26.3
This latter form is usually abbreviated to Z=r∠∠∠θ, and
is called the polar form of a complex number.
r is called the modulus (or magnitude of Z) and
is written as mod Z or |Z|. r is determined from
Pythagoras’ theorem on triangle OAZ, i.e.
|Z| = r = √(x2 + y2)
ThemodulusisrepresentedontheArganddiagramby
the distance OZ. θ is called the argument (or amplitude)
of Z and is written as arg Z. θ is also deduced from
triangle OAZ: arg Z = θ = tan−1y/x.
For example, the Cartesian complex number (3+j4)
is equal to r∠θ in polar form, where r=

(32 +42)=5
and θ =tan−1 4
3 =53.13◦
Hence (3+j4)=5∠∠∠53.13◦
Similarly, (−3+j4) is shown in Figure 26.3(b),
where r =

(32 +42)=5, θ′ = tan−1 4
3 =53.13◦
and
θ =180◦−53.13◦=126.87◦
Hence (−3+j4)=5∠∠∠126.87◦

Problem 5.
Convert 5∠−132◦into a +jb form
correct to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Figure 26.4 indicates that the polar complex number
5∠−132◦lies in the third quadrant of the Argand
diagram.
Figure 26.4
Using trigonometrical ratios,
x = 5cos48◦= 3.346 and y = 5sin48◦= 3.716
Hence 5∠∠∠−132◦= −3.346−j3.716
Alternatively,
5∠−132◦= 5(cos−132◦+ j sin−132◦)
= 5cos(−132◦) + j5sin(−132◦)
= −3.346−j3.716, as above
With this latter method the real and imaginary parts are
obtained directly, using a calculator.

network are given by Z1=4.7∠35◦and
Z2 =7.3∠−48◦. Determine in polar form the total

Z1 = 4.7∠35◦= 4.7cos35◦+ j4.7sin35◦
= 3.85 + j2.70
Z2 = 7.3∠−48◦= 7.3cos(−48◦) + j7.3sin(−48◦)
= 4.88 −j5.42
Z1 + Z2 = (3.85 + j2.70) + (4.88 −j5.42)

26.6 De Moivre’s theorem* – powers

∗Who was De Moivre? Abraham de Moivre (26 May 1667–
27 November 1754) was a French mathematician famous for de
Moivre’s formula, which links complex numbers and trigonom-
etry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability
theory. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

Part 4

This result is true for all positive, negative or fractional
values of n. De Moivre’s theorem is thus useful in
determining powers and roots of complex numbers. For
example,
[2∠15◦]6 = 26∠(6 × 15◦) = 64∠∠∠90◦= 0 + j64
A square root of a complex number is determined as
follows:
√[r∠θ] = [r∠θ]1/2 = r1/2∠1
2θ
However,it is importantto realize that a real numberhas
two square roots, equal in size but opposite in sign. On
an Argand diagram the roots are 180◦apart (see worked
Problem 8 following).
Problem 7.
Determine (−2+j3)5 in polar and in
Cartesian form.
Z =−2+j3 is situated in the second quadrant of the
Argand diagram.
Thus r =√[(2)2 +(3)2]=√13 and α =tan−13/2
=56.31◦
Hence the argument θ =180◦−56.31◦=123.69◦
Thus −2+j3 in polar form is √13∠123.69◦
(−2 + j3)5 = [√13∠123.69◦]5
= (√13)5∠(5 × 123.69◦)
from De Moivre’s theorem
= 135/2∠618.45◦
= 135/2∠258.45◦
(since 618.45◦≡618.45◦−360◦)
= 135/2∠−101.55◦= 609.3∠∠∠−101.55◦
In Cartesian form,
609.3∠−101.55◦= 609.3cos(−101.55◦)
+ j609.3sin(−101.55◦)
= −122 −j597
Problem 8.
Determine the two square roots of the
complex number (12+j5) in Cartesian and polar
form, correct to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Show the
roots on an Argand diagram.
In polar form 12+j5= √(122 +52)∠tan−1(5/12),
since 12+j5 is in the ﬁrst quadrant of the Argand
diagram, i.e. 12+j5=13∠22.62◦
Since we are ﬁnding the square roots of 13∠22.62 ◦
there will be two solutions. To obtain the second
solution it is helpful to express 13∠22.62◦also as
13∠(360◦+22.62◦), i.e. 13∠382.62◦(we have merely
rotated one revolution to obtain this result). The reason
for doing this is that when we divide the angles by 2 we
still obtain angles less than 360◦, as shown below.
Hence √(12 + j5) =√[13∠22.62◦]or√[13∠382.62◦]
=[13∠22.62◦]1/2or[13∠382.62◦]1/2

3.61∠−168.69◦is in the third quadrant of the Argand

Thus 3.61∠−168.69◦=3.61[cos(−168.69◦)
+ j sin(−168.69◦)]
=−3.540−j0.708
Thus in Cartesian form the two roots are
±(3.540+ j 0.708)

180◦apart, i.e. they lie on a straight line. This is always
true when ﬁnding square roots of complex numbers.

Chapter 27
Application of complex
numbers to series a.c. circuits
Why it is important to understand: Application of complex numbers to series a.c. circuits
Complex numbers are useful for a.c. circuit analysis because they provide a convenient method of symbol-
ically denoting phase shift between a.c. quantities like voltage and current. When analysing alternating
current circuits, it is found that quantities of voltage, current and even resistance (called impedance in
a.c. circuits) are not the familiar one-dimensional quantities used in d.c. circuits. Rather, these quantities,
because they’re dynamic, i.e. they are alternating in direction and amplitude, possess other dimensions
that must be taken into account. Frequency and phase shift are two of these dimensions. Even with rel-
atively simple a.c. circuits, dealing with a single frequency, there is still phase shift to contend with in
addition to the amplitude. A complex number is a single mathematical quantity able to express these two
dimensions of amplitude and phase shift at once. Oscillating currents and voltages are complex values
that have a real part we can measure and an imaginary part which we cannot. At ﬁrst it seems pointless to
create something we can’t see or measure, but it is actually useful in a number of ways. Firstly, it helps us
understand the behaviour of circuits which contain reactance, produced by capacitors or inductors, when
we apply a.c. signals and, secondly, it gives us a new way to think about oscillations. This is useful when
we want to apply concepts like the conservation of energy to understanding the behaviour of systems
which range from simple mechanical pendulums to a quartz-crystal oscillator. Knowledge of complex
numbers makes the analysis of a.c. series circuits straightforward.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
appreciate the use of complex numbers in a.c. circuits
•
perform calculations on series a.c. circuits using complex numbers
27.1 Introduction
Simple a.c. circuits may be analysed by using phasor
diagrams. However, when circuits become more com-
plicated analysis is considerably simpliﬁed by using
complexnumbers.Itisessentialthatthebasicoperations
used with complex numbers, as outlined in Chap-
ter 26, are thoroughly understood before proceeding
with a.c. circuit analysis. The theory introduced in
Chapter 17 is relevant; in this chapter similar cir-
cuits will be analysed using j notation and Argand
diagrams.

L in series (see Figure 27.4(a)), the applied voltage
V is the phasor sum of VR and VL as shown in the
phasor diagram of Figure 27.4(b). The current I lags
the applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0 ◦
and 90◦– the actual value depending on the values of
VR and VL, which depend on the values of R and L.
The circuit phase angle, i.e. the angle between the cur-
rent and the applied voltage, is shown as angle φ in
the phasor diagram. In any series circuit the current is
common to all components and is thus taken as the ref-
erence phasor in Figure 27.4(b). The phasor diagram
may be superimposed on the Argand diagram as shown
in Figure 27.4(c), where it may be seen that in complex
form the supply voltage V is given by:
V = VR + jVL
Figure 27.5(a) shows the voltage triangle that is derived
from the phasor diagram of Figure 27.4(b) (i.e. tri-
angle Oab). If each side of the voltage triangle is
divided by current I then the impedance triangle of
Figure 27.5(b) is derived. The impedance triangle may
be superimposed on the Argand diagram, as shown in

Thus, for example, an impedance expressed as
(3+j4) means that the resistance is 3 and the
inductive reactance is 4.
In polar form, Z =|Z|∠φ where, from the impedance
triangle, the modulus of impedance |Z|= √(R2 +X2

and the circuit phase angle φ = tan−1(XL/R) lagging.
(e)
R–C series circuit
In an a.c. circuit containing resistance R and capaci-
tance C in series (see Figure 27.6(a)),the applied voltage
V is the phasor sum of VR and VC, as shown in the
phasor diagram of Figure 27.6(b). The current I leads
the applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0 ◦
and 90◦– the actual value depending on the values of
VR and VC, which depend on the values of R and C.
The circuit phase angle is shown as angle φ in the phasor
diagram. The phasor diagram may be superimposed on
the Argand diagram as shown in Figure 27.6(c), where
it may be seen that in complex form the supply voltage
V is given by:
V = VR −jVC
Figure 27.7(a) shows the voltage triangle that is
derived from the phasor diagram of Figure 27.6(b).
If each side of the voltage triangle is divided by cur-
rent I, the impedance triangle is derived as shown

form the impedance Z is given by
Z = R−jXC
Thus, for example, an impedance expressed as
(9−j14) means that the resistance is 9 and the
capacitive reactance XC is 14
In polar form, Z =|Z|∠φ where, from the impedance
triangle,
|Z|=√(R2 + X2

and
φ = tan−1(XC/R)

R–L–C series circuit
In an a.c. circuit containing resistance R, inductance L
and capacitance C in series (see Figure 27.8(a)), the
applied voltage V is the phasor sum of VR,VL and VC,
as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 27.8(b)(where
the condition VL >VC is shown). The phasor diagram
may be superimposed on the Argand diagram as shown
in Figure 27.8(c), where it may be seen that in complex
form the supply voltage V is given by:
V = VR + j(VL −VC)
From the voltage triangle the impedance triangle is
derived and superimposing this on the Argand diagram
gives, in complex form,
impedance Z = R + j(XL −XC) or Z =|Z| ∠∠∠φ

General series circuit
In an a.c. circuit containing several impedances con-
nected in series, say, Z1,Z2,Z3,...,Zn, then the total
equivalent impedance ZT is given by
ZT = Z1 + Z2 + Z3 +···+ Zn
Problem 1.
Determine the values of the
resistance and the series-connected inductance or
capacitance for each of the following impedances:
(a) (12+j5), (b) −j40, (c) 30∠60◦,
(d) 2.20 × 106∠−30◦. Assume for each a
frequency of 50Hz.
(a)
From Section 27.2(d), for an R–L series circuit,
impedance Z =R +jXL
Thus Z =(12+j5) represents a resistance of
12 and an inductive reactance of 5 in
series.
Since inductive reactance XL =2πf L
inductance L = XL
2πf =
5
2π(50) = 0.0159H
i.e. the inductance is 15.9mH
Thus an impedance (12 + j5) represents a
resistance of 12 in series with an inductance
of 15.9mH
(b)
From Section 27.2(c), for a purely capacitive
circuit, impedance Z =−jXC
Thus Z =−j40 represents zero resistance and a
capacitive reactance of 40.
Since capacitive reactance XC =1/(2πf C)
capacitance C =
1
2πf XC
=
1
2π(50)(40) F
=
106
2π(50)(40) μF = 79.6μF
Thus an impedance −j40 represents a pure
capacitor of capacitance 79.6μF
(c)
30∠60◦=30(cos60◦+j sin60◦)=15+j25.98
Thus Z =30∠60◦=(15+j25.98) represents
a resistance of 15 and an inductive reactance of
25.98 in series (from Section 27.2(d)).
Since XL =2πf L
inductance L = XL
2πf = 25.98
2π(50)
= 0.0827 H or 82.7mH
Thus an impedance 30∠∠∠60◦ represents a
resistance of 15 in series with an inductance
of 82.7mH
(d)
2.20×106∠−30◦
=2.20 × 106[cos(−30◦)+j sin(−30◦)]
=1.905 × 106−j1.10 × 106
Thus Z =2.20×106∠−30◦
=(1.905×106−j1.10×106)

Part 4

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
represents a resistance of 1.905×106 (i.e.
1.905M)
and
a
capacitive
reactance
of
1.10×106  in series (from Section 27.2(e)).
Since capacitive reactance XC =1/(2πf C),
capacitance C =
1
2πf XC
=
1
2π(50)(1.10× 106) F
= 2.894× 10−9F or 2.894nF
Thus an impedance 2.2 × 106∠∠∠−30 ◦ repre-
sents a resistance of 1.905M in series with a
2.894nF capacitor.
Problem 2.
Determine, in polar and rectangular
forms, the current ﬂowing in an inductor of
negligible resistance and inductance 159.2mH
when it is connected to a 250V, 50Hz supply.
Inductive reactance
XL =2πf L=2π(50)(159.2×10−3)= 50
Thus circuit impedance Z =(0+j50)=50∠90◦
Supply voltage, V =250∠0◦V (or (250+j0)V)
(Note that since the voltage is given as 250V, this is
assumed to mean 250∠0◦V or (250+j0)V)
Hence current I = V
Z = 250∠0◦
50∠90◦= 250
50 ∠(0◦−90◦)
= 5∠∠∠−90◦A
Alternatively, I = V
Z = (250 + j0)
(0 + j50) = 250(−j50)
j50(−j50)
= −j(50)(250)
502
= −j5A
which is the same as 5∠−90◦A
Problem 3.
A 3μF capacitor is connected to a
supply of frequency 1kHz and a current of
2.83∠90◦A ﬂows. Determine the value of the
supply p.d.
Capacitive reactance XC =
1
2πf C
=
1
2π(1000)(3 × 10−6)
= 53.05
Hence circuit impedance
Z = (0−j53.05) = 53.05∠−90◦
Current I = 2.83∠90◦A (or (0+j2.83)A)
Supply p.d., V = IZ =(2.83∠90◦)(53.05∠−90◦)
i.e.
p.d. = 150∠∠∠0◦V
Alternatively, V =IZ = (0+j2.83)(0−j53.05)
= −j2(2.83)(53.05) =150V
Problem 4.
The impedance of an electrical circuit
is (30−j50)ohms. Determine (a) the resistance,
(b) the capacitance, (c) the modulus of the
impedance and (d) the current ﬂowing and its phase
angle, when the circuit is connected to a 240V,
50Hz supply.
(a)
Since impedance Z =(30−j50), the resis-
tance is 30ohms and the capacitive reactance is
50
(b)
Since XC =1/(2πf C), capacitance,
C =

2π(50)(50) = 63.66μF
(c)

=58.31
(d)
Impedance Z =(30−j50)

the 32 resistor and (d) the p.d. across the coil.
(a)
Inductive reactance XL = 2πf L = 2π(50)(0.15)

(b)
Current I = V
Z =
200∠0◦
57.0∠55.81◦

i.e. the current is 3.51A lagging the voltage by
55.81◦
(c)
P.d. across the 32 resistor,
VR =IR =(3.51∠−55.81◦)(32∠0◦)
i.e. VR = 112.3∠∠∠−55.81◦V
(d)
P.d. across the coil,
VL =IXL =(3.51∠−55.81◦)(47.1∠90◦)
i.e. VL = 165.3∠∠∠34.19◦V
The phasor sum of VR and VL is the supply voltage V
as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 27.10.
VR = 112.3∠−55.81◦= (63.11 −j92.89)V
VL = 165.3∠34.19◦V = (136.73 + j92.89)V
Hence
V = VR + VL = (63.11 −j92.89) + (136.73 + j92.89)
= (200 + j0)V or 200∠0◦V, correct to three
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Problem 6.
Determine the value of impedance if
a current of (7+j16)A ﬂows in a circuit when the
supply voltage is (120+j200)V. If the frequency of
the supply is 5MHz, determine the value of the

Impedance Z = V
I = (120 + j200)
(7 + j16)
= 233.24∠59.04◦
17.464∠66.37◦
= 13.36∠−7.33 or (13.25−j1.705)
The series circuit thus consists of a 13.25 resistor and
a capacitor of capacitive reactance 1.705
Since XC =

Application of complex

networks
Why it is important to understand: Application of complex numbers to parallel a.c. circuits
As with series circuits, parallel networks may be analysed by using phasor diagrams. However, with
parallel networks containing more than two branches, this can become very complicated. It is with parallel
a.c. network analysis in particular that the full beneﬁt of using complex numbers may be appreciated.
Parallel a.c. circuits are like parallel d.c. circuits, except that phasors need to be used throughout the
analysis. Also, the same rules that are needed in analysing parallel d.c. circuits, such as Kirchhoff’s
current law and the current division rule, are also needed for parallel a.c. networks. Before analysing
such networks, admittance, conductance and susceptance are deﬁned. Knowledge of complex numbers
makes the analysis of a.c. parallel networks straightforward.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
determine admittance, conductance and susceptance in a.c. circuits
•
perform calculations on parallel a.c. circuits using complex numbers
28.1 Introduction
As with series circuits, parallel networks may be
analysed by using phasor diagrams. However, with
parallel networks containing more than two branches
this can become very complicated. It is with parallel
a.c. network analysis in particular that the full beneﬁt of
using complex numbers may be appreciated. The theory
for parallel a.c. networks introduced in Chapter 18 is
relevant; more advanced networks will be analysed in
this chapter using j notation. Before analysing such
networks admittance, conductance and susceptance are
deﬁned.

28.2 Admittance, conductance
and susceptance
Admittance is deﬁned as the current I ﬂowing in an
a.c. circuit divided by the supply voltage V (i.e. it is the
reciprocal of impedance Z). The symbol for admittance
is Y. Thus
Y = I
V = 1
Z
The unit of admittance is the siemen,∗S.
An impedance may be resolved into a real part R
and an imaginary part X, giving Z =R ± jX. Similarly,
an admittance may be resolved into two parts – the real
part being called the conductance G, and the imaginary
part being called the susceptance B – and expressed in
complex form. Thus admittance
Y =G± jB
When an a.c. circuit contains:
(a)
pure resistance, then
Z = R and Y = 1
Z = 1
R = G
(b)
pure inductance, then
Z = jXL and Y = 1
Z =

jXL
=
−j
( jXL)(−j)

thus a negative sign is associated with inductive

(c)

Z = −jXC and Y = 1
Z =

−jXC

(−jXC)(j)

The conclusions that may be drawn from Sections
(d) to (g) above are:
(i) that a series circuit is more easily represented
by an impedance,
(ii) that a parallel circuit is often more eas-
ily represented by an admittance especially
when more than two parallel impedances are
involved.
Problem 1.
Determine the admittance,
conductance and susceptance of the following
impedances: (a) −j5, (b) (25+j40),

Since there is no real part, conductance, G=0,

Thus conductance, G=0.0112S and inductive

Thus conductance, G=0.231S and capacitive

(d)
If impedance Z = 50∠40◦, then
admittance Y = 1
Z =

50∠40◦= 1∠0◦
50∠40◦

50∠−40◦=0.02∠∠∠−40◦S or
(0.0153−j0.0129)S
Thus conductance, G=0.0153S and inductive
susceptance, BL =0.0129S.
Problem 2.
Determine expressions for
the impedance of the following admittances:
(a) 0.004∠30◦S,
(b) (0.001−j0.002)S,
(c) (0.05+ j 0.08)S.
(a)
Since admittance Y =1/Z, impedance Z =1/Y
Hence impedance Z =

(c)
Admittance Y =(0.05+j0.08)S

Hence impedance Z =

0.0094∠57.99◦
=10.64∠∠∠−57.99◦ or
(5.64−j9.02)
Problem 3.

(0.040+j0.025)S. Determine the values of the
resistance and the capacitive reactance of the circuit
if they are connected (a) in parallel, (b) in series.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(a) Parallel connection
Admittance Y =(0.040+ j0.025)S, therefore con-
ductance, G=0.040S and capacitive susceptance,
BC = 0.025S.From equation (1) when a circuit consists
of resistance R and capacitive reactance in parallel, then
Y =(1/R)+(j/XC).
Hence resistance R = 1
G =

0.040 =25
and capacitive reactance XC = 1
BC

0.025 =40
The circuit and phasor diagrams are shown in
Figure 28.1.
(b) Series connection
Admittance Y = (0.040+j0.025) S, therefore
impedance Z = 1
Y =

0.040+j0.025
=
0.040−j0.025
(0.040)2+(0.025)2

Thus the resistance, R=17.98 and capacitive
reactance, XC =11.24
The circuit and phasor diagrams are shown in
Figure 28.2.
The circuits shown in Figures 28.1(a) and 28.2(a) are

Chapter 29
Power in a.c. circuits
Why it is important to understand: Power in a.c. circuits
Power in an electric circuit is the rate of ﬂow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating
current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductance and capacitance may result in periodic
reversals of the direction of energy ﬂow. The portion of power averaged over a complete cycle of the
a.c. waveform results in net transfer of energy in one direction, and is known as real power. The portion
of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as reactive power.
Renewable energy sources are used mainly to generate a.c. electrical power, which is injected into power
networks consisting of a large number of transmission lines, conventional generators and consumers. Such
power networks, especially in developed countries, are of considerable complexity. To determine the way
these injected powers ﬂow from generators to consumers requires complex calculations based on network
analysis. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of active, reactive and apparent power. These are
the basic tools needed to understand and calculate ﬂows of energy from generators to consumers. In all
a.c. power systems, excluding very low capacity ones, power is generated and transported in three-phase
form. Power factor can be an important aspect to consider in an a.c. circuit, because any power factor
less than 1 means that the circuit’s wiring has to carry more current than would be necessary with zero
reactance in the circuit to deliver the same amount of true power to the resistive load. Calculation of
power in a.c. circuits, together with the advantages of power factor improvement, are considered in this
chapter.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
determine active, apparent and reactive power in a.c. series/parallel networks
•
appreciate the need for power factor improvement
•
perform calculations involving power factor improvement
29.1 Introduction
Alternating currents and voltages change their polar-
ity during each cycle. It is not surprising therefore to
ﬁnd that power also pulsates with time. The product
of voltage v and current i at any instant of time is
calledinstantaneous power p, and is given by:
p=vi
The unit of power is the watt∗

29.2 Determination of power in a.c.
circuits
(a)
Purely resistive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a circuit
comprising resistance only. The resulting current is
i =Im sinωt, and the corresponding instantaneous
power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)(Im sinωt)
i.e.
p = VmIm sin2 ωt
From trigonometrical double angle formulae,
cos2A = 1 −2sin2A, from which,
sin2 A = 1
2(1 −cos2A)
Thus sin2ωt = 1
2(1 −cos2ωt)
Then power p = VmIm
# 1
2(1−cos2ωt)
$
i.e.
p= 1
2VmIm(1−cos2ωt)
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 29.1.
The waveform of power repeats itself after π/ω seconds
and hence the power has a frequency twice that of volt-
age and current. The power is always positive, having
a maximum value of VmIm. The average or mean value
of the power is 1
2VmIm
The r.m.s. value of voltage V = 0.707Vm, i.e.
V =Vm/√2, from which, Vm =√2V . Similarly, the
r.m.s. value of current, I =Im/√2, from which,
Im =√2I. Hence the average power, P, developed in a
purely resistive a.c. circuit is given by
P = 1
2VmIm = 1
2(√2V )(√2I)=VI watts
Figure 29.1 The waveforms of v,i and p
Also, power P =I 2R or V 2/R as for a d.c. circuit, since
V =IR.
Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
resistive a.c. circuit is given by
P=VI=I2R= V 2
R watts
where V and I are r.m.s. values.
(b)
Purely inductive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a circuit con-
taining pure inductance (theoretical case). The result-
ing current is i = Im sin(ωt −(π/2)) since current lags
voltage by 90◦in a purely inductive circuit, and the
corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)Im sin(ωt −(π/2))
i.e. p = VmIm sinωt sin(ωt −(π/2))
However, sin(ωt −(π/2))=−cosωt
Thus p = −VmIm sinωt cosωt
Rearranging
gives:
p=−1
2VmIm
(2sinωt cosωt).
However, from the double angle formulae,
2sinωt cosωt =sin2ωt
Thus power, p=−1
2 VmIm sin2ωt
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 29.2.
The frequency of power is twice that of voltage and
current. For the power curve shown in Figure 29.2, the
area above the horizontal axis is equal to the area below,
thus over a complete cycle the average power P is zero.
Figure 29.2 Power in a purely inductive a.c. circuit

Part 4
448
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
It is noted that when v and i are both positive, power p
is positive and energy is delivered from the source to the
inductance; when v and i have opposite signs, power p
is negative and energy is returned from the inductance
to the source.
In general, when the current through an inductance is
increasing, energy is transferred from the circuit to the
magnetic ﬁeld, but this energy is returned when the
current is decreasing.
Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
inductive a.c. circuit is zero.
(c)
Purely capacitive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a circuit
containing pure capacitance. The resulting current is
i =Im sin(ωt +(π/2)), since current leads voltage by
90◦in a purely capacitive circuit, and the corresponding
instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p=vi =(Vm sinωt)Im sin(ωt +(π/2))
i.e. p=VmIm sinωt sin(ωt +(π/2))
However, sin(ωt +(π/2))= cosωt
Thus P =VmIm sinωt cosωt
Rearranging gives p= 1
2VmIm(2sinωt cosωt)
Thus power, p= 1
2VmIm sin 2ωt
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 29.3.
Over a complete cycle the average power P is zero.
When the voltage across a capacitor is increasing,
energy is transferred from the circuit to the electric

ﬁeld, but this energy is returned when the voltage is
decreasing.
Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
capacitive a.c. circuit is zero.
(d)
R –L or R –C a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a cir-
cuit containing resistance and inductance or resis-
tance and capacitance. Let the resulting current be
i =Im sin(ωt +φ), where phase angle φ will be posi-
tive for an R–C circuit and negative for an R–L circuit.
The corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p=vi =(Vm sinωt)(Im sin(ωt +φ))
i.e. p=VmIm sinωt sin(ωt +φ)
Products of sine functions may be changed into differ-
ences of cosine functions by using:
sinA sinB = −1
2[cos(A+B)−cos(A−B)]
Substituting ωt =A and (ωt +φ)=B gives:
power, p=VmIm

−1
2[cos(ωt +ωt +φ)
−cos(ωt −(ωt +φ))]
&
i.e.
p= 1
2VmIm[cos(−φ)−cos(2ωt +φ)]
However, cos(−φ)= cosφ
Thus p= 1
2VmIm[cosφ −cos(2ωt +φ)]
The instantaneous power p thus consists of
(i)
a sinusoidal term, −1
2VmIm cos(2ωt +φ), which
has a mean value over a cycle of zero, and
(ii)
a constant term, 1
2VmIm cos φ (since φ is constant
for a particular circuit).
Thus the average value of power, P = 1
2VmIm cos φ
Since Vm =√2V and Im =√2I
average power, P = 1
2(√2V )(√2I) cos φ
i.e.
P=VI cos φ watts
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 29.4
for an R–L circuit. The waveform of power is seen to
pulsate at twice the supply frequency. The areas of the
power curve (shown shaded) above the horizontal time
axis represent power supplied to the load; the small
areas below the axis represent power being returned to
the supply from the inductance as the magnetic ﬁeld
collapses.

Part 4

Figure 29.4 Power in a.c. circuit containing resistance and
inductive reactance
A similar shape of power curve is obtained for an
R–C circuit, the small areas below the horizontal axis
representing power being returned to the supply from
the charged capacitor. The difference between the areas
above and below the horizontal axis represents the heat
loss due to the circuit resistance. Since power is dissi-
pated only in a pure resistance, the alternative equations
for power, P =I 2
RR, may be used, where IR is the r.m.s.
current ﬂowing through the resistance.
Summarizing, the average power P in a circuit con-
taining resistance and inductance and/or capaci-
tance, whether in series or in parallel, is given by
P=VI cosφ or P=I2
R R (V, I and IR being r.m.s.
values).
29.3 Power triangle and power factor
A phasordiagram in which the currentI lags the applied
voltage V by angle φ (i.e. an inductive circuit) is shown
in Figure 29.5(a). The horizontal component of V is
V cosφ, and the vertical component of V is V sin φ. If
each of the voltage phasors of triangle 0ab is multiplied
by I, Figure 29.5(b) is produced and is known as the
‘power triangle’. Each side of the triangle represents
a particular type of power:
True or active power P = VI cosφ watts (W)
Apparent power S = VI voltamperes (VA)
Reactive power Q = VI sinφ vars (var)
The power triangle is not a phasor diagram since quan-
tities P, Q and S are mean values and not r.m.s. values
of sinusoidally varying quantities.
Figure 29.5 (a) Phasor diagram, (b) power triangle for induc-
tive circuit
Superimposing the power triangle on an Argand dia-
gram produces a relationship between P, S and Q in
complex form, i.e.
S=P+ jQ
Apparent power, S, is an important quantity since
a.c. apparatus, such as generators, transformers and
cables, is usually rated in voltamperes rather than in
watts. The allowable output of such apparatus is usually
limited not by mechanicalstress but by temperaturerise,
and hence by the losses in the device. The losses are
determined by the voltage and current and are almost
independent of the power factor. Thus the amount of
electrical equipment installed to supply a certain load
is essentially determined by the voltamperes of the load
rather than by the power alone.
The rating of a machine is deﬁned as the maximum
apparent power that it is designed to carry continuously
without overheating.
The reactive power, Q, contributes nothing to the net
energy transfer and yet it causes just as much loading
of the equipment as if it did so. Reactive power is a
term much used in power generation, distribution and
utilization of electrical energy.
Inductive reactive power, by convention,is deﬁned as
positive reactive power; capacitive reactive power, by
convention, is deﬁned as negative reactive power. The
above relationships derived from the phasor diagram
of an inductive circuit may be shown to be true for a
capacitive circuit, the power triangle being as shown in
Figure 29.6.

29.4 Use of complex numbers
for determination of power
Let a circuit be supplied by an alternating voltage V ∠α,
where
V ∠α = V (cosα + j sinα) = V cosα + jVsinα
= a + jb
(1)
Let the current ﬂowing in the circuit be I∠β, where
I∠β = I(cosβ + j sinβ) = I cosβ + jIsinβ
= c + jd
(2)
From Sections 29.2 and 29.3,powerP =VIcosφ, where
φ is the angle between the voltage V and current I. If
the voltage is V ∠α◦and the current is I∠β◦, then the
angle between voltage and current is (α −β)◦
Thus power, P =VIcos(α −β)
From compound angle formulae,
cos(α −β)= cosα cosβ + sinα sinβ
Hence power,
P =VI[cos α cos β +sin α sin β]
Rearranging gives
P =(V cos α)(I cos β)+(V sin α)(I sin β), i.e.
P =(a)(c)+(b)(d) from equations (1) and (2)
Summarizing, if V = (a + jb) and I = (c + jd), then
power, P = ac + bd
(3)
Thus power may be calculated fromthe sum of the prod-
ucts of the real components and imaginary components
of voltage and current.
Reactive power, Q=VI sin(α −β)
From compound angle formulae,
sin(α −β)=sin α cos β −cos α sin β
Thus Q=VI[sin α cos β −cos α sin β]
Rearranging gives
Q=(V sin α)(I cos β)−(V cos α)(I sin β), i.e.
Q=(b)(c)−(a)(d ) from equations (1) and (2)
Summarizing, if V =(a + jb) and I = (c+ jd), then
reactive power,
Q = bc−ad
(4)
Expressions (3) and (4) provide an alternative method
of determining true power P and reactive power Q
when the voltage and current are complex quantities.
From Section 29.3, apparent power S =P +jQ. How-
ever, merely multiplying V by I in complex form will
not give this result, i.e. (from above)
S = VI = (a + jb)(c + jd ) = (ac −bd ) + j(bc + ad )
Here the real part is not the expression for power as
given in equation (3) and the imaginary part is not the
expression of reactive power given in equation (4).
The correct expression may be derived by multiply-
ing the voltage V by the conjugate of the current, i.e.
(c−jd), denoted by I ∗. Thus
apparent power S=VI∗=(a +jb)(c−jd)
=(ac+bd)+j(bc−ad)
i.e.
S=P+ jQ from equations (3) and (4)
Thus the active and reactive powers may be deter-
mined if, and only if, the voltage V is multiplied by
the conjugate of current I. As stated in Section 29.3, a

reactance 12 is connected across a supply voltage
of 52∠30◦volts. Determine the active power in the
circuit.
The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 29.7.

Current I = V
Z =

There are three methods of calculating power.
Method 1.
Active power, P =VI cos φ, where φ
is the angle between voltage V and cur-
rent I. Hence
P =(52)(4) cos[30◦−(−37.38◦)]
=(52)(4) cos 67.38◦=80W
Method 2.
Active power,P =I 2
RR=(4)2(5)=80W
Method 3.
Since V =(45.03+j26.0)V and
I =(3.18−j2.43)A, then active
power,
P =(45.03)(3.18)+(26.0)(−2.43)
from equation (3)
i.e.
P =143.2−63.2=80W
Problem 2.
A current of (15+j8)A ﬂows in a
circuit whose supply voltage is (120+j200)V.
Determine (a) the active power and (b) the reactive
power.
(a)
Method1.Active power P =(120)(15)+(200)(8),
from equation (3), i.e.
P =1800+1600=3400W or 3.4kW
Method2.CurrentI =(15+j8)A=17∠28.07◦A
and
Voltage V =(120+j200)V=233.24∠59.04◦V
Angle between voltage and current
=59.04◦−28.07◦
=30.97◦
Hence power, P =VIcosφ
=(233.24)(17) cos 30.97◦
= 3.4kW
(b)
Method 1. Reactive power,
Q=(200)(15)−(120)(8)
from equation (4), i.e.
Q=3000−960=2040var or 2.04 kvar
Method 2. Reactive power,
Q=VIsinφ =(233.24)(17) sin 30.97◦

Alternatively,parts (a) and (b) could have been obtained
directly, using
Apparent power, S =VI ∗

A series circuit possesses resistance
R and capacitance C. The circuit dissipates a power

current ﬂowing and its phase, (b) the value of
resistance R and (c) the value of capacitance C.

Part 4
452
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
(a)
Since
v =141.4sin(104t +(π/9))
volts,
then
141.4V represents the maximum value, from
which the r.m.s. voltage, V =141.4/√2=100V,
and the phase angle of the voltage=+π/9 rad or
20◦leading. Hence as a phasor the voltage V is
written as 100∠∠∠20◦V
Power factor = 0.866 = cosφ, from which
φ = cos−1 0.866=30◦
Hence the angle between voltage and current
is 30◦
Power P = VIcosφ
Hence 1732 = (100)I cos30◦from which,
current, |I| =
1732
(100)(0.866) = 20A
Since the power factor is leading, the current pha-
sor leads the voltage – in this case by 30◦. Since
the voltage has a phase angle of 20◦,
current, I = 20∠(20◦+ 30◦)A = 20∠∠∠50◦A
(b)
Impedance
Z = V
I = 100∠20◦
20∠50◦
=5∠−30◦ or (4.33−j2.5)
Hence the resistance, R=4.33 and the capac-
itive reactance, XC =2.5.
Alternatively, the resistance may be deter-
mined from active power, P =I 2R. Hence
1732=(20)2R, from which,
resistance R = 1732
(20)2 = 4.33
(c)
Since v =141.4sin(104t +(π/9)) volts, angular

29.5 Power factor improvement
For a particular power supplied, a high power factor
reduces the current ﬂowing in a supply system, which
consequently lowers losses (i.e. I 2R losses) and hence
results in cheaper running costs (as stated in Section
18.7, page 289). Supply authorities use tariffs which
encourage consumers to operate at a reasonably high
power factor. One method of improvingthe power factor
of an inductive load is to connect a bank of capacitors
in parallel with the load. Capacitors are rated in reactive
voltamperes and the effect of the capacitors is to reduce
the reactive power of the system without changing the
active power. Most residential and industrial loads on a
powersystem are inductive,i.e. theyoperate at a lagging
power factor.
A simpliﬁed circuit diagram is shown in Figure
29.15(a) where a capacitor C is connected across an
inductive load. Before the capacitor is connected the
circuit current is ILR and is shown lagging voltage V
by angle φ1 in the phasor diagram of Figure 29.15(b).
When the capacitor C is connected it takes a current IC
which is shown in the phasor diagram leading voltage
V by 90◦. The supply current I in Figure 29.15(a) is
now the phasor sum of currents ILR and IC as shown in
Figure 29.15(b). The circuit phase angle, i.e. the angle

Figure 29.15 (a) Circuit diagram (b) phasor diagram
between V and I, has been reduced from φ1 to φ2 and
the power factor has been improved from cos φ 1 to
cos φ2
Figure 29.16(a) shows the power triangle for an
inductive circuit with a lagging power factor of cos φ 1.
In Figure 29.16(b), the angle φ1 has been reduced to
φ2, i.e. the power factor has been improved from cos φ 1
to cos φ2 by introducing leading reactive voltamperes
(shown as length ab) which is achieved by connect-
ing capacitance in parallel with the inductive load. The
power factor has been improved by reducing the reac-
tive voltamperes; the active power P has remained
unaffected.
Power factor correction results in the apparent power
S decreasing (from 0a to 0b in Figure 29.16(b)) and thus
the current decreasing, so that the power distribution
system is used more efﬁciently.
Another method of power factor improvement,
besides the use of static capacitors, is by using syn-
chronousmotors; such machines can be made to operate
at leading power factors.
Problem 6.

The power triangle is shown as triangle 0ab in
Figure 29.17. When the power factor is 0.90, the circuit
phase angle φ =cos−10.90=25.84◦. The capacitor rat-
ing needed to improve the power factor to 0.90 is given
by length bd in Figure 29.17.

Hence angle φ =cos−1 0.966=15◦

to change from 0cb (see Figure 29.19) to 0ab,

A.c. bridges
Why it is important to understand: A.c. bridges
A.c. bridges are used for measuring the values of inductors and capacitors or for converting the signals
measured from inductive or capacitive components into a suitable form such as a voltage. Inductors and
capacitors can also be measured using an approximate method of voltage division. These methods are
discussed in this chapter for a number of bridge circuits for which complex numbers are needed for the
determination of unknown component values. Impedance bridges work the same way as a Wheatstone
bridge, which measures resistance, only the balance equation is with complex quantities, as both magni-
tude and phase across the components of the two dividers must be equal in order for the null detector
to indicate zero. The null detector must be a device capable of detecting very small a.c. voltages. An
oscilloscope is often used for this, although very sensitive electromechanical meter movements and even
headphones (small speakers) may be used if the source frequency is within audio range.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
derive the balance equations of any a.c. bridge circuit
•
state types of a.c. bridge circuit
•
calculate unknown components when using an a.c. bridge circuit

A.c. bridges

30.1 Introduction
A.C. bridges are electrical networks, based upon an
extension of the Wheatstone∗bridge principle, used
for the determination of an unknown impedance by
comparison with known impedances and for the deter-
mination of frequency. In general, they contain four
impedance arms, an a.c. power supply and a balance
detector which is sensitive to alternating currents. It is
more difﬁcult to achieve balance in an a.c. bridgethan in
a d.c. bridge because both the magnitude and the phase
angle of impedances arerelatedtothebalancecondition.
Balance equations are derived by using complex num-
bers. A.c. bridges provide precise methods of mea-
surement of inductance and capacitance, as well as
resistance.
30.2 Balance conditions for an a.c.
bridge
The majority of well known a.c. bridges are classiﬁed as
four-arm bridges and consist of an arrangement of four
impedances (in complexform, Z =R ± jX), as shown in
Figure 30.1. As with the d.c. Wheatstone bridge circuit,
an a.c. bridge is said to be ‘balanced’ when the cur-
rent through the detector is zero (i.e. when no current

ﬂows between B and D of Figure 30.1). If the current
through the detector is zero, then the current I1 ﬂowing
in impedance Z1 must also ﬂow in impedance Z2. Also,
at balance, the currentI4 ﬂowing in impedanceZ4, must
also ﬂow through Z3
At balance:
(i)
the volt drop between A and B is equal to the volt
drop between A and D,
i.e.
VAB = VAD
i.e. I1Z1 = I4Z4 (both in magnitude and
in phase)
(1)
(ii)
the volt drop between B and C is equal to the volt
drop between D and C,
i.e.
VBC = VDC
i.e. I1Z2 = I4Z3 (both in magnitude and
in phase)
(2)
Dividing equation (1) by equation (2) gives
I1Z1
I1Z2
= I4Z4

from which Z1

or
Z1Z3 = Z2Z4

Equation (3) shows that at balance the products of the
impedances of opposite arms of the bridge are equal.
If
in
polar
form,
Z1=|Z1|∠α1,
Z2 =|Z2|∠α2,
Z3 =|Z3|∠α3, and Z4 =|Z4|∠α4, then from equa-
tion (3), (|Z1|∠α1)(|Z3|∠α3) = (|Z2|∠α2)(|Z4|∠α4),

bridge, i.e.
|Z1| |Z3| = |Z2||Z4|
and α1 + α3 = α2 + α4
When deriving balance equations of a.c. bridges, where
at least two of the impedances are in complex form, it

Part 4
462
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
is important to appreciate that for a complex equation
a +jb=c+jd the real parts are equal, i.e. a =c, and the
imaginary parts are equal, i.e. b=d
Usually one arm of an a.c. bridge circuit contains
the unknown impedance while the other arms contain
known ﬁxed or variable components. Normally only
two components of the bridge are variable. When bal-
ancing a bridge circuit, the current in the detector is
gradually reduced to zero by successive adjustments of
the two variable components. At balance, the unknown
impedance can be expressed in terms of the ﬁxed and
variable components.
Procedure for determining the balance
equations of any a.c. bridge circuit
(i)
Determine for the bridge circuit the impedance
in each arm in complex form and write down the
balance equation as in equation (3). Equations
are usually easier to manipulate if L and C are
initially expressed as XL and XC, rather than ωL
or 1/(ωC)
(ii)
Isolate the unknown terms on the left-hand side
of the equation in the form a +jb
(iii)
Manipulatethe terms on the right-handside of the
equation into the form c+jd
(iv)
Equate the real parts of the equation, i.e. a =c,
and equate the imaginary parts of the equation,
i.e. b=d
(v)
Substitute ωL for XL and 1/(ωC) for Xc where
appropriateandexpresstheﬁnalequationsintheir
simplest form.
Types of detector used with a.c. bridges vary with the
type of bridge and with the frequency at which it is
operated. Common detectors used include:
(i)
an oscilloscope, which is suitable for use with a
very wide range of frequencies;
(ii)
earphones (or telephone headsets),whichare suit-
able for frequencies up to about 10kHz and are
used often at about 1kHz, in which region the
human ear is very sensitive;

various electronic detectors, which use tuned cir-
cuitstodetectcurrentatthecorrectfrequency;and
(iv)
vibration galvanometers, which are usually used
for mains-operated bridges. This type of detec-
tor consists basically of a narrow moving coil
which is suspended on a ﬁne phosphor bronze
wire between the poles of a magnet. When a
current of the correct frequency ﬂows through
the coil, it is set into vibration. This is because
the mechanical resonant frequency of the sus-
pension is purposely made equal to the electrical
frequency of the coil current. A mirror attached
to the coil reﬂects a spot of light on to a scale, and
when the coil is vibrating the spot appears as an
extended beam of light. When the band reduces
to a spot the bridge is balanced. Vibration gal-
vanometers are available in the frequency range
10Hz to 300Hz.
30.3 Types of a.c. bridge circuit
A large number of bridge circuits have been developed,
each of which has some particular advantage under cer-
tain conditions. Some of the most important a.c. bridges
include the Maxwell, Hay, Owen and Maxwell-Wien
bridges for measuring inductance, the De Sauty and
Schering bridges for measuring capacitance, and the
Wien bridgefor measuringfrequency.Obviouslya large
number of combinations of components in bridges is
possible.
In many bridges it is found that two of the balancing
impedances will be of the same nature, and often consist
of standard non-inductive resistors.
For a bridge to balance quickly the requirement is
either:
(i)
the adjacent arms are both pure components (i.e.
either both resistors, or both pure capacitors, or
one of each) – this type of bridge being called a
ratio-arm bridge (see, for example, paras (a), (c),
(e) and (g) below); or
(ii)
a pair of opposite arms are pure components –
this type of bridge being called a product-arm
bridge (see, for example, paras (b), (d) and (f)
below).
A ratio-arm bridge can only be used to measure
reactive quantities of the same type. When using a
product-arm bridge the reactive component of the bal-
ancing impedance must be of opposite sign to the
unknown reactive component.
A commercial or universal bridge is available and
can be used to measure resistance, inductance or capa-
citance.

(a)
The simple Maxwell∗bridge
This bridge is used to measure the resistance and
inductance of a coil having a high Q-factor (where
Q-factor=ωL/R, see Chapters 17 and 31).
A coil having unknown resistance Rx and inductance
Lx is shown in the circuit diagram of a simple Maxwell
bridge in Figure 30.2. R4 and L4 represent a standard
coil having known variable values. At balance, expres-
sions for Rx and Lx may be derived in terms of known
components R2, R3, R4 and L4
Figure 30.2 Simple Maxwell bridge
The procedure for determining the balance equations
given in Section 30.2 may be followed.
(i)
From Figure 30.2, Zx =Rx +jXLx, Z2=R2,
Z3=R3 and Z4=R4 +jXL4
At balance,
(Zx)(Z3) = (Z2)(Z4),
from equation (3),
i.e. (Rx + jXLx)(R3) = (R2)(R4 + jXL4)
(ii)
Isolatingtheunknownimpedanceontheleft-hand
side of the equation gives
(Rx + jXLx) = R2

(R4 + jXL4)

Equating the real parts gives Rx = R2R4

EquatingtheimaginarypartsgivesXLx = R2XL4

(v)
Since XL =ωL, then
ωLx = R2(ωL4)
R3
from which Lx = R2L4

Thus at balance the unknown components in the simple
Maxwell bridge are given by
Rx = R2R4
R3
and Lx = R2L4
R3
These are known as the ‘balance equations’ for the
bridge.
(b)
The Hay bridge
This bridge is used to measure the resistance and induct-
ance of a coil having a very high Q-factor. A coil having
unknown resistance Rx and inductance Lx is shown in
the circuit diagram of a Hay bridge in Figure 30.3.
Following the procedure of Section 30.2 gives:

Since ω(=2πf ) appears in the balance equations, the
bridge is frequency-dependent.
(c)
The Owen bridge
This bridge is used to measure the resistance and
inductance of coils possessing a large value of induc-
tance. A coil having unknown resistance Rx and induc-
tance Lx is shown in the circuit diagram of an Owen
bridge in Figure 30.4, from which Zx =Rx +jXLx,
Z2 =R2 −jXC2, Z3=−jXC3 and Z4 =R4
Figure 30.4 Owen bridge
At balance (Zx)(Z3)=(Z2)(Z4), from equation(3), i.e.
(Rx + jXLx)(−jXC3) = (R2 −jXC2)(R4)
Rearranging gives Rx +jXLx = (R2 −jXC2)R4

By rationalizing and equating real and imaginary
parts it may be shown that at balance the unknown
components in the Owen bridge are given by
Rx = R4C3
C2
and Lx = R2R4C3
(d)
The Maxwell-Wien bridge
This bridge is used to measure the resistance and induct-
ance of a coil having a low Q-factor. A coil having
unknown resistance Rx and inductance Lx is shown
in the circuit diagram of a Maxwell-Wien bridge in
Figure 30.5, from which Zx =Rx +jXLx, Z2=R2 and

Whenever an arm of an a.c. bridge consists of two
branches in parallel, either method of obtaining
the equivalent impedance may be used.
For the Maxwell-Wien bridge of Figure 30.5, at
balance
(Zx)(Z3) = (Z2)(Z4), from equation (3)
i.e. (Rx +jXLx)(R3)(−jXC3)
(R3 −jXC3) =R2R4
using method (i) for Z3. Hence
(Rx + jXLx) = R2R4
(R3 −jXC3)
(R3)(−jXC3)
By rationalizing and equating real and imag-
inary parts it may be shown that at balance
the unknown components in the Maxwell-Wien
bridge are given by
Rx = R2R4
R3
and Lx = C3R2R4

The de Sauty bridge
This bridge provides a very simple method of mea-
suring a capacitance by comparison with another
known capacitance. In the de Sauty bridge shown in
Figure 30.6, Cx is an unknown capacitance and C4 is a
standard capacitor.

At balance
(Zx)(Z3) = (Z2)(Z4)

This simple bridge is usually inadequate in most practi-
cal cases. The power factor of the capacitor under test is
signiﬁcant because of internal dielectric losses – these
losses being the dissipation within a dielectric material
when an alternating voltage is applied to a capacitor.
(f)
The Schering bridge
This bridge is used to measure the capacitance and
equivalent series resistance of a capacitor. From the
measured values the power factor of insulating materials
and dielectric losses may be determined. In the circuit
diagram of a Schering bridge shown in Figure 30.7, C x
is the unknown capacitance and Rx its equivalent series
resistance.
From Figure 30.7, Zx =Rx −jXCx, Z2 =−jXC2
Z3 = (R3)(−jXC3)
(R3 −jXC3) and Z4 = R4
At balance, (Zx)(Z3)=(Z2)(Z4) from equation (3),

The loss in a dielectric may be represented by either (a) a
resistance in parallel with a capacitor or (b) a lossless
capacitor in series with a resistor.
If the dielectric is represented by an R–C circuit, as

itance if the frequency is known). It may also be used
as a frequency-stabilizing network.

Series resonance and
Q-factor
Why it is important to understand: Series resonance and Q-factor
Series resonance circuits are one of the most important circuits used in electrical and electronic engi-
neering. They can be found in various forms, such as in a.c. mains ﬁlters, noise ﬁlters and also in radio
and television tuning circuits, producing a very selective tuning circuit for the receiving of the different
frequency channels. Resonance may be achieved either by varying the frequency or by varying one of the
components, usually the capacitance, until the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal. Resonance
makes the circuit respond in a markedly different manner at the resonance frequency than at other
frequencies, a behaviour which is a basis of the selection process used in many communications systems,
such as the tuning of a radio. Resonance, Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity in a.c. series circuits are
explained in this chapter
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
state the conditions for resonance in an a.c. series circuit
•
calculate the resonant frequency in an a.c. series circuit,
fr =

2π√(LC)
•
deﬁne Q-factor as X
R and as VL
V or VC

•
determine the maximum value of VC and VCOIL and the frequency at which this occurs
•
determine the overall Q-factor for two components in series
•
deﬁne bandwidth and selectivity
•
calculate Q-factor and bandwidth in an a.c. series circuit
•
determine the current and impedance when the frequency deviates from the resonant frequency

31.1 Introduction
When the voltage V applied to an electrical network
containing resistance, inductance and capacitance is in
phase with the resulting current I, the circuit is said to
be resonant. The phenomenonof resonance is of great
value in all branches of radio, television and communi-
cations engineering, since it enables small portions of
the communications frequency spectrum to be selected
for ampliﬁcation independently of the remainder.
At resonance, the equivalent network impedance Z
is purely resistive since the supply voltage and current
are in phase. The power factor of a resonant network is
unity (i.e. power factor = cos φ = cos 0 = 1)
In electrical work there are two types of resonance –
one associated with series circuits (which was intro-
duced in Chapter 17), when the input impedance is
a minimum (which is discussed further in this chapter),
and the other associated with simple parallel networks,
when the input impedance is a maximum (which was
discussed in Chapter 18 and is further discussed in
Chapter 32).
31.2 Series resonance
Figure 31.1 shows a circuit comprising a coil of induc-
tance L and resistance R connected in series with
a capacitor C. The R–L–C series circuit has a total
impedance Z given by Z = R + j(XL −XC) ohms, or
Z = R + j(ωL −1/ωC) ohms where ω = 2πf . The cir-
cuit is at resonance when (XL −XC) = 0, i.e. when
XL = XC or ωL = 1/(ωC). The phasor diagram for this
condition is shown in Figure 31.2, where |VL| = |VC|
Since at resonance

Thus resonant frequency,
fr =

2π√(LC) hertz, since ωr = 2πfr
Figure 31.3 shows how inductive reactance XL and
capacitive reactance XC vary with the frequency.
At the resonant frequency fr, |XL| = |XC|. Since
impedance Z = R + j(XL −XC) and, at resonance,
(XL −XC) = 0, then impedance Z=R at resonance.
This is the minimum value possible for the impedance
as shown in the graph of the modulus of impedance,|Z|,
against frequency in Figure 31.4.
Figure 31.3 Variation of XL and XC with frequency
At frequencies less than fr,XL < XC and the circuit is
capacitive; at frequenciesgreater than fr,XL > XC and
the circuit is inductive.
CurrentI = V/Z.SinceimpedanceZ isaminimumvalue
at resonance, the current I has a maximum value. At
resonance, current I = V/R. A graph of current against
frequency is shown in Figure 31.4.

An R–L–C series circuit is
comprised of a coil of inductance 10mH and

Problem 3.
A coil having inductance L is
connected in series with a variable capacitor C.
The circuit possesses stray capacitance CS which is
assumed to be constant and effectively in parallel
with the variable capacitor C. When the capacitor is
set to 1000pF the resonant frequency of the circuit
is 92.5kHz, and when the capacitor is set to 500pF
the resonant frequency is 127.8kHz. Determine the
values of (a) the stray capacitance CS, and (b) the
coil inductance L.
For a series R–L–C circuit the resonant frequency fr is
given by:
fr =
1
2π√(LC)
The total capacitance of C in parallel with CS is given
by (C + CS)
At 92.5kHz, C = 1000pF. Hence
92.5 × 103 =
1
2π√[L(1000+ CS)10−12]
(1)
At 127.8kHz, C = 500pF. Hence
127.8 × 103 =

2π√[L(500 + CS)10−12]

(a)
Dividing equation (2) by equation (1) gives:

954.5 + 1.909CS =1000 + CS
1.909CS −CS =1000 −954.5
0.909CS =45.5
Thus stray capacitance CS = 45.5/0.909

Substituting CS = 50pF in equation (1) gives:

quency of the circuit is 86.85kHz, and when
the capacitor is set to 1.0nF the resonant fre-
quency is 120kHz. Determine the values of
(a) the stray circuit capacitance CS and (b) the
coil inductance L.
31.3 Q-factor
Q-factor is a ﬁgure of merit for a resonant device such
as an L–C–R circuit.
Such a circuit resonates by cyclic interchange of stored
energy, accompanied by energy dissipation due to the
resistance.
By deﬁnition, at resonance
Q = 2π
maximum energy stored
energy loss per cycle

Since the energy loss per cycle is equal to (the average
power dissipated) ×(periodic time),
Q = 2π

maximum energy stored
average power dissipated× periodic time

= 2π

maximum energy stored
average power dissipated× (1/fr)

since the periodic time T = 1/fr
Thus Q=2πfr
 maximum energy stored
average power dissipated

i.e.
Q=ωr
 maximum energy stored
average power dissipated

where ωr is the angular frequency at resonance.
In an L–C–R circuit both of the reactive elements
store energy during a quarter cycle of the alternating
supply input and return it to the circuit source during
the following quarter cycle. An inductor stores energy
in its magnetic ﬁeld, then transfers it to the electric ﬁeld
of the capacitor and then back to the magnetic ﬁeld,
and so on. Thus the inductive and capacitive elements
transfer energy from one to the other successively with
the source of supply ideally providing no additional
energy at all. Practical reactors both store and dissipate
energy.
Q-factor is an abbreviationfor quality factor and refers
to the ‘goodness’ of a reactive component.

From expressions (1) and (2) it can be deduced that
Q = XL
R = XC
R = reactance
resistance
In fact, Q-factor can also be deﬁned as
Q-factor = reactance power
resistance
= Q
P
where Q is the reactive power which is also the peak
rate of energy storage, and P is the average energy
dissipation rate. Hence
Q-factor = Q

i.e.

In an R–L–C series circuit the amount of energy stored
at resonance is constant.
When the capacitor voltage is a maximum, the inductor
current is zero, and vice versa, i.e. 1
2LIm2 = 1
2CV m2
Thus the Q-factor at resonance, Qr, is given by
Qr = ωrL

It should be noted that when Q-factor is referred to,
it is nearly always assumed to mean ‘the Q-factor at

and VC =IXC =

ωrC =


V = QrV
Hence, at resonance, VL = VC = QrV
or
Qr = VL (or VC)
V
The voltages VL and VC at resonance may be much
greater than that of the supply voltage V. For this reason
Q is often called the circuit magniﬁcation factor. It
represents a measure of the number of times VL or VC
is greater than the supply voltage.
The Q-factor at resonance can have a value of several
hundreds. Resonance is usually of interest only in cir-
cuits of Q-factor greater than about 10; circuits having
Q considerably below this value are effectively merely
operating at unity power factor.
Problem 4.
A series circuit comprises a 10
resistance, a 5μF capacitor and a variable
inductance L. The supply voltage is 20∠0◦volts at
a frequency of 318.3Hz. The inductance is adjusted
until the p.d. across the 10 resistance is a
maximum. Determine for this condition (a) the
value of inductance L, (b) the p.d. across each
component and (c) the Q-factor.

The maximum voltage across the resistance occurs
at resonance when the current is a maximum.

31.4 Voltage magniﬁcation
For a circuit with a high value of Q (say, exceeding
100), the maximum volt drop across the coil, V COIL,
and the maximum volt drop across the capacitor, V C,
coincide with the maximum circuit current at the
resonant frequency, fr, as shown in Figure 31.5(a).
However, if a circuit of low Q (say, less than 10) is used,
it may be shown experimentally that the maximum
value of VC occurs at a frequency less than fr while the
maximum value of VCOIL occurs at a frequency higher
than fr, as shown in Figure 31.5(b). The maximum
current, however, still occurs at the resonant frequency
with low Q. This is analysed below.

31.6 Bandwidth
Figure 31.6 shows how current I varies with fre-
quency f in an R–L–C series circuit. At the resonant
frequency, fr, current is a maximum value, shown as
Ir. Also shown are the points A and B where the cur-
rent is 0.707 of the maximum value at frequencies
f1 and f2. The power delivered to the circuit is I 2R.
At I = 0.707Ir, the power is (0.707Ir)2R = 0.5 I 2
r R,
i.e. half the power that occurs at frequency fr. The
points corresponding to f1 and f2 are called the half-
power points. The distance between these points, i.e.
(f2 −f1), is called the bandwidth.

Since Z = √2R, an isosceles triangle is formed by the
impedance triangles, as shown in Figure 31.7, where
ab = bc. From the impedance triangles it can be seen
that the equivalent circuit reactanceis equal to the circuit
resistance at the half-power points.
At f1, the lower half-power frequency |XC|>|XL| (see
Figure 31.4).

This is a quadratic equation in f1. Using the quadratic
formula gives:
f1 = −(2πCR) ± √[(2πCR)2 −4(4π2LC)(−1)]
2(4π2LC)
= −(2πCR) ± √[4π2C2R2 + 16π2LC]

Hence f1=−R±√[R2 +(4L/C)]

(since √[R2 + (4L/C)]>R and f1 cannot be negative).

Hence
2πfr = √[(2πf1)(2πf2)] and fr = √( f1 f2)
(11)
Selectivity is the ability of a circuit to respond more
readily to signals of a particular frequency to which it is
tuned than to signals of other frequencies. The response
becomes progressively weaker as the frequency departs
from the resonant frequency. Discrimination against
other signals becomes more pronouncedas circuit losses
are reduced, i.e. as the Q-factor is increased. Thus
Qr = fr/(f2 −f1) is a measure of the circuit selectivity
in terms of the points on each side of resonance where
the circuit current has fallen to 0.707 of its maximum
value reached at resonance. The higher the Q-factor,
the narrower the bandwidth and the more selective is
the circuit. Circuits having high Q-factors (say, in the
order 300) are therefore useful in communicationsengi-
neering. A high Q-factor in a series power circuit has
disadvantages in that it can lead to dangerously high
voltagesacrosstheinsulationandmayresultinelectrical
breakdown.
For example, suppose that the working voltage of a
capacitor is stated as 1kV and is used in a circuit having
a supply voltage of 240V. The maximum value of the
supply will be √2(240), i.e. 340V. The working voltage
of the capacitor would appear to be ample. However, if
the Q-factor is, say, 10, the voltage across the capacitor
will reach 2.4kV. Since the capacitor is rated only at
1kV, dielectric breakdown is more than likely to occur.
Low Q-factors, say, in the order of 5 to 25, may be
foundin power transformers using laminated iron cores.
A capacitor-start induction motor, as used in domestic
appliances such as washing machines and vacuum-
cleaners, having a Q-factor as low as 1.5 at starting
would result in a voltage across the capacitor 1.5 times
that of the supply voltage; hence the cable joining the
capacitor to the motor would require extra insulation.

From equation (11), resonant frequency,
fr = √(f1f2), i.e. 1200 = √(f1f2)
from which, f1f2 = (1200)2 = 1.44 × 106
(12)
From part (c),
f2 −f1 = 40
(13)
From equation (12), f1 = (1.44×106)/f2
Substituting in equation 13 gives:
f2 −1.44× 102
f2
= 40
Multiplying throughout by f2 gives:
f 2
2 −1.44× 106 = 40f2
i.e. f 2
2 −40f2 −1.44× 106 = 0
This is a quadratic equation in f2. Using the
quadratic formula gives:
f2 = 40 ± √[(40)2 −4(1.44× 106)]
2
= 40 ± 2400
2
= 40 + 2400

(since f2 cannot be negative)
Hence the upper half-power frequency,
f2 = 1220Hz
From equation (12), the lower half-power
frequency,
f1 = f2 −40 = 1220−40 = 1180Hz
Note that the upper and lower half-power fre-
quency values are symmetrically placed about the
resonance frequency. This is usually the case when
the Q-factor has a high value (say, >10).

Let ω1 be a frequency below the resonant frequency
ωr in an L–R–C series circuit, and ω2 be a frequency
above ωr by the same amount as ω1 is below, i.e.
ωr −ω1 = ω2 −ωr
Let the fractional deviation from the resonant frequency
be δ where

ωr

Hence ωrδ = ωr −ω1
and ωrδ = ω2 −ωr

Chapter 32
Parallel resonance and
Q-factor
Why it is important to understand: Parallel resonance and Q-factor
There are three basic conditions in a parallel circuit; dependent on frequency and component values,
the circuit will be operating below, above or at resonance. This chapter investigates the conditions for
parallel resonance, and explains dynamic impedance, Q-factor and bandwidth. One use for resonance
is to establish a condition of stable frequency in circuits designed to produce a.c. signals. Usually, a
parallel circuit is used for this purpose, with the capacitor and inductor directly connected together,
exchanging energy between each other. Just as a pendulum can be used to stabilise the frequency of a
clock mechanism’s oscillations, so can a parallel circuit be used to stabilise the electrical frequency of an
a.c. oscillator circuit. Another use for resonance is in applications where the effects of greatly increased
or decreased impedance at a particular frequency are desired. A resonant circuit can be used to block a
frequency or range of frequencies, thus acting as a sort of frequency ﬁlter to strain certain frequencies
out of a mix of others; these particular circuits are called ﬁlters.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
state the condition for resonance in an a.c. parallel network
•
calculate the resonant frequency in a.c. parallel networks
•
calculate dynamic resistance RD = L
CR in an a.c. parallel network
•
calculate Q-factor and bandwidth in an a.c. parallel network
•
determine the overall Q-factor for capacitors connected in parallel
•
determine the impedance when the frequency deviates from the resonant frequency
32.1 Introduction
A parallel network containingresistance R, pure induct-
ance L and pure capacitance C connected in parallel is
shown in Figure 32.1. Since the inductance and capaci-
tance are considered as pure components, this circuit is
something of an ‘ideal’ circuit. However, it may be used
to highlight some important points regarding resonance
which are applicable to any parallel circuit.

for the circuit shown in
Figure 32.1. At resonance, BC =BL and admittance
Y =G=1/R. This represents the condition of mini-
mum admittance for the circuit and thus maximum
impedance.

Since current I =V/Z =VY, the current is at a mini-
mum value at resonance in a parallel network.
From the ideal circuit of Figure 32.1 we have there-
fore established the following facts which apply to any
parallel circuit. At resonance:
(i)
admittance Y is a minimum
(ii)
impedance Z is a maximum
(iii)
current I is a minimum
(iv)
an expression for the resonant frequencyf r may
be obtained by making the ‘imaginary’ part of
the complex expression for admittance equal to
zero.

tance L and resistance R in parallel with a pure

above method may be applied to any parallel network,

32.3 Dynamic resistance
Since the current at resonance is in phase with the volt-
age, the impedance of the network acts as a resistance.
This resistance is known as the dynamic resistance,
RD. Impedance at resonance, RD =V/Ir, where Ir is the
current at resonance.

32.5 Q-factor in a parallel network
The Q-factor in the series R–L–C circuit is a measure
of the voltage magniﬁcation. In a parallel circuit, cur-
rents higher than the supply current can circulate within
the parallel branches of a parallel resonant network, the
current leaving the capacitor and establishing the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the inductance, this then collapsing and
recharging the capacitor, and so on. The Q-factor of a
parallel resonant circuit is the ratio of the current circu-
lating in the parallel branches of the circuit to the supply
current, i.e. in a parallel circuit, Q-factor is a measure
of the current magniﬁcation.
Figure 32.5
Circulating currents may be several hundreds of
times greater than the supply current at resonance. For
the parallel network of Figure 32.5, the Q-factor at
resonance is given by:
Qr = circulating current
current at resonance =
capacitor current
current at resonance
= IC
Ir
Current in capacitor, IC =V/XC =V ωrC
Current at resonance, Ir = V
RD
=

L/CR = VCR

Hence Qr = IC
Ir
= V ωrC

i.e. Qr = ωrL
R
the same expression as for series resonance.
The difference between the resonant frequency of
a series circuit and that of a parallel circuit can be
quite small. The resonant frequency of a coil in par-
allel with a capacitor is shown in equation (3); however,
around the closed loop comprising the coil and capac-
itor the energy would naturally resonate at a frequency
given by that for a series R–L–C circuit, as shown in
Chapter 31. This latter frequency is termed the natural
frequency, f n, and the frequency of resonance seen at
the terminals of Figure 32.5 is often called the forced
resonant frequency, f r. (For a series circuit, the forced
and natural frequencies coincide.)
From the coil–capacitor loop of Figure 32.5,
fn =

difference between fr and fn tends to be very small.
A high value of Q makes the parallel resonant frequency
tend to the same value as that of the series resonant
frequency.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
The expressions already obtained in Chapter 31 for
bandwidth and resonant frequencyalso apply to parallel
circuits,
i.e.
Qr = fr/( f2 −f1)

and
fr = √( f1 f2)
(8)
The overall Q-factor QT of two parallel components
having different Q-factors is given by:
QT =

(9)
as for the series circuit.
By similar reasoningto that of the series R–L–C circuit,
it may be shown that at the half-power frequencies the
admittance is √2 times its minimum value at resonance
and, since Z =1/Y, the value of impedance at the half-
power frequencies is 1/√2 or 0.707 times its maximum
value at resonance.
By similar analysis to that given in Chapter 31, it may
be shown that for a parallel network:
Y
Yr
= RD
Z = 1 + j2δQ
(10)
where Y is the circuit admittance, Yr is the admit-
tance at resonance, Z is the network impedance and RD
is the dynamic resistance (i.e. the impedance at reso-
nance) and δ is the fractional deviation from the resonant
frequency.

Introduction to network
analysis
Why it is important to understand: Introduction to network analysis
Network analysis is any structured technique used to mathematically analyse a circuit or a network of
interconnected components. Quite often a technician or engineer will encounter circuits containing mul-
tiple sources of power or component conﬁgurations which defy simpliﬁcation by series/parallel analysis
techniques using Ohm’s law. In such cases, other means are required. This and the following chapters
present some techniques useful in analysing such complex circuits. These are a collection of techniques for
ﬁnding the voltages and currents in every component of the network. Network analysis is the process by
which designers and manufacturers measure the electrical performance of the components and circuits
used in more complex systems. When these systems are conveying signals with information content, there
is a concern with getting the signal from one point to another with maximum efﬁciency and minimum
distortion. This chapter introduces the techniques of network analysis, solves simultaneous equations in
two and three unknowns, and uses Kirchhoff’s laws to determine unknown values of branch currents.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
appreciate available methods of analysing networks
•
solve simultaneous equations in two and three unknowns using determinants
•
analyse a.c. networks using Kirchhoff’s laws
33.1 Introduction
Voltage sources in series–parallel networks cause cur-
rents to ﬂow in each branch of the circuit and
corresponding volt drops occur across the circuit com-
ponents. A.c. circuit (or network) analysis involves the
determination of the currents in the branches and/or the
voltages across components.
The laws which determine the currents and voltage
drops in a.c. networks are:
(a)
current, I =V/Z, where Z
is the complex
impedance
and
V
the
voltage
across
the
impedance;
(b)
the laws for impedances in series and parallel,
i.e. total impedance,

Kirchhoff’s laws, which may be stated as:
(i) ‘Atanypointinanelectricalcircuitthephasor
sum of the currents ﬂowing towards that junc-
tion is equal to the phasor sum of the currents
ﬂowing away from the junction.’
(ii) ‘In any closed loop in a network, the phasor
sum of the voltage drops (i.e. the products of
current and impedance) takenaroundthe loop
is equal to the phasor sum of the e.m.f.s acting
in that loop.’
In any circuit the currents and voltages at any point may
be determined by applying Kirchhoff’s laws (as demon-
strated in this chapter), or by extensions of Kirchhoff’s
laws, called mesh-current analysis and nodal analysis
(see Chapter 34).
However, for more complicated circuits, a number of
circuit theorems have been developed as alternatives to
the use of Kirchhoff’s laws to solve problems involving
both d.c. and a.c. electrical networks. These include:
(a)
the superposition theorem (see Chapter 35)
(b)
Thévenin’s theorem (see Chapter 36)
(c)
Norton’s theorem (see Chapter 36)
(d)
the maximum power transfer theorems (see
Chapter 38).
In addition to these theorems,andoftenusedas a prelim-
inary to using circuit theorems,star–delta(orT −π) and
delta–star (or π −T ) transformations provide a method
for simplifying certain circuits (see Chapter 37).
In a.c. circuit analysis involving Kirchhoff’s laws
or circuit theorems, the use of complex numbers is
essential.
The above laws and theorems apply to linear cir-
cuits, i.e. circuits containing impedances whose values
are independent of the direction and magnitude of the
current ﬂowing in them.
33.2 Solution of simultaneous
equations using determinants
When Kirchhoff’slaws are applied to electrical circuits,
simultaneous equations result which require solution.
If two loops are involved, two simultaneous equations
containing two unknowns need to be solved; if three
loops are involved, three simultaneous equations con-
taining three unknowns need to be solved and so on.
The elimination and substitution methods of solving
simultaneous equations may be used to solve such equa-
tions. However, a more convenient method is to use
determinants.
Two unknowns
When solving linear simultaneous equations in two
unknowns using determinants:
(i)
the equations are initially written in the form:
a1x +b1y +c1 = 0
a2x +b2y +c2 = 0
(ii)
the solution is given by:

To evaluate a 3×3 determinant:
(a)
The minor of an element of a 3 by 3 matrix is
the value of the 2 by 2 determinant obtained by
covering up the row and column containing that
element.
Thus for the matrix
⎛
⎝
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
⎞
⎠the minor of
element 4 is the determinant
!!!!
2 3
8 9
!!!!
i.e. (2×9)−(3×8)=18−24=−6
Similarly, the minor of element 3 is
!!!!
4 5
7 8
!!!!
i.e. (4×8)−(5×7)=32−35=−3
(b)
The sign of the minor depends on its posi-
tion within the matrix, the sign pattern being
⎛
⎝
+ −+
−+ −

⎞
⎠. Thus the signed minor of element
4 in the above matrix is −

The signed-minor of an element is called the
cofactor of the element.
Thus the cofactor of element 2 is

(c)
The value of a 3 by 3 determinant is the sum of
the products of the elements and their cofactors
of any row or any column of the corresponding
3 by 3 matrix.
Thus a 3 by 3 determinant

Determinants are used to solve simultaneous equations
in some of the following problems and in Chapter 34.
33.3 Network analysis using
Kirchhoff’s* laws
Kirchhoff’s∗laws may be applied to both d.c. and
a.c. circuits. The laws are introduced in Chapter 15 for
d.c. circuits. To demonstrate the method of analysis,
consider the d.c. network shown in Figure 33.1. If the
current ﬂowing in each branch is required,the following
three-step procedure may be used:
(i)
Label branch currents and their directions
on the circuit diagram. The directions chosen
are arbitrarybut, as a starting point, a useful guide

Part 4

Figure 33.1
is to assume that current ﬂows from the positive
terminals of the voltage sources. This is shown
in Figure 33.2 where the three branch currents
are expressed in terms of I1 and I2 only, since
the current through resistance R, by Kirchhoff’s
current law, is (I1 +I2).
Figure 33.2
(ii)
Divide the circuit into loops – two in this case (see
Figure 33.2) and then apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to each loop in turn. From loop ABEF, and
moving in a clockwise direction (the choice of
loop direction is arbitrary), E1 =I1r +(I1 +I2)R
(note that the two voltage drops are positive
since the loop direction is the same as the
current directions involved in the volt drops).
Hence
8 = I1 + 5(I1 + I2)
or
6I1 + 5I2 = 8
(1)
From loop BCDE in Figure 33.2, and moving in
an anticlockwise direction (note that the direction
does not have to be the same as that used for the
ﬁrst loop), E2 =I2r2 +(I1 +I2)R,
i.e.
3 = 2I2 + 5(I1 + I2)
or
5I1 + 7I2 = 3
(2)
(iii)
Solve simultaneous equations (1) and (2) for I1
and I2.
Multiplying equation (1) by 7 gives:
42I1 + 35I2 = 56
(3)
Multiplying equation (2) by 5 gives:
25I1 + 35I2 = 15
(4)
Equation (3) −equation (4) gives:
17I1 = 41
from which, current I1 = 41/17 = 2.412A =
2.41A, correct to two decimal places.
From equation (1): 6(2.412) + 5I2 = 8, from
which,
current I2 = 8−6(2.412)
5
=−1.294A
=−1.29A, correct to two decimal
places.
The minus sign indicates that current I2 ﬂows in the
opposite direction to that shown in Figure 33.2.
The current ﬂowing through resistance R is
(I1 +I2) = 2.412+(−1.294)=1.118A
= 1.12A, correct to two decimal places.
[A third loop may be selected in Figure 33.2 (just as
a check), moving clockwise around the outside of the
network.
Then E1 −E2 =I1r1 −I2r2 i.e. 8−3=I1 −2I2. Thus
5=2.412−2(−1.294)=5]
An alternative method of solving equations (1) and (2)
is shown below using determinants. Since
6I1 + 5I2 −8 = 0

5I1 + 7I2 −3 = 0

The aboveprocedureis shown fora simple d.c. circuit
having two unknown values of current. The procedure,
however, applies equally well to a.c. networks and/or
to circuits where three unknown currents are involved.
This is illustrated in the following problems.
Problem 1.
Use Kirchhoff’s laws to ﬁnd the
current ﬂowing in each branch of the network
shown in Figure 33.3.
Figure 33.3
(i)
The branch currents and their directions are
labelled as shown in Figure 33.4
Figure 33.4
(ii)
Two loops are chosen. From loop ABEF, and
moving clockwise,
25I1+20(I1 +I2) = 100∠0◦
i.e.
45I1+20I2 = 100
(1)
From loop BCDE, and moving anticlockwise,
10I2 +20(I1 +I2) = 50∠90◦
i.e.
20I1 +30I2 = j50
(2)
3 × equation (1) gives: 135I1 + 60I2 = 300
(3)
2 × equation (2) gives: 40I1 + 60I2 = j100 (4)
Equation (3) −equation (4) gives:
95I1 = 300 −j100
from which, current I1 = 300 −j100
95
= 3.329∠∠∠−18.43◦A or
(3.158−j1.052)A
Substituting in equation (1) gives:
45(3.158−j1.052)+20I2 =100, from which,
I2 = 100 −45(3.158 −j1.052)
20
= (−2.106+ j2.367)A or 3.168∠∠∠131.66◦A
Thus
I1 + I2 = (3.158 −j1.052) + (−2.106 + j2.367)
= (1.052+ j1.315)A or 1.684∠∠∠51.34◦A

2 resistor of the circuit shown in Figure 33.5
using Kirchhoff’s laws. Find also the power
dissipated in the 3 resistance.

anticlockwise,
5I1 + 6I2 + 4(I2 −I3) = 8
i.e.
5I1 + 10I2 −4I3 = 8
(1)
From loop EDGF, and moving clockwise,
6I2 + 2I3 −1(I1 −I2) = 0
i.e.
−I1 + 7I2 + 2I3 = 0
(2)
From loop DCHG, and moving anticlockwise,
2I3 + 3(I1 −I2 + I3) −4(I2 −I3) = 0
i.e.
3I1 −7I2 + 9I3 = 0
(iii)
Thus 5I1+10I2 −4I3 −8 = 0
−I1 +7I2 +2I3 +0 = 0
3I1 −7I2 +9I3+0 = 0

Hence
I1 = 616
591 = 1.042A,
I2 = 120
591 = 0.203A and
I3 = −112
591 = −0.190A
Thus the current ﬂowing in the 2 resistance is
0.190A in the opposite direction to that shown in
Figure 33.6.
Current in the 3  resistance = I1 −I2 + I3
= 1.042−0.203 + (−0.190) = 0.649A
Hencepower dissipated in the 3 resistance,
I2(3)=(0.649)2(3)=1.26W

For the a.c. network shown in

i.e.
5 = (9 + j12)I1 −(6 + j8)I2
(1)

Part 4

From loop BCDE,
(2 + j4) = I2(2 −j5) −(I1 −I2)(6 + j8)
i.e.(2 + j4) = −(6 + j8)I1 + (8 + j3)I2
(2)
(iii)
Multiplying equation (1) by (8+j3) gives:
5(8 + j3) = (8 + j3)(9 + j12)I1
−(8 + j3)(6 + j8)I2
(3)
Multiplying equation (2) by (6+j8) gives:
(6 + j8)(2+ j4) = −(6 + j8)(6 + j8)I1
+(6 + j8)(8 + j3)I2
(4)
Adding equations (3) and (4) gives:
5(8+j3)+(6+j8)(2+j4)=[(8+j3)(9+j12)
−(6 + j8)(6 + j8)]I1
i.e.
(20 + j55) = (64 + j27)I1
from which, I1 = 20+j55
64+j27 = 58.52∠70.02◦
69.46∠22.87◦
= 0.842∠∠∠47.15◦A
= (0.573+j0.617)A
= (0.57+ j0.62)A, correct to two
decimal places.
From equation (1), 5 = (9 + j12)(0.573 + j0.617)
−(6 + j8)I2
5 = (−2.247 + j12.429)

Mesh-current and nodal
analysis
Why it is important to understand: Mesh-current and nodal analysis
When circuits become large and complicated, it is useful to have various methods for simplifying and
analysing the circuit. There is no perfect formula for solving a circuit; depending on the type of circuit,
there are different methods that can be employed to solve the circuit. Some methods might not work,
and some methods may be very difﬁcult in terms of long mathematical problems. Two of the most
important methods for solving circuits are mesh current analysis and nodal analysis. Mesh analysis is the
application of Kirchhoff’svoltagelaw to solve for mesh currents, whereas nodal analysis is the application
of Kirchhoff’s current law to solve for the voltages at each node in a network. Mesh analysis is often easier
as it requires fewer unknowns. This chapter demonstrates how to solve d.c. and a.c. networks using mesh
and nodal analysis.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
solve d.c. and a.c. networks using mesh-current analysis
•
solve d.c. and a.c. networks using nodal analysis
34.1 Mesh-current analysis
Mesh-current analysis is merely an extension of the
use of Kirchhoff’s laws, explained in Chapter 33.
Figure 34.1 shows a network whose circulating currents
I1,I2 and I3 have been assigned to closed loops in the
circuit rather than to branches. Currents I1, I2 and I3 are
called mesh-currents or loop-currents.
In mesh-current analysis the loop-currents are
all arranged to circulate in the same direction (in

Figure 34.1, shown as clockwise direction). Kirchhoff’s
second law is applied to each of the loops in turn, which
in the circuit of Figure 34.1 produces three equations in
three unknowns which may be solved for I1,I2 and I3.
The three equations produced from Figure 34.1 are:
I1(Z1 + Z2) −I2Z2 = E1
I2(Z2 + Z3 + Z4) −I1Z2 −I3Z4 = 0
I3(Z4 + Z5) −I2Z4 = −E2
The branch currents are determinedbytakingthe pha-
sor sum of the mesh currents common to that branch.
For example, the current ﬂowing in impedance Z 2 of
Figure34.1isgivenby(I1−I2)phasorially.Themethod
of mesh-current analysis, called Maxwell’s theorem, is
demonstrated in the following problems.
Problem 1.
Use mesh-current analysis to
determine the current ﬂowing in (a) the 5
resistance and (b) the 1 resistance of the d.c.
circuit shown in Figure 34.2.

34.2 Nodal analysis
A node of a network is deﬁned as a point where two
or more branches are joined. If three or more branches
join at a node, then that node is called a principal node
or junction. In Figure 34.13, points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are
nodes, and points 1, 2 and 3 are principal nodes.
Figure 34.13

Part 4
512
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
A node voltage is the voltage of a particular node
with respect to a node called the reference node. If in
Figure 34.13, for example, node 3 is chosen as the ref-
erence node then V13 is assumed to mean the voltage
at node 1 with respect to node 3 (as distinct from V31).
Similarly, V23 would be assumed to mean the voltage
at node 2 with respect to node 3, and so on. However,
since the node voltage is always determined with respect
to a particular chosen reference node, the notation V 1
for V13 and V2 for V23 would always be used in this
instance.
The object of nodal analysis is to determine the val-
ues of voltages at all the principal nodes with respect
to the reference node, e.g., to ﬁnd voltages V1 and
V2 in Figure 34.13. When such voltages are deter-
mined, the currents ﬂowing in each branch can be
found.
Kirchhoff’s current law is applied to nodes 1 and 2
in turn in Figure 34.13 and two equations in unknowns
V1 and V2 are obtained which may be simultaneously
solved using determinants.
Figure 34.14
The branches leading to node 1 are shown separately
in Figure 34.14. Let us assume that all branch currents
are leaving the node as shown. Since the sum of currents
at a junction is zero,
V1 −Vx
ZA
+ V1
ZD
+ V1 −V2
ZB
= 0
(1)
Similarly, for node 2, assuming all branch currents are
leaving the node as shown in Figure 34.15,
V2 −V1
ZB
+ V2
ZE
+ V2 + VY
ZC
= 0
(2)
In equations (1) and (2), the currents are all assumed to
be leaving the node. In fact, any selection in the direc-
tion of the branch currents may be made – the resulting
equations will be identical. (For example, if for node
1 the current ﬂowing in ZB is considered as ﬂowing
towards node 1 instead of away, then the equation for
node 1 becomes
V1 −Vx
ZA
+ V1
ZD
= V2 −V1
ZB
which if rearranged is seen to be exactly the same as
equation (1).

Current equations, and hence voltage equations, may
be written at each principal node of a network with the
exception of a reference node. The number of equations
necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is, in fact,
always one less than the number of principal nodes.
Whether mesh-current analysis or nodal analysis
is used to determine currents in circuits depends on
the number of loops and nodes the circuit contains.

Basically, the method that requires the least number
of equations is used. The method of nodal analysis is
demonstrated in the following problems.

For the network shown in

nodal analysis.
Figure 34.16
Figure 34.16 contains two principal nodes (at 1 and B)
and thus only one nodal equation is required. B is taken
as the reference node and the equation for node 1 is
obtained as follows. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law
to node 1 gives:
IX + IY = I

The

Hence the voltage drop between points A and B, i.e.

Problem 5.
Determine the value of voltage VXY
shown in the circuit of Figure 34.17.

The circuit contains no principal nodes. However, if
point Y is chosen as the reference node then an equation
may be written for node X assuming that current leaves
point X by both branches.

Chapter 35
The superposition theorem
Why it is important to understand: The superposition theorem
The strategy used in the superposition theorem is to eliminate all but one voltage source within a network
at a time, using series/parallel circuit analysis to determine voltage drops, and/or currents, within the
modiﬁed network for each voltage source separately. Then, once voltage drops and/or currents have been
determined for each voltage source working separately, the values are all ‘superimposed’ on top of each
other, i.e. added algebraically, to determine the actual voltage drops/currents with all sources active. The
superposition theorem is very important in circuit analysis; it is used in converting any circuit into its
Norton equivalent or Thévenin equivalent (which will be explained in the next chapter).
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
solve d.c. and a.c. networks using the superposition theorem
35.1 Introduction
The superposition theorem states:
‘In any network made up of linear impedances and
containing more than one source of e.m.f. the resul-
tant current ﬂowing in any branch is the phasor sum
of the currents that would ﬂow in that branch if each
source were considered separately, all other sources
being replaced at that time by their respective internal
impedances.’
35.2 Using the superposition
theorem
The superposition theorem, which was introduced in
Chapter 15 for d.c. circuits, may be applied to both
d.c. and a.c. networks. A d.c. network is shown in
Figure 35.1 and will serve to demonstrate the principle
of application of the superposition theorem.
Figure 35.1
To ﬁnd the current ﬂowing in each branch of
the circuit, the following six-step procedure can be
adopted:
(i)
Redraw the original network with one of the
sources, say E2, removed and replaced by r2only,
as shown in Figure 35.2.
(ii)
Label the current in each branch and its direc-
tion as shown in Figure 35.2, and then determine
its value. The choice of current direction for
I1 depends on the source polarity which, by
convention, is taken as ﬂowing from the positive
terminal as shown.

Determine the algebraic sum of the currents ﬂow-

From Figure 35.6, the resultant current ﬂowing
through the 8 V source is given by
I1−I6 = 3.294−0.8825=2.41A
(discharging,
i.e. ﬂowing from the positive terminal of the
source).

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
The resultant current ﬂowing in the 3V source is
given by
I3−I4=2.353−1.059 = 1.29A (charging, i.e.
ﬂowing into the positive terminal of the source).
The resultant currentﬂowingin the 5 resistance
is given by
I2 + I5 = 0.941 + 0.177 = 1.12 A
The values of current are the same as those
obtained on page 500 by using Kirchhoff’s laws.
The following problems demonstrate further the use
of the superposition theorem in analysing a.c. as well
as d.c. networks. The theorem is straightforward to
apply, but is lengthy. Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems
(described in Chapter 36) produce results more quickly.

A.c. sources of 100∠0◦V and internal
resistance 25, and 50∠90◦V and internal
resistance 10, are connected in parallel across a

theorem, the current in the 20 load and the
current in each voltage source.
(This is the same problem as Problem 1 on page 501 and
Problem 6 on page 513 and a comparison of methods
may be made.)

Chapter 36
Thévenin’s and Norton’s
theorems
Why it is important to understand: Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems
Two powerful circuit analysis techniques are Thévenin’s theorem and Norton’s theorem. Both theorems
convert a complex circuit to a simpler series or parallel equivalent circuit for easier analysis. Analysis
involves removing part of the circuit across two terminals to aid calculation, later combining the circuit
with the Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit. Thévenin’s theorem was independently derived in 1853
by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1883 by Léon Charles Thévenin (1857–1926),
an electrical engineer with France’s national Postes et Télégraphes telecommunications organization.
Norton’s theorem is an extension of Thévenin’s theorem and was introduced in 1926 separately by two
people: Hause-Siemens researcher Hans Ferdinand Mayer (1895–1980) and Bell Labs engineer Edward
Lawry Norton (1898–1983). This chapter explains both theorems, analysing both d.c. and a.c. networks
through calculations.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
understand and use Thévenin’s theorem to analyse a.c. and d.c. networks
•
understand and use Norton’s theorem to analyse a.c. and d.c. networks
•
appreciate and use the equivalence of Thévenin and Norton networks
36.1 Introduction
Many of the networks analysed in Chapters 33, 34 and
35 using Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh-current and nodal
analysis and the superposition theorem can be analysed
more quickly and easily byusingThévenin’s or Norton’s
theorems. Each of these theorems involves replacing
what may be a complicated network of sources and lin-
ear impedances with a simple equivalent circuit. A set
procedure may be followed when using each theorem,
the procedures themselves requiring a knowledge of
basic circuit theory. (It may be worth checking some
general d.c. circuit theory in Section 15.4. page 226,
before proceeding.)

Part 4
Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems
529
36.2 Thévenin’s theorem
Thévenin’s∗theorem states:
‘The current which ﬂows in any branch of a network is
the same as that which would ﬂow in the branch if it
were connected across a source of electrical energy,
the e.m.f. of which is equal to the potential differ-
ence which would appear across the branch if it were
open-circuited, and the internal impedance of which
is equal to the impedance which appears across the
open-circuited branch terminals when all sources are
replaced by their internal impedances.’
The theorem applies to any linear active network (‘lin-
ear’ meaning that the measured values of circuit com-
ponents are independent of the direction and magnitude
of the current ﬂowing in them, and ‘active’ meaning that
it contains a source, or sources, of e.m.f.).
The above statement of Thévenin’s theorem simply
means that a complicated network with output termi-
nals AB, as shown in Figure 36.1(a), can be replaced by
a single voltage source E in series with an impedance z,
as shown in Figure 36.1(b). E is the open-circuit volt-
age measured at terminals AB and z is the equivalent
impedance of the network at the terminals AB when all
internal sources of e.m.f. are made zero. The polarity of
voltage E is chosen so that the current ﬂowing through

ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
an impedance connected between A and B will have the
samedirectionaswouldresultiftheimpedancehadbeen
connected between A and B of the original network.
Figure 36.1(b) is known as the Thévenin equivalent
circuit, and was initially introduced in Section 15.5,
page 228 for d.c. networks.
The following four-step procedure can be adopted
when determining, by means of Thévenin’s theorem,
the current ﬂowing in a branch containing impedance
ZL of an active network:
(i)
remove the impedance ZL from that branch;
(ii)
determine the open-circuit voltage E across the
break;
(iii)
remove each source of e.m.f. and replace it by
its internal impedance (if it has zero internal
impedance then replace it by a short-circuit),
and then determine the internal impedance, z,
‘looking in’ at the break;
(iv)
determine the current from the Thévenin equiva-
lent circuit shown in Figure 36.2, i.e.
current iL =
E
ZL + z
Figure 36.2
A simple d.c. network (Figure 36.3) serves to demon-
strate how the above procedure is applied to determine
the current ﬂowing in the 5 resistance by using
Thévenin’s theorem. This is the same network as used
in Chapter 33 when it was solved using Kirchhoff’s
laws (see page 500), and by means of the superposition

branches of the circuit ofFigure36.3,basic circuit
theory is used. Thus, from Figure 36.7, voltage
V =(1.1177)(5)=5.5885V

Then
V = E1 −IAr1, i.e. 5.5885 = 8 −IA(1),
from which
current IA = 8 −5.5885 = 2.41A
Similarly, V = E2 −IBr2, i.e. 5.5885

(i.e. ﬂowing in the direction opposite to that

Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems

The Thévenin theorem procedure used above may be
applied to a.c. as well as d.c. networks, as shown below.
An a.c. network is shown in Figure 36.8, where it
is required to ﬁnd the current ﬂowing in the (6+j8)
impedance by using Thévenin’s theorem.
Figure 36.8
Using the above procedure
(i)
The (6+j8)  impedance is removed, as shown
in Figure 36.9(a).
(ii)
The open-circuit voltage across the break is now
required. The network is redrawn for convenience
as shown in Figure 36.9(b), where current
I1 = (5 + j0) + (2+ j4)
(3 + j4) + (2−j5) = (7 + j4)
(5 −j)
= 1.581∠41.05◦A
Hence open-circuit voltage across AB,
E = E1 −I1(3 + j4), i.e.
E = (5 + j0) −(1.581∠41.05◦)(5∠53.13◦)
from which E =9.657∠−54.73◦V
(iii)
From Figure 36.10, the impedance z ‘looking in’
at terminals AB is given by
z =
(3 + j4)(2−j5)
(3 + j4) + (2−j5)
= 5.281∠−3.76◦ or (5.270−j0.346)

The Thévenin equivalent circuit is shown in

iL =
E
ZL + z =
9.657∠−54.73◦
(6 + j8) + (5.270−j0.346)

iL = 9.657∠−54.73◦

The network of Figure 36.8 is analysed using Kirch-
hoff’s laws in Problem 3, page 502, and by the super-
position theorem in Problem 4, page 523. The above
analysis using Thévenin’s theorem is seen to be much
quicker.

Note that, to ﬁnd the current in the capacitor,
only the capacitor need have been initially

often result in a simpler solution.

From Figure 36.13,
current I1 =

across the 20k resistor, i.e.
E = (8 × 10−3)(20 × 103) = 160V
(iii)
Removing the 200∠0◦V source gives the
network shown in Figure 36.14.

One method of analysing a multi-branch network as
shown in Figure 36.22 is to use Thévenin’s theorem
on one part of the network at a time. For example, the
part of the circuit to the left of AA may be reduced to a
Thévenin equivalent circuit.
From Figure 36.23,

100 = 80V, by voltage division
and z1 = 20 × 5

Thus the network of Figure 36.22 reduces to that
of Figure 36.24. The part of the network shown in

Thévenin equivalent circuit, where

(80) = 40V
and z2 = 50 × 50
50 + 50 = 25
Thus the original network reduces to that shown in

Current I1 shown in Figure 36.32 is given by
I1 =
24∠0◦
(4 + j3 −j3) = 24∠0◦
4∠0◦= 6∠0◦A
The Thévenin equivalent voltage, i.e. the open-circuit
voltage across terminals AB, is given by
E=I1(4+j3)=(6∠0◦)(5∠36.87◦) = 30∠∠∠36.87◦V
When the 24∠0◦V source is removed, the impedance z
‘looking in’ at AB is given by
z = (4 + j3)(−j3)
(4 + j3 −j3) = 9 −j12

= (2.25−j3.0)
Thus the Thévenin equivalent circuit is as shown in
Figure 36.33.
Figure 36.33
(a)
When a (3.75+j11) impedance is connected
across terminals AB, the current I ﬂowing in the
impedance is given by
I =
30∠36.87◦
(3.75 + j11) + (2.25 −j3.0) = 30∠36.87◦
10∠53.13◦
=3∠−16.26◦A
Hence the current ﬂowing in the (3.75+ j11)
impedance is 3A
(b)
P.d. across
the (3.75+j11) impedance is
given by
V = (3∠−16.26◦)(3.75 + j11)

Hence the magnitude of the p.d. across the

Problem 6.
Use Thévenin’s theorem to determine
the current ﬂowing in the capacitor of the network
shown in Figure 36.34.

The capacitor is removed from branch AB, as

(ii)
The open-circuit voltage, E, shown in Figure
36.35, is given by (I2)(5). I2 may be determined
by current division if I1 is known. (Alternatively,
E may be determined by the method used in
Problem 4.)
Current I1 =V/Z, where Z is the total circuit
impedance and V =16.55∠−22.62◦V.
Impedance, Z = 4 + (j2)(8 + j6)
j2 + 8 + j6

(iii)
If the 16.55∠−22.62◦V source is removed from
Figure 36.35, the impedance, z, ‘looking in’ at
AB is given by
z = 5[((4 × j2)/(4 + j2)) + (3 + j6)]

The open-circuit voltage E across PQ is the phasor
sum of V1, Vx and V2, as shown in Figure 36.38.

= (3.181 + j0.701)V or 3.257∠12.43◦V,
i.e. the open-circuit voltage across AB is given by
E = 3.257∠12.43◦V
Point C is at a potential of 30∠0◦V. Between C
and A is a volt drop of 21.83∠−14.04◦V. Hence
the voltage at point A is
30∠0◦−21.83∠−14.04◦= 10.29∠∠∠30.98◦V
Between points C and B is a voltage drop of
18.97∠−18.43◦V. Hence the voltage at point B
is 30∠0◦−18.97∠−18.43◦=13.42∠∠∠26.55◦V.
Since the magnitude of the voltage at B is higher
than at A, current must ﬂow in the direction B
to A.
(iii)
Replacing the 30∠0◦V source with a short-circuit
(i.e. zero internal impedance) gives the network
shown in Figure 36.42(a). The network is shown
redrawn in Figure 36.42(b) and simpliﬁed in

(40 + 20+ j20)

36.4 Norton’s theorem
A source of electrical energy can be represented by
a source of e.m.f. in series with an impedance. In
Section 36.2, the Thévenin constant-voltage source
consisted of a constant e.m.f., E, which may be alter-
nating or direct, in series with an internal impedance, z.

Part 4
540
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
However, this is not the only form of representation.
A source of electrical energy can also be represented
by a constant-current source, which may be alternating
or direct, in parallel with an impedance. It is shown in
Section 36.5 that the two forms are in fact equivalent.
Norton’s∗theorem states:
‘The current that ﬂows in any branch of a network is the
same as that which would ﬂow in the branch if it were
connectedacrossasourceofelectricalenergy,theshort-
circuit current of which is equal tothe currentthatwould
ﬂowinashort-circuitacrossthebranch,andtheinternal
impedance of which is equal to the impedance which
appears across the open-circuited branch terminals.’
The above statement simply means that any linear
active network with output terminals AB, as shown
in Figure 36.48(a), can be replaced by a current
source in parallel with an impedance z as shown in
Figure 36.48(b). Theequivalent currentsource I SC (note
the symbol in Figure 36.48(b) as per BS EN 60617-
2:1996) is the current through a short-circuit applied
to the terminals of the network. The impedance z is
the equivalent impedance of the network at the termi-
nals AB when all internal sources of e.m.f. are made
zero. Figure 36.48(b) is known as the Norton equiva-
lentcircuit,andwasinitiallyintroducedinSection15.7,

36.5 Thévenin and Norton equivalent
networks
It is seen in Sections 36.2and 36.4 that when Thévenin’s
and Norton’s theorems are applied to the same circuit,
identical results are obtained. Thus the Thévenin and
Norton networks shown in Figure 36.79 are equivalent
to each other. The impedance ‘looking in’ at terminals
AB is the same in each of the networks, i.e. z.
Figure 36.79 Equivalent Thévenin and Norton circuits
If terminals AB in Figure 36.79(a) are short-circuited,
the short-circuit current is given by E/z
If terminals AB in Figure 36.79(b) are short-circuited,
the short-circuit current is ISC
Thus
ISC = E/z
Figure 36.80 shows a source of e.m.f. E in series with
an impedance z feeding a load impedance ZL. From
Figure 36.80,
Figure 36.80
IL =

i.e.

ISC, from above.
From Figure 36.81 it can be seen that, when viewed
from the load, the source appears as a source of current
ISC which is divided between z and ZL connected in
parallel.
Figure 36.81
Thus it is shown that the two representations shown in
Figure 36.79 are equivalent.
Problem 14.
(a) Convert the circuit shown in
Figure 36.82(a) to an equivalent Norton network.
(b) Convert the network shown in Figure 36.82(b)
to an equivalent Thévenin circuit.

Part 4
Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems
547
(a)
If the terminals AB of Figure 36.82(a)are short cir-
cuited, the short-circuit current, ISC =20/4=5A.
The impedance‘lookingin’ at terminals AB is 4.
Hence the equivalent Norton network is as shown
in Figure 36.83(a).
Figure 36.83
(b)
The open-circuit voltage E across terminals AB
in Figure 36.82(b) is given by E = (ISC)(z) =
(3)(2)=6V. The impedance ‘looking in’ at ter-
minals AB is 2.
Hence the equivalent Thévenin circuit is as shown
in Figure 36.83(b).
Problem 15.
(a) Convert the circuit to the left of
terminals AB in Figure 36.84 to an equivalent
Thévenin circuit by initially converting to a Norton
equivalent circuit. (b) Determine the magnitude of
the current ﬂowing in the (1.8+j4) impedance
connected between terminals A and B of
Figure 36.84.
Figure 36.84
(a)
For the branch containing the 12V source, con-
version to a Norton equivalent network gives
ISC1 =12/3=4A and z1 =3. For the branch
containing the 24V source, conversion to a Nor-
ton equivalentcircuit gives ISC2 =24/2=12A and
z2 =2.
Thus Figure 36.85 shows a network equivalent
to Figure 36.84. From Figure 36.85, the total
short-circuit current is 4+12=16A, and the
total impedance is given by (3×2)/(3+2)=1.2
Thus Figure 36.85 simpliﬁes to Figure 36.86.

Figure 36.86
The open-circuit voltage across AB of Figure
36.86, E =(16)(1.2)=19.2V, and the impedance

equivalent circuit is as shown in Figure 36.87.
Figure 36.87
(b)
When the (1.8+j4) impedance is connected to
terminals AB of Figure 36.87, the current I ﬂowing
is given by
I =
19.2
(1.2 + 1.8 + j4) = 3.84∠−53.13◦A

impedance is 3.84A

equivalent networks, a Thévenin equivalent circuit
for terminals AB of Figure 36.88. Hence determine

Figure 36.88
For the branch containing the 5V source, converting to
a Norton equivalentnetworkgives ISC =5/1000=5mA
and z=1k.For the branch containingthe 10V source,
converting to a Norton equivalent network gives
ISC =10/4000=2.5mA and z=4k. Thus the circuit
of Figure 36.88 converts to that of Figure 36.89.
Figure 36.89
The
two
Norton
equivalent networks
shown
in
Figure 36.89 may be combined, since the total short-
circuit current is (5+2.5)=7.5mA and the total
impedance z is given by (1×4)/(1+4)=0.8k. This
results in the network of Figure 36.90.
Figure 36.90
Both of the Norton equivalent networks shown in
Figure 36.90 may be converted to Thévenin equivalent
circuits. Open-circuit voltage across CD is
(7.5 × 10−3)(0.8 × 103) = 6V
and the impedance ‘looking in’ at CD is 0.8k. Open-
circuit voltage across EF is (1×10−3)(2×102)=2V
and the impedance ‘looking in’ at EF is 2k. Thus
Figure 36.90 converts to Figure 36.91.
Figure 36.91
Combining the two Thévenin circuits gives e.m.f.
E=6−2=4V, and impedance z=(0.8+2)=2.8k.
Thus the Thévenin equivalent circuit for terminals AB
of Figure 36.88 is as shown in Figure 36.92.

If an impedance (200−j4000) is connected across

impedance z = 0.894∠63.43◦k or

Thus the Thévenin equivalent circuit is as shown

Chapter 37
Delta–star and star–delta
transformations
Why it is important to understand: Delta–star and star–delta transforms
There are many popular circuit conﬁgurations; two such commonly used conﬁgurations are star-
connected networks and delta-connected networks. A star-connected network is also referred to as the T
network. Similarly, the delta-connected network is also referred to as the π network. The star-connected
and delta-connected conﬁgurations are used often and a complex circuit may contain such conﬁgurations
within the circuit. In order to analyse such a complex circuit, it is at times necessary to transform a star-
connected conﬁguration within the circuit to a delta-connected conﬁguration. In some cases, it may be the
other way around. It is often easier to analyse the circuit after such a transformation. This chapter ﬁrstly
explains how to recognize a delta and a star connection and then applies the delta–star and star–delta
transformations to d.c. and a.c. networks through calculations.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
recognize delta (or π) and star (or T ) connections
•
apply the delta–star and star–delta transformations in appropriate a.c. and d.c. networks
37.1 Introduction
By using Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh-current analysis, nodal
analysis or the superpositiontheorem, currents and volt-
ages in many networks can be determined as shown
in Chapters 33 to 35. Thévenin’s and Norton’s theo-
rems, introduced in Chapter 36, provide an alternative
method of solving networks and often with consider-
ably reduced numerical calculations. Also, these latter
theorems are especially useful when only the current
in a particular branch of a complicated network is
required. Delta–star and star–delta transformations may
be applied in certain types of circuit to simplify them
before application of circuit theorems.

37.3 Delta–star transformation
It is possible to replace the delta connection shown in
Figure37.3(a)byanequivalentstarconnectionasshown
in Figure 37.3(b), such that the impedance measured
Figure 37.3
between any pair of terminals (1–2, 2–3 or 3–1) is the
same in star as in delta. The equivalent star network
will consume the same power and operate at the same
power factor as the original delta network. A delta–
star transformation may alternatively be termed ‘π to
T transformation’.
Considering terminals 1 and 2 of Figure 37.3(a), the
equivalent impedance is given by the impedance Z B in
parallel with the series combination of ZA and ZC
i.e.
ZB(ZA + ZC)
ZB + ZA + ZC
In Figure 37.3(b), the equivalent impedance between
terminals 1 and 2 is Z1 and Z2 in series, i.e. Z1 + Z2
Thus,
Delta
Star
Z12 = ZB(ZA + ZC)
ZB + ZA + ZC
= Z1 + Z2
(1)
By similar reasoning,
Z23 = ZC(ZA + ZB)
ZC + ZA + ZB
= Z2 + Z3
(2)
and
Z31 = ZA(ZB + ZC)
ZA + ZB + ZC
= Z3 + Z1
(3)

Part 4

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Hence we have three simultaneous equations to be
solved for Z1, Z2 and Z3
Equation (1) – equation (2) gives:
ZAZB −ZAZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
= Z1 −Z3
(4)
Equation (3)+equation (4) gives:
2ZAZB
ZA + ZB + ZC
= 2Z1
from which
Z1 =
ZAZB
ZA + ZB + ZC
Similarly, equation (2) – equation (3) gives:
ZBZC −ZAZB
ZA + ZB + ZC
= Z2 −Z1
(5)
Equation (1) + equation (5) gives:
2ZBZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
= 2Z2
from which
Z2 =
ZBZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
Finally, equation (3) −equation (1) gives:
ZAZC −ZBZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
= Z3 −Z2
(6)
Equation (2) + equation (6) gives:
2ZAZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
= 2Z3
from which
Z3 =
ZAZC
ZA + ZB + ZC
Summarizing, the star section shown in Figure 37.3(b)
is equivalentto the delta section shown in Figure 37.3(a)
when
Z1=
ZAZB
ZA +ZB +ZC
(7)
Z2=
ZBZC
ZA +ZB +ZC
(8)
and
Z3=
ZAZC
ZA +ZB +ZC
(9)
It is noted that impedance Z1 is given by the prod-
uct of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal
1 (i.e. ZA and ZB), divided by the sum of the three
impedances; impedance Z2 is given by the product
of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal 2
(i.e. ZB and ZC), divided by the sum of the three
impedances; and impedance Z3 is given by the prod-
uct of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal
3 (i.e. ZA and ZC), divided by the sum of the three
impedances.
Thus, for example, the star equivalent of the resistive
delta network shown in Figure 37.4 is given by
Figure 37.4
Z1 =
(2)(3)
2 + 3 + 5 = 0.6
Z2 =

Hence p.d. between C and D (i.e. p.d. across

Chapter 38
Maximum power transfer
theorems and impedance
matching
Why it is important to understand: Maximum power transfer theorems and impedance matching
In electrical engineering, the maximum power transfer theorem states that to obtain maximum external
power from a source with a ﬁnite internal resistance, the resistance of the load must equal the resistance
of the source as viewed from its output terminals. Moritz von Jacobi published the maximum power
(transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as Jacobi’s law. A related concept is reﬂection-less
impedance matching. In radio, transmission lines, and other electronics, there is often a requirement
to match the source impedance (such as a transmitter) to the load impedance (such as an antenna) to
avoid reﬂections in the transmission line. In electronics, impedance matching is the practice of designing
the input impedance of an electrical load (or the output impedance of its corresponding signal source)
to maximize the power transfer or minimize reﬂections from the load. Matching a load to a source for
maximum power transfer is extremely important in microwaves, as well as all manner of lower frequency
applications such as stereo sound systems, electrical generating plants, solar cells and hybrid electric cars.
This chapter explains, with calculations, the maximum power transfer theorems and the importance of
impedance matching.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
appreciate typical applications of the maximum power transfer theorem
•
appreciate the conditions for maximum power transfer in a.c. networks
•
apply the maximum power transfer theorems to a.c. networks
•
appreciate applications and advantages of impedance matching in a.c. networks
•
perform calculations involving matching transformers for impedance matching in a.c. networks

38.1 Maximum power transfer
theorems
As mentioned in Section 15.9 on page 239, the maxi-
mum power transfer theorem has applications in stereo
ampliﬁer design, where it is necessary to maximize
power delivered to speakers, and in electric vehicle
design, where it is necessary to maximize power deliv-
ered to drive a motor.
A network that contains linear impedances and one
or more voltage or current sources can be reduced to
a Thévenin equivalent circuit, as shown in Chapter 36.
When a load is connected to the terminals of this equiv-
alent circuit, power is transferred from the source to the
load.
A Théveninequivalentcircuit is shown in Figure 38.1
with source internal impedance, z=(r +jx) and com-
plex load Z =(R +jX)
Figure 38.1
The maximum power transferred from the source to the
load depends on the following four conditions.
Condition 1. Let the load consist of a pure variable
resistance R (i.e. let X=0). Then current I in the load is
given by:
I =
E
(r + R) + jx
and the magnitude of current, |I|=
E
√[(r + R)2 + x2]
The active power P delivered to load R is given by
P = |I|2R =
E2R
(r + R)2 + x2
To determine the value of R for maximum power
transferred to the load, P is differentiated with respect
to R and then equated to zero (this being the normal
procedure for ﬁnding maximum or minimum values
using calculus). Using the quotient rule of differenti-
ation,
dP
dR = E2
[(r + R)2 + x2](1) −(R)(2)(r + R)
[(r + R)2 + x2]2
 
= 0 for a maximum (or minimum) value.
For dP
dR to be zero, the numerator of the fraction must
be zero.
Hence
(r +R)2 +x2 −2R(r +R)=0
i.e.
r2 +2rR+R2 +x2 −2Rr−2R2 =0
from which, r 2 + x2 = R2
(1)
or
R = √(r2 + x2) = |z|
Thus,withavariablepurelyresistiveload,themaximum
power is delivered to the load if the load resistance R is
made equal to the magnitude of the source impedance.
Condition 2. Let both the load and the source impe-
dance be purely resistive (i.e. let x =X=0). From
equation (1) it may be seen that the maximum power is
transferred when R=r (this is, in fact, the d.c. condition
explained in Chapter 15, page 239)
Condition 3. Let the load Z have both variable resis-
tance R and variable reactance X. From Figure 38.1,
current I =
E
(r + R) + j(x + X) and
|I| =
E
√[(r + R)2 + (x + x)2]
The active power P delivered to the load is given by
P =|I|2R (since power can onlybedissipatedinaresist-
ance) i.e.
P =
E2R
(r + R)2 + (x + x)2
IfX isadjustedsuchthatX=−x thenthevalueofpower
is a maximum.
If X=−x then P =
E2R
(r + R)2
dP
dR = E2
(r + R)2(1) −(R)(2)(r + R)
(r + R)4
 
= 0 for a maximum value

Part 4
Maximum power transfer theorems and impedance matching
567
Hence
(r +R)2 −2R(r +R)=0
i.e.
r2 +2rR +R2 −2Rr −2R2 =0
from which,
r 2 −R2 =0 and R =r
Thus with the load impedance Z consisting of vari-
able resistance R and variable reactance X, maximum
power is delivered to the load when X = −x and R = r
i.e. when R +jX= r −jx. Hence maximum power is
delivered to the load when the load impedance is the
complex conjugate of the source impedance.
Condition 4. Let the load impedance Z have variable
resistance R and ﬁxed reactance X. From Figure 38.1,
the magnitude of current,
|I| =
E
√[(r + R)2 + (x + X)2]
and the power dissipated in the load,
P =
E2R
(r + R)2 + (x + X)2
dP
dR = E2
[(r +R)2 +(x +X)2(1)−(R)(2)(r +R)]
[(r + R)2 + (x + X)2]2
 
= 0 for a maximum value
Hence
(r + R)2 + (x + X)2 −2R(r + R)=0
r2 + 2rR + R2 + (x + X)2 −2Rr −2R2 =0
from which, R2 =r2 +(x +X)2 and
R=√[r2 +(x+X)2)]
Summary
With reference to Figure 38.1:
1.
When the load is purely resistive (i.e. X=0) and
adjustable, maximum power transfer is achieved
when
R=|z|=√(r2 +x2)
2.
When both the load and the source impedance are
purely resistive (i.e. X=x =0), maximum power
transfer is achieved when R=r
3.
When the load resistance R and reactance X are
both independently adjustable, maximum power
transfer is achieved when
X = −x and R = r
4.
When the load resistance R is adjustable with reac-
tance X ﬁxed, maximum power transfer is achieved
when
R = √[r2 + (x + X)2]
The maximum power transfer theorems are primarily
important where a small source of power is involved –
such as, for example, the output from a telephone system
(see Section 38.2)
Problem 1.
For the circuit shown in Figure 38.2
the load impedance Z is a pure resistance.
Determine (a) the value of R for maximum power
to be transferred from the source to the load and
(b) the value of the maximum power delivered to R.
Figure 38.2
(a)
From condition 1, maximum powertransfer occurs
when R =|z|, i.e. when
R = |15 + j20| = √(152 + 202) = 25
(b)
Current I ﬂowing in the load is given by
I =E/ZT , where the total circuit impedance
ZT =z+R =15+j20+25
=(40+j20) or 44.72 ∠26.57◦
Hence
I =
120∠0◦
44.72∠26.57◦= 2.683∠–26.57◦A
Thus maximum power delivered,
P=I 2R
=(2.683)2(25)
=180W
Problem 2.
If the load impedance Z in
Figure 38.2 of Problem 1 consists of variable
resistance R and variable reactance X, determine
(a) the value of Z that results in maximum power
transfer and (b) the value of the maximum power.

From condition 3, maximum powertransfer occurs

(b)

and maximum power transfer in the load,
P =I 2R =(4)2 (15)=240W

and (b) the value of the maximum power

This problem is an example of condition 1, where
maximum power transfer is achieved when R=|z|.

2π(1000)(1×10−6)

(100 −j159.15) =
159.15∠−90◦
187.96∠−57.86◦
= 84.67∠−32.14◦ or (71.69 −j45.04)
Thus the value of load resistance for maximum
power transfer is 84.67 (i.e. |z|)
(b)
With z=(71.69−j45.04) and R =84.67
for maximum power transfer, the total circuit
impedance,
ZT =71.69 + 84.67 −j45.04
=(156.36 −j45.04) or 162.72∠−16.07 ◦
Current ﬂowing in the load, I = V
ZT

162.72∠−16.07◦

Thus the maximum power transferred,
P =I 2R =(1.23)2(84.67)=128W
Problem 4.
In the network shown in Figure 38.4
the load consists of a ﬁxed capacitive reactance of
7 and a variable resistance R. Determine (a) the
value of R for which the power transferred to the
load is a maximum, and (b) the value of the
maximum power.

From condition (4), maximum power transfer is
achieved when
R = √[r2 + (x + X)2] = √[42 + (10 −7)2]

38.2 Impedance matching
It is seen from Section 38.1 that when it is nec-
essary to obtain the maximum possible amount of
power from a source, it is advantageous if the cir-
cuit components can be adjusted to give equality of
impedances. This adjustment is called ‘impedance
matching’ and is an important consideration in elec-
tronic and communications devices which normally
involve small amounts of power. Examples where
matching is important include coupling an aerial to a
transmitter or receiver, or coupling a loudspeaker to
an ampliﬁer. Also, matching a load to a source for
maximum power transfer is extremely important in
microwaves, as well as all manner of lower frequency
applications such as electrical generating plants and
solar cells.
The mains power supply is considered as inﬁnitely
large compared with the demand upon it,and under such
conditions it is unnecessary to consider the conditions
for maximum power transfer. With transmission lines
(see Chapter 47), the lines are ‘matched’ ideally, i.e.
terminated in their characteristic impedance.
With d.c. generators, motors or secondary cells, the
internal impedance is usually very small and in such
cases, if an attempt is made to make the load impedance
as small as the source internal impedance, overloading
of the source results.
A method of achieving maximum power transfer
between a source and a load is to adjust the value of the
load impedance to match the source impedance, which
can be done using a ‘matching-transformer’.

(This is the case introduced in Section 23.10, page 363.)

maximum power transfer.

Complex waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Complex waveforms
Alternating currents and voltages come in very many forms; for example, the electricity power supply,
sound, light, video, radio, all produce signals that alternate – meaning they change their values over time,
alternating above and below a particular value (often, but not always zero). Our bodies also produce
alternating electrical signals, as do all sorts of natural and man-made objects and devices. These signals
are what engineers and technicians are most often interested in when studying electronics, but signals
come in many very different forms. To understand complex signals, there is often a need to simplify
them; if the signal can be understood in its simplest form, then that understanding can be applied to the
complex signal. A complex wave is a wave made up of a series of sine waves; it is therefore more complex
than a single pure sine wave. This series of sine waves always contains a sine wave called the fundamental
which has the same frequency (repetition rate) as the complex wave being created. This chapter explains
harmonic synthesis, uses Fourier series for simple functions, calculates r.m.s., mean values and power
with complex waves, and lists and explains some sources of harmonics.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a complex wave
•
recognize periodic functions
•
recognize the general equation of a complex waveform
•
use harmonic synthesis to build up a complex wave
•
recognize characteristics of waveforms containing odd, even or odd and even harmonics, with or without
phase change
•

•
calculate r.m.s. and mean values, and form factor of a complex wave
•

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
39.1 Introduction
In preceding chapters a.c. supplies have been assumed
to be sinusoidal, this being a form of alternating quan-
tity commonly encountered in electrical engineering.
However, many supply waveforms are not sinusoidal.
For example, sawtooth generators produce ramp wave-
forms, and rectangular waveforms may be produced
by multivibrators. A waveform that is not sinusoidal is
called a complex wave. Such a waveform may be shown
tobecomposedofthesumofaseriesofsinusoidalwaves
having various interrelated periodic times.
A function f (t) is said to be periodic if f (t + T )=f (t)
for all values of t, where T is the interval between two
successive repetitions and is called the period of the
function f (t). A sine wave having a period of 2π/ω is
a familiar example of a periodic function.
A
typical
complex periodic-voltage waveform,
shown in Figure 39.1, has period T seconds and
frequency f hertz. A complex wave such as this can be
resolved into the sum of a number of sinusoidal wave-
forms, and each of the sine waves can have a different
frequency, amplitude and phase.
The initial, major sine wave component has a fre-
quency f equal to the frequency of the complex wave
and this frequency is called the fundamental fre-
quency. The other sine wave components are known as
harmonics, these having frequencies which are integer
multiples of frequency f . Hence the second harmonic
has a frequency of 2f , the third harmonic has a fre-
quency of 3f , and so on. Thus if the fundamental (i.e.
supply) frequency of a complex wave is 50Hz, then the
third harmonic frequency is 150Hz, the fourth harmonic
frequency is 200Hz, and so on.
Figure 39.1 Typical complex periodic voltage waveform
39.2 The general equation
for a complex waveform
The instantaneous value of a complex voltage wave
v acting in a linear circuit may be represented by the
general equation
v = Vm sin(ωt + 1) + V2m sin(2ωt + 2)
+ ··· + Vnm sin(nωt + n)volts
(1)
Here V1m sin(ωt + 
1) represents the fundamental
componentof which V1m is the maximumor peak value,
frequency, f = ω/2π and 
1 is the phase angle with
respect to time, t = 0.
Similarly, V2m sin(2ωt + 
2) represents the second
harmonic component, and Vnm sin(nωt + 
n) repre-
sents the nth harmonic component, of which Vnm is the
peak value, frequency = nω/2π( = nf ) and 
n is the
phase angle.
In the same way, the instantaneous value of a complex
current i may be represented by the general equation
i = I1m sin(ωt + θ1) + I2m sin(2ωt + θ2)
+ ··· + Inm sin(nωt + θn)amperes
(2)
Where equations (1) and (2) refer to the voltage across
and the current ﬂowing through a given linear circuit,
the phase angle between the fundamental voltage and
current is φ1 = (
1 −θ1), the phase angle between the
second harmonic voltage and current is φ2 = (
2 −θ2),
and so on.
It often occurs that not all harmonic components are
present in a complex waveform. Sometimes only the
fundamental and odd harmonics are present, and in
others only the fundamental and even harmonics are
present.

39.3 Harmonic synthesis
Harmonic analysis is the process of resolving a
complex periodic waveform into a series of sinusoidal
components of ascending order of frequency. Many of

Part 4

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
the waveforms met in practice can be represented by
mathematical expressions similar to those of equations
(1) and (2), and the magnitudeof their harmoniccompo-
nents together with their phase may be calculated using
Fourier series (see Section 39.4 and Section 39.5).
Numerical methods are used to analyse waveforms
for which simple mathematical expressions cannot be
obtained. A numerical method of harmonic analysis
is explained in Chapter 40. In a laboratory, waveform
analysis may be performed using a waveform analyser
which produces a direct readout of the component
waves present in a complex wave.
By adding the instantaneous values of the fundamen-
tal and progressive harmonics of a complex wave for
given instants in time, the shape of a complex waveform
can be gradually built up. This graphical procedure is
known as harmonic synthesis (synthesis meaning ‘the
putting together of parts or elements so as to make up
a complex whole’).
A number of examples of harmonic synthesis will
now be considered.
Example 1
Consider the complex voltage expression given by
va = 100sinωt + 30sin3ωt volts
The waveform is made up of a fundamental wave of
maximum value 100V and frequency, f = ω/2π hertz
and a third harmonic component of maximum value
30V and frequency = 3ω/2π( = 3f ), the fundamental
and third harmonics being initially in phase with each
other. Since the maximum value of the third harmonic is
30V and that of the fundamental is 100V, the resultant
waveform va is said to contain 30/100, i.e. ‘30% third
harmonic’. In Figure 39.2, the fundamental waveform
is shown by the broken line plotted over one cycle, the
periodic time being 2π/ω seconds. On the same axis is
plotted 30sin3ωt, shown by the dotted line, having a
maximum value of 30V and for which three cycles are
completed in time T seconds. At zero time, 30sin3ωt
is in phase with 100sinωt.
The fundamental and third harmonic are combined by
adding ordinates at intervals to produce the waveform
for va as shown. For example, at time T/12 seconds,
the fundamental has a value of 50V and the third har-
monic a value of 30V. Adding gives a value of 80V for
waveform va, at time T/12 seconds. Similarly, at time
T/4 seconds, the fundamental has a value of 100V and
the third harmonic a value of −30V. After addition, the
resultant waveform va is 70V at time T/4. The proce-
dure is continued between t = 0 and t = T to produce
the complex waveform for va. The negative half-cycle
Figure 39.2
of waveform va is seen to be identical in shape to the
positive half-cycle.
Example 2
Consider the addition of a ﬁfth harmonic component to
the complex waveformof Figure 39.2, giving a resultant
waveform expression
vb = 100sinωt + 30sin3ωt + 20sin5ωt volts
Figure 39.3 shows the effect of adding (100sinωt +
30sin3ωt) obtained from Figure 39.2 to 20sin5ωt.
The shapes of the negative and positive half-cycles are
still identical. If further odd harmonics of the appro-
priate amplitude and phase were added to vb, a good
approximation to a square wave would result.

This expression is similar to voltage va in that the
peak value of the fundamental and third harmonic are
the same. However, the third harmonic has a phase dis-
placement of π/2 radian leading (i.e. leading 30sin3ωt
by π/2 radian). Note that, since the periodic time of the
fundamental is T seconds, the periodic time of the third
harmonic is T/3 seconds, and a phase displacement of
π/2 radian or 1
4 cycle of the third harmonic represents a
time interval of (T/3)÷4, i.e. T/12 seconds.

and

are added at intervals, the resultant waveform vc
is as shown. The shape of the waveform vc is
quite different from that of waveform va shown in
Figure 39.2, even though the percentage third har-
monic is the same. If the negative half-cycle in
Figure 39.4 is reversed it can be seen that the shape
of the positive and negative half-cycles are identical.

General conclusions on examples 1 to 6
Whenever odd harmonics are added to a fundamental
waveform, whether initially in phase with each other or
not, the positive and negativehalf-cycles of the resultant
complex wave are identical in shape (i.e. in Figures 39.2
to 39.6, the values of voltage in the third quadrant –
between T/2 seconds and 3T/4 seconds – are identical
to the voltage values in the ﬁrst quadrant – between
0 and T/4 seconds, except that they are negative, and
the values of voltage in the second and fourth quad-
rants are identical, except for the sign change. This is a
feature of waveforms containing a fundamental and odd
harmonics and is true whether harmonics are added or
subtracted from the fundamental.
From Figures 39.2 to 39.6, it is seen that a waveform
can change its shape considerably as a result of changes
in both phase and magnitude of the harmonics.
Example 7
Consider the complex current expression given by
ia = 10sinωt + 4sin2ωt amperes
Current ia consists of a fundamental component,
10sinωt, and a second harmonic component, 4sin2ωt,
the components being initially in phase with each
other. Current ia contains 40% second harmonic. The
fundamental and second harmonic are shown plotted
separately in Figure 39.8. By adding ordinates at inter-
vals, the complex waveform representing ia is produced
as shown. It is noted that if all the values in the nega-
tive half-cycle were reversed then this half-cycle would
appear as a mirror image of the positive half-cycle about
a vertical line drawn through time t = T /2

Consider the complex current expression given by
ib = 10sinωt + 4sin2ωt + 3sin4ωt amperes
The waveforms representing (10sinωt + 4sin2ωt) and
the fourth harmonic component, 3sin4ωt, are each
shown separately in Figure 39.9, the former wave-
form having been produced in Figure 39.8. By adding
ordinates at intervals, the complex waveform for i b is
produced as shown in Figure 39.9. If the half-cycle
between times T/2 and T is reversed then it is seen to
be a mirror image of the half-cycle lying between 0 and

the negative half-cycle is reversed, it is seen to be a
mirror image of the positive half-cycle about a line
drawn vertically through time t = T /2

General conclusions on examples 7 to 10
Whenever even harmonics are added to a fundamental
component:
(a)
if the harmonics are initially in phase or if there
is a phase shift of π rad, the negative half-cycle,
when reversed, is a mirror image of the positive
half-cycle about a vertical line drawn through time
t = T /2;
(b)
if the harmonics are initially out of phase with
each other (i.e. other than π rad), the positive and
negative half-cycles are dissimilar.
These are features of waveforms containing the funda-
mental and even harmonics.

The current i comprises three components – a 32mA
d.c. component, a fundamental of amplitude 50mA
and a second harmonic of amplitude 20mA, lag-

monic are shown separately in Figure 39.14. Adding
ordinates at intervals gives the complex waveform
50sinωt + 20sin(2ωt −π/2)
This waveform is then added to the 32mA d.c.
component to produce the waveform i as shown.
The effect of the d.c. component is seen to be to
shift the whole wave 32mA upward. The waveform
approaches that expected from a half-wave rectiﬁer

A complex waveform v comprises a
fundamental voltage of 240V r.m.s. and frequency
50Hz, together with a 20% third harmonic which
has a phase angle lagging by 3π/4rad at time = 0
(a) Write down an expression to represent voltage
v. (b) Use harmonic synthesis to sketch the
complex waveform representing voltage v over one
cycle of the fundamental component.
(a)
A fundamental voltage having an r.m.s. value of
240V has a maximum value, or amplitude, of
(√2)(240), i.e. 339.4V
If the fundamental frequency is 50Hz then ang-
ular velocity, ω = 2πf = 2π(50) = 100π rad/s.
Hence the fundamental voltage is represented by
339.4sin100πt volts. Since the fundamental fre-
quencyis50Hz,thetimeforonecycleofthefunda-
mental is given by T = 1/f =1/50s or 20ms.
The third harmonic has an amplitude equal to
20% of 339.4V, i.e. 67.9V. The frequency of the
thirdharmoniccomponentis3×50 = 150Hz,thus
the angular velocity is 2π (150), i.e. 300π rad/s.
Hence the third harmonicvoltage is representedby
67.9sin(300πt −3π/4) volts. Thus

In Figure 39.16(b) the negative half-cycle is quite

Periodic functions
As stated earlier in this chapter, a function f (x) is said
to be periodic if f (x + T ) = f (x) for all values of
x, where T is some positive number. T is the inter-
val between two successive repetitions and is called the
period of the functions f (x).
For example, y = sinx is periodic in x with period 2π
since sinx = sin(x + 2π) = sin(x + 4π), and so on. In
general, if y = sinωt then the period of the waveform
∗Who was Fourier? Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (21 March
1768–16 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist
best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier series and
their applications to problems of heat transfer and vibrations.

periodic of period 2π and is deﬁned by:
f (x) =
−1, when −π < x < 0
1, when
0 < x < π
If a graphof a functionhas no sudden jumps or breaks
it is called a continuous function, examples being the
graphs of sine and cosine functions. However, other
graphs make ﬁnite jumps at a point or points in the inter-
val. The square wave shown in Figure 39.18 has ﬁnite
discontinuities at x = π, 2π, 3π, and so on. A great
advantage of Fourier series over other series is that it
can be applied to functions which are discontinuous as
well as those which are continuous.
The basis of a Fourier series is that all functions of
practical signiﬁcance which are deﬁned in the interval
−π ≤x ≤π can be expressed in terms of a convergent
trigonometric series of the form:
f (x) = a0 + a1cosx + a2cos2x + a3cos3x + ···

For an exact representation of a complex wave, an
inﬁnite number of terms are, in general, required. In
many practical cases, however, it is sufﬁcient to take
the ﬁrst few terms only. Obtaining a Fourier series for

Graphs of P1, P2 and P3, obtained by drawing up
tables of values, and adding waveforms, are shown in
Figures 39.20(a) to (c) and they show that the series
is convergent, i.e. continually approximating towards a
deﬁnite limit as more and more partial sums are taken,
and in the limit will have the sum f (x) = π
Even with just three partial sums, the waveform is
starting to approach the rectangular wave the Fourier
series is representing.
Expansion of non-periodic functions
If a function f (x) is not periodic then it cannot be
expandedinaFourierseriesforall valuesofx.However,
it is possible to determine a Fourier series to represent
the function over any range of width 2π
Given a non-periodic function, a new function may
be constructed by taking the values of f (x) in the
given range and then repeating them outside of the
given range at intervals of 2π. Since this new func-
tion is, by construction, periodic with period 2π, it
may then be expanded in a Fourier series for all
values of x. For example, the function f (x) = x is
not a periodic function. However, if a Fourier series
for f (x) = x is required then the function is con-
structed outside of this range so that it is periodic
with period 2π as shown by the broken lines in
Figure 39.21.
For non-periodic functions, such as f (x) = x, the sum
of the Fourier series is equal to f (x) at all points in the
given range but it is not equal to f (x) at points outside
of the range.

39.6 R.m.s. value, mean value and the
form factor of a complex wave
R.m.s. value
Let the instantaneous value of a complex current, i, be
given by
i = I1m sin(ωt + θ1) + I2m sin(2ωt + θ2)
+ ··· + Inm sin(nωt + θn)amperes
The effective or r.m.s. value of this current is given by
I = √(mean value of i2)
i2 = [I1m sin(ωt + θ1) + I2m sin(2ωt + θ2)
+ ··· + Inm sin(nωt + θn)]2
i.e. i2 = I 2

+ ··· + I 2
nm sin2(nωt + θn)
+ 2I1mI2m sin(ωt + θ1)sin(2ωt + θ2) + ···
(16)
Without writing down all terms involved when squaring
current i, it can be seen that two types of term result,
these being:
(i)
terms such as I 2
1msin2(ωt+θ1), I 2
2msin2(2ωt+θ2),
and so on, and
(ii)
terms such as 2I1mI2m sin(ωt + θ1)sin(2ωt + θ2),
i.e. products of different harmonics.
The mean value of i 2 is the sum of the mean values of
each term in equation (16).
Taking an example of the ﬁrst type,sayI 2
1msin2(ωt+θ1),
the mean value over one cycle of the fundamental
is determined using integral calculus:

For a sine wave, r.m.s. value = (1/√2) maximum value,
i.e. maximum value = √2 r.m.s. value. Hence, for
example, I1m = √2I1, where I1 is the r.m.s. value of the
fundamental component, and (I1m)2 = (√2I1)2 = 2I 2

phase angles of the harmonic components. For a d.c.

A complex voltage waveform which
has an r.m.s. value of 240V contains 30% third
harmonic and 10% ﬁfth harmonic, both of the
harmonics being initially in phase with each other.
(a) Determine the r.m.s. value of the fundamental
and each harmonic. (b) Write down an expression
to represent the complex voltage waveform if the
frequency of the fundamental is 31.83Hz.
(a)
From equation (21), r.m.s. voltage
V = √(v2
1 + V 2
3 + V 2
5 )
Since
V3 = 0.30V1,V5 = 0.10V1 and
V = 240V, then
240 = √[V 2
1 + (0.30V1)2 + (0.10V1)2]
i.e.
240 = √(1.10V 2
1 ) = 1.049V1
from which the r.m.s. value of the fundamental,
V1 = 240/1.049 = 228.8V
R.m.s. value of the third harmonic,
V3 = 0.30 V1 = (0.30)(228.8) = 68.64V
and the r.m.s. value of the ﬁfth harmonic,
V5 = 0.10V1 = (0.10)(228.8) = 22.88V
(b)
Maximum value of the fundamental,
V1m = √2V1 = √2(228.8) = 323.6V
Maximum value of the third harmonic,
V3m = √2V3 = √2(68.64) = 97.07V
Maximum value of the ﬁfth harmonic,
V5m = √2V5 = √2(22.88) = 32.36V
Since the fundamental frequency is 31.83Hz, the
fundamental
voltage
may
be
written
as
323.6 sin2π(31.83)t, i.e. 323.6sin200t volts.
The third harmonic component is 97.07 sin 600t
volts and the ﬁfth harmonic component is
32.36sin1000t volts. Hence an expression repre-
senting the complex voltage waveform is given by
v = (323.6sin200t + 97.07sin600t

39.7 Power associated with complex
waves
Let a complex voltage wave be represented by
v = V1m sinωt + V2m sin2ωt + V3msin3ωt + ··· ,
and when this is applied to a circuit let the resulting
current be represented by
i = I1m sin(ωt −φ1) + I2m sin(2ωt −φ2)
+I3m sin(3ωt −φ3) + ···
(Since the phase angles are lagging, the circuit in this
case is inductive.) At any instant in time the power p
supplied to the circuit is given by p = vi, i.e.
p = (V1m sinωt + V2msin2ωt + ···)(I1m sin(ωt −φ1)
+ I2m sin(2ωt −φ2) + ···)
= V1mI1m sinωt sin(ωt −φ1)
+ V1mI2m sinωt sin(2ωt −φ2) + ···
(26)
The average or active power supplied over one cycle is
given by the sum of the average values of each individ-
ual product term taken over one cycle. It is seen from
equation (17) that the average value of product terms
involving harmonics of different frequencies is always
zero. This means therefore that only products of voltage
and current harmonics of the same frequency need be
considered in equation (26).
Taking the ﬁrst term, for example, the average power

i.e.
P1 = V1I1 cosφ1 watts
Similarly, the average power supplied over one cycle
of the fundamental for the second harmonic is
V2I2 cos 2, and so on. Hence the total power sup-
plied by complex voltages and currents is the sum of
the powers supplied by each harmonic component act-
ing on its own. The average power P supplied for one
cycle of the fundamental is given by
P = V1I1 cosφ1 + V2I2 cosφ2 + ··· + VnIn cosφn
(27)
If the voltage waveform contains a d.c. component V 0
which causes a direct current component I0, then the
average power supplied by the d.c. component is V 0I0
and the total average power P supplied is given by
P = V0I0 +V1I1cosφ1 +V2I2cosφ2 +···+ VnIncosφn
(28)
Alternatively, if R is the equivalent series resistance of
a circuit then the total power is given by

Thus power factor depends upon the value of phase
angle φ, and is lagging for an inductive circuit and
leading for a capacitive circuit. However, with a com-
plex waveform, power factor is not given by cos φ. In
the expression for power in equation (27), there are n
phase-angle terms, φ1, φ2,…, φn, all of which may be
different. It is for this reason that it is not possible to state
whether the overall power factor is lagging or leading
when harmonics are present.)

circuits
When a complex alternating voltage wave, i.e. one con-
taining harmonics, is applied to a single-phase circuit
containing resistance, inductance and/or capacitance
(i.e. linear circuit elements), then the resulting current
will also be complex and contain harmonics.
Let a complex voltage v be represented by

Pure resistance
The impedance of a pure resistance R is independent of
frequency and the current and voltage are in phase for

The percentage harmonic content in the current wave
is the same as that in the voltage wave. For exam-
ple, the percentage second harmonic content from

waveforms will therefore be identical in shape.
(b)
Pure inductance
The impedance of a pure inductance L, i.e. inductive
reactance XL(=2πfL), varies with the harmonic fre-
quency when voltage v is applied to it. Also, for every
harmonic term, the current will lag the voltage by 90 ◦
or π/2rad. The current i is given by
i = v

(32)
since for the nth harmonic the reactance is nωL.
Equation (32) shows that for, say, the nth harmonic, the
percentage harmonic content in the current waveform is
only 1/n of the corresponding harmonic content in the
voltage waveform.
If a complex current contains a d.c. component then the
direct voltage drop across a pure inductance is zero.
(c)
Pure capacitance
The impedance of a pure capacitance C, i.e. capacitive
reactance XC(=1/(2πfC)), varies with the harmonic
frequency when voltage v is applied to it. Also, for each
harmonic term the current will lead the voltage by 90 ◦
or π/2rad. The current i is given by

Equation (33) shows that the percentage harmonic con-
tent of the current waveform is n times larger for the
nth harmonic than that of the corresponding harmonic
voltage.
If a complex current contains a d.c. component then
none of this direct current will ﬂow through a pure
capacitor, although the alternating components of the
supply still operate.

A supply voltage v given by
v = (240sin314t + 40sin942t + 30sin1570t) volts
is applied to a circuit comprising a resistance of
12 connected in series with a coil of inductance
9.55mH. Determine (a) an expression to represent
the instantaneous value of the current, (b) the r.m.s.
voltage, (c) the r.m.s. current, (d) the power
dissipated and (e) the overall power factor.
(a)
The supply voltage comprises a fundamental,
240sin314t, a third harmonic, 40sin942t (third
harmonic since 942 is 3×314) and a ﬁfth har-
monic, 30sin1570t
Fundamental
Since the fundamental frequency, ω1 = 314rad/s,
inductive reactance,
XL1 = ω1L = (314)(9.55 × 10−3) = 3.0
Hence impedance at the fundamental frequency,
Z1 = (12 + j3.0) = 12.37∠14.04◦
Maximum current at fundamental frequency
I1m = V1m
Z1
=
240∠0◦
12.37∠14.04◦
= 19.40∠−14.04◦A
14.04◦= 14.04×(π/180)rad=0.245rad,
thus
I1m = 19.40∠−0.245A
Hence the fundamental current
i1 = 19.40sin(314t −0.245)A
(Note that with an expression of the form
R sin(ωt ±α), ωt is an angle measured in radi-
ans, thus the phase displacement, α, should also
be expressed in radians.)
Third harmonic
Since the third harmonic frequency,
ω3 = 942rad/s, inductive reactance,
XL3 = 3XL1 = 9.0

Part 4

601
Hence impedance at the third harmonic frequency,

Z3

40∠0◦
15∠36.87◦

Hence the third harmonic current,
i3 = 2.67 sin(942t −0.644)A
Fifth harmonic
Inductive reactance, XL5 = 5XL1 = 15
Impedance
Z5 = (12 + j15) = 19.21∠51.34◦
Current, I5m = V5m
Z5

19.21∠51.34◦
= 1.56∠−51.34◦A = 1.56∠−0.896A
Hence the ﬁfth harmonic current,
i5 = 1.56sin(1570t −0.896)A
Thus an expression to represent the instantaneous
current, i, is given by i = i1 + i3 + i5 i.e.
i=19.40sin(314t−0.245)
+ 2.67sin(942t−0.644)

39.10 Resonance due to harmonics
In industrial circuits at power frequencies the typical
values of L and C involved make resonance at the fun-
damental frequency very unlikely. (An exception to this
is with the capacitor-start induction motor where the
start-winding can achieve unity power factor during
run-up.)
However, if the voltage waveform is not a pure sine
wave it is quite possible for the resonant frequency to be
near the frequency of one of the harmonics. In this case
the magnitude of the particular harmonic in the current
waveform is greatly increased and may even exceed that
of the fundamental. The effect of this is a great distortion
of the resultant current waveform so that dangerous volt
drops may occur across the inductance and capacitance
in the circuit.
When a circuit resonates at one of the harmonic fre-
quencies of the supply voltage, the effect is called selec-
tive or harmonic resonance.
For resonance with the fundamental, the condition is
ωL = 1/(ωC); for resonance at, say, the third harmonic,
the condition is 3ωL = 1/(3ωC); for resonance at the
nth harmonic, the condition is
nωL = 1/(nωC)

nth harmonic has an amplitude 1.5% of the
fundamental. The voltage is applied to a series

occurs at the nth harmonic. Determine (a) the value

39.11 Sources of harmonics
(i)
Harmonics may be produced in the output wave-
form of an a.c. generator. This may be due
either to ‘tooth-ripple’, caused by the effect of
the slots that accommodate the windings, or to
the non-sinusoidal airgap ﬂux distribution.
Great care is taken to ensure a sinusoidal output
from generators in large supplysystems; however,
non-linear loads will cause harmonics to appear
in the load current waveform. Thus harmonics
are produced in devices that have a non-linear
response to their inputs. Non-linear circuit ele-
ments (i.e. those in which the current ﬂowing
through them is not proportional to the applied
voltage) include rectiﬁers and any large-signal
electronic ampliﬁer in which diodes, transistors,
valves or iron-cored inductors are used.
(ii)
A rectiﬁer is a device for converting an alternat-
ing or an oscillating current into a unidirectional
or approximate direct current. A rectiﬁer has a
low impedance to current ﬂow in one direction
and a nearly inﬁnite impedance to current ﬂow
in the opposite direction. Thus, when an alternat-
ing current is applied to a rectiﬁer, current will
ﬂow through it during the positive half-cycles
only; the current is zero during the negative half-
cycles. A typical current waveform is shown in
Figure39.31.This‘half-waverectiﬁcation’ispro-
duced by using a single diode. The waveform is
similar in shape to that shown in Figure 39.14,
page 582, where the d.c. component brought the
negative half-cycle up to the zero current point.
The waveform shown in Figure 39.31 is typical
of one containing a fairly large second harmonic.
(iii)
Transistors and valves are non-linear devices
in that sinusoidal input results in different posi-
tive and negative half-cycle ampliﬁcations. This
means that the output half cycles have dif-
ferent amplitudes. Since they have a different
shape, even harmonic distortion is suggested (see
Section 39.3).
Figure 39.31 Typical current waveform containing a fairly
large second harmonic
(iv)
Ferromagnetic-cored coils are a source of har-
monic generation in a.c. circuits because of the
non-linearity of the B/H curve and the hystere-
sis loop, especially if saturation occurs. Let a
sinusoidal voltage v = Vm sinωt be applied to a
ferromagnetic-cored coil (having low resistance
relative to inductive reactance) of cross-section
area A square metres and possessing N turns.
If φ is the ﬂux produced in the core then the
instantaneous voltage is given by v =N(dφ/dt).

If B is the ﬂux density of the core, then, since

since area A is a constant for a particular core.

ωNA cosωt
Since −cos ωt = sin(ωt −90◦)
B = Vm
ωNA sin(ωt −90◦)
(34)
Equation (34) shows that if the applied voltage
is sinusoidal, the ﬂux density B in the iron core
must also be sinusoidal but lagging by 90◦.
The condition of low resistance relative to induc-
tive reactance, giving a sinusoidal ﬂux from a
sinusoidal supply voltage, is called free magne-
tization.
Consider the application of a sinusoidal voltage
to a coil wound on a core with a hysteresis loop,
as shown in Figure 39.32(a). The horizontal axis
of a hysteresis loop is magnetic ﬁeld strength
H, but since H = Ni/l and N and l (the length
of the ﬂux path) are constant, the axis may
be directly scaled as current i (i.e. i = Hl/N).
Figure 39.32(b) shows sinusoidal voltage v and
ﬂux density B waveforms, B lagging v by 90◦.
The current waveform is shown in Figure
39.32(c) and is derived as follows. At time t1,
point a on the voltage curve corresponds to point
b on the ﬂux density curve and point c on the
hysteresis loop. The current at time t1 is given by
the distance dc. Plotting this current on a vertical
time-scale gives the derived point e on the current
curve. A similar procedure is adopted for times
t2, t3 and so on over one cycle of the voltage.
(Note that it is important to move around
the hysteresis loop in the correct direction.) It
is seen from the current curve that it is non-
sinusoidal and that the positive and negative

Part 4

half-cycles are identical. This indicates that the
waveform contains only odd harmonics (see
Section 39.3).
(v)
If, in a circuit containing a ferromagnetic-cored
coil, the resistance is high compared with the
inductivereactance, then the current ﬂowing from
a sinusoidal supply will tend to be sinusoidal.
This means that the ﬂux density B of the core
cannot be sinusoidal since it is related to the cur-
rent by the hysteresis loop. This means, in turn,
that the induced voltage due to the alternating
ﬂux (i.e. v = NA(dB/dt)) will not be sinusoidal.
This condition is called forced magnetization.
The shape of the induced voltage waveform
under forced magnetization is obtained as fol-
lows. The current waveform is shown on a
vertical axis in Figure 39.33(a). The hysteresis
loop corresponding to the maximum value of cir-
cuit current is drawn as shown in Figure 39.33(b).
The ﬂux density curve which is derived from
the sinusoidal current waveform is shown in
Figure 39.33(c). Point a on the current wave at
time t1 corresponds to point b on the hysteresis
loop and to point c on the ﬂux density curve. By
taking other points throughout the current cycle
the ﬂux density curve is derived as shown.
The relationship between the induced voltage v
and the ﬂux density B is given by v = NA(dB/dt).
Here dB/dt represents the rate of change of ﬂux
density with respect to time, i.e. the gradient of the
B/t curve. At point d the gradient of the B/t curve
is a maximum in the positive direction. Thus v
will be maximum positive as shown by point d ′
in Figure 39.33(d). At point e the gradient (i.e.
dB/dt) is zero, thus v is zero, as shown by point e ′.
At point f the gradient is maximum in a negative
direction, thus v is maximum negative, as shown
by point f ′. If all such points are taken around the
B/t curve, the curve representing induced volt-
age, shown in Figure 39.33(d), is produced. The
resulting voltage waveform is non-sinusoidal.
The positive and negative half cycles are iden-
tical in shape, indicating that the waveform

contains a fundamental and a prominent third
harmonic.
(vi)
The amount of power delivered to a load can
be controlled using a thyristor, which is a
semiconductor device. Examples of applications
of controlled rectiﬁcation include lamp and heater
controls and the control of motor speeds. A basic
circuit used for single-phase power control is
shown in Figure 39.34(a). The trigger module
contains circuitry to produce the necessary gate
current to turn the thyristor on. If the pulse is
applied at time θ/ω, where θ is the ﬁring or
triggering angle, then the current ﬂowing in the
load resistor has a waveform as shown in
Figure 39.34(b). The sharp rise-time (shown
as ab in Figure 39.34(b)), however, gives rise to
harmonics.
(vii)
In microelectronic systems rectangular wave-
forms are common. Again, fast rise-times give
rise to harmonics, especially at high frequency.
These harmonics can be fed back to the mains if
not ﬁltered.
There are thus a large number of sources of
harmonics.

A numerical method
of harmonic analysis
Why it is important to understand: Harmonic analysis
Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the representation of functions or signals
as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalization of the notions of Fourier series
and Fourier transforms. In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas
as diverse as signal processing, quantum mechanics and neuroscience. This chapter explains a tabular
method of harmonic analysis and explains how to predict the probable harmonic content of a waveform
on inspection.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
use a tabular method to determine the Fourier series for a complex waveform
•
predict the probable harmonic content of a waveform on inspection
40.1 Introduction
Manypractical waveformscan be representedby simple
mathematical expressions, and, by using Fourier series,
the magnitude of their harmonic components deter-
mined.For waveformsnot in this category,analysis may
be achieved by numerical methods. Harmonic analy-
sis is the process of resolving a periodic, non-sinusoidal
quantity into a series of sinusoidal components of
ascending order of frequency.

However, irregular waveforms are not usually deﬁned
by mathematical expressions and thus the Fourier coef-
ﬁcients cannot be determinedby using calculus. In these
cases, approximate methods, such as the trapezoidal
rule, can be used to evaluate the Fourier coefﬁcients.
Most practical waveforms to be analysedare periodic.
Let the period of a waveform be 2π and be divided into
p equal parts as shown in Figure 40.1. The width of
each interval is thus 2π/p. Let the ordinates be labelled
y0,y1,y2,...,yp (note that y0 =yp). The trapezoidal

+ 4.91sin2θ + 9.17sin3θ + ···

Note that in equation (4), (−46.42sinθ +69.66cosθ)
comprises the fundamental, (4.91sin2θ −6.50cos2θ)
comprises
the
second
harmonic,
(9.17sin3θ −
8.17cos3θ) comprises the third harmonic.
It is shown in Higher Engineering Mathematics that
a sinωt + bcosωt ≡R sin(ωt + α)
where a =R cosα,b=R sinα,R =√(a2 +b2) and
α =tan−1 b
a
For the fundamental, R = √[(−46.42)2+(69.66)2]
=83.71
If a =R cosα, then cosα = a
R = −46.42
83.71 , which is
negative,
and if b=R sinα, then sinα = b
R = 69.66
83.71, which is
positive.
The only quadrant where cosα is negative and sinα is
positive is the second quadrant.
Hence
α = tan−1 b
a = tan−1 69.66
−46.42 =123.68◦or 2.16 rad
Thus (−46.42 sinθ +69.66cosθ)=83.71sin(θ +2.16)
By a similar method it may be shown that the second
harmonic
(4.91sin2θ −6.50cos2θ)≡8.15sin(2θ −0.92)
and the third harmonic
(9.17sin3θ −8.17cos3θ)≡12.28sin(3θ −0.73)
Hence equation (4) may be re-written as:
ν = 17.67+ 83.71sin(θ + 2.16)+ 8.15sin(2θ −0.92)
+ 12.28sin(3θ −0.73)volts
which is the form used in Chapter 39 with complex

It is sometimes possible to predict the harmonic con-
tent of a waveform on inspection of particularwaveform
characteristics.
(i)
If a periodic waveform is such that the area above
the horizontal axis is equal to the area below
then the mean value is zero. Hence a0 =0 (see
Figure 40.3(a)).
(ii)
An even function is symmetrical about the
vertical axis and contains no sine terms (see
Figure 40.3(b)).

f (x)=f (x +π) represents a waveform which
repeats after half a cycle and only even harmon-
ics are present (see Figure 40.3(d)).

which the positive and negative cycles are identi-
cal in shape and only odd harmonics are present
(see Figure 40.3(e)).

Figure 40.4
(a)
The waveform shown in Figure 40.4(a) is sym-
metrical about the origin and is thus an odd fun-
ction. An odd function contains no cosine terms.
Also,
the
waveform
has
the
characteristic
f (x) = −f (x +π), i.e. the positive and negative
half-cycles are identical in shape. Only odd har-
monics can be present in such a waveform. Thus
the waveform shown in Figure 40.4(a) contains
only odd sine terms. Since the area above the
x-axis is equal to the area below, a0 =0
(b)
The waveformshown in Figure 40.4(b)is symmet-
rical about the f (x) axis and is thus an even
function. An even function contains no sine
terms. Also, the waveform has the characteristic
f (x)=f (x +π), i.e. the waveform repeats itself
after half a cycle. Only even harmonics can be
present in such a waveform. Thus the waveform
shown in Figure 40.4(b)contains only even cosine
terms (together with a constant term, a0)

Problem 3.
An alternating current i amperes is
shown in Figure 40.5. Analyse the waveform into
its constituent harmonics as far as and including the
ﬁfth harmonic, correct to 2 decimal places, by
taking 30◦intervals.
With reference to Figure 40.5, the following character-
istics are noted:
(i)
The mean value is zero since the area above the θ
axis is equal to the area below it. Thus the constant
term, or d.c. component, a0=0
(ii)
Since the waveform is symmetrical about the
origin the function i is odd, which means that
there are no cosine terms present in the Fourier
series.
(iii)
The waveform is of the form f (θ)=−f (θ +π)
which means that only odd harmonics are present.
Investigating waveform characteristics has thus saved
unnecessary calculations and in this case the Fourier
series has only odd sine terms present, i.e.
i = b1sinθ + b3sin3θ + b5sin5θ + ···
A proforma, similar to Table 40.1, but without the
‘cosine terms’ columns and without the ‘even sine
terms’ columns is shown in Table 40.2 up to, and

Magnetic materials
Why it is important to understand: Magnetic materials
Magnetism, the phenomenon by which materials assert an attractive or repulsive force or inﬂuence
on other materials, has been known for thousands of years. However, the underlying principles and
mechanisms that explain the magnetic phenomenon are complex and subtle, and their understanding has
eludedscientistsuntilrelativelyrecenttimes.Manyofourmoderntechnologicaldevicesrelyonmagnetism
and magnetic materials; these include electrical power generators and transformers, electric motors,
radio, television, telephones, computers and components of sound and video reproduction systems. Iron,
some steels and the naturally occurring mineral lodestone are well-known examples of materials that
exhibit magnetic properties. Not so familiar, however, is the fact that all substances are inﬂuenced to one
degree or another by the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Permanent magnet materials are incorporated in
a device for only one reason, to increase magnetic ﬂux. The ﬂux may be necessary for detection, as it is in
sensors, to assist in creating a force or torque, as it does in motors, actuators and speakers, to generate a
voltage as it does in generators and alternators, to create a magnetic ﬁeld as it does in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) systems and electron beam devices. This chapter provides a brief description of terms
associated with magnetic ﬁelds and brieﬂy looks at the phenomena of diamagnetism, paramagnetism and
ferromagnetism, explains hysteresis and eddy current losses and distinguishes between non-permanent
and permanent magnetic materials.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
recognize terms associated with magnetic circuits
•
appreciate magnetic properties of materials
•
categorize materials as ferromagnetic, diamagnetic and paramagnetic
•
explain hysteresis and calculate hysteresis loss
•
explain and calculate eddy current loss
•
explain a method of separation of hysteresis and eddy current loss and determine the separate losses from
given data
•
distinguish between non-permanent and permanent magnetic materials.

41.1 Revision of terms and units used
with magnetic circuits
In Chapter 9, page 125, a number of terms used with
magnetic circuits are deﬁned. These are summarized
below.
(a)
A magnetic ﬁeld is the state of the space in
the vicinity of a permanent magnet or an elec-
tric current throughout which the magnetic forces
produced by the magnet or current are discernible.
(b)
Magnetic ﬂux 
 is the amount of magnetic ﬁeld
produced by a magnetic source. The unit of mag-
netic ﬂux is the weber∗. If the ﬂux linking one turn
in a circuit changes by one weber in one second, a
voltage of one volt will be induced in that turn.
(c)
Magnetic ﬂux density B is the amount of ﬂux
passingthroughadeﬁnedareathatisperpendicular
to the direction of the ﬂux.
Magnetic ﬂux density = magnetic ﬂux
area
i.e. B = 
/A where A is the area in square
metres. The unit of magnetic ﬂux density is the
tesla∗, T, where 1 T =1Wb/m2.
(d)
Magnetomotive force (mmf) is the cause of
the existence of a magnetic ﬂux in a magnetic
circuit.
mmf, Fm =NI amperes
where N is the number of conductors (or turns)
and I is the current in amperes. The unit of mmf is
sometimes expressed as ‘ampere-turns’.However,
since ‘turns’ have no dimension, the S.I. unit of
mmf is the ampere.
(e)
Magnetic ﬁeld strength (or magnetizing force),
H =NI/l ampere per metre
where l is the mean length of the ﬂux path in
metres.
Thus mmf=NI =Hl amperes

μ0 is a constant called the permeability of free
space (or the magnetic space constant). The value
of μ0 is 4π ×10−7 H/m.
For air, or any non-magnetic medium, the ratio
B/H =μ0
(Although all non-magnetic materials, including
air, exhibit slight magnetic properties, these can
effectively be neglected.)
(g)
μr is the relative permeability and is deﬁned as
ﬂux density in material
ﬂux density in a vacuum
μr varies with the type of magnetic material and,
since it is a ratio of ﬂux densities, it has no unit.
From its deﬁnition, μr for a vacuum is 1.
For all media other than free space, B/H =μ0μr
(h)
Absolute permeability μ=μ0μr
(i)
By plotting measured values of ﬂux density B
against magnetic ﬁeld strength H a magneti-
zation curve (or B/H curve) is produced. For
non-magnetic materials this is a straight line hav-
ing the approximate gradient of μ0. B/H curves
for four materials are shown on page 126.
( j)
From
(g),
μr =B/(μ0H).
Thus the
relative
permeabilityμr of a ferromagneticmaterial is pro-
portional to the gradient of the B/H curve and
varies with the magnetic ﬁeld strength H.
(k)
Reluctance S (or RM) is the ‘magnetic resistance’
of a magnetic circuit to the presence of magnetic
ﬂux.
Reluctance S = Fm

41.2 Magnetic properties of materials
The full theory of magnetismis one of the most complex
of subjects. However, the phenomenon may be satisfac-
torily explained by the use of a simple model. Bohr
and Rutherford, who discovered atomic structure, sug-
gested that electrons move around the nucleus conﬁned
to a plane, like planets around the sun. An even better
model is to consider each electron as having a surface,
which may be spherical or elliptical or something more
complicated.
Magnetic effects in materials are due to the elec-
trons contained in them, the electrons giving rise to
magnetism in the following two ways:
(i)
by revolving around the nucleus
(ii)
by their angular momentum about their own axis,
called spin.
In each of these cases the charge of the electron can
be thought of as moving round in a closed loop and
therefore acting as a current loop.
The main measurable quantity of an atomic model is
the magnetic moment. When applied to a loop of wire
carrying a current,
magnetic moment = current× area of the loop
Electrons associated with atoms possess magnetic
moment which gives rise to their magnetic properties.
Diamagnetism is a phenomenonexhibited by mater-
ials having a relative permeability less than unity. When
electrons move more or less in a spherical orbit around
the nucleus, the magnetic moment due to this orbital
is zero, all the current due to moving electrons being
considered as averaging to zero. If the net magnetic
moment of the electron spins were also zero then there
would be no tendency for the electron motion to line
up in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. However, as a
ﬁeld is being turned on, the ﬂux through the electron
orbitals increases. Thus, considering the orbital as a cir-
cuit, there will be, by Faraday’s laws, an e.m.f. induced
in it which will change the current in the circuit. The
ﬂux change will accelerate the electrons in its orbit,
causing an induced magnetic moment. By Lenz’s law
the ﬂux due to the induced magnetic moment will be
such as to oppose the applied ﬂux. As a result, the net
ﬂux through the material becomes less than in a vacuum.
Since relative permeability is deﬁned as
ﬂux density in material
ﬂux density in vacuum
with diamagnetic materials the relativepermeability
is less than one.
Paramagnetismis a phenomenon exhibited by mate-
rialswheretherelativepermeabilityisgreaterthanunity.
Paramagnetism occurs in substances where atoms have
a permanent magnetic moment. This may be caused by
the orbitals not being spherical or by the spin of the
electrons. Electron spins tend to pair up and cancel each
other. However,there are manyatoms with oddnumbers
of electrons, or in which pairing is incomplete. Such
atoms have what is called a permanent dipole moment.
When a ﬁeld is applied to them they tend to line up with
the ﬁeld, like compass needles, and so strengthen the
ﬂux in that region. (Diamagnetic materials do not tend
to line up with the ﬁeld in this way.) When this effect is
stronger than the diamagnetic effect, the overall effect is
to make the relative permeability greater than one. Such
materials are called paramagnetic.
Ferromagnetic materials
Ferromagnetismis the phenomenonexhibitedby mater-
ials having a relativepermeabilitywhich is considerably
greater than 1 and which varies with ﬂux density. Iron,
cobalt and nickel are the only elements that are ferro-
magnetic at ordinary working temperatures, but there
are several alloys containing one or more of these met-
als as constituents, with widely varying ferromagnetic
properties.
Consider the simple model of a single iron atom rep-
resented in Figure 41.1. It consists of a small, heavy
central nucleus surrounded by a total of 26 electrons.
Each electron has an orbital motion about the nucleus in
a limited region, or shell, such shells being represented
by circles K, L, M and N. The numbers in Figure 41.1
represent the number of electrons in each shell.
The outer shell N contains two loosely held electrons,
these electrons becoming the carriers of electric current,
making iron electrically conductive. There are 14 elec-
trons in the M shell and it is this group that is responsible
for magnetism. An electron carries a negative charge
Figure 41.1 Single iron atom

Part 4
622
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
and a charge in motion constitutes an electric current
with which is associated a magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetism
would therefore result from the orbital motion of each
electron in the atom. However, experimental evidence
indicates that the resultant magnetic effect due to all the
orbital motions in the metal solid is zero; thus the orbital
currents may be disregarded.
In addition to the orbital motion, each electron spins
on its own axis. A rotating charge is equivalent to a cir-
cular current and gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld. In any
atom, all the axes about which the electrons spin are par-
allel, but rotation may be in either direction. In the single
atom shown in Figure 41.1, in each of the K, L and N
shells equal numbers of electrons spin in the clockwise
and anticlockwise directions respectively, and therefore
these shells are magnetically neutral. However, in shell
M, nine of the electrons spin in one direction while
ﬁve spin in the opposite direction. There is therefore a
resultant effect due to four electrons.
The atom of cobalt has 15 electrons in the M shell,
nine spinning in one direction and six in the other. Thus
with cobalt there is a resultant effect due to 3 electrons.
A nickel atom has a resultant effect due to 2 electrons.
The atoms of the paramagnetic elements, such as man-
ganese, chromium or aluminium, also have a resultant
effect for the same reasons as that of iron, cobalt and
nickel. However, in the diamagnetic materials there is an
exact equality between the clockwise and anticlockwise
spins.
The total magnetic ﬁeld of the resultant effect due to
the four electrons in the iron atom is large enough to
inﬂuence other atoms. Thus the orientation of one atom
tends to spread through the material, with atoms acting
together in groups instead of behaving independently.
These groups of atoms, called domains (which tend
to remain permanently magnetized), act as units. Thus,
when a ﬁeld is applied to a piece of iron, these domains
as a whole tend to line up and large ﬂux densities can be
produced. This means that the relative permeability of
such materials is much greater than one. As the applied
ﬁeld is increased, more and more domains align and the
induced ﬂux increases.
The overall magnetic properties of iron alloys and
materials containing iron, such as ferrite (ferrite is a
mixture of iron oxide together with other oxides –
lodestone is a ferrite), depend upon the structure and
composition of the material. However, the presence of
iron ensures marked magnetic properties of some kind
in them. Ferromagnetic effects decrease with temper-
ature, as do those due to paramagnetism. The loss of
ferromagnetism with temperature is more sudden, how-
ever; the temperature at which it has all disappeared
is called the Curie∗temperature. The ferromagnetic
properties reappear on cooling, but any magnetism will
have disappeared. Thus a permanent magnet will be
demagnetized by heating above the Curie temperature
(1040K for iron) but can be remagnetized after cooling.
Above the Curie temperature, ferromagnetics behave as
paramagnetics.
41.3 Hysteresis and hysteresis loss
Hysteresis loop
Let a ferromagnetic material which is completely
demagnetized, i.e. one in which B =H =0 (either by
heating the sample above its Curie temperature or by
reversing the magnetizing current a large number of
times while at the same time, gradually reducing the
current to zero) be subjected to increasing values of
magnetic ﬁeld strength H and the corresponding ﬂux
density B measured. The domains begin to align and
the resulting relationship between B and H is shown by
the curve 0ab in Figure 41.2. At a particular value of
H, shown as 0y, most of the domains will be aligned
and it becomes difﬁcult to increase the ﬂux density any
further. The material is said to be saturated. Thus by is
the saturation ﬂux density.

If the value of H is now reduced it is found that the
ﬂux density follows curve bc, i.e. the domains will tend
to stay aligned even when the ﬁeld is removed. When
H is reduced to zero, ﬂux remains in the iron. This
remanent ﬂux density or remanence is shown as 0c

in Figure 41.2. When H is increased in the opposite
direction, the domains begin to realign in the opposite
direction and the ﬂux density decreases until, at a value
shown as 0d, the ﬂux density has been reduced to zero.
The magnetic ﬁeld strength 0d required to remove the
residual magnetism, i.e. reduce B to zero, is called the
coercive force.
Further increase of H in the reverse direction causes
the ﬂux density to increase in the reverse direction until
saturation is reached, as shown by curve de. If the
reversed magnetic ﬁeld strength 0x is adjusted to the
same value of 0y in the initial direction, then the ﬁnal
ﬂux density xe is the same as yb. If H is varied back-
wards from 0x to 0y, the ﬂux density follows the curve
efgb, similar to curve bcde.
It is seen from Figure 41.2 that the ﬂux density
changes lag behind the changes in the magnetic ﬁeld
strength. This effect is called hysteresis. The closed
ﬁgure bcdefgb is called the hysteresis loop (or the B/H
loop).
Hysteresis loss
A disturbance in the alignment of the domains of a fer-
romagnetic material causes energy to be expended in
taking it through a cycle of magnetization. This energy
appears as heat in the specimen and is called the hyster-
esis loss. Let the hysteresis loop shown in Figure 41.3
be that obtained for an iron ring of mean circumference
l and cross-sectional area a m2 and let the number of
turns on the magnetizing coil be N.

Let the increase of ﬂux density be dB when the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength H is increased by a very small
amount km (see Figure 41.3) in time dt seconds, and
let the current corresponding to 0k be i amperes. Thus
since H =NI/l then 0k =Ni/l, from which,

If hysteresis loops for a given ferromagnetic material
are determined for different maximum values of H,
they are found to lie within one another as shown in

The maximum-sized hysteresis loop for a particular
material is obtained at saturation. If, for example, the
maximum ﬂux density is reduced to half its value at
saturation, the area of the resulting loop is consider-
ably less than half the area of the loop at saturation.
From the areas of a number of such hysteresis loops,
as shown in Figure 41.4, the hysteresis loss per cycle
was found by Steinmetz (an American electrical engi-
neer) to be proportional to (Bm)n, where n is called the
Steinmetz∗index and can have a value between about
1.6 and 3.0, depending on the quality of the ferromag-
netic material and the range of ﬂux density over which
the measurements are made.
From the above it is found that the hysteresis loss is
proportional to the volume ofthe specimenandthe num-
ber of cycles through which the magnetization is taken.
Thus
hysteresis loss, P h = khυf(Bm)n watts

where v =volume in cubic metres, f = frequency in

range of B.
The magnitude of the hysteresis loss depends on the
composition of the specimen and on the heat treatment
and mechanical handling to which the specimen has
been subjected.

steel, which has a high remanence 0c and a large coer-
civity 0d, (b) soft steel, which has a large remanenceand

60Hz frequency, determine the hysteresis loss
for the ferromagnetic specimen.
41.4 Eddy current loss
If a coil is wound on a ferromagnetic core (such as in
a transformer) and alternating current is passed through
Figure 41.6
the coil, an alternating ﬂux is set up in the core. The
alternating ﬂux induces an e.m.f. e in the coil given
by e=N(dφ/dt). However, in addition to the desirable
effect of inducing an e.m.f. in the coil, the alternating
ﬂux induces undesirablevoltages in the iron core. These
induced e.m.f.s set up circulating currents in the core,
knownas eddy currents. Since the core possesses resis-
tance, the eddy currents heat thecore, and this represents
wasted energy.
Eddy currents can be reduced by laminating the core,
i.e. splitting it into thin sheets with very thin layers
of insulating material inserted between each pair of
the laminations (this may be achieved by simply var-
nishing one side of the lamination or by placing paper
between each lamination). The insulation presents a
high resistance and this reduces any induced circulating
currents.
The eddy current loss may be determined as follows.
Let Figure 41.6 represent one strip of the core, having
a thickness of t metres, and consider just a rectangular
prism of the strip having dimensions t m×1m×1m as
shown. The area of the front face ABCD is (t ×1) m2
and, since the ﬂux enters this face at right-angles, the
eddy currents will ﬂow along paths parallel to the long
sides.
Consider two such current paths each of width δx
and distance x m from the centre line of the front face.
The area of the rectangle enclosed by the two paths,
A=(2x)(1)=2x m2. Hence the maximum ﬂux entering
the rectangle,

turns N =1,
E = 8.88Bmf x volts

Resistance R is given by R =ρl/a, where ρ is the
resistivity of the lamination material. Since the current

where ke is a constant.
The volume of the prism is (t ×1×1)m3. Hence the
eddy current loss per m3 is given by
Pe = ke(Bm)2f 2t2 watts per m3
(9)
From equation (9) it is seen that eddy current loss is pro-
portional to the square of the thickness of the core strip.
It is therefore desirable to make lamination strips as thin
as possible. However, at high frequencies where it is not
practicable to make very thin laminations, core losses
may be reduced by using ferrite cores or dust cores.
Ferrite is a ceramic material having magnetic properties
similar to silicon steel, and dust cores consist of ﬁne
particles of carbonyl iron or permalloy (i.e. nickel and
iron), each particle of which is insulated from its neigh-
bour by a binding material. Such materials have a very
high value of resistivity.
Problem 5.
The eddy current loss in a particular
magnetic circuit is 10W/m3. If the frequency of
operation is reduced from 50Hz to 30Hz with the
ﬂux density remaining unchanged, determine the
new value of eddy current loss per cubic metre.
From equation (9), eddy current loss per cubic metre,
Pe =ke(Bm)2f 2t2 or Pe =kf 2, where k =ke(Bm)2t2,
since Bm and t are constant.
When the eddy current loss is 10W/m3, frequency f is
50Hz. Hence 10=k(50)2, from which
constant k = 10

The core of a transformer operating

the core laminations have a thickness of 0.50mm.
The core is redesigned so as to operate with the
same eddy current loss but at a different voltage and
at a frequency of 250Hz. Assuming that at the new
voltage the maximum ﬂux density is one-third of its
original value and the resistivity of the core remains
unaltered, determine the necessary new thickness of
the laminations.

Problem 7.
The core of an inductor has a
hysteresis loss of 40W and an eddy current loss of
20W when operating at 50Hz frequency.
(a) Determine the values of the losses if the
frequency is increased to 60Hz. (b) What will be
the total core loss if the frequency is 50Hz and the
laminations are made one-half of their original
thickness? Assume that the ﬂux density remains
unchanged in each case.
(a)
From equation (3), hysteresis loss,
Ph =khvf (Bm)n=k1f (where k1=khv(Bm)n),
since the ﬂux density and volume are constant.
Thus when the hysteresis is 40W and the fre-
quency 50Hz,
40 = k1(50)
from which, k1 = 40
50 = 0.8
If the frequency is increased to 60Hz,
hysteresis loss, Ph =k1(60)=(0.8)(60)=48 W
From equation (8),
eddy current loss,
Pe =ke(Bm)2f 2t3
=k2f 2 (where (k2=keBm)2t3),
since the ﬂux density and lamination thickness are
constant.
When the eddy current loss is 20W the frequency
is 50Hz. Thus 20=k2(50)2
from which k2 =
20
(50)2 =0.008
If the frequency is increased to 60Hz,
eddy current loss, Pe = k2(60)2 = (0.008)(60)2
= 28.8W
(b)
The hysteresis loss, Ph =khvf (Bm)n, is indepen-
dent of the thickness of the laminations. Thus,
if the thickness of the laminations is halved, the
hysteresis loss remains at 40W
Eddy current loss Pe =ke(Bm)2f 2t3,
i.e. Pe = k3f 2t3, where k3=ke(Bm)2
Thus
20=k3(50)2t3
from which k3 =

From equation (5), e.m.f., E =4.44fN(Bm)(A), from

area, A are constants. Hence
Ph =k1f (E/f )1.6 =k1f −0.6E1.6

= (0.20095)(100)−0.6(1000)−1.6 = 800W
From equation (8)
eddy current loss,Pe =ke(Bm)2f 2t3 = k2(E/f )2f 2
=k2E2
At 500 V,
150=k2(500)2, from which
k2 =

At 1000V,
eddy current loss, Pe =k2(1000)2=(6×10−4)(1000)2

The total core loss Pc is given by Pc =Ph +Pe
If for a particular inductor or transformer, the core
ﬂux density is maintained constant, then Ph =k1f ,
where constant k1=khv(Bm)n, and Pe =k2f 2, where
constant k2 =ke(Bm)2t3. Thus the total core loss
Pc =k1f +k2f 2 and

which is of the straight line form y =mx +c. Thus
if Pc/f is plotted vertically against f horizontally, a
straight line graph results having a gradient k2 and a
vertical-axis intercept k1
If the total core loss Pc is measured over a range of
frequencies, then k1 and k2 may be determined from
the graph of Pc/f against f . Hence the hysteresis loss
Ph(=k1f ) and the eddy current loss Pe(=k2 f 2) at a
given frequency may be determined.
The above method of separation of losses is an

constant value but tends to increase with increase of fre-
quency. However, a reasonable indication of the relative
magnitudes of the hysteresis and eddy current losses in
an iron core may be determined.

41.6 Non-permanent magnetic
materials
General
Nonpermanent magnetic materials are those in which
magnetism may be induced. With the magnetic circuits
of electrical machines, transformers and heavy current
apparatus a high value of ﬂux density B is desirable
so as to limit the cross-sectional area A (=BA) and
therefore the weight and cost involved.At the same time
themagneticﬁeldstrengthH (=NI/l)shouldbeassmall
as possible so as to limit the I 2R losses in the exciting
coils. The relative permeability (μr =B/(μ0H)) and the
saturation ﬂux density should therefore be high. Also,
when ﬂux is continually varying, as in transformers,
inductors and armature cores, low hysteresis and eddy
current losses are essential.
Silicon–iron alloys
In the earliest electrical machines the magnetic circuit
material used was iron with low content of carbon and
other impurities. However, it was later discovered that
the deliberate addition of silicon to the iron brought
about a great improvement in magnetic properties. The
laminations now used in electrical machines and in
transformers at supply frequencies are made of silicon-
steel in which the silicon in different grades of the
material varies in amounts from about 0.5% to 4.5% by

Part 4
632
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
weight. The silicon added to iron increases the resistiv-
ity. This in turn increases the resistance (R =ρl/A) and
thus helps to reduce eddy current loss. The hysteresis
loss is also reduced; however, the silicon reduces the
saturation ﬂux density.
A limit to the amount of silicon which may be added
in practice is set by the mechanical properties of the
material, since the addition of silicon causes a material
to become brittle. Also, the brittleness of a silicon–iron
alloy depends on temperature. About 4.5% silicon is
found to be the upper practical limit for silicon–iron
sheets. Lohysis a typical exampleof a silicon–ironalloy
and is used for the armatures of d.c. machines and for
the rotors and stators of a.c. machines. Stalloy, which
has a higher proportion of silicon and lower losses, is
used for transformer cores.
Silicon steel sheets are often produced by a hot-
rolling process. In these ﬁnished materials the con-
stituent crystals are not arranged in any particular
manner with respect, for example, to the direction of
rolling or the plane of the sheet. If siliconsteel is reduced
in thickness by rolling in the cold state and the mate-
rial is then annealed it is possible to obtain a ﬁnished
sheet in which the crystals are nearly all approximately
parallel to one another. The material has strongly direc-
tional magnetic properties, the rolling direction being
the direction of highest permeability. This direction is
also the direction of lowest hysteresis loss. This type of
material is particularly suitable for use in transformers,
since the axis of the core can be made to correspond with
the rolling direction of the sheet andthus full use is made
of the high permeability, low loss direction of the sheet.
With silicon–iron alloys a maximum magnetic ﬂux
density of about 2 T is possible. With cold-rolled
silicon–steel, used for large machine construction, a
maximum ﬂux density of 2.5 T is possible, whereas
the maximum obtainable with the hot-rolling process
is about 1.8 T. (In fact, with any material, only under
the most abnormal of conditions will the value of ﬂux
density exceed 3 T)
It should be noted that the term ‘iron-core’ implies
thatthecoreismadeofiron;itis,infact,almostcertainly
made from steel, pure iron being extremelyhardto come
by. Equally, an iron alloy is generally a steel and so it is
preferred to describe a core as being a steel rather than
an iron core.
Nickel–iron alloys
Nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic elements and
when they are alloyed together in different propor-
tions a series of useful magnetic alloys is obtained.
With about 25%–30% nickel content added to iron, the
alloy tends to be very hard and almost non-magnetic
at room temperature. However, when the nickel con-
tent is increased to, say, 75%–80% (together with small
amounts of molybdenum and copper), very high val-
ues of initial and maximum permeabilities and very low
values of hysteresis loss are obtainable if the alloys are
given suitable heat treatment. For example, Permalloy,
having a content of 78% nickel, 3% molybdenum and
the remainder iron, has an initial permeability of 20000
and a maximumpermeability of 100000compared with
values of 250 and 5000, respectively, for iron. The max-
imum ﬂux density for Permalloyis about 0.8T.Mumetal
(76% nickel, 5% copper and 2% chromium) has simi-
lar characteristics. Such materials are used for the cores
of current and a.f. transformers, for magnetic ampliﬁers
and also for magnetic screening. However, nickel–iron
alloys are limited in that theyhave a low saturationvalue
when compared with iron. Thus, in applications where
it is necessary to work at a high ﬂux density, nickel–
iron alloys are inferior to both iron and silicon–iron.
Also nickel–iron alloys tend to be more expensive than
silicon–iron alloys.
Eddy current loss is proportional to the thickness of
lamination squared, thus such losses can be reduced by
using laminations as thin as possible. Nickel–iron alloy
strip as thin as 0.004mm, wound in a spiral, may be
used.
Dust cores
In many circuits high permeability may be unnecessary
or it may be more important to have a very high resis-
tivity. Where this is so, metal powder or dust cores are
widely used up to frequencies of 150MHz. These con-
sist of particles of nickel–iron–molybdenum for lower
frequenciesand iron for the higherfrequencies.The par-
ticles, which are individually covered with an insulating
ﬁlm, are mixed with an insulating, resinous binder and
pressed into shape.
Ferrites
Magnetite, or ferrous ferrite, is a compound of fer-
ric oxide and ferrous oxide and possesses magnetic
properties similar to those of iron. However, being a
semiconductor, it has a very high resistivity. Manufac-
tured ferrites are compounds of ferric oxide andan oxide
of some other metal such as manganese, nickel or zinc.
Ferrites are free from eddy current losses at all but the
highest frequencies (i.e. >100MHz), but have a much
lower initial permeability compared with nickel–iron
alloys or silicon–iron alloys. Ferrites have typically a

Part 4
Magnetic materials
633
maximum ﬂux density of about 0.4 T. Ferrite cores are
used in audio-frequency transformers and inductors.
41.7 Permanent magnetic materials
A permanent magnet is one in which the material used
exhibits magnetism without the need for excitation by
a current-carrying coil. The silicon–iron and nickel–
iron alloys discussed in Section 41.6 are ‘soft’ magnetic
materials having high permeability and hence low hys-
teresis loss. The opposite characteristics are required in
the ‘hard’ materials used to make permanent magnets.
In permanent magnets, high remanent ﬂux density and
high coercive force, after magnetization to saturation,
are desirable in order toresist demagnetization.The hys-
teresis loop should embrace the maximumpossible area.
Possibly the best criterion of the merit of a permanent
magnet is its maximum energy product (BH)m, i.e. the
maximum value of the product of the ﬂux density B and
the magnetic ﬁeld strength H along the demagnetization
curve (shown as cd in Figure 41.2). A rough criterion is
the product of coercive force and remanent ﬂux density,
i.e. (0d)(0c) in Figure 41.2. The earliest materials used
for permanent magnets were tungsten and chromium
steel, followed by a series of cobalt steels, to give both a
high remanent ﬂux density and a high value of (BH) m.
Alniwastheﬁrstofthealuminium–nickel–ironalloys
to be discovered, and with the addition of cobalt, tita-
nium and niobium, the Alnico series of magnets was
developed, the properties of which vary according to
composition. These materials are very hard and brittle.
Many alloys with other compositions and trade names
are commercially available.
A considerable advance was later made when it was
found that directional magnetic properties could be
induced in alloys of suitable composition if they were
heated in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. This discovery led to
the powerful Alcomex and Hycomex series of magnets.
By using special casting techniques to give a grain-
oriented structure, even better properties are obtained
if the ﬁeld applied during heat treatment is parallel to
the columnar crystals in the magnet. The values of coer-
civity, the remanent ﬂux density and hence (BH)m are
high for these alloys.
The most recent and most powerful permanent mag-
nets discovered are made by powder metallurgy tech-
niques and are based on an intermetallic compound of
cobalt and samarium. These are very expensive and are
only available in a limited range of small sizes.

Chapter 42
Dielectrics and dielectric loss
Why it is important to understand: Dielectric and dielectric loss
Dielectric loss is the loss of energy that goes into heating a dielectric material in a varying electric ﬁeld. For
example, a capacitor incorporated in an a.c. circuit is alternately charged and discharged each half-cycle.
During the alternation of polarity of the plates, the charges must be displaced through the dielectric
ﬁrst in one direction and then in the other, and overcoming the opposition that they encounter leads
to a production of heat through dielectric loss, a characteristic that must be considered when applying
capacitors to electric circuits, such as those in radio and television receivers. Dielectric losses depend
on frequency and the dielectric material. Heating through dielectric loss is widely employed industrially
for heating thermosetting glues, for drying lumber and other ﬁbrous materials, for preheating plastics
before moulding and for fast jelling and drying of foam rubber. An important property of a dielectric
is its ability to support an electrostatic ﬁeld while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat. The
lower the dielectric loss (the proportion of energy lost as heat), the more effective is a dielectric material.
The study of dielectric properties is concerned with the storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic
energy in materials. It is important to explain various phenomena in electronics, optics and solid-state
physics. This chapter assesses the dielectric properties of materials, and determines, via calculations,
dielectric loss, loss angle, Q-factor and dissipation factor of capacitors.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
understand electric ﬁelds, capacitance and permittivity
•
assess the dielectric properties of materials
•
determine dielectric loss, loss angle, Q-factor and dissipation factor of capacitors
42.1 Electric ﬁelds, capacitance
and permittivity
Any region in which an electric charge experiences
a force is called an electrostatic ﬁeld. Electric ﬁelds,
Coulomb’s law, capacitance and permittivity are dis-
cussed in Chapter 8 – refer back to page 106. Summa-
rizing the main formulae:
Electric ﬁeld strength, E= V

Capacitance C = Q

Electric ﬂux density, D= Q
A coulombs/metre2

E = ε0εr = ε
Relative permittivity εr = ﬂux density in material

The insulating medium separating charged surfaces
is called a dielectric. Compared with conductors,
dielectric materials have very high resistivities (and

hence low conductance, since ρ =1/σ). They are there-
fore used to separate conductors at different potentials,
such as capacitor plates or electric power lines.
For a parallel-plate capacitor,
capacitance C = ε0εr A(n−1)
d
42.2 Polarization
When a dielectric is placed between charged plates, the
capacitance of the system increases. The mechanism by
which a dielectric increases capacitance is called polar-
ization. In an electric ﬁeld the electrons and atomic
nuclei of the dielectric material experience forces in
opposite directions. Since the electrons in an insulator
cannot ﬂow, each atom becomes a tiny dipole (i.e. an
arrangementoftwoelectricchargesofoppositepolarity)
withpositiveandnegativechargesslightlyseparated,i.e.
the material becomes polarized.
Within the material this produces no discernible
effects. However,on the surfaces of the dielectric, layers
of charge appear. Electrons are drawn towards the pos-
itive potential, producing a negative charge layer, and
away from the negative potential, leaving positive sur-
face charge behind. Therefore the dielectric becomes
a volume of neutral insulator with surface charges of
opposite polarity on opposite surfaces. The result of
this is that the electric ﬁeld inside the dielectric is
less than the electric ﬁeld causing the polarization,
because these two charge layers give rise to a ﬁeld which
opposes the electric ﬁeld causing it. Since electric ﬁeld
strength, E =V/d, the p.d. between the plates, V =Ed.
Thus, if E decreases when the dielectric is inserted,
then V falls too and this drop in p.d. occurs without
change of charge on the plates. Thus, since capacitance
C =Q/V , capacitance increases, this increase being by
a factor equal to εr above that obtained with a vacuum
dielectric.
There are two main ways in which polarization takes
place:
(i)
The electric ﬁeld, as explained above, pulls the
electrons and nuclei in opposite directions because
they have opposite charges, which makes each
atom into an electric dipole. The movement is only
small and takes place very fast since the electrons
are very light. Thus, if the applied electric ﬁeld
is varied periodically, the polarization, and hence
the permittivity due to these induced dipoles,
is independent of the frequency of the applied
ﬁeld.
(ii)
Some atoms have a permanent electric dipole as
a result of their structure and, when an electric
ﬁeld is applied, they turn and tend to align along
the ﬁeld. The response of the permanent dipoles is
slower than the response of the induced dipoles
and that part of the relative permittivity which
arises from this type of polarization decreases with
increase of frequency.
Most materials contain both induced and perma-
nent dipoles, so the relative permittivity usually
tends to decrease with increase of frequency.
42.3 Dielectric strength
The maximum amount of ﬁeld strength that a dielectric
can withstand is called the dielectric strength of the
material. When an electric ﬁeld is established across
the faces of a material, molecular alignment and dis-
tortion of the electron orbits around the atoms of the
dielectric occur. This produces a mechanical stress
which in turn generates heat. The production of heat
represents a dissipation of power, such a loss being
present in all practical dielectrics, especially when used
in high-frequency systems where the ﬁeld polarity is
continually and rapidly changing.
A dielectric whose conductivity is not zero between
the plates of a capacitor provides a conducting path
along which charges can ﬂow and thus discharge the
capacitor. The resistance R of the dielectric is given
by R =ρl/a, l being the thickness of the dielectric ﬁlm
(which may be as small as 0.001mm) and a being the
area of the capacitor plates. The resistance R of the
dielectric may be represented as a leakage resistance
across an ideal capacitor (see Section 42.8 on dielectric
loss). The required lower limit for acceptable resis-
tance between the plates varies with the use to which
the capacitor is put. High-quality capacitors have high
shunt-resistance values. A measure of dielectric quality
is the time taken for a capacitor to discharge a given
amount through the resistance of the dielectric. This is
related to the product CR.
Capacitance,C ∝
area
thickness
and
1
R ∝
area
thickness
thus CR is a characteristic of a given dielectric. In prac-
tice, circuit design is considerably simpliﬁed if the shunt
conductance of a capacitor can be ignored (i.e. R →∞)

Part 4
Dielectrics and dielectric loss

and the capacitor therefore regarded as an open circuit
for direct current.
Since capacitance C of a parallel plate capacitor is
given by C =ε0εrA/d, reducing the thickness d of a
dielectric ﬁlm increases the capacitance, but decreases
the resistance. It also reduces the voltage the capacitor
canwithstandwithoutbreakdown(sinceV =Q/C).Any
material will eventually break down, usually destruc-
tively, when subjected to a sufﬁciently large electric
ﬁeld. A spark may occur at breakdown which produces a
hole through the ﬁlm. The metal ﬁlm forming the metal
platesmaybeweldedtogetheratthepointofbreakdown.
Breakdown depends on electric ﬁeld strength E
(where E =V/d), so thinner ﬁlms will break down with
smaller voltages across them. This is the main rea-
son for limiting the voltage that may be applied to a
capacitor. All practical capacitors have a safe working
voltage stated on them, generally at a particular maxi-
mum temperature. Figure 42.1 shows the typical shapes
of graphs expected for electric ﬁeld strength E plot-
ted against thickness and for breakdown voltage plotted
against thickness. The shape of the curves depend on a
number of factors, and these include:
(i)
the type of dielectric material,
(ii)
the shape and size of the conductors associated
with it,
(iii)
the atmospheric pressure,
(iv)
the humidity/moisture content of the material,
(v)
the operating temperature.
Dielectric strength is an important factor in the design
of capacitors as well as transformers and high-voltage
insulators, and in motors and generators. Dielectrics
vary in their ability to withstand large ﬁelds. Some
typical values of dielectric strength, together with resis-
tivity and relative permittivity, are shown in Table 42.1.
The ceramics have very high relative permittivities and
they tend to be ‘ferroelectric’, i.e. they do not lose

ferroelectric effects are present, the charge on a capac-
itor is given by Q = (CV)+(remanent polarization).
These dielectrics often possess an appreciable nega-
tive temperature coefﬁcient of resistance. Despite this,
a high permittivity is often very desirable and ceramic
dielectrics are widely used.
42.4 Thermal effects
As the temperature of most dielectrics is increased, the
insulation resistance falls rapidly. This causes the leak-
age current to increase, which generates further heat.
Eventually a condition known as thermal avalanche or
thermal runaway may develop, when the heat is gener-
ated faster than it can be dissipated to the surrounding
environment. The dielectric will burn and thus fail.
Thermal effects may often seriously inﬂuence the
choice and application of insulating materials. Some
important factors to be considered include:
(i)
the melting-point (for example, for waxes used
in paper capacitors),
(ii)
ageing due to heat,
(iii)
the maximum temperature that a material
will withstand without serious deterioration of
essential properties,

resistance to electric arcs,

42.5 Mechanical properties
Mechanical properties determine, to varying degrees,
the suitability of a solid material for use as an insulator:
tensile strength, transverse strength, shearing strength
and compressive strength are often speciﬁed. Most
solid insulations have a degree of inelasticity and many
are quite brittle, thus it is often necessary to consider
features such as compressibility, deformation under

42.6 Types of practical capacitor
Practical types of capacitor are characterized by the
materialusedfortheirdielectric.Themaintypesinclude:
variable air, mica, paper, ceramic, plastic, titanium
oxide and electrolytic, together with supercapacitors.
Refer back to Chapter 8, Section 8.12, page 117, for a
description of each type.
42.7 Liquid dielectrics and gas
insulation
Liquid dielectrics used for insulation purposes are
reﬁned mineral oils, silicone ﬂuids and synthetic oils
such as chlorinated diphenyl. The principal uses of liq-
uid dielectrics are as a ﬁlling and cooling medium for
transformers, capacitors and rheostats, as an insulat-
ing and arc-quenching medium in switchgear such as
circuit breakers, and as an impregnant of absorbent insu-
lations–forexample,wood,slate,paperandpressboard,
used mainly in transformers, switchgear, capacitors and
cables.
Two gases used as insulation are nitrogen and
sulphur hexaﬂuoride. Nitrogen is used as an insulation
medium in some sealed transformers and in power
cables, and sulphur hexaﬂuoride is ﬁnding increasing
use in switchgear both as an insulant and as an arc-
extinguishing medium.
42.8 Dielectric loss and loss angle
In capacitors with solid dielectrics, losses can be
attributed to two causes:
(i)
dielectric hysteresis, a phenomenon by which
energyis expendedand heat producedas the result
of the reversal of electrostatic stress in a dielectric
subjected to alternating electric stress – this loss is
analogous to hysteresis loss in magnetic materials;
(ii)
leakage currents that may ﬂow through the
dielectric and along surface paths between the
terminals.
The total dielectric loss may be represented as the loss
in an additional resistance connected betweenthe plates.
This may be represented as either a small resistance in
series with an ideal capacitor or as a large resistance in
parallel with an ideal capacitor.
Series representation
The circuit and phasor diagrams for the series represen-
tation are shown in Figure 42.2. The circuit phase angle
is shown as angle φ. If resistance RS is zero then current
I would lead voltage V by 90◦, this being the case of
a perfect capacitor. The difference between 90◦and the
circuit phase angle φ is the angle shown as δ. This is
known as the loss angle of the capacitor, i.e.
loss angle, δ = (90◦−φ)
For the equivalent series circuit,

Chapter 43
Field theory
Why it is important to understand: Field theory
The conductor and sheath of coaxial cables, such as a telegraph cable and single-conductor lead-sheath
power cable, are concentric cylinders. The capacitance between the inner cylinder, the conductor, and
outer cylinder, the sheath or shield, has an important effect on the characteristics ofsuch cables. Whenever
two nearby conductors of any size or shape carry equal and opposite charges, the combination of these
conducting bodies is called a capacitor. Because the isolated conducting bodies have equal but opposite
charges on them, an electric ﬁeld exists in the space between them. The importance of the capacitor
lies in the fact that energy can be stored in the electric ﬁeld between the two conducting bodies. The
main properties of a co-axial cable are its inductance, capacitance, effective shunt conductance and series
resistance per unit length. Taken together these inﬂuence the signal transmission and loss properties when
a length of cable is employed as part of a system. This chapter looks at some aspects of ﬁeld theory – ﬁeld
plotting, capacitance and inductance of concentric cylinders, capacitance and inductance of isolated twin
line and energy stored in electric and electromagnetic ﬁelds.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•

43.1 Field plotting by curvilinear
squares
Electric ﬁelds, magnetic ﬁelds and conduction ﬁelds
(i.e. a region in which an electric current ﬂows) are ana-
logous, i.e. they all exhibit similar characteristics. Thus
they may all be analysed by similar processes. In the
following the electric ﬁeld is analysed.
Figure 43.1 shows two parallel plates, A and B. Let
the potential on plate A be +V volts and that on plate
B be −V volts. The force acting on a point charge of 1
coulomb placed between the plates is the electric ﬁeld
strength E. It is measured in the direction of the ﬁeld and
its magnitude depends on the p.d. between the plates and
the distance between the plates. In Figure 43.1, moving
along a line of force from plate B to plate A means
moving from −V to +V volts. The p.d. between the
plates is therefore 2V volts and this potential changes
linearly when movingfrom one plate to the other. Hence
a potential gradient is followed which changes by equal
amounts for each unit of distance moved.
Lines may be drawn connecting together all points
within the ﬁeld having equal potentials. These lines are
called equipotential lines and these have been drawn in
Figure 43.1for potentials of 2
3 V, 1
3 V, 0, −1
3 V and −2
3 V.
The zero equipotential line represents earth potential
and the potentials on plates A and B are respectively
above and below earth potential. Equipotential lines
form part of an equipotential surface. Such surfaces are
parallel to the plates shown in Figure 43.1 and the plates
themselves are equipotential surfaces. There can be no
current ﬂow between any given points on such a surface
sinceallpointsonanequipotentialsurfacehavethesame
potential. Thus a line of force (or ﬂux) must intersect an
equipotential surface at right-angles. A line of force in
an electrostatic ﬁeld is often termed a streamline.
An electric ﬁeld distribution for a concentric cylin-
der capacitor is shown in Figure 43.2. An electric ﬁeld
is set up in the insulating medium between two good
conductors. Any volt drop within the conductors can
usually be neglected compared with the p.d.s across
Figure 43.1 Lines of force intersecting equipotential lines in
an electric ﬁeld
Figure 43.2 Electric ﬁeld distribution for a concentric cylin-
der capacitor
the insulation since the conductors have a high con-
ductivity. All points on the conductors are thus at the
same potential so that the conductors form the bound-
ary equipotentials for the electrostatic ﬁeld. Streamlines
(or lines of force) which must cut all equipotentials
at right-angles leave one boundary at right-angles,
pass across the ﬁeld and enter the other boundary at
right-angles.
In a magneticﬁeld, a streamline is a line so drawn that
its directionis everywhereparallel to the directionof the
magnetic ﬂux. An equipotential surface in a magnetic
ﬁeld is the surface over which a magnetic pole may be
moved without the expenditure of work or energy.
In a conductionﬁeld, a streamline is a line drawn with
a direction which is everywhere parallel to the direction
of the current ﬂow.
A method of solving certain ﬁeld problems by a
form of graphical estimation is available which may
only be applied, however, to plane linear ﬁelds; exam-
ples include the ﬁeld existing between parallel plates
or between two long parallel conductors. In general,
the plane of a ﬁeld may be divided into a number of
squares formed between the line of force (i.e. stream-
line) and the equipotential. Figure 43.3 shows a typical
pattern. In most cases true squares will not exist, since
the streamlines and equipotentials are curved. However,
since the streamlines and the equipotentials intersect at
right-angles, square-like ﬁgures are formed, and these
are usually called ‘curvilinear squares’. The square-
like ﬁgure shown in Figure 43.3 is a curvilinear square
since, on successive sub-division by equal numbers of
Figure 43.3 Curvilinear square

Part 4
644
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
intermediate streamlines and equipotentials, the smaller
ﬁgures are seen to approach a true square form.
When sub-dividing to give a ﬁeld in detail, and in
some cases for the initial equipotentials, ‘Moore’s cir-
cle’ technique can be useful in that it tends to eliminate
the trial and error process. If, say, two ﬂux lines and
an equipotential are given and it is required to draw
a neighbouring equipotential, a circle tangential to the
three given lines is constructed. The new equipotential
is then approximately tangential to the circle, as shown
in Figure 43.3.
Consider the electric ﬁeld established between two
parallel metal plates, as shown in Figure 43.4. The
streamlines and the equipotential lines are shown
sketched and are seen to form curvilinear squares. Con-
sider a true square abcd lying between equipotentials
AB and CD. Let this square be the end of x metres
depth of the ﬁeld forming a ﬂux tube between adja-
cent equipotential surfaces abfe and cdhg as shown in
Figure 43.5. Let l be the length of side of the squares.
Then the capacitance C1 of the ﬂux tube is given by
C1 = ε0εr (area of plate)
plate separation
i.e. C1 = ε0εr(lx)
l
= ε0εrx
(1)
Thus the capacitance of the ﬂux tube whose end is a true
square is independent of the size of the square.
Let the distance between the plates of a capacitor
be divided into an exact number of parts, say n
(in Figure 43.4, n=4). Using the same scale, the
Figure 43.4
Figure 43.5
breadth of the plate is divided into a number of
parts (which is not always an integer value), say m
(in Figure 43.4, m=10, neglecting fringing). Thus
between equipotentials AB and CD in Figure 43.4
there are m squares in parallel and so there are m
capacitors in parallel. For m capacitors connected in
parallel, the equivalent capacitance CT is given by
CT =C1 +C2 +C3 + ··· +Cm. If the capacitors have
the same value, i.e. C1 =C2 =C3 = ··· =Cm =Ct, then
CT = mCt
(2)
Similarly, there are n squares in series in Figure 43.4
and thus n capacitors in series.
For n capacitors connected in series, the equivalent
capacitance CT is given by
1
CT
= 1
C1
+ 1
C2
+ ··· + 1
Cn
If C1 =C2 = ··· =Cn =Ct
then 1/CT =n/Ct, from
which
CT = Ct
n
(3)
Thus if m is the number of parallel squares measured
along each equipotential and n is the number of series
squares measured along each streamline (or line of
force), then the total capacitance C of the ﬁeld is given,
from equations (1)–(3), by
C = ε0εr xm
n farads
(4)
For example, let a parallel-plate capacitor have plates
8mm×5mm and spaced 4mm apart (see Figure 43.6).
Let the dielectric have a relative permittivity 3.5.
If the distance between the plates is divided into, say,
four equipotential lines, then each is 1mm apart. Hence
n=4.
Using the same scale, the number of lines of force
from plate P to plate Q must be 8, i.e. m=8. This
is, of course, neglecting any fringing. From equa-
tion (4), capacitance C =ε0εrx(m/n), where x =5mm
or 0.005m in this case. Hence
C = (8.85 × 10−12)(3.5)(0.005)

The capacitance found by each method gives the same
value; this is expectedsince the ﬁeld is uniform between
the plates, giving a ﬁeld plot of true squares.)
The effect of fringing may be considered by estimat-
ing the capacitance by ﬁeld plotting. This is described
below.
In the side view of the plates shown in Figure 43.7, RS is
the medial line of force or medial streamline, by symme-
try. Also XY is the medial equipotential. The ﬁeld may
thus be divided into four separate symmetrical parts.
Figure 43.7
Considering just the top-left part of the ﬁeld, the
ﬁeld plot is estimated as follows, with reference to
Figure 43.8:
(i)
Estimate the position of the equipotential EF
which has the mean potential between that of the
plate and that of the medial equipotential X0. F
is not taken too far since it is difﬁcult to estimate.
Point E will lie slightly closer to point Z than
point O.
(ii)
Estimate the positions of intermediate equipoten-
tials GH and IJ.
(iii)
All the equipotential lines plotted are
2
4, i.e.
0.5mm apart. Thus a series of streamlines, cutting
the equipotential at right-angles, are drawn, the
streamlines being spaced 0.5mm apart, with the
object of forming, as far as possible, curvilinear
squares.
It may be necessary to erase the equipotentials and
redraw them to ﬁt the lines of force. The ﬁeld between
the plates is almost uniform, giving a ﬁeld plot of true
squares in this region. At the corner of the plates the
squares are smaller, this indicating a great stress in this
region.
Figure 43.8
On the top of the plate the squares become very large,
indicating that the main ﬁeld exists between the plates.
From equation (4),
total capacitance, C = ε0εrx m
n farads
The number of parallel squares measured along
each equipotential is about 13 in this case and
the number of series squares measured along each
line of force is 4. Thus, for the plates shown in
Figure 43.7, m=2×13=26 and n=2×4=8. Since x

43.2 Capacitance between
concentric cylinders
A concentric cable is one which contains two or more
separate conductors, arranged concentrically (i.e. hav-
ing a common centre), with insulation between them.
In a coaxial cable, the central conductor, which may
be either solid or hollow, is surrounded by an outer
tubular conductor, the space in between being occupied
by a dielectric. If air is the dielectric then concen-
tric insulating discs are used to prevent the conductors
touching each other. The two kinds of cable serve dif-
ferent purposes. The main feature they have in common
is a complete absence of external ﬂux and therefore a
complete absence of interference with and from other
circuits.
The electric ﬁeld between two concentric cylinders
(i.e. a coaxial cable) is shown in the cross-section
of Figure 43.13. The conductors form the boundary
equipotentials for the ﬁeld, the boundary equipotentials
in Figure 43.13 being concentric cylinders of radii a
and b. The streamlines, or lines of force, are radial lines
cutting the equipotentials at right-angles.
Let Q be the charge per unit length of the inner con-
ductor. Then the total ﬂux across the dielectric per unit

A curvilinearsquare is shown shaded in Figure 43.14.
Such squares can be made to have the same capacitance
as a true square by the correctchoice of spacing between
the lines of force and the equipotential surfaces in the
ﬁeld plot.
From equation (7), the capacitance between cylindrical
equipotential lines at radii ra and rb is given by
C = 2πε0εr
ln(rb/ra) farads/metre
Thus for a sector of θ radians (see Figure 43.14) the

Now if θ =ln(rb/ra) then C =ε0εr F/m, the same as for

if, say, two equipotential surfaces are chosen within
the dielectric as shown in Figure 43.14, then eθ =r2/r1,
eθ =r3/r2 and eθ =r4/r3. Hence

Thus there will be 2π/0.462=13.6 sectors in the ﬁeld

The ﬁeld plot is shown in Figure 43.15. The number of

Thus ﬁeld plotting using curvilinear squares provides
an alternative method of determining the capacitance

Problem 8.
A concentric cable has a core
diameter of 20mm and a sheath inside diameter of
60mm. The permittivity of the dielectric is 3.2.
Using three equipotential surfaces within the
dielectric, determine the capacitance of the cable
per metre length by the method of curvilinear
squares. Draw the ﬁeld plot for the cable.
The ﬁeld plot consists of radial lines of force dividing
the cable cross-section into a number of sectors, the
lines of force cutting the equipotential surfaces at right-
angles. Since three equipotential surfaces are required
in the dielectric, four capacitors in series are found in
each sector of θ radians.
In Figure 43.16, r1 =20/2=10mm and r5 =60/2=

43.5 Induced e.m.f. and inductance
A current ﬂowing in a coil of wire is accompanied by
a magnetic ﬂux linking with the coil. If the current
changes, the ﬂux linkage (i.e. the product of ﬂux and
the number of turns) changes and an e.m.f. is induced
in the coil. The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. e in a
coil of N turns is given by
e = N dφ
dt volts
where dφ/dt is the rate of change of ﬂux.
Inductance is the name given to the property of a cir-
cuit whereby there is an e.m.f. induced into the circuit
by the change of ﬂux linkages produced by a current
change. The unit of inductance is the henry∗, H. A
circuit has an inductance of 1H when an e.m.f. of 1V
is induced in it by a current changing uniformly at the
rate of 1A/s.
The magnitude of the e.m.f. induced in a coil of
inductance L henry is given by
e = L di
dt volts
where di/dt is the rate of change of current.
If a current changing uniformly from zero to I
amperes produces a uniform ﬂux change from zero to φ
webers in t seconds then (from above) average induced
e.m.f., Eav =Nφ/t =LI/t, from which
inductance of coil, L = Nφ

Flux linkage means the product of ﬂux, in webers,
and the number of turns with which the ﬂux is linked.
Hence ﬂux linkage=Nφ. Thus since L=Nφ/I, induc-
tance=ﬂux linkages per ampere.
43.6 Inductance of a concentric
cylinder (or coaxial cable)
Skin effect
When a direct current ﬂows in a uniform conductor the
current will tend to distribute itself uniformly over the
cross-section of the conductor. However, with alternat-
ing current, particularly if the frequency is high, the
current carried by the conductor is not uniformly dis-
tributed over the available cross-section, but tends to
be concentrated at the conductor surface. This is called
skin effect. When current is ﬂowing through a con-
ductor, the magnetic ﬂux that results is in the form of
concentric circles. Some of this ﬂux exists within the
conductor and links with the current more strongly near
the centre. The result is that the inductance of the central
part of the conductor is greater than the inductance of
the conductor near the surface. This is because of the
greater number of ﬂux linkages existing in the central
region. At high frequencies the reactance (XL =2πfL)

of the extra inductance is sufﬁciently large to seriously
affect the ﬂow of current, most of which ﬂows along
the surface of the conductor where the impedance is
low, rather than near the centre where the impedance
is high.
Inductance due to internal linkages
at low frequency
When a conductor is used at high frequency the depth
of penetration of the current is small compared with the
conductor cross-section. Thus the internal linkages may
be considered as negligible and the circuit inductance is
that due to the ﬁelds in the surroundingspace. However,
at very low frequency the current distribution is consid-
ered uniform over the conductor cross-section and the
inductance due to ﬂux linkages has its maximum value.
Consider a conductor of radius R, as shown in

43.8 Energy stored in an

Magnetic energy in a nonmagnetic medium
For a nonmagnetic medium the relative permeability,
μr =1 and B =μ0H
Thus the magnetic ﬁeld strength H is proportionalto the
ﬂux density B and a graph of B against H is a straight
line, as shown in Figure 43.23.

It was shown in Section 41.3 that, when the ﬂux density
is increased by an amount dB due to an increase dH in
the magnetic ﬁeld strength, then
energy supplied to the magnetic circuit
= area of shaded strip (in joules per cubic metre)

only energy expended is that supplied to maintain the

i.e. the I 2R loss, which is dissipated as heat.
For an inductive circuit containing resistance R and

Attenuators
Why it is important to understand: Attenuators
Attenuation is the gradual loss in intensity of any kind of ﬂux through a medium. For instance, sunlight
is attenuated by dark glasses, X-rays are attenuated by lead and light and sound are attenuated by
water. In electrical engineering and telecommunications, attenuation affects the propagation of waves
and signals in electrical circuits, in optical ﬁbres, as well as in air (radio waves). RF attenuators reduce
the level of the signal; this may be required to protect a stage from receiving a signal level that is too
high. An attenuator may be used to provide an accurate impedance match as most ﬁxed attenuators
offer a well-deﬁned impedance, or attenuators may be used in a variety of areas where signal levels
need to be controlled. Attenuation is a general term that refers to any reduction in the strength of a
signal. Attenuation occurs with any type of signal, whether digital or analogue. Sometimes called loss,
attenuation is a natural consequence of signal transmission over long distances. This chapter explains the
function of attenuation, logarithmic units and the design of T, π and L attenuator sections. In addition,
attenuation for two-port networks in cascade, and ABCD parameters for networks is explained.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
understand the function of an attenuator
•
understand characteristic impedance and calculate for given values
•
appreciate and calculate logarithmic ratios
•
design symmetrical T and symmetrical π attenuators given required attenuation and characteristic
impedance
•
appreciate and calculate insertion loss
•
determine iterative and image impedances for asymmetrical T and π networks
•

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
44.1 Introduction
An attenuator is a device for introducing a speci-
ﬁed loss between a signal source and a matched load
without upsetting the impedance relationship necessary
for matching. The loss introduced is constant irrespec-
tive of frequency; since reactive elements (L or C) vary
with frequency, it follows that ideal attenuators are net-
works containing pure resistances. A ﬁxed attenuator
section is usually known as a ‘pad’.
Attenuation is a reductionin the magnitudeof a volt-
age or current due to its transmission over a line or
through an attenuator. Any degree of attenuation may
be achieved with an attenuator by suitable choice of
resistance values, but the input and output impedances
of the pad must be such that the impedance conditions
existing in the circuit into which it is connected are not
disturbed. Thus an attenuator must provide the correct
input and output impedances as well as providing the
required attenuation.
Attenuation sections are made up of resistances
connected as T or π arrangements (as introduced in
Chapter 37).
Two-port networks
Networks in which electrical energy is fed in at one pair
of terminals and taken out at a second pair of terminals
are called two-port networks. Thus an attenuator is a
two-port network, as are transmission lines, transform-
ers and electronic ampliﬁers. The network between the
input port and the output port is a transmission network
for which a known relationship exists between the input
and output currents and voltages. If a network contains
only passive circuit elements, such as in an attenuator,
the network is said to be passive; if a network contains
a source of e.m.f., such as in an electronic ampliﬁer, the
network is said to be active.
Figure 44.1(a) shows a T-network, which is termed
symmetrical if ZA =ZB; Figure 44.1(b) shows a
π-network
which
is
symmetrical
if
ZE =ZF .
If ZA ̸=ZB
in Figure 44.1(a) and ZE ̸=ZF
in
Figure 44.1(b), the sections are termed asymmetrical.
Both networks shown have one common terminal,
which may be earthed, and are therefore said to be
unbalanced. The balanced form of the T-network is
shown in Figure 44.2(a) and the balanced form of the
π-network is shown in Figure 44.2(b).
Symmetrical T- and π-attenuators are discussed in
Section 44.4 and asymmetrical attenuators are dis-
cussed in Sections 44.6 and 44.7. Before this it is
Figure 44.1 (a) T-network, (b) π-network
Figure 44.2 (a) Balanced T-network, (b) Balanced π-network
important to understand the concept of characteristic
impedance, which is explained generally in Section 44.2
(characteristic impedances will be used again in
Chapter 47), and logarithmic units, discussed in
Section 44.3. Another important aspect of attenuators,
that of insertion loss, is discussed in Section 44.5. To
obtain greater attenuation, sections may be connected
in cascade, and this is discussed in Section 44.8.
Finally,
in
Section
44.9, ABCD
parameters are
explained.
44.2 Characteristic impedance
The input impedance of a network is the ratio of voltage
to current (in complexform) at the input terminals. With
a two-port network the input impedance often varies
according to the load impedance across the output ter-
minals. For any passive two-port network it is found
that a particular value of load impedance can always be
found which will produce an input impedance having
the same value as the load impedance. This is called
the iterative impedance for an asymmetrical network
and its value depends on which pair of terminals is
taken to be the input and which the output (there are
thus two values of iterative impedance, one for each
direction). For a symmetrical network there is only one
value for the iterative impedance and this is called the
characteristic impedance of the symmetrical two-port
network. Let the characteristic impedance be denoted
by Z0. Figure 44.3 shows a symmetrical T-network
terminated in an impedance Z0

Thus the characteristic impedance Z0 is given by
Z0 =√(ZOCZSC) whether the networkis a symmetrical

44.3 Logarithmic ratios
The ratio of two powers P1 and P2 may be expressed in
logarithmic form as shown in Chapter 12.
Let P1 be the input power to a system and P2 the output
power.
If logarithms to base 10 are used, then the ratio is said
to be in bels, i.e. power ratio in bels=lg(P2/P1). The
bel is a large unit and the decibel (dB) is more often
used, where 10 decibels=1 bel, i.e.
power ratio in decibels = 10lgP2
P1
(4)
The bel is named after Alexander Graham Bell.∗
For example:
P2/P1
power ratio (dB)

10lg 1=0
100
10lg 100=+20 (power gain)
1
10
10lg 1
10 =−10 (power loss or attenuation)
If logarithms to base e (i.e. natural or Napierian loga-
rithms) are used, then the ratio of two powers is said to
be in nepers (Np), i.e.
power ratio in nepers = 1
2 lnP2
P1
(5)
∗Who was Bell? For resume of Bell, see page 174. To ﬁnd out
more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
The neper is named after John Napier. ∗
Thus when the power ratio P2/P1 =5, the power
ratio in nepers= 1
2 ln5=0.805Np, and when the
power
ratio
P2/P1 =0.1,
the
power
ratio
in
nepers= 1
2 ln0.1=−1.15Np
The attenuation of ﬁlter sections and along a
transmission line are of an exponential form and it is
in such applications that the unit of the neper is used
(see Chapters 45 and 47).
If the powers P1 and P2 refer to power developed in
two equal resistors, R, then P1 =V 2
1 /R and P2 =V 2
2 /R.
Thus the ratio (from equation (4)) can be expressed by
the laws of logarithms as

In equations (4) to (9) the output-to-input ratio has
been used. However, the input-to-output ratio may also
be used. For example, in equation (6), the output-
to-input voltage ratio is expressed as 20lg(V2/V1)dB.
Alternatively, the input-to-output voltage ratio may be
expressed as 20lg(V1/V2)dB, the only difference in the
values obtained being a difference in sign.
If20lg(V2/V1)=10dB,say,then20lg(V1/V2)=−10dB.
Thus if an attenuator has a voltage input V1 of 50mV
and a voltage output V2 of 5mV, the voltage ratio V2/V1
is 5/50 or 1/10. Alternatively, this may be expressed as
‘an attenuation of 10’, i.e. V1/V2 =10.

The power ratios in (a), (b) and (c) represent power

ratio in (d) represents a power loss or attenuation, since
the ratio is a negative value.

44.4 Symmetrical T- and
π-attenuators
(a)
Symmetrical T-attenuator
As mentioned in Section 44.1, the ideal attenuator is
made up of pure resistances. A symmetrical T-padatten-
uator is shown in Figure 44.5 with a termination R0
connected as shown. From equation (1),
R0 = √(R2
1 + 2R1R2)
(10)
and from equation (2) R0 = √(ROCRSC)
(11)
With resistance R0 as the termination, the input resis-
tance of the pad will also be equal to R0. If the
terminating resistance R0 is transferred to port A then
the input resistance looking into port B will again be R0.
The pad is therefore symmetrical in impedance in
both directions of connection and may thus be inserted
into a network whose impedance is also R0. The value
of R0 is the characteristic impedance of the section.
As stated in Section 44.3, attenuation may be
expressed as a voltage ratio V1/V2 (see Figure 44.5) or
quoted in decibels as 20lg(V1/V2) or, alternatively, as a
power ratio as 10lg(P1/P2). If a T-section is symmetri-

impedances, then

attenuation. In Section 44.5, page 675, it is shown that,

for a matched network, i.e. one terminated in its charac-
teristic impedance, N is in fact the insertion loss ratio.
(Note that in an asymmetrical network, only the expres-
sion N =√(P1/P2) may be used – see Section 44.7 on

From equation (12) and also equation (10), it is possible
to derive expressions for R1 and R2 in terms of N and
R0, thus enabling an attenuator to be designed to give a
speciﬁed attenuation and to be matched symmetrically
into the network. From equation (12),
N(R0 −R1) = R0 + R1
NR0 −NR1 = R0 + R1

Thus if the characteristic impedance R0 and the

Figure 44.17(a) shows a generator E connected directly

across the load VL. z is the internal impedance of the

Figure 44.17(b) shows a two-port network connected
between the generator E and load ZL
The current through the load, shown as I2, and the
p.d. across the load, shown as V2, will generally be less
than current IL and voltage VL of Figure 44.17(a), as a
result of the insertion of the two-port network between
generator and load.

Figure 44.25(a) shows an asymmetrical T-pad section
where resistance R1 ̸=R3. Figure 44.25(b) shows an
asymmetrical π-section where R2 ̸=R3
When viewed from port A, in each of the sections, the
output impedance is ROB; when viewed from port B,
the input impedance is ROA. Since the sections are
asymmetrical ROA does not have the same value as ROB

rical π-section
Iterative impedance is the term used for the
impedance measured at one port of a two-port network
when the other port is terminated with an impedance
of the same value. For example, the impedance looking
into port 1 of Figure 44.26(a) is, say, 500 when port 2
is terminated in 500 and the impedance looking into
port 2 of Figure 44.26(b) is, say, 600 when port 1 is
terminated in 600. (In symmetric T- and π-sections
the two iterative impedances are equal, this value being
the characteristic impedance of the section.)
Figure 44.26
An image impedance is deﬁned as the impedance
which, when connected to the terminals of a network,
equals the impedance presented to it at the opposite
terminals. For example, the impedance looking into
port 1 of Figure 44.27(a) is, say, 400 when port 2 is
terminated in, say 750, and the impedance seen look-
ing into port 2 (Figure 44.27(b)) is 750 when port
1 is terminated in 400. An asymmetrical network is
correctly terminated when it is terminated in its image
impedance. (If the image impedances are equal, the
value is the characteristic impedance.)

The image impedance ROA seen at port 1 in
Figure 44.28 is given by equation (11):
ROA =√(ROC)(RSC),
where ROC and RSC refer to port 2 being
respectively open-circuited and short-circuited.
ROC = 200 + 100 = 300
and
RSC = 200 + (100)(300)
100 + 300 = 275
Hence ROA = √[(300)(275)] = 287.2
Similarly, ROB =√(ROC)(RSC), where ROC and
RSC refer to port 1 being respectively open-
circuited and short-circuited.
ROC = 300 + 100 = 400
and
RSC = 300 + (200)(100)
200+ 100 = 366.7
Hence
ROB = √[(400)(366.7)] = 383

where the impedance at port 1 with port 2 open-

ROC = (1000)(5000)
1000 + 5000 = 833
and the impedance at port 1, with port 2 short-
circuited,
RSC = (1000)(3000)
1000 + 3000 = 750
Hence ROA =√[(833)(750)]=790.
Similarly,
ROB =√(ROC)(RSC),
where
the
impedance at port 2 with port 1 open-circuited,
ROC = (2000)(4000)
2000+ 4000 = 1333
and the impedance at port 2 with port 1 short-
circuited,
RSC = (2000)(3000)
2000 + 3000 = 1200
Hence ROB =√[(1333)(1200)]=1265
Thus the image impedances are 790 and
1265.

44.8 Two-port networks in cascade
Often two-port networks are connected in cascade, i.e.
the output from the ﬁrst network becomes the input to
the second network, and so on,as shown inFigure 44.44.
Thus an attenuator may consist of several cascaded

Part 4

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Figure 44.44 Two-port networks connected in cascade
sections so as to achieve a particular desired overall
performance.
If the cascade is arranged so that the impedance
measured at one port and the impedance with which
the other port is terminated have the same value, then
each section (assuming they are symmetrical) will have
the same characteristic impedance Z0 and the last net-
work will be terminated in Z0. Thus each network will
have a matched termination and hence the attenuation
in decibels of section 1 in Figure 44.44 is given by
a1=20lg(V1/V2). Similarly, the attenuationof section 2
is given by a2 =20lg(V2/V3), and so on.
The overall attenuation is given by

by the laws of logarithms, i.e.
overall attenuation, a = a1 + a2 + ··· + an−1

Thus the overall attenuation is the sum of the attenua-
tions (in decibels) of the matched sections.
Problem 16.
Five identical attenuator sections are
connected in cascade. The overall attenuation is
70dB and the voltage input to the ﬁrst section is
20mV. Determine (a) the attenuation of each
individual attenuation section, (b) the voltage
output of the ﬁnal stage and (c) the voltage output
of the third stage.
(a)
From equation (27), the overall attenuation is
equal to the sum of the attenuations of the
individual sections and, since in this case each
section is identical, the attenuation of each
section=70/5=14dB.
(b)
If V1=the input voltage to the ﬁrst stage and
V0 =the output of the ﬁnal stage, then the overall
attenuation=20lg(V1/V0), i.e.

44.9 ABCD parameters
As mentioned earlier, a two-port network has a pair
of input terminals, shown as PQ in Figure 44.47, and
a pair of output terminals, shown as RS. When a volt-
age V1 is applied to terminals PQ, the input and output
currents, I1 and I2, ﬂow and an output voltage V2 is
produced. There are therefore four variable quantities
V1, I1, V2 and I2 for a two-port network. If the ele-
ments are assumed to be linear, then there are a number
of ways in which the relationships can be written. One
such method is termed ABCD parameters which we
consider in this chapter; there are others, however, such
as z-, y-, h- and g-parameters that are not considered
here.

For ABCD parameters, the input voltage V1 and the
input current I1 are speciﬁed in terms of the output
voltage V2 and current I2 as follows:
V1 = AV 2 −BI2
(28)
I1 = CV2 −DI2
(29)
A,B,C and D are constants for a particular network
and called parameters.
In equation (28),
when I2 = 0, then: A = V1
V2
and
when V2 = 0, then: B = −V1
I2
In equation (29),
when I2 = 0, then: C = I1
V2
and
when V2 = 0, then: D = −I1
I2
Since A and D are ratios, they have no units, while
B is an impedance in ohms, and C an admittance in
siemens.
These parameters are often called the general cir-
cuit or transmission parameters and are generally
used for the analysis of two-port networks which are
heavy current circuits or power frequency transmission
lines.

A=2+j, B =5, C =(1+j2)S and D =4. If the
output is a current of 80mA through a 20
resistive load, determine (a) the input voltage and
(b) the input current.
Since I2 =80mA and R2 =20 then
V2 =I2R2 =80×10−3×20=1.6V
(a)
From equation (28), voltage,
V1 = AV2 −BI2
= (2 + j)(1.6) −(5)(80× 10−3)
= 3.2 + j1.6 −0.4 = 2.8 + j1.6
i.e. V1 = 3.22∠∠∠29.74◦V
(b)
From equation (29), current,
I1 = CV2 −DI2
= (1 + j2)(1.6) −(4)(80× 10−3)

following transmission parameters: A=5,

(a)
From equation (28), voltage, V1 =AV 2 −BI2
When the output is open-circuited, I2 =0 and
V1 =AV2

Passive networks and reciprocity theorem
As stated earlier, the ABCD parameters for a two-port
network are:
V1 = AV 2 −BI2
(28)
I1 = CV2 −DI2
(29)
Figure 44.49(a) represents a two-port network whose
terminals RS are short-circuited with an input voltage V
across terminals PQ. Then V2 in the above equations is
zero and the equations become:
V = −BI2

I1 = −DI2

Figure 44.49(b) represents a two-port network whose

age V now applied across terminals RS, then V1 in
equation (28) is zero and the above equations become:
0 = AV −BI′

Substituting V =−BI2 from equation (31) gives:

B

i.e.
I′
1 = (AD −BC)I2
This is a theorem called thereciprocity theorem, which
states that if a voltage is applied to a linear passive net-
work at one terminal and produces a current at another,
then the same voltage applied to a second terminal will
produce the same current at the ﬁrst terminal.
Since the same voltage has been applied at each of the
two terminals, then I ′
1 =I2
Thus, AD −BC =1
(35)
This condition must be satisﬁed by any linear passive
network.
Problem 22.
Tests on a passive two-port network
gave the following results:
Output open-circuited:
V1=20V, V2 =10V, I1 =0.5A
Output short-circuited:
V1=20V, I1 =1A, I2 =1A
(a) Determine the values of the ABCD parameters
and (b) conﬁrm that the network is passive.
(a)
From equation (28),
V1 =AV 2 −BI2
When the output is open-circuit,
V1=AV 2
since I2 =0
Since V1 =20V and V2 =10V, then 20=A(10)
from which, A=2
From equation (29),
I1 =CV2 −DI2

Part 4
Attenuators
689
When the output is open-circuit,
I1 =CV2
since I2 =0
Since V2 =10V and I1 =0.5A, then 0.5=C(10)
from which, C = 0.5
10 =0.05S
From equation (28),
V1 =AV2 −BI2
When the output is short-circuit,
V1 =−BI2
since V2 =0
SinceV1=20VandI2=−1A,then20=−B(−1)
from which, B=20
From equation (29),
I1 =CV2 −DI2
When the output is short-circuit,
I1 =−DI2
since V2 =0
Since I1 =1A and I2 =−1A, then 1=−D(−1)
from which, D =1
(b)
For passive network, AD−BC =1 from equa-
tion (35)
Thus, when A=2, B =20, C =0.05 and D =1:
AD −BC = (2)(1) −(20)(0.05) = 2 −1 = 1
Hence the network is passive.

Chapter 45
Filter networks
Why it is important to understand: Filter networks
In circuit theory, a ﬁlter is an electrical network that alters the amplitude and/or phase characteristics
of a signal with respect to frequency. Ideally, a ﬁlter will not add new frequencies to the input signal,
nor will it change the component frequencies of that signal, but it will change the relative amplitudes of
the various frequency components and/or their phase relationships. Filters are often used in electronic
systems to emphasize signals in certain frequency ranges and reject signals in other frequency ranges.
Electronic ﬁlters are electronic circuits which perform signal processing functions, speciﬁcally to remove
unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Filters are used in
electronic music to alter the harmonic content of a signal, which changes its timbre. Many of the ﬁlters
used in synthesizers are voltage-controlled ﬁlters, which allows the ﬁlter to be controlled by a signal
generated elsewhere in the synthesizer. The purpose of ﬁlters and an explanation of the various types of
ﬁlter is given in this chapter, including the design of ‘m-derived’ ﬁlter sections.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
appreciate the purpose of a ﬁlter network
•
understand basic types of ﬁlter sections, i.e. low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop ﬁlters
•
understand characteristic impedance and attenuation of ﬁlter sections
•
understand low and high pass ladder networks
•
design a low- and high-pass ﬁlter section
•
calculate propagation coefﬁcient and time delay in ﬁlter sections
•
understand and design ‘m-derived’ ﬁlter sections
•
understand and design practical composite ﬁlters
45.1 Introduction
A ﬁlter is a network designed to pass signals having fre-
quencies within certain bands (called pass-bands) with
little attenuation, but greatly attenuates signals within
other bands (called attenuation bands or stop-bands).
As explained in the previous chapter, an attenua-
tor network pad is composed of resistances only, the
attenuation resulting being constant and independent
of frequency. However, a ﬁlter is frequency sensitive
and is thus composed of reactive elements. Since cer-
tain frequencies are to be passed with minimal loss,
ideally the inductors and capacitors need to be pure

components since the presence of resistance results in
some attenuation at all frequencies.
Between the passband of a ﬁlter, where ideally the
attenuation is zero, and the attenuation band, where ide-
ally the attenuation is inﬁnite, is the cut-off frequency,
this being the frequency at which the attenuation
changes from zero to some ﬁnite value.
A ﬁlter network containing no source of power is termed
passive, and one containing one or more power sources
is known as an active ﬁlter network.
The ﬁlters considered in this chapter are symmetrical
unbalanced T and π sections, the reactances used being
considered as ideal.
Filters are used for a variety of purposes in nearly
every type of electronic communications and control
equipment. The bandwidths of ﬁlters used in communi-
cations systems vary from a fraction of a hertz to many
megahertz, depending on the application.
45.2 Basic types of ﬁlter sections
(a)
Low-pass ﬁlters
Figure 45.1 shows simple unbalanced T and π section
ﬁlters using series inductors and shunt capacitors. If
either section is connected into a network and a con-
tinuously increasing frequency is applied, each would
have a frequency-attenuation characteristic as shown
in Figure 45.2(a). This is an ideal characteristic and
assumespurereactiveelements.Allfrequenciesareseen
to be passed from zero up to a certain value without
attenuation, this value being shown as fc, the cut-off
frequency; all values of frequency above fc are atten-
uated. It is for this reason that the networks shown in
Figures 45.1(a) and (b) are known as low-pass ﬁlters.
The electrical circuit diagram symbol for a low-pass
ﬁlter is shown in Figure 45.2(b).
(b)
(a)
Figure 45.1
Summarizing, a low-pass ﬁlter is one designed to
pass signals at frequencies below a speciﬁed cut-off
frequency.
When rectiﬁers are used to produce the d.c. supplies
of electronic systems, a large ripple introduces undesir-
able noise and may even mask the effect of the signal

voltage. Low-pass ﬁlters are added to smooth the output
voltage waveform, this being one of the most common
applications of ﬁlters in electrical circuits.
Filters are employed to isolate various sections of a
complete system and thus to prevent undesired inter-
actions. For example, the insertion of low-pass decou-
pling ﬁlters between each of several ampliﬁer stages and
a common power supply reduces interaction due to the
common power supply impedance.
(b)
High-pass ﬁlters
Figure 45.3 shows simple unbalanced T and π section
ﬁlters using series capacitors and shunt inductors. If
either section is connected into a network and a con-
tinuously increasing frequency is applied, each would
have a frequency-attenuation characteristic as shown in
Figure 45.4(a).
Once again this is an ideal characteristic assuming
purereactiveelements.Allfrequenciesbelowthecut-off
frequency fc are seen to be attenuated and all fre-
quencies above fc are passed without loss. It is for
this reason that the networks shown in Figures 45.3(a)
and (b) are known as high-pass ﬁlters. The electrical
circuit-diagram symbol for a high-pass ﬁlter is shown
in Figure 45.4(b).
Summarizing, a high-pass ﬁlter is one designed to
pass signals at frequencies above a speciﬁed cut-off
frequency.

The characteristics shown in Figures 45.2(a) and
45.4(a) are ideal in that they have assumed that there is
no attenuation at all in the passbands and inﬁnite attenu-
ation in the attenuation bands. Both of these conditions
are impossible to achieve in practice. Due to resistance,
mainly in the inductive elements, the attenuation in the
passbandwill not be zero,and in a practical ﬁlter section
the attenuation in the attenuation band will have a ﬁnite
value. Practical characteristics for low-pass and high-
pass ﬁlters are discussed in Sections 45.5 and 45.6. In
addition to the resistive loss there is often an added loss
due to mismatching. Ideally, when a ﬁlter is inserted
into a network it is matched to the impedance of that
network. However, the characteristic impedance of a
ﬁlter section will vary with frequency and the termi-
nation of the section may be an impedance that does
not vary with frequency in the same way. To minimize
lossesduetoresistanceandmismatching,ﬁltersareused
under image impedance conditions as far as possible
(see Chapter 44).
(c)
Band-pass ﬁlters
A band-pass ﬁlter is one designed to pass signals with
frequencies between two speciﬁed cut-off frequencies.
The characteristic of an ideal band-pass ﬁlter is shown
in Figure 45.5.
Such a ﬁlter may be formed by cascading a high-pass
and a low-pass ﬁlter. fCH is the cut-off frequency of the
high-pass ﬁlter and fCL is the cut-off frequency of the
low-pass ﬁlter. As can be seen, fCL >fCH for a band-
pass ﬁlter, the passband being given by the difference
between these values. The electrical circuit diagram
symbol for a band-pass ﬁlter is shown in Figure 45.6.
Crystal and ceramic devices are used extensively as
band-pass ﬁlters. They are common in the intermediate-
frequency ampliﬁers of vhf radios where a precisely-
deﬁned bandwidth must be maintained for good
performance.

Band-stop ﬁlters
A band-stopﬁlter is one designedto pass signals with all
frequencies except those between two speciﬁed cut-off
frequencies. The characteristic of an ideal band-stop ﬁl-
ter is shown in Figure 45.7. Such a ﬁlter may be formed
by connecting a high-pass and a low-pass ﬁlter in par-
allel. As can be seen, for a band-stop ﬁlter fCH >fCL,
the stop-band being given by the difference between
these values. The electrical circuit diagram symbol for
a band-stop ﬁlter is shown in Figure 45.8.

Sometimes, as in the case of interference from 50Hz
power lines in an audio system, the exact frequency of
a spurious noise signal is known. Usually such interfer-
ence is from an odd harmonic of 50Hz, for example,
250Hz. A sharply tuned band-stop ﬁlter, designed to
attenuatethe250Hznoisesignal,isusedtominimizethe
effect of the output. A high-pass ﬁlter with cut-off fre-
quencygreaterthan 250Hzwould also removethe inter-
ference, but some of the lower frequency components
of the audio signal would be lost as well.
45.3
The characteristic impedance
and the attenuation of ﬁlter
sections
Nature of the input impedance
Let a symmetrical ﬁlter section be terminated in an
impedance ZO. If the input impedance also has a value
of ZO, then ZO is the characteristic impedance of the
section.
Figure 45.9 shows a T section composed of reactive
elements XA and XB. If the reactances are of opposite
kind, then the input impedance of the section, shown
as ZO, when the output port is open or short-circuited,
can be either inductive or capacitive depending on the
frequency of the input signal.
For example, if XA is inductive, say jXL, and XB is
capacitive, say, −jXC, then from Figure 45.9,
ZOC = jXL −jXC = j(XL −XC)
and
ZSC = jXL +
( jXL)(−jXC)

Since XL =2πfL and XC =(1/2πfC) then ZOC and ZSC
can be inductive (i.e. positive reactance) or capacitive
(i.e. negative reactance) depending on the value of
frequency, f
Let the magnitude of the reactance on open-circuit
be XOC and the magnitude of the reactance on short-
circuit be XSC. Since the ﬁlter elements are all purely
reactive they may be expressed as jX OC or jXSC, where
XOC and XSC are real, beingpositive or negativein sign.
Four combinations of ZOC and ZSC are possible, these
being:
(i) ZOC =+jXOC and ZSC =−jXSC
(ii) ZOC =−jXOC and ZSC =+jXSC
(iii) ZOC =+jXOC and ZSC =+jXSC
and
(iv) ZOC =−jXOC and ZSC =−jXSC
From general circuit theory, input impedance Z O is
given by:
ZO = √(ZOCZSC)
Taking either of combinations (i) and (ii) above gives:
ZO = √(−j2XOCXSC) = √(XOCXSC),
which is real, thus the input impedance will be purely
resistive.
Taking either of combinations(iii) and (iv) abovegives:
ZO = √( j2XOCXSC) = +j√(XOCXSC),
which is imaginary, thus the input impedance will be
purely reactive.
Thus since the magnitude and nature of ZOC and ZSC
depend upon frequency then so also will the magnitude
and nature of the input impedance ZO depend upon
frequency.

Part 4

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
From equation (2), page 668, the characteristic impe-
dance is given by ZO =√(ZOCZSC).
The following statements may be demonstrated to be
true for any ﬁlter:
(a)
The attenuation is zero throughout the frequency
range for which the characteristic impedance is
purely resistive.
(b)
The attenuation is ﬁnite throughout the frequency
range for which the characteristic impedance is
purely reactive.
To demonstrate statement (a) above:
Let the ﬁlter shown in Figure 45.10 be operating over a
range of frequencies such that ZO is purely resistive.
From Figure 45.10, ZO = V1
I1
= V2
I2
Power dissipated in the output termination,
P2 =V2I2 cosφ2=V2I2 (since φ2 =0 with a purely
resistive load).
Power delivered at the input terminals,
P1 = V1I1 cosφ1 = V1I1 (since φ1 = 0)
No power is absorbed by the ﬁlter elements since they
are purely reactive.
Hence P2 =P1, V2 =V1 and I2 =I1
Thus if the ﬁlter is terminated in ZO and operating in a
frequencyrangesuch that ZO is purelyresistive, then all
the power delivered to the input is passed to the output
and there is therefore no attenuation.
To demonstrate statement (b) above:
Let the ﬁlter be operating over a range of frequencies
such that ZO is purely reactive.
Then, from Figure 45.10, V1
I1
=jZO = V2
I2
Thus voltage and current are at 90◦to each other
which means that the circuit can neither accept nor
deliver any active power from the source to the load
(P =VI cosφ =VI cos90◦=VI(0)=0). There is there-
fore inﬁnite attenuation, theoretically. (In practice, the
attenuation is ﬁnite, for the condition (V1/I1)=(V2/I2)
can hold for V2 <V1 and I2 <I1, since the voltage and
current are 90◦out of phase.)
Statements (a) and (b) above are important because
they can be applied to determine the cut-off frequency
point of any ﬁlter section simply from a knowledge of
the nature of ZO. In the pass band, ZO is real, and in
theattenuationband,ZO isimaginary.Thecut-offfre-
quency is therefore at the point on the frequencyscale at
which ZO changes from a real quantity to an imaginary
one, or vice versa (see Sections 45.5 and 45.6).
45.4 Ladder networks
Low-pass networks
Figure 45.11 shows a low-pass network arranged as a
ladder or repetitive network. Such a network may be
considered as a number of T or π sections in cascade.
In Figure 45.12(a), a T section may be taken from the
ladder by removing ABED, producing the low-pass ﬁl-
ter section shown in Figure 45.13(a). The ladder has
been cut in the centre of each of its inductive ele-
ments hence giving L/2 as the series arm elements in
Figure 45.13(a).

Similarly, a π section may be taken from the ladder
shown in Figure 45.12(a) by removing FGJH, produc-
ing the low-pass ﬁlter section shown in Figure 45.13(b).
The shunt element C in Figure 45.12(a) may be regarded
as two capacitors in parallel, each of value C/2 as shown
in the part of the ladder redrawn in Figure 45.12(b).

The ladder network of Figure 45.11 can thus either be
considered to be a number of the T networks shown in
Figure 45.13(a) connected in cascade, or a number of
the π networks shown in Figure 45.13(b) connected in
cascade.
It is shown in Section 47.3, page 748, that an inﬁnite
transmission line may be reduced to a repetitive low-
pass ﬁlter network.

Note that the series arm elements are each 2C. This is
because two capacitors each of value 2C connected in

Similarly, a π section may be taken from the ladder

the high-pass ﬁlter section shown in Figure 45.16(b).
The shunt element L in Figure 45.15(a) may be regarded
as two inductors in parallel, each of value 2L as shown

From equations (1) and (4) it is seen that the charac-
teristic impedance Z0 varies with ω, i.e. Z0 varies with
frequency. Thus if the nominal impedance is made to
equal the load impedanceinto which the ﬁlter feeds then
the matching deteriorates as the frequency increases
fromzero towards fc. It is, however,conventionto make
the terminating impedance equal to the value of Z 0 well
within the passband, i.e. to take the limiting value of Z0
asthefrequencyapproacheszero.Thislimitisobviously
√(L/C). This means that the ﬁlter is properly terminated
at very low frequency but as the cut-off frequency is
approached becomes increasingly mismatched. This is
shown for a low-pass section in Figure 45.20 by curve
(a). It is seen that an increasing loss is introduced into
the passband. Curve (b) shows the attenuation due to
the same low-pass section being correctly terminated
at all frequencies. A curve lying somewhere between
curves (a) and (b) will usually result for each section if
several sections are cascaded and terminated in R0, or
if a matching section is inserted between the low-pass
section and the load.

series and shunt impedances.
From the low-pass sections shown in Figures 45.17

From equations (9) and (10),

0 = constant (k).
A ladder network composed of reactances, the series
reactances being of opposite sign to the shunt reac-
tances (as in Figure 45.23) are called ‘constant-k’ ﬁlter
sections. Positive (i.e. inductive) reactance is directly
proportional to frequency, and negative (i.e. capacitive)
reactance is inversely proportional to frequency. Thus
the product of the series and shunt reactances is inde-
pendent of frequency (see equations (9) and (10)). The
constancy of this product has given this type of ﬁlter
its name.
From equation (10), it is seen that Z0T and Z0π
will either be both real or both imaginary together
(since j 2 = −1). Also, when Z0T changes from real
to imaginary at the cut-off frequency, so will Z0π. The
two sections shown in Figures 45.17 and 45.18 will thus
have identical cut-off frequencies and thus identical
passbands. Constant-k sections of any kind of ﬁlter are
known as prototypes.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
At the cut-off frequency, fc, ω=ωc
and from equation (11), Z0T falls to zero,
and from equation (12), Z0π rises to inﬁnity.
These results are shown graphically in Figure 45.24,
where it is seen that Z0T decreases from R0 at zero
frequency to zero at the cut-off frequency; Z 0π rises
from its initial value of R0 to inﬁnity at fc
(At a frequency, f = 0.95fc, for example,

produces a much sharper cut-off characteristic, although
the attenuation in the passband is increased a little.

extremely small and may be neglected.
The characteristic impedance then becomes equal to
√(L/C), this being the nominal impedance. Thus for
a high-pass ﬁlter section the nominal impedance R0 is
given by:
R0 =

(See Section 44.3, page 668, on logarithmic units.)
Unless Sections A, B and C in Figure45.35are purely
resistive there will be a phase change in each section.
Thus the ratio of the current entering a section to that
leaving it will be a phasor quantity having both modulus
and argument. The propagation constant which has no
units is a complex quantity given by:
γ =α +jβ
(24)
where α is called the attenuation coefﬁcient, measured
in nepers, and β the phase shift coefﬁcient, measured
in radians. β is the angle by which a current leaving a
section lags behind the current entering it.

Variation in phase angle in the passband
of a ﬁlter
In practice, the low- and high-pass ﬁlter sections dis-
cussed in Sections 45.5 and 45.6 would possess a phase
shift between the input and output voltages which varies
considerably over the range of frequency comprising the
passband.
Let the low-pass prototype T section shown in
Figure 45.37 be terminated as shown in its nominal
impedance R0. The input impedance for frequencies
much less than the cut-off frequency is thus also equal
to R0 and is resistive. The phasor diagram representing
Figure 45.37 is shown in Figure 45.38 and is produced
as follows:

in practice this is only usually valid up to a frequency of
about 0.7fc for a low-pass ﬁlter and a typical characteri-
stic is shown in Figure 45.39. At the cut-off frequency,
β =π rad. For frequencies within the attenuation band,
the phase shift is unimportant, since all voltages having

Time delay
The change of phase that occurs in a ﬁlter section
depends on the time the signal takes to pass through
the section. The phase shift β may be expressed as a
time delay. If the frequency of the signal is f then the
periodic time is (1/f ) seconds.
Hence the time delay = β
2π × 1
f = β
ω
From equation (27), β =ω√(LC). Thus
time delay = ω√(LC)
ω
= √(LC)
(28)
when angle β is small.
Equation (28) shows that the time delay, or tran-
sit time, is independent of frequency. Thus a phase
shift which is proportional to frequency (equation (27))
results in a time delay which is independent of fre-
quency. Hence if the input to the ﬁlter section consists
of a complex wave composed of several harmonic com-
ponents of differing frequency, the output will consist
of a complex wave made up of the sum of correspond-
ing components all delayed by the same amount. There
will therefore be no phase distortion due to varying time
delays for the separate frequency components.
In practice, however, phase shift β tends not to be
constant and the increase in time delay with rising fre-
quency causes distortion of non-sinusoidal inputs, this
distortion being superimposed on that due to the attenu-
ation of components whose frequency is higher than the
cut-off frequency.
At the cut-off frequency of a prototype low-pass ﬁlter,
the phase angle β =π rad. Hence the time delay of a
signal through such a section at the cut-off frequency is
given by

Problem 13.
A ﬁlter network comprising n
identical sections passes signals of all frequencies
up to 500kHz and provides a total delay of 9.55μs.
If the nominal impedance of the circuit into which
the ﬁlter is inserted is 1k, determine (a) the values
of the elements in each section and (b) the value
of n.
Cut-off frequency, fc =500×103 Hz and nominal
impedance R0 =1000.
Since the ﬁlter passes frequencies up to 500kHz then it
is a low-pass ﬁlter.

and inductance, L = R0

π(500 × 103)

Thus if the section is a low-pass T section
then the inductance in each series arm will be
(L/2)=318.3μH and the capacitance in the shunt
arm will be 636.6pF
If the section is a low-pass π section then the
inductance in the series arm will be 636.6μH
and the capacitance in each shunt arm will be
(C/2)=318.3pF
(b)
From equation (28), the time delay for a single
section
= √(LC) = √[(636.6 × 10−6)(636.6 × 10−12)]
= 0.6366μs
For a time delay of 9.55μs therefore, the number
of cascaded sections required is given by
9.55
0.6366 = 15, i.e. n = 15
Problem 14.
A ﬁlter network consists of 8

of 1k. If the total delay time is 4μs, determine
the component values for each section if the ﬁlter

π network.
Since the total delay time is 4μs then the delay time of
each of the 8 sections is 4

45.8 ’m-derived’ ﬁlter sections
(a)
General
In a low-pass ﬁlter a clearly deﬁned cut-off frequency
followed by a high attenuation is needed; in a high-pass
ﬁlter, high attenuationfollowed by a clearly deﬁned cut-
off frequency is needed. It is not practicable to obtain
either of these conditions by wiring appropriate pro-
totype constant-k sections in cascade. An equivalent
section is therefore required having:
(i)
the same cut-off frequency as the prototype but
with a rapid rise in attenuation beyond cut-off for
a low-pass type or a rapid decrease at cut-off from
a high attenuation for the high-pass type,
(ii)
the same value of nominal impedance R0 as the
prototype at all frequencies (otherwise the two
forms could not be connected together without
mismatch).
If the two sections, i.e. the prototype and the equiva-
lent section, have the same value of R0 they will have
identical passbands.
The equivalent section is called an ‘m-derived’ ﬁl-
ter section (for reasons as explained below) and is one
whichgivesasharpercut-offattheedgesofthepassband
and a better impedance characteristic.
(b)
T sections
A prototype T section is shown in Figure 45.44(a). Let
a new section be constructed from this section having a
series arm of the same type but of different value, say
mZ1, where m is some constant. (It is for this reason
that the new equivalent section is called an ‘m-derived’
section.) If the characteristic impedance Z0T of the two
sections is to be the same then the value of the shunt
arm impedance will have to be different to Z2. Let this
be Z′
2 as shown in Figure 45.44(b).

Thus impedance Z′
2 consists of an impedance Z2/m in
series with an impedance Z1((1−m2)/4m). An addi-
tional component has therefore been introduced into the
shunt arm of the m-derived section. The value of m can
range from 0 to 1, and when m=1, the prototype and
the m-derived sections are identical.
(c)
π sections
A prototype π section is shown in Figure 45.45(a). Let
a new section be constructed having shunt arms of the
same type but of different values, say Z2/m, where m is
some constant. If the characteristic impedance Z0π of
the two sections is to be the same then the value of the
series arm impedance will have to be different to Z1.
Let this be Z′
1 as shown in Figure 45.45(b).
The value of Z′
1 is determined as follows:
From equation (9), Z0T Z0π =Z1Z2

45.9 Practical composite ﬁlters
In practice, ﬁlters to meet a given speciﬁcation often
have to comprisea numberof basic networks.For exam-
ple, a practical arrangement might consist of (i) a basic
prototype, in series with (ii) an ‘m-derived’ section,
with (iii) terminating half-sections at each end. The ‘m-
derived’ section improves the attenuation immediately
aftercut-off,theprototypeimprovestheattenuationwell
after cut-off, whilst the terminating half-sections are
used to obtain a constant match over the pass-band.
Figure 45.53(a) shows an ‘m-derived’ low-pass T
section, and Figure 45.53(b) shows the same section cut
into two halves through AB, each of the two halves being
termed a ‘half-section’. The ‘m-derived’ half section
also improves the steepness of attenuation outside the
pass-band.

Figure 45.53
As shown in Section 45.8, the ‘m-derived’ ﬁlter
section is based on a prototype which presents its own
characteristic impedance at its terminals. Hence, for
example, the prototype of a T section leads to an ‘m-
derived’ T section and Z0T =Z0T (m) where Z0T is the
characteristic impedance of the prototype and Z0T (m) is
the characteristic impedance of the ‘m-derived’section.
It is shown in Figure 45.24 that Z0T has a non-linear
characteristic against frequency; thus Z0T (m) will also
be non-linear.
Since from equation (9) Z0π =(Z1Z2/Z0T ), then the

as shown in Figure 45.24. Further characteristics may

It is seen from Figure 45.54 that when m=0.6 the
impedance is practically constant at R0 for most of
the passband. In a composite ﬁlter, ‘m-derived’ half-
sections having a value of m=0.6 are usually used at
each end to provide a good match to a resistive source
and load over the passband.

m on the frequency of inﬁnite attenuation is shown in
Figure 45.55, although the ideal curves shown would be
modiﬁed a little in practice by resistance losses.
Problem 17.
It is required to design a composite
ﬁlter with a cut-off frequency of 10kHz, a
frequency of inﬁnite attenuation of 11.8kHz and
nominal impedance of 600. Determine the
component values needed if the ﬁlter is to comprise
a prototype T section, an ‘m-derived’ T section and
two terminating ‘m-derived’ half-sections.
R0 =600, fc =10kHz and f∞=11.8kHz. Since
fc< f∞the ﬁlter is a low-pass T section.

Magnetically coupled circuits
Why it is important to understand: Magnetically coupled circuits
Magnetically coupled electric circuits are central to the operation of transformers and electric machines.
In the case of transformers, stationary circuits are magnetically coupled for the purpose of changing the
voltage and current levels. In the case of electric machines, circuits in relative motion are magnetically
coupled for the purpose of transferring energy between mechanical and electrical systems. Because
magnetically coupled circuits play such an important role in power transmission and conversion, it is
important to establish the equations that describe their behaviour and to express these equations in a
form convenient for analysis. This chapter reviews self and mutual inductance and performs calculations
on mutually coupled circuits and describes and uses the dot rule in coupled circuit problems.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
deﬁne mutual inductance

46.1 Introduction
When the interaction between two loops of a circuit
takes place through a magnetic ﬁeld instead of through
common elements, the loops are said to be inductively
or magnetically coupled. The windings of a trans-
former, for example, are magnetically coupled (see
Chapter 23).

magnetic induction, an e.m.f. in the other. An ideal

where E2 is the e.m.f. in circuit 2 due to current I1 in

(a) the self inductance of coil x and (b) the

46.4 Coupling coefﬁcient
The coupling coefﬁcient k is the degree or fraction of
magnetic coupling that occurs between circuits.
k = ﬂux linking two circuits
total ﬂux produced
When there is no magnetic coupling, k = 0. If the mag-
netic coupling is perfect, i.e. all the ﬂux produced in
the primary links with the secondary then k = 1. Coup-
ling coefﬁcient is used in communications engineering
to denote the degree of coupling between two coils. If
the coils are close together, most of the ﬂux produced
by current in one coil passes through the other, and the
coils are termed tightly coupled. If the coils are spaced
apart, only a part of the ﬂux links with the second, and
the coils are termed loosely coupled.
From Section 46.2, the inductance of a coil is given by

46.5 Coils connected in series
Figure 46.2 shows two coils, 1 and 2, wound on an
insulating core with terminals B and C joined. The
ﬂuxes in each coil produced by current i are in the
same direction and the coils are termed cumulatively
coupled.
Let the self inductance of coil 1 be L1 and that of
coil 2 be L2 and let their mutual inductance be M
If in dt seconds, the current increases by di amperes
then the e.m.f. induced in coil 1 due to its self inductance
is L1(di/dt) volts, and the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 due
to its self inductance is L2(di/dt) volts. Also, the e.m.f.
induced in coil 1 due to the increase of current in coil 2
is M(di/dt) volts and the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 due to
the increase of current in coil 1 is M(di/dt)
Hence the total e.m.f. induced in coils 1 and 2 is:

If the windingbetween terminals A and D in Figure 46.2

circuit is LA(di/dt) volts.
Hence

If terminals B and D are joined as shown in Figure 46.3

The e.m.f. M(di/dt) induced in coil 1 due to an increase
di amperes in dt seconds in coil 2 is in the same direc-
tion as the current and is hence in opposition to the
e.m.f. induced in coil 1 due to its self inductance. Simi-
larly, the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 by mutual inductance
is in opposition to that induced by the self inductance
of coil 2.

Thus the total inductance L of inductively coupled

Equation (11) −equation (12) gives:

An experimental method of determining the mutual
inductance is indicated by equation (14), i.e. connect
the coils both ways and determine the equivalent induc-

inductance is then given by a quarter of the difference
between the two values of inductance.

From equation (13), total inductance,

Hence
60 = 40 + 10±2M
Since(L1 + L2)<L then 60 = 40 + 10 + 2M

Problem 7.
Two coils are connected in series and
their effective inductance is found to be 15mH.
When the connection to one coil is reversed, the
effective inductance is found to be 10mH. If the
coefﬁcient of coupling is 0.7, determine (a) the self
inductance of each coil and (b) the mutual
inductance.
(a)
From equation (13),
total inductance, L = L1+L2 ±2M
and from equation (9), M = k√(L1L2)
hence L = L1 + L2 ±2k√(L1L2)
Since in equation (11),
LA = 15mH, 15 = L1 + L2 + 2k√(L1L2)
(15)
and since in equation (12),
LB = 10mH, 10 = L1 + L2 −2k√(L1L2)
(16)
Equation (15) + equation (16) gives:
25 = 2L1 + 2L2 and 12.5 = L1 + L2
(17)
From equation (17), L2 = 12.5 −L1
Substituting in equation (15), gives:
15 = L1 + (12.5 −L1)

Using the quadratic formula:

i.e. L1 = 12.5 ± (11.98)

From equation (17):

The magnitude of the secondary e.m.f. E2in Figure 46.5
is given by:
E2 = M dI1
dt , from equation (1)
If the current I1 is sinusoidal, i.e. I1 = I1m sinωt
then E2 = M d
dt (I1m sinωt) = MωI1m cosωt
Since cosωt = sin(ωt + 90◦) then cos ωt = j sinωt in
complex form.
Hence E2 = MωI1m(j sinωt) = jωM(I1m sinωt)
i.e.
E2 = jωMI1
(18)
If L1 is the self inductance of the primary winding in
Figure 46.5, there will be an e.m.f. generated equal to
jωL1I1 induced into the primary winding since the ﬂux
set up by the primary current also links with the primary
winding.

E1 = I1(R1 + jωL1) ± jωMI2
and 0 = I2(R2 + RL + jωL2) ± jωMI1
In these equations the ‘M’ terms have been written as
± because it is not possible to state whether the magne-
tomotive forces due to currents I1 and I2 are added or
subtracted. To make this clearer a dot notation is used
whereby the polarity of the induced e.m.f. due to mutual
inductance is identiﬁed by placing a dot on the diagram
adjacent to that end of each equivalent winding which
bears the same relationship to the magnetic ﬂux.
The dot rule determines the sign of the voltage of
mutual inductance in the Kirchhoff’s law equations
shown above, and states:
(i)
when both currents enter, or both currents leave,
a pair of coupled coils at the dotted terminals, the
signs of the ‘M’ terms will be the same as the signs
of the ‘L’ terms, or

when one current enters at a dotted terminal and
one leaves by a dotted terminal, the signs of the
‘M’ terms are opposite to the signs of the ‘L’ terms.
Thus Figure 46.18 shows two cases in which the signs
of M and L are the same, and Figure 46.19 shows two
cases where the signs of M and L are opposite.In Figure

The position of the dots and the current directions

the M and L terms are opposite. Applying Kirchhoff’s
voltage law to the primary circuit gives:
250∠0◦= (10 + j50)I1 −j10I2

and applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the secondary
circuit gives:
0 = (10 + 50 + j50)I2 −j10I1

Transmission lines
Why it is important to understand: Transmission lines
As the name implies, a transmission line is a set of conductors used for transmitting electrical signals.
Coaxial cable and twisted pair cable are examples. In general, every connection in an electric circuit is
a transmission line. In a simple transmission line, a source provides a signal that must reach a load. In
basic circuit theory, it is assumed that the wires that make up the transmission line are ideal and hence
that the voltage at all points on the wires is exactly the same. In reality, this situation is never quite true.
Any real wire has series resistance, R, and inductance, L. Additionally, a capacitance, C, exists between
any pair of real wires. Moreover, because all dielectrics exhibit some leakage, a small conductance, G, (i.e.
a high shunt resistance) exists between the two wires. Understanding transmission lines is an important
part of the art of radio – the proper selection and use of a feed line is often more important than the
choice of radio. In this chapter the purpose of transmission lines is explained, as are the current and
voltage relationships; calculations involving the characteristic impedance and propagation coefﬁcient,
distortion, wave reﬂection and standing waves are also explored.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
appreciate the purpose of a transmission line
•
deﬁne the transmission line primary constants R, L, C and G
•
calculate phase delay, wavelength and velocity of propagation on a transmission line
•
appreciate current and voltage relationships on a transmission line
•
deﬁne the transmission line secondary line constants Z0, γ , α and β
•
calculate characteristic impedance and propagation coefﬁcient in terms of the primary line constants
•
understand and calculate distortion on transmission lines
•
understand wave reﬂection and calculate reﬂection coefﬁcient
•
understand standing waves and calculate standing wave ratio
47.1 Introduction
Atransmissionlineisasystemofconductorsconnecting
one point to another and along which electromagnetic
energy can be sent. Thus telephone lines and power
distribution lines are typical examples of transmission
lines; in electronics, however, the term usually implies
a line used for the transmission of radio-frequency (r.f.)
energy such as that from a radio transmitter to the
antenna.
An important feature of a transmission line is that it
should guide energy from a source at the sending end
to a load at the receiving end without loss by radiation.

Part 4
Transmission lines
747
One form of construction often used consists of two
similar conductors mounted close together at a constant
separation. The two conductors form the two sides of
a balanced circuit and any radiation from one of them
is neutralized by that from the other. Such twin-wire
lines are used for carrying high r.f. power, for exam-
ple, at transmitters. The coaxial form of construction is
commonly employed for low power use, one conduc-
tor being in the form of a cylinder which surrounds the
other at its centre, and thus acts as a screen. Such cables
are often used to couple f.m. and television receivers to
their antennas.
At frequencies greater than 1000MHz, transmission
lines are usually in the form of a waveguide which may
be regarded as coaxial lines without the centre con-
ductor, the energy being launched into the guide or
abstracted from it by probes or loops projecting into
the guide.
47.2 Transmission line primary
constants
Let an a.c. generator be connected to the input termi-
nals of a pair of parallel conductors of inﬁnite length.
A sinusoidal wave will move along the line and a ﬁnite
current will ﬂow into the line. The variation of voltage
with distance along the line will resemble the varia-
tion of applied voltage with time. The moving wave,
sinusoidal in this case, is called a voltage travelling
wave. As the wave moves along the line the capaci-
tance of the line is charged up and the moving charges
cause magnetic energy to be stored. Thus the propaga-
tion of such an electromagneticwave constitutes a ﬂow
of energy.
After sufﬁcient time the magnitude of the wave may
be measured at any point along the line. The line does
not therefore appear to the generator as an open cir-
cuit but presents a deﬁnite load Z0. If the sending-end
voltage is VS and the sending-end current is IS then
Z0 =VS/IS. Thus all of the energy is absorbed by
the line and the line behaves in a similar manner to
the generator as would a single ‘lumped’ impedance
of value Z0 connected directly across the generator
terminals.
There are four parameters associated with transmis-
sion lines, these being resistance, inductance, capaci-
tance and conductance.
(i)
Resistance R is given by R =ρl/A, where ρ is
the resistivity of the conductor material, A is the
cross-sectional area of each conductor and l is the
length of the conductor (for a two-wire system, l
represents twice the length of the line).Resistance
is stated in ohms per metre length of a line and
represents the imperfection of the conductor. A
resistance stated in ohms per loop metre is a little
more speciﬁc since it takes into consideration the
fact that there are two conductors in a particular
length of line.
(ii)
Inductance L is due to the magnetic ﬁeld sur-
rounding the conductors of a transmission line
when a current ﬂows through them. The induc-
tance of an isolated twin line is considered in
Section 43.7. From equation (23), page 660, the
inductance L is given by
L = μ0μr
π
1
4 + lnD
a
 
henry/metre
where D is the distance between centres of the
conductor and a is the radius of each conductor. In
most practical lines μr =1. An inductance stated
in henrys per loop metre takes into consideration
the fact that there are two conductors in a partic-
ular length of line.
(iii)
Capacitance C exists as a result of the electric
ﬁeld between conductors of a transmission line.
The capacitance of an isolated twin line is con-
sidered in Section 43.3. From equation (14), page
652, the capacitance between the two conductors
is given by
C = πε0εr
ln(D/a) farads/metre
In most practical lines εr =1
(iv)
Conductance G is due to the insulation of the
line allowing some current to leak from one con-
ductor to the other. Conductance is measured in
siemens per metre length of line and represents
the imperfection of the insulation. Another name
for conductance is leakance.
Each of the four transmission line constants, R, L, C
and G, known as the primary constants, are uniformly
distributed along the line.
From Chapter 44, when a symmetrical T-network is ter-
minated in its characteristic impedance Z0, the input
impedance of the network is also equal to Z0. Similarly,
if a number of identical T-sections are connected in cas-
cade, the input impedance of the network will also be
equal to Z0

Figure 47.1
A transmission line can be considered to consist of a
network of a very large number of cascaded T-sections
each a very short length (δl) of transmission line, as
shown in Figure 47.1. This is an approximation of the
uniformly distributed line; the larger the number of
lumped parameter sections, the nearer it approaches the
true distributed nature of the line. When the genera-
tor VS is connected, a current IS ﬂows which divides
between that ﬂowing through the leakage conductance
G, which is lost, and that which progressively charges
each capacitor C and which sets up the voltage travelling
wave moving along the transmission line. The loss or
attenuation in the line is caused by both the conductance
G and the series resistance R

Each section of that shown in Figure 47.1 is simply
a low-pass ﬁlter possessing losses R and G. If losses
are neglected, and R and G are removed, the circuit
simpliﬁes and the inﬁnite line reduces to a repetitive
T-section
low-pass
ﬁlter
network,
as
shown
in
Figure 47.2. Let a generator be connected to the line as
shown and let the voltage be rising to a maximum posi-
tive value just at the instant when the line is connectedto
it. A current IS ﬂows through inductance L1 into capac-
itor C1. The capacitor charges and a voltage develops
across it. The voltage sends a current through inductance
L′
1 and L2 into capacitor C2. The capacitor charges and
the voltage developed across it sends a current through
L′
2 and L3 into C3, and so on. Thus all capacitors will
in turn charge up to the maximum input voltage. When
the generator voltage falls, each capacitor is charged in
turn in opposite polarity, and as before the input charge
is progressively passed along to the next capacitor. In
this manner voltage and current waves travel along the
line together and depend on each other.
The process outlined above takes time; for exam-
ple, by the time capacitor C3 has reached its maximum
voltage, the generator input may be at zero or moving
towards its minimum value. There will therefore be a
time, and thus a phase difference between the generator
input voltage and the voltage at any point on the line.
Phase delay
Since the line shown in Figure 47.2 is a ladder network
of low-pass T-section ﬁlters, it is shown in equation (27),
page 717, that the phase delay, β, is given by:
β = ω√(LC) radians/metre
(1)
where L and C are the inductance and capacitance per
metre of the line.
Wavelength
The wavelength λ on a line is the distance between a
given point and the next point along the line at which
the voltage is the same phase, the initial point leading

the latter point by 2π radian. Since in one wavelength a
phase change of 2π radians occurs, the phase change per
metreis2π/λ.Hence,phasechangepermetre,β=2π/λ
or

Velocity of propagation
The velocity of propagation, u, is given by u=f λ,
where f is the frequency and λ the wavelength. Hence
u = fλ= f(2π/β) = 2πf
β

β
(3)
The velocity of propagation of free space is the same
as that of light, i.e. approximately 300×106m/s. The
velocity of electrical energy along a line is always less
than the velocity in free space. The wavelength λ of
radiation in free space is given by λ=c/f where c is
the velocity of light. Since the velocity along a line is
always less than c, the wavelength correspondingto any
particular frequency is always shorter on the line than it
would be in free space.

47.4 Current and voltage
relationships
Figure 47.3 shows a voltage source VS applied to the
input terminals of an inﬁnite line, or a line terminated in
its characteristic impedance,such that a current IS ﬂows
into the line. At a point, say, 1km down the line, let
the current be I1. The current I1 will not have the same
magnitude as IS because of line attenuation; also I1 will
lag IS by some angle β. The ratio IS/I1 is therefore a
phasor quantity. Let the current a further 1km down the
line be I2, and so on, as shown in Figure 47.3. Each unit
length of line can be treated as a section of a repetitive
network, as explained in Section 47.2. The attenuation
is in the form of a logarithmic decay and

where γ is the propagation constant, ﬁrst introduced
in Section 45.7, page 714. γ has no unit.
Figure 47.3
The propagationconstant is a complex quantity given
by γ =α +jβ, where α is the attenuation constant,
whose unit is the neper, and β is the phase shift coefﬁ-
cient, whose unit is the radian. For n such 1km sections,
IS/IR =enγ where IR is the current at the receiving end.
Hence IS
IR
=en(α +jβ) =e(nα +jnβ) =enα∠nβ
from which, IR = ISe−nγ = ISe−nα∠∠∠−nβ
(4)
In equation (4), the attenuation on the line is given by
nα nepers and the phase shift is nβ radians.
At all points along an inﬁnite line, the ratio of voltage
to current is Z0, the characteristic impedance.Thus from
equation (4) it follows that:
receiving end voltage,
VR = VSe−nγ = VSe−nα∠∠∠−nβ
(5)
Z0, γ , α, and β are referred to as the secondary line
constants or coefﬁcients.
Problem 3.
When operating at a frequency of
2kHz, a cable has an attenuation of 0.25Np/km and
a phase shift of 0.20rad/km. If a 5V r.m.s. signal is
applied at the sending end, determine the voltage at
a point 10km down the line, assuming that the
termination is equal to the characteristic impedance
of the line.
Let VR be the voltage at a point n km from the sending
end, then from equation (5),
VR =VSe−nγ = VSe−nα∠−nβ
Since α =0.25Np/km, β =0.20rad/km, VS =5V and
n=10km, then
VR = (5)e−(10)(0.25)∠−(10)(0.20) = 5e−2.5∠−2.0V

A transmission line 5km long has a
characteristic impedance of 800∠−25◦. At a
particular frequency, the attenuation coefﬁcient of
the line is 0.5Np/km and the phase shift coefﬁcient

of the current at the receiving end, if the sending
end voltage is 2.0∠0◦V r.m.s.
The receiving end voltage (from equation (5)) is
given by:
VR = VSe−nγ = VSe−nα∠−nβ
= (2.0∠0◦)e−(5)(0.5)∠−(5)(0.25)

its characteristic impedance are 8.0V and 2.0V
r.m.s., respectively. Determine the output voltage if
the length of the line is doubled.
The receiving-end voltage VR is given by VR =VSe−nγ .
Hence 2.0=8.0e−nγ , from which,
e−nγ =2.0/8.0= 0.25
If the line is doubled in length, then
VR = 8.0e−2nγ = 8.0(e−nγ )2

Characteristic impedance and
propagation coefﬁcient in terms
of the primary constants
Characteristic impedance
At all points along an inﬁnite line, the ratio of voltage to
current is called the characteristic impedance Z0. The
value of Z0 is independent of the length of the line; it
merely describes a property of a line that is a function of
the physical construction of the line. Since a short length
of line may be considered as a ladder of identical low-
pass ﬁlter sections, the characteristic impedance may be
determined from equation (2), page 667, i.e.
Z0 = √(ZOCZSC)
(6)
since the open-circuit impedance ZOC and the short-
circuit impedance ZSC may be easily measured.
Problem 6.
At a frequency of 1.5kHz the
open-circuit impedance of a length of transmission
line is 800∠−50◦ and the short-circuit impedance
is 413∠−20◦. Determine the characteristic
impedance of the line at this frequency.
From equation (6), characteristic impedance
Z0 = √(ZOCZSC)
= √[(800∠−50◦)(413∠−20◦)]
= √(330400∠−70◦) = 575∠∠∠−35◦
by de Moivre’s theorem.
The characteristic impedanceof a transmission line may
also be expressed in terms of the primary constants, R,
L, G and C. Measurements of the primary constants
may be obtained for a particular line and manufacturers
usually state them for a standard length.
Let a very short length of line δl metres be as shown
in Figure 47.4, comprising a single T-section. Each
series arm impedance is Z1 =1
2(R +jwL)δl ohms, and
the shunt arm impedance is

47.6 Distortion on transmission lines
If the waveform at the receiving end of a transmis-
sion line is not the same shape as the waveform at the
sending end, distortion is said to have occurred. The
three main causes of distortion on transmission lines
are as follows.
(i)
The characteristic impedance Z0 of a line
varies with the operating frequency, i.e. from
equation (7),
Z0 =

R + jωL
G + jωC ohms
The terminating impedance of the line may not
vary with frequency in the same manner.
In the above equation for Z0, if the frequency
is very low, ω is low and Z0≈√(R/G). If the
frequency is very high, then ωL≫R, ωC ≫G
and Z0 ≈√(L/C). A graph showing the variation
of Z0 with frequency f is shown in Figure 47.7.
Figure 47.7
If the characteristic impedance is to be con-
stant throughout the entire operating frequency
range then the following condition is required:

Part 4
756
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
√(L/C)=√(R/G), i.e L/C =R/G, from which
LG = CR
(12)
Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR it is
possible to provide a termination equal to the
characteristic impedance Z0 at all frequencies.
(ii)
The attenuation of a line varies with the operating
frequency (since γ = √[(R +jωL)(G+jωC)],
from equation (10)), thus waves of differing fre-
quencies and component frequencies of complex
waves are attenuated by different amounts.
From the above equation for the propagation
coefﬁcient:
γ 2 = (R + jωL)(G + jωC)
= RG + jω(LG + CR) −ω2LC
If LG=CR=x, then LG+CR=2x and LG+CR
may be written as 2√x2, i.e. LG+CR may be
written as 2√[(LG)(CR)]
Thus γ 2 = RG+jω(2

[(LG)(CR)])−ω2LC
= [

(RG) + jω

(LC)]2
and
γ =

(RG) + jω

(LC)
Since γ = α + jβ,
attenuation coefﬁcient, α =

(RG)
(13)
and phase-shift coefﬁcient, β = ω

(LC)
(14)
Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR,
α =√(RG), i.e. the attenuation coefﬁcient is
independent of frequency and all frequencies are
equally attenuated.
(iii)
The delay time, or the time of propagation, and
thus the velocity of propagation, varies with
frequency and therefore waves of different fre-
quencies arrive at the termination with differing
delays. From equation (14), the phase-shift
coefﬁcient, β =ω√(LC) when LG=CR
Velocity of propagation, u = ω
β =
ω
ω√(LC)
i.e.
u=
1
√(LC)
(15)
Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR, the
velocity of propagation, and hence the time
delay, is independent of frequency.
From the above it appears that the condition LG=CR
is appropriate for the design of a transmission line,
since under this condition no distortion is introduced.
This means that the signal at the receiving end is the
same as the sending-end signal except that it is reduced
in amplitude and delayed by a ﬁxed time. Also, with
no distortion, the attenuation on the line is a minimum.
In practice, however, R/L≫G/C. The inductance
is usually low and the capacitance is large and not
easily reduced. Thus if the condition LG=CR is to be
achieved in practice, either L or G must be increased
since neither CN or R can really be altered. It is unde-
sirable to increase G since the attenuation and power
losses increase. Thus the inductance L is the quantity
that needs to be increased and such an artiﬁcial increase
in the line inductance is called loading. This is achieved
either by inserting inductancecoils at intervals along the
transmission line – this being called‘lumped loading’ –
or by wrapping the conductors with a high-permeability
metal tape – this being called ‘continuous loading’.
Problem 11.
An underground cable has the
following primary constants: resistance
R =10/loop km, inductance L=1.5mH/loopkm,
conductance G= 1.2μS/km and capacitance
C =0.06μF/km. Determine by how much the
inductance should be increased to satisfy the
condition for minimum distortion.
From equation (12), the condition for minimum distor-
tion is given by LG=CR, from which,
inductance L = CR
G = (0.06×10−6)(10)
1.2 × 10−6
= 0.5 H or 500mH.

47.7 Wave reﬂection and
the reﬂection coefﬁcient
In earlier sections of this chapter it was assumed that
the transmission line had been properlyterminated in its
characteristic impedance or regarded as an inﬁnite line.
In practice, of course, all lines have a deﬁnite length and
often the terminating impedance does not have the same
value as the characteristic impedance of the line. When
this is the case, the transmission line is said to have a
‘mismatched load’.
The forward-travelling wave moving from the source
to the load is called the incident wave or the sending-
end wave. With a mismatched load the termination will
absorb only a part of the energy of the incident wave,
the remainder being forced to return back along the
line toward the source. This latter wave is called the
reﬂected wave.
Electrical energy is transmitted by a transmission
line; when such energy arrives at a termination that has
a value different from the characteristic impedance, it
experiences a sudden change in the impedance of the
medium. When this occurs, some reﬂection of incident
energy occurs and the reﬂected energy is lost to the
receiving load. (Reﬂections commonly occur in nature
when a change of transmission medium occurs; for
example, sound waves are reﬂected at a wall, which can
produce echoes, and light rays are reﬂected by mirrors.)
If a transmission line is terminated in its character-
istic impedance, no reﬂection occurs; if terminated in
an open circuit or a short circuit, total reﬂection occurs,
i.e. the whole of the incident wave reﬂects along the
line. Between these extreme possibilities, all degrees of
reﬂection are possible.
Open-circuited termination
If a length of transmission line is open-circuited at the
termination, no current can ﬂow in it and thus no power
can be absorbed by the termination. This condition is
achieved if a current is imagined to be reﬂected from
the termination, the reﬂected current having the same
magnitude as the incident wave but with a phase differ-
ence of 180◦. Also, since no power is absorbed at the
termination (it is all returned back along the line), the
reﬂected voltage wave at the termination must be equal
to the incident wave. Thus the voltage at the termina-
tion must be doubled by the open circuit. The resultant
current (and voltage) at any point on the transmission
line and at any instant of time is given by the sum of the
currents (and voltages) due to the incident and reﬂected
waves (see Section 47.8).

Part 4
758
Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Short-circuit termination
If the termination of a transmission line is short-
circuited, the impedance is zero, and hence the voltage
developed across it must be zero. As with the open-
circuit condition, no power is absorbed by the termi-
nation. To obtain zero voltage at the termination, the
reﬂected voltage wave must be equal in amplitude but
opposite in phase (i.e. 180◦phase difference)to the inci-
dent wave. Since no power is absorbed, the reﬂected
current wave at the termination must be equal to the
incident current wave and thus the current at the end of
the line must be doubled at the short circuit. As with the
open-circuited case, the resultant voltage (and current)
at any point on the line and at any instant of time is
given by the sum of the voltages (and currents) due to
the incident and reﬂected waves.
Energy associated with a travelling wave
A travelling wave on a transmission line may be
thought of as being made up of electric and magnetic
components. Energy is stored in the magnetic ﬁeld
due to the current (energy= 1
2LI2 – see page 663) and
energy is stored in the electric ﬁeld due to the volt-
age (energy= 1
2CV2 – see page 654). It is the continual
interchange of energy between the magnetic and elec-
tric ﬁelds, and vice versa,that causes the transmission of
the total electromagnetic energy along the transmission
line.
When a wave reaches an open-circuited termination
the magnetic ﬁeld collapses since the current I is zero.
Energy cannot be lost, but it can change form. In this
case it is converted into electrical energy, adding to that
already caused by the existing electric ﬁeld. The volt-
age at the termination consequently doubles and this
increased voltage starts the movement of a reﬂected
wave back along the line. A magnetic ﬁeld will be set up
by this movement and the total energy of the reﬂected
wave will again be shared between the magnetic and
electric ﬁeld components.
When a wave meets a short-circuited termination, the
electric ﬁeld collapses and its energy changes form to
the magnetic energy. This results in a doubling of the
current.

terminated in an impedance ZR, where Z0 ̸= ZR, as
shown in Figure 47.8. The sending-end or incident cur-
rent Ii ﬂowing from the source generator ﬂows along the
line and, until it arrives at the termination ZR, behaves
as though the line were inﬁnitely long or properly
terminated in its characteristic impedance, Z0

The incident voltage Vi shown in Figure 47.8 is given
by:
Vi = IiZ0
(12)
from which
Ii = Vi
Z0

At the termination, the conditions must be such that:
ZR = total voltage
total current
SinceZR ̸=Z0,partoftheincidentwavewillbereﬂected

reﬂected voltage be Vr and the reﬂected current be Ir
Then
Vr = −IrZ0
(14)
from which
Ir = −Vr
Z0
(15)
(Note the minus sign, since the reﬂected voltage and
current waveforms travel in the opposite direction to
the incident waveforms.)
Thus, at the termination,
ZR = total voltage
total current = Vi + Vr
Ii + Ir
= IiZ0 −IrZ0
Ii + Ir
from equations (12)
and (14)
i.e.
ZR = Z0(Ii −Ir)
(Ii + Ir)
Hence
ZR(Ii + Ir) = Z0(Ii −Ir)
ZRIi + ZRIr = Z0Ii −Z0Ir
Z0Ir + ZRIr = Z0Ii −ZRIi
Ir(Z0 + ZR) = Ii(Z0 −ZR)
from which Ir

The ratio of the reﬂected current to the incident current
is called the reﬂection coefﬁcient and is often given the
symbol ρ, i.e.

By similar reasoningto abovean expressionfor the ratio
of the reﬂected to the incident voltage may be obtained.
From above,
ZR = Vi + Vr
Ii + Ir
=
Vi + Vr
(Vi/Z0) −(Vr/Z0)
from equations (13) and (15),
i.e.
ZR =
Vi + Vr
(Vi −Vr)/Z0
Hence
ZR

(Vi −Vr) = Vi + Vr

Thus the ratio of the reﬂected to the incident voltage has
the same magnitude as the ratio of reﬂected to incident
current, but is of opposite sign. From equations (16) and
(17) it is seen that when ZR =Z0, ρ =0 and there is no
reﬂection.

Section 47.7, the reﬂected current is of the same mag-
nitude as the incident current but is 180◦out of phase.

Figure 47.10 Current waveforms on an open-circuited trans-
mission line
The resultant of the two waves is obtained by adding
them at intervals. In this case the resultant is seen
to be zero. Figures 47.10(b) and (c) show the inci-
dent and reﬂected waves drawn separately as times
t =T/8 seconds and t =T/4, where T is the periodic
time of the signal. Again, the resultant is obtained by
adding the incident and reﬂected waveforms at inter-
vals. Figures 47.10(d) to (h) show the incident and
reﬂected current waveforms plotted on the same axis,
together with their resultant waveform,at times t =3T/8
to t =7T/8 at intervals of T/8
If the resultant waveforms shown in Figures 47.10(a)
to (g) are superimposed one uponthe other, Figure 47.11
results. (Note that the scale has been increased for clar-
ity.) The waveforms show clearly that waveform (a)
moves to (b) after T/8, then to (c) after a further period
of T/8, then to (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) at intervals of T/8.
It is noted that at any particular point the current varies
sinusoidally with time, but the amplitude of oscillation
is different at different points on the line.
Whenever two waves of the same frequency and
amplitude travelling in opposite directions are super-
imposed on each other as above, interference takes
place between the two waves and a standing or sta-
tionary wave is produced. The points at which the
current is always zero are called nodes (labelled N in
Figure 47.11). The standing wave does not progress to
the left or right and the nodes do not oscillate. Those
points on the wave that undergo maximum disturbance
are called antinodes (labelled A in Figure 47.11). The
distance between adjacent nodes or adjacent antinodes
is λ/2, where λ is the wavelength. A standing wave is
therefore seen to be a periodic variation in the verti-
cal plane taking place on the transmission line without
travel in either direction.
The resultant of the incident and reﬂected volt-
age for the open-circuit termination may be deduced
in a similar manner to that for current. However, as
stated in Section 47.7, when the incident voltage wave
reaches the termination it is reﬂected without phase
change. Figure 47.12 shows the resultant waveforms of
incident and reﬂected voltages at intervals of t =T/8.
Figure 47.13 shows all the resultant waveforms of
Figure 47.12(a) to (h) superimposed; again, standing
waves are seen to result. Nodes (labelled N) and antin-
odes (labelled A) are shown in Figure 47.13 and, in
comparison with the current waves, are seen to occur
90◦out of phase.
If the transmission line is short-circuited at the
termination, it is the incident current that is reﬂected
without phase change and the incident voltage that is

mination and the diagrams shown in Figures 47.12 and
47.13 representing voltage at an open-circuited termi-
nation may be used to represent current conditions at a
short-circuited termination.
Figure 47.14 shows the r.m.s. current and voltage
waveforms plotted on the same axis against distance for
the case of total reﬂection, deduced from Figures 47.11
and 47.13. The r.m.s. values are equal to the amplitudes
of the waveforms shown in Figures 47.11 and 47.13,
except that they are each divided by √2 (since, for
a sine wave, r.m.s. value=(1/√2)×maximum value).
Withtotalreﬂection,thestanding-wavepatternsofr.m.s.
voltage and current consist of a succession of positive
sine waves with the voltage node located at the cur-
rent antinode and the current node located at the voltage
antinode. The termination is a current nodal point. The
r.m.s. values of current and voltage may be recorded on
a suitable r.m.s. instrument moving along the line. Such
measurements of the maximum and minimum voltage
and current can provide a reasonably accurate indica-
tion of the wavelength, and also provide information
regarding the amount of reﬂected energy relative to the
incident energy that is absorbed at the termination, as
shown below.
Standing-wave ratio
Let the incident current ﬂowing from the source of a
mismatched low-loss transmission line be Ii and the
current reﬂected at the termination be Ir. If IMAX is the
sum of the incident and reﬂected current, and IMIN is
their difference, then the standing-wave ratio (symbol
s) on the line is deﬁned as:
s = IMAX
IMIN
= Ii + Ir
Ii −Ir
(19)
Hence s(Ii −Ir) = Ii + Ir
sIi −sIr = Ii + Ir
sIi −Ii = sIr + Ir
Ii(s −1) = Ir(s + 1)

Thus the ratio of the reﬂected to the transmitted power
may be calculated directly from the standing-wave ratio,
which may be calculated from measurements of IMAX
and IMIN. When a transmission line is properly ter-
minated there is no reﬂection, i.e. Ir =0, and from
equation (19) the standing-wave ratio is 1. From equa-
tion (21), when s =1, Pr =0, i.e. there is no reﬂected
power. In practice, the standing-wave ratio is kept as
close to unity as possible. From equation(16), thereﬂec-
tion coefﬁcient, ρ =Ir/Ii. Thus, from equation (20),
|ρ|= s −1
s +1
Rearranging gives: |ρ|(s + 1) = (s −1)
|ρ|s + |ρ| = s −1
1 + |ρ| = s(1 −|ρ|)

s = 1 + |ρ|

Equation (22) gives an expression for the standing-
wave ratio in terms of the magnitude of the reﬂection
coefﬁcient.

A transmission line has a
characteristic impedance of 600∠0◦ and
negligible loss. If the terminating impedance of the
line is (400+j250), determine (a) the reﬂection
coefﬁcient and (b) the standing-wave ratio.
(a) From equation (16),
reﬂection coefﬁcient, ρ = Z0 −ZR
Z0 + ZR

600∠0◦+ (400 + j250)

1030.78∠14.04◦
Hence ρ =0.3106∠∠∠−65.38◦
(b) From above,|ρ|=0.3106. Thus from equation (22),

1 −|ρ| = 1 + 0.3106

(c) the incident current ﬂowing if the reﬂected

Transients and Laplace
transforms
Why it is important to understand: Transients and Laplace transforms
A transient state will exist in a circuit containing one or more energy storage elements (i.e. capacitors
and inductors) whenever the energy conditions in the circuit change, until the new steady state condition
is reached. Transients are caused by changing the applied voltage or current, or by changing any of the
circuit elements; such changes occur due to opening and closing switches. In this chapter, such equations
are developed analytically by using both differential equations and Laplace transforms for different
waveform supply voltages. The solution of most electrical problems can be reduced ultimately to the
solution of differential equations and the use of Laplace transforms provides an alternative method to
those used previously. Laplace transforms provide a convenient method for the calculationof the complete
response of a circuit. In this chapter, the technique of Laplace transforms is developed and then used
to solve differential equations; in addition, Laplace transforms are used to analyse transient responses
directly from circuit diagrams
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
•
determine the transient response of currents and voltages in R–L, R–C and L–R–C series circuits using
differential equations
•
deﬁne the Laplace transform of a function
•
use a table of Laplace transforms of functions commonly met in electrical engineering for transient analysis
of simple networks
•
use partial fractions to deduce inverse Laplace transforms
•
deduce expressions for component and circuit impedances in the s-plane given initial conditions
•
use Laplace transform analysis directly from circuit diagrams in the s-plane
•
deduce Kirchhoff’s law equations in the s-plane for determining the response of R–L, R–C and L–R–C
networks, given initial conditions
•
explain the conditions for which an L–R–C circuit response is over, critical, under or zero-damped and
calculate circuit responses
•
predict the circuit response of an L–R–C network, given non-zero initial conditions

48.1 Introduction
A transient state will exist in a circuit containing one
or more energy storage elements (i.e. capacitors and
inductors) whenever the energy conditions in the cir-
cuit change, until the new steady state condition is
reached. Transients are caused by changing the applied
voltage or current, or by changing any of the circuit
elements; such changes occur due to opening and clos-
ing switches. Transients were introduced in Chapter 19
where growth and decay curves were constructed and
their equations stated for step inputs only. In this chap-
ter, such equations are developed analytically by using
both differential equations and Laplace transforms
for different waveform supply voltages.
48.2 Response of R–C series circuit

Charging a capacitor
A series R–C circuit is shown in Figure 48.1(a).
A step voltage of magnitude V
is shown in
Figure 48.1(b). The capacitor in Figure 48.1(a) is
assumed to be initially uncharged.
From Kirchhoff’s voltage law, supply voltage,
V = vC + vR
(1)
Voltage vR =iR and current i =C dvc
dt , hence
vR =CRdvC
dt
Therefore, from equation (1)
V = vC + CRdvC
dt

This is a linear, constant coefﬁcient, ﬁrst-order dif-
ferential equation. Such a differential equation may
be solved, i.e. ﬁnd an expression for voltage vC, by

When time t =0, vC =0, hence −ln V =k

Discharging a capacitor
If after a period of time the step input voltage V applied

At time t =0 (i.e. at the instant of opening the switch),
vC =V

(a)
When the supply is cut off, the circuit consists of
just the 10 resistor and the 2H coil in parallel.
This is effectively the same circuit as Figure 48.6
with the supply voltage zero.
From equation (17), current i = V
R e−Rt/L
In this case V
R = 5A, the initial value of current.
When i =200mA or 0.2A
0.2 = 5e−10t/2
i.e.
0.2
5 = e−5t
thus ln0.2
5 = −5t
and time, t = −1
5 ln0.2
5 = 0.644 s or 644 ms
(b)
Since the current through the coil can only return
through the 10 resistance, the voltage across
the resistor is a maximum at the moment of
disconnection, i.e.
vRm = IR = (5)(10) = 50V

used to stop the heart, in the hope that the heart will
restart with rhythmic contractions).

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
Hence from equation (20):
V = LC d2vC
dt2 + RC dvC
dt + vC
(21)
This is a linear, constant coefﬁcient, second-order dif-
ferential equation. (For the solution of second-order
differential equations, see Higher Engineering Math-
ematics.)
To determine the transient response, the supply p.d.,
V , is made equal to zero,
i.e.
LC d2vC
dt2 + RC dvC
dt + vC = 0
(22)
A solution can be found by letting vC =Aemt, from
which,
dvC
dt = Amemt and dvC
dt2 = Am2emt
Substituting these expressions into equation (22) gives:
LC(Am2emt) + RC(Amemt) + Aemt = 0
i.e.
Aemt(m2LC + mRC + 1) = 0
Thus vC =Aemt is a solution of the given equation
provided that
m2LC + mRC + 1 = 0
(23)
This is called the auxiliary equation.
Using the quadratic formula on equation (23) gives:
m = −RC ± √[(RC)2 −4(LC)(1)]

This equation may have either:
(i)
two different real roots, when (R/2L)2 >
(1/LC),whenthecircuitissaidtobe overdamped
since the transient voltage decays very slowly
with time, or
(ii)
two real equal roots, when (R/2L)2 =(1/LC),
when the circuit is said to be critically damped
since the transient voltagedecays in the minimum
amount of time without oscillations occurring, or
(iii)
two complex roots, when (R/2L)2 <(1/LC),
when the circuit is said to be underdamped
since the transient voltage oscillates about the
ﬁnal steady state value, the oscillations eventually
dying away to give the steady state value, or
(iv)
if R=0 in equation (24), the oscillations would
continue indeﬁnitely without any reduction in
amplitude – this is the undamped condition.
Damping is discussed again in Section 48.8 with typical
current responses sketched in Figure 48.30 on page 795.

To determine the actual expression for the voltage

Assumingin,say,case(iii)thatattimet =0,vC =v0 and

48.5 Introduction to Laplace*
transforms
The solution of most electrical problems can be reduced
ultimately to the solution of differential equations, and
the use of Laplace transforms provides an alternative
method to those used previously. Laplace transforms
provide a convenient method for the calculation of the
complete response of a circuit. In this section and in
Section 48.5 the technique of Laplace transforms is
developed and then used to solve differential equations.
In Section 48.7 Laplace transforms are used to analyse
transient responses directly from circuit diagrams.
Deﬁnition of a Laplace transform
The Laplace transform of the function of time f(t) is
deﬁned by the integral
" ∞
0
e−stf(t)dt
where s is a parameter
There are various commonly used notations for the
Laplace transform of f(t) and these include
 {f(t)}
or L{f(t)} or
 (f ) or Lf or f (s).
Also the letter p is sometimes used instead of s as
the parameter. The notation used in this chapter will
be f(t) for the original function and
 {f(t)} for its
Laplace transform,
i.e.
 {f(t)} =

for large values of time t, i.e. after all transient effects

Use of partial fractions for inverse Laplace
transforms
Sometimes the function whose inverse is required is not
recognizable as a standard type, such as those listed in
Table 48.1. In such cases it may be possible, by using
partial fractions, to resolve the function into simpler
fractions which may be inverted on sight.
For example, the function F(s)= 2s −3
s(s −3) cannot be
inverted on sight from Table 48.1. However, using
partial fractions:
2s −3
s(s −3) ≡A
s +
B
s −3 = A(s −3) + Bs
s(s −3)
from which, 2s −3=A(s −3) + Bs
Letting s =0 gives: −3=−3A from which A=1
Letting s =3 gives: 3=3B from which B =1
Hence 2s −3
s(s −3) ≡1
s +

s −3

48.7 Laplace transform analysis
directly from the circuit diagram
Resistor
At any instant in time v =Ri
Since v and i are both functions of time, a more correct
equation would be v(t)=Ri(t)
However, this is normally assumed. The Laplace
transform of this equation is:
V(s) = RI(s)
Hence, in the s-domain R(s)= V(s)
I(s) =R
(Note that V(s) merely means that it is the Laplace
transform of v and I(s) is the Laplace transform of i.

Whenever the Laplace transform of functions is taken
it is referred to as the ‘s-domain’ – as opposed to the
‘time domain’.)
The resistor is shown in Figure 48.14 in both the time
domain and the s-domain.

Inductor
If an inductor has no initial current, i.e. i =0 at time
t =0, the normal equation is v =L(di/dt) where L is
the inductance.
The Laplace transform of the equation is:
V (s)=L[sI(s) −i(0)] from equation (33)
and as i(0)=0 then V (s)=sLI(s)
Thus the impedance of the inductor in the s-domain is
given by:
Z(s) = V (s)
I(s) = sL
The inductor is shown in Figure 48.15 in both the time
domain and the s-domain.

Capacitor
If a capacitor has no initial voltage, i.e. v =0 at time
t =0, the normal equation is i =C(dv/dt).
The Laplace transform of the equation is:
I(s) = C[sV(s) −v(0)]
= sCV(s) since v(0) = 0
Thus the impedance of the capacitor in the s-domain is
given by:
Z(s) = V (s)
I(s) = V (s)
sCV(s) = 1
sC
The capacitor is shown in Figure 48.16 in both the time
domain and the s-domain.

Summarizing, in the time domain, the circuit elements
are R, L and C and in the s-domain, the circuit elements
are R, sL and (1/sC).
Note that the impedance of L is XL =jωL and the
impedance of C is Xc =(−j/ωC)=(1/jωC).
Thus, just replacing jω with s gives the s-domain
expressions for L and C. (Because of this apparent
association with j, s is sometimes called the com-
plex frequency and the s-domain called the complex
frequency domain.)

Kirchhoff’s laws in the s-domain
Kirchhoff’s∗current and voltage laws may be applied
to currents and voltages in the s-domain just as they
can with normal time domain currents and voltages. To
∗Who was Kirchhoff? For image and resume of Kirchhoff, see

solve circuits in the s-domain using Kirchhoff’s laws
the procedure is:
(i)
change the time domain circuit to an s-domain
circuit,
(ii)
apply Kirchhoff’s laws in terms of s,
(iii)
solve the equation to obtain the Laplace trans-
form of the unknown quantity and
(iv)
determine the inverse Laplace transform after
rearranging into a form that can be recognized
in a table of standard transforms.
This procedure is demonstrated in the following
problems.
Problem 30.
Determine an expression for (a) the
current i through and (b) the voltage vc across the

uncharged.

48.9 Initial conditions
In an L–R–C circuit it is possible, at time t =0, for an
inductor to carry a current or a capacitor to possess a
charge.
(a) For an inductor: vL =Ldi
dt
The Laplace transform of this equation is:
vL(s)=L[sI(s)−i(0)]
If, say, i(0) = I0 then vL(s) = sLI(s) −LI0
(43)
The p.d. across the inductor in the s-domain is given by:
(sL)I(s)
Equation (43) would appear to comprise two series
elements, i.e.
vL(s)=(p.d. across L)+(voltage generator of−LI 0)
An inductor can thus be considered as an impedance sL
in series with an independent voltage source of −LI0 as
shown in Figure 48.31.

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology
If V = 0 in equation (44) then 0 = iR + L di

i.e. 0 = I(s)R + L[sI(s) −I0]
= I(s)R + sLI(s) −LI0 which veriﬁes

In this case I0 =(V/R), the steady state current before

R = I(s)(R + sL)

(b) For a capacitor: i =C dv

The Laplace transform of this equation is:
I(s) = C[sV (s) −v(0)]
If, say, v(0) = V0
then
I(s) = CsV (s) −CV0
