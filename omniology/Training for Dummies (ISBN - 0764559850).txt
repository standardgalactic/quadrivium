Foreword
I
n the past ten years, the role of many trainers has slowly evolved from that
of training “order taker” to a real participant in the strategic decisions made
by senior management. Even with this exciting new role as a strategic partner,
a vast group of talented trainers and other workplace learning and perfor-
mance professionals spend their days designing, delivering, and evaluating
training programs that will have a positive impact on job and organizational
performance. 
This group of dedicated and enthusiastic professionals often admit to falling
into the profession from a wide variety of backgrounds. Teachers, human
resource managers, subject matter experts (SMEs), managers, and supervisors
have all become “accidental trainers.” For some, this accident has turned
into a lifelong passion for facilitating learning. For others, training is only a
temporary, albeit critically important, assignment.
However, make no mistake. Both the accidental trainer and today’s highly
motivated workplace learning and performance professional share a common
goal as a developer of human potential. They are powerful instruments to
drive organizational performance that is ultimately hardwired directly to
every company’s bottom line.
When this book project started, author Elaine Biech — who has special ties
to ASTD as a long-standing, active member and contributor — was busily
involved as the author and developer of ASTD’s highly demanded Training
Certificate Program. We are proud to have our organization associated with
this book and with Elaine. I encourage you to apply what you learn in this
book, as well as to engage the resources our organization provides to the
training and development profession. Seize the opportunity to make a posi-
tive impact on individual and organizational performance, and ultimately
deliver ASTD’s mission of “Creating a World that Works Better.”

Introduction
T
raining is the best job I’ve ever had. That’s because the training profession
is one that touches almost everyone every day. Whether you’re taking a
golf lesson, finding out how to use new computer software, trying out a new
recipe, or being coached by your boss, you’re experiencing training. Your
trainer doesn’t need to be in the same room or on the same schedule.
What other job affords you the opportunity to increase an organization’s
bottom line, improve your country’s productivity level, and enhance individ-
uals’ lives, all at the same time? It is truly a privilege to be a trainer, yet it’s
also a responsibility. 
Training is a profession on the move, and those moves are ones to be proud of.
As I finished this book, the American Society for Training and Development
(ASTD), the trainers’ professional association, was putting the finishing touches
on the first internationally recognized Workplace Learning and Performance
certification process. Based on the competency study completed in 2004, cer-
tification will be the final and most critical element, providing credentials for
the profession and adding excitement to an already exciting profession.
Chapter 16 describes the certification process in more detail.
About This Book
Training For Dummies is both practical and fun. It has been written in a logical
sequence and is loaded with practical ideas. It is designed to take you through
a training cycle from start to finish, and in sequential order. So, if you want to,
you can start at the beginning of this book and move through to the end. If
you’re interested in finding only specific information, however, you can also
use the index at the back of the book or the Table of Contents near the front.
This book is also fun to read, but don’t let the conversational tone fool you. It
is jam-packed with technical knowledge about the training profession as well
as tips, tricks, and techniques for honing your training skills.
I feel fortunate that several gurus in the training profession have agreed to
contribute snippets of content that focus on their areas of expertise. So as
you read Training For Dummies, be sure to check out what experts like Thiagi
say about facilitation and Ann Herrmann-Nehdi say about learning styles.

Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I imagine you, the reader, sitting next to me and
telling me what you want to read about. And what did I hear you saying?
“Practical. Make it practical.” So I did. 
I assume you fall into one of two categories: Either you’re interested in becom-
ing a trainer, or you’re already a trainer and want to hone your skills. Perhaps
you’re even interested in obtaining professional certification from ASTD. 
I also assume that you’ve been a participant in training and that some of
those training sessions have been life-changing, while others have been a
waste of your time. And I assume that you want to know how to conduct
more of the former and none of the latter. 
I assume that you know how important the training profession is to corpora-
tions’ bottom lines as well as this country’s productivity. 
Finally, I make one other assumption: that is that you love (or will grow to
love) training as much as I do!
How This Book Is Organized
Training For Dummies is divided into six parts, and the chapters within each
part cover specific topics in detail. The parts and chapters follow a logical
sequence — from thinking about becoming a trainer to designing, delivering,
and evaluating a training session and, finally to ensuring that you continue to
enhance your professionalism.
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer!
This part explores the field of training and uncovers what a trainer does. It
introduces you to The Training Cycle and presents a quick list of training
jargon. You can even explore whether you think you’d like a profession in
training. And if you’re already a trainer, a self-assessment provides data
about your areas of strength and those that may need a bit of shoring up.
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training
in the World
Trainers must remember one very important rule: It’s all about the learner.
When you have this concept firmly planted in your mind, you’re on the right
path to designing a successful training session. This part helps you understand
2
Training For Dummies 

how to assess your learners’ needs, how to write learning objectives, and
how to design a training session that will knock their socks off! You also
explore using off-the-shelf training programs and preparing for success.
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a
Dynamic Training Session
Many trainers are born stage hounds. And while training is not always a
circus, seeing people’s eyes light up when you put knowledge in their hands,
and seeing how their lives change with new skills, is often reward enough. 
This part focuses on the implementation aspect of a trainer’s job. It describes
how to deliver success by ensuring that learning occurs. It also helps you
become a master of audiovisuals and provides suggestions for how to address
the many problems that occur in a classroom.
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 
Evaluation and other follow-up activities occur at the end of The Training
Cycle, but they are of critical importance because only with evaluation can
you be assured that the training is a success. The training session may be
over, but your work is not. This part shows you how and why.
Part V: The Professional Trainer
The training profession is rapidly changing, and as a trainer, you must, too, if
you want to stay in the game. This part addresses three key areas that
encourage you to be a lifelong learner: ideas for continually upgrading your
skills and knowledge; an explanation of the ASTD certification process; and a
perspective on other aspects of the field of training.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without The Part of Tens. This easy-to-read
part includes six concise chapters that are filled with tips, techniques, and tid-
bits that are sure to enhance your training sessions instantly. In this part, you
discover the best ways to start every training session, methods for increasing
participation, tips for saving time in the classroom, ways to form small groups,
ideas to add humor to your training, and icebreakers that you can implement
immediately.
Look in this part first to find tips that are worth the price of the book. (Read
the entire book to uncover a professional goldmine.)

Training For Dummies 

Part I
So You’re Going
to Be a Trainer!

In this part . . .
You explore some basic thoughts about training. Are
you right for the job? What skills do you need to
brush up? Why do adults learn? By what process does
training occur? This part answers your most basic 
questions.

Chapter 1
What’s a Trainer?
In This Chapter
 Introducing the training profession and a trainer’s job
 Assessing your skills and abilities as a training professional
 Determining the importance of training
 Exploring a trainer’s (a)typical day
S
o you want to be a trainer. Or perhaps you already are a trainer, and
you’ve picked up this book to enhance your skills. In either case, this
chapter helps you understand the training profession and what’s expected
of trainers. 
Training is one of the most exciting jobs anyone can have. Although a trainer’s
role has changed substantially over the past decade and is currently going
through another metamorphosis, many of the positive aspects always remain
with the job. First, as a trainer you impact the work of many people — not
only the learners with whom you work but also supervisors, senior manage-
ment, clients, vendors, and perhaps even your company’s board of directors.
As a trainer, you have access to many people and can develop a broader pic-
ture of your organization’s needs. Trainers are usually good communicators
with good information. People listen to you.
In addition, training is exciting because it is a job that is an integral step in an
organization’s efforts toward change and improvement. You may be a part of
defining the organization of today, envisioning the organization of the future,
and helping to incorporate the changes necessary to create the new organiza-
tion. As a trainer, you have the opportunity to influence the direction your
organization takes and how it gets there. 
Take a proactive stance in shaping your career. To be the most effective trainer,
find out all you can about the organization in which you work. What are the
primary issues it faces? Partner with those who lead your organization and
find out how you help them. Where are the pressure points that affect the
bottom line? Identify how your work can positively impact the bottom line,
given that you’re in a unique position to impact others. At the same time,
remember to also take the opportunity to impact your career.

In this chapter, you answer three big questions. 
 What is training and who uses it? 
 What do trainers do? 
 Do you have what it takes to be a trainer?
What Is Training?
You can say that a person has been in training since he was born. You have
been learning and changing into the knowledgeable, skilled adults you cur-
rently are. Everyone has received training, and we have also all trained
others. If you ever demonstrated the phone system to a new employee,
advised your boss regarding changes in your department, or explained a
shortcut for completing a task to a colleague, you were conducting training. 
Training is about change. It is about transformation. It is all about learning.
Training is a process designed to assist an individual to learn new skills,
knowledge, or attitudes. As a result, these individuals make a change or
transformation that improves or enhances their performance. These improve-
ments ensure that people and organizations are able to do things better,
faster, easier, and with higher quality and a better return on investment.
What forms does training take?
Learning is acquired in many training forums. You may have experienced
some of these. You may have a one-on-one session with your supervisor to
learn the benefits of a new product your company produces. You may attend
a class to upgrade your negotiating skills. You may take an online course to
learn how to use a new computer program. You may take a golf lesson to
learn how to improve your use of long irons. You may be coached by some-
one in your company to learn to be more politically savvy. The key word in
each of these examples is “learn.” The reason training is provided is so that
someone (or many people) learns something in order to make a change.
Trainers are necessary in every industry, from aardvark ranches to zipper
manufacturers. Trainers have jobs in private industry, education, not-for-
profit organizations, and government. 
Trainers work with people in all positions and at all levels in an organization:
executives, managers, supervisors, secretaries, production workers, scientists,
artists, doctors, lawyers, instructors, security guards, salespeople, teachers,
firefighters, authors, custodial workers, wait staff, and you. Even this book is
a form of training — self-directed training as you learn your way through its
pages.

Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Why is training necessary?
Every year, most organizations budget money for training — over 50 billion
dollars in the United States alone. The volume of money and effort suggests
that corporations believe training is important. What do they know about
training that justifies this much investment? For starters, training plays an
important role in developing a productive workforce and finely tuning
processes to increase profits. Training also helps people and organizations
manage change. Because organizations are continuously changing tech-
niques, goals, equipment, people, and locations, all members of the work-
force require training to support these changes.
There are four critical aspects of a coordinated comprehensive training
approach. In the most efficient organizations, the four are aligned toward the
same corporate goals.

Chapter 1: What’s a Trainer?
A brief history lesson
Training has been around since the Stone Age.
It’s not likely that train-the-trainer seminars
existed in 2000 B.C. Yet without some natural
way to transfer skills and knowledge, people
would never have progressed from the first
wheel on a muddy road to the computer chips
that guide our exploration of outer space.
Probably the first documented training occurred
in the 18th century, when artisans and crafts-
men formed apprenticeships that utilized a
demonstration-practice-feedback-practice-
again process.
It wasn’t until 1944 that training was orga-
nized under one banner, The American Society
for Training Directors (later changing its name
to The American Society for Training and
Development, and known simply as ASTD).
Two influential professionals helped to shape
the early years of the profession. Malcolm
Knowles advanced the idea of andragogy, a
learning theory for adults, distinct from peda-
gogy for children. This tipped the scale toward
a more learner-centered approach as opposed
to a content-centered approach. Len Nadler
coined the term Human Resource Development
and added structure and organization to the
field.
The 1990s found many practitioners desiring to
officially expand the field of training to incorpo-
rate identifying business goals at the top of the
organization and ensuring that systems were in
place to support the change required to achieve
the business goals. Proponents felt that the field
should include both non-learning as well as
learning interventions (including traditional
training activities). They also believed that the
new model should measure its success based
on performance. 
But what to call this newly expanded field?
Perhaps, Workplace Learning and Performance.
Dana and Jim Robinson have led the practical
implementation of these concepts to the field of
training. They have been influential in helping
others to understand the difference between
learning and performance and how a trainer’s
role has expanded.

 There is a business need or requirement. This is the starting point.
Effective training starts with the clarification (or creation) of organiza-
tional goals. This enables the training department to provide a strategic
approach to the services it offers the organization. Examples of business
needs include increasing customer satisfaction, increasing market share,
and improving quality.
 There is a need to improve or change performance. Performance is
usually tied to a specific job and a task or set of tasks within that job. It
is what the employee must do to achieve the organizational goal. For
example, if improving quality is a business goal, each employee must
know what process to use to ensure delivery of a quality product or ser-
vice.
 There is a need to gain knowledge or to learn new skills. In order to
change performance, employees may need to learn something new. This
learning may take many forms such as coaching, classroom training,
computer-based training (CBT), on-the-job training (OJT), or self-study.
 There is a need for change in the environment. At times, employees may
possess the skills and knowledge required to change their performance,
but some aspect of the environment either prevents or discourages indi-
viduals from making the change. For example, if an organization’s goal is
to improve quality, there will be little change if the reward system focuses
on quantity, not quality.
Trainers are involved in providing services that address all these aspects.
If you’re a beginning trainer, you’ll most likely start with interventions that
deliver knowledge and new skills (the third bullet in the preceding list). This
is the traditional “training” role. However, as you grow professionally, you
may be required to provide training for all of the other needs that affect an
organization.
What do organizations expect to accomplish by investing in training efforts?
They desire change in performance of employees in order to:
 Reduce employee turnover
 Maintain current customers
 Create new customers
 Increase customer satisfaction
 Reduce errors
 Reduce expenses
 Save time
 Add dollars to the bottom line
10
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

There are many reasons people require training in the workplace. Some of
these reasons include: 
 Orient new employees
 Provide long-term professional development
 Upgrade knowledge required for the job
 Introduce new skills to experienced employees
 Change career paths due to job elimination
But won’t trainers run out of people to train? Not likely. Organizations are
required to continually make changes. Technology advances continue to
influence how trainers do their jobs. The skilled labor pool continues to
shrink worldwide. Thousands of new employees enter the workforce every
week. That keeps at least a few trainers busy.
11
Chapter 1: What’s a Trainer?
Training is experiencing growing pains
As training enters the 21st century, the training
field is experiencing growing pains in three
ways. 
 The field of training is expanding its role.
In the “Why is training necessary?” section
earlier in this chapter, I mention the impor-
tance of aligning the four requirements of
the organization when budgeting for train-
ing: business, performance, learning, and
environmental needs. This alignment is one
of the important aspects that the Workplace
Learning and Performance movement has
brought to the field of training.
 The field is indecisive about what to call
itself. At this time, the training profession is
having an identity crisis — partially brought
on by the expanded role. Whether it will be
called Training and Development, Human
Resource Development, or Workplace
Learning and Performance is yet to be seen.
But that doesn’t bring the practitioners to a
halt. Training must go on!
 Certification is finally available for those
practicing in the field. This is beneficial
because it provides the credentials to sup-
port the training field and adds credibility to
the professional trainer. ASTD administers
the process and approved the effort as this
book went to press in early 2005. Details for
how you can be certified as a Workplace
Learning and Performance professional
are available from ASTD. You may wish to
begin to find out more about the ASTD
Certification design by checking the ASTD
Web site at www.astd.org. Also check
out Chapter 16. 
What’s causing the growing pains? The evolu-
tion has to do with the difference between
activity and results. In the past, the best mea-
sure of training was how many people were
trained. Today, the measures go beyond the
training room and directly to those things that
affect the bottom line: increased productivity,
improved sales, better quality, fewer errors,
decreased employee turnover, and others.
Businesses are finding ways to measure the
effects of training on the business and are inter-
ested in their return on investment (ROI).

Is training just for business?
You experience training in other parts of your life in addition to the work-
place. For example, you may decide you want to play the piano or practice
yoga. You may want to find out more about your ancestors or Italian artists. If
so, you’ll likely locate someone who teaches these subjects at your local col-
lege, community center, or in the Yellow Pages. In this way, individuals seek
training for a variety of reasons outside the workplace:
 Learn new skills (try a new hobby such as painting or growing bonsai)
 Enhance skills you already have (take a tennis lesson to improve your
game or a gourmet-cooking lesson to learn new techniques)
 Acquire knowledge about a subject that interests you (attend a class
about African history or investing in the stock market)
 Gain information you require due to a life change (attend a class to learn
to care for your elderly parent or learn how to prepare for retirement)
Training is available for all areas of your life.
What Do Trainers Do? 
The trainers’ roles, they are a changing, and many new roles are currently
being defined in the training arena. The following list provides just a sample
of the trainer roles and titles that are emerging.
12
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 
 Career coach
 Chief learning officer
 Competency expert
 Computer-based training
designer
 Continuous learning coach
 Corporate trainer
 Courseware designer
 Curriculum development 
specialist
 Employee development 
specialist
 Executive coach
 Facilitator
 Instructional designer
 Instructional technologist
 Instructor
 Knowledge manager
 Leadership trainer
 Manager of strategic initiatives
 Media designer
 Multimedia engineer
 Organization development 
specialist
 Performance analyst

Even though the preceding list uses wildly different words and appears to be
quite diverse, all of these roles play a part in ensuring that people gain knowl-
edge or skills, or change attitudes. In the “Why is training necessary?” section
earlier in this chapter, I mention that beginning trainers usually start with
interventions that design and deliver knowledge and new skills. This tradi-
tional “training” role remains the mainstay of the training field. In addition,
classroom training continues to be the most used delivery method, hovering
around 70 percent. Technology in the form of computer-based training (no
instructor) and instructor-led training from a remote site (via Web conferenc-
ing or videoconferencing) have each grown slightly — around one percent —
each year since 2000. 
The two roles (design and delivery) can be further subdivided into two main
categories. All training professionals are involved with designing and/or pre-
senting a learning experience. Whether you design, deliver, or do a bit of
both, you have two aspects to master: content and process.
 Content: Whether you’re designing or presenting, you need to truly
understand what others need to know about the topic. Get inside the
topic and find out more than what’s offered in your instructor’s manual.
Ask more questions of more people if you’re designing. Talk to subject
matter experts, often called SMEs in the training world. The content is
based on your organization’s needs.
 Process: Both design and delivery have methods that you incorporate
into your training task. Design methods incorporate skills such as
designing participant materials, incorporating adult learning principles,
and selecting methods for the perfect blended learning program.
Delivery methods incorporate skills such as facilitating group process,
presentation skills, and managing disruptive participants. 
This book provides tips and techniques for both content and process.
Assessing your training potential 
Every career has its own set of characteristics that increase the chances that
someone will enjoy the job and have a natural aptitude for the work that is
done. The following list identifies a number of those characteristics for a
trainer.
 Able to relate to specific situations
 Assertive and influencing
13
Chapter 1: What’s a Trainer?
 Performance consultant
 Performance technologist
 Performance improvement
technologist
 Technical trainer
 Training leader
 Workforce diversity director

 Both logical and creative
 Builds trust
 Confident and poised
 Customer-focused
 Enjoys presenting information; articulate
 Enthusiastic
 Excellent communicator (verbal and written)
 Flexible and spontaneous
 Good listener
 Impartial and objective
 Lifelong learner
 Patient
 People-oriented, warm, and approachable
 Process-oriented
 Self-sufficient
 Sense of humor
 Solution- and results-oriented
 Strong business sense
 Team player and partners well
 Tolerant of ambiguity
 Well-organized
Examine the list of characteristics. Which of these are natural for you? Which
do you need to work harder at to be a successful and satisfied trainer? 
Take stock of your skills
In addition to natural aptitude, every job also requires a specific skill set. The
skills required of a trainer are many and varied. ASTD completed a Competency
Study for the Workplace Learning and Performance profession in 2004. This
study identified the roles, competencies, and areas of expertise for the pro-
fession. The Competency Study further defines the skills that are required. The
Training Knowledge and Skills Inventory that follows incorporates these skills.
Complete the Training Knowledge and Skills Inventory in Table 1-1 to identify
your current strengths and the skills you need to improve to perform your job
effectively. This activity assists you in setting specific objectives for your pro-
fessional development. 
14
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Complete this inventory by evaluating your ability to perform each skill using
two rating scales. You evaluate each skill from two perspectives. In Column 1
you rate your ability, and in Column 2 you rate the importance of the skill to
your particular job.

So how did you do? Perhaps you did not know what some of the skills meant.
That’s okay for now. Each is more clearly defined throughout the book.
Take a few minutes to review the inventory you completed. First put a plus
(+) next to the items for which you rated yourself at 5. These are the talents
that form a foundation for your role as a trainer. Circle your three strongest in
Table 1-1.
Next total Column 1. The maximum score is 200. In general a score of 150 or
more indicates a well-rounded, proficient trainer. Not there? Not to worry.
That’s what this book is all about.

Next subtract Column 2 from Column 1 for each of the 40 skills. Write the 
difference in Column 3. Note that you have a negative number if Column 2
has a larger number than Column 1. If the difference is negative, it means
that the task is important in your job and your skill level may not measure
up. These areas clearly need improvement. Put squares around them in

the lowest numbers.
Your results provide you with a general direction for skills and knowledge
you may wish to acquire.
The 2004 ASTD Competency Study provides a more extensive discussion
of the skills and an explanation of the different skills required for other roles
in the Workplace Learning and Performance profession. ASTD offers classes
and other learning opportunities for new trainers or trainers desiring to brush
up on their skills.
How do you become a trainer?
There are as many paths to a career in training as there are types of training.
Many trainers, like me, can tell you they “came in the back door.” I was a
trainer for over a year before I realized that training was a profession in its
own right. Because training became a collateral duty to the “real” job I had, I
didn’t consider that someone may have studied the training process to
ensure effectiveness! It was only after I started messing around with the cur-
riculum and experimenting with various training methodologies that my
research led me to an entire body of knowledge. Until then, I thought I was
inventing Adult Learning Theory! I must admit I was a bit disappointed when I
first discovered Malcolm Knowles!
Most trainers work for organizations in other departments. They may drift
over to the performance improvement department or the human resources
department and apply for a job. Sometime they have taken a class and decide
they want to be at the training end of the classroom rather than the learner
end. In other cases they may have been tapped to conduct training on a
new product, service, or procedure. Enjoying the experience, they followed
up on how to do it full time. Some individuals enroll in adult learning degree
programs.
No matter how you have gotten to this point in your career, and whether
you’re a part-time trainer, full-time trainer, or wannabe trainer, remember that
a professional certification is available to you through ASTD, providing you
with the foundation for becoming a trainer.

Chapter 1: What’s a Trainer?

A Day in the Life of a Trainer
What’s a typical day in the life of a trainer like? For most trainers, every day
is different, so atypical is probably a better description. Here’s what happens
if you follow Jose for a day: 
Jose has been with Honesty Parts and Services (HPS) for several years.
He started out in the marketing department but enjoyed one of his inter-
personal communications classes so much that he decided to apply for a
job as a trainer in the human performance improvement department. 
Jose’s director reports to the Chief Learning Officer, who works with
other leaders in the organization to determine a strategic direction and
goals. Everything that the department does is aligned with the organiza-
tion’s strategic direction. When one of the department heads contacted
Jose’s director requesting the department to design a training program,
she first checked to ensure alignment. Next she conducted a performance
assessment. After she determined that training was the solution, she
turned the project over to Jose and a team that included an instructional
designer, a subject matter expert, and a computer-based training designer. 
Jose and his team spent the last few weeks designing a blended training
program that would meet the needs of the department. The team started
with the assessment results, conducted additional research on the topic,
and interviewed additional people in the department. They considered
the content, time available, the audience, and the locations. As a result,
they designed a classroom module that included participant materials
and a PowerPoint presentation, follow-up self-paced e-learning content,
and a job aid. Jose put in long hours during the design and development
stage.
The program pilot, a trial run, for the classroom module has been sched-
uled for today. Yesterday Jose and his team finalized the session materials,
set up the room, checked out the audiovisual equipment, and arranged
for lunch to be brought in from the cafeteria. 
This morning, Jose arrived at the training site an hour before the session
so that he could be certain everything was ready to go. Participants started
arriving 45 minutes before the sessions started. As he introduced himself
to individuals, he learned that many of them were uncertain of the location
and that this was a first training opportunity for a few. The early arrivals
did not give him any time to himself, so Jose was glad that he spent the
past week preparing for the session. He had practiced the materials out
loud, conducted a dry run with his team, tried out the activities with his
peers, and even delivered some of the content to his family. He felt ready.
Jose had told his wife that he would be late getting home tonight.
Following the session, which ends at 4:30 p.m., his team will meet to cri-
tique the day and to determine whether any adjustments need to be
made in the agenda or the content for the next day. 
20
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Following the two-day session, he and his team will make any minor mod-
ifications to the session based on feedback from the participants, ensure
that participants use the follow-up materials, follow up with the depart-
ment head, and begin to schedule the other classes locally and at remote
sites. He will travel overnight for several of the sessions but is looking for-
ward to seeing some of the organization’s branch offices. 
Now, at 7:59 a.m., Jose looked out to the participants before starting. He
felt satisfied that he was in a position to contribute to HPS’s bottom line
and that he had a job that gave him so much pleasure and satisfaction.
With those thoughts on his mind, he smiled at the group and said, “Good
morning!” 
Do You Have What It Takes?
Although training may seem like a glamorous profession to an observer, like
any other profession, it has its hidden challenges. Having the skills to be a
trainer is only one prerequisite. A much more difficult requirement for a suc-
cessful trainer is to have strong mental and emotional composure. Training is
a demanding profession. It requires constant energy output. If you tire quickly,
become discouraged easily, or become frustrated if things do not go according
to plan, training may not be for you. Here are some aspects to consider about
training.
 Are you willing to work longer than an 8-hour day? Even though a
training program may be scheduled from 9 to 5, you may find yourself
going to the training room much earlier than 9:00 a.m. and staying much
later than 5:00 p.m. A well-prepared training session takes thoughtful
room and material setup. If you arrive at the training room at the same
time as the trainees, you will feel disorganized and unprepared. You may
even start late because of last-minute preparations.
 Are you also willing to stay later than your official “ending” time?
The same principle applies after the training program has ended. It is
usually the trainer’s responsibility to ensure that all items you used
for the training are removed from the training room. You may need to
replace tables and chairs the way you found them. You may need to
straighten the room. Also, many trainees stay after the program is over
so that they can ask questions they did not wish to ask in front of the
rest of the participants. They expect the trainer to be there cheerfully
ready to answer their questions. In addition, you may have many details
to wrap up at the end of the day: add notes to your training manual,
review your PowerPoint presentation for the next day, clean your trans-
parencies, revise your schedule for the next day, complete administra-
tive tasks, file your materials in order, send additional resources to a
participant, or prepare a flip chart for the next day. 
21
Chapter 1: What’s a Trainer?

 Can you stand on your feet all day? Trainers do not often have the
opportunity to sit down. Because they are facilitating the program in one
way or another, they stand during all presentations and during most dis-
cussions. Even when the participants are in small groups, trainers move
from group to group ready to answer questions, address problems, or
know when to move on to the next subject.
 Even if you can literally stand on your feet all day, can you figura-
tively stand on your feet all day? No amount of preparation can equip a
trainer for everything that can happen in a training session. The trainer
must be prepared to respond to unexpected questions and events. A
trainer must be flexible. Sometimes, the planned agenda doesn’t fit the
needs of the audience. A good trainer adjusts the agenda and changes
the material so that it meets the needs of the audience. An effective
trainer also reads the audience and adjusts the level of the training to fit
the level of the audience.
 Can you perform even when you feel lousy? Trainers don’t often have
the discretion to call in sick. When a session is scheduled, it often has
been done long in advance, and often learners travel from long distances
to attend training. Therefore, trainers must be able to present enthusias-
tically even when they are a little under the weather. The show must go on!
 Are you prepared to constantly give of yourself without expecting to
receive anything in return? Trainers are often viewed by others as
“healers” — those people who always have the answers and who can
perform “magic.” Conversely, trainers are not often perceived as people
who have their own needs. As a result, participants may use your train-
ing program to get some bad feelings off their chests. Giving may extend
to time as well, such as having time for breaks and lunch that may be
used by participants wanting to discuss their personal situations.
 Can you be the perfect role model all the time? It is a trainer’s job to
teach the “right” way to do things. You must also be prepared to prac-
tice what you preach. Trainers run the risk of losing their credibility if
they are not perceived to be a perfect example of what they teach. And,
because no one is perfect, trainers must also admit it when they make a
mistake. Trainers cannot allow participants to leave a training session
with incorrect information.
 Can you cope with constant logistic problems? Even though it may be
someone else’s responsibility to make room and equipment arrange-
ments, it becomes the trainer’s problem if something is not right. Are
you prepared to deal with malfunctioning equipment, rooms that are not
set up, reservations clerks who say you never reserved a room, materi-
als that do not arrive, materials that have been typed or collated incor-
rectly, or any mess-up in general? A good trainer takes full accountability
for ensuring that all logistics of a training program are in order.
22
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

 Can you be a big lug? Although it would be nice to have all the training
materials, supplies, and equipment just magically show up at the train-
ing site, it is more likely that you will be the person responsible for get-
ting it all there. Packing, loading, unloading, and unpacking (and then
doing it all over again) is simply a part of a trainer’s job.
 Are you prepared to encourage your participants even when there is
a lack of management commitment? Sometimes, people are sent to
training because their managers think that it is “a good thing to do.”
There may be little serious commitment to support and encourage these
employees when the training is completed. Can you provide support and
understanding in the absence of managers’ commitment?
 Can you deliver hard feedback? Trainees do not learn effectively if
during their training process they are not given honest feedback. Are
you able to give this feedback, even when it is not good and even if it
may impact an employee’s job?
 Are you able to process failure, identify solutions, and make improve-
ments? Not every training program is a smashing success. In fact, some
are downright bad. Successful trainers are those who analyze what went
wrong in the bad sessions and then design changes in the program so
that it improves the next time around.
Many of the preceding questions are certainly not meant to discourage you,
but rather to introduce the reality of a sometimes glamorous-appearing job. It
may be challenging. It usually requires a great deal of work. And it can be rid-
dled with problems. However, you forget all the difficulties when former par-
ticipants tell you that “you changed their lives.” Or that “you inspired them.”
Of course this doesn’t happen on a weekly basis, but it does happen often
enough to make it all worthwhile.
Yes, training is a demanding, sometimes hectic, often ambiguous job. There is
never a dull moment. It is exciting. It is the catalyst for improvement. It is the
process to the future. Training exists to facilitate change and to encourage
transformation for a better future. The late Christa McAuliffe, teacher and
NASA astronaut, summed it up this way: “I touch the future; I teach.”

hink back to the past 60 days. What is one thing you learned?
Before reading ahead, try to recall what you learned and why you learned it.
Perhaps you learned to play racquetball because you always wanted to learn
to play the game. Perhaps you had a flat tire on the way home, and you had
to learn to change the tire because you had to do it. You didn’t want to, but
you had no choice. 
If you’re like most adults, you learn to do most things as an adult because
you want to learn it or you need to learn it. 
This chapter explores adult learning theory, how people learn, and how train-
ers can assist participants to learn in the classroom.
Adult Learning Theory
Trainers are most successful when they understand conditions under which
adults learn best. Therefore, it is important to understand the difference
between why adults learn and how adults are traditionally taught.
The traditional style of teaching is based on a didactic model, a synonym for
lecturing. Generally this model is teacher-led and content-centered. Another
word used is pedagogy, which literally means the art of teaching children.
In the introduction to this chapter, you discovered that most adults learn
things because they want to or need to. Children do, too. However, children’s
formal learning is usually led by someone else and is based on their learning
specific tasks to prepare them to learn additional, more complicated tasks.

For example, you learned to count to 100 in kindergarten so that you could
learn to add and subtract in first grade, so that you could learn to multiply
and divide in third grade, so that you could learn algebra in eighth grade, so
that you could learn trigonometry in high school, so that you could learn 
calculus in college.
Most people have experienced the pedagogical model of learning. It has dom-
inated education for centuries and assumes the following:
 The instructor is the expert. Because the learner has little experience, it
is up to the instructor to impart wisdom.
 The instructor is responsible for all aspects of the learning process,
including what, how, and when the learners learn.
 Learning is content-centered. Objectives establish goals, and a logical
sequence of material is presented to the learners.
 Motivation is external, and learners learn because they must reach the
next level of understanding, pass a test, or acquire certification.
Does this sound familiar? It should. Unless you had an atypical learning situa-
tion, it is most likely how you were taught starting in kindergarten and
through college. Some schools are changing however. Although the lecture
method is still used, it is frequently enhanced with other learning methods.
This suggests that someone has identified a better method for teaching.
Who is Malcolm Knowles?
Malcolm Knowles is considered the father of adult learning theory. Because
pedagogy is defined as the art and science of teaching children, European
adult educators coined the word andragogy to identify the growing body of
knowledge about adult learning. It was Dr. Knowles’ highly readable book,
The Adult Learner: A Neglected Species, published in 1973, that took the topic
from theoretical to practical. Table 2-1 compares the differences between
andragogy and pedagogy. Trainers and adult educators began to implement
practical applications based on Dr. Knowles’ six assumptions. 
The following list summarizes Malcolm Knowles’ six assumptions and adds a
practical application from a trainer’s perspective. Although there is some
duplication of ideas, I have presented all six assumptions to you as Knowles
identified them. Many authors distill the six to five, four, and even three.
 Adults have a need to know why they should learn something before
investing time in a learning event. Trainers must ensure that the learners
know the purpose for training as early as possible.
 Adults enter any learning situation with an image of themselves as self-
directing, responsible grown-ups. Trainers must help adults identify
their needs and direct their own learning experience.
26
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

 Adults come to a learning opportunity with a wealth of experience and a
great deal to contribute. Trainers are successful when they identify ways
to build on and make use of adults’ hard-earned experience.
 Adults have a strong readiness to learn those things that help them cope
with daily life effectively. Training that relates directly to situations
adults face is viewed as relevant.
 Adults are willing to devote energy to learning those things that they
believe help them perform a task or solve a problem. Trainers who
determine needs and interests and develop content in response to these
needs are most helpful to adult learners.
 Adults are more responsive to internal motivators such as increased self-
esteem than external motivators such as higher salaries. Trainers can
ensure that this internal motivation is not blocked by barriers such as a
poor self-concept or time constraints by creating a safe learning climate.

Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn

responsibility. Furthermore, whether you’re the trainer or the learner you
have responsibility to ensure that the training is successful, that learning
occurs, and that change takes place.
If you’re the trainer
 Create a learning environment that is safe.
 Be organized, have well-defined objectives, and establish a clear direc-
tion for your session based on the participants’ needs. Be so well orga-
nized that it is easy to be flexible when the participants’ needs are
different from what you anticipated.
 Ensure that your content is meaningful and transferable to the learners’
world.
 Treat your learners with respect, understanding, and genuine concern.
 Invite learners to share their knowledge and experiences.
If you’re the learner
 Be an active learner, participating in the interactive exercises.
 Be critical of poorly defined sessions, an unprepared trainer, or processes
that prevent your learning; provide constructive feedback to the trainer.
 Ensure your personal success by encouraging feedback from the trainer.
Delivering constructive feedback is a key action expected of all professional
trainers. Learners have a right to receive feedback from their trainers.
 Recognize that you’re responsible for your own learning, so ensure that
all your questions are answered.
 Contribute to your own success by clearly identifying a learning plan for
yourself; then do your part to achieve your objectives.
Trainers beware! Note that I encourage learners to be critical of you if you’re
not prepared or the session doesn’t meet their needs. Why? Professional
trainers profess to build on the foundation of adult learning theory. If some-
thing is not working, step back, determine why, and fix it. If you’re not doing
that, you’re not practicing good adult learning principles. You may need
another trainer to guide you.
How Do People Learn?
The adult learning theory presented in the previous section provides a foun-
dation of principles of adult learning. However, there are additional consider-
ations to enhance results when training adults. In the following sections, I

Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn
Bloom’s Taxonomy
In the early ’60s, Benjamin Bloom and a univer-
sity committee identified three learning domains:
cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. Because
the project was completed by university folks,
the terms may seem a bit abstract.
Trainers typically use knowledge (cognitive),
skills (psychomotor), and attitude (affective) to
describe the three categories of learning. In
addition, trainers frequently refer to these three
learning categories as the KSAs. You may think
of these as the ultimate goals of the training
process — what your learner acquires as a
result of training.
Bloom’s group further expanded on the domains.
They created a hierarchical ordering of the cog-
nitive and affective learning outcomes. Their
work subdivided each domain, starting from the
simplest behavior to the most complex: Knowl-
edge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis,
Synthesis, and Evaluation. Each of these levels
builds on the earlier one. For example, knowl-
edge must occur prior to comprehension; com-
prehension must occur before application. Each
level of learning identified the desired specific,
observable, and measurable result.
This work is known as Bloom’s Taxonomy. The
divisions are not absolutes, and other systems
and hierarchies have been developed since
then. Bloom’s Taxonomy, however, is easily
understood and may be the most widely applied.
The following table explains what it means.

It is interesting to note that although the com-
mittee actually identified three domains of
learning, they applied the six levels to only the
cognitive and affective learning domains. They
did not elaborate on psychomotor (skills). Their
explanation for this was that they had little
experience teaching manual skills at the college
level. 

Three types of learning: KSAs
Trainers address three types of learning: knowledge (K), skills (S), and influ-
encing attitude (A). Trainers frequently shorten this to the KSA acronym. (If
you want the research to support this, it is called Bloom’s Taxonomy.) 
Knowledge (Bloom called this cognitive) involves the development of intellec-
tual skills. Examples of knowledge include understanding the principles of
accounting, knowing the stages of childhood, understanding how interest
rates affect the economy, or knowing how to get a book published.
Skills (Bloom called this psychomotor) refers to physical movement, coordina-
tion, and the use of the motor-skills area. Examples of skills you may learn
include the ability to use a digital camera, operate a backhoe, supervise staff,
listen effectively, or kick a soccer ball.
Attitude (Bloom called this affective) refers to how you deal with things emo-
tionally, such as feelings, motivation, and enthusiasm. Although attitude is
not “taught,” training may affect it. Trainers cannot change attitudes, but
they frequently have the opportunity to influence attitudes. 
Trainers sometimes discuss whether it is the learner’s skill or will that pre-
vents topnotch performance following a training session. This refers to the
fact that an employee may have learned the skill but is unwilling to use it.
Therefore, the real reason an employee may not be using what was learned
may not be skill-based at all. It may be that the employee won’t use the skill
that was learned.
Knowing that there are three types of learning means that you need to use
different methods to address each. I discuss this in more depth in Chapter 5
when I address design.
Other considerations for learning
How do you gain information? Hear? See? Do you also touch? Smell and taste,
too? You bet you do! We all gain information through our five senses. The
highest percent of information usually comes through seeing and hearing. 
Many people have theories about how humans learn best. David Kolb, for
example, presents four learning styles: the converger, the diverger, the assim-
ilator, and the accommodator. Another theory was developed by W. E. (Ned)
Herrmann. His research shows brain specialization in four quadrants and
that each quadrant has its own preferred way of learning. Ned’s daughter Ann
Herrmann-Nehdi continues to enhance her father’s work.

Still a third theory, Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), proposes that everyone
takes information in through three modalities: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
Most people use a combination of all three modalities. Preferred learning styles
determine how your participants assimilate, sort, retain, retrieve, and repro-
duce new information.
Visual learners, for example, prefer pictures, diagrams, and other visuals.
They probably need to “see it” to “know it.” They may have artistic ability
and a strong sense of color. They may have difficulty following directions or
learning from lectures. They may overreact to noise or misinterpret words.
How can you create a learning environment that is conducive for the visual
learner? Consider these suggestions.
 Provide written directions when possible.
 Enhance presentations with visuals, graphics, illustrations, diagrams,
props, or flowcharts.
 Create a colorful classroom with neon sticky-back notes, posters, color-
ful and coordinated markers, crayons, and participant materials.
 Provide paper (colorful) and markers for doodling and taking notes.
 Help participants visualize a process using films, demonstrations, or role
plays to “show” how.
 Color code participant materials or use icons to help them find their way.
Auditory learners, on the other hand, prefer to get information by listening.
They need to “hear it” to “know it.” They may have difficulty following written
directions or any activity that includes reading.
How can you create a learning environment that is conducive for the auditory
learner? Consider these suggestions.
 Provide spoken directions, when possible.
 Use discussions, tapes, debates, panels, interviews, and other verbal
methods for transferring knowledge.
 Plan for buzz groups, small group discussion, teach-backs, and presenta-
tions that allow participants to talk through the information.
 Avoid using subtle body language or facial expression to make a point.
 Create learning activities in which learners repeat the information.
Finally, kinesthetic learners prefer hands-on learning. They need to “do it” to
“know it.” They assemble things without reading directions and usually have
good spatial perception. They learn best when they are actively involved.
31
Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn

How can you create a learning environment that is conducive for the kines-
thetic learner? Consider these suggestions.
 Provide physically active learning opportunities.
 Engage them in experiential, hands-on learning activities.
 Provide things for them to touch and “play with” such as Play Doh, tac-
tile toys, koosh balls, and crayons.
 Take frequent breaks or allow informal movement during the session
that doesn’t disturb other participants.
 Build in activities such as making models, role playing, scavenger hunts,
relay races, and other active review and practice methods.
 Use computers to reinforce learning.
 Find ways other than testing to express knowledge and skills, such as
demonstrations.
You usually encounter all of these learning styles in a training session at one
time.
So what does a trainer do? It is not usually possible to address all the learning
preferences all the time in a group. Do what all good trainers do.
 Accept that people learn in different ways.
 Use different methods that facilitate learning for different preferences.
 And, finally, when designing or delivering training, strive to create a vari-
ety of approaches that utilize techniques and activities from all learning
preferences. 
Helping Adults Learn in the Classroom
You may have a difficult time finding practical advice to ensure that the train-
ing room — your workplace — maximizes adult learning. However, in 25
years of experience in classrooms, I’ve discovered practical tips for applying
Malcolm Knowles’ principles to ensure that participants learn. I’ve grouped
them in four categories for you.
 Create a safe haven for learning.
 Create a comfortable environment.
 Encourage participation.
 Facilitate more than you lecture.
In the following sections, I examine each of these and help you decide how
you can address them.
32
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Create a safe haven for learning
It would be great if everything you did as a trainer went just the way it was 
supposed to, but it won’t. Trust me. Some learners may arrive thinking that
training is punishment. Others may arrive with memories of past learning
experiences in mind, such as failing tests. Yet others may arrive bringing
their daily burdens with them. You can create a safe haven for everyone by
using some of these ideas.
 Be prepared early enough so that you can greet participants at the door,
welcome them, learn their names, and allow time for them to tell you
something that’s important to them. 
 Share the objectives of the training early, prior to the session, if possible.
 Let participants know how they stand to benefit from the information.
 Demonstrate your respect for each individual.
 Ensure confidentiality — “what’s said in the room stays in the room.”
 Add something whimsical to pique curiosity and add a smile. This may
be crayons, clay, koosh balls, or manipulative toys.
 Use names and sincere reinforcement to build rapport.
I like to use table tents (card stock folded in half length-wise) on which par-
ticipants write their names. Some trainers prefer to use name badges.
Whatever your choice, be sure that you can read them. For example, ask par-
ticipants to write their first names large enough so that everyone can read
them from across the room. If you use preprinted table tents, ensure that the
type size is bold and can be read from 40 feet. Also, if water glasses are
placed on the tables, bunch them up in one spot so that participants take
them as they need them. Otherwise, there will be one sitting in front of each
table tent, and you will be unable to read the names.
Create a comfortable environment
I prefer to arrive in a training room early enough to make it mine so that I can
welcome the learners in as my guests. As a trainer, be sensitive to the mood
of the room — created by both the physical aspects as well as each partici-
pant’s demeanor. To create a comfortable environment, consider these
suggestions before your next training session.
 Turn the lights on bright. There is nothing more depressing to me than
walking into a ballroom where the lights have been left on romantic dim
from the party the night before.
Ask for a room with natural light. Even on a sunless day, natural light is
more pleasant than any artificial lighting.
33
Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn

 Learn how to adjust the thermostat for the most comfortable level for
most of the participants. Remember, you can never please all of them all
the time. Do your best.
 Ensure that the environment “looks” comfortable. Hide empty boxes.
Chairs should be straight. Place materials neatly and uniformly at each
seat. This order tells the learners that you care and went to the trouble
of getting ready for them.
 Ensure that you and your visuals can be seen and heard by all learners.
Go ahead try it out. Sit in their seats. Will all participants be able to see
your visuals and hear you?
 Arrange to have the most comfortable chairs available.
 Arrange the tables to be conducive to learning. Chapter 7 provides a
number of suggestions.
 Ensure that everyone has adequate personal space.
 Have extra supplies, pens, and paper available.
 Have coffee, tea, and water waiting in the morning.
 Plan for ample breaks.

Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 
Learning with style: Seven things trainers do
by Ann Herrmann-Nehdi
It has been widely established that people have
preferred learning styles and teaching styles, so
what is a trainer to do in response? 
 Expect difference! Research has shown
that men and women, different age groups,
different brain dominance styles, and dif-
ferent personalities all learn differently! If
you design and train knowing that your
learners all process information differently,
you won’t be caught off guard and will be
better equipped from the start to respond to
those differing styles. 
Do some research about your learners to
better know in advance how diverse they
may be. Look for data on occupations, age,
gender, culture, and anything you can learn
about their background. Look for ways to
make links in your content to the different
interests and backgrounds you’re working
with. Brain research has shown that the
more the context fits with your learning, the
better your learners will remember what
you have taught .
 Do not follow the Golden Rule. Most kids
grew up being told to “do to others as you
want them to do to you.” Why ignore the
Golden Rule? The way you like to learn may
be opposite from the way your learners like
to learn. It is easy to assume that everyone
will find your approach as interesting as you
do. Think of the times you were frustrated
with the style of an instructor or trainer!
Don’t let that happen to your learners!
Look for new ideas by observing other train-
ers doing similar content, how do they
approach it? Ask your group about they way
they prefer to learn; get them involved. Try
cofacilitating and designing with a partner
who does things differently. 

35
Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn
 Remember to be a learner yourself! How
easy it is to forget what it is like to be a par-
ticipant. Putting yourself into learning situa-
tions will provide you with a very good
reminder. Be willing to experiment, attend
programs, and stay current with new
approaches and techniques you can learn
by observing others in action. It is very easy
to get stuck in a “rut” and teach a program
you know well the same way every time. 
Sign up for conferences (check out www.
vnulearning.com/about-trg.htm
or www.astd.org) and go to a wide vari-
ety of sessions, network with others in the
training profession, and attend as many
learning experiences as you can.
 Give learners enough time to learn. It is
very important to provide time for applica-
tion and practice in different formats. Brain
studies have shown that in order for learn-
ing to “stick” in memory, many learners
need “mental rehearsal,” time to apply and
practice. If you have a learner who is learn-
ing outside of his/her preferred style, this
time is even more critical. Too often, in
today’s hurried world, people eliminate or
shorten the time needed to apply, practice,
and “rehearse” mentally what has been
learned. 
Provide context-specific practice to allow
learners to take in the learning in their own 
formats and contexts. Be sure to allow
for questions and clarification after the
practice.
 Watch your reactions — both verbal and
nonverbal. Gestures, tone, facial expres-
sions, and eye contact are all taken in by
your audience, often at a subconscious
level. You may be inadvertently reacting in
a negative way to a learner with a style you
find uncomfortable.
Videotape yourself and observe your verbal
and nonverbal reactions — especially to
learners whom you may find irritating or 
different — and/or get feedback from
others. It may be necessary to practice
changing your expression, tone, or ges-
tures.
 Don’t load your questions. Many questions
are preloaded with the answer and may be
only suited to a specific type of learner. Ask
questions in varied ways and give enough
time for answers. Questions provide a great
opportunity for learners to participate. 
Think of as many ways as you can to ask
questions. Observe other trainers. Have a
partner capture the type of questions you
typically ask and look for variety the next
time you train. Be aware that leaving a five-
second pause after the question provides a
much greater opportunity for your learners
to process and respond more effectively.
You may also find ways to draw in other
learners who are not as quick to offer an
answer.
 Multiple ways of training equals multiple
learning options. Too often, trainers train
with only one approach — it may be com-
fortable, what you’re used to, or just what
you have had available. Examples may
include PowerPoint slides with text bullets,
lectures, games, discussion, and so on.
To honor different learning styles, it is
essential 
to 
use 
different 
delivery
approaches. Experiment with different
ways to get across your learning messages. 
Use a whole-brain approach. For the
Left Brain, use lecture, theories, data, case
studies, problem-solving activities, and
debate for logical learners; use outlines,
structured quizzes, reference material,
step-by-step practice, and detailed study
for structured learners. For the Right Brain,
use collaborative activities, role play, pre-
sentations, writing, and music for interper-
sonal learners. For holistic learners, try
visualization, games, creative activities,
props, metaphors and visuals, conceptual
models, and brainstorming.

Encourage participation
I believe that creating active and ample participation is the most important
thing you can do to enhance learning. You find this thread running through
the entire book. Here are a couple of thoughts to get you started.
 Use small break-out groups to overcome any reluctance to share ideas
or concerns.
 Use participants’ names as often as possible.
 Use body language to encourage participation; positive nods, smiles,
and eye contact all show that you’re interested in others’ ideas.
 Share something of yourself to begin a trusted exchange of ideas.
 Learn and apply techniques to get learners to open up. You’ll discover
numerous ideas later in this book.
Facilitate more than you lecture
There are few times when straight lecture is required. Perhaps when rules
or laws must be imparted word for word, when safety is an issue, or when
your learners have no knowledge of the subject. But for the most part, facili-
tating experiential activities and discussions lead to the same end, enhancing
learning for everyone.
 Create discussion. Not just between you and the learners, but among the
learners.
 Get opinions and ideas out in the open before you deliver your message.
You may be surprised at how much “training” the learners can do for you.
 Share personal experiences to build rapport and trust.
 Provide opportunities for participants to evaluate their own learning
throughout the session.
 Create experiential learning activities in which the learners discover the
learning on their own.
One Last Note: Who’s Who
and What’s What
What is the difference between trainers, teachers, instructors, facilitators, and
others? What distinguishes learners, participants, trainees, and students? How
about the difference between training, educating, and instructing? And last,
what’s the difference between learning, knowledge, skills, and performance?
36
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Who’s who?
First, examine those who are delivering the training:
 Trainers: Title given to adults who are the learning catalysts so other
adults may learn new skills and knowledge. Often, but not always, the
skills and knowledge taught by trainers are required to enhance the
learner’s performance on the job.
 Facilitators: Title given adults who ensure learners’ participation; some-
times interchangeable with trainers but more often used when little
knowledge or skill is dispensed. Often used for describing a person who
conducts team-building or strategic-planning sessions.
 Presenters: Title given adults who deliver speeches at conferences or to
larger groups; minimal emphasis on two-way communication.
 Instructors: Title used for teachers in academia. May also be used for
specific skill sets, such as tennis instructors or flight instructors.
 Teachers: Title most often given those who are instructing children; 
pedagogical. 
How about those who are receiving the training?
 Learners: A neutral term that can be used for anyone gaining information.
 Participants: A general term used by trainers to refer to anyone in a
learning or intervention session; a learner.
 Trainees: Synonymous with participants; most recently has been
replaced by “learners” or “participants.”
 Students: Used for young children; pedagogical.
Avoid using the word “student” when discussing your participants. Learners
or participants best define the adults whom you’re training.
What’s what?
The activity that occurs between the two whos in the preceding section may
be called any of these.
 Training: The activity conducted by adults who are learning new skills.
(Of course this can refer to animals as well!) Knowledge is generally put
to immediate use. Hands-on practice is included.
 Facilitating: May be interchanged with the term “training.” Usually
refers to taking less of a leading role and being more of a catalyst.
37
Chapter 2: Why Adults Learn

I was once given a great bit of advice that I pass on to you. To be the
most successful trainer/facilitator, don’t be a sage on stage, but be a
guide on the side.
 Instructing: Allows participants to generalize beyond what has been
taught. Minimal hands-on practice.
 Educating: Imparting knowledge generally in a broader context with
delayed implementation. Very little hands-on practice.
The results of the activity just discussed may be called some of these: 
 Learning: Gaining knowledge and skills to make change.
 Knowledge: Gaining cognitive competence and information assimilation.
 Skill development: Gaining psychomotor competence.
 Performance: Implementing the knowledge and skills that have been
gained.
You may find other labels for these roles and what occurs, and as the profes-
sion grows and changes you’re likely to find even more. What you call your-
self is not nearly as important as the significant work you accomplish:
Helping adults learn so they can improve their performance. 
Again, why do adults learn? Because everyone wants or needs to learn. We
are all trainers, all learners. Carl Rogers said, “The degree to which I can
create relationships which facilitate the growth of others as separate persons
is a measure of the growth I have achieved in myself.”

Chapter 3
The Training Cycle
In This Chapter
 Introducing The Training Cycle
 Defining training jargon
 Ensuring learning occurs in The Training Cycle
T
he most widely used method for developing new training programs is
called Instructional Systems Design (ISD). ISD was originally developed by
and for the military to effectively create training programs. There are about
100 different ISD models and as many names, but most are based on four to
seven steps represented by the acronym ADDIE: 
 Analysis
 Design
 Development
 Implementation
 Evaluation
These steps are logically sequenced and ensure a practical approach to
designing a training program. Some ISD models are linear; some are circular.
They all accomplish the same thing: design a training program that gets
results. The Training Cycle presented in the next section represents the ISD
model that guides you through the rest of the book.
This chapter is dedicated to understanding The Training Cycle, its back-
ground, its moving parts, and how learning fits into it.
The Training Cycle: An Overview
Anytime you attended a training program, whether it was off-the-shelf or
developed from scratch, whether it was taught by someone inside your orga-
nization or an external vendor, whether it was a program teaching management

40
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 
development skills or word processing skills, chances are that the program
was designed by following a specific process, or a representative ISD model. I
refer to this process as The Training Cycle. The Training Cycle begins long
before the training program is conducted and continues after the program
has been completed. Figure 3-1 is an illustration of the five stages of The
Training Cycle. In this chapter, you get a brief overview of each stage of the
Cycle. Subsequent chapters provide the depth you need to begin to imple-
ment each stage yourself.
It is critical for all trainers to be well rounded and understand the training
process from start to finish. The Training Cycle provides you with a big pic-
ture of the process. You can fill in the details as you move through this book.
Assess and analyze needs
This stage of The Training Cycle is called analysis in the ADDIE acronym.
Generally, you need to conduct an assessment and analyze the data to iden-
tify specific needs. There are two main reasons for completing an assessment
and analysis. 
 First, you want to make sure there is a reason to conduct training. You
may discover, after conducting the analysis, that the relevant issue can
be addressed by something other than training. For example, you may
be able to do on-the-job coaching, or you may feel that an article in the
company newsletter alerts employees to the information needed.

Chapter 3: The Training Cycle
 Second, if you do determine that training is necessary, the analysis
should tell you exactly what should be taught in the training session. It
should also help you determine your training objectives.
There are many ways to conduct assessments. You can use a formal instru-
ment that measures a person’s skill or knowledge or one that simply mea-
sures a person’s preference. You can use written questionnaires or you can
use personal interviews. If you use interviews, you can meet with individuals
one-on-one, or you can conduct small focus groups. Another way to assess a
need is to observe an employee working or to take a work sample. You can
also use records or reports that already exist. 
Your goal in collecting this data is to determine the gap between a job
requirement and an individual’s actual skill or knowledge. Bottom line is to
determine what is preventing the desired performance. You use this informa-
tion in the next stage of The Training Cycle.
Develop learning objectives
After you have determined that there is a legitimate training need, your next
step is to state exactly what you want the training to accomplish. You do this
by writing objectives. There are two kinds of objectives from two perspec-
tives used in training:
 The learning objective: This is a statement of the performance (knowl-
edge or skill) that is desired after the training has been conducted.
Learning objectives should be based on the information you discovered
during the analysis step. For example, “At the end of this training ses-
sion, participants will be able to design participant-focused learning activi-
ties.”
 The training objective: This is a statement of what the instructor hopes
to accomplish during the training session. This may be an outcome, or it
may be a description of what the instructor plans to do in order to
accomplish the learning objectives. For example, “This session will
create a positive learning climate that encourages participants to get
involved and to ask questions.” 
Some trainers include both learning and training objectives in their design.
Learning objectives are a required step in every good training design.
Training objectives help the trainer to focus on designing and delivering a
first-class training program by setting targets for the trainer to achieve.
Learners are told what the learning objectives are at the beginning of a train-
ing session. And preferably at the same time they are told about the training.
But wait, I am getting ahead of myself. I have not yet begun the design process!
That’s what the next stage of The Training Cycle is all about.

Design and develop the program
After you determine the objectives, you can begin the program design. This is
the stage of The Training Cycle that I like best. You decide exactly what you’re
going to do to accomplish the objectives you set. There are many things to
consider in designing a training program. 
Your first decision is whether to design it at all. You may decide instead to
buy it off the shelf and customize it. Whether you design or customize, you
want to consider who your audience is, what the best training techniques
are, how to add creativity to the program, and how to ensure that learning
objectives are met. You also build in methods to ensure that the learning is
applied back on the job and a process to evaluate the program’s effective-
ness.
If you design it, a big task ahead of you is developing the materials. What
paper handouts do the learners need? What audiovisual materials and equip-
ment will you use? If it is an online course, what technical support will you
require? Will your learners require job aids — either paper or online? While
this stage can be exciting, it can also be exhausting. 
Implement the design
This is The Training Cycle stage where you actually conduct the program. A
trainer completes a huge amount of preparation before the program. Even
after an excellent job of preparing, there is no guarantee that the program
will go off without a hitch. That’s why some trainers pilot a program with a
group of pseudo-learners who provide feedback before the session is ready
for prime time. 
You use both presentation and facilitation skills. As a trainer, you’re a presen-
ter and a facilitator:
 Presenters provide more information. If much of the information is
new or technical, you may need to present. The preferred role, however,
is as a facilitator.
 Facilitators play more of a catalyst role and ensure learners’ participa-
tion. A good trainer is often synonymous with the term “facilitator.”
While you’re conducting the training, you want to constantly read your audi-
ence to see whether you’re meeting their needs. If you see that an approach
isn’t working, stop and try another. Don’t be afraid to stray from the agenda if
that seems to be the audience’s need. This is the stage where platform experi-
ence and good facilitation skills are required.
42
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

Evaluate performance
When it’s over, it’s not over. The evaluation stage is an important part of The
Training Cycle for three reasons: 
 First, the evaluation tells you whether or not the objectives were 
accomplished. 
 Second, information from the evaluation stage should be fed into the
assess and analyze stage. It is used to improve the training program
should it be conducted again. This is why this model is circular.
 Finally, evaluation information serves as the basis for determining needs
for future programs or other changes an organization may need to make.
Thus the cycle is complete and the process starts all over again. I examine
each of the five stages in depth starting in Chapter 4.
Training Jargon
Is it soup yet? Alphabet, that is. If you associate with training types, I am sure
you may at times think they are speaking in a foreign tongue. 
Perhaps it is time to introduce a few of the acronyms and technical terms you
hear in the training field. 
 ADDIE: This is a classic model of a training design process. The
acronym is formed by the steps in the process: Analysis, Design,
Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.
 Andragogy: A term developed in Europe to describe the art and science
of adult learning. Malcolm Knowles is sometimes incorrectly credited
with coining the word. He actually introduced and promoted it through
his work and writing. Typically refers to adults’ capacity to direct and
motivate their learning, utilize past experience and knowledge, and eval-
uate the relevance of training content to their personal needs.
 Assessment: Usually refers to a questionnaire, exam, test, or other evalu-
ation process. 
 Asynchronous Training/Learning: Typically a self-paced, online tutorial
that doesn’t require the trainer and instructor to participate at the same
time.
 Audiovisuals: Any medium used to deliver information that enhances
the presentation through auditory and/or visual means, for example,
PowerPoint presentations, video clips, overhead transparencies,
flipcharts. Frequently abbreviated as AV.
43
Chapter 3: The Training Cycle

 Blended learning: The practice of using several mediums in one cur-
riculum. Typically refers to a combination of classroom and self-paced
computer training.
 Bloom’s Taxonomy: A hierarchical ordering of cognitive and affective
learning outcomes developed by Benjamin Bloom and a university com-
mittee. An interesting fact is that the committee actually identified a
third domain of learning, psychomotor, but did not elaborate on it. The
explanation for this oversight was that committee members had little
experience teaching manual skills at the college level. The three learning
outcomes — cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective
(attitude) — are frequently referred to as the KSAs.
 CBT: Computer-based training, a generic term for any learning delivered
via a computer.
 Chunking: Separating learning information into small sections to
improve learner comprehension and retention.
 Criterion-referenced instruction: A system of training developed by
Bob Mager where the results are measured by the learner’s ability to
meet specified performance objectives (criterion) upon completion.
 Delivery method: The way a training is provided to learners, for exam-
ple, classroom, videoconference, CD-ROM, audio tape.
 Design: The formulation of a plan or outline for training.
 Development: The stage of creating a training program in which the
materials are created and training methods are finalized.
 Evaluation: The final step in The Training Cycle used to measure results.
 Hard skills: Refers to technical or information technology (IT) related
skills.
 Icebreaker: An activity conducted at the beginning of a training program
that introduces participants to each other, may introduce content, and
in general helps participants ease into the program.
 ISD: Instructional Systems Design, a process used to analyze, design,
develop, implement, and evaluate training. Hey, isn’t that the ADDIE
model? It is also The Training Cycle, discussed in this chapter.
 Job aid: A tool to provide on-the-job direction for a specific task; may be
in paper or computer format.
 KSA: Knowledge, skills, attitude — the three learning categories based
on Bloom’s Taxonomy.
 Learning objective: A clear, measurable statement of behavior that a
learner demonstrates when the training is considered a success. May
also be called performance objective.
 Learning style: Numerous models abound suggesting individuals’
approaches to learning based on strengths and preferences. 
44
Part I: So You’re Going to Be a Trainer! 

 SME: Subject matter expert, the most knowledgeable person regarding
specific content for a training program.
 Soft skills: Term used to describe a type of training that is not technical
or IT related, for example, communication, leadership, listening, stress
management.
 Task analysis: The process of identifying the specific steps to correctly
perform a task.
Perhaps this short trip through my trainer’s dictionary answers questions
you may have had up to this point and prepares you for the rest of the book.
Learning and The Training Cycle
The Training Cycle is so orderly and straightforward, it seems like it would be
impossible to miss anything important. That’s true, but keep in mind that
training is really about the learner.
Adults learn differently. In Chapter 2, I briefly mentioned several bright minds
that have all arrived at various models for learning preferences. Although
they do not agree on any one measure or model, they do agree that learners
have different preferences for learning. In addition, everyone favors different
senses for recognizing and processing information. If the experts can’t arrive
at a solution for how people learn, how can you be expected to train people
with vastly different learning preferences in the same group? You can!
Variety and flexibility
You can successfully get in touch with all learning styles in your group if you
remember two things:
 Add variety. Lots! Research suggests that varying your delivery methods
and using different training methods enhances learning for everyone. In
fact, most recent research goes even further to say that training that
affects more than one preference actually has a greater impact than focus-
ing on the one preference for each specific learner (as if you could do that,
anyway!). Lots of variety has a greater payoff. Therefore, you should also
vary the delivery itself, changing pace, control, complexity, or timing.
 Be flexible. Just as your learners have a preference for learning, you also
have a preference for training. You may prefer small group activities or
informal discussion or even lectures. You may tend to be more people
focused or content focused. You may prefer to be entertaining or profes-
sorial, coaching or directing. Whatever your preference, be flexible. Move
outside your comfort zone at times to improve learner comprehension
and retention.
45
Chapter 3: The Training Cycle

Conditions of learning
Before leaving this discussion about incorporating learning into The Training
Cycle, I must mention Robert Gagne and his Conditions of Learning. He iden-
tified nine instructional events. Applying these events to your training helps
to ensure learning occurs. Here are Gagne’s Instructional Events:
 Gain the learners’ attention.
 Share the objectives of the session.
 Ask learners to recall prior learning.
 Deliver the content.
 Use methods to enhance understanding, for example, case studies,
examples, graphs.
 Provide an opportunity to practice.
 Provide feedback.
 Assess performance.
 Provide job aids or references to ensure transfer to the job.
If you’ve been around the training field for a while, you know that these
events are commonplace and are assumed to be a part of any effective 
training program.
As a trainer, you’re responsible for doing everything you can to ensure that
learning takes place: Use a theory-based design model like The Training Cycle
presented in this chapter, adapt to learners’ preferences, and incorporate
conditions of learning. Yet remember these words from Galileo Galilei
(1564–1642), an Italian astronomer and physicist: “You cannot teach a man
anything. You can only help him discover it within himself.”

Designing the Best

In this part . . .
You find out that training is all about the learner.
Keeping that in mind, you find answers to questions
about designing training. How do you write an effective
learning objective? How do you design a training session
that is both effective and fun? How do you tap into the
wealth of off-the-shelf materials available to you? And how
can you find time to complete all the preparation that’s
required?

I
f you remember nothing else about training from this book, remember
this: It’s all about the learner.
In this chapter, I begin the design of a training program for the learner. The
design follows the five stages in The Training Cycle presented in the last
chapter. This chapter addresses the first two stages of the cycle: 
 Assess and analyze needs
 Develop learning objectives 
Conducting Needs Assessments
Designing training may be like planning a sightseeing tour in a strange coun-
try. You have lots of things you would like to do, many things you would like
to learn, but you have no idea how far apart any of these things are, what the
people will be like, how long it will take, what attire is appropriate, or which
activities should be higher priority.
When you plan a sightseeing tour, you most likely read a travel guide or two,
contact a travel agency and other experts, talk to people who live there, dis-
cuss the possibilities with others who have taken a similar tour, and check
out the Internet to get the greatest bang for your buck. 
You want answers about why to go, how to go, what to see, when to go, and
with whom you should confer. You collect data about a potential tour. Next,

Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 
you analyze that data and make a decision. You may consider the cost,
required time, and your safety. Your analysis may suggest that the tour you
had hoped for is not a good idea, and you may stop planning. On the other
hand, the data may suggest that you modify your original ideas. In any case,
you have to make a decision about what to do next.
You have just followed the steps of conducting a needs assessment.
1. Identify a need or data to investigate a problem (you need informa-
tion about a tour).
2. Determine a plan for gathering data (decide whom you will contact
and what to read).
3. Gather the data (talk to people, read books).
4. Analyze the data you collected (can you afford it? is the timing
right?).
5. Make a decision (decide to go or not; if yes, use the data to create a
travel plan).
The why, how, what, who, and when
of needs assessment
Like your sightseeing tour, a trainer wants to get the most bang for the buck.
That means conducting a needs assessment and analyzing the data. What’s the
root cause of the problem? Is training even the issue? Figure 4-1 highlights the
first stage of The Training Cycle.

Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives
Why conduct a needs assessment?
Why a needs assessment? The ultimate goal of a needs assessment is to
determine the current and the desired performance. The difference or the
gap between the two is the learning that must occur and the basis for a good
training design. 
Supervisors and managers may approach trainers and request that they con-
duct training because of some incident that has happened. For example, the
cafeteria is getting an unusually high number of customer complaints. Because
of this, the trainer may be asked to develop a customer service skills program.
Although it may be tempting to quickly put together a customer service training
program, it would be much wiser to first determine whether there is really a
need for it. An assessment can help you make such a determination.
Several more specific reasons for conducting a needs assessment include these:
 Determine whether there is a training requirement.
 Determine root causes of a poor performance level.
 Determine desired performance (training results).
 Provide baseline data.
 Identify content and scope of training.
 Gain participant and organizational support. (Often, folks get on board
when they have involvement from the start.)
How to collect data?
There are many tools you may use to conduct a needs assessment. Following
are a few of the most commonly used approaches.
 Interviews: The trainer uses this technique/tool to identify people who
can provide information about the need and then interviews them. The
advantage to this type of interview is that you can obtain in-depth infor-
mation about the situation and you can get others’ ideas about how to
handle the situation. If you do end up providing a training program, you
also have some early commitment because people have had input in
shaping the program. The disadvantage to this type of needs assessment
is that it is labor intensive. By the way, although it isn’t ideal, interviews
may be conducted by telephone as well.
 Focus groups: Another approach is a focus group. Somewhat like the
interview, the trainer identifies key people who can provide information
about the need. However, instead of interviewing them individually, the
trainer interviews them in groups. There are two advantages to this
method. First, the trainer can interview more people in a shorter period
of time. Second, the members of the focus group can piggyback off each
others’ ideas. The disadvantage to this approach is that a quiet person
may not give his/her point of view. The result may be that the trainer
has information provided only by the outspoken members of the group.

 Questionnaires: This tool is used when a trainer wants to collect spe-
cific information from a large group or a widely dispersed group. The
advantages are that you can include many people and the results are
clear cut. The disadvantage is that questionnaires may not allow for free
expression or unanticipated information; therefore, the trainer may miss
some critical data points.
Your data is only as good as the questions you create. You probably
want to test a new questionnaire on a small group of people to deter-
mine what works and what doesn’t. Sometimes, questions can be misin-
terpreted. Sometimes, questions ask for things they never intended.
Sometimes, typos prevent collection of good data also.
 Observation: This is a good needs assessment technique in two circum-
stances. First, it is useful when a trainer is assessing the need for skill-
based training. Second, it is a good technique to use when a trainer is
asked to conduct a program that changes behavior (for example, cus-
tomer service, giving constructive feedback, flipping flapjacks, welding
an I-beam). The most important advantage to this technique is that it
provides the trainer with a realistic view of the situation. The disadvan-
tages are that it takes a long time and it is labor intensive. In addition,
observation can only indicate behavior, not the reasons behind the
behavior or action.
 Performance data reviews: This technique is used when performance
criteria are clear and there is sufficient data available to measure the
performance criteria. The advantage to this approach is that the training
topics and goals are easier to determine. The trainer need only look at
the gap between the criteria and the actual performance. The disadvan-
tage to this approach is that the data may be confounded by other vari-
ables, such as equipment downtime or external expectations.
 Informal discussions: In this approach, the trainer gathers data about
training needs through informal conversations with other employees,
supervisors, and managers in the organization. The advantage of this
approach is that the trainer can get candid information that may help in
choosing a more formal needs assessment approach. The disadvantage
is that it may be biased due to its unsystematic approach.
 Knowledge tests: Tests are beneficial in helping trainers identify what to
include in a knowledge-based program. The advantage to a skill test is
that it measures knowledge versus attitude. A potential disadvantage is
that the items on the skill test may not actually reflect the knowledge
used on the job.
Note that you may use a combination of the tools listed. Every assessment is
different. You don’t use the same assessment you used to plan your foreign
tour to determine how to remodel your bathroom. You may not use the same
needs assessment and analysis tool for two training programs, either.

Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

What criteria will be used to select a data gathering method?
Many factors determine which method you use. The following list provides
an idea of what you, your department, or the organization want to consider.
 Time: What is your turnaround time?
 Cost: How much money is available for the assessment? Hiring someone
from the outside to conduct focus groups can be costly.
 Comfort level and trust: What is the climate within your organization?
Can you rely on the data?
 Size of the population to be surveyed: How many people need to be
involved in the assessment?
 Confidentiality required: Is confidentiality an issue for individuals in
the organization?
 Reliability and validity needed: To what extent is this critical? How will
the assessment methodology affect reliability and validity?
 Culture of the organization: What have employees been used to in the
past, and how may different methods be perceived? What about the cul-
ture? For example, an open organizational structure may encourage
focus groups while an hierarchical organization is more likely to admin-
ister anonymous surveys.
 Location of those to be surveyed: Are a large number of people located
remotely?
Who will be trained?
As important as it is to determine whether there is a training need, it is equally
important to learn as much about your audience as you can. You discover much
about your audience in the data-gathering part of your needs assessment. 
However, in some instances, someone else will have completed the assess-
ment and the analysis. Your job may be to just deliver the program. At those
times, you may find it useful to gain additional information about your partic-
ipants before the training occurs.
Use these questions as a starting point to find out more about your participants.
It is doubtful that you would ever need to know all the information. Consider
it a data smorgasbord. Select those that you want to know more about.
 Background
• Why were you asked to provide training for them?
• Have they had other training on the same topic?
• What do they know (and need to know) about you?
53
Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives

• How many of the participants are personally acquainted with you?
• Are they aware of the level of expertise or experience you bring to
the situation?
• Who are the key players in their department and organization?
 Demographics
• How many will attend your session?
• Is their attendance voluntary? Required? Requested? Invited?
• What is the demographic makeup of the participants? Age?
Gender? Other descriptive factors?
• What information sources do they depend on? Magazines? TV?
Books? Newspapers?
 Level of expertise
• How familiar are they with the subject matter?
• What do they want to know?
• Are all individuals at the same skill and knowledge level with
respect to the topic?
• Who are the experts in the group?
• What is their level of responsibility or authority?
• How does their level compare to yours? Does it determine the sub-
ject level or delivery style?
 Attitudes
• Are they interested in the subject? Should they be interested?
• What successes and issues have they encountered?
• What are their attitudes and beliefs relevant to the topic?
• Do they know why they are coming to training?
• May their minds already be made up?
• What are their opinions about you?
• Will they be friendly? Hostile?
 Design considerations
• Will they ask many questions?
• Do you expect them to raise objections?
• Did the participants and their managers help to identify the objec-
tives of the training?
54
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

• Are you aware of anything that may antagonize them? Hot buttons?
Taboo words or subjects? Gestures? Past experiences?
• What is special about these participants?
• Is there anything special about the location where you will be 
presenting?
• Is there anything unusual about the date or timing of your training,
for example, vacation, recent performance appraisals, downsizing
effort?
 Expected results
• How can you meet their needs?
• How does this training benefit the participants?
• May there be disadvantages to the participants?
• What changes do their supervisors expect as a result of the training?
• Does the organization’s culture encourage participants to use what
they learn in training? What may get in the way of learners’ apply-
ing their new knowledge or skill?
When do you begin the needs assessment?
As quickly as you can!
You want as much time as possible to design and develop the training. It’s a
big job.
No matter how extensive and complete your assessment and analysis are, it
is always a good idea to conduct a mini needs assessment at the beginning of
each session. I like to chart responses to the question, “What are your hopes
and fears for this session?” Other trainers simply ask for each participant’s
expectation. This does two things:
 It helps you determine whether your design is on the mark.
 It gives participants an opportunity to state their expectations.
Besides, it’s a great way for people to start participating early using the sub-
ject as the topic.
Note that you may uncover a few misperceptions. You may also need to make
a few slight modifications to meet all the needs. This is all in a day’s work for
a trainer. Even if participants have expectations that you cannot meet during
this session, you can discuss this with them at the first break to determine
how you may help them.
55
Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives

Potential questions to ask
Each needs assessment is different. Questions you may consider asking
include these:
 What performance gap needs to be addressed?
 Is training the best solution?
 What type of training is required?
 What other solutions have been considered?
 How is the performance impacting the organization?
 What knowledge or skills need to be addressed?
 What are the specific job requirements?
 What instruments, materials, and equipment are used by the employees?
 Who needs this knowledge or skill?
 What is the skill level for these individuals? (may include a list of spe-
cific skills)
 What materials should be included in the training instruction?
 How do these individuals (employees, participants) feel about their 
performance?
 How do these individuals perceive an impending training? What value is
it to them?
 How supportive are the participants’ direct supervisors? Other 
management?
 What resources are available for the training? 
Potentially thousands of questions may be asked. As a trainer, you need to
determine what is most important and what you need to know so that you
can recommend a learning event that is most beneficial to the participants as
well as the organization. Note that I did not say so that you can design and
conduct a training session. One of the most important reasons for conducting
a needs assessment and analyzing the data is to determine whether training
is the answer.
Is it training?
It isn’t over until you know whether it is a training need. These three quick
questions help you pinpoint the answer:
56
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Does the individual have the skill to do the job?
 Does the individual have the will to do the job?
 Is the individual allowed to do the job?
If the answer to the first question is “no,” training may be a solution but not
necessarily. If the answer to all of the questions is “yes,” it is definitely not a
training solution.
Well, what else could it be? 
 A “no” to the second question means you may have a motivation prob-
lem; training doesn’t solve that.
 A “no” to the third question means there is probably a procedure or
policy problem; training doesn’t solve that.
 A “yes” to all three questions could mean that it is an equipment prob-
lem that prevents individuals from producing quality on time.
 Even a “no” to the first question doesn’t necessarily mean training is
required; perhaps coaching is a solution. In other instances, individuals
may not have received feedback and may not even know they are doing
something incorrectly.
Before anyone jumps to the assumption that a performance problem requires
training, consider that it may be due to dozens of other things: inadequate
materials, tools, or workspace; unreliable equipment; unclear expectations;
inappropriate consequences or incentives; lack of feedback or coaching;
inappropriate job assignment; work environment; or others.
Before you finalize your needs assessment, be certain to know whether train-
ing is the solution. Don’t make the mistake of presupposing that training is the
solution to a performance issue prior to completing your needs assessment.
If your time is limited
You may wish to believe that The Training Cycle is always followed and that a
thorough needs assessment is always completed. That just isn’t the real world.
If you’ve been in the training field during the past few years you know that
timelines are shorter, demand is more frequent, and expectations are higher.
Although training should start with the business goal, it doesn’t always. 
So what can you do? You could skip the needs assessment stage completely,
but later, you may wish that you hadn’t. I’ve done all of the following at one
57
Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives

time or another. While they are not the same as a complete needs assess-
ment, one or two can provide you with some basic information so that you
can better understand the situation.
 Get as much information from the contact person as possible. This at
least gives you a foundation.
 Talk to several participants. If I need information fast, I ask the contact
person to line up a couple of phone interviews for me. I ask each person
several of the questions discussed in the “The why, how, what, who, and
when of needs assessment” section in this chapter. 
 E-mail a simple questionnaire to all the participants. You get a better
response if you attach it to a friendly note from you that welcomes the
participants to the training, informs them of the objectives, and lets
them know what they may expect, for example, practical, hands-on; ten
ways to express your creativity; action-packed day filled with tips you
can implement immediately.
 Ask your contact to provide any materials that may be relevant for the
session, for example, meeting agendas and notes, survey results.
 If you know others in the organization, you may wish to contact them for
any “inside scoop.”
 Contact other trainers or colleagues who may have worked with this
group in the past. Do this especially if you’re filling in for someone.
 If you really have no time, you probably want to add opening activities
that help you gain information about the group. You may ask about their
expectations, their hopes and fears for the session, their greatest prob-
lem and greatest success as it relates to the content, or any other activ-
ity that helps to fill the needs assessment gap.
 I may also pack a few backup materials and activities in case the session
takes a turn for something different from what I had planned.
Do what you can. An hour or two on the telephone with knowledgeable people
makes a huge difference. At least you have some data. Walking in with even a
small amount of data in your hip pocket is always better than walking into a
big void.
Check with your local college or university. Frequently marketing classes are
looking for assessment or survey design projects. You need to allow time for
both the design as well as educating the group or individual about you and
your organization. If you have time but a minimum amount of money, this can
be an elegant solution.
58
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Writing Objectives
After you complete the needs assessment, analyze the data, and ascertain the
need for training, you develop the objectives for the training. Figure 4-2 shows
that developing objectives is the second stage of The Training Cycle.
Learning objectives are written for the learner. You may also choose to write
training objectives which are for the design and development of the training.
Learning objectives are a requirement. Many trainers do not write training
objectives.
What objectives should do
Learning objectives are written to specify the performance (knowledge or skill)
that is desired after the training has been completed. The following sections
spell out the four elements you want to include in your learning objectives.
Specifying exactly what the learner will be able to do
In Chapter 2, you can read about Bloom’s Taxonomy, the hierarchy of learning
outcomes. This is the point in The Training Cycle where Bloom’s Taxonomy
comes in handy: specifying exactly what the learner will know or be able to do
at the end of the training experience.

Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives

Do you want the learners to have knowledge about the subject? Comprehen-
sion? Be able to apply the information? Analyze or synthesize it? Or do you
want them to be able to make judgments about the information? 
Because the goal of most training that you conduct is to improve skills, you
most often select verbs from the application column. However, there are
other objectives to training programs that may not require application, but
merely comprehension. And, of course, there are also times when you want
the learner to go beyond application.
The list of verbs associated with the six levels in Table 4-1 helps you to select
a verb that fits the level of learning.

Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Deciding whether you’ve written a good objective
An objective should meet several criteria. It should be specific so that there
is no question about what you mean. It should be measurable, meaning you
should be able to count it or determine with a distinct yes or no whether it
was accomplished. An objective should be attainable — no pie in the sky
statement, yet it should not be so easy to attain that it isn’t worth the paper
on which it is written. An objective should be relevant to the mission of the
organization, to the change that is desired, to achieve the greater goal. And
finally, it should be time bound, meaning: When is the individual expected to
achieve the objective: by the end of the training session, within a month?
Objectives should be SMART, as follows:
 Specific
 Measurable
 Attainable, yet a stretch
 Relevant
 Time-bound
Getting additional guidance 
Use these additional ideas for writing objectives:
 Be brief and to the point; include only one major item in each objective.
 Use an observable action verb to describe the expected result. You can
see (or hear) “list,” “demonstrate,” and “calculate.” You cannot see
someone “remember,” “believe,” or “learn.”
 Specify a time frame or target date of completion; generally, this occurs
at the end of the training session.
 Specify resource limitations (money, personnel, equipment) as 
appropriate.
 Describe the participants’ expected performance.
 Specify results to be achieved in measurable or observable terms.
 Choose areas over which you have direct influence or control; don’t
write objectives for which your training program has no accountability. 
 Make objectives realistic in terms of what can actually be accomplished
in the training as well as in terms of resources you have available to you.
 Include enough challenge in the objective to make it worth formulating.
 Indicate the minimum level of acceptable performance.
 Specify the conditions (if any) under which the action must be performed.
61
Chapter 4: Assessing Needs and Developing Learning Objectives

 Specify degree of success if less than 100 percent is acceptable.
 Select objectives that are supportive and consistent with overall organi-
zation missions and goals.
Using this formula to easily write objectives
A correctly written objective includes four components, sometimes called
the ABCDs of a good objective:
 Audience (who)
 Behavior (will do what)
 Condition (by when or some other condition, such as with assistance)
 Degree (how well, if not 100 percent of the time)
To easily write an objective, fill in the blanks. Use this formula to help you out. 
Who will do what, by when, and how well?
_______ will _______, by _______, ________.
“You will be able to write good learning objectives, by the time you finish this
chapter, 100 percent of the time.”
Is it a SMART objective?
 Specific? Yes, I can see you “write objectives.”
 Measurable? Yes, 100 percent.
 Attainable, yet a stretch? Yes, not that much of a stretch for you.
 Relevant? Yes, that’s what this chapter is about.
 Time-bound? Yes, depending on how fast you read.
Trainers design the training based on the learning objectives. Typically, train-
ers also post the objectives at the beginning of their sessions. They may
word the objective less clinically and begin it with, “By the end of this train-
ing. . . .” If the learners are expected to be able to do the task 100 percent of
the time, the trainers may not include it in the objective. Therefore, the
objective may be rewritten.
“By the end of this training, you will be able to write learning objectives.”
Task analysis
At some point in your career you’re likely to find folks who are involved in
task analysis. In its simplest form, task analysis breaks a job (task) down into
62
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

observable steps. It also reveals the knowledge and skills the employee needs
to complete each step. At times task analysis is used to determine training
needs. It may be a part of the analysis completed during the needs assess-
ment. Learning objectives may be written based on the task analysis. 
I understand, for example, that the task of tying a shoe can be broken down
into 214 steps! Task analysis steps are completed to determine which aspects
of the job to include in a training program.
1. Identify tasks that are required for performing the job.
2. For each task, list the exact steps that a person must do to complete
the task. List every step from start to finish in order, no matter how
small the step.
3. When listing the steps, make them as clear as possible. Even the small-
est assumption can create confusion in the actual performance of the
task.
4. After you have completed all steps for every task, go back and iden-
tify each step in one of three ways:
• Common knowledge: Trainee will know how to do this step because
of common knowledge. No training is necessary for this step.
• On-the-job training: The step is simple enough that the trainee can
learn it on the job. No training is necessary for this step, but you
may want to consider developing a job aid such as a check sheet
or a list of procedures.
• Training topic: The trainee will not know how to do this step with-
out training. Your technical training program should be based
around these topics.
5. Ask a subject matter expert (SME) to review your task analysis to see
whether you have analyzed the job(s) correctly.
6. Design your training program around those topics you identified as
requiring training.
7. If you also develop job aids, make sure they are integrated into the
training program so that trainees know they are available and so that
they can ask questions, if they have them.
Task analysis and training objectives are used prior to designing the training
program. Both are critical steps between conducting the needs assessment
and designing the training program. Both play a part in setting the goals of
the training session and ultimately achieving them. As David Campbell says,
“Aim at nothing and you’ll hit it every time.”

raining is serious business. Or is it?
Educators know that children learn from play. Adults do, too. This chapter
addresses the design and development of training. While the design and
development of a training program is a lot of work, you should remember
throughout to ensure that the design creates training that is learner-focused.
That is, the participant learns all the KSAs (knowledge, skills, attitudes —
remember?) while enjoying the process along the way.
This chapter discusses the third stage of The Training Cycle, design and
development (see Figure 5-1). The training you design and develop is built
on a foundation formed by two important aspects: adult learning principles
and the learning objectives.
 The adult learning principles, developed by Malcolm Knowles and dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, are the basic characteristics that distinguish adult
learning from how children learn.
 The learning objectives, created as a result of the needs assessment and
analysis discussed in Chapter 4, describe what the participant knows or
does as a result of the training.

You may discover that some training designers create a distinct split between
the “design” and the “development” of a training program. The distinctions
for these folks focus on a couple of things.
 Design focuses on preparing the designer for selecting and writing the
materials. Actions include writing objectives, deciding on the sequence
of content, identifying documentation, and planning the evaluation.
 Development focuses on selecting and creating the materials. Actions
include selecting and writing materials for the participants’ and the
trainer’s use, documentation, and the evaluation of materials.
Do you see the similarities and the small difference? Other than writing the
objectives, the design stage provides direction for what to do in the develop-
ment stage. At any rate, this model combines the two. 
In this chapter, I divide the design of training into three segments: what you
need to accomplish at the beginning of the training, what you need to accom-
plish in the middle of the training, and what you need to accomplish at the
end of the training. Beginning, middle, end. That’s logical.
 Beginning: An opening that establishes a climate conducive to learning.
 Middle: A body that ensures learning occurs.
 End: A conclusion that provides a sense of closure to the training and an
anticipation for applying what was learned after the training experience.

Are you ready to begin the design and development process? Remember to
have some fun along the way.
Designing Learning is one of the Areas of Expertise as identified by the
Competency Study from the American Society for Training and Development
(ASTD) 2004. It is one of the areas that trainers may have as an emphasis in 
certification.
How Do I Begin?
Your training design starts with the end first: the expected improved perfor-
mance of each participant. The learning objectives act as your guide to the
design. List the learning objectives in the order in which you will teach them.
You want to break some of the objectives down to the more specific skills and
knowledge participants will acquire to improve their performance. Can you
see an outline taking shape? That’s exactly what you need to begin the design
process! Consider the following abbreviated outline of the topics used for a
train-the-trainer session.

How do you turn an outline into a training session? Entire books are written
on the subject of designing a training program. Some designers want you to
use a specific model, identify confirming and corrective feedback, identify the
rationale, create task listings, list the resources (a.k.a. markers), determine a
task criticality rating, develop a process map, identify evaluation criteria,
identify units, create an information map, compare to an organizational
scheme, and on and on. I don’t know about you, but I can’t keep that many
concepts in my head all at once.
What I can do is organize the content in a logical flow and figure out the best
way to assist the participants to acquire the skill or knowledge required to
achieve the desired performance. And that’s what you need to focus on for
now. If you want to go into more depth, I suggest you contact your local chap-
ter of ASTD for a design course recommendation.
Oh, and one more thing. Before you continue too far with the design process,
you need to find out how the training will be delivered. Someone else will
most likely make that decision. The choices include trainer-led classroom,
trainer-led from a remote location, on-the-job training (OJT), self-paced, or
technology-based training. Instructor-led classroom continues to be the most
implemented at about 70 percent. Both instructor-led from a remote location
(for example, Webconferencing, videoconferencing) and technology-based
(with no instructor) are growing slightly each year. Blended learning, a con-
temporary term, is a combination of two or more delivery systems.
The rest of this book focuses on the trainer-led classroom delivery. However,
most of the information and techniques are also directly transferable to the
trainer-led from a remote location.

You have been asked to develop a training program that will occur in a class-
room setting. What’s next? These are the steps I use to design and develop a
learning experience. I think you will find them easy to follow.
Before you dive in to design and develop the training program, obtain a clear
definition of the limitations. Many a trainer has been headed in a direction
only to learn that resources are not available in the form of time, money, or
people. Clarify the limitations first.
1. List all the learning objectives for the session. This is the basis for the
content.
2. If you need to break the objectives down to smaller, more manageable
units, do so now.
3. Arrange the learning objectives into a logical learning sequence. The
sequences that are most often used include these:
• Chronological 
• Procedural order
• Problem/solution
• Categories
• General to specific
• Simple to complex
• Less risky to more risky
• Known to unknown 
4. Determine content, ensuring that you have enough, but not too much.
What do your learners need to know? Need to do? What specific
knowledge and skills will help them achieve the learning objectives?
5. Identify the best methodology, for example, role play, discussion, or
practice, to use to transmit the content to the learner.
6. Develop or purchase the support material you need to go along with
what will happen during the learning experience. This includes some
or all of these.
• Participant materials, for example, manual, handouts, job aids, texts
• Visual and media support, for example, overhead transparencies,
PowerPoint presentation, videos, software
• Activity support, for example, role-play cards, scripts, exercises,
props, case studies
• Trainer materials, for example, trainer’s guide, markers
69
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

• Administrative support, for example, agenda, roster, supply check-
list, evaluations
7. Conduct a pilot to determine what needs to be changed or improved
to achieve success.
If you need to play with the sequence of the learning objectives, you can do
it on your computer. Another possibility is to write each objective on a sepa-
rate index card. Lay the cards on a table and move them around until you
achieve what you’re looking for.
The rest of this chapter is devoted to how you fill in the gaps of the design
outline you have created. It is divided into the three different parts of the ses-
sion: the beginning, middle, and the end. (How’s that for a logical sequence?)
This chapter also discusses some of the methodologies you may use: lec-
turettes and over 50 types of activities. It provides you with tips for designing
media and visual materials.
Designing a Dynamic Opening
The first ten minutes of your training design may be the most important ten
minutes of the entire session.
A successful opening should accomplish several things.
 Establish a participative climate
 Introduce participants
 Introduce the agenda
 Clarify the participants’ expectations
 List objectives of the training
 Build interest and excitement
 Learn something about the participants
 Determine some minimum rules of engagement and ground rules
 Establish your credibility
All about icebreakers
Have you ever attended a training session when someone droned on for the
first 15 minutes about the procedure for completing the sign-in sheet, where
70
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

the bathrooms are located, how to get to the cafeteria, how to get your park-
ing pass stamped, and on and on? Really got you excited about the training
session, I’ll bet! 
My hero of icebreakers is Edie West, author, training consultant, and long-
time expert on the creation of icebreakers and energizers.
I like to start my sessions with something that surprises or shocks the par-
ticipants. For example, after being introduced, I have started by walking in
with a large shopping bag full of T-shirts and saying, “They say you can’t tell
a book by its cover. But I believe you can tell a person by her T-shirt!” I pro-
ceed to pull T-shirts out of the bag and read the funny sayings to the group.
I hand them a bright sheet of paper (several different colors are used) with
the outline of a T-shirt and ask them to use the crayons on the table to draw
a picture or write a slogan on the T-shirt that represents their motto or what
they stand for.
When participants have all finished designing their T-shirts — and it may
take some prodding — I ask them to get up and find all the other participants
whose paper is the same color as theirs, to introduce themselves to each
other, and to explain their T-shirts (about 5 minutes). I ask them to sit down
and have each person introduce themselves and their T-shirts to the rest of
the group. At the end I have them all hang their T-shirts on the wall.

Icebreakers, a delicacy
by Edie West
Successful icebreakers are the proverbial frost-
ing on the cake. They enhance the delicate
flavor of a training program and help preserve
its freshness. Don’t worry if everyone’s taste is
different — a well-designed, well-executed ice-
breaker achieves its purpose anyway. What
would a birthday party be without a cake?
Just as a German chocolate cake needs a
coconut frosting, the success in using ice-
breakers is in choosing ones with the right
ingredients to help set the venue and tone:
 Choose or create an icebreaker that has a
real purpose tied to the program outcomes.
 Select icebreaker types that are relevant
to participants, the program, and the 
facilitator.
 Conduct with lighthearted instructions that
raise levels of comfort and acceptance.
 Use appropriate humor to enhance the
experience.
 Assist participants to draw conclusions that
underscore the intent.
Happy baking!

You discover in the “Selecting activities” section in this chapter how I use the
T-shirt theme throughout the session. But for now, what have I done?
 Grabbed their attention
 Established a participative climate, instant involvement
 Set the pace — fast
 Put people at ease (including the trainer)
 Initiated personal interaction and individual introductions
 Heard everyone’s names
 Had everyone speak once in the large group
 Started to define the group’s personality (trainer observation)
 Started to identify the individual personalities 
 Everyone learned something about each other (shortens the path to find
other participants with similar interests)
 Established a transition to the content
72
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 
Design content-related icebreakers
Icebreakers should have something to do with
the content. These four ideas show you just
how easy it can be. 
 When participants introduce themselves,
ask them to state their names, which
department (or company) they are from, and
to add one piece of information that relates
to the session content. For example, if
you’re training problem-solving skills, ask
them to identify one example of how they
hope to use the skills they are about to
learn.
 Ask participants to get into small groups
(three to four people) around the table, to
introduce themselves to each other, and as
a group to decide on the biggest challenge
they have that relates to the session con-
tent. For example, if you’re teaching listen-
ing skills to front desk hotel personnel, you
may ask them to decide the biggest chal-
lenge they face where listening skills may
be useful.
 In any training session, you can ask partic-
ipants to identify their expectations for the
class.
 You can always bring in a box of “things”
(dollar stores are great places to find
“things”) and have them select one “thing”
and relate it to the content. For example, if
you’re training team-building skills, you can
provide a box of tools (tape measure,
hammer, ice scraper, measuring cup, pan-
cake turner, wire whip, level, scissors, sta-
pler, calculator). Pass the box around and
ask each person to select a tool. When par-
ticipants introduce themselves, they are to
complete the statement, “As a team player
I am like a ________ because. . . ,” filling in
the blank with the tool they selected.

What!?! The content? Yes. I use this icebreaker for the train-the-trainer course
that I teach, and after the final introduction, the class begins to process the
icebreaker itself. And this is where I slip in a few references about my credibil-
ity: “As a trainer for the last 20 years, I. . .” or “As the training director for. . .”
or “As I discuss in my last book. . . .”
As I write this I am staring at a quote written by someone who published an
article in a training journal: “Icebreakers have nothing to do with course con-
tent, but they’re essential if you want people to work together.” Right on the
last part, but absolutely wrong on the first part. With a little planning, you
should be able to design an icebreaker that introduces the content. See the
“Design content-related icebreakers” sidebar for further information.
If a group is composed of people who know each other well, an icebreaker
may not be necessary for getting acquainted; there are other opening activi-
ties you may need to conduct. The first ten minutes is a very important time
for your session. A well-designed opening and icebreaker establish a climate
that is conducive to learning.
What else will your participants 
expect in your design?
Your participants will expect you to design several orientation tasks to get
the session started. If I am facilitating a session that lasts at least one full day,
I generally allow a little more than an hour for the opening activities. I find
that investing time up front prevents other problems from happening later
on. Okay, so how do I plan for that time?
 Icebreaker: 15 minutes
 Introductions: 20 minutes (1 minute per person)
 Review agenda: 2 minutes
 Mini needs assessment: 3 minutes
 Introduce learning objectives: 10 minutes
 Clarify their expectations: 10 minutes
 Establish ground rules: 7 minutes
 Housekeeping information: 1 minute
Remember these are estimates. Sometimes, the icebreaker takes longer or
participants get wordy with their introductions. Build some slippage in the
rest of the morning. Believe me, this opening time is worth it.
73
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

If you examine this list of opening activities, what must be developed?
 You need to design the icebreaker, and if you need a handout (see infor-
mation about Bingo in Chapter 23), you need to develop it.
 You most likely want table tents (cardstock folded in half lengthwise) on
which participants write their names; the markers should have a broad-
enough tip so that participants’ names can be seen from all places
around the room.
 You want an agenda printed on paper so that each participant can
have one. 
I do not put specific times on the agenda. Participants get nervous if they see
that you’re behind by 30 minutes. They don’t understand that you may be
currently covering something that was planned for later or that you know
that what they are addressing now is much more important than something
later and that you can decrease time on another activity.
I print my personal agenda on brightly colored paper with time required for
each activity. I use bright paper so that I can see it if it gets lost under hand-
outs or whatever. And I need to have those times so that I keep the class on
track. I like to allow flexibility to meet participants’ needs, but I also need to
take full responsibility for achieving the learning objectives.
 You need to know what information you need for the mini needs assess-
ment. In the case of the train-the-trainer, I wanted to know how long they
had been trainers, whether they had ever attended a train-the-trainer,
whether they had designed training, and finally whether they thought
that training was their destined profession.
 You may want to post the learning objectives on a flipchart pad so that
you can hang them on the wall after you discuss them, keeping them 
visible.
 You need blank flipchart pages to note participants’ expectations and
the ground rules. I do not dictate ground rules. The groups establish
their own. I find that they follow them better that way.
That wraps up the design for the opening.
Designing the Body to Ensure
Learning Occurs
Perhaps you have designed an opening for the training session that meets the
requirements to establish a climate that is conducive to learning. Now get
started on the middle, which is the bulk of the training. It requires that you
74
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

design factors into the training that ensure that learning occurs. The purpose
of the body is to ensure that your participants
 Accomplish the stated objectives.
 Learn all the concepts presented.
 Practice the skills.
 Acquire feedback.
 Understand the application to the job (or beyond the training experience).
Lectures
You know how important it is for learners to be actively involved in the train-
ing. Yet there may be times when you need to deliver a larger amount of infor-
mation. A lecture may be unavoidable. In that case, you need to present the
information. Even so, I never use the word “lecture.” I use a made-up word,
lecturette, for these special times. It gives the illusion of being less tedious
and a bit more playful! And that’s exactly what I am recommending you do
with your lecturettes. Make them playful and learner-centered.
Problems with a lecture
“So what’s so bad about lectures?” you may ask. You’ve probably heard hun-
dreds of lectures in school, and you survived that. It’s not that they are bad,
but there are better ways. First, consider some of the problems.
‘
 It doesn’t involve the participants.
 It ignores participants’ experience.
 It rarely stimulates excitement and involvement.
 The trainer, due to minimal feedback, has no way of knowing whether
participants are understanding the concepts. 
 It is one-way communication, often resulting in passive learners who do
not have an opportunity to clarify material.
 People may leave with incorrect information.
 It may be physically uncomfortable.
 It can be dull and boring.
 It is impossible to hold individuals’ attention for long periods of time.
 Success is dependent on speaking ability.
 It doesn’t account for various learning styles.
75
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

 It creates a poor transfer of learning.
 It is difficult to reinforce an audience.
Can you think of other problems with lecturing?
Some appropriate times for a lecture
On the other hand, there may be times when it is best for you to lecture.
Perhaps you have been in situations like these:
 A short lecture followed by another activity can be appropriate for intro-
ducing key conceptual ideas.
 When used in conjunction with a variety of activities, a lecture can be a
refreshing way for participants to relax while they learn.
 If you need to disseminate a large amount of information in a short
period of time, a lecture may be appropriate. However, it should be
accompanied by a job aid or some other materials for future reference.
 A lecture may be appropriate if you need to maintain control of the
group and reduce verbal resistance.
 A lecture is appropriate when specific information must be disseminated
that affects ethics, legal aspects, safety, and so on.
 A well-prepared, humorous lecture may stimulate a group.
 A lecture may be an easier technique for some trainers.
 Guest speakers, who are known for their expertise in a given content
area, may be admired for their lecture. This can backfire, however, if the
speaker loses the group.
 You may use a lecture when a group is so large that participative meth-
ods would be chaotic.
Are there other times when lecture may be appropriate?
If you must use a lecturette, make it participative
How in the world can you design a participative lecturette? Try these sugges-
tions. Most are practical and easy to build in to any lecturette.
 Design pop quizzes in the middle.
 Plan to ask questions regarding predictions or recall of information.
 Create a conversation between trainer and participants.
 Intersperse tasks or demonstrations.
 Develop a guided note-taking page in the form of questions or fill in the
blanks.
76
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Develop handouts with a key-word outline of the presentation with room
to write.
 Design visuals to go with the lecturette so that participants can follow
your words visually.
 Plan to stop at various points to ask whether everyone is with you.
 Present a partial story at the beginning and complete the story after the
end of the lecturette.
 Find ways to interject humor, such as creating a cartoon to match the
content you present.
Lecture if you must, but build participation into your lecturettes.
Countless alternatives to lecture
There are hundreds of alternative methods you can use to replace a lecture.
Recognize that many of these methods usually take longer than a lecturette,
but a well-constructed activity enhances learning because the participant
experiences the learning by being personally involved. For example, in the
classic NASA “Lost on the Moon” exercise, participants experience the power
and value of group decision-making.
Why would you use an activity anyway? 
 Activities are energizing. Use games in your design to give people a
break, time to stretch (their brains, as well as their bodies), to relieve
stress, and to just get energized. 
 Activities get people working together. Build rapport among partici-
pants to increase the amount of knowledge floating around the room.
More learning occurs when everyone is sharing and learning from each
other. As the trainer/facilitator, you have a body of knowledge, but the
compiled knowledge of your group far outweighs what you know. 
 Activities promote learning by doing. Your participants retain the
knowledge better if you can engage as many of their senses as possible.
 Activities provide you with a way to reinforce information. It would be
pretty boring if you stated the same things over and over in the same
way, even though you know that repetition is good. Activities allow par-
ticipants to experience the same information in another way.
 Activities are motivational. Learners respond because they are actively
involved. It is a pleasant way to learn.
Thousands of activities, games, and exercises exist. Or you can create your
own. One of the best resources for games is The Games Trainers Play series by
77
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Ed Scannell and John Newstrom. The best resource for experiential learning
activities is The Pfeiffer Annual. Two volumes are published each year, one for
trainers and one for consultants. These resources and many others publish
activities that you can easily adapt to the training program you’re designing.
Presentation variations
Presentations refer to any method that gives information to the participants
with less interaction than many of the other methods.
 Panel: Made up of participants, managers, customers, or top executives,
providing a unique opportunity for an intimate discussion or a question-
and-answer period.
 Tour: Visit someplace in the organization where a host guides you
through the information you need to know, for example, the organiza-
tion’s library, to demonstrate how to retrieve information.
 Lecturette: A mini lecture because I believe all lectures should be inter-
active and so brief that it’s over before anyone notices.
 Guided note-taking: Create handouts that have spaces available to add
information. Information is gleaned during a lecturette, while watching a
role play, or while viewing a video.
 Storytelling: Telling an event (true or fictitious) that has a moral or
lesson or demonstrates consequences. The punch line leaves the lis-
tener inspired, influenced, or improved, without necessarily explaining
the learning point.
 Debate: Two teams address two different sides of an issue to explore
perspectives from both sides.
Experiential learning activities
Experiential learning activities (ELAs), sometimes called structured experi-
ences, are in a category of their own. ELAs are activities that are specifically
designed for inductive learning through the five-stage cycle associated with
them: experiencing, publishing, processing, generalizing, and applying. More
information can be found in Chapter 8. ELAs are especially useful in a change-
management situation or when attitudes are an issue. 
Demonstrations
Demonstrations typically involve someone showing the participants a
process or modeling a procedure.
 Instructor role play: Role play by two instructors to demonstrate a
technique or make a point, followed with discussion.
 Field trips: Visit the location where the action takes place. If you’re
teaching customer service, visit your call center and listen in on a few
live calls to discuss technique.
78
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Video, DVD: Use clips from training or commercial videos for partici-
pants to identify issues, solve problems, and rewrite the scripts. Be sure
to follow copyright laws.
 Magic tricks: Use magic tricks to help you make an analogous point
within the training. 
 Coaching: Sometimes conducted outside a training event, it could be
used as participants practice a particularly difficult skill. Participants
are in pairs during role plays or other skill practice.
 Interviews: Participants ask questions of a resource person who attends
the training session at a designated time. Purpose is to obtain another
perspective, hear from the expert, or add knowledge.
 Props: Oh my gosh! So many possibilities! Bring tools: “As a team player
I am most like a _____.” Bring chunks of two by fours for participants to
write the skills they have acquired and “build” the final structure. Bring
packets of seeds and use as a metaphor for the “seeds of communica-
tion.” Well, you get the idea. 
Reading 
Reading refers to any method that pertains to interacting with the printed
word.
 Read ahead: Materials provided to participants to read prior to the 
session.
 Letters to each other: Participants write letters to each other to provide
feedback, as a summary of what each has learned in the session, or as
follow-up after the training.
 Story starters: Participants are given a partial situation and then complete
it practicing the skills and knowledge they are learning in the training.
Drama
Drama refers to methods that require the participants or the facilitator to act
out a role.
 Skits: A short presentation presented by small groups to demonstrate
skill or knowledge learned.
 Survival problem solving: Usually used as a team-building activity in
which a team is placed in a situation that represents danger. Team mem-
bers need to work together using specified criteria to make decisions.
 Costumes: Can be used by the trainer to make a point or play a role.
Partial costumes, hats for example, could be analogies for the different
roles people play on the job.
 Writing a script: Participants can script a role play for other participants
based on the content.
79
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Discussions 
Discussion methods refer to two-way discussions that occur between partici-
pants and/or the facilitator.
 Buzz groups: Two people “buzz” for one to two minutes about a topic
before sharing their ideas with the larger group.
 Round robin: Trainer gets opinions from everyone in the training ses-
sion. Discussion or rebuttal is held until everyone’s ideas have been
stated.
 Brainstorming: A process for identifying a large number of ideas without
judgment.
 Nominal group technique: A problem-solving tool where ideas are ini-
tially generated in silence, then weighted, and prioritized.
 Fishbowl: Group is divided with half the participants sitting in a circle
(the fishbowl) discussing a topic. The other half of the group is sitting
around the outside and can coach during the discussion, can silently
motion to replace someone, or can offer feedback at the end. Several
variations.
 Develop a theory: Participants make up a theory related to the knowl-
edge or skills they are learning.
Cases
Cases generally refer to learning methods in which the participants are pre-
sented with scenarios that require analysis and suggestions for improvement.
 Case studies: A real or fictional situation is presented to the participants
to analyze and recommend solutions. If an actual situation was presented,
the facilitator usually shares the actual outcome.
 In-baskets: Items are given to participants that replicate problems, mes-
sages, and tasks that could actually show up in someone’s in-basket.
Participants must make decisions, manage their time, and establish pri-
orities as they address the items. 
 Critical incidents: A short version of a case study, which focuses on the
most vital aspects of a problem situation, and so on.
 Sequential case studies: Participants are given a portion of a case study.
Depending on the decision they make on the first portion, a second,
third and perhaps even a fourth set of data is distributed. All groups
may end up in different places.
 Problem-solving clinic: Participants bring real-world problems for the
rest of the group to solve.
80
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Art
Art entails more creative methods involving drawing, design, sculpting, or
other nonword events.
 Portraits: Participants create portraits of themselves being successful at
learning the content of the session or as an opening activity to introduce
themselves to the group.
 Cartoons: Can be used as energizers or to reinforce knowledge or skills
that are being taught.
 Posters: Participants create posters to make a point, summarize infor-
mation, and so on.
 Draw how you feel about _____: Exactly what it says, draw how you feel
about whatever the topic is. Can be reworded such as draw a logo that
represents teamwork.
Playlikes 
Playlikes are learning methods that are similar to dramatizations but less
serious and more open ended. 
 Role plays: Participants act out roles, attitudes, or behaviors that are
not their own to practice skills or apply what they have learned.
Frequently an observer provides feedback to those in character.
 Role reversals: Participants assume the role of the person with whom
they interact daily, for example, their bosses.
 Video feedback: Participants are videotaped during a role play or presen-
tation situation. They view their own tapes and complete a self-critique.
 Outdoor adventure learning: Sometimes called ropes courses; used for
problem solving and team building.
 Improv: Actors create a skit without a script. Input and ideas are
gleaned from the audience. 
 Simulations: A training environment that closely represents the real
environment to allow participants to practice skills.
Games
Games refer to any board, card, television, computer, or physical event that
leads to learning or review of material.
 Crossword puzzles: Computer software can take a list of terms from the
session and arrange clues and words into a crossword puzzle.
 Relays: Teams set up in a relay to compete to be the first to complete a
set of instructions. Good for review of concepts to test skill acquisition.
81
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

 Card games: As many variations as there are cards! Various pieces of
data can be placed on cards to solve a problem.
 Computer games: Good for reinforcing skills back at the workplace after
the session.
 Any board-game adaptation: Many board games such as Trivial Pursuit
can be adapted to the content of the training.
 Any game-show adaptation: Game shows such as Jeopardy! can be
adapted to the content of the training.
Participant directed
The method refers to situations where participants take the leadership role
in the delivery of training to others or the analysis of their own learning.
 Skill centers: Several areas are set up around the training room to prac-
tice skills or test knowledge. Trainees move from one area to another,
selecting the ones most appropriate for them.
 Teaching teams: Usually pairs select a topic from the agenda and teach
the rest of the group.
 Self-analysis: Usually a series of questions with correct answers to
review knowledge. May also be a set of thought-provoking concepts or
questions that allow participants to examine their personal attitudes.
 Teach backs: Participants are given a small portion of content that they
study and “teach back” to the rest of the participants. This can be con-
ducted in small groups or the larger group.
 Journaling: Participants keep a written record of thoughts, feelings,
reactions, successes, plans, and action items.
 Research: Challenge given in the classroom for participants to track
down the correct answer between sessions. Can be used to locate infor-
mation on the internet as well.
Participant events
Participant events refers to learning methods that have a specific placement
in a training session.
 Icebreakers: A structured activity usually used at the beginning of a
training session to initiate participation and introductions.
 Energizers: A brief activity, exercise, or brain teaser offered to “ener-
gize” the group.
 Closers: Group activity used at the end to bring closure to the session,
make commitments, review key points, plan application actions, and cel-
ebrate success.
82
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Selecting activities
Okay, you’re exhausted just looking at a few of the activity possibilities. How
do you know which activities to select? Use two criteria. First think about the
learning objective. In which learning category does it fit? Is it knowledge, skill,
or attitude? Match the learning category to the activity. These examples show
what I mean. Some of the activities can be used for more than one category of
learning. Don’t try to perfect this step. This just gets you started.
Strategies for different learning needs
How do you know which type of activity to select? Remember the three cate-
gories of learning? Use them as a guide. There will still be some crossover,
but it is a place to start.
Different types of learning require different strategies. Match the strategy
(type of activity) to the learning objective. Here are a few examples for you.
Knowledge
If you want people to gain knowledge about something, furnish them with
information through these activities:
 Articles

Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Attitude
If you want people to change their values or priorities, assist them to inquire
into and observe the old versus the new by using these:
 Instruments
 Role plays
 Debates
 Structured games
 Exercises
 Self-analysis
Considerations for selecting activities
What other questions should you ask when selecting activities?
 What is the purpose? Be sure that the design actually accomplishes
what the learners need. If they need practice, don’t provide a word-
match game or a demonstration.
 How well does the activity assist with accomplishing the learning
objective? Sometimes, a learning objective is broken down into smaller
segments. Be sure that the time you invest in activities represents the
most critical of objectives as well as covers the most of each.
 How much time does the activity take? How much time to debrief? If
you don’t know how much time, better try it out with a group prior to
the training. Don’t skimp on time if the knowledge or skill is important.
Also, don’t try to save time by skipping the debrief. Participants leave an
activity without a debrief wondering “What was that all about?” If you do
not have time for the debrief, don’t do the activity. Also consider how
rigid the time restraints may be for the activity and know what you can
do if you run short of time.
 Is the time investment worth the amount of learning that will occur?
Concepts can be taught in many ways. Activities provide a hands-on
opportunity for participants to master knowledge or skills that may be
harder to master through discussion. Because activities take more time,
it is important to be certain that the concepts are related to the most
important learning objectives.
 Will it be fun (or at least stimulating and interesting)? All activities do
not need to be all grins and giggles, but if they are not at least interest-
ing, participants will find something else to do — or at least think about.
 Do all the participants have the minimum skills to contribute and
learn from the experience? Or are skill levels uneven among partici-
pants? Speaks for itself. You may not know about everyone in the ses-
sion; that’s why you’re constantly observing and learning about your
84
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

group. If you suspect that someone will have difficulty, determine how
you can offer support without being obvious. It may be in who you pair
the person with, what you assign the individual, or how you offer non-
chalant sideline coaching. Sometimes, activities can be created in which
those with higher skill level are involved by delivering the content in a
creative way.
 How comfortable does the group seem with the activity? Your needs
assessment should provide information about what is culturally accept-
able in general. In addition, build up to riskier activities as the group is
together longer. For example, role plays tend to be accepted later in the
training sequence.
 Is the activity appropriate for the size of the group? Some activities
that focus on creativity or mental imagery may seem threatening in
small groups. On the other hand, some groups may be too large for cer-
tain activities or there may not be enough space to have small groups
spread out to complete the activity.
 Does this activity maintain the tone and climate the participants
need? If you’re trying to build teamwork, it may not be wise to interject
an activity that tears apart what you’ve built. If you’re encouraging par-
ticipation, you may think twice about an activity that the quieter people
may deem threatening.
 Does the activity have enough real-world relevance for this group? If
it doesn’t, you may wish to find another or add the relevance that is
missing.
 How flexible is the activity? Mold the activity so the participants are
able to easily relate to the situation. 
 Will you be able to easily provide clear, succinct directions? The
easier the better. Remember you may have 20, 30, or more participants
in your training. If the directions are complex and you still think the
activity is worth it, plan for how you can ensure the directions are fol-
lowed. Here are three ideas. You could have the directions printed on
cards for each group. You could have key parts of the directions posted
on a flipchart. You could dispense the directions in small doses.
 Will the learning that occurs be straightforward? If participants end
the activity with much to be explained, you will frustrate the learners.
Better skip it.
 What is the timing and the sequencing of the activity? Avoid conduct-
ing two similar activities back to back. Think about the time of day, as
well. Incorporate activity and movement immediately after lunch.
Increase risk as you move through the day.
 How may logistics affect the design? If you need to travel, you may not
want to lug lots of props. It may be difficult to conduct a relay if the room
is not large enough. If two trainers are available, you may be able to
85
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

include demonstrations or role plays. Equipment availability also shapes
the activities you select.
 Will the experience and the debrief provide participants with the skill
or knowledge they need to acquire from the activity? Will you be able
to easily relate it to the previous as well as the next training module?
Finally, how will you evaluate the effectiveness of the activity you chose
or designed?
It may seem like a lot of questions. If you’re new to design, go through each
one. Trust me when I say that eventually this will become second nature to
you. You will read a learning objective and immediately have an idea of what
activity type will work best.
One last word about activities
Activities can be fun to design and to plan into your training. Remember that
balance is the key. To be most successful with activities or games in your ses-
sion, you must be sure to do the following.
 Have a purpose. Don’t plug a game into a training session just because
you have a space. Design it into the session.
 Know the activity. During the design stage, try out any activities on a
small group to see whether they accomplish the purpose for which you
have selected the activity.
 Think variety. As you design the training program, include different
types of activities. It is unlikely, for example, that you would use more
than one case study in a day when you have so many different activities
from which to choose and so many learners with different learning 
preferences.
• Reach visual learners through color, charts, pictures, and video
clips.
• Reach auditory learners with debates, group discussions, and 
stories.
• Reach kinesthetic learners through role plays, games, and practice.
 Create a consistent theme. As you design a training program, think of a
theme that you could use throughout, or an early event that you could
return to, to create consistency. In the “All about icebreakers” section
earlier in this chapter, I describe how I have participants introduce
themselves using a T-shirt. I continue to use the T-shirts that partici-
pants created during the icebreaker throughout the training program.
How did I do that?
The group was in the team-formation stage, so I used it as a team-building
exercise. Throughout the three days, participants wrote on each others’
T-shirts, completing these statements:
86
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

• Something I learned about you today is. . . .
• One thing I learned from your presentation is. . . .
• Something I’d like to know about you is. . . .
Finally, I used the T-shirts to bring closure to the session by having partici-
pants write on at least two other participants’ shirts with a request to “stay
in touch” and add their telephone numbers.
Adding Zest with Visuals
I can’t imagine facilitating a training session without visuals. They are so
useful! Here’s what’s available:
 Computer projection systems
 VCRs, DVD players
 Overhead projectors
 35mm slide projectors
 Flipchart easels and chart packs
 Blackboards, whiteboards, and felt boards 
 Electronic white boards
 SMART Boards
 Props
Knowing why you need visuals
Why use visuals? The benefits far outweigh the problems they cause and the
time it takes to create them. The first bullet is the most important one on the
list.
 Participants grasp the information faster, understand it better, and
retain it longer
 Clarifies a point (a picture is worth a thousand words)
 Adds variety
 Communicates message both visually and aurally (through your 
presentation)
87
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

 Emphasizes a point
 Makes you more persuasive
 Helps you be more concise 
 Enhances a transition to change the focus
 Adds color 
 Keeps you organized and on track (visuals cue you about content and
what’s next)
You’re sold on using visuals. Now what do you need to know during this
design stage?
Creating effective visuals 
As you design the visuals that will support your training, ensure that you
remember what makes them effective. Visuals are most effective when
 They are relevant to the subject.
 They are visible and understandable.
 Page orientation is consistent, using either landscape or portrait.
 Words are large enough to read.
 They are oriented to the listener: “Here are four ideas you will. . . .”
 Color is used appropriately.
 The typeface varies in boldness and size.
 The print is in both upper- and lowercase.
 The typeface enhances the readability (usually a sans serif font).
 Bullets set off each point.
 They enhance your performance rather than replace it.
 The visual becomes an extension of yourself.
 They are tied together with a common element, for example, sketch,
graphic.
 They are customized for the group.
Designing PowerPoint presentations
Most trainers use PowerPoint as their visual design tool of choice. PowerPoint
is an efficient tool, but when overdone can lose its effectiveness.
88
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Keep the limited flexibility in mind because it is not easy to change the
slide order or to add content while you present using an LCD projector. 
 Use a graphic theme and stay with it for the most part; try something
other than the canned PowerPoint formats — seeing the same format
has become passé.
 Use a template that has a fresh look and one that uses a minimum per-
cent of the screen.
 Follow the same 8 x 8 rule as for overhead transparencies; 6 x 6 is better
for larger groups.
The 8 x 8 (or 6 x 6) rule refers to the number of lines down and words across
a visual.
 When presenting a list, design it so you can reveal text one line at a time. 
 To further emphasize the line item you wish to discuss, change the color
of the newest item or have the previous items fade subtly.
 Headings should be about 44 pt and body 32 pt but no less than 24 pt.
 Select one primary transition throughout the content for each module. 
 Limit colors to two per slide plus black.
 Fade to black to signal a new module or if you want to pause for discus-
sion or an activity.
 Use a subtle background.
 Ensure that there is enough contrast between typeface and background;
light on dark is preferred by many.
 Use clip art sparingly and don’t try to be cute.
 If you use animation, select one type and use throughout a module or
content section.
 Keep sound effects brief, and make sure they add impact.
Designing or selecting film, DVD, and video
A video or film clip adds a surprise element to a training session. To be effec-
tive, follow a few guidelines.
 Develop program objectives first, and then select.
 Media should be proportionate in length to your session.
 Show only the portion required to make the point; provide a brief expla-
nation about what happens up to this point.
89
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

 Provide an introduction that includes the title and tells why you’re
showing the film.
 Preview before showing.
 Devise open-ended questions that clarify the objectives of the film and
create discussion following it.
Designing overhead transparencies
Although most trainers use PowerPoint and an LCD projector, remember the
value and the flexibility that overhead transparencies provide when you keep
a few design elements in mind.
 Use a variety of colors, but avoid yellow and use red and orange for
highlight only.
 Add clip art, sketches, and graphics.
 Add a frame.
 Maximum of eight lines vertically and eight words horizontally.
Some designers advocate a 6 x 6 rule, six lines by six words. This is a
good rule if your audience is large, but 8 x 8 works well in a typical train-
ing group of fewer than 30 participants.
 Proofread text carefully.
 Use only data needed to get your message across.
 Use headlines.
 Use a pencil to number the transparencies in the upper-right-hand
corner.
 Use overlays to provide dimension and progression to your final message.
Designing flipcharts
Design flipcharts? You’ve got to be kidding! No, I’m not. Planning an effective
flipchart page is just as important as a PowerPoint slide. I usually sketch out
the design and words on paper so that when it comes time to actually put the
words on the chart paper, I know what I want it to say.
 Plan the order of the charts and remember to include blank pages for
participant ideas and brainstorming.
 Plan for clear and descriptive headings.
 Consider using a box, cloud, underline, or other graphic to set off the
heading, especially if you may use more than one page for one topic.
 Identify the specific words you will use.
90
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Know whether you will want to leave space to add information during
the session.
 Plan for letters that are 1 to 3 inches high and for ten or fewer lines per
page.
 Plan sketches ahead.
If you have a model or drawing that you like, but you’re not an artist, trace it.
Create the flipchart ahead or take a copy to the training setup with you for
tracing. If you use a model more than once and participants do not interact
or write on the chart, you may wish to have it designed professionally as a
poster.
 A design that includes bullets can help guide learners. 
• Numbers suggest a process, sequence of events, or priority.
• Bullets suggest a list without priority. 
• Boxes suggest something that may be checked off after it is com-
plete; for example, learning objectives for the session.
 Design the colors of markers; for example, two different colors for
every other idea on a list, dark colors for words and bright colors for
highlighting.
Inexpensive, clear plastic protector sheets are available for flipchart-sized
pages.
Designing handouts or participant books
Participant handouts should not be just a page full of words. You can ensure
that handouts and other printed participant materials are effective if you con-
sider these ideas:
 Know how the handout will function in terms of note taking, for an exer-
cise, and as a future resource.
 Use heads and subheads in a variety of type sizes and degrees of 
boldness.
 Don’t mix too many typefaces.
 Experts recommend that you use a serif typeface, which makes the let-
ters appear to flow from one to the next.
 Use graphics and sketches.
 Use bullets, dashes, borders, indentations, and margins for ease of 
reading.
 Number the pages.
91
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Designing a Finale That Brings Closure
It’s 4:25 and your session is scheduled to end. Do you just say “That’s all
folks. Goodbye!”?
Well, of course not. While closing is a small portion of the training session, it
is an important one. Just how long is this part of the training? If it is a half-
day session, you need at least 15 minutes. If it is a two-or-more-day session,
plan on at least 30 minutes. If you test participants before they leave, add
time to complete the test. Remember these are just guidelines from my expe-
rience. You may have a unique situation. 
The conclusion should provide a sense of closure for the learners. It should
also create an anticipation for applying what was learned. So what can you
include in the design to bring about closure?
 Ensure that expectations were met.
 Provide a shared group experience.
 Evaluate the learning experience.
 Request feedback and improvement suggestions.
 Summarize the course accomplishments and gain commitment to action.
 Send them off with a final encouraging word.
Ensuring that expectations were met
One of the easiest ways to do this is to design time into the agenda to go back
to the participants’ expectations they shared at the beginning of the session.
Did you accomplish all that was expected?
Providing a shared group experience
You may wish to design a closer for your session. It may be used to state a
commitment about next steps, review key points of the training, plan for the
next actions, or identify how to apply what was learned. It may also be used
to celebrate success.
If the group has bonded, you may also wish to do something that helps keep
people in touch with each other if they work in different departments, at dif-
ferent locations, or even at different companies. A list of names and e-mails is
an easy perk to supply.
92
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

I usually design a large group send-off experience. An old favorite goes like
this. Have all the participants stand in a circle. Ask them to state what they
are going to do as a result of the training within the next ten days. I like this
for two reasons. First, each statement gives other participants ideas of other
things they could implement. Second, this call to action helps participants
bridge the distance back into the real world.
Evaluating the learning experience
You will want to develop an evaluation for the session. Remember that you
may need to evaluate at a couple of different levels. Chances are that if you’re
new to designing training, someone else will assist you with the evaluation
for the session. You will find additional information about evaluation in
Chapter 13. 
Requesting feedback and suggestions
You may also wish to design time into the agenda to obtain verbal feedback
and suggestions from the participants about how to improve the session
before you offer it again.
Yes, you may ask some of those questions on the paper evaluation that you
design. On the other hand, the group discussion often provides more useful
ideas because they can be clarified.
Summarizing accomplishments and
gaining commitment to action
I usually build this into the shared-group experience in some way. You may
wish to use a game, or, if time is critical, you may wish to conduct a brief
large-group discussion at the close of the session. Examine the expectations
and the learning objectives to ensure they were all accomplished. Then ask
for volunteers who could talk about how they intend to implement what they
learned back on the job.
In the case of the train-the-trainer presented throughout this chapter, partici-
pants wrote a memo to themselves regarding two performance improvements
they intend to make. When most people were finished, I asked for volunteers
to share one of their improvements with the rest of the group. They placed
the memo inside an envelope and addressed it to themselves. I collected
them, and one month later, mailed the memos to each trainer.
93
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Sending them off with 
an encouraging word
One last thing I like to do is to put up a cartoon, a quote, or some inspiring
thought that is both rewarding to them and pertinent to the next action they
must take. In the case of the train-the-trainer session, I did two things. The
first thing I did was to use a mind-teaser.
 They were concerned about how they would remember all that they had
learned. I have a slide that I put up in cases like this. The slide can be
interpreted two ways — with exactly the opposite meanings. Therefore,
I ask people to read it out loud as soon as they see it. The slide says:
“OPPORTUNITYISNOWHERE”
• Some read this as “opportunity is nowhere.”
• Others read it as “opportunity is now here.”
 I explain that just as the letters are the same and can be interpreted two
different ways, they are leaving the session with an experience that can
be interpreted by them in two ways. They have an opportunity to
believe they will be successful or to believe they will not be successful.
And no matter what they believe, they will be right. It is really about atti-
tude. The right attitude goes a long way with skills that are maturing.
The second send-off was that I asked them to take their T-shirts with them. I
encouraged them to take them home and hang them on their refrigerators.
This is a super activity, especially if they have children. Mommy and Daddy
are bringing home their school work! It opens discussions at home about
what happened in the training. The T-shirt motto is an interesting discussion
point, but it is the comments that colleagues wrote on the shirt that is even
more interesting to families.
Lastly, stand at the door, shake participants’ hands, wish them luck, and say
goodbye.
Be sure to design enough time into the plan to include a proper send-off.
Nothing is more discouraging than to have the training session fall apart
during the last hour because it is behind schedule or that the design is not as
tight as the rest of the session. 
The schedule for the last 35 minutes of the train-the-trainer looked like this.
 Reviewed expectations on wall chart: 5 minutes
 Self memo (two performance improvements I will make): 10 minutes 
 Volunteers shared with larger group: 5 minutes
94
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Evaluated the learning experience: 10 minutes
 OPPORTUNITYISNOWHERE: 2 minutes
 T-shirts and goodbye: 3 minutes
Pulling It All Together
At some point you need to capture your design on paper. Most designers use
a simple matrix to organize their scheme. Later, a trainer’s manual may be
written with much more detail. But for now, something simple will serve you
well. The design guide that I use has four columns like the one you see in
Table 5-1. Think of the design guide as a blueprint if you were building a
house. Use it to capture your plans. You see that it has just enough informa-
tion so that you can capture the flow of content from a big-picture perspec-
tive. You identify the knowledge or skill and the activity or method you
intend to use. List also the support materials (participant handout, media or
visual, prop) required and how long each item will take. If you’re like most
trainers, you have too much in your initial design. You may have 7 hours of
available face-to-face time with your learners, and your design is 12 hours
long. Trust me, that’s normal.

Before you begin filling the blanks, think about the factors that affect your
design and the strategies you may consider. The next two sections in this
chapter present you with these considerations.
95
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

Factors that affect a design
Every training design you create will be different. That, of course, doesn’t
mean that you cannot use aspects of a design or modify a design for two dif-
ferent purposes. You can. If you design often, take care that you do not fall
into a rut of doing the same things over and over. Try something new. It keeps
your designs fresh and keeps you inspired and interested.
Think of these factors as the big-picture items you should think about before
putting design pen (or keystroke) to paper.
 Content: How do you determine content? Content should be a natural
offshoot of the learning objectives. Include what the participants need to
know — not what would be nice to know. If you’re a subject matter
expert (SME in trainer jargon), you may have most of the information
you need. However, if not, or if you need additional facts, you can start
here.
• Research: Start with the Internet or your organization’s library.
• Brainstorm: Get a group of people from your department together
to identify resources and materials that may already be available.
• SME: Identify the subject matter expert and ask what you need to
include. Be sure that the SME understands who the target audience
is and their skill and knowledge level.
 Time available: How much time will be allowed for the training? The
amount of time available for training has been decreasing as organiza-
tions find they cannot spare people away from the worksite.
 Participants: If you did not gather this information during the Needs
Assessment stage, find out now the number of participants, how familiar
they will be with each other, their level in the organization, and their
knowledge level of the content.
 Culture: Determine anything unique about the culture of the organization
or the department that may be a concern as you develop the materials.
 Cost: Find out how much money has been budgeted for the design and
development.
 Trainer’s experience and expertise: Assess your skills and knowledge.
Do you have the ability to develop your own activities and participant
handouts? Perhaps you need to rely on purchased off-the-shelf materi-
als. Chapter 6 provides you with a way to evaluate the usefulness of off-
the-shelf materials.
96
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Strategies for a good design
Of course you want to design the best darn training possible. The following
guidelines help you determine how to do just that.
 Variation: Use as many different methods and types of activities as 
possible.
 Timing: Plan for a high level of activity after lunch, decide on the best
time for breaks, increase risk slowly, and so on.
 Participation: Design activities to keep participants involved and
engaged.
 Sequence: Content should build on itself.
 Application: Design activities that relate directly to the learner’s real-
world needs.
 Lecturettes: Remember, lecture when you must, but keep it short and
involve the participants.
Table 5-2 is a sample of the completed Design Guide I developed for the train-
the-trainer session you read about in this chapter. I must admit that it is
much more complete than the actual guide I completed. As you acquire more
design experience, you, too, can begin to take shortcuts.

As you examine the sample guide can you see some of the strategies I planned
into the design?
 Sequencing of topics to build on each other as well as difficulty within
the role play
 Variation in types of methods 
 Variation in pace from moving around to sitting alone for self-assessment
 Variation in grouping size: pairs, five, self, large group
 High level of participation
 Variety in who learners are learning with
 Critical skill receives more time
 Minimal amount of time spent “telling”
Developing materials
Materials support the training you have designed. You either develop or pur-
chase these materials, which supplement and support each learning experi-
ence. Materials may include some or all of these:
98
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Participant material that includes at least the handouts and/or manual
with information and note-taking space.
 Media or visual support such as a PowerPoint presentation to guide a
mini-lecturette.
 Activity support that the participants may need for the activities such as
role-play cards, self-assessment instruments, or checklists.
 A trainer’s manual to guide your facilitation or for others who may facili-
tate the session.
 Administrative support that you use in order to keep yourself organized
or to complete the administrative requirements of the session. It may
include an agenda, roster, supply checklist, certificates, and evaluations.
When developing the participant materials, don’t try to include everything
on paper. The activities you design tap into the knowledge, experience, and
expertise of the participants. Participants should have a place to capture
ideas they may want to use after the session. Allow space for note taking.
Do consider job aids, checklists, reference cards, and other guides that can
be used after the completion of the session. Investing time to develop these
materials, especially for tasks that are done infrequently or for complicated
tasks, is a good decision. You still include these tasks in the design, but you
free up some classroom time instead of increasing the amount of practice
time for tasks that may not be completed very often.
Essential components
Desktop publishing has taken most of the pain out of creating participant mate-
rials. As you design them, begin by knowing what content you will include and
how participants will use them. Will they be assigned reading prior to the ses-
sion? Read during the session? Basis for an exercise? Backdrop for taking
notes? Future resource? What else should you remember?
 Make it easy to read and quick to find information by breaking up the
text with heads and subheads in a variety of type sizes and degrees of
boldness.
 Use short paragraphs and wide margins, leaving space for taking notes.
 Use bullets, dashes, borders, indentations, and margins to enhance each
page.
 Write in a conversational tone.
 Use graphics and sketches, even just lines and boxes, to set off key con-
cepts and to add interest.
 Number the pages.
99
Chapter 5: Developing the Training Design

How about a trainer’s manual?
Your trainer’s manual may be anything from your notes written on the partici-
pant handouts to a complete manual with references to the training plan, facil-
itation tips, time use, media and visual list, and masters for the participant
materials. A well-designed trainer’s manual:
 Uses icons.
 Has plenty of room for writing notes.
 Identifies everything you need to know at a glance (what visual you’re
using, what page participants should be on, what materials you require,
and so on).
 Provides you with either a lead-in statement, a transition statement,
or both.
For now, I suggest that you allow someone else to worry about writing a
trainer’s manual. The preparation chapter provides a few ideas for what you
can do to personalize your manual.
Whew! That’s all, folks! As you can see, the design and development stage of
The Training Cycle requires lots of work. You may decide to purchase off-the-
shelf materials instead of designing them yourself. However, you most likely
still want to customize them for your organization. In that case, most of this
chapter can help you with that task. Chapter 6 is all about selecting off-the-
shelf programs. 
The design and development of training is a big job, but don’t forget to have
fun and to build fun into your design. You can do it. I pass on Henry Ford’s
advice: “Whether you believe you can or you can’t, you will prove yourself
correct.”

N
o time to design? An off-the-shelf product may be your answer.
You may just not have time to custom design a training program, especially
when the training must be given immediately. In addition, some basic training
principles are so universal that creating something new isn’t necessary. Some
examples include topics like supervisory basics, time management, meeting
management, and stress management.
At times like these, trainers turn to vendors who create off-the-shelf training
programs for a living. To maximize these products, you can spend a little time
creatively customizing the off-the-shelf programs for your organization.
This chapter explores how to be savvy about selecting off-the-shelf materials
and how to customize them after your decide to use them.
The Art of Selecting Off-the-Shelf
Training
At first glance, purchasing materials that have already been designed and are
packaged, tested, and ready to implement may appear to be a perfect solu-
tion. What are some of the possibilities for pre-packaged training?
 Presenters and speakers from consulting firms, speakers bureaus, and
universities.
 Films and video on almost any training topic.

 Public seminars offered regularly by training and consulting firms; some
are on a regular travel schedule presenting in most large cities.
 Packaged training programs that come ready to unwrap including the
participants’ materials, a trainer’s guide, media and visual support, com-
puter support and programs, and even the job aids, the “cheat sheets”
that participants take back to the workplace to remind them of what
they learned.
 Customized training packages designed by training and consulting firms
but created to your specifications; most start with a needs assessment
(see Chapter 4).
Make or buy? That’s the question!
With so many opportunities to purchase training off-the-shelf, is there ever a
reason to actually go through all the trouble of designing your own training?
Well, yes, there is, especially when you need to make some changes to the off-
the-shelf training, as many organizations do. Examine the pros and cons of
off-the-shelf training in Table 6-1.

Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

What should you know before you buy?
If you’ve decided to buy an off-the-shelf program, find out the following about
the package and the company before you buy:
 What’s the track record of the company? What is its reputation with
other vendors? Ask to see its client list. 
Ask whether you can speak with clients who have used the product you’re
considering. Most people ask for a couple of names, and most consultants
give you the names of their most satisfied customers. Instead of doing
this, I suggest you ask for the entire client list and select from it.
 What kind of support will you receive from the company? Will it pro-
vide a pilot program? Does it provide train-the-trainer sessions? What
other startup support can you expect? Who, specifically, will be working
with your organization? Keep in mind that the salesperson is rarely the
trainer or the designer.
 Who is responsible for getting the work completed? Have this person’s
name in writing. Find out what you’re responsible for and what your con-
tact person is going to do.
 What’s the timeline for completing the project? If you’re speaking to
a salesperson, find out when the development staff will start to work
with you.
 What, exactly, are you purchasing? Participant materials? Trainer’s
guides? Media support? Do you actually own the materials, or are you
buying the rights to use the materials one time? Can you deliver the pro-
gram to other employees later? Or will you always need to rely on some-
one from the company to conduct future sessions?
 What’s the quality of the materials? Are they written in terms consis-
tent with your industry? Does a version exist that is specific to your
industry? Do the examples match the situations your employees face? If
not, can they easily be changed? 
 Does the program include a trainer’s manual? How complete is it? How
easy to use? 
 Do you know how much you’re paying? The absolute bottom line with-
out any hidden costs, for example, travel or supplemental material that
isn’t included in the cost.
 Do you believe that the company knows enough about your situation
to recommend the training program that you’re considering? Why?
What makes you think that?
103
Chapter 6: Using Off-the-Shelf Training

 How consistent are the objectives of the program with the needs of
your organization? In fact, are the outcomes presented as learning
objectives or vague results? Does the program offer an ample amount
of hands-on practice?
 Is the program rich in content? Is it based on adult learning principles?
Is it interesting, engaging? Does it offer a unique twist?
 How will your most critical participants view the program? Will they
see relevance to the organization? How will your typical participant’s
experience and expertise match the program?
 How well does the design match your organization’s culture? How well
does the design match your organization’s training philosophy? What
percent of the program is dedicated to theory? What percentage to real-
world examples? What about hands-on practice and role plays? Are a
variety of activities introduced? Does the program have backup activi-
ties? Is the time used efficiently?
 What about the logistics? Where will the training occur? How many
trainers will you pay for? Who supplies the equipment? What if the
trainer is ill the day of the training? What’s the backup plan?
Vendors are interested in selling you a product. Be sure that you have all of
your concerns and questions identified prior to meeting with them. Don’t buy
until you have all questions answered to your satisfaction.
How can you make sure off-the-shelf
training meets your needs?
You’ve completed your analysis, and you have decided that an off-the-shelf
program will meet your needs this time. What can ensure a wise buy?
 Know your objectives. Before reviewing an off-the-shelf training pro-
gram, make sure you have clearly stated the learning objectives the pro-
gram must accomplish. Look for the off-the-shelf program that most
clearly fits the needs of your stated objectives.
 Make sure it’s the best fit. Look for a program that is designed for your
industry (participants in manufacturing will not be very interested in a
program geared to retailing, for example).
 Consider buying from a vendor who is willing to customize for you.
These folks have the “core” topics for any program but are willing to
adapt them to fit your specific training needs.
104
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Molding It to Meet Your Needs
After you’ve selected the packaged program you desire, customize the mate-
rials to make them truly yours.
Adapting the design
Buying a training program isn’t always as easy as it sounds. To ensure that
the design achieves what it needs to, you will most likely need to adapt the
design to your organization.
 Circulate the off-the-shelf program to key managers and participants. Ask
for their suggestions to make it a perfect match for your organization.
 Review the program well in advance of the training. Make notes in the
margins using company examples, anecdotes, policies, and so on that
bring the topic home.
 Weave your organization’s core themes and philosophies into every part
of the program. The skills and behaviors taught may be generic, but the
way your organization applies them is not.
 If a technical process or procedure is being taught, add or delete steps to
be consistent with the way the process is performed in your organization.
 If a behavioral skill is being taught, add comments that reflect your orga-
nization’s management beliefs and philosophy regarding the behavior.
Off the shelf, out of the can
When the training is in your hands, you can take a few steps to make it look
less like a canned program and more like yours.
 Give the program a new title that reflects the essence of your organiza-
tion and what it is facing.
 Consider including an “extra” something (posters, wallet cards, job aids)
that is specifically customized to reflect the policies and principles of
your organization. 
 Massage the media. Can the handouts, overhead projection visuals, and
PowerPoint presentations be slightly reworked to reflect your company’s
personality? For example, can you add your logo, change department
names to actual departments in your organization, change job titles to
actual jobs?
105
Chapter 6: Using Off-the-Shelf Training

 Review models, case studies, role plays, and group activities. Can you
change the issues being discussed, modeled, or worked through to
reflect current issues at your organization?
 Consider putting the training materials in your organization’s own binder.
 Delete portions of the package that are not pertinent to your organiza-
tion. For example, if the material discusses dealing with field offices and
your company has only a headquarters office, delete the section for
working with the field.
 Add portions to the package that are pertinent to your organization but
are not a part of the packaged program. For example, if your organiza-
tion has a values statement, add it to the package and adapt the package
accordingly.
Adding Creativity to Training
Creativity is an important aspect of all training, whether you’ve designed it
yourself or you are adapting an off-the-shelf program for your organization.
 Promote your next training session in a unique way, for example, by
sending the invitation in a paper bag.
 Title your next training session in a creative way, such as “Bag That
Problem.”
 Hold your next training session in a unique location.
 Introduce new ways to think about the training topic.
 Use themes to energize a session, for example, paper bags, crayons,
seeds, hats, maps, airplanes, tools, puzzles, T-shirts.
 Use at least three different training techniques or methods per hour of
instruction.
 Use cartoons with the names of managers in your organization.
 Look for double meanings in the words and topics of your training, and
then play with those double meanings. For example, trainers often claim
to have a “bag of tricks.” You could play off of the “bag” theme or the
“tricks” theme. Use a “bag your problem” activity or use magic tricks as
an analogy to some of the knowledge you are training.
 Encourage participants’ creativity; engage them in brainstorming.
 Present your participants with challenges, puzzles, and brain teasers.
 Keep a creativity file that you can refer to when you develop your train-
ing programs.
106
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Use energizers often. Be sure they are short, quick, and, of course, ener-
gizing! An energizer is a brief activity, exercise, or brain teaser offered to
re-ignite the group’s energy.
 Add planned humor to your next training session. Be sure to use your
funny experience as an example.
 End your training session with a story, poem, quote, picture, or gimmick.
For example, thrusting a straw through a raw potato to demonstrate the
importance of seeing success and following through.
 Read as many articles and books about creativity as you can.
 Shop in toy stores, dollar stores, and children’s bookstores for ideas.
 Ask participants to evaluate your training program with a limerick.
 Take more risks; try things that you have been reluctant to try. For
example, I avoided using debates in the classroom for too many years
because I was afraid to take the risk. When I did finally use a debate, I
was pleasantly surprised about participants’ willingness to get involved,
as well as the richness of the follow-up discussion.
 Trouble getting folks to return after a break? That’s probably a good sign
that they are communicating during the break. But you do need to start
again. Use a cartoon or flick the lights. You may also signal with a noise
maker, like a train whistle, kazoo, cow bell, chime, or sleigh bells. Try to
vary your approach from one break to the next. 
Another way to get participants’ attention is to snap your fingers. I begin
snapping my fingers and quietly say, “If you can hear me, snap your fin-
gers.” Participants in the front can hear it the first time. I repeat myself
and eventually the snapping works its way to the back of the room.
 Study other presentations you see and identify new approaches to use
during your next training.
107
Chapter 6: Using Off-the-Shelf Training
Caution: Stick-in-the-muds ahead
No matter what you add to your training design
to make it fun and interesting, you must con-
tinue to keep the learning objectives in front of
you. I purposefully do not call active learning
methodologies “games.” Using that term implies,
unfortunately, that the training session is all
about having fun, not about learning. 
Even though you and I know that people do
learn and remember when they are having fun,
be cautious about the label you use. “Learning
activity” just sounds better outside the session
to people who weren’t there to see all the learn-
ing that occurred.

Take a list of key concepts for your next training session with you to your
local dollar store. Compare the concepts and the merchandise in the store to
identify themes for your next training session. For example, you can use play
money for investing in your future, your health, or your team; puzzles for
finding the right fit or everyone has a role; a compass for finding your way
or determining a new direction; rulers for measuring potential, setting goals,
or determining growth; or hundreds of other ideas. 
Adding creativity to your training session adds to the entire learning experi-
ence and creates an adventure for your participants. As Helen Keller said,
“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.”

Chapter 7
Be Prepared to Succeed
In This Chapter
 Preparing your training environment
 Preparing your participants
 Preparing yourself for facilitating
 Understanding training styles
“P
roper preparation and practice prevent poor performance.” As a
new trainer in the early ’80s, this is one of the first messages my col-
leagues shared with me. I later leaned that Bob Pike coined and published this
statement that he calls the six Ps of an effective presentation. Bob believes
that 80 percent of being a good trainer and getting people involved depends
upon adequate preparation.
A training session may at times seem like the proverbial iceberg: Participants
see only the top 10 percent. And I think that’s the way most trainers want to
keep it. 
In this chapter, you discover how to address the other 90 percent that’s
below the surface: How do you prepare the environment, the participants,
and yourself before the training experience? You know you need to be pre-
pared to succeed, and this chapter gets you there.
Preparing Your Training Environment
When your participants walk into the training session, what do you want
them to see? Empty boxes turned on end? Chairs awry? Technicians scurry-
ing about trying to get your PowerPoint up and running? Facilities people
moving the refreshment table to the back of the room and bringing extra
chairs? You running to and fro trying to find missing materials? Of course not.
You’re letting them see the other part of the iceberg.

Establishing an environment conducive to learning is a critical aspect of
starting a training session off on the right foot. You can ensure that partici-
pants walk in to a relaxed atmosphere and an environment that is welcoming
and ready. The room says you took the time to get ready for them. You have
time to greet them and welcome them to a great training session.
After reading this section you may be amazed at how much time you will spend
preparing the environment for your participants. Believe me it is worth every
minute. The more time you spend in the room, the more comfortable you will
be during the training session. Make the room yours so that when participants
arrive it will feel as if you’re welcoming them to your space.
Know when, where, what, who
It seems logical that you would know the logistics of a training site, yet every
trainer I’ve met has encountered at least one training nightmare. Some (not
all) of these could be prevented by additional preparation. These questions
may help you obtain the right information, but it will do you little good if you
don’t write the answers in a safe place. 
 When: When is the training? Day? Date? Time? Also, do you have enough
time to prepare? Is the amount of allotted time for the amount of content
adequate?
 Where: Where is the session? On-site or off? If off-site, is it easy to travel
to the location? How do you get there? What’s the address? Telephone
number? Will you need to make travel arrangements? Is public trans-
portation available? How do you get materials to the site?
 What: What kind of training is being expected? What resources are
required? What kind of facilities are available? What will you need?
 Who: Who is the key planner? Who are the participants? How many?
What’s their background? Why were you chosen to deliver the training?
Who is the contact person at the training site? How do you reach that
person on-site and off?
Lots of answers. Write them down.
Room arrangements
Your room may have significant impact on your training session. Arrange the
room to support the learning objectives and the amount of participation you
will desire. 
110
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Typically you will not have the opportunity to select a room. However, if you
do, consider the attributes that will create the best learning environment for
your participants.
 Size: Arrange for a room to accommodate the number of participants.
Remember that a room that is too large can be as bad as one that may
be too small.
 Training requirements: If the training session entails many small group
activities, determine if there is enough space in the room. If not, arrange
for additional breakout rooms to accommodate your needs.
 Accessibility: Ensure that the room is accessible to all, including those
who have limited mobility.
 Location: If participants need to travel (either by foot or vehicle) to the
session, the location should not pose a hardship, for example, walking in
rain, or parking difficulty.
 Convenience: Readily accessible restrooms, telephones, snacks, lunch
accommodations, and so on help ensure that participants return on time
following breaks or lunch.
 Distractions: Select a room that is free of distractions and noise. Thin
walls with a sales convention next door may not create the environment
you’re trying to establish for learning.
If you’re in a room with a telephone, turn the ringer off and provide an
alternate number for participants who need to be available for messages.
Set a message center up outside the room; sticky-back notes available for
leaving messages may be adequate.
 Obstructions: Select a room that is free of structures such as posts or
pillars that may obstruct participants’ views.
 Seating: Select a location that provides comfortable, moveable chairs.
Seating arrangements should further enhance the learning environment
you wish to establish. Determine what’s most important for the learner.
There are probably two dozen ways you could set up the training room.
The seven seating arrangements in Figure 7-1 are typical. Consider the
advantages to your participants for each arrangement. Table 7-1 pro-
vides guidance about why you may select each.

 Furniture: In addition to decisions about the seating arrangements and
the kind of tables you prefer, you will want a table in front of the room
for your supplies and equipment. Don’t allow too much space between
the table from which you will present and the front participant row. I
usually allow just enough room for me to squeeze through when I move
from the table to roam about the group. Reducing the amount of space
between you and the learners increases the affect level in the room. It
113
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

closes the distance between you and the trainees both physically and
emotionally. The participants feel better about you, themselves, and the
training session. 
You may also want to consider positioning a table for refreshments in the
back of the room. Located there, it can be easily serviced throughout the
day. One more thing. Don’t forget the wastebasket! In my experience nei-
ther training rooms nor hotel conference rooms have wastebaskets.
Remember to ask for one.
 Lighting: Lighting should be adequate. Dimly lit ballroom ambiance will
not promote energy in a training session. Is the lighting bright enough?
Is it natural lighting? If the room has windows, which direction are they
facing? Can windows be darkened, if necessary? A morning sun coming
up behind your projection screen will blind the participants and wash
out the image on the screen. Know where light switches are located so
that you can brighten or darken the room as needed.
 Workable walls: Most trainers hang flipchart pages on the walls: the ses-
sion objectives, small group work, and so on. Is wall space available or
do windows surround the room? Does art cover the walls or are they
open? Usually the front of the training room should be opposite the
entrance to avoid distractions when folks come and go. Is that possible
in the room you’re considering?
Use markers that absolutely do not bleed through so there is no danger
of ruining walls. The only brand that I know lives up to this expectation
is Mr. Sketch. Not only that, but they smell good as well — scented like
cherry, mint, orange, licorice, and blueberry!
 Climate control: You will never be able to please everyone in your ses-
sion. However, if you have the ability to adjust it yourself, you can try.
Determine where the thermostat is located and whether you have any
control over it. Experiment with it while you set up the room. Does it
respond quickly or slowly? Do you need to contact someone to make
adjustments?
When adjusting thermostats, make changes one degree at a time and
give the equipment time to work. Large changes in the thermostat will
cause a once too-cool room to become too warm.
 Microphone: If you have a large room or a large group or the room has
poor acoustics or you have a tiny voice, you may need a microphone.
Check the room to ensure it is wired for a microphone.
Equipment and visuals
It seems that if anything goes wrong that interferes with conducting the train-
ing session, it will have something to do with the equipment.
114
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Your media and visual equipment — LCD, VCR, overhead projector, 
flipcharts — all help participants understand the message faster and easier.
But when something goes awry, it can spell disaster. Preparation can prevent
some potential headaches.
Preview one week before the event
 Set up the machines and go through all visuals.
 Practice with PowerPoint and overhead slides to ensure they are in order.
 Experiment with dissolve enhancements, animation, and sound effects.
 Practice with the equipment you will use, even the flipcharts require you
to practice your flipping, ripping, and hanging techniques.
Set up the day before the event
The best thing you can do to be prepared for a training is to set up the day
before the training is scheduled. If anything is missing, or if anything goes
wrong, you will be happy to have learned about it a day early.
 Be certain the equipment works.
 Focus all equipment and set the volume level where needed.
 Check volume control and know how to adjust it.
115
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed
How does your training chair stack up?
Have you ever attended a full-day training 
session sitting on a hard chair that was not
adjustable? Most people have, and that’s why
trainers are interested in providing the most
comfort possible to learners. Providing the right
chair is critical. If the chair is too small and
uncomfortable, participants fidget and get irri-
table. If the chair is too comfortable, partici-
pants may fall asleep.
The chair that you use should allow participants
to sit comfortably for six hours. What is the per-
fect training chair? The ideal training chair
should include these features:
 Has a back.
 Is adjustable in terms of height.
 Has adjustable arms to relieve body fatigue
by supporting some of the weight. The fore-
arm should be positioned at a 90-degree
angle from the upper arm.
 Is upholstered in fabric (not vinyl).
 Has wheels so participants can move
chairs to small groups easily.
 Swivels so participants can easily move
with the conversation of the large group.
 Is at least 20 inches long and 20 inches
wide.
Stacking chairs, most often used in training
rooms, meet very few of these standards.

If playing a DVD off a computer, be sure to check the quality of the sound
because the speakers on the computer may not be as good as they need to be.
 Make sure that the projector has the right lens and that it is clean.
 Clean the light source and the glass of the overhead projector.
 Mark the projection table placement with masking tape on the floor.
 Check that the screen is large enough and placed where you want it.
How large of a screen do you need? The distance from the participants
should be six times the width of the screen.
 Tilt the screen forward at the top to avoid keystoning (the image distor-
tion caused when the projector beam doesn’t meet the screen at a 90-
degree angle).
 Check the seats (sit in them) to make sure everyone can see.
 Decide whether you need to dim the lights; do so only if you must.
 Cue up the VCR.
 Plan ahead to know where you will be standing.
Prepare for an emergency
Although you can’t be prepared for every emergency, you can prepare using
these suggestions:
 Bring an extra bulb to the session. 
 Know how to change bulbs.
 Learn a few troubleshooting tricks for the equipment you use most often.
 Pack an adaptor plug and perhaps an extension cord.
 Pack a roll of duct tape to tape down stray cords.
 Have an alternative plan if the electricity fails — that may mean markers
and a flipchart.
Special computer considerations
If you’re teaching a computer class or using computers during the training
session, take special precautions. Unless you’re a computer troubleshooting
whiz, have someone who is available when you set up and as you begin the
session. Check out a few other things prior to the session.
 Make sure that you have the name and contact number, including cell-
phone number of the person who will assist if you have difficulty.
 Ensure that the computers have the correct software and version
installed.
116
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Make sure that you have been informed of the log-in ID and password
required to access the computers.
 Determine who is responsible for providing discs or other special com-
puter supplies.
 Supplies you may want to add to the training kits described elsewhere in
this chapter include a long telephone cord, power strip, remote mouse
with extra battery, and a screwdriver (if you’re traveling by air, you’ll
need to place it in checked luggage).
 Bring electrical tape if you will work in a makeshift lab to tape computer
cables and other cords out of the participants’ way.
Setup tricks for flipcharts
When your flipcharts are prepared, you will feel more organized and ready to
conduct the session.
 Use a design you create on paper to guide your writing.
 Write on every other page (so you can’t see through to the next page).
 Use a variety of dark colors; use red for emphasis only.
 Use numbers, bullets, boxes, and underlining.
 Some trainers like to use two different marker colors for every other
idea on a list.
 Letters should be 1 to 3 inches high.
 Pencil cues in the margin.
 Print; do not use cursive writing.
 No more than ten lines per page.
 A misspelled word can be cut out with a razor blade; tape clean paper to
the back and rewrite the word.
 Bend corners or use tape tabs to find and turn pages more easily.
 Adjust the easel to a comfortable height.
 Position the easel where you want to use it.
Plan flipchart placement so that your back is to the least number of 
participants. As you face the audience, the chart should be to your non-
dominant side if you use it mostly for writing. It should be to your domi-
nant side if you use it mostly for pointing to content. I usually have two
charts, one for each purpose, and more if the participants will use them
for listing ideas or decisions in small group activities.
 Make sure the easel is securely locked and balanced and that the pad is
firmly anchored on the easel.
117
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

All this equipment preparation may seem like a great deal of work. The first
time something goes wrong, however, you will appreciate the attention to
details.
Preparing Your Participants
Preparing your participants is tricky. What you think will work to get them
involved in the session probably won’t. And what you think may be minimal
preparation is perhaps the best thing you can do. Imagine that! As you peruse
some of these ideas, remember you’re working with adult learners. You will
see Malcolm Knowles’ adult-learning principles are alive and well.
Preparing participants: What works?
How do you help prepare your participants before the session begins? I have
found all of these to work:
 Connect with them before the session. Let them know what’s in it for
them (Bob Pike calls this radio station WII-FM) by relating it to their job.
Will the session make their job easier? Will it enhance relationships? Will
it show them how to manage time better? Tell them about it.
 Send a welcome letter stating the objectives of the class. Provide an
e-mail address or phone number and welcome them to contact you if
they have any questions.
 Send the agenda.
 Send a handwritten note introducing yourself and stating why you’re
looking forward to working with this group.
 Send a puzzle or brain teaser that arouses their curiosity.
 Send a provocative statement or question that makes them wonder what
you’re up to.
 Send a cartoon that is pertinent to the session.
 Send the welcome letter in a unique way. One example is to send it in a
paper bag. I then used the paper bag as a theme throughout the session;
for example, participants were encouraged to write an issue on an index
card and place the card in a provided paper bag, thus “bagging” their
issue until later.
 Send participants a roster of who will attend the session.
118
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Send them specific logistic information. Where is the training site? What
room? Where can they eat lunch? What time will lunch be held? What’s
the phone number at the site? Will they be able to check their e-mails?
Where can they park their cars? What’s the closest metro station?
 Get them involved early by sending them a questionnaire and using their
responses to tweak the agenda and incorporate their needs.
 Provide participants’ supervisors with a discussion sheet to review. Ask
the supervisors to discuss what they hope the participant brings back
to the workplace.
Preparing participants: 
What doesn’t work?
Through many years of experience, I have also found things that do not work.
Don’t bother with these!
 Don’t send lengthy preread material. It will only be read by two people
and they will complain.
 Don’t send short preread material. It will be read by 30 percent,
ignored by 30 percent, and lost by 40 percent.
 Don’t ask them to write more than a half a page of anything in 
preparation.
 Be sure you have management support. If participants sense that man-
agement is not behind the training, you will expend a great deal of energy
on the issue during the session. Participants may be discouraged when
they walk into the session,
 Don’t send more than one e-mail. If you must send an e-mail, be sure
that you have included everything and that everything is correct, so that
you don’t need to send a second e-mail to correct the first!
 Don’t do nothing. That’s right. Nothing doesn’t work, either. Make at
least one contact with participants prior to the session.
Preparing Yourself
While everything in this chapter is in one way or another preparing you, this
section truly focuses on things you can specifically do, from thinking through
crises that may occur, to practicing your activities, to keeping yourself orga-
nized. The better you’re prepared, the smoother the session will go.
119
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

Prepare to avoid crises 
The key to handling crises in the classroom, those unexpected events that
crop up at the most inopportune moments, is prevention. The experienced
trainer is a close friend of Murphy and his laws of random perversity. A
trainer knows that “If something can go wrong, it will.” As a result, experi-
enced trainers will take every possible step to ensure a problem can be pre-
vented. Furthermore, they have some contingency plans ready if something
actually does go wrong. These pointers will help you prevent catastrophes
during the training session.
 Go through your presentation thoroughly. List every single logistic detail
as you come to it. After you have done this for the entire program, create
a checklist for yourself. Review this checklist one week before the pro-
gram, three days before the program, the day before the program and the
morning of the program. This ensures that you have thought of every
detail on time.
 Have your handouts and visual aids prepared early enough so that they
can be thoroughly proofread and checked to see whether they are in the
proper order. If something is wrong, you will have time to correct it.
 Don’t assume that, just because you reserved a room, it will be there
waiting for you. Reservations and room schedules have a unique way of
canceling themselves. If you’re making a reservation at an outside facility,
write down the date and time you made the reservation, the name of the
person who took your reservation and the confirmation number. If you’re
scheduling a room internally, write down the date and time you made the
reservation and the name of the person who scheduled the room.
 One week before the program call to ensure the room is still being held.
Do the same thing the day before the program.
 Even if the room is available, don’t assume it will be set up as you
requested. To help the facilities people arrange the room, you should
provide them with a detailed diagram of how you want the room.
 The day before the program, you should call to remind them that you
want the room set up that day. If that is not possible, get their commit-
ment to have it set up at least two hours before the program is sched-
uled to begin.
 Get the name of a contact person who will be at the training site on the
day of the training. That person can help you locate any missing materi-
als or fix (or replace) any broken equipment.
 Arrive at least one hour early on the day of training. This gives you time
to set up your own materials as well as time to tend to any last-minute
crises. You may be the one who actually tidies the room, arranges (or
rearranges) furniture, sets up and tests the equipment, and makes last-
minute arrangements.
120
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Know how to change the light bulb for any projection equipment and
make sure there is a spare available.
 Because of the possibility of last-minute crises, have your presentation
completely prepared and rehearsed before you arrive at the training site.
If you plan to do it when you arrive, you may get distracted. Then, when
it’s time to begin, you will not be prepared.
 If you’re flying to the training program, either send the materials (insured)
well in advance or carry them on the plane with you. This will prevent you
from having to worry about them getting lost en route.
When I travel to a site, I pack one master set of participant material in my
carry-on luggage. If the participant materials are not there for any reason, I
can at least have copies made to get the session started.
Of course, no amount of preparation can ensure that your program will go
off without a hitch. Use these tips to deal with catastrophes during the 
presentation.
 If equipment fails, calmly look at the equipment and check for obvious
problems (accidentally turned off, became unplugged, and so on).
 If you’re uncertain about how to fix it, ask for volunteers from the partic-
ipants. There are usually one or two handy people in every program.
 If no one can pinpoint the problem, give the group a five-minute break
while you find help.
121
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed
Check your room
Even if someone else is responsible to set the
room up, check it out. Theoretically, the room
should be set up exactly as you requested.
Practically, it will not be. Some folks like to make
changes because they think they are doing you
a favor. For example, I have found that most
hotels like to set up the room with extra seats
“just in case.” Setting up a room for 26 when no
more than 20 are expected causes a problem in
two ways. 
 First, the empty seats make it appear that
there are no shows, and participants will
wonder why that occurred.
 Second, the additional chairs mean that
people will be farther away from each other
and/or that there may be empty chairs
between participants, making it more diffi-
cult to encourage interaction and participa-
tion.
You may need to do more than just put the extra
chairs away. When presenting at a hotel (even
when I have had personal discussions and pro-
vided detailed drawings), I have had to tear
down the table arrangement and redo it. I will
call facilities, but they are usually delayed,
because of course they think they have com-
pleted this job and are off on another. On some
occasions I learn when the set up will occur
and I try to be present, using the time to com-
plete other setup myself.

 If help cannot be found or if the problem is not fixable, rearrange your
agenda to delete the activity or to have it at a later time when the equip-
ment is fixed or replaced. This requires that you’re absolutely prepared,
know your program forward and backward, and are flexible enough to
see new linkages and sequences.
 Use group problem solving or brainstorming to come up with alternatives
to any problem (for example, overcrowded room, broken air conditioning,
missing handouts). 
 Be prepared for any type of participant response. You may have a group
that refuses to participate, or you may have one where all the individu-
als talk at once. Have a plan for facilitating any type of group.
 Use humor to defuse unexpected situations. Check some of the ways to
add humor listed at the end of this book.
 Most importantly, keep your cool. A crisis situation only becomes a
crisis when you treat it that way. If you maintain your composure under
any circumstance, your participants will assume everything is under
control.
Identifying your training style
Even if you have never trained a day in your life, you have already developed
a training style. Like everyone, you have developed preferences in life. How
you give directions to strangers. How you explain a task to colleagues. How
you clarify information for your spouse. You have developed a preferred way
to do each of these and they provide clues about your training style. 
Several instruments exist to assist you to identify your training style. You
may wish to complete one to determine your style. Most suggest that there
are four styles. You may have learned about your communication style, man-
agerial style, or leadership style in the past. The most important correlation
between training style theory and other style theories is that all styles are
appropriate for different situations. There is no right or wrong style.
What is most important to know about training styles? Consider these ele-
ments as you prepare for your training session. Chapter 11 discusses training
style in more depth.
 Everyone has a preferred training style that has been developing over
the years.
 All styles are appropriate for various situations.
 Each style has advantages and disadvantages.
122
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 Learners each have preferred learning styles, and each of the training
styles affects each of the learning styles in different ways, some helpful
and some less so.
 The most successful trainers will be those who are flexible, that is, they
can adapt their training style to that of the learner.
When you consider all the information based on the research about training
style, one concept remains at the focal point. Trainers must be learner-focused.
They must view themselves as facilitators of learning and guides to the learn-
ers. The learners are central to the training experience. Table 7-2 clarifies the
differences between being learner focused and training focused. Keep these in
mind as you move forward in your growth as a trainer.

As you continue to read this book, you will find that most research and
common opinion favors a learner-focused approach to training. There is
even a movement afoot to change the name of the training profession to
include the noun “learner.” This is a part of the growing pains the profession
is experiencing.
123
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

What you call yourself is less important than what you do. And what you do
as a trainer is to ensure that learning takes place and that the learning is
transferred to the workplace, where performance improves.
Find out who’s in your session
You will want to learn as much as you can about the individuals who will
attend your session. You may have already obtained this information when
you conducted the needs assessment. And you designed the session based
on that information. Now you may want more specifics.
Obtain a roster as soon as it is available and then identify those factors that
will help you plan the level, pace, and focus of your session.
 Their jobs in the organization
 Their levels of responsibility and authority in the organization
 Their understanding of the subject matter, any definitions you may need
to clear with them early
 The reason they are attending this training: lack of performance, new
skills, new employee. Is their attendance voluntary or mandatory?
 Their opinions about the training session
 Unique personalities that may include informal leaders, outspoken
employees, decision makers, experts
 Baggage they may bring with them
 Negative concerns: hot buttons, corporate issues, negative experiences 
Learn what you can about the participants’ schedules. Find out what the
group will be doing just before the training and immediately following the
training. If the session starts early or runs late, determine whether anyone is
in a car pool or on flex-time that will affect their attendance. If the session is
off-site, learn what you can about traffic or parking concerns and the ease of
locating the site and room.
Practice, practice, practice
Master the content of your training session better than you ever imagined. If
you were lucky enough to design and develop the session, you have a head
start. You were involved in the research and discussions so you have experi-
enced the design and the decisions as to what needed to be included. You
have read the background information. You know more about the subject
than what is included in the training session.
124
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

 You may still want to practice some portions of the session. You may
want to practice the activities with a small group to determine timing or
whether the results are as you anticipated. This is a good test to find out
whether the directions are as clear as they need to be. Perhaps ques-
tions arise that you cannot answer. This may still happen during your
training session; you can’t control that. However, a practice run will still
uncover critical flaws or omissions.
 Practice the mechanics of the presentation. If you’re revealing some-
thing to the participants, determine the best time to provide the hand-
out or show the picture or whatever to maintain the surprise element. 
 Practice the theatrics. If you’re telling a joke or a story with a punch line,
practice it out loud. If you need to show emphasis through pronuncia-
tion, with pauses, or through inflection, practice out loud. If you need to
demonstrate something or use gestures to explain something, get feed-
back from someone.
 Practice in the room where you will actually conduct the training. This
helps to make the room feel like home.
 Videotape yourself conducting some of the activities or delivering the
lecturettes. Review the videotape and decide what you still need to
polish.
 Identify questions you will want to ask at specific points of your presen-
tation to elicit another perspective, to check for understanding, or to
generate audience participation.
 Anticipate questions the participants may ask. Plan your answers to
these questions. No, you will not think of everything, but you will think
of some, and this is a good exercise.
Practice is important and you will want to invest time in practicing. However,
what you put in your head is more important than what you put into practice.
In other words, know your material. Read as much as you can about the sub-
ject. Tap into your subject matter expert (SME) for extra tips. Observe the
process. Do the process yourself. Know your material.
Tips for staying organized
Your participants will notice how organized you are. It is a sign of profession-
alism. Get organized. Stay organized. 
Be organized before the session
Create a packing list. I use a generic packing list like the one that follows. This
serves as my guide and keeps me organized when I prepare for almost any
training session. It is generic enough to use for most sessions. As soon as a
date has been established, I begin to complete the information. It is copied
125

on a brightly colored sheet of paper (lime green) so that it is easy to spot
among an avalanche of white paper.

Stay organized during the session
The agenda you provide for your participants helps them stay focused on the
big picture, the learning objectives, and the sequence of learning events. Your
agenda, like the one described in the following section, will be different in a
number of ways. The suggestions provided here work for me. You may have
other ways for how the agenda will help you stay organized.
 Add times so that you can tell whether you’re ahead, behind, or on time.
 Print it on bright paper; I use astro yellow so that if it becomes lost
among other notes on the table, I can easily spot it.
 For cues, have Activity underlined, PROPS in all caps.
 Add corresponding page numbers in participant materials.
Use your trainer’s manual or training notes to stay organized. Underline key
words and highlight key concepts.
127
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

Bring a small travel clock to help you stay on schedule. Even if you wear a
watch, get in the habit of looking at the clock on the table. Looking at your
watch leads participants to do the same thing. If you glance at it too often,
they may begin to get nervous about whether you’re still on time. It’s not a
big deal. It’s one of those small things between being a trainer and being a
professional trainer.

❑Paper clips
❑Blank transparencies
 Emergency items
❑Band-Aids
❑Tissue
❑Sewing kit
❑Lip balm 
❑Cough drops
❑Aspirin
Prepare your body and brain 
Learn to relax your body. Use whatever technique works for you. Some train-
ers see a mental image of relaxing each body part from the top of their heads
to their toes.
Learn breathing techniques. Slow, deep breathing lowers your heart rate and
increases the amount of oxygen flowing to your brain.
Be prepared to give yourself a rousing pep talk. You know ten times more
than any other person in the room. You’re well prepared. You have memo-
rized your introduction, and your media and visuals are well designed. Your
participants are looking forward to being in this session with you. So go out
there and let ’em have it!
Prepare yourself by knowing what you will drink before and during the train-
ing session. 
 Avoid coffee. If you’re new to training, your nervousness may prevent
you from counting how many cups you’re drinking. Adding caffeine to
your presentation anxiety may create a bodacious buzz!
 Avoid dairy products — for example, milk, yogurt — to prevent mucus
build-up requiring you to clear your throat.
 Avoid sugary liquids such as fruit juices and sodas; they coat your vocal
cords.
 Avoid icy beverages because they constrict your vocal cords.
Okay! What’s left? Room-temperature or cool water, warm water with lemon,
herbal teas, and decaffeinated teas or coffee. Remember, this is just to get
you through the first few hours. Later, when your nerves have calmed down,
you can switch to one of your favorite drinks (nonalcoholic, of course!).
130
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

Travel if you must
Travel can be fun and exhilarating or it can be painful and exhausting. This
list of tips for preparation will assist the trainer who travels to training sites.
 Buy wheels. You will need to schlep lots of things. Make it easy on your-
self and purchase luggage on wheels.
 Pack your carry-on luggage as if the rest will not arrive.
• The clothes you intend to wear the first day.
• Personal hygiene supplies.
• A master of the participant materials and all support supplies.
• Your PowerPoint presentation and overhead transparencies.
• Your trainer’s manual or notes.
• A mini set of the supplies you depend on: couple of markers, pack
of index cards, and sticky notes packed in a resealable plastic bag.
 Send participant materials and supplies ahead if you can. Call several
days ahead to ensure that they arrived.
 Personally talk to the contact person for directions to your hotel and
from the hotel to the training site. E-mail a copy of your flight and hotel
information to the person. 
 Exchange home and cell phone numbers with the contact person,
especially if you’re flying in on a Sunday for a Monday training session.
The procrastinator’s checklist
Are you a procrastinator like me? Don’t have time to read this entire chapter?
Here’s a quick and dirty checklist of what you need to do when. The following
list is particularly good if this is the first time you present. On the other hand,
if possible, this is the list I prefer to use each time. 
One week before 
❑Practice your session in front of a colleague, asking for input, feed-
back, and ideas.
❑Know your subject cold. Your confidence will grow if you’re assured
about your knowledge.
❑Memorize the words you intend to use during the first five minutes.
The first few minutes of a training are usually the most nerve-wracking
for a trainer. 
131
Chapter 7: Being Prepared to Succeed

❑Make a list of things you will want to remember to do or pack for the
session: equipment, supplies, how to set up the room, what you will
place at the participants’ seats, and names and phone numbers of
people who will support the session in any way, for example, the
person who has the key to the training room.
❑If you asked participants to complete a survey or other pre-work,
check to be sure you have all the responses.
❑Confirm all room arrangements, refreshments, equipment, and sup-
plies for the session.
One day before
❑Run through the entire session, practicing with visuals.
❑Confirm that you have enough participant materials and all your 
supplies.
❑Check that you have your trainer’s guide or notes and keep them with
you to take to the session.
❑Check on everything you need regarding the training site including
location of restrooms, refreshments, support staff, and so on.
❑Set up the training room, placing tables and chairs to encourage 
participation. 
❑Observe the room’s mechanicals. Will lighting cause any problems?
Windows facing east or west? Determine where the light switches are
located. Figure out where the thermostat is located and whether you
have any control over it.
❑Set up your equipment, marking placement of the projection table
with masking tape on the floor. 
❑Test the equipment. Run through PowerPoint slides or overhead trans-
parencies one last time to ensure they are in order. Practice with the
actual equipment. Do you know how to use the wireless remote con-
trol? Where is the reverse button? Can you roll the pages on the
flipchart smoothly? Is the VCR cued to the correct place?
❑Arrange the participants’ materials on their tables. Place their training
manuals, pens, agendas, table tents, markers, and anything else each
participant needs neatly at each seat. 
❑Place shared materials participants need for small group activities or
exercises in the center of round tables or equally spaced around a U
or other linear placement. These items may include sticky notes, index
cards, handouts, or paper. 
❑Take one last look around. Empty boxes in the front of the room? Get rid
of them. Don’t depend on the cleanup crew to discard them for you.
❑Get a good night’s sleep.
132
Part II: Designing the Best Darn Training in the World 

One hour before
❑Arrive at the training site at least one hour before start time.
❑Complete last-minute setup.
❑Organize the space from which you will train. Tools and supplies are
where you want them: markers are on the flipchart tray, pencil near
your notes, sticky notes and index cards at the side, pointer on the
overhead transparency tray, completed table tent at the front of the
table.
❑Ensure that your notes are in order, turned to the first page, placed
where you can stay organized. Check that your visual support is in
order and placed where you want it.
❑Prepare for emergencies. Fill a glass with water. Find a few paper
towels for an emergency.
❑Ensure cords are covered or taped down.
❑Check that media equipment placement is correct, test it, set to first 
slide.
❑Make yourself comfortable: Use the restroom, get a drink of water.
❑Move around the room and greet people as they arrive up until two to
five minutes before start time.
One minute before
❑Take one more peek at your opening line.
❑Take a deep breath.
❑Tell yourself how phenomenal this is going to be.
❑Find a friendly face.
❑Smile.
❑Go for it!
Being prepared to succeed
There you have it, the long and the short of preparation — list that is. As a
trainer you will find that practice and preparation can make your training ses-
sion all that you had hoped it would be. And that’s something that you knew
before you read this chapter.
To paraphrase Bob Pike from the beginning of this chapter, Publius Ovidus
(43B.C.–17A.D.) said, “Practice is the best of all instructors.”

the best for the participants? What’s your training style
and how can you make it work for you? What do you need
to know about audiovisuals? How do you address group
dynamics? How do you overcome nervousness? And how
do you deal with those pesky problem participants?

f you read the latest adult training, learning, and development journals,
you will see a subtle semantics battle brewing.
Building on the definitions presented in Chapter 2, I want to further clarify so
that you do not become wrapped up in someone else’s cognitive conflict. I
believe this is really about what you do, not what you call yourself. So whether
you call yourself a trainer, a facilitative trainer, a facilitator, a facilitative presen-
ter, or a performance technologist (which is really a role that expands beyond
“implementing training”), the title doesn’t matter as long as you are all clear
about what this person does to ensure that learning occurs. 
I continue to use the term “trainer,” and ask, “What does a trainer do?” “What
skills make a great trainer?” “What’s important about conducting an activity?”
“And if participation is so important, how does a trainer increase it?”
This chapter answers these questions.
Training, Facilitation, and Presentation:
What’s the Difference?
I recently conducted a training session with a co-trainer, who was upset that
I was calling him a trainer. He considered himself a facilitator. Funny thing
though; he did the same thing I did: presented information in small doses,

facilitated discussion, encouraged participation, conducted small and large
group activities, and ensured that participants gained the knowledge and
learned the skills the client expected.
You will run into people, like this gentleman, who get wrapped up in words
and labels rather than just a clear definition of the actual role. The meanings
of words are in people, not in dictionaries. Therefore, I take a pragmatic view
of the definitions and begin to make some sense of them.
Note that this chapter focuses specifically on the trainer’s role of facilitator. 
Are you a trainer or a facilitator?
New trainers sometimes question the difference between the training and
facilitating roles when implementing the training design. In The Winning
Trainer, Julius E. Eitington defines them as follows:
 Trainer: Term used to describe a learner-centered conductor of a course
or program. See also Facilitator.
 Facilitator: A trainer who functions in a way to allow participants to
assume responsibility for their own learning. The term is in contrast to
the more didactic instructor, teacher, lecturer, presenter, and so on.
As you can see, Eitington, for one, believes that the words are interchange-
able because the roles are identical. I do as well. In this section, I continue to
explore the two terms so that you can understand why label confusion may
exist.
Some folks are not aware that the term training brings with it a definition that
encompasses adult-learning theory. It assumes that an effective trainer has
acquired a certain amount of knowledge and a specific skill set. A manager is
a manager. No one tries to tag on another title (well aloud, anyway) that dif-
ferentiates effective managers from ineffective managers.
There may have been a time when trainers were “tellers” of information,
using a didactic model with learners. This was before Malcolm Knowles
started to promote the concept of andragogy in the 1960s. To add further
confusion, some confuse college instruction with training. While it may be true
that college professors should base more of their delivery on adult-learning
principles, some trainers remember their experiences and want to disassoci-
ate themselves from it. Therefore, they give themselves a differentiating title
of “facilitator” or “facilitative trainer.” A trainer is a facilitator. Let me correct
that: An effective trainer is a facilitator. 
Now I add one more dimension: presenter. The definition provided in Chapter 2
states the following definition:
138
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Presenters: Title given adults who deliver speeches at conferences or to
larger groups; minimal emphasis on two-way communication.
Sounds like an ineffective trainer. Wait a minute. Trainers present. They have
to present new information in some way, or what would there be to learn? Do
trainers only facilitate? No.
Trainers certainly facilitate activities. In addition, they also present informa-
tion. An effective trainer makes certain that he or she presents this informa-
tion in a facilitative way. Trainers who are delivering or implementing the
training design (sometimes called stand-up trainers) must master two key skill
sets when they conduct training sessions.
 They facilitate small-group activities, large-group discussions, and learn-
ing in general. 
 They present new information, data, and knowledge. 
Both of these skill sets are requirements for the job. 
Mystery solved. A trainer is a facilitator and a presenter. An effective trainer
understands both roles and the skills associated with each. An effective
trainer implements both roles when delivering training. 
If you, as a trainer, believe that
 Adult learning theory has merit.
 Adults learn best when they are active rather than passive. 
 Adults learn best when challenged rather than talked at.
 Adults learn best when involved rather than observing. 
Then you probably embrace a participative training method, and make an
effort to be an effective trainer who models both facilitation and presentation
skills. You’re an effective trainer.
Use facilitative skills when you present
At some point, trainers need to present information. Sometimes, “presenting”
is nothing more than having participants learn by reading from a handout.
The trainer has presented the activity to the learner. Good trainers require
good presentation skills. Specific presentation skills such as eye contact,
verbal ability, physical control, and others, will be addressed in the next
chapter. But for now, think of the one most didactic learning activity you can
imagine. Did you think “lecture?” Right!
139
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

How can a trainer use a facilitative trainer style to present a lecture? Well,
first of all by not calling it a lecture. Try calling it a lecturette. You may think
this is a minor point, but it will help you stay focused on “brief,” which is
what a lecturette should be.
Besides being brief, you can use facilitative methods to obtain a high level of
participation during lecturettes. Try these suggestions:
 Ask questions during the presentation.
You probably know that you encourage more dialogue with open-ended
questions than closed. However, examine your questions. “Can you iden-
tify ideas for how to move forward?” may at first blush sound like an
open-ended question, but it really is not. It would be better stated as
“What ideas do you have to move forward?”
 Answer questions throughout the presentation.
 Call on individuals for ideas or predictions of what occurs next.
 Conduct round robins to get opinions, ideas, concerns, or questions.
 Form small groups to discuss the information presented.
 Pause and check for understanding from everyone by creating a 
conversation.
 Use humor in the words you use, the examples, or the visuals.
 Involve participants in deciding what they need to learn.
 Pull ideas together from different participants.
 Compare or contrast participants’ ideas.
 Use a parking lot for questions yet to be addressed.
Create a “parking lot” or place for participants to “park” their questions until
adequate information is available to answer them with ease. One idea is to
post a flipchart page with a sketch of a parked car on an easel or on the wall.
Participants can write their questions on sticky notes and hang them on the
page.
 Form buzz groups (two or three people who “buzz” for two minutes in
response to a question) to identify one concern.
 Stop midlecture to ask whether everyone is with you.
 Reinforce those who ask questions or provide answers.
 Integrate quizzes (bingo, crossword puzzles, word completion) within
the context of the presentation.
 Create a conversation between trainer and participants instead of deliv-
ering a presentation.
 Intersperse tasks or demonstrations throughout the presentation.
140
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Develop a handout to follow the presentation with key words from the
presentation; allow room to take notes.
 Design visuals to support the lecturette so that participants can follow
your words visually.
As you can see, there are many ways to make a lecturette interesting and
interactive when delivering information through a presentation.
Sooner or later trainers need to present information. You will be better
equipped to “facilitate” that lecturette if you have mastered both the basic
presentation skills as well as basic facilitation skills.
Facilitating Successful Training
Trainers walk a fine line between being proactive and responsive, between
being flexible and sticking to the agenda, and between presenting content and
facilitating discussion. They must be adaptive to the many learning styles in
the room and supportive of the various requirements of all the participants.
How do they do all this, act as a role model for the participants, and ensure
that the learners have learned all they need to learn?
The 2004 American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) Competency
Study identifies facilitating learning as one of the key actions required to deliver
training. It is described as “adjusting delivery and curriculum to adapt to the
audience and the needs of the learners.”
Throughout this book I have tried to emphasize that training is really all
about the learner. Trainers must provide opportunities for actively involving
participants in their learning. Of course the goal is not just activity and par-
ticipation. The goal is to ensure that the participants gain knowledge or learn
skills to improve performance. Active learning may be incorporated in hun-
dreds of methods (some found in the design chapter) such as role plays, sim-
ulations, games, and so on.
It is not enough for a trainer to cover all the content and ensure that the
learners are involved. A trainer must ensure that learners practiced the skills,
that learning occurred, and that the learners are prepared to perform the skill
or use the knowledge when they return to the workplace. Learners must
transfer the learning to the workplace.
The experiential learning process is often used by facilitators to ensure that
learning occurs and that learners are ready to perform on the job. Participants
learn inductively, that is, they discover for themselves by experiencing the
activity. Other names you may hear used are interactive learning, experience-
based learning, action learning, and discovery learning.

Real secrets of successful facilitation
by Sivasailam “Thiagi” Thiagarajan
Twenty-five years ago, I had this get-rich
scheme: I will videotape brilliant instructional
facilitators in action. I will find common patterns
of behaviors and create a training package
based on these consistent techniques. Then I
will retire to some island in the sun. 
I implemented the project by lugging around a
heavy video camera and recording ten different
facilitators. They were definitely brilliant, but my
behavioral analysis was disappointing. I found
no consistent common behaviors among these
facilitators. To make matters worse, even the
same facilitator conducting the same training
activity employed different behaviors from one
session to the next. To cut the long story short,
I did not become a millionaire, but I discovered
the real secret of effective presentation: Be
inconsistent. In more positive terms, here is the
secret: I f you want to be an effective facilitator,
be flexible, adaptive, and responsive.
To understand this secret, you should under-
stand seven dimensions of facilitation that
enhance or destroy a facilitated activity.
Because each dimension has two undesirable
extremes, I call them the seven facilitation ten-
sions. Here they are with their extreme poles.
PACE: Too slow . . . Too fast
INTERACTION: Too cooperative . . . Too 
competitive
TONE: Too serious . . . Too playful
IMPLEMENTATION: Too rigid . . . Too loose
SHARING: Too intrusive into personal feelings . . .
Too protective of personal feelings
FOCUS: Too much focus on results . . . Too much
focus on the process
CONCERN: Excessive concern for the individual
. . . Excessive concern for the group
Effective facilitation is a balancing act. When
an aspiring facilitator asks me, “Should I con-
duct the activity at a fast pace or a slow one?”
I simply answer, “Yes.” The appropriate location
of an activity along the seven tensions depends
on several factors, including the number and
types of participants and the structure and pur-
pose of the activity. The secret of effective facil-
itation is to make these tensions transparent by
maintaining a balance between the two
extremes. However, “balance” resides in the
perception of participants. Thus, the balance
along the cooperation-competition dimension
may differ drastically between a group from an
ashram in South India and a group from a bro-
kerage firm in New York.
How to prevent tension headaches. You can
use a variety of common-sense tactics to
increase or decrease each tension. For exam-
ple, to speed up the pace, begin the activity
promptly and get it rolling fast. Also announce
and implement tight time limits. To slow down
the pace, avoid time limits. If a team finishes the
task ahead of others, insist on review and revi-
sion. Introduce a quality-control rule that pun-
ishes teams for sloppy work.
You can figure out your own techniques for
increasing or lowering the tensions among the
other six dimensions. To implement these
secrets in your next facilitation session, begin
your activity with confidence. As your partici-
pants work through the activity, continuously
monitor the levels along various dimensions. If
the seven tensions are at optimum levels, do not
interfere with the flow of the activity. If some
tension becomes noticeable, intervene with
appropriate adjustments. Do this as quickly and
as unobtrusively as possible. Continue monitor-
ing the group and adjusting the activity as
required.
Do you think I could make my millions by selling
this flaky, but powerful, advice?

Sivasailam Thiagarajan, most often known as Thiagi, is well known in the
training world as the man who gave games respect in the training room! He
considers himself the resident mad scientist at the Thiagi Group. Those of us
in the training field have him to thank for designing hundreds of games and
sharing both the games and his facilitator concepts in about a dozen books.
Thiagi encourages all facilitators to constantly monitor participant reactions
and switch between the passive and active facilitator roles.
Experience is the best teacher
Experiential learning occurs when a learner participates in an activity, reviews
the activity, identifies useful knowledge or skills that were gained, and trans-
fers the result to the workplace. An American baseball player, Vernon Sanders
Law, stated that “Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first,
the lesson after.” This is the learning process you go through in your day-to-
day life—your life experience.
Experiential learning activities attempt to duplicate life experience. Partici-
pants “experience” what they are to learn before they discuss it.
Experiential learning activities (ELAs) are based on several characteristics.
 They are directed toward a specific learning goal.
 They are structured; that is, they have specific steps and a process that
must be followed to ensure results.
 There is a high degree of participant involvement.
 They generate data and information for participant analysis.
 They require processing or debriefing for maximum learning.
The steps in Pfeiffer and Jones’ experiential learning cycle explain what must
occur during an activity to ensure maximum learning occurs. The five steps
are experiencing, publishing, processing, generalizing, and applying.
Step 1, Experiencing: Do something
This is the step that is associated with the “game” or fun or the experience.
Participants are involved in completing a defined task. If the process ends
here, all learning is left to chance and the trainer has not completed the task.
Step 2, Publishing: Share observations
The second step of the cycle gives the learners a chance to share what they
saw, how they felt, and what they experienced. The trainer can facilitate this
in several ways: record data in the large group, have participants share or
interview in subgroups, or lead a variation of a round robin. Questions the
facilitator may ask are:

143
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

 What happened? What did you observe?
 What occurred during the activity?
 How did you feel about this?
The facilitator typically begins with a broad question and then focuses on
more specific questions. The facilitator may probe for turning points or deci-
sions that affected the outcome. This stage is important because it allows the
participants to vent or express strong emotions and it allows the facilitator to
gather data.
Step 3, Processing: Interpret dynamics or concepts
This step gives the participants a chance to discuss the patterns and dynam-
ics they observed during the activity. Observers may be used to discuss this
step. Questions the facilitator may ask are:
 Why do you think that may have occurred?
 What did you learn about yourself?
 What did you learn?
 What theories or principles may be true based on your experience?
The facilitator will again begin with broad questions and then home in on
more specific questions. This stage allows participants to test hypotheses,
preparing them to apply what they learned. This stage allows the facilitator a
way to observe how much participants learned from the experience.
Step 4, Generalizing: Connect to real life
The key question in this step is “So what?” Participants are led to focus their
awareness on situations that are similar to what they have experienced. This
step makes the activity practical. Facilitators may ask:
 How does this relate to . . . ?
 What did you learn about yourself?
 What does this suggest to you about . . . ?
 How does this experience help you understand . . . ?
 What if . . . ?
This stage ensures that the participants grasp the learning that was intended.
The “what if” question becomes a bridge to the last step, which is application.
144
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Step 5, Applying: Plan effective change
The last step presents the reason the activity was conducted: “Now what?”
The facilitator helps participants apply generalizations to actual situations in
which they are involved. The group may establish goals, contract for change,
make promises, identify potential workplace changes, or initiate any other
actions that result from the experience. The questions that are asked are:
 What will you do differently as a result of this experience?
 How will you transfer this learning to the workplace?
 How and when will you apply your learning?
 How may this help you in the future?
 What’s next?
Participants frequently follow this step with an action plan or at least spend
some time noting their thoughts about how life may be different as a result of
the ELA.
The ELA is a powerful tool available to facilitators. It is time-consuming and,
therefore, is used sparingly. If you decide to facilitate an ELA, don’t take any
shortcuts. The value is truly in the process.
Tips for facilitating activities
Activities are potent learning tools for participants as long as the facilitator is
prepared and follows a few suggestions for conducting them. These tips for
introducing, supporting, and processing activities will help you think through
all the nuances of facilitating activities. 
Introducing activities
Ensuring that each activity gets started efficiently is critical. Use these steps
to ensure that happens. Note that this is prior to the group’s starting an activ-
ity or an ELA.
 Provide brief, general instructions including whether they will need
materials, pens, and so on.
 Establish a clear objective that positions the activity within the context
of the training module or session.
145
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

 Don’t provide too much information if the intent is for the participants
to discover an AHA!
 Use a process to help participants form small groups. Do this now
before you provide more specific instructions. Otherwise, participants
will forget what you told them in the first place!
 After participants are settled in their working groups, ascertain that you
have everyone’s attention. Then provide more specific direction.
 Tell participants how much involvement is expected of them. Depending
on the activity, you may also wish to tell them what will happen after.
Will they be expected to share scores with the larger group? Will they be
working in the same group? Will there be a large-group discussion?
 Distribute additional materials that may be required and demonstrate
any processes that are necessary.
 Announce the amount of time the activity will require. It is a good idea
to post the time on a flipchart so that it is visible to all. If the activity has
steps within the process, you may wish to post a schedule of how much
time should be spent on each step. Suggest any roles that may make the
activity move smoothly: timekeeper, recorder, or a spokesperson.
 Ensure that everyone knows what to do; ask if anyone has any questions.
 Circulate among the groups to ensure that everyone understands the
activity.
Supporting activities
Facilitators can be quiet guides to ensure that participants are successful
with their activities. Facilitators will walk among the groups to ensure that
everyone understands the task, stays on track, and reaches the end. Note
that this would actually occur during the activity or step 1 of an ELA.
 During the activity, remind participants of the rules, if necessary.
 Give a “time is half up” signal and a “5 minutes left” or a “1 minute left”
signal. Abrupt commands of “stop” or “time is up” may prevent partici-
pants from achieving the goal.
 You may need to make suggestions about the process. Take care, how-
ever, that you do not give away the answer. Suggesting, rather than com-
manding, allows participants to maintain control of the situation.
 Walk among participants to identify confusion, problems, questions, and
time needed to complete the task.
146
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Adjust time, if necessary, and announce to the group, but only if all the
groups need more or less time. Allowing some groups to have more time
when others finished within the time limit will be perceived as unfair.
 Be sure to debrief the activity at its conclusion.
Processing activities
This is probably the most important part of the activity. If you were conduct-
ing an ELA, then you would be addressing the questions and working through
the process included in steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. Otherwise, you will want to assist
the learners to understand the implications of what they just experienced or
completed. Help them address the importance and the relevance of the activ-
ity to themselves personally. Use these suggestions:
 Relate the activity to previous as well as future training modules. 
 Maintain a facilitative role without one-upping participants’ experiences.
Add information if it is a tip or a technique that will be useful for partici-
pants to understand the content or to improve a skill. However, if you
can add that information at another time, save it until then.
 Share pertinent observations you made during the exercise.
 Avoid teaching, preaching, or lecturing.
 Stress practical application.
 Correct only when participants have obviously come to incorrect solu-
tions, and then use either a questioning technique or participation from
other groups to make the correction.
 Debriefing is required so that learning outcomes can be discussed. You
may wish to record comments on a flipchart.
 You may use representatives from each group to conduct the debrief.
 Even if participants disagree on the outcome, ensure a common under-
standing among the group of what occurred before moving on.
Designing your own experiential learning activity
Each year, over one hundred trainers and consultants submit experiential
learning activities (ELAs) for publication in the Pfeiffer Annuals (one for train-
ers, one for consultants). You, too, can design activities that are customized
for your participants. 
Use Table 8-1 to plan your activity. If you wish to submit the activity to the
Pfeiffer Annuals, contact Pfeifferannual@aol.com for submission guidelines.

Participation Prescription: Continue
to Increase the Dosage
Participation has been mentioned so often that it may seem as if I am pre-
scribing it as the cure-all for learning. Well maybe so. While a participant may
overdose on too much participation, it isn’t too likely. 
Gotta play the game to perform
In Chapter 2, I asked you to remember something you learned in the past 60
days and why you learned it. Now think about how you learned what you did.
Suppose you selected a game or a sport. Did you select tennis, for example?
Perhaps some of these learning activities occurred that resulted in learning.
148
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Someone may have presented you with information and you learned:
• Rules of tennis 
• How to keep score
• Best kind of racquet to purchase
 You read a book about tennis and you learned:
• History of the game
• Where the big tournaments are held
• Simple technique to get started
 Someone demonstrated techniques and you learned how to:
• Properly grip the racquet
• Serve 
• Volley
 You observed several matches and you learned:
• What the courts look like
• Where the players stand to serve
 You practiced by hitting the ball against a practice wall and you learned:
• Eye-hand coordination
• How to direct the ball
• How to position your feet and body
Well, you get the idea. You have learned information and skills, but knowing
the rules and hitting a tennis ball against a practice wall doesn’t mean you
can play tennis. You need to participate in a game with another tennis player.
You need to serve the ball over the net and experience a returned hit. You
need to play in a real match with other people to practice what you learned.
You’ve gotta play the game to perform.
Learners need to participate to increase their performance. They need to be
involved with the other participants to get feedback on what they think they
know. In almost all cases, learners need to be in the game, participating to
learn.
Participants’ expectations of participation
Initially, participants expect you to take the lead in the training session. You
will begin to shift the focus away from your role as the leader and to your
149
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

role as the facilitator as quickly as you can. This will be dependent upon the
experience and the communication skill level of individuals in your group. In
most cases you will have a mix that includes at least three participant types. 
 Some people will be good listeners, use no more than their fair share of
talk time, and contribute when they have something new to contribute.
They will be a joy in your session.
 Others will speak often and long, sometimes repeating what was just said
by someone else. You may wonder if they are speaking just to hear them-
selves talk. Actually they may just be unfamiliar with having airtime in
front of a group, or it may be their rambling style. Whatever it is, you may
need to use your facilitator skills to cut them off or to keep them focused. 
 The third group will be quiet, cautious about volunteering and getting
involved. I generally hold back a bit with these folks. I plan activities that
allow them time to reach their participation comfort zone. I push just a
bit more each time. 
Increasing participation — or why are
they called “participants”?
Throughout this book, I use two terms to discuss the individuals in your
training session: “learners” and “participants.” They are interchangeable, and
you will most likely use a term that is most comfortable to you or that is cul-
turally acceptable in your organization.
Though the learner/participant label has switched back and forth based on
subtle reasons, emphasis on participation has never wavered. An effective
trainer encourages as much involvement and participation by the learners as
is practically feasible. 
Sometimes, obstacles exist that prevent trainers from providing as much par-
ticipation as they would prefer, for example, time limitations, facility availabil-
ity, organizational culture, group size. If those are not a consideration and
you’re still interested in increasing the amount of participation, examine your
competency based on various aspects of delivering training. 
Perhaps you have designed the perfect experiential learning activity. Yet par-
ticipants are not getting involved the way you thought they might. The fol-
lowing areas may give you some ideas of what may inhibit participation and
what you need to do to increase participation in your sessions.
150
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Communication
Good communication skills encourage participation naturally.
 Listen well. This skill is at the top of almost any good-skills-to-possess
list. If you expect participation, this is one you’d better master. You know
all the right things to do: Listen to understand, avoid hasty judgment,
don’t interrupt, ask clarifying questions, and focus on content and intent.
 Accept input. When you receive suggestions, comments, or responses
that are not quite right, you need to accept them — at least initially. You
of course do not want anyone to leave the session with incorrect infor-
mation, but you can thank the person, and then ask the group, “What do
the rest of you think?” 
 Project assertiveness. A trainer needs to be assertive with individuals
at times — for example, disruptive participants, argumentative 
individuals — to ensure participants have the correct information.
 Ask questions. This is probably the most used way to encourage partici-
pation. You may ask closed or open-ended questions or rhetorical ques-
tions. You may ask for volunteers or call on someone specifically. Allow
participants to develop their own answers and accept them.
If you ask participants a question, give them enough time to answer it. If
you answer your own question because you’re uncomfortable with the
silence or because you think participants don’t know the answer, then
eventually, they will let you answer all the questions.
 Encourage questions. If you ask for questions, allow enough time for
participants to formulate and ask them. If you find yourself asking
people to hold their questions too often, it means the participants are
ahead of you. Perhaps there is something wrong with the design. Asking
participants to hold questions is one of the biggest deterrents to partici-
pation. Use the parking-lot tip found earlier in the “Use facilitative skills
when you present” section in this chapter, but don’t overuse it.
 Practice silence. Silence is a way to communicate also. Pause regularly
to allow participants to think and process information. They can’t talk if
you are.
Interpretive skills
The ability to read participants’ nonverbal messages and to understand the
intent of verbal messages, as well as the content, takes communication skills
to another level. Learners need to know that you “get it” to increase their par-
ticipation level.
 Relate to situations. The ability for a trainer to empathize and visualize
from the participant’s view increases participation. Participants gain
trust and believe that you really do understand.
151
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

 Appreciate hot buttons. Know your participants’ hot buttons. If you can
ignore them, do so. If you cannot ignore them, prepare your response so
that you both save face.
 Be sensitive to nonverbal meanings. Watch participants and try to
interpret the messages their nonverbals are really saying. If you don’t
understand, don’t be afraid to ask. Sometimes, this is better done during
a break and away from the rest of the group.
 Translate correctly. Interpreting what participants say and transferring
their thoughts and ideas correctly to the rest of the group verbally or
writing them on a flipchart page encourages others to speak up.
Personal traits
Several basic characteristics will encourage participation if they are evident.
If they are absent, these may discourage participation faster than any others.
 Sense of humor: Use humor to lighten the experience. Laugh at inci-
dents. Laugh at yourself. Do not laugh at participants.
 Patience: Give participants the time they need to learn or practice skills
that will make them successful.
 Trustworthiness: Do what you say you’re going to do.
 Openness to ideas: Be open; at least acknowledge even wild ideas.
 Sincerity: Sincerity may be one of the most important to encourage par-
ticipation. People know if you truly want them to participate. 
Interpersonal style
The style you exhibit allows participants to trust you and adds to their will-
ingness to contribute to the training session. You display a set of characteris-
tics that are natural to your unique style, yet the most successful trainers are
also flexible enough to adapt all the style characteristics required to ensure
participation.
 People-oriented and approachable: Encourage participants to ask you
questions. It’s a good sign if they are asking you questions at break that
have nothing to do with the session. It means they are comfortable
asking for your thoughts and find you easy to talk to. Smile.
 Willing to share yourself: Let people in on who you are. Share some-
thing about you. Share your experiences, your successes, and your fail-
ures. Be real. They will feel more comfortable about sharing something
about themselves.
 Organized: Participants will trust that you can help them if you’re pre-
pared and organized. Being organized also ensures that you have the
maximum amount of time to give to your participants.
152
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Respectful of all opinions: Trainers can’t play favorites if they want to
encourage participation. You don’t need to agree with all opinions, just
respect them and try to understand what it means.
Learning techniques
Effective teaching skills do come into play. Think back to teaching your chil-
dren or younger siblings. You probably used techniques that continue to
work with adults who are learning new skills. An effective trainer will have
adapted some of these learning techniques to adult learners.
 Provide clear directions. Anything that needs to be done correctly
needs to begin with clear directions. Don’t set your participants up for
failure by giving poor directions.
 Catch ’em being good. Reinforce participants as they achieve success.
In addition, provide feedback for the behaviors that contribute to a par-
ticipative environment, such as volunteering and contributing. Say, for
example, “Thanks for doing. . . .” 
 Allow the learning process to occur even if participants experience some
struggles. Survival and learning is often dependent on the process. 
 Provide feedback. Give participants honest feedback about their
progress. 
 Coach. Coach participants about both the skills they are learning as well
as appropriate participation behaviors. 
Think through all the techniques you use to encourage learning. Ensure that
you remember to use adult-learning principles as the basis for your tech-
niques. Don’t destroy the environment for the sake of “the right answer.” For
example, if you ask participants to identify a list of anything in small groups,
don’t follow up with a handout of your list of the same thing. Adults may
resent it, thinking that you could have just given it to them in the first place
or, even worse, that somehow their list was defective in some way and your
list is “the right answer.”
Attending skills
Sometimes tossed in with good communication skills, attending skills in a
training session do much more than open communication. Attending skills
help to show that you care about your participants and that you want them
to succeed. That’s a powerful message when trying to increase participation.
 Provide consistent eye contact. Face the participants; ensure that you
make real eye contact so that you can read them. (Don’t look at the tops
of their heads.) Learn to talk and walk backward. Truly the skill of a
gifted trainer!
153
Chapter 8: Implementing Training Designs: Your Job as a Facilitator

 Balance eye contact. Scan the group regularly. This will help you know
whether anyone is confused, distracted, or focused. This is a critical one
for good participation.
Trainers tend to extend the majority of their eye contact to 75 percent
of the room to their non-dominant side. To encourage participation of
everyone, remember to look at those participants sitting near the front
of the room to your dominant side.
 Demonstrate attentive moves. Move around the room as you encourage
discussion. Move toward individuals to encourage them to get involved
in the discussion or to signal you’re about to call on them.
 Provide affirmative non-verbals. This means body language like nods
and smiles.
 Stay engaged. Even while participants are working on activities or small
groups, stay engaged. This is not a time to call your office or take a
break. Move among the groups, offering assistance, listening for under-
standing, and answering questions.
Process factors
The process you use to encourage and balance participation is the final area
to consider. Participants may interpret a lack of somewhat equal participa-
tion by learners as your playing favorites or ignoring quieter participants. 
 Balance participation. Encouraging the quiet, yet not shutting down the
vocal participants. Reinforcing the correct response, yet not negating
the incorrect. Allowing participants to bring up issues, yet staying on
track. Balance is the job of an effective trainer.
 Maintain flow of interaction. Observe who speaks to whom and how
often. Encourage participants to speak with each other rather than to
direct all comments your way.
 Build participation. Consider how you methodically increase expecta-
tions. You may start by asking for a simple show of hands, requesting
volunteers, using a round robin, calling on specific people, asking indi-
viduals to participate in small groups, and eventually encouraging an
individual to act as the spokesperson for a group.
 Create an inclusive environment. When participants feel psychologi-
cally safe in your session, they will want to be a part of it. Encouraging
everyone to participate, including quiet learners, demonstrates to every-
one (not just those who are quiet) that you value everyone’s opinions. 
154
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

REACTing
There are so many things you may think about to facilitate and encourage
participation. Don’t worry about learning and perfecting all of them. Many of
them will become as natural as good communication skills. That’s because
many are natural. In effect, it comes down to your reaction to the learners
and the learning situation. How do you REACT to ensure an environment that
encourages the best opportunities for participation? How do you REACT to
create the best learning experience? This mnemonic, a tool for remembering,
will help you remember the basics for encouraging participation.
 Relaxed and informal atmosphere
 Encourage participation
 Accept them where they are
 Communication is open, friendly, and honest
 Take control of their own learning
I wish I knew to whom to attribute this quote. I do not. It speaks volumes
about why some facilitators are successful and others are not. Attributed to
anonymous: “Adults want to know how much you care before they care how
much you know.”

S
howtime! You’ve conducted a thorough needs assessment, written clear
objectives, designed an interactive training program, and developed
materials. You’re on! 
Stage Four, Implementing the Design, displayed in Figure 9-1 is most likely the
part of The Training Cycle that most people think about when they hear any
terminology about training. It is certainly the part that everyone sees; now you
can see that it is actually the culmination of a huge effort that focuses on the
learner and what needs to be accomplished to ensure a successful training.
Now that you’ve made it to this point, how do you ensure that you deliver
successfully? This chapter addresses opening the session with a bang and
creating a supportive learning environment. It will share ideas to help you get
to know the participants better and how to continue to address their needs
by training like a pro, using questions and answers that lead to learning, and
bringing closure to the session.

Opening Your Training Session 
with a BANG
You completed all the preparation steps to ensure that the room, the equip-
ment, and you are as ready as you’re ever going to be. You have arrived an
hour early, and you have been welcoming participants as they arrived. It’s
time to start the session. Many things happen when you deliver a training
session, but few are as important as the opening.
You will want your opening to be informative, yet creative. It should be prac-
tical, yet promote excitement. And it should be helpful, as well as enthusias-
tic. Start your session with a BANG!
Build interest in the session.
Ask what participants know and what they want to know.
Note the ground rules and what to expect.
Get them involved.
In the following sections, I examine each of these.

Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Build interest in the session
Start the session on time and grab their attention right from the start. Save
the ground rules and the housekeeping details for later. Be creative with your
opening. You may use props, tell a story, state an unusual fact, ask a provoca-
tive question, or make a promise. Participants will want to know what’s in it
for them: how what they will learn will be useful to them personally or how it
will make their jobs easier.
Ask what participants know and
what they want to know
Understanding your participants’ needs is critical for you, so conduct a mini
needs assessment by asking for a show of hands about their experience,
expertise, or knowledge. This also demonstrates that you want to know
about them. Ask participants about their expectations. Listen well. You may
wish to capture these on a flipchart and then post them on a wall so they can
be seen throughout the session. 
You may wish to have the “expectations” flipchart page prepped with a title.
Although it is a little thing, it sends a message to the participants that you
spent time to prepare for them.
Be honest about expectations that are unrealistic for the session or for you.
For example, if one of the participants wants to learn about a topic that is too
complex or lengthy or will not fit into the agenda, you could say, “We proba-
bly won’t have time to add that to the agenda, but I would be happy to chat
with you off-line or follow up with a reference next week.”
Note the ground rules and what to expect
Save time by stating any given ground rules up front, such as start and end
time (if they are not flexible). Ask participants to add others. Again, you may
wish to capture and post the ground rules for ready reference. What are the
most common ground rules?
No sidebars
Cellphones and pagers on silent mode
No dumb questions
Respect others’ opinions
Timely break
Stop and start on time
Allow for interaction
Participate willingly
Keep an open mind
What’s said in here stays in here
One person speaks at a time
Okay to move around as needed
159
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

Briefly note any administrative details and share what participants can
expect beyond the ground rules. Pay particular attention to the word
“briefly.” Don’t dwell on the mundane. 
If you must provide a telephone number regarding an administrative detail,
post it on the flipchart. If you don’t, you will repeat it a dozen times during
the day.
Go over the session objectives and the agenda so that participants know
what they will learn. Put participants at ease by explaining their role as learn-
ers and how you intend to conduct the session.
I do not put specific times on the participants’ agenda. Participants become
nervous if they see that you’re behind by 30 minutes. They don’t understand
that you may be currently covering something that was planned for later
or that you know that what they are addressing now is much more important
than something later and that you can decrease time on another activity.
I print my personal agenda on brightly colored paper. I use bright paper so
that I can see it if it gets lost under handouts or whatever. I include the timing
of activities so that I stay on track. I like to allow flexibility to meet partici-
pants’ needs, but I also need to take full responsibility for achieving the learn-
ing objectives.
Get them involved
Start with a show of hands, and next help everyone get to know each other.
Participants learn as much from each other as the program, so start quickly
with introductions that are tied to an icebreaker. Knowing something about
the other individuals in the session will make it easier for them to listen, to
contribute, and to get involved. Several tried-and-true icebreakers are listed
in Chapter 23. 
If you want a list of the best icebreaker books, check my Web site at www.
ebbweb.com. I provide a complete resource list to support this book.
The classic four questions answered by participants in a training session
include:
 Who are you?
 Where do you work?
 What do you hope to learn?
 What’s something interesting about you?
160
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

These four questions are usually embedded in the introductions in some way.
Remember that your participants will want to know the same things about you.
Always start on time. Anything else teaches participants that it is okay to be
late. You’re training them to be late. Waiting for a few stragglers punishes
those who made the effort to be on time. If you anticipate a tardiness prob-
lem, you can always be prepared to start with something that is interesting
but not critical for everyone to know.
Identify all that you want to accomplish in your opening. These things may
include:
 Establish a participative climate.
 Introduce participants.
 Introduce the agenda.
 Clarify the participants’ expectations.
 List objectives of the training.
 Build interest and excitement.
 Learn something about the participants.
 Determine some minimum rules of engagement (ground rules).
 Establish your credibility.
Plan how you will accomplish what you need to lay the foundation for the
rest of the training session. First impressions are critical. A good trainer will
catch and hold participants’ attention right from the start. That’s why it is
important to start with a BANG!
Looking at Six Disastrous Debuts
Trainers need to be prepared with an opening — what to say and what to do.
If you’re unprepared, you may find yourself saying things you didn’t mean to
say, getting ahead of yourself, forgetting what you were supposed to say, and
just generally confusing your audience. 
Be prepared so you don’t fall into one of these disastrous debuts:
 Asking obvious, contrived questions
 Talking too much, wandering from point to point with no direction
 Telling individuals they are wrong
161
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

 Making a participant the brunt of a joke
 Forcing your beliefs on the participants, telling them what to do or how
to think
 Trying to be funny
Not one of these works. Trust me. I’ve seen them all. Don’t do them.
Creating a Supportive
Learning Environment
To successfully create a supportive learning environment you need to get to
know your participants, and that means remembering and using their names.
It also means that you will want to let them know something about you.
Get to know your participants 
If you have opened with a BANG and gotten early participation, learners will
expect to be involved in their learning. Don’t change the expectation now!
Continue to implement activities that encourage discussion and involvement.
Begin to call participants by their names immediately to create a supportive
learning environment.
I like to use name tents (cardstock folded in half lengthwise) for their names. I
usually have my name tent completed as a model when they walk in the door. I
also place broad-tipped markers around the tables so that their names can be
written to be seen from a distance. If everyone has not completed the name
tents by the time introductions have been completed, I ask them to do so. 
Have participants put their names on both sides so that you and other partic-
ipants can see the name from all sides of the room.
You started to get to know your participants through introductions and by
conducting a mini needs assessment during your opening. Select questions
that help you better understand the group’s skill level, knowledge, experi-
ence, and expertise. In the case of a train-the-trainer, for example, I may want
to know how long they had been trainers, whether they had ever attended a
train-the-trainer, whether they had designed training, and finally whether
they thought that training was their destined profession. How do you do this?
You may simply ask for a show of hands. If more complex, you may wish to
have them complete a few brief questions. (Note, however, that this process
162
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

doesn’t encourage participation, nor does it inform the rest of the partici-
pants). If you want to add movement, you may ask participants to stand if
their response is yes or to move to a certain spot in the room based on their
response.
Getting to know your participants early in the session is one of the best
investments you can make in the session. After you have created a learning
environment in which participants feel comfortable to participate, to ask
questions, and to learn, the session has the best chance of success.
What’s in a name: Five secrets 
to remembering names 
To establish an environment that is conducive to learning, trainers need to
build trust and let their participants know that they care about them. Because
most people are flattered when someone takes the time to learn and use their
names, this is one obvious way to build a positive environment. Oh no! Can’t
even do that at a party when you meet only one person? Now I’m suggesting
that you learn 10, 20, or more participants’ names all at once? 
Obtain a copy of the roster prior to your training session. I read it over and
try to get a big-picture vision of how many people, men, women, and names. I
also look for names that may be difficult to pronounce so that I can take extra
care to listen when they introduce themselves.
These five techniques will help you as the facilitator to learn participants’
names.
Use name tents
I highly recommend that you use name tents on which participants can write
their names. Name tents are 81⁄2"-x-11" sheets of cardstock that are folded in half
lengthwise and sit on the table like a tent. (Which is why they are also called
table tents.) Most organizations have their logos printed on them. Provide fat,
dark markers so that you can read everyone’s, even those who sit way in the
back of the room. I usually say something like, “Use the marker to write your
name or whatever you wish to be called for the next couple of days (hours)
on the name tent. I have completed mine, and it is sitting up front as a
model.” Sometimes, this is all participants need. They see the model and imi-
tate it before I even say anything.
Ask them to print their names on both sides of the name tent so that every-
one can see it no matter where they are in the room. This is actually as much
help to you as anyone. When you see hands go up to make a comment, a
quick glance at the name tent and you can easily say, “Tedman, how would
you answer that?”
163
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

Be sure you don’t have anything in your line of sight between you and the
name tent — no glasses, no water pitchers, no props. Otherwise, you will
constantly be craning your neck to read names.
Some organizations insist on preprinting the name tents with participants’
names. I oppose this for several reasons. First, there is a chance that a name
is misspelled, or, worse yet, the person’s name is missed completely. Second,
it adds a sense of formality that I do not want as a part of my sessions. Third,
it adds to the logistic nightmare. Participants need to find their name tents in
a stack or someone needs to be available to pass them out. Or a worse solu-
tion, they are placed around the tables and participants are not able to select
where they want to sit. Fourth, and worst of all, usually the typeface is too
small for anyone to read across the length of the room, so it is all for naught!
The only reason you would want preprinted name tents is if the trainer
required assigned seating.
Work the introductions
You may think that you can relax a bit while everyone is going around and
introducing themselves. Perhaps use the time to get organized for the first
information sharing? Not a good idea. Remember these first few minutes are a
critical time to build rapport. As people are introducing themselves, listen to
what they are saying, look at their names on their name tents, and begin to
connect their names and faces. Also, use their names at least twice during
the introductions. You can say, “Welcome [name],” or “[Name], thank you for
telling us. . . .” Start planting those names in your brain.
Use small-group time
I usually have participants remain in their seats for the first small-group
activity. They may either turn to the person next to them or form a group of
three or four sitting next to each other. My rationale is that while they are
completing the task in the small group, I spend a portion of the time match-
ing faces and names again. If I forget anyone’s, the name tent is nearby and
provides the cue for me. I set a goal to know everyone’s names by the first
break. Set a goal for yourself. 
Play a game
Several name games work well. If you have time for an icebreaker that focuses
on people learning each other’s names, you may try these. They are fun, and
they teach everyone, not just the trainer, the names of the participants.
 How Many Can You Name? If your icebreaker includes individuals meet-
ing as many other people as possible, you can let them know that you
will “quiz” them on how many people they actually “meet,” meaning they
remember their names. Before you debrief the icebreaker, ask how many
names each participant remembers.
164
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Chain Name: As you go around the room with introductions, each person
reiterates all the people before. For example, person number one only
introduces himself or herself. Person number two introduces person
number one plus himself or herself. Person number three introduces
number one, number two, and himself or herself. It becomes more and
more difficult, but the rest of the participants begin to help those at the
end. The activity establishes a good environment, and everyone learns
names.
 Doodles: Have participants add a doodle to their name tent. The doodle
must start with the same letter as their first name. For example, Opal
may add oatmeal and Dominick may add a dog. The alliteration will help
you, and the other participants, remember names.
 Name It: When participants introduce themselves, ask them to add
something about their names: the history or meaning of their names,
who they were named after, what they like (or dislike) about their
names, or any other unique fact about their names. The added discus-
sion about the name itself helps everyone to remember more names.
Cheat
Finally, when all else fails, do what I do — cheat. Before the session starts I
draw a sketch of the room and the table arrangement. As participants intro-
duce themselves, I jot the person’s name at the corresponding place in the
sketch. I can use that later as I practice everyone’s name.
Participants feel good when you use their names. Work at remembering them.
Let them know about you
Let participants in on who you are — both professionally and personally —
to create a supportive learning environment. I tend to be low keyed about my
expertise and experience. I may drop subtle hints related to the discussion
or the content about who I am. I would probably not say, “I have written 16
books.” But I would say, “In my last book, I interviewed 45 training managers
who said. . . .” You do not need to be subtle at all. You do want to establish
credibility with the participants.
How about personally? How much you let them in on who you are personally
is entirely up to you. I like to get to know participants, so I spend breaks
with them as much as possible. I find things out about them that we have in
common and then use that information to continue our discussion. Sometimes,
as an energizer, I ask participants what they want to know of each other. I get
into the fray, and they can ask questions of me as well. 
You will want to build professional credibility with your participants. You will
want them to know you as a human being as well. Don’t keep yourself on a
pedestal that prevents you from building rapport with your participants.
165
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

Training Like a Pro
As you discovered in the last chapter, trainers have two key skill sets they
master when they are conducting training. First, they facilitate small-group
activities, large-group discussions, and learning in general. Second, they pre-
sent new information, data, and knowledge. Both of these skill sets are
requirements for the job. I examine the facilitator role in Chapter 8. Now, I
examine how trainers can be effective presenters.
Presentation skills
Trainers need to present information. It would be nice to never have to deliver
a lecturette, but that just isn’t going to happen.
Mel Silberman, author and consultant, is well known for his concept of active
training. Yet he knows that as a trainer you will need to present information
at times. Even, so, Mel believes that participants can be actively involved in
the learning. See his “Ten suggestions to turn a lecture into active learning”
sidebar.
When you present, whether it is a lecturette, simply describing a concept
during a discussion, or responding to a question, the participants will not
only hear your content, but they will also “hear” and “see” your presentation
style. 
It is easier for your participants to learn when your presentation is interest-
ing, and even better when it is exciting. How interesting, competent, and
exciting do you sound? What do participants infer about you based on your
presentation techniques and style?
What do they hear? The six Ps
Vocal expression adds vitality and energy to your ideas. Several characteris-
tics make up the audio part of your presentation. Think of these as the six Ps
of your presentation: projection, pitch, pace, pauses, pronunciation, and
phillers.
 Projection refers to how loudly the message is heard. Do you project
enough volume? Loudness results when air is expelled from the lungs with
maximum force and intensity. The appropriateness of a loud or soft voice
depends on the room size and the need for vocal variety. Variations in
volume can be used to indicate urgency, exasperation, and importance. 
 Pitch in a conversation flows up and down the scale naturally. But when
some trainers stand in front of a group, their voices become dull and flat.
I learned to picture pitch from Kevin Daley, founder of Communispond.

He says to picture pitch, think of the states of Kansas and Colorado.
Kansas is flat; even when you say the state’s name, it comes out quite flat.
Now picture Colorado with its rolling hills, mountains, valleys, streams,
lots of variety. Even when you say “Colorado,” your voice can’t help but
roll up and down the scale. Pitch variety adds interest to your voice, but
it also helps you to emphasize important ideas or to signal transitions.
Both are important to keep your learner tuned in to what you’re saying.
 Pace is the rate of delivery and is determined by the duration of sound
and the number of pauses between sounds. Words can be spoken fast or
drawn out. Like projection and pitch, the pace can also signal importance.
Try saying $50,000 quickly, as if it is just a small amount of money. Now,
say it again, this time slowing your pace and adding emphasis on every
other syllable. It can really make a difference. 
Select a pace that is comfortable for you. Don’t try to speed up or slow
down. Your brain is accustomed to working with your mouth in a certain
cadence. However, if you’re told you speak too rapidly, try punctuating
your presentation with more pauses. Right. Just snap your jaw closed. If,
on the other hand, you’re told you speak too slowly, check on a couple
of things. First, make sure you’re using no fillers. Second, be certain
you’re not repeating the same information. And third, know your mater-
ial cold. Practice your content aloud a couple of extra times.
 Pauses can actually add more emphasis than anything mentioned so far.
A judiciously placed pause before and/or after an idea can focus atten-
tion right where you want it. Pauses allow you time to think. Pauses also
allow you to observe the participants for feedback. Pauses are the sign
of a seasoned presenter, because most inexperienced presenters are
uncomfortable with silence. Practice your pauses.
 Pronunciation is critical to make it easy for your participants to under-
stand and learn easily. Speaking articulately, clearly, and distinctly is a
sign of a pro. Learn to enunciate clearly. Take care that you do not run
words together or let the ends of your sentences trail off so your learn-
ers have difficulty hearing. 
 Phillers are those nasty little nonsounds that sneak in when you aren’t
listening to yourself: um, ah, and ah, er, okay, ya know, like. All are fillers
that can hypnotize your participants into a trance or can grate on their
innermost nerves. No matter which occurs, you can be sure that they
will not hear your content but may instead be counting fillers. The sad
thing is that most people do not hear their own fillers. 
The only way I know to eliminate fillers is to hire yourself an Um Counter,
someone who will listen to your presentation and provide you with feed-
back about how many fillers you use per minute and which ones. The
shock seems to awaken something so that you can finally hear yourself.
What do they see?
The other half of your presentation is what your learners see. What they see
should convey the same interesting, competent, and exciting message. 
167
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

 Body stance is one of the first things participants notice. Good posture
and poise convey confidence in your message, and your participants will
want to know the content. When standing in front of the room, plant
your feet and avoid shifting your weight. Moving around and among the
participants is good. It uses up some of your nervous energy and helps
to create a natural and comfortable environment. However, repetitive
moves, such as pacing back and forth in the same spot, are distracting. 
Try to never have your back to the group. Learn to talk and walk back-
wards! How about sitting? Sitting certainly changes the tone. It would be
rare, but you may sit or even lean against a table. Your stance then says
“informal.” The tenor of the presentation has changed. In the past I have
purposefully pulled a chair in the middle of the room and, while sitting,
had a heart-to-heart discussion with a group that was disagreeable. So
the question is, what is your purpose for sitting? What atmosphere do
you want to convey?
 Gestures help to convey enthusiasm and help your participants follow
your presentation. Keep them natural. If you start with your hands at
your sides, they will come up naturally. Think about speaking and ges-
turing to those seated farthest from you. This enhances your gestures,
as well as your projection. Avoid crossing your arms, playing with your
marker, or touching your head. 
How about putting your hands in your pockets? It depends. Are you
putting your hands in your pockets because you’re nervous or they feel
awkward and you don’t know what to do with them? Or are you putting
your hands in your pockets because you’re relaxed and you want to send
a message of relaxation to your audience? If you’re putting your hands in
your pockets for the first reason, then the answer is no, don’t do it. Your
hands will just get into trouble jangling change. On the other hand, if
your reason is to send a message of relaxation, then fine, go ahead.
 Facial expression should be congruent with your words. In fact, your
face can express more than your words! Facial mobility is an indication
of a relaxed speaker. Use it to add emphasis to your message and to dis-
play energy. Be aware of your expressions and what they may convey. 
Early in my career, I was surprised when a participant said to me, “You
don’t want us to ask questions.” This was of course exactly the opposite
of what I wanted. I did want them to ask all the questions necessary to
understand the skills they were learning. When I asked why she made
the statement, she said, “Whenever we ask questions you frown.” Wow!
I was unaware of frowning. I realized that I was concentrating on their
questions, and when I concentrate my face appears to be frowning. It
was a great lesson. What are your facial expressions saying about you?
 Eye contact is important in all conversations. In the United States it rep-
resents caring, understanding, and trust. Good eye contact builds rap-
port with your participants. Avoid looking at the ceiling. Don’t just
sweep the participants or try to get by with looking at the tops of their
heads. People know whether you’re making eye contact. Good eye 
168

contact means that you see their facial expressions and can tell if they
are following and/or agreeing with you. 
Be sure to look at all of your participants. I find that most trainers ignore
the 25 percent of the people closest to the front on their dominant side.
Are you aware of where you’re looking? One other thing — I have
noticed that good eye contact decreases the number of fillers. Somehow,
it’s tougher to look someone in the eye and say “um!” 
Eye contact is a cultural preference. It is not viewed the same in all cul-
tures. If you’re training in another country or training other cultures in

Ten suggestions to turn a lecture 
into active learning
by Mel Silberman
Lecturing is one of the most time-honored yet
ineffective ways to teach. By itself, it will never
lead to active learning. In order for a lecture to
be effective, the instructor should build interest
first, maximize understanding and retention,
involve participants during the lecture, and rein-
force what’s been presented. There are several
options to do just that. 
Building Interest
 Lead off with a story or interesting visual.
Provide a relevant anecdote, fictional story,
cartoon, or graphic that draws the audi-
ence’s attention to what you’re about to
teach.
 Present an initial case problem. Present a
problem around which the lecture will be
structured.
 Use a test question. Ask participants a
question (even if they have little prior knowl-
edge) so that they will be motivated to listen
to your lecture for the answer.
Maximizing Understanding and Retention
 Reduce to headlines. Reduce the major
points in the lecture to key words, which act
as verbal subheadings or memory aids.
 Use examples and analogies. Provide real-
life illustrations of the ideas in the lecture
and, if possible, create a comparison
between your material and the knowledge/
experience the participants already have.
 Have a visual backup. Use flipcharts, trans-
parencies, brief handouts, and demonstra-
tions that enable participants to see as well
as hear what you’re saying.
Involving Participants During the Lecture
 Spot challenges. Interrupt the lecture peri-
odically and challenge participants to give
examples of the concepts presented thus
far or answer spot-quiz questions.
 Illuminate with exercises. Throughout the
presentation, intersperse brief activities
that illuminate the points you’re making. 
Reinforcing the Lecture
 Apply a problem. Pose a problem or ques-
tion for participants to solve based on the
information given in the lecture.
 Encourage participant review. Ask partici-
pants to review the contents of the lecture
with each other or give them a self-scoring
review test.

the United States, you will of course respect other values. Other cultures
view eye contact differently. Some consider it rude or aggressive. Be
familiar with the culture of your participants. 
 Nervousness is displayed in numerous ways: pacing or swaying, fidget-
ing with a pen, jingling change in your pocket, perspiring, shaking, clear-
ing your throat, grimacing, tenseness, and dozens of other things.
However, if you have interesting content, your participants will not even
notice. The number one rule regarding nervousness is “Do not say that
you’re nervous.” Nervousness is covered in greater depth in Chapter 12.
Check it out for additional information.
How about some feedback?
Feedback is good for learning new skills and improving performance. It is nearly
impossible for you to give feedback to yourself. I recommend that you give a
copy of the form in Table 9-1 to a colleague. Tell them you want honest feed-
back about what they heard and saw in your training. Then, when they share
their observations with you, be quiet and listen. After you have the observa-
tions, you can get started on any performance improvements necessary.

The participants’ materials
Encourage the participants to use the materials provided. First, it will help
them to understand the content better. Second, they will more easily find any
information should they need to after the training session.
 Always refer to every page, even if you won’t use it. Tell the participants
why it’s there, for example, “the resource page is information you may
refer to after you return to the workplace.”
 Decide whether you will have the handouts available as participants
arrive, after the session starts, or at the end of the session. Each has
advantages and disadvantages.
 Remind your participants what page they should be on as you move
through the content.
 During presentations or activities, tell participants whether the informa-
tion is in their manuals or handouts so they can choose whether to take
notes.
Notes: To be or note to be
Whenever I conduct a train-the-trainer session, I am asked about notes.
Should I use them? Or should I memorize everything? Should I hold them?
Should I keep them in the trainer’s manual? Should I use an outline? Should I
speak from key words? Should I use paper? Should I use note cards? Should I
write them in my own words? 
My answer is “Yes.”
There is no secret about using notes as a trainer. Do what works best for you.
My best advice is “Yes, use notes.” Your participants are there to see you suc-
ceed. They want you to stay on track. They want you to remember every-
thing you’re supposed to tell them. They don’t want you to memorize a
“speech.” They want you to converse with them. They want you to be com-
fortable with the content so that you can interact with them and address
their unique needs — even if they aren’t on the agenda.
I cannot advise you of the one way that works best. I can, however, provide
you with a few techniques and ideas from experience. I hope you will try a
couple and find what works best for you.
 Use the trainer’s manual as your guide. If a trainer’s manual has been
developed, it is probably filled with most everything you will need to
conduct the training session. You may want to go through it, crossing off
parts you will not be using or even removing pages that you will not
171
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

need. If it is an off-the-shelf training program, you may want to cus-
tomize it for your organization, adding your own examples, questions,
and stories. See Chapter 6 for ideas about how to do this.
 Use the participant manual/materials as your guide. This is my pre-
ferred method. I start with a participant’s manual. If it is bound and
printed on both sides, I copy it on one side only. I use the information
from the trainer’s manual (if there is one) and add pertinent notes. I note
the time at the top of the page (that it should be when you reach that
particular page). I underline key ideas, add notes about media, props,
or handouts, and include special information about putting the partici-
pants into small groups.
 Develop your own notes. Some trainers create their own notes. This of
course gives you the maximum amount of creative license to develop
your notes so that they work best in your format. Some trainers use an
outline, some use key words, and some develop an entire manuscript.
I caution you about developing a manuscript. It’s a great deal of work.
Also, trainers who tend to do this are usually good writers, and after
they have written their “good stuff,” they want to read it as it is. Be care-
ful. Your learners do not want you to read to them.
Another method is used by trainers who rely on their visuals and media
to guide them through the session. They may add notes on the frames of
their overhead transparencies or in the margins of their flipcharts. Some
develop their notes using the note feature of the PowerPoint slide pre-
sentation and then use the printed pages to guide them.
Experiment a bit until you find the technique that works best for you.
Things I know for sure about notes
Notes will help keep you on track: both time and topic. They are your sup-
port system, so use a format that works best for you
Become intimate with your notes. Practice with them and become familiar
with what’s on each page and where. You should be able to trust that anything
you may need will be found in your notes. Therefore, do not write new notes
just before your training session. Yes, you practiced with them. They are a
little bent and crinkly. You folded them when you didn’t mean to. You even
spilled a little latte on module three. But don’t redo them now. Better that they
are well worn and familiar to you than that they are pretty and aren’t familiar
at all. If you practiced with them, you know where to find the list of five ways
to recognize a good leader and the “don’t forget to tell the learner.”
Number your pages. Whether you use your own pages/cards or modify the
trainer’s guide, number them. If you use the trainer’s guide as a starting
point, you may add pages that are more pertinent or delete pages that will
not be a part of the training session. Renumber the pages. If you drop them,
you will be able to put them in order again. I once sat in the audience and
172
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

watched a man shuffle his notes as he delivered his opening lines. The audi-
ence did not hear a word he said. We were all aghast at what he was doing.
He realized it and recovered by putting us into buzz groups. Fortunately, he
had numbered his note cards.
Cue yourself. Whatever technique you use, develop a plan to cue yourself
about where to find information. Use highlight markers, underlining, boxes,
clouds, arrows, or different colors. You may for example, underline all the
places where you need to use a type of media. You may put stars in front of
the questions you need to ask. You may draw a miniscreen as a cue to use
PowerPoint. You may put red boxes around the times of the session.
If you use the trainer’s guide as your notes, it will give the times in some for-
mula that denotes how far into the training you are. For example, 0315 means
that three hours and fifteen minutes have passed since you started training. If
you actually started at 8:00 o’clock and you have built an additional 15-minute
break into the session, you would replace it with 11:30 a.m.
Don’t fold or staple your notes. Folding them makes them weak, and stapling
prevents you from being flexible with them. I usually keep my notes in a
three-ring binder and remove only the page or pages I intend to use during a
specific amount of time. When I am finished, I return the pages and pick up
the next one or two. I keep the binder at the upper-left-hand corner of the
table. I always know where my notes are.
If you create your own note pages, use a heavier stock of paper. It will hold
up better. If your hand tends to shake, it won’t rattle either! If you use note
cards, use larger cards than the 3 x 5 cards. The larger cards will provide you
with much more flexibility — and of course room.
One last note: Make your notes work for you; don’t be a slave to them.
Asking and Answering Questions
The art of asking and answering questions and encouraging participants to ask
questions is a valued skill of trainers. Don’t take it lightly. Beyond simply elicit-
ing answers or facts, questions can stimulate interaction and discussion.
Questions enable you to assess what your participants know and what they
still need to learn. Questions can be used to emphasize and reinforce signifi-
cant points. Questions encourage participants to evaluate their own knowledge
gaps and think about how to address them. Questions encourage thinking.
Encouraging participants to ask questions ensures understanding, enhances
interest, increases learning, and prompts interaction.
173
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

Encouraging participants to ask questions
Participants may ask questions for different reasons. They may be positive
reasons to acquire information. On the other hand, they may ask questions
to irritate the trainer or to impress other participants. Fortunately, most
often participants ask for positive reasons. So how can you encourage more
questions? 
 At the beginning of the session, encourage participants to ask questions
at any time.
 Go through your training program. Try to anticipate questions that may
come up. During your presentation, pose these questions to the partici-
pants if they don’t pose them to you.
 Stop at natural points in the training and ask for questions.
Have participants work in trios to create a question about the informa-
tion that you’re presenting. Have them write the question on an index
card. Collect the questions and redistribute so that each trio has a differ-
ent question to answer.
 If a participant looks puzzled, stop and ask whether there is a question.
 If two or more participants are talking among themselves, ask them
whether there is something they would like clarified.
 Allow time for participants to ask their questions privately. They may be
too shy to ask in front of the entire group.
Make it okay to ask questions. Assume that there will be questions. At the
same time, convey a message to your participants that you expect questions.
You can do this by how you ask for questions. Instead of saying, “Are there
any questions?” say, “What questions do you have?” It may be subtle, but it
works.
Guidelines for answering questions
These guidelines provide suggestions as you master the art of answering 
questions.
 Anticipate your participants’ questions. Being prepared is always good.
If you get the same questions often, you may wish to add the content to
the training. Practice answers out loud.
 Inform participants of your expectations for asking questions early in
the session.
 Listen carefully to each question for both content (what is asked) and
intent (what is meant). Listen for the emotion that may not match the
174
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

words of the question. If it seems that the individual’s intent doesn’t
match the content, you may be heading for a let’s-see-whether-we-can-
irritate-the-trainer situation. If you do receive a hostile question, avoid
showing your feelings. Remember, the group is usually on your side.
 Treat a “why?” question like a “how?” question. “Why” questions may
put you on the defensive because it seems as if you must justify your
rationale. However, if you think about it from a “how” perspective, you
will respond from a fact basis rather than an opinion basis. For example,
if someone asks you, “Why do you think your process is better?”
respond by stating how your process is better. Do you see the small
nuance that will help you maintain your composure?
 Paraphrase the question to ensure that everyone heard and that you
understood the question. This prevents you from answering the wrong
question. You may also choose to paraphrase all lengthy questions to
ensure clarity.
Another reason to paraphrase a question is that it gives you time to
organize your response before plunging in with an answer.
 Take care with how you paraphrase. You do want to clarify what the
question was, but you don’t want to come across as condescending.
Saying, “What you mean is. . .” or “What you’re trying to say is. . .” may
come across as insulting.
 Keep your answer short and on target. Choose your words carefully.
Don’t build a watch if the individual has only asked for the time. Avoid
using the word “obviously,” because this implies that the participant
should already know the answer. I also try to avoid “you should,” “you
must,” and other terms that appear to be controlling or moralizing.
These words may discourage others from asking questions. 
 Direct your response to the entire group, not just the person who asked
the question. You may start by responding to the person who asked the
question, but then look at the other participants during your response.
This ensures that the rest of the participants feel a part of the discus-
sion. In addition, it discourages the person from tagging on a second
question, which may lead to a conversation between the two of you.
 Watch the person’s body language. If you’re uncertain about whether
you hit the mark, verify your response with, “Is that what you were look-
ing for?” or “Would you like more detail?”
 If you don’t know an answer, redirect it to the participants, to another
source, or state your follow-up plan for getting the information. In addi-
tion, “I don’t know” is an acceptable answer. Just be sure to tell the par-
ticipant what you will do (and by when) to find the information. “I don’t
know the answer to that, but I can call the office on break to obtain the
information.” Don’t make up an answer. Don’t fake it.
175
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

 If the question refers to something you will cover at a later time, ask the
participant to write the question on a sticky note and place it in the
parking lot. Address it specifically at the time that the topic is intro-
duced. 
 I avoid saying, “That’s a good question” or “Gee, I’m glad you asked that
question.” If you provide a compliment after every question, it may
come across as insincere. On the other hand, if you say it sometimes,
some participants will wonder if their questions were not “good ques-
tions” or if you’re not “glad they asked a question.” It may seem minor,
but if you just avoid the situation, it will be one less concern for you.
Asking questions
Questions are wonderful tools to get participation, to personalize a presenta-
tion, or to provoke participants to think about your message. To be effective,
you will want to think about these.
 Plan your questions in advance. When should they appear in your 
presentation?
 Consider your reason for including them. Are you looking for a correct
answer? Are you trying to initiate controversy? Or are you asking a
rhetorical question?
 Early on, ask the question that will yield involvement by the most partic-
ipants. For example, if you’re asking for a show of hands, ask the ques-
tion that will cause the most people to raise their hands in response.
 Keep questions short and clear.
 Ensure that they are relevant to your presentation.
 Know whether you want information or opinions.
 Go from general to specific when asking a series of questions.
 Get participation by asking questions early. Further, be sure to balance
to whom you direct the questions.
 Be sure that you’re asking open-ended questions.
 Say the participant’s name first, and then ask the question. There is no
need to “catch them” in a mini-vacation.
 Pause after asking. Too often, trainers are uncomfortable with silence.
So they will ask a question. When they do not get an immediate
response, they will ask it again. If still no response, they will answer it
themselves. This teaches participants that if they wait long enough, the
trainer will answer as well as ask all the questions!
 Be prepared to take action if you don’t get a response.
176
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Asking questions is one of the most useful tools you have to encourage par-
ticipation. Hone your questioning skills.
Questions in action
Think about how you may be able to apply some of what you just read. Think
about the next training session you will conduct. Then complete the appro-
priate information in Table 9-2.

Now think about your use of questions. How could you make your training
more dynamic by adding questions? Where? What kind of questions would
they be? What would be the purpose? Identify three questions you could ask

Using Smooth Transitions 
Keep your learners in mind as you transition from one topic to the next. Take
them with you on a smooth journey as you move through your agenda. Help
them see the relevance and the relationships. Help them see the big picture
and how things are connected. You will look like the professional that you
are. These tips will assist you.
 When you’re designing the training, make sure it has a logical flow or
sequence. This in itself will enable smooth transitions.
 Make sure you properly wrap up the previous topic before going on to
the next. Ask whether there are questions. When there are no more, say,
“Now let’s move on to ________.”
 Use mini-summaries to transition out of a section. You may present
these summaries, but you do not need to. Ask for volunteers to do this
for the group. Or place participants in small groups and ask each group
to identify two or three summary statements.
178
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Pick a common theme that relates to both the previous and the
upcoming topic. Address that theme while moving from one topic to the
next. Tell them how the role play you just completed is related to the
next module.
 Use the building-block approach. In your transition, summarize the
concepts from the previous discussion that will be the foundation of the
upcoming discussion.
 Use visual cues. If you’re following an agenda or a flowchart, show the
change from one point to the next. I’ve used props at times. For example,
I used two-by-four blocks to “build” a structure when discussing the Ten
Building Blocks of Teams.
 Although it is difficult to practice an entire training presentation, it is
very easy to practice transitions. Go through every lesson of your train-
ing, and write down key points for each. Next, look for relationships with
the activity or presentation before and after. Last, develop and write the
transitions in your training notes. Finally, rehearse them until they are
smooth.
Wrapping Up an Effective Training Session
Remember that the conclusion should provide a sense of closure for the
learners. You have created a design to ensure that the following occur. What
are your responsibilities to wrap up your training session? You will need to
ensure that expectations were met. You may want to conduct a group experi-
ence. Most training sessions end with an evaluation and sometimes ask for
additional feedback for improvement. A closing activity may get commitment
from participants. You will most likely want to have some final words of
wisdom planned as a send-off. The closing is a time to wrap up all loose ends
and shift the focus from the training session to the workplace.
Ensure that expectations were met
One of the most common ways to address this is to review the expectations
that were developed by the participants at the beginning of the session and
posted on the wall. You can also conduct a verbal check with participants. 
Ensure that you have answered all the questions in the parking lot and that
there are no loose ends left undone.
179
Chapter 9: It’s Showtime: Delivering Success

Provide a shared group experience
Many closing activities exist. One of the most creative closing activities I’ve
heard of is to develop a video or a PowerPoint collage. First determine the
equipment you will use. Use it to take a video or pictures of the training room
before participants arrive. Continue to capture pictures of the group through-
out the training session working in small groups, on individual activities, or
as a large group. Be sure that everyone is represented in the shots. If you’re
taking digital shots, put them together in a collage presentation. You may
wish to add appropriate music. Then near the end announce that you want to
show them all the hard work they have completed during the session. Sit
back and enjoy the show. This is a very motivational way to end a session.
Check the resource list on my Web site at www.ebbweb.com for books that
feature closing activities. 
I have taken 35mm pictures during team-building sessions. Then on the last
day I have them developed at a one-hour photo shop. I have doubles made
and share one set with the participants. Again, if you do this, ensure that you
get everyone in the pictures.
Evaluate the learning experience
All training sessions based on an instructional design model will include
an evaluation element. You may evaluate participant reaction, knowledge
gained, application of the skills and knowledge, and/or business results.
Chapter 13 provides more details about evaluation. You may also consider
conducting a feedback session.
You may also wish to request feedback and improvement suggestions for
future sessions. One method that works well is to ask participants what went
well and what improvements are needed. Use two flipcharts with a “What
went well?” heading on one and “What would you change?” on the other. You
may alternate making the lists on both flipcharts at the same time.
Summarize the accomplishments and
gain commitment to action
You may wish to review the agenda and the objectives. Ask whether every-
thing was covered. Commitment to action can be worked into a closing activ-
ity in which you may ask:
180
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 What was the most valuable part of the training session?
 What will you implement back at the workplace?
 What will you change as a result of what you’ve learned?
You may conduct these discussions in small groups that report out to the
larger group. To ensure transfer of learning, you may also want participants
to pair up with a “buddy.” Buddies will support each other after the session
has ended. This is a good time for the buddies to exchange contact informa-
tion and make plans for the first contact.
A favorite activity that I use is to have participants write memos to them-
selves committing to some actions and/or changes. They put them inside
envelopes, self-address, and seal them. I collect the envelopes and mail their
commitment memos back to them six to eight weeks later.
Send them off with a final encouraging
word — or two
Have your ending designed as tightly as you have your opening planned.
Based on this section, you have a number of things to complete. In addition,
you will want to have a formal send-off message for the participants. You
opened the training with a BANG! End it with the same kind of fanfare.
Help participants remember the experience, give them encouragement, and
send them off with something to think about after the session. What could
that be? It could be a call to action, a poem, a quote, a moral to a story, an
anecdote or illustration, a visual, a reference to the introduction, a rhetorical
question, a demonstration, a challenge, a magic trick, or something that
makes the point. I will forever remember stabbing a plastic straw all the way
through a raw potato, as the facilitator said, “Positive thinking moves moun-
tains. Believe that you will be successful and you will be.”
Bob Lucas, author, trainer, and consultant, likes to end day-long training ses-
sions by reading from the Dr. Seuss book Oh, the Places You Will Go! The
book’s message of optimism and reaching goals has high impact. Bob adds
his own statement encouraging learners to achieve their goals.
Lastly, stand at the door, shake participants’ hands, wish them luck, and say
good-bye.
Focusing on the asking-and-answering questions section, a quote by my
favorite author, e.e. cummings: “always the beautiful answer who asks a more
beautiful question.”

Select the Best Visual to Do the Job
You have a number of choices available with regard to the type of media —
everything from computer displays to paper. The media should support your
training session and make it easier for the learner to acquire the skills or
knowledge intended.

What’s available?
PowerPoint presentations have taken the training world by storm. They are
easy and fast to create. The tools to design them are sitting on everyone’s
desktop inside their computers. They can be changed or updated on the
spot. They add color automatically and may include animation and sound
effects or video clips. 
They may also be boring, overused, and less effective than other forms of
media and visuals that are available. This list of media and visual support
provides an overview of what is available to you.
 Computer projection systems: This includes PowerPoint presentations
and SMART Boards. Both use computer technology to project images.
PowerPoint presentations are convenient, and most trainers use the
technology. SMART Boards are a combination of a giant computer
screen and a whiteboard on which you can write. In addition, your hand
can act as a giant cursor to move things from one place to another.
 Videos and DVDs: You may show a video clip to demonstrate a skill,
illustrate behavior, or to have an expert deliver content in a way that
you could not. You may decide to show a video in its entirety or just a
segment that makes the point. You may also use videos to tape partici-
pants’ practice sessions. This allows them to critique themselves. Most
people are their own best critics.
 Overhead projectors: Information written on an 8-inch-x-10-inch trans-
parency is placed over a light source. The light is collected in a periscope-
like device, and the image is projected on a screen. They are useful for two
specific reasons. First, you can write on them while you speak. The trainer
can capture the participants’ ideas and change the projected image as
participants add ideas, respond to questions, or even revise a design.
Second, it is easy to use layers to build a complex model or image.
 Flipchart easels and chart packs: Flipcharts are large pads of newsprint
mounted so that individual sheets can be torn off and hung on the wall
or flipped over the top of the pad. The pad is mounted on a large easel
about six feet high. Trainers can write on them with chisel-tip markers.
Flipcharts work well for creating on-the-spot lists, capturing ideas gener-
ated by the group, and creating real-time plans. There is a sense of
immediacy and spontaneity to the information presented. Flipcharts
are very valuable when you’re called in to do some spur-of-the-moment
facilitating. 
Flipchart packs of paper are available in a preglued format that acts like
a giant sticky notes pad. Pages stick directly to the wall as opposed to
using masking tape.
185
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

 Blackboards, whiteboards, magnetic boards, felt boards: Whiteboards
are making a comeback! A new paint covers an entire wall and has mag-
netic properties so that a trainer can use magnets. In addition, some
training rooms still have boards on the walls or on a movable stand.
 Electronic whiteboards: This whiteboard is combined with a copier
mechanism. It translates whatever you write on its 3-foot-x-5-foot surface
to an 8-inch-x-11-inch page of paper. Participants can each walk out the
door with whatever ideas were captured on the board.
 Props: Props usually do not plug in, turn on, make sounds, show anima-
tion, or have glitches. While props have nothing to do with media, they
may be great visuals. Props capture or refocus attention. They may
serve as a metaphor for any aspect of the content. Props may include
samples, models, demonstrations, or any article that a trainer holds to
drive a point home. The best prop I use is a $20 bill that I borrow from
the leader in the group. I ask whether participants can provide examples
of the cost of waste (due to poor communication, poor quality, or what-
ever the topic is) and begin to rip it up as I restate the examples and
throw the pieces on the floor. It drives the point home that waste costs
money. By the way, I always return the leader’s $20 off-line. It’s a small
price to make an important point.
What are the benefits?
The benefits of visuals to you and your participants are clear. Your partici-
pants learn through their five senses. Research suggests that the proportion
of learning that occurs visually is much higher than the other four senses
combined. Learning that takes place through each is approximately:
 Taste: 1 percent
 Touch: 1.5 percent
 Scent: 3.5 percent
 Aural: 11 percent
 Visual: 83 percent
About 70 percent of Western culture is a visual-learning culture. Adding
visual support to your aural message is a major benefit to your participants.
Participants will grasp the information faster, understand it better, and retain
it longer if visuals are added to your training session.
As you discuss the content with participants, visuals will help you be clearer
and more concise. 
186
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Ensure That the Visual 
Adds to the Learning
I list several types of visuals you may wish to add to your training session.
Under what circumstances may you use each? The following lists a number of
situations in which each media or visual performs best. You will also deter-
mine others depending upon the learning objectives and the curriculum of
your training session.
Computer projection systems
PowerPoint presentations are useful for guiding your participants through
the training session. They will probably be the foundation of your media pre-
sentation with others added as appropriate. You will use PowerPoint for
these at a minimum:
 Provide the outline to the session
 Cue that you’re switching to another module or topic
 Provide introductions to topics
 Present new information in any format
 Present processes in sequential order
 Show relationships, for example, pros and cons, advantages and disad-
vantages, parts to a whole
 Display charts and graphs, for example, bar graphs for change over time
or as a comparison, pie charts to display the division of a whole
 Pictures of new products
 Sketches and diagrams
 Organizational relationships
 Directions to complete an activity during the session
 Mini quizzes or challenges 
 Cartoons (with appropriate copyright approval) or mindbenders
 Video clips of a message from top management or subject matter
experts (SMEs)
 Close the session with a statement, call to action, quote, reference to the
introduction, or a rhetorical question
187
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

SMART Boards have a more unique use. They would not be appropriate for a
large group because most are smaller than the required screen size. Still, they
may be useful for some of the same things. Due to your ability to interact
with them, SMART Boards may also be used to
 Create or revise a document as a small group
 Brainstorm 
 Problem solve
 Change a process
Videos and DVDs
Videos and DVD presentations work well when it is difficult to recreate a sce-
nario in the training session. You may show a clip to do any of the following:
 Demonstrate a skill
 Illustrate behavior
 Deliver content by an expert
 Set up a scenario
 Show the wrong way 
You may tape participants’ practice sessions to allow the following:
 Participants review and critique their own skills
 Obtain feedback from other participants and the facilitator
 Facilitate a comparison to later, more improved skills
Overhead projectors
Use overhead projectors when you do not have PowerPoint available. They
also provide a spontaneous and efficient way to introduce new information
that has not been included in the session. To use overhead projectors to
obtain large-group participation, the facilitator takes notes or lists ideas on
transparencies as participants provide input. Useful at times like these.
 Create a list of ideas as a large group
 Track list of brainstormed solutions or ideas
 Build a model or concept as a large group
188
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Use in small groups to summarize activity and present to entire group
 One of the easiest AV tools and you do not need to worry about a tech-
nology meltdown
 Easy to leave out some transparencies without participants knowing
whether you’re running behind or making a conscious decision to elimi-
nate a portion of your presentation
 Use for same situations as PowerPoint
Flipcharts
Flipcharts are the reliable, no-computer-glitch, flexible tool trainers find
useful. They are the only practical tool that allows the trainer to display infor-
mation for a period of time. As information is recorded or discussed, the
trainer can remove the pages and hang them on the wall. One drawback —
flipcharts are best for groups of 40 or fewer participants. Flipcharts are
portable and an instant resource. Useful for many other situations as well.
 Prerecorded information can be presented like any other media
 Use for spur-of-the-moment facilitation requests
 Capture on-the-spot lists
 Record input and ideas generated by the group 
 Create real-time plans
 Track action items, next steps generated during the session
 Brainstorm ideas
 Reinforce or supplement a lecturette 
 Track participants’ questions or concerns
 Display lists or content throughout the session
 Make a decision by voting with sticky-back flags 
 Prioritize a list of items by having the participants vote with stickers
 Used by small groups to organize their results
 Emergency backup when any technical equipment fails
Boards of all types (including electronic) 
Whiteboards, magnetic boards, and all other boards can be useful when avail-
able in these situations:
189
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

 Use for same situations as a flipchart
 Use for building a description step by step
 Tack up ideas, questions, or concerns 
 Hold, display, and/or move sticky notes for discussions
 Create an affinity diagram
 Prioritize a list
 Group ideas into categories
Props
Props include a diverse assortment of three-dimensional items that the par-
ticipants use for discussion or practice. They may be used as practical
hands-on support.
 Display samples of product, errors, and so on for participants to examine 
 Introduce models of actual equipment, locations, buildings 
 Practice skills using actual tools, equipment, or materials
 Demonstrate a correct process or procedure
 Use props as a metaphor to make a point visually
 Make a closing statement
Look Like a Pro
A trainer is a professional. Using visuals can enhance your image and increase
the confidence participants have in you. On the other hand, if you do not
have professionally designed visuals, if you have not practiced, and if you
don’t know the best way to use them, your participants may lose all confi-
dence in you.
Visuals are only effective when
 They are relevant to the subject. 
 They are visible and understandable to the participants.
Use the following tips to ensure you look like the professional you are. First
attend to the general tips useful for all visuals and media. Following those
tips, you will find guidelines for using each of the types of media discussed.
190
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

The Competency Study from the American Society for Training and
Development (ASTD) lists presentation tools and media as key knowledge
required for delivering training.
Tips for using visuals in general
Experienced trainers have learned a number of tips to ensure that they pro-
vide the best learning experience for their participants.
Participants must be able to see the visuals
Some of the best presentations are doomed for failure if the participants are
unable to see the visuals. These tips will prevent that from happening.
 Don’t block the view.
 Sit in the participants’ seats to ensure that they can see the visuals.
 Visuals must be readable. Keep a tight focus on what is shown.
 Reveal only one point at a time.
 Limit the number of ideas on one visual to four.
 Use a pointer to focus attention.
Cocktail sticks work great as pointers for overhead transparencies.
They are pointed, and the light shows through those that are colored
and translucent. 
 Turn projection lights off between visuals.
PowerPoint presentations can dissolve to a black slide so that participants
are not distracted. You can also force a black screen by touching the “B” key.
Orient the visuals for the learner
Imagine that you are one of the participants and that you are seeing the visu-
als for the first time.
 Tell learners what they are looking at: “Here are four criteria for percep-
tion checks.”
 A good visual may not need words to describe it.
 Allow enough time for people to take notes.
Be well-practiced
It should be comfortable and natural to use your visuals. That comes with
practice.

Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

 Charts roll easily (you may need to practice this).
 You know how to operate the equipment.
 You have prepositioned your equipment and organized your supplies
beforehand.
 Turn off the projector at the end of the last frame, transparency, and
so on.
 After its use, leave the equipment alone until after the training session
has finished. Don’t bother about rewinding a video or putting equipment
or visuals away. You owe your time to your participants.
Visuals should enhance your performance rather than replace it
Your visuals should not take center stage, but they should help to explain or
clarify the concepts you are presenting.
 Visuals should become an extension of yourself as you use them to
explain the content of your presentations.
 Visuals are tied together with a common element, for example, a
graphic, a color, or a sketch.
You’re prepared for an emergency
Emergencies that occur during the presentation don’t have to be a complete
disaster. These may help to reduce the effect on your participants:
 Have an extra bulb, adaptor plug, marking pens.
 Know how to change the bulb.
 Know how or where to obtain an extension cord.
 Have an alternative plan if the electricity fails.
 Call a break as you address the emergency.
And finally, in the words of that famous trainer, Anonymous: “Keep it simple,
keep it simple, keep it simple.”
Guidelines for using specific 
media and visuals
You have read some general tips to ensure success with using the media and
visuals. How about a few guidelines for each specific media type?
192
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

LCD projector guidelines
Keep the limited flexibility in mind when using LCD-projected PowerPoint.
It may be difficult to get participants involved in the visuals. Use other media
to create and display their ideas. To design PowerPoint slides that incorpo-
rate effective techniques, return to Chapter 5. In addition, try some of these
guidelines:
 Plan ahead to know where you will be standing.
 E-mail the presentation to yourself as a backup. 
 Some LCD projectors will identify the lifespan of the bulb.
 Focus and set up before the training begins; some LCD machines may
not be compatible with all computers.
 Mark the projection table placement with masking tape on the floor in
case you need to move it.
 Use a wireless advance control and try it out ahead; have extra batteries
available.
 Turn off lights immediately in front of the screen but keep them on in the
rest of the room.
 If the projector has an automatic keystoning setting, don’t increase the
projection angle over 30 degrees.
 Know the password for the computer you will use.
 Ensure that the computer uses an appropriate screen saver.
 Turn off instant messenger, Outlook, and other communication tools
loaded on the computer.
 Ensure that both machines have proper ventilation around them.
 Ensure that the LCD has the right number of lumens of light for the size
of the room.
 Prepare your participants for what they should be learning, seeing.
 Allow an average of 10 to 20 seconds of reading time per slide. Viewers’
eyes should have time to move over the entire visual but not become
“fixed” on it. Interject your comments accordingly; otherwise, hypnosis
may set in.
 Speak to the participants, NOT to the screen.
Film, DVD, and video guidelines
Use video judiciously. Take care that if you include a film clip that it uses the
right amount of time. Also, always preview the tape before showing it in your
session. 
193
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

 Set up the machine before your presentation.
 Practice setting the sound and dimming lights.
 Cue the tape and have it ready to play.
 Check the sound.
 Never leave videos, CDs, or DVDs in a hot car.
 Before playing, provide an introduction that tells why you’re showing
the tape.
Trainers sometimes encounter participants who claim they cannot relate to
a setting or video because it is not the same occupational setting as the one
they are in. Defuse this issue in your introduction by stating up front that
they will see a setting that is different from theirs, but it should not make a
difference because the goal is to learn a technique that is transferable to any
setting.
 Show only the portion that you must to make the point; provide a brief
explanation about what happens up to this point.
 Before you show the tape, tell participants what to do during the view-
ing, for example, take notes, look for a specific behavior.
 Don’t turn off the lights if people will be taking notes.
 Follow the viewing with at least one question to get participants quickly
involved again.
 Allow for discussion and highlight key points.
 Ensure that participants are clear about the objectives of the film and
what they should have learned.
 Rewind the video after the training has been completed; you owe your
time to your participants.
If you’re actually filming or videotaping, remember these guidelines for a
smoother training session:
 Test the camera beforehand; learn zoom, turning on/off, tripod adjust-
ment, and other techniques.
 Determine whether you will need an additional person to assist with the
taping.
 Have extra videotapes on hand.
 Be prepared for cameras that automatically shut off after a time period.
 Adjust the tripod to the appropriate height.
 Do a microphone check beforehand.
 Test the VCR and monitor beforehand.
194
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Overhead transparency guidelines
Overheads may not be the most-cutting edge technology, but they continue
to be the most versatile and flexible when you need to address unanticipated
participant needs.
 Maintain eye contact with audience; there is no need to look at the
screen.
 Number the transparencies for easy ordering each time.
 Turn the projector off between transparencies.
To avoid the constant on/off clicking sound, you may cover the light
source with cardstock.
 Project large images.
 Don’t block your visual.
 Prevent keystone distortion by tilting the screen forward at the top.
 Use a pen or small pointer to draw attention to a specific point or to
assist your learners to follow the content.
Use a swizzle stick or plastic cocktail pick to create a unique and color-
ful pointer. Take care that you don’t put your hand over the light source.
The image of your large hand will be a big distraction.
 Use the reveal technique to control how much your participants see at
one time.
Use cardstock in a bright color and place it under the transparency. Use
a bright color so that you can find it on your table of supplies. Place it
under the transparency so that you can see the next point and prepare
to discuss it.
 Record participants’ comments on the transparencies to make your
transparencies living documents and to increase participation.
 If you have written on the transparency with markers, remove all traces
before putting them away. Even water-based markers leave a stain if left
too long.
 If ceiling lights shine directly on the screen, dim those nearest the screen
for a sharper contrast.
 Do not three-hole punch your transparencies to place in a binder; the
holes will show up on the screen.
 Put transparencies in transparency frames after they are designed and
for storage; frames keep them flat and protect them until the next train-
ing session.
Purchase protectors or frames specifically designed for transparencies.
Page protectors do not provide as clear an image.
195
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

Flipchart guidelines
Flipcharts may sit patiently waiting in the corner of a training room. When you
pull them out, however, be prepared with these guidelines to look like a pro.
 Charts for displaying information should be to your dominant side; charts
for writing on should be to your nondominant side (this ensures that your
back is to the fewest participants when you’re writing on the chart).
 Write on every other page so that participants cannot read through to
the next page; this also provides a page to absorb pen marks that may
bleed through.
 Select and stage the color of markers you will use before the session.
Mr. Sketch makes the best markers for flipcharts. They do not bleed
through the paper, are washable (even out of your clothes), and as a
bonus they smell great!
 Printed letters should be 1 to 3 inches high.
 Use some of the new flipchart stickers and fluorescent tape to highlight
words, add borders, or use for emphasis in other ways.
 Pencil small cues in the margin.
 Bend the lower corners (two pages together if you have written on every
other page) closest to where you will stand so that you can reach down
without looking to turn a page.
 Practice rolling the pages over to the back of the easel.
 Use sticky-back tabs to locate specific information on predesigned charts.
 Don’t try to talk, write, and spell at the same time.
 After writing, pause and turn toward your participants before you begin
to speak.
 Clear the visual: Tell participants what is on the entire page in one suc-
cinct statement before discussion on each individual point. This will
help them stay focused and with you as you explain the content.
 Stand beside the chart.
 Talk to your participants, not to the chart, using a touch, turn, tell
process.
 Lined pads are available for those whose writing strays from horizontal.
 Put the marker down when you’re not writing.
 Turn pages out of sight when they are no longer pertinent.
 When appropriate, tear off sheets and hang them on the walls with
masking tape.
196
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Place two-inch strips of masking tape on the back side of the easel to use
to tape pages to the wall.
Plan where and how you will hang your charts. Hang them so they can
be read left to right. Use the same color marker for charts that belong
together.
Hang your charts in a straight vertical line — not going uphill, or down-
hill. To do this, the first one must be precisely vertical and perpendicular
to the floor so that you can use its edge as your guide as you hang the
rest. You can accomplish this in at least four ways. First prepare by
attaching tape to the top of the chart.
 If wallpaper covers the wall, find the seam and align it.
 If there is a pattern on the wall, use that as a cue.
 If you have time, position two pieces of transparent tape, equal dis-
tance from the floor, to serve as a guide.
 When all else fails, grasp the chart with both hands equal distance
from the top of the page, stand with your feet flat on the floor and
reach the same height with both hands, and attach it.
To complete the task, step back and eyeball the first chart. Make any
adjustments. With a little practice you will be able to hang them perpen-
dicular without any guide at all.
Blackboard, whiteboard, electronic whiteboard guidelines
Though you may not use them too often, follow this guidance to improve
their effectiveness.
 Be absolutely certain that you’re using the correct marker; permanent
markers or inappropriate markers spell disaster.
 Avoid dark clothing if you know you will use a blackboard; chalk dust
will soon find its way to your clothes.
 Star, box, or circle items for emphasis.
 Use the darkest marker if you intend to copy from an electronic white-
board; even red doesn’t copy well.
Use this idea if you do not spell very well and you find yourself writing in
front of groups. When a participant uses a word that I cannot spell, I print a
dozen arbitrary letters in the corner of the board or flipchart, making sure
they do NOT spell anything. I then turn to the audience and say, “I am not a
very good speller. So if you see that I have forgotten a letter in a word, please
just take it from the pile of letters and insert it where it belongs. Thank you.”
197
Chapter 10: Mastering Media and Other Visuals

Prop guidelines
Props are used whenever possible to make a point or to give participants
hands-on practice. A few tips will make their use easier.
 Keep props out of sight until you’re ready to have participants interact
with them.
 Stretch, be creative, find the link that allows a prop to be a metaphor for
key points in your training.
 Have them readily available for use and touch during breaks.
Take a trip to your local dollar or hardware store to find props and workshop
themes that will help your participants learn faster and retain longer than
any other media or tool you can use.
Hot Tips for a Cool Ending
The tips listed here are things I have picked up from the best trainer of all,
experience. They will not make or break your session. Some are so logical and
practical you will wonder why someone else hasn’t published them before.
 Practice tearing flipchart pages off the pack with razor-sharp precision.
Many trainers yank them off hard or pull them up against the cardboard
strip. Both techniques result in ragged edges. Instead, start the chart
gently at the perforated tear line, and then continue pulling the page
straight down. It’s like the “Ole!” cape motion of a bullfighter! You’ll have
a perfect rip nearly every time. 
 If you want to get a head start on your perfect flipchart tear, you may rip
the perforation about an inch or two before your session starts. That
way you will have a “perfect” start to each page.
 When you’re given a flipchart that has lots of ragged edges at the top
where trainers did not know how to tear off the charts, simply flip the
first page to the back to cover all the rough tears.
 Masking tape can remove certain kinds of paint from walls. If you’re
uncertain, test the wall in an inconspicuous place.
 Blue painters’ tape works better than masking tape; it holds the paper in
place and is safe for all surfaces.
198
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 When conducting a training session at a hotel, be sure to ask whether
your room will be used that evening for another group. If it is, recognize
that when you return in the morning your visuals and equipment will be
moved, perhaps even discarded.
 If you have a flipchart at the training site, create a “welcome to the train-
ing” page.
 If flipchart pages fall off the wall, you often can remedy by putting more
tape on the wall, not more on the paper chart. 
 You can pre-position flipcharts on the wall. Fold the bottom of the chart
up to the top to cover the information until you want it. Use masking
tape to make a tab in the center of the chart. When you’re ready, pull the
masking tape tab down to reveal the information on the chart.
 All markers are not created equal. Bring your own; do not depend on
someone else’s markers.
 Cap your markers as soon as you’re finished writing; don’t allow them to
lay around without caps and dry out.
 Purchase only water-based markers. They won’t bleed through paper,
and if you drop markers on your clothes, the color washes out.
 Use a variety of bullets in front of lists. One that I like to use is an empty
shadowed box. As the class finishes discussing each item, I fill in the box
or add a checkmark.
 Wash the glass on your overhead projector and the cover of the light
source for all your projectors. You may be surprised at how few trainers
clean their equipment.
 Personalize visuals by adding the company’s logo. Add yours if you’re an
independent trainer, too. You can even trace one on flipcharts.
 Ensure that your visuals are the highest quality possible.
If you must apologize for any of your visuals, get rid of them.
 Most important: Have a backup plan. The greatest cause of problems in
training sessions is something to do with the media and/or visuals. Have
a backup plan.
Use pictures or charts instead of words whenever possible. Will Rogers
stated, “People’s minds are changed through observation and not through
argument.”

Flipchart graphics
Adding graphics to your flipchart assists visual
learners, maintains focus, and adds color and
fun to the session. The icons in this sidebar get
you started replacing words with graphics.
Practice with these icons, and then add your
own special touch to these or create your own.
 A star person indicates peo-
ple and can show connections
between individuals or groups
and ideas.
 Arrows show movement and
can indicate progress or con-
nections. Two arrows pointing at
each other may depict conflict.
 Light bulbs are used to highlight
good ideas.
 Thought clouds can refer to
reviews or to revisiting a con-
cept. Clouds without the thought
bubbles can suggest an idea or
vision.
 A target can signify a goal or
objective.
 Dollar signs mean money, and 
a ribbon can suggest a prize 
or the best of what has been 
discussed.
 A clock can show time for com-
pleting a project or the next
steps.

Training with Style
In This Chapter
 Identifying training styles
 Understanding group dynamics
 Adding energy and excitement to your training
 Putting it all together to train with style
C
hapters 1 through 10 focus on the basics of the training and workplace
learning profession: understanding adult-learning theory, understanding
the steps of the training cycle, practicing good presentation skills, and select-
ing and using audiovisuals.
This chapter goes beyond the basics to an intermediate level of training skills
and knowledge. It covers several topics to ensure that you’re a skilled profes-
sional trainer. It presents four training styles so that you can identify your
style and use your strengths to the best advantage for each session. This
chapter also explores group dynamics and what it takes to create an energiz-
ing and exciting environment.
Understanding Your Training
Style Strengths
Every trainer brings a unique set of strengths to a training session. The effec-
tive trainer recognizes these strengths and builds off of them. To do this, it is
helpful to have an understanding of the styles and the behaviors that make
up the model. 
The more you know about yourself and your training style, the better trainer
you will be.

 When you know your own style, you recognize your weaknesses and can
make an effort to improve them.
 Knowing other training styles helps you appreciate aspects of training
that are important to all participants, thus getting into everyone’s learn-
ing comfort zone.
 The more you know about training styles, the better role model you are
for others.
Even though everyone exhibits characteristics from all style types, everyone
has preferences that are ours alone. Ideally, a trainer is balanced among all
four styles. However, having a perfect balance is almost nonexistent. Equally
as good as a balance is the trainer who is flexible enough to fulfill all roles.
Building the training style model
All trainers have personal preferences that are based on who they are as 
individuals. It would be a boring world if everyone was the same, whether in
food preferences or communication styles. Training style is the same, and
some training styles appeal to some learners more than others. Professional
trainers adapt their training style to meet the needs of everyone in the class-
room. 
 The training style foundation: The trainer style model is based on four
dimensions of training: content, process, task, and people. These dimen-
sions can be placed on two scales that, when combined, create a grid
displaying four styles. 
 Content/process continuum: Trainers may be either content or process
focused, so the horizontal scale is a continuum with content at the left
end of the scale and process to the right end of the scale, as presented
in Figure 11-1. Each trainer may be anywhere along the continuum,
depending on his or her preference.
The content is the purpose of the learning experience. A trainer who is
more interested in ensuring that the information contained in the course
is delivered accurately to the participants is content focused. Trainers
work hard at ensuring that content is accurate and that everything has
been put before the learner. A trainer who prefers content over process
may try to squeeze everything in. A trainer who prefers this end of the
continuum may say such things as “information you’ll need” and “other
resources available include.”
Process is the overall flow of a training program and the flow of events
within the program. Process includes such activities as facilitating dis-
cussion, forming small groups, and moving from one topic to another. A
trainer who prefers process over content may forsake content to ensure
202

a great experience for participants. A trainer who prefers this end of
the continuum may say such things as “that discussion went well” and
“everything is going smoothly.”
Which is better? Neither! You need both a content and a process focus in
order to have a successful training experience. 
 Task/people continuum: The vertical scale is a continuum with task at
the top and people at the bottom, as presented in Figure 11-1. Again,
trainers may be anywhere along this continuum depending on their pref-
erences.

Chapter 11: Training with Style

The task dimension focuses on everything a trainer needs to do to manage
a learning environment. The tasks may enable learning such as setting up
a simulation, or they may be purely administrative such as record keep-
ing. They may include setup tasks such as rearranging the tables, creating
the schedule, and placing materials on the tables. A trainer who prefers
tasks over people may forsake discussion or breaks to stay on schedule.
Trainers who have a preference for the task end of the continuum may say
such things as “I must complete this before” and “we’ll need to stop this
discussion and move on.” 
The people dimension refers primarily to the participants and may
include others related to the training program. Trainers focus on the
people when they do such things as modify the program to meet partici-
pant needs, encourage introductions and discussions, and schedule
timely breaks. A trainer who prefers people over task may not stay on
schedule very well and may need to shortchange some topics to “catch
up.” Trainers who have a preference for the people end of the contin-
uum may say such things as “what do you think about” and “you will
probably want to.”
Which is better? Neither! You need both a task and a people focus in
order to have a successful training experience. 
All four dimensions are important for a successful training session. How do
you see yourself? Perhaps you relate to one end of the continuum more than
the other. Perhaps you believe you are balanced between the two ends. You
probably demonstrate characteristics at both ends of the continuum. It
simply means that you are able to do all of it. 
Think instead about what you “prefer” to do — those things that come natu-
rally to you. This is important because when you’re pressed for time or are
under stress, you tend to do what comes naturally. It is at these times that
trainers need to push themselves to remember to do it all. Most successful
trainers can move easily along the continuum depending on the situation. Yet
each person does have a preferred spot on the continuum when no one is
asking you to be anything but who you are naturally. Spot yourself and your
preferences on each of the two continuums.
Exploring the four training styles
When you superimpose one continuum over the other, you create a grid that
displays four different training styles as pictured in Figure 11-2. When you
combine the content end of the horizontal scale with the task end of the ver-
tical scale, you have a trainer who enjoys delivering content, is organized,
and is in control. I call this training style the presenting style.
204
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

When you combine the process end of the horizontal scale with the task end
of the vertical scale, you have a trainer who states clear expectations, is sys-
tematic in presentations, and uses a logical approach. I call this training style
the guiding style.
When you combine the process end of the horizontal scale with the people
end of the vertical scale, you have a trainer who is generally a great listener,
encourages discussion among participants, and confirms and reinforces par-
ticipants. I call this training style the facilitating style.

Chapter 11: Training with Style

When you combine the content end of the horizontal scale with the people end
of the vertical scale, you have a trainer who is motivating, directs participants
to the answers, but does not tell them straight out, and who cheers partici-
pants on to bigger and greater things. I call this training style the coaching style.
Now, before you start reading your personal definitions into the labels for each
of these training styles, I am going to caution you to relax. None, let me repeat,
none of the training styles is any better than any of the others. This information
is only to help you understand your personal preferences so that you know
which areas are your strengths and which areas you need to improve.
In the following bullets, you can explore some of the additional strengths of
each of the styles. Also consider cautions for each of the four styles. The cau-
tions are areas that each style needs to be aware of, especially during times
of stress.
Presenting style strengths:
 Delivers interesting presentations
 Enjoys being in front of a group
 Is a positive center of influence
 Is organized and in control
 Is comfortable delivering information
 Is engaging, quick-thinking
Presenting style cautions:
 May not enable or allow participants’ self-discovery
 May have to deal with own ego
 May be manipulative or dominating

Does one size fit all in training?
by Jean Barbazette
One of the difficult issues trainers and course
designers face is to match a lesson to the needs
of the learners. Homogeneous audiences make
a trainer’s task of design and facilitation an
easier one. When learners have the same level
of experience, interest, and past training, one
lesson fits the needs of all the learners. So,
what’s the best way to design a training session
for a diverse audience?
The answer: Design all training using an expe-
riential learning model. Several models with dif-
fering numbers of steps have been offered to
trainers over many years to teach through sim-
ulations. These models include
1. Setting up the learning activity
2. Conducting the learning activity
3. Asking learners to share and interpret their
reactions to the activity
4. Identifying what was learned through the
activity
5. Planning how to use what was learned
An experiential learning model helps all learn-
ers begin from where they are and grow from a
shared experience. Because experiential learn-
ing actively involves the learner, it is possible to
use the same activity with a diverse audience.
Granted, some learners will get more out of an
activity than others.
Trainers need a range of skills to facilitate each
step of the experiential learning model. In Step
1, setting up the learning activity, adult learners
become motivated when they understand the
benefits or importance of the activity to them-
selves and their work. To be successful, set up
the activity so learners understand what they
are going to do and why they are going to do it.
A trainer needs to be directive by giving instruc-
tions and ground rules for how the learning
activity is to be conducted. Setups may also
include elements such as the following:
 Tell participants about the purpose of the
learning activity. 
 Divide participants into groups and assign
roles. 
 Provide ground rules. 
 Explain what the participants are going
to do. 
 Tell participants why they are doing the
activity without giving away what they will
“discover” as a result of engaging in the
activity.
In Step 2, a learning activity will be successful
when adult learners are involved as much as
possible. It is also appropriate to consider how
the activity will appeal to the senses of sight,
hearing, and touch. This step includes any
learning activity, including lecture, discussion,
case study, role play, simulation or game, inven-
tory, and independent study and/or reading.
Depending on the activity selected for Step 2,
the trainer’s style can be anywhere on a contin-
uum from presenting to facilitating.
In Step 3, learners share their reactions to the
activity by identifying what happened to them
and to others as well as how their own behav-
ior affected others. Often, questions such as
these are asked:
 “What was your partner’s reaction when
you did . . . ?”
 “What helped or hindered your progress?” 
 “Summarize the key points from the lecture,
role-playing activity, or case study.”
Learners in diverse groups learn different things
from the same activity. The trainer’s role in this
step is to facilitate a discussion and ask the

No one style is any better than another, so there is no reason to think that you
would want to change your style. It is just who you are, with your strengths
and areas that you need to attend to more than others. 
Using your training style
Even though you have preferences, that is not an excuse for not improving the
areas that need to be improved. All of the dimensions are defined by skills —
skills that you can master and abilities that you can acquire.
Take time right now to think about your training style. What are your prefer-
ences? Are you balanced in your use of all four dimensions? Or do you have
strong preferences? What are your strengths? What areas need improving?
What insights have you gained by thinking through this content? What can
you do differently as a result of the knowledge you have learned?
209
Chapter 11: Training with Style
learners what happened to them (not what was
learned) during the activity.
During Step 4, the trainer again uses a facilita-
tive role and helps learners discover the con-
cept or idea underlying the activity. This is the
“So, what did I learn?” step. Questions that
develop concepts may include “What did you
learn about how to conduct an interview?
Discipline a subordinate? Teach a new job?”
and so on.” 
If this step is left out, learning will be incom-
plete. Certainly, participants will have been
entertained by the training activity, but they may
not be able to apply new learning to similar sit-
uations outside the classroom. Indeed, it is only
when concepts are inferred from an activity that
adult learners are ready and able to apply them
to future situations. Diverse learners can learn
different things from the same activity. The
trainer’s role as a facilitator is to be sure each
learner takes away something of value from the
activity.
During Step 5, the trainer continues in a facili-
tative style. This is the “So, what now?” step.
During this process, learners are asked to use
and apply new information learned from the
activity to their own situations. This step often
involves an action question such as “How will
you use this questioning technique the next time
a subordinate asks you for a favor?” or “In what
situations would you be more effective if you
used this technique?” Like the preceding four
steps, if this step is left out, then learners may
not be able to discern the relationship between
the learning activity and their job (or situation)
and may not be able to see how what was
learned can be useful to them in the future.
Diverse learners definitely take something dif-
ferent from the lesson because different jobs
require different applications. The trainer’s role
is to be sure enough questions are discussed so
application of the concept is possible for all
learners.
So does one size fit all in training? A trainer can
use the same activity for diverse learners.
A skillful trainer uses a variety of styles — 
presenting, guiding, coaching, and facilitating —
to be sure all learners find value in the same
activity. 

Jean Barbazette is one of the few people who addresses training styles in an
orderly way. She developed one of the first trainer style inventories in 1996.
Although her model is different from the one presented in this book, her phi-
losophy is similar, as presented by her in the “Does one size fit all in training?”
sidebar. Jean is president of The Training Clinic, a train-the-trainer company in
Seal Beach, California. She has designed and presented train-the-trainer work-
shops since 1977. The focus of her work in training and development has been
to make training programs practical, useful, and concrete. She is also the author
of The Trainer’s Support Handbook: A Guide to Managing the Administrative
Details of Training and Instant Case Studies: How to Design, Adapt, and Use Case
Studies in Training. See the “Does one size fit all in training?” sidebar for more
information from Jean.
Gauging Group Dynamics
Group dynamics develop when people interact with one another. The study of
group dynamics is a more complex undertaking than space allows me to discuss
here. Yet understanding group dynamics is important so that you are aware
of why your participants are acting the way they are and how it may affect
other participants and ultimately your training session. Therefore, I present
here a general overview of the kinds of things that can affect group dynamics.
This section barely scratches the surface of what many know about the topic.
Numerous elements can affect group dynamics, such as the composition of
the group, the atmosphere, the norms under which the individuals operate,
the values of the individuals and the group, the communication and partici-
pation among the group, the roles that participants play, and the power and
influence that exists and is exuded within the group. The following sections
examine some of these.
Composition
Composition refers to a number of things. The size of the group may have more
effect on team dynamics than anything else. If the group is too large, you may
have difficulty in keeping everyone’s attention and balancing participation.
Consider the reasons participants are attending the training. Very different
dynamics occur when participants believe that they have a choice about
attending the training than if they believe they were sent against their will. 
The feelings participants have about each other is another composition aspect
that can affect the group dynamics. Do they like the other people in the train-
ing session? Do all the departments respect each other? Previous as well as
current work relationships with each other can affect the dynamics as well.

The formation of subgroups affects group dynamics, too. Consider this as
you prepare for your session. And you may prepare for the exact opposite,
depending upon the situation. For example, if you are teaching team skills,
you may want subgroups to form. In that case, you can create opportunities
to strengthen these teams. At other times, you may need to find ways to
break up cliques and get the already formed subgroups to split up and work
with other participants.
Atmosphere
Begin to examine the dynamics caused by the atmosphere by looking toward
the physical setting. Is the room spacious? too spacious? crowded? Is the
lighting bright? dim? natural? Are the tables spacious? crowded? Are the
chairs comfortable? hard? Is the temperature comfortable? too hot? too cold?
Can you control it? It doesn’t matter how great your training session is. If the
participants are not comfortable, I guarantee it will affect group dynamics
negatively.
How formal is the training session? Is the timeline flexible enough to accom-
modate participants’ needs and requests? If it isn’t, you may influence group
dynamics in a positive way by determining how you can build in time for
unique participant needs. 
The level of interest participants have in the subject affect group dynamics.
The amount of laughter you hear is an indicator of how much fun partici-
pants are having. Paired with how interested participants are in the content,
both affect the dynamics. 
How congenial people are to each other, how participants express them-
selves, and how well they accept others and the session are other aspects of
the atmosphere that may have either a negative or positive effect on group
dynamics.
Norms
When people think about group dynamics, they often think first of norms.
Norms are what people have grown to expect of each other and the rest of the
group. Included in norms are attendance and punctuality expectations. Is it
common to show up five or ten minutes late and still be counted as timely?
Is that true for some of the group or all members of the group? Is everyone
expected to attend fully? How about phone calls? Can participants leave to
return messages? Each of these affects group dynamics — especially if every-
one in the session operates under a different set of norms.
211
Chapter 11: Training with Style

The amount and type of participation that is acceptable is a part of the orga-
nizational norms. Trainers sometimes stretch individuals, encouraging them
to be more participative than they normally would be. That is generally seen
as good. Take care that you do not stretch them too much. For example, don’t
expect engineers to enjoy role plays. This is one of the reasons to find out all
you can about participants before the training session.
The topics of the training session may affect the group dynamics, but interest-
ingly, the topics that are avoided may also affect the group dynamics. If partici-
pants are listening to content that they believe is good but not displayed within
the organization, they may feel the training is a sham. Having an opportunity to
express what they are thinking may help the group dynamics.
The norms that individuals operate under when working with the rest of the
group are also important. For example, do they treat each other with respect?
Do they cooperate during tasks? Are some more competitive than others? Is
information shared willingly or withheld? Each of these affects the small-
group exercises in the training session.
Values
The values that individuals bring to the session affect the group dynamics.
Ideally, individual, group, and organizational values are the same. When this
is not true, however, it can affect the interaction negatively. You may see
some people stop interacting if certain beliefs are brought up. The direction
the group wants to take as a result of differences in values can be a positive
experience. In most cases, it is wise to allow a discussion of the differences to
take place. Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to bring closure to these
discussions.
Another way values can affect the dynamics of a group is if hidden agendas
exist in the group. It may take a while, but, generally, hidden agendas are
uncovered by the behaviors that are observed or the comments that are
made. By the way, hidden agendas do not always need to represent a “bad”
objective. However, a lack of openness may lead to distrust among the group.
Communication and participation
As a trainer, you have a role in displaying good communication and encouraging
participation. Participants bring their skills and beliefs into the training session,
and this affects the group dynamics. The degree to which some participants
want to be involved may be different from others. This may affect large-group
discussions as well as small-group activities. The communication and partici-
pation aspect of group dynamics is one area over which the trainer has the
most control.
212
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Group dynamics are affected by many things that you do as a trainer. For
example, how you handle disagreements and conflicts is observed by partici-
pants. The factors that contribute to the misunderstanding also affect group
dynamics. How you address challenges and how you deal with interruptions
affect the level of trust and respect participants have for you.
Participants observe how silent members are treated. Are they brought into
the discussion slowly, respecting their personal needs? Or are they forced to
participate before they are comfortable? Or are they ignored?
Listening skills of both the trainer and the participants affect the group dynam-
ics. Participants may have a hard time respecting a trainer who is not a good
listener.
Roles
The roles participants play affect the team dynamics. Roles are frequently
divided into task and maintenance behaviors. Individuals play these roles
naturally.
 Task roles are those things that individuals do to get the job completed.
Task roles supply the information, ideas, and energy necessary for the
group to accomplish its objectives. These roles get things started and
may include asking for information or opinions, clarifying comments,
sharing facts or ideas, or suggesting solutions or methods. Task roles
may also help to organize by coordinating or clarifying relationships,
comparing concepts, defining positions, or summarizing what has hap-
pened. Task roles may also focus on action-type events by offering sug-
gestions, prodding the group to take action, or simply keeping the group
on task.
 Maintenance roles are behaviors that are completed that ensure a positive
atmosphere. Maintenance roles establish and maintain interpersonal
relationships and a pleasant atmosphere. They are generally focused
on people and the atmosphere. Individuals may play roles to mediate
differences or referee disagreements. These roles include searching for
common elements in conflicts or offering a compromise. Maintenance
roles also include motivators who offer praise of and support to others.
Maintenance roles include finding the humor in a situation and bringing
in participants who otherwise may not speak. Maintenance roles encour-
age participation, build trust, and relieve tension in a group.
Power and influence
Power and influence are potentially one of the most problematic areas of group
dynamics to a trainer. Power is often described as coming from three sources:
213
Chapter 11: Training with Style

positional power, informational power, or charismatic power. Each of these
three has the potential to affect group dynamics — either positively or nega-
tively. Individuals do not like to feel powerless. Therefore, how individuals use
power determines how it affects the dynamics of the group. Using power to
lead positively or to contribute appropriately will enhance group dynamics.
On the other hand, flaunting power or using it negatively can be destructive.
Individuals who have reporting relationships are often a dilemma for trainers.
It may be uncomfortable for a participant to be in a session with the boss
present. The subordinate may not feel comfortable contributing during the
session.
Rivalry between departments or individuals may also cause group dynamics
problems for a trainer. If individuals do not get along outside a training ses-
sion, the situation can be exacerbated by forcing them to sit in the same
room and interact during a training session.
Many things can affect group dynamics during a training session. A good
trainer learns as much as possible about the participants and prepares for
anything that may cause a disruption. On the positive side, a trainer’s knowl-
edge of the participants may also be used to enhance the training session. 
Trainers need to be proactive about managing groups and the group dynamics.
Should subgroups remain the same for key projects? Or is it better if they
change? How do you determine whether the large group is mixing and mingling
enough? What do you do to include everyone but not impose on those who
prefer to participate by listening? What do you do when you sense tension?
How do you deal with someone who may be using power inappropriately? Each
of these affects group dynamics and how you address each affects it also. 
This section alerts you to some of the most common aspects of group
dynamics. Awareness is the first step: Observe your participants. When you
address various aspects, be sure to note what happens. Later, determine why.
You may even want to discuss what occurred with another trainer. People
being who they are, it is impossible to identify every situation you may
encounter. However, your experiences and what you learn from them will
equip you to handle future group-dynamics situations.
Creating an Energizing, Exciting,
Encouraging Environment
You always want to establish an environment that’s conducive to learning.
However, there are times (most times) when you want to go beyond the
basics to create an energizing or exciting and encouraging environment. How
do you do that? You can add energy and excitement to a training session with
a little extra planning. Here are some suggestions.
214
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Coloring outside the lines
Remember that old joke “What’s black and white and red all over?” As I recall
there were a couple of right answers: a newspaper and an embarrassed zebra.
As a trainer, you need to ensure that you’re looking outside the lines — the
black-and-white lines — of training and encouraging the colorful, creative
world of training. 
This book touches on the topic of color a couple of times when I explore media
and visuals. One of the advantages of using visuals is that you can add color.
However, you can add color in other ways as well. 
If you experiment with various colors on visuals, check them out from the
back of the room to ensure readability.
Color affects everyone, and each color is associated with specific emotions.
Marketing folks have depended on color for years to encourage you to pur-
chase one product over another. Trainers can use color to
 Excite and stimulate participants’ senses
 Encourage participants to get involved in activities
 Energize participants to learn and apply the knowledge and skills they
learn
Consider some of the emotions associated with specific colors, as shown in
Table 11-1.
Table 11-1
Color Associations
Color
Using Color to Evoke Emotions and Energize
Red
Red says, “Pay attention!” It evokes power, anger, achieve-
ment, excitement, and intensity. It tells us to stop. It may send a
negative message due to financial shortages. Red should be
reserved for highlighting, circling hot spots, or trouble. It can
indicate tension or stressful areas also.
Yellow
Evokes happiness, cheerfulness, and warmth. While it can be
mellow and indicate optimism, it can also suggest caution.
Although it stimulates thinking, it is impossible to see on its own,
so use it to fill within the lines. Use it to find ideas and to support
creativity.

Table 11-1 (continued)
Color
Using Color to Evoke Emotions and Energize
Blue
Blue creates a feeling of reliability, trust, maturity, authority,
peace, and tranquility. Dark blue projects a masculine image,
while light blue projects youth. Use blue early in a session to
establish trust.
Green
Indicates productivity, growth, youth, and health. Instills a posi-
tive image and forward motion, “go.” Suggests money or pros-
perity. Use green branches on a tree to suggest strength or
growth. Light green is energizing, but dark green is easier to
read. Use it when reaching consensus or finding compromises.
Orange
Stimulates energy, enthusiasm, and positive thinking. This lively
color works best for highlighting, but it may be difficult to read
in rooms with fluorescent lighting. Use to highlight a subject or
create connections.
Purple
Projects assertiveness, boldness, passion, and power. May be
used to signify royalty, richness, or spirituality. Works well with
other colors and stimulates ideas during brainstorming.
White
Usually indicates cleanliness, honesty, innocence, or goodness.
White space provides visual rest. Use white space to assist
with clarity and order.
Black
Creates feelings of independence and solidarity. As opposed to
red, suggests financial solvency. Has a serious side by repre-
senting death, somberness, or gravity of a situation. Easiest of
all colors to read by everyone. Usually highlight with a bright
color. Because it means finality, it is not the best color to use
when brainstorming.
Brown
Indicates strength, support, solidly earthy, and a lack of superi-
ority. It may affect some folks negatively. This is an easy-to-read
color but may be depressing or drab on its own.
Pink
Light pink indicates femininity and fun. It is upbeat and youthful.
Bright pink creates excitement and passion. Combines well with
other colors and may be a good wake-up color after lunch.
Gold/silver
These prestigious hues project elegance and an image of
status. May also suggest riches.
So how can you use color in your training? Here are a few ways I add color:
 Place brightly colored sticky notes in front of participants, so that the
notes are available for them to jot a note or to mark something in their
participant materials.
216
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Use colored paper for specific activities. For example, I have a page of
creativity techniques that has a light bulb in the background that I copy
on bright yellow paper. In another training session, I conduct a killer-
phrases exercise, where the participants list killer phrases on red paper
and end up wadding up their pages and throwing them. 
 Place a variety of brightly colored sheets of paper in the center of tables
for use with small-group activities that require blank paper.
 Place crayons or colored pencils on the tables and ask participants to
complete certain activities using them. A favorite is to use them to deco-
rate their name tents.
 Hang posters that are related to your training session around the room.
They may also be posters that encourage thinking positively, that deliver
a message, or provide a quote.
 When voting on positive and/or negative issues, you can use sticky flags
on a wall poster. For example, use a green flag to vote for the character-
istic that our team is best at and a red flag to vote for the characteristic
that our team needs to improve the most.
 Instead of dark on light, surprise your participants and have them write
light on dark. Use white, silver, or gold marking pens and dark paper in
red, green, and even navy blue. These items are easy to find in your local
office supply store.
Don’t use colors willy-nilly. Think through how you will use them. For exam-
ple, colors can be a great way to transition from one module to another. Use
highlighting to assist learners to note the key areas. Think about which color
combinations work best. Use brighter colors to infuse energy after lunch.
Energizing the group
Many of the ideas discussed in this book energize participants: 
 Obtaining participation
 Conducting learner-centered activities
 Varying activities
 Creating an active learning environment
 Celebrating success
 Being enthusiastic yourself
All of these are important, but sometimes you need just a bit more. If you see
energy waning or enthusiasm wavering, it may be time to move people around
the room in the form of an energizer.
217
Chapter 11: Training with Style

Purpose of energizers
Energizers are used to change the mental and/or physical state of participants.
They may be used to change the pace of a program; for example, if the session
is bogged down in heavy discussion, you can use an energizer to speed up the
pace. Or the opposite, you may be able to use an energizer to provide quiet
personal reflection after an energetic group activity. Energizers are great to use
if participants have been sitting for a while and need to get up and move about.
Energizers are useful in many ways:
 Change the pace of the session
 Revive the energy of a group when it is lagging
 Create a transition from one topic to another
 Provide movement for kinesthetic learners
 Subtly break up subgroups that may have formed
 Give everyone a break from listening or sitting for a long period of time
Selecting energizers
Use the same common sense for selecting an energizer that you would when
selecting an icebreaker. Numerous books have been written about energizers,
and sometimes you can adjust an icebreaker to be an appropriate energizer.
 Consider the participants’ expectations.
 Consider the size of the group.
218
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 
How to determine whether you need an energizer
How do you know whether you need an ener-
gizer? There are lots of ways to tell. Try these for
starters.
 Participants agree with everything you say.
 Participants are sharing the scented 
markers.
 The most interested contributors are read-
ing ahead.
 The doodlers are creating works of art.
 Someone’s head thumps on the table, and
he or she does not awaken.
 Twenty-five percent of the group has left
the room and the rest are wiggling. 
 Seventy-five percent of the group is watch-
ing the fly circling the doughnuts.
 Magazines have been pulled out of back-
packs.
 Participants are entertained by their
watches’ second hand.
Yes, this is a tongue-in-cheek list. Don’t wait
until these things are happening. Attend to both
participants and the time so that you will sense
a break or an energizer is needed.

 Place the energizer at the appropriate time. 
 Have a clear purpose for selecting and scheduling the energizer.
 Initiate appropriate risk, ensuring that it is comfortable for everyone.
Energizer examples
So what does an energizer look like? This list displays the wide range.
 Participants find “their mate” based on anything from clothing to birth-
day to someone they don’t know. Once there, a task is assigned.
 Teams race to complete a puzzle, word game, or “test” related to the
content.
 Participants write one thing they have learned on a sheet of paper and
then turn it into a paper airplane. Fly the planes, and whomever it goes
to reads the item on the plane. 
 Hold a relay race or ball toss to review content.
 Participants select toys, tools, office supplies, or anything as a metaphor
related to the content or to their opinions about the session.
 Led by you, participants stretch, relax, deep breathe, or do “shake out”
exercises. 
 Use music: Sing rounds, make up songs, hand out kazoos, or hum.
For variation, hum using the sounds of various vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
 Sometimes, just a regular break serves as a great energizer.
Any of the preceding can be used to energize your group. Experiment with
various energizers. You will soon have your own repertoire of energizers. 
The Internet opens a whole world of energizers. Search for books from pub-
lishers such as American Society for Training and Development (ASTD),
Bowperson Publishing, Gulf Publishing, HRD Press, Lakewood Publications,
McGraw-Hill, and Pfeiffer/Jossey-Bass.
Let me entertrain you!
Humor can be the best thing for a training session — or the worst. Especially
if it falls flat. A few guidelines will help you to successfully interject humor
into your training session. My friend Jeanne builds humor into her presenta-
tions in a very natural way. She even calls herself an entertrainer and believes
that humor adds a great deal to training. What are some of the advantages of
adding humor to a training session?
 Can be used to get participants’ attention
 Keeps participants interested in content
219
Chapter 11: Training with Style

 Clarifies a point
 Ensures that key points are memorable
 Creates a relaxed atmosphere
 Builds a positive relationship between you and your participants
 Can ease the way through difficult content
Laughing while they learn
Notice that I have not mentioned telling jokes. Some people are good at
telling jokes; some are not. If you are in the second category, don’t bother.
Keep your humor natural and relevant to the content. Know your partici-
pants and what will be funny to them.
Being natural is best: Humor should fit naturally into the content. Relevance
is more important than humor. Do not tell a story or joke that is not related
to the content.
Keep a funny file. Build your own list of humorous stories. Keep a file with sto-
ries you may use, examples of things that happened to you, jokes, cartoons,
and funny quotes. Look for visuals as well. Your file will fill with experiences.
Keep it clean. I shouldn’t have to address this, but I will just to be certain.
Humor should not use offensive language. Race, religion, sex, stereotypes,
and politics are off limits.
What if you don’t get a laugh? You have two choices. You can ignore it and
move quickly into content, or you can try again with a quip such as “That’s
the last time I try out my material on a group of trainers” or “That’s the last
time I ask (name of one of the participants) for new material.” Sometimes,
you can pick up these one-liners watching stand-up comedians on television.
You may wish to check out Chapter 22 for ten ways to add humor to your
training. Many of the ideas are based on things that happen naturally in a
training session.
You ought to be in show business
Participants want to have fun. Now how can trainers create their own mater-
ial? Write your story in a conversational tone. Keep it short. Practice it out
loud. Try it out on someone or two. Rewrite it to clarify or simplify. Make sure
the words and timing are right. Be sure your punch line is clear, concise, and
of course — funny!
220
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Customize your joke for your audience. It is guaranteed to get a laugh! You
can customize it using names of the people in the organization, competitors
of the organization, or the location of your training. For example, the age-old
joke “I’m afraid to fly. It’s not the plane, it’s the drive to the airport,” can be
customized for the location. If you are in Washington, D.C., you could say,
“I’m afraid to fly. It’s not the plane, it’s the drive to Reagan National!”
Celebrating success
Remember when you were a kid and your family celebrated all those little
accomplishments, like the first time you rode a bike or taking a blue ribbon
at the science fair? Well, adults like to celebrate success, too. Another way to
create an energizing, exciting, enthusiastic environment is to celebrate partic-
ipants’ success.
Use rewards and reinforcement to celebrate success. Trainers use intrinsic
rewards such as thank yous, feedback on performance, and other verbal
recognition. Trainers also use tangible rewards, such as candy, gum, small
team prizes, and individual doodads. Or break out a special prize for every-
one (a big bag of candy-coated chocolate). 
Check out sources for inexpensive (some as low as a dime each) doodads.
Oriental Trading, at www.orientaltrading.com, is a favorite for toys, holi-
day items, puzzles, key chains, hats, and more things than you ever thought
existed. While it is fun to check its Web site, it’s even more fun to get on its
mailing list and have its monthly catalog delivered to your door!
Reinforce what participants learn throughout the training. You could try
some of these or make up your own.
 Participants write on flipchart pages posted on the wall. 
 Participants complete a crossword puzzle format or word search.
 Participants stand in a circle, toss a ball, and state one thing each
learned.
 Participants write a memo to their supervisors.
 Participants write a memo to themselves that the trainer mails later.
 Review key concepts using a game-show format such as Jeopardy!
All of these work to enhance and celebrate learning.
221
Chapter 11: Training with Style

Celebrate success at the end of the session as well. Certificates are an inex-
pensive reward, as is reenacting a graduation ceremony playing “Pomp and
Circumstance” or playing any engaging or celebratory tune that brings clo-
sure such as “Happy Trails” or “Goodbye, So Long, Farewell.” Bob Lucas,
trainer extraordinaire, likes to read from Dr. Seuss’s book, Oh, the Places
You’ll Go! The book’s message is about achievement and reaching goals.
If you use music in your training session, be sure to get copyright permission
from BMI or ASCAP.
Putting It All Together
Many concepts have been presented in this chapter. Can you really do it all?
Should you try? Well, that’s a trick question. You shouldn’t “try” to do any-
thing. You absorb this information and use it when appropriate. Everything
presented in this chapter sets a stage for you to add energy, excitement, and
encouragement to your sessions. Knowing your training style is the first step
to understanding what you will feel comfortable doing. 
Training with style means not only ensuring that you get the job done but
that you get the job done right — and ensure that you and the participants
enjoy everything along the way. You will learn more. Your participants will
learn more.
Or, as Plato stated, “You can discover more about a person in an hour of play
than in a year of conversation.”

Chapter 12
Addressing Problems:
What’s a Trainer to Do?
In This Chapter
 Preventing training problems 
 Dealing with unexpected training problems
 Managing disruptive participants
 Mastering your presentation anxiety
N
o matter how well prepared you are, no matter how critical the training
is, problems will occur. You simply cannot think of everything — but
that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try!
It’s not the disaster that matters; it’s how you manage the disaster that counts.
Your participants will be watching you as a role model, because they may
someday be in the same situation.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the COOL technique to manage any disas-
ters that may come your way. Staying COOL makes you appear to be the pro
that you are. Most trainers have experienced these problems at one time or
another — that’s how you know what works best! Your main problems are
likely to involve inadequate training facilities, disruptive participants, and
your own attack of nerves. What follows is a primer of problems, with the
tools you need to cut them off early without losing a beat.
Problems in the Classroom
A host of problems may occur during training. Just when you think you have
encountered almost anything that could happen, a new problem will be
tossed in your path. 

Problems with logistics
Logistics can create big headaches for trainers. Chapter 7 provides guidance
for how to prepare and prevent many logistical nightmares from occurring.
Here are a few others.
Rooms not conducive to training
You may find yourself conducting training in a room that was never intended
to be used for that purpose. You may be in a boardroom with a large table
and no room to divide into small groups. You may find a large pillar in the
center of the room. You may be in a room that is so filled with furniture there
is little space for your participants. You may even find that you have no room
at all. I once found myself relegated to the end of a hallway to conduct a train-
ing because the carpeting in the training room was being torn out as I arrived!
In any of these cases, if you do not find out until 60 minutes before the ses-
sion starts, it is most likely too late to do anything about it. You should at
least ask whether there is a different room available or that could be avail-
able at the next break or lunch. If nothing is available, you need to do a quick
shuffle in the design and make the most of it. Check for space outside the
room for breakout groups. 
Furniture not conducive to training
It may not seem like your job, but ensuring that participants have comfort-
able chairs and tables that don’t fall down is your responsibility. You can tell
the second you walk into the room whether the chairs will be comfortable or
not. You may even find that the participants will need to squeeze into one-
piece desks like those you used in high school.
You probably want to look for other space for breakout sessions. On these
occasions I’ve even taken participants outside to sit on picnic tables for
small-group activities. Participants appreciate even the smallest things you
do to provide additional comfort.
Logistics problems 
Preparation is key to preventing logistics problems. You certainly will never
be able to think of everything, but the more you plan ahead, the fewer prob-
lems you will have. Learn from each experience. Begin to create a generic
preparation checklist of items to help you remember what questions to ask,
whom to ask, and when.
Equipment problems
Nothing can be as frustrating as equipment problems. If something critical is
going to go wrong, equipment is the area that will take you down.
224
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

What could occur?
Almost anything can go wrong with equipment, starting with it simply not
showing up: Someone forgot, it was delivered to the wrong room, or perhaps
it is simply not available.
With overhead projectors, the worst thing that can happen is that the bulb may
burn out. The flipchart pad may be filled with used paper. You may not have
enough copies of the handouts for participants. Perhaps someone did not
count correctly. Perhaps more participants showed up than you anticipated.
Prevent these problems 
Some problems with equipment can be prevented. Others cannot. But that
doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try to prevent them from occurring.
Always double-check on your equipment needs. Order it at least a month in
advance, follow up one week before your session, and, finally, call the day
before to confirm date, time, location, and type of equipment.
225
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?
What can go wrong?
What can possibly go wrong? Try this for a
comedy of errors. The address given the trainer
was for 1423 East Oak, but the church was on
West Oak. It didn’t matter anyway because
when she finally arrived, the door was locked
and she couldn’t get in. She had the director’s
name and cellphone number, but the director
was an hour away and participants started to
arrive before anyone could get into the building.
Just before the director arrived another trainer
showed up who had a key. Unfortunately, this
trainer believed that he was assigned the same
training room. In fact, they were double booked.
Another room in the basement of the old church
was available. Although the trainer was just
over five feet tall, she had to duck to miss some
of the overhead pipes. Participants jumped in to
help her set up and carry her boxes of supplies.
When she tried to plug the overhead projector
into an outlet, she found that the three-pronged
plug would not fit in the archaic, two-holed
electrical receptacle. She broke the third prong
off to accommodate the electrical requirement.
When the training session started, the overhead
pipes began to perspire and drip on the partici-
pants’ materials, the overhead projector trans-
parencies, and the trainer. The trainer learned
that the participants were unaware of why they
were attending the training and thought that it
was some sort of punishment. The air condi-
tioning kicked in as soon as it was turned on but
quickly blew a fuse, and no one knew how to
replace it. The receptionist who was supposed
to have opened the church never arrived.
Therefore, the phone in the room next to the
training room rang every few minutes with no
one to answer it.
By the way, the good news was that the
trainer’s suitcase, which was temporarily “lost”
by the airline, was delivered just before she left
to go to her hotel for the evening.
Yes, this happened to me when I first started
training. The funniest thing about the situation
is that the participants said it was the best train-
ing they had ever attended.

I obtain the name and office and cellphone or pager number of the person
who is responsible for setting up the equipment. This has come in handy
more often than I can count.
When you arrive at your room, check the equipment first. Make sure it all
works, turns on, and has a spare bulb and that the cords are taped down.
Check to make sure that the flipchart pad is filled with unused paper. If at all
possible, have the equipment delivered to your room and set it up the day or
night before your session. 
And when you can’t prevent equipment problems . . .
When problems occur anyway (and they will), you can do two things. First,
have a backup plan, and second, keep your cool and follow a specific process.
 Have a backup plan. It is almost certain that your equipment will fail at
just the moment your presentation is dependent on your visuals. If you’re
prepared to deliver your presentation without the visuals, all will not be
lost. If using slides, have a hard copy so that participants can see on
paper what they would have seen on a screen. I always have a flipchart in
the room. It is available for sketching diagrams, creating lists, highlight-
ing key points, or getting your participants involved in the presentation. 
Remember, you will now be the focal point of your presentation, and all
eyes will be on you, so you need to attend to your presentation skills:
good eye contact, animated gestures, planned body movement, and con-
fident stance. You may also need to use more descriptive language, add
more examples, and paint a verbal picture for your participants that
they would have otherwise observed visually.
 Follow a specific process. Know what to try and in what order to try it.
Almost everyone uses an LCD projector and laptop computer. If this
equipment malfunctions, ask these questions:
• Is everything plugged in and turned on? Be sure to check extension
cords, too. 
• Are all the cables firmly connected to the correct input or output
ports?
• Are the projector and your laptop set up properly? Be sure that
your laptop is selected as the source and that the projector is not
in the standby mode.
• Has your laptop been set to display through the external video
port? Every laptop computer has multiple display modes and a
utility that allows you to toggle among these modes. When toggling
between modes, allow at least 15 seconds for the setting to change
before trying another mode.
• Have you tried to reset the equipment? Sometimes, simply shutting
everything down and turning it back on works.
226
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

• Have you used your laptop with this type of projector in the past?
Some computers are not compatible with some projectors. Although
it is rare, it has happened to me.
 Be positive. If your equipment failure occurs in front of participants,
don’t complain about the equipment or the situation. Offer a brief apol-
ogy, take no more than four minutes to fix it, and move on. You may wish
to call a short break, but don’t allow your participants to sit and watch
you pull, poke, and prod your equipment.
Yes, equipment can be one of the most frustrating problems a trainer
may face. But if you’re prepared, it doesn’t have to throw you off center.
Always learn something from the experience. If you were unable to fix
the problem, try to fix it after your participants leave. You may wish to
consult with the audiovisual technician. Know how to fix the problem. If
it happened once, it is likely that it will happen again.
Difficult personal situations
Sometimes, things happen to you that create problems. In many cases, it
won’t seem like a big deal the next day, but that doesn’t help when you’re in
the middle of it. What may happen and what could you do?
You forget what you were going to say
Many trainers are afraid of going brain dead in front of the participants. It
happens to everyone during daily conversations with others. However, when
it occurs in front of participants, it may be more uncomfortable. You may
wish to adapt some of these techniques to your style.
 Admit that you forgot, just as you would in a typical daily conversa-
tion. Continue on and return to the point when you remember it. 
 Take a sip of water that you have at your table. Often, the 30-second
pause will be enough time to recall your train of thought.
 Try to fill in by repeating the last point in a different way or giving an
example. Like the sip of water, it will give you a couple of seconds of
thinking time.
 Refer to your notes. Ensure that your notes work for you: You have the
information on them that you need, and you have it displayed in a way
that you can find what you need.
 If it is not obvious, shift the attention back to the participants. Ask them
what questions they have at this point. Because no one knows exactly
what you were going to do or say, it is highly unlikely that anyone will
notice the shift. 
 Have a standard phrase that you will use, such as, “I lost my train of
thought. Perhaps one of you can find it” or “I just went brain dead. Do
any of you remember what I was going to say?”
227
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

You do not feel well
Unfortunately, there is not much you can do about feeling under the weather.
The show must go on, and as a trainer, you rarely have someone to back you
up. Certainly, if you have something contagious or if you’re so ill that you will
be unable to facilitate the session, you may need to cancel. It is difficult to
cancel a training session because so many other people are counting on you.
At times, others may have traveled hundreds of miles for the training event.
If you do not feel well and you’re going to continue to conduct the training,
consider these suggestions.
 Don’t tell the participants you’re not feeling well, or if you do, don’t make
a big deal out of it. You may get sympathy, but is that what you want? 
 Shift the session to put more emphasis on participant involvement and
activities. You will most likely have participants who have experience
and expertise related to the topic. Ask them to assist with delivering
information, or leading a discussion.
It is never any fun to work when you do not feel well. Being a trainer is one of
those professions, however, that allows little flexibility when illness occurs. 
You get off track
It is so easy to get off track. Thousands of detours cross your path. Sometimes,
participants may take you off track with a question. At other times, you may
take yourself off track because you tell a story or you add information that is
nice to know. 
As soon as you recognize that you’re off track, steer the group back. Try
these techniques to help you.
 Try to connect what you’re saying to where you should be.
 Humor may work. Wrap up the topic quickly and say something like,
“My, that was a distracting little detour!”
 If it is difficult to get back on track, take a break.
You’re new to the job
Everyone has to start somewhere. Being new to training is not something,
however, that you need to announce to the group. Imagine that you were get-
ting on a flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt. You probably do not want the
pilot to announce that this is her first flight. Likewise, you do not need to
announce that this is your first training session.
In fact, you should never need to make excuses. Using the phrase “bear with
me” makes participants feel as if they are putting up with something that is
uncalled for. Don’t use it. “Bear with me, this is my first training!” may estab-
lish a hesitancy from participants right from the start.
228
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Difficult group situation
Sometimes, it may seem that the entire group is creating a problem — and it
could be true.
Why might this occur?
Participants’ style may not be a match for the training design. For example, if
the design calls for a great deal of participation and the audience is made up
of analytical styles, you may not get the level of discussion and involvement
that is required.
The group may also be preoccupied by other thoughts. For example, if you’re
training them to learn how to improve processes or make change of any kind,
and they know that the company needs to become more efficient, they may
be concerned about whether downsizing may occur and how it may affect
them. They may also be preoccupied with less threatening thoughts; for
example, when training is held to support a change, everyone may feel over-
whelmed with the additional work required after the change is implemented.
At other times, they may simply be concerned with the work that is piling up
on their desks while they are attending the training.
Participants may have never been told why they are attending training. They
may think that it is punishment because they are not doing their jobs well
enough. Participants need to understand how the training affects performance
and the vision and mission of the organization, as well as what’s in it for them.
It is impossible to identify all the reasons an entire group may be causing dif-
ficulty. Techniques exist that help to prevent these problems and to address
them when they do occur.
Preventing these problems 
You may be able to prevent some of these problems.
 Focus on participants’ needs during the design.
 Know as much as possible about the participants who will attend the
training session, including such things as their communication style,
their attitude toward training, what changes may be going on in their
workplace, whether they are all at the same level, and why they think
they are attending the training session. You may want to ask what expec-
tations participants are bringing with them to the session or what pro-
fessional issues participants may be dealing with.
 Refer to the needs assessment to give you insight about why the training
is being held.
 Interview participants prior to the training session to identify concerns
and how you will approach them.
229
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

 Be certain that the problem isn’t one that you created. For example,
you may not have clearly stated how the training is related to the 
participants — what’s in it for them. You may not have established your
credibility. Or you may not be providing enough breaks.
If you encounter a difficult group, unexpectedly, it is almost always best to
address the issue as soon as you’re sure. How can you do this?
You may wish to probe a few participants during the first break with “The
group seems reluctant to speak up” or “Everyone seems preoccupied, is
something happening that I should know?”
You may also just stop the training session and admit that something seems
amiss and address it with the group. When I do this, I usually make some dra-
matic shift that says “We have changed focus.” I may pull up a chair in the
middle of the room and sit down and begin a discussion. After a hostile or
negative statement, I may take a very long pause, cap my pen, and close my
facilitator’s guide, and say, “Okay, we need to talk.” How do I open the discus-
sion? I state the behaviors I have observed and then say something like “It
seems to me that we need to address the cause of these behaviors before we
can be successful with this training.” I then pause and wait for someone to
speak up. At some point I may list the issues on a flipchart page to prevent
people from repeating what has already been stated.
If you have a group that is not responding to you or the content of the train-
ing, it is best to address it as soon as possible. If you do not, you will proba-
bly just be wasting time — yours and the participants. 
Note: Sometimes, it may seem as if you have a problem group on your hands
when in reality only a few individuals may be causing the problem. Managing
individual participants who may make the training difficult is addressed in
the “Managing disruptive types” section later in this chapter.
If training is not the solution
Even though you have conducted a needs assessment and the organization
has determined that training is required, you may find that training really is
not the solution. There is probably little you can do on the spot except to
ensure that you create a meaningful experience for the participants. In many
cases, you may not change the agenda much, but you may refocus the discus-
sion to topics that provide more usable information. 
I was hired many years ago to conduct a Communications Training. I found a
group of 20 men who would not speak up, were angry, and obviously did not
want to be there. After the introduction module, I quickly called a break and
discovered that all of these people had been slated for a downsizing and the
training in communication skills was a part of development for outplacement.
230
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

No one had told me. After the break, we identified some of the issues they
were facing, and I adjusted the communication training material, making it as
meaningful and useful as I could. 
Using a process similar to the one in the “A ten-step solution when training is
not” sidebar, I uncovered what communication skills they thought they would
need given the situation. I adjusted the program accordingly and salvaged
what was going to be a worthless day for the participants.
231
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?
A ten-step solution when training is not 
If you’re facing a situation where training isn’t
the solution or perhaps the training isn’t focused
on the right topic, you can follow these steps to
make the best of the situation.
 Call a timeout. Put the program agenda on
hold because the participants are probably
not ready to hear or use the information
anyway.
 Summarize your understanding of the range
of viewpoints you’ve heard expressed.
 Use a flipchart and ask participants to help
you list all the reasons the program is
meaningless (or whatever else their key
issue is). Allow enough time for them to list
all the reasons they can think of. Post all the
responses on a wall.
 Explain that if they take a look at their list,
they may notice that some of their issues
are controllable and some are not. Ask for
a few examples about any of the items they
believe are out of their control. Allow suffi-
cient “ventilation” time.
 Acknowledge that when situations are out
of someone’s control, there’s nothing that
can be done to change those situations —
for the moment. Explain that the best oppor-
tunity for change starts by focusing on
what’s controllable. Give an example based
on one of the items posted on the wall and
ask for agreement.
 Say something like “So here’s the chal-
lenge: Look over your list, and let’s try to
come up with a new list — a list of what you
have control over.” The group may be slow
to start. Don’t panic; hang in there and
restate the question. When they catch on
that you’re serious and will stay with the
question until it’s been answered, you will
get responses.
 Record their ideas on flipchart paper and
encourage input with “Good. How about
another one?” As their energy starts to ebb,
congratulate them for putting together a
great list. Explain that you will give them a
break now, and when they come back you’d
like them to think about how to apply the
balance of the program information they’ll
be receiving in terms of what’s controllable.
Check for agreement.
 Tell them that you’re going to remove the
obstacles currently posted on the wall and
replace them with the flipchart listing what
the group believes is controllable. Do so.
Use the break to rethink what you will cover
and how you will cover it during the rest of
the time allocated for the program.
 When participants return from break,
explain that it was important to make time
to discuss their concerns. Describe your
plan for how to proceed and get agreement.
Check in with participants toward the end
of the session or during another appropri-
ate time to learn their current thinking.
 Privately congratulate yourself.

Taking a COOL approach
You may have done everything that has been suggested so far in this chapter,
and something may still go wrong. If something happens when you least
expect it, you need to be prepared to think on your feet. I suggest you use a
COOL approach.
Calm down immediately
Although it is difficult to do, the first step is to remain calm. Take a deep
breath, focus on the situation, and determine the root cause. After the
oxygen hits your brain, you’re better able to determine what to do next.
Open yourself to all the options
When something goes wrong, a can-do attitude may get you into trouble
because you want to charge right in and “fix it.” There is no one right answer
to any problem, so be open to all possibilities. If others are with you (partici-
pants or another trainer), ask for their ideas. Do a quick pros and cons
assessment of all the alternatives in your mind and select one option.
Optimistically implement your options 
After you have selected the solution, move forward optimistically knowing
that you have chosen the best alternative considering all the factors. I don’t
mean be dogmatic about your choice no matter what. I do mean be positive
and move forward. Don’t second-guess yourself with “should haves.”
Look at it from another perspective
A friend of mine taught me to always look at problems from a “What’s good
about it?” perspective. You could look at any problem from other perspec-
tives as well, such as “What’s funny about it?” or “What lesson did I learn
from this?” Whether you try to find what’s good about the problem or some
other perspective, this technique will maintain your professionalism. It will
also ensure that you learn from the experience and transfer that learning to
future situations.
Using humor to deal with problems
In some cases, humor may be your only option. For example, if you’re using a
microphone that isn’t working, you can ask, “How many in the back can read
lips?”
Humor is not for everyone. If it isn’t natural, or if you feel as if you’re forcing
it, don’t use it. You don’t need to be funny to get through problems. Efficiency,
grace, kindness, and a positive attitude work, too.
232
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

Maintaining a sense of humor as well as a sense of flexibility is critical to your
success as a trainer. Flexibility and humor may also be critical to your sanity,
as you can see in the “ebb’s ten laws of training trip-ups” sidebar. Although
the sidebar humorously suggests that no matter how well you prepare some-
thing may go wrong anyway, you still must prepare as well as you can. The
key message is to maintain your sense of humor.
Managing Disruptive Behaviors
Sometimes, you can see them walking in the door — the disruptive behaviors.
They may be vying for the center of attention, are boisterous, or are negatively
outspoken. On the other hand, they may ignore everyone and refuse to make
eye contact right from the start. Disruptive behaviors interrupt the flow of
the training session and have a negative effect on the positive climate you’re
trying to create.
In this book, I emphasize the importance of interaction and participative
learning in almost every chapter. Of course, most positive things usually have
a negative correlation. As you increase interaction and participation among
your participants, you give them a high level of flexibility, and you always risk
the chance that some participants may get out of hand, easily leading to
more active disruptive situations.
233
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?
ebb’s ten laws of training trip-ups
I work diligently at preparing for and preventing
problems that plague trainers. It seems that
something new always comes along. I have
found a sense of humor to be invaluable. Over
the years the staff at my company, ebb associ-
ates inc, have created this list of things that can
trip up training. Although it is written tongue-in-
cheek, at times it is oh so true!
 If you’re expecting 15 participants, 30 will
show up.
 If you’re expecting 30 participants, 15 will
show up.
 The electricity will go out exactly when
you’re ready to show a video.
 The only typo in your entire program will
show up on the handout about quality.
 The day you order fruit in the morning, the
group will want jelly doughnuts with real
butter.
 The day you order jelly doughnuts, the
group will want fruit with yogurt. 
 The room reservation you made will cancel
itself only on days when there are no other
rooms available.
 The contact person at your training site will
be sick on the day of your training.
 If you arrive at the training site early to do
some last-minute preparation, the most
talkative participant will arrive early as well.
 A perfectly open room will sprout a pillar
right in the middle of your U-shaped table
arrangement.

Preventing disruptions
The best approach to disruptive behavior is to prevent the disruption from
occurring in the first place. Both your attitude and how you manage disruptive
individuals sets the stage for the ease with which you manage disruptions. 
Create a climate in which participants feel free to give each other feedback
on their behaviors: Build trust, reward appropriate behavior, ignore inappro-
priate behavior, and develop ground rules.
You will facilitate the group to establish ground rules at the beginning of
the training session. These ground rules will prevent many problems from
occurring — but not all. As you establish the ground rules, ask the partici-
pants to help you manage them.
Allowing participants to determine their own ground rules gives them owner-
ship. You can guide them to include rules that address the kind of behavior
you want to foster, such as these:
 How to address punctuality. For example, “We will return from breaks on
time.” Or “We will start and end on time.”
 How participants will communicate during the training session. For
example, “We will take turns speaking during the session.” Or “Questions
are encouraged.”
 What level of participation is expected. For example, “Participation
should be balanced among participants.” Or “We will encourage each
other to speak up.”
 How everyone will demonstrate respect toward each other. For example,
“We will respect each other’s ideas.” Or “We will not interrupt when
someone is speaking.” Or “Attack the concept, not the person.”
Post your ground rules so that they serve to guide behavior; then, you don’t
need to be the bad cop in enforcing appropriate classroom behavior. Instead,
you can ask, “What did we agree upon in our ground rules?” and allow the
participants to police themselves with their answers.
In a multiple-day training session, be sure to review the ground rules each
morning and ask whether the group would like to add any others or even to
rate itself on how well members are upholding the ground rules. You can use
other general strategies throughout your session that will help to manage dis-
ruptive participants. For example, you will
 Reward and model appropriate behavior.
 Show genuine interest in all individuals.
 Be open to and invite individuals’ comments, ideas, and disagreements.
234
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

If someone disagrees with you, be professional and respectful. Acknowledge
that there are different ways to think about the topic. Take care that you do
not become defensive nor are you drawn into an argument. Thank the person
for offering a different viewpoint and respond appropriately. If you expect a
long discussion, you may tell the participant that you’re interested in the dis-
cussion and request that you continue it during the next break.
These kinds of strategies build trust with your participants and help to make
the learning environment one that is productive for everyone attending your
training session.
Managing disruptive types
Even after you do all you can to prevent disruptions, disruptions will still
occur. When they do, I like to give the disruptive participants the benefit of
the doubt. In many cases, they are unaware of the disruptions their behavior
is causing. Often, all you need to do is let the disrupters know how their
behavior is affecting you and the rest of the class.
Remember, some folks bring some very heavy baggage into the training with
them. A participant may have recently suffered a bereavement or have a
child who is not doing well in school. Another may be unhappy on the job or
is anticipating a downsizing. Facilitators need to be sensitive to the fact that
something may be causing the behavior and they may never know what it is. 
Many disruptive behavior types exist. Movie Stars, Deserters, Comedians,
Blockers, Attackers, and Dominators are six of the most common.
Movie Stars
Movie Stars like attention and want to be the center of the action. Sometimes,
Movie Stars just have lots of pent-up energy and need to focus it in a positive
direction. To address Movie Stars, you can:
 Ask them to help with demonstrations or other tasks, thus using their
desire for attention to your advantage.
 Point out to them that you want to get others’ ideas first: “Let’s see what
others have to say.”
 Assign a specified amount of time for each response.
Deserters
Deserters come in several models. One deserter may have side conversations
that prevent participation; another deserter may simply be reluctant to speak
up; still another may have participated earlier in the session but now has
pulled out.
235
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

Each of these participants has reasons for playing the Deserter role — and
some may be positive. For example, the side-conversation deserters may be
so excited about the concepts you’re delivering that they want to share how
they will implement them with their neighbor. They are often not even aware
that they are causing a disruption. Some Deserters are reluctant to speak up
and may simply be shy. Many have told me that they feel they are participat-
ing 100 percent. Others are analyzer types who like to think more than speak. 
It is a third type, the Deserter who was a solid participator earlier in the ses-
sion, but now has pulled out, that concerns me the most. Something has hap-
pened that changed the participation level. Perhaps the person received
some bad news during a break. Perhaps something happened during the ses-
sion that upset the participant. It behooves you to find out whether this is
the case. To deal with Deserters:
 Manage side conversations by casually sauntering behind the two talkers
and continuing to present over their conversations. This often works.
 Ask a question directly of the Deserter who is reluctant to speak up,
starting with easy questions that don’t test knowledge. The round robin
(going around the group, one person at a time) is a good tool to use with
this Deserter. You can also form smaller discussion groups to bring out
the shy participant.
 The Deserter who was once active but now is not should be a concern
to you. Pull the person aside at the first opportunity (perhaps during a
break) and ask what has changed. Often, something happened outside the
training session. If so, you need not pry. However, sometimes, you may
have inadvertently done something that made the participant pull out.
 If you desire participation from everyone, ask the class to write their
answers on index cards before verbalizing. This technique gives every-
one a fair chance. It keeps the vocal participants busy writing while the
quiet participants have a chance to think through their responses.
Comedians
Comedians, the class clowns, may also be looking for attention through
humorous remarks. I like to give these folks the benefit of the doubt. They
may have a very positive attitude and are trying to add levity to the training
session. To deal with Comedians:
 Ignore the humor as long as it is not disruptive. Unfortunately, most
people laugh at the first couple of comments and that keeps the
Comedian going.
 Ask Comedians to relate their point to the discussion at hand.
 Give feedback to the Comedian during the next break if the disruption
continues.
236
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 Ask Comedians serious questions. If they cannot provide serious
answers, you know you have a problem on your hands that probably
needs to be addressed one on one with the person.
 If the disruption spreads throughout the group or if it gets out of hand,
you may wish to call a break.
Blockers
Blockers are the naysayers in the group. They are the ones who are negative
and don’t believe anything will work. I give these folks a break because often I
have found them to have valuable background information, but have not fig-
ured out how to get them to appropriately explain their side of the story. To
get them to disrupt less, you could
 Ask what alternative they are willing to propose.
 Be sure that they do not take the class off on a tangential topic, based on
some hidden agenda they may have.
 Ask the group for other opinions regarding what a blocker may have said.
 Ask them, “What would need to happen in order for the idea (concept,
change, or others) to work?” Expect them to respond with “It won’t
work.” Keep asking what would have to happen and by the third or
fourth time a response will roll out of their mouth. In my experience,
their thoughts are worth pursuing. 
Attackers
Attackers toss out barbs directed toward the trainer, other participants, or
the content. They may call people names and give dirty looks. I’ve often
found that Attackers have never learned an appropriate way to disagree. To
deal with Attackers:
 Ask them to confine their comments to the situation, not the people.
 Refer them to the ground rule that addresses respect.
 Some attackers may not be aware of how they come across. In this case,
the trainer’s feedback may be accepted and even appreciated.
 Ask other participants whether they agree with the statement.
 Sometimes it is appropriate to explore their comments further.
 If not directed at individuals in the room, ignore until a break when you
can discuss with the Attacker to identify the root of the problem.
Dominators 
Dominators take up much air time by talking, sometimes repeating them-
selves, and sometimes speaking slowly and in great detail. You can’t ignore
the dominators; other participants will get frustrated, bored, and lose inter-
est. To address Dominators:
237
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

 Break eye contact with them and call on others by name for answers.
 Consider holding your hand up as if trying to stop a car if they continue
to talk without being recognized.
 Impose a time limit on all participants’ statements.
 Break into the middle of a long statement when they take a breath and
ask for others’ opinions.
 Assign a gatekeeper role to one of the participants.
 To balance participation with a dominator or two in your training ses-
sion, pose a situation or question and ask people to raise their hands if
they have a response. Then call on someone other than the dominators.
 Create a bin list or parking lot (a sheet of flipchart paper on which you
write questions or ideas). Parking lots are used to post comments that are
not appropriate for discussion at the current time but will be addressed
later in the session. If you have pads of sticky-back notes on the table, you
can have dominators write their comments and post them on the parking
lot. This prevents repetition of the same comment. 
Although other types of disruptive participants, such as the Rambler, the
Clueless, and the Know-it-all, exist, knowing how to address the preceding six
will prepare you for most situations you encounter. In all situations, you
would be wise to identify the disruptive person’s needs. That may help you
determine a solution. 
Remember, ignoring a disruptive behavior is one way to address it. I usually
ignore most things the first time. It is repetitive disruptions that affect the
results of your class. You can always call a break if things get out of hand.
Never hesitate to pull the person aside at a break to identify the problem and
what you may be able to do about it.
On very rare occasions, you may need to ask the participant to leave. If you
have pulled the person aside and you can’t reach a win-win agreement about
how to handle the situation, tell the person what kind of cooperation you
need. Ask whether the person would be more comfortable staying — and
agreeing to your request — or leaving. Reassure the person that you would
prefer him to stay and benefit from the session, but you can’t allow others’
learning to suffer from continued disruptions.
If you have established a climate of trust and support, often the rest of the
participants will take care of the disruptive participant for you.
Remember that most of the problems identified are outside your control. You
could not have prevented them nor predicted them. Ask yourself whether
you could have done something better. If yes, consider it a lesson learned; if
not, chalk it up to experience. Accept the fact that people attend training
packing their baggage with them. And sometimes, you do the best that you
know how and move on.

Sweaty Palms, Parched Throat:
Overcoming Nervousness
Stage fright. Presentation anxiety. Nervousness. Platform panic. Pre-
performance jitters. Butterflies. Training fear. Nervous tension. Being keyed
up or flustered. Whatever you call it, it is normal to be nervous near the
beginning of a training session. Several studies show that more American
adults are more fearful of talking to a large group than they are of dying!
If you ask other trainers, most will tell you that they experience a bit of anxi-
ety at the beginning of every training session. And they are in good company,
too. History suggests that Abe Lincoln shook the first few minutes of every
speech. In an interview, Yul Brynner admitted to stage fright after appearing
on stage in The King and I more than 600 times. Jack Benny, Jane Fonda, Mark
Twain, and Ali McGraw are all people who have admitted to nervous tension
prior to a big gig.
Recognize first that nervousness is a normal response. Almost everyone gets
butterflies. The key is to master your nervousness and get those butterflies
to fly in formation!
Understanding pre-performance jitters
Where do those performance butterflies come from? They are caused by a
natural fear response. Your brain perceives a threatening situation and pre-
pares your body for a flight-or-fight situation. This is the same fight-or-flight
mechanism that helped early humans battle rampaging saber-toothed tigers
and other ferocious beasts. Adrenalin and thyroxin are dumped into your
bloodstream, causing your heart to race, your blood pressure to rise, and
your pupils to dilate. Your liver gets busy pumping sugar, and your blood
increases its ability to clot. Your body is on red alert — ready for the worst!
Here’s the good news. You do not want to eliminate all your nervous energy.
Just as the flow of adrenalin gives runners the edge to win a race, this same
adrenalin can give you the mental edge to be a dynamic trainer. You want to
accept your nervousness as a natural phenomenon, and use it to fuel a more
enthusiastic and dynamic training session. As you feel the adrenalin flowing,
embrace the energy that it brings.
Accepting your nervousness as natural
How can you make nervousness work for you? First and most importantly,
don’t tell your participants that you’re nervous. Remember, they are attending
239
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

because you’re the expert. They expect you to succeed, but if you start the
training session by saying “Whew! Am I nervous!” they will begin looking for
signs of nervousness. If you never tell them, most will never know. Again,
don’t admit your nervousness to the participants.
Next, know how your body reacts in this situation and accept it. Perhaps
your heart races. Maybe your throat gets dry. Perhaps you fidget with things
in your pocket. Whatever it is, know how you react, and then accept it as nat-
ural. You may even say to yourself, “Oh, my heart is pounding. I knew that
would happen.” Accept the reality.
Define how your body reacts. Examine the nervous symptoms in Table 12-1
and place a check in the column that describes when this occurs for you:
before or during a training session.

Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

Mastering nervous symptoms
Okay, so you have three symptoms before the training begins and three dif-
ferent ones that occur during the training. What can you do about them?
Some symptoms you can do little more than camouflage so that your partici-
pants won’t notice. Others you can actually learn to change. Here are some
general things you can do to physically and mentally prepare yourself for
your next training event.
Prepare physically: Relax and be ready
You can do many things to prepare yourself and your surroundings before your
session. Most of them relate to relaxing and making yourself comfortable.
 Master relaxation techniques. Head rolls, shoulder rolls, or dangling
your arms at your sides all work well. Practice these techniques as you
prepare for your session. Then use those that work best for you just
before you begin your session. Even deep yawning helps you relax. A
yawn sends a message to your brain that you’re ready to relax.
 Use isometric exercises prior to training. Tightening various muscles,
curling your toes or squeezing on a rubber ball before starting the train-
ing session works for many trainers.
 Practice deep breathing. Several deep breaths, in through your nose
and out through your mouth, add oxygen to and clear your brain. This is
especially useful just minutes before you start.
I take a couple of deep breaths while the host is introducing me. No one can
see what I am doing. I get oxygen flowing and it helps to focus me on the task
at hand.
 Arrive early to ground yourself with the room and make it yours.
When participants arrive, greet them. Mingle with as many as you can
and learn something about those you meet. Getting to know individuals
reduces some of the barriers you may have imagined and decreases
some of the fear you may have felt. During the training session, find one
or two of the friendly faces you met before the training session started.
Return to those friendly faces, but be sure that you do not speak solely
to them.
 Don’t try anything new. No new suit, haircut, or shoes. Wear something
that you have felt comfortable in before. This is one less thing to worry
about. I once saw a trainer who appeared in a new suit — complete with
price tags!
242
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

 If you have a crutch, use it. For some, their crutch is to use audiovisu-
als early to divert the participants’ gazes. For others, it may be to have
their notes outlined or highlighted in a particular way. For me, it means
having a glass of water nearby. At any time, whether my throat is dry or I
forget what I am supposed to do or say, I can reach for the water, take a
swallow, and compose myself.
 Organize ahead. Check out Chapter 7 for specific ways to prepare your-
self and the environment. Just knowing that everything is ready to go is
relaxing in itself.
 Do something physical. Take a walk just before the session starts. Do
some stretches or wall pushups. One trainer told me that he goes into
the men’s restroom and does a couple of jumping jacks to release pent-
up energy.
 During the session, use up excess energy with gestures and your vocal
presentation. Speak and gesture to the person who is the farthest away
from you. Moving about, as long as it is not distracting or in a repeated
pattern, for example, two steps to the left, then two steps to the right,
will also use up some of your extra energy.
Prepare mentally: Psyching up, not out
You can also prepare yourself mentally. Your brain perceives only what you
tell it. If you tell yourself that you’re going to be nervous, trip over the cord,
and forget what you’re supposed to say, you will most likely be nervous, trip
over the cord, and forget what you’re supposed to say. Get the picture? It
243
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?
A 15-second relaxer
Try this relaxation technique. It takes only 15
seconds and works in almost any situation
when you need to reduce anxiety.
1. Lower your head so that you’re looking
straight down.
2. Squeeze your thumb and index fingertips
together on both hands.
3. While squeezing your thumb and finger,
inhale deeply while silently affirming, “I
am calm and relaxed.”
4. Exhale slowly, relax your fingers, and tell
yourself, “I am prepared and confident.”
5. Repeat four times as you visualize a suc-
cessful training session.
6. Lift your head and smile to whoever is in
your eyesight.

takes the same amount of time to paint a good mental picture as a bad one.
These ideas will help you psych up for the next training session.
 Realize that you will be somewhat nervous. Accept it as a fact. 
 Know what to expect when you get nervous and accept it. When the
symptoms occur, say to yourself, “Oh, yes. There it is. I knew my heart
would start racing right about now!”
 Recognize that the participants want you to succeed. Forget yourself
and put your group first. Focus on the needs of your participants. Think
about how important what you have to say is to them.
 Think of your presentation as extended conversation. Imagine that
you’re talking to your good friend, Dan Greene — except that there are
lots of Dan Greenes in the group. Look into their eyes and connect with
them on an individual level.
 Visualize yourself being successful. Don’t spend energy imagining the
worst. Instead, imagine the best. Tell yourself that this is going to be the
best darned training these participants have ever attended. 
 Plan to get your participants involved in the training early. Ask a ques-
tion, begin introductions, or start the icebreaker as quickly as you can.
After your participants are involved, you will feel more like you’re con-
ducting a two-way conversation than a presentation. Going into the
training session knowing that within three minutes participants will be
actively involved and not staring at you gives you a real mental boost.
 Try appropriate humor early to help you mentally hear approval from
your participants. Humor should not be translated as “jokes.” Humor can
be many things other than jokes. And jokes are not always humorous.
Humor can make you feel comfortable in front of a group. Telling a bad
joke will not. Although you may see speakers who begin with a joke,
don’t do it unless you know you can pull it off successfully. To be more
successful, the joke must tie to content. The joke must be politically
appropriate. You must have practiced it at least three dozen times with
success almost 100 percent of the time. If you have any doubts about the
joke, don’t use it.
 Keep your presentation in perspective. What if you do something
wrong? Can you correct it? Will the participants even know that some-
thing was incorrect? And is it the end of the world if you aren’t perfect?
And finally: Practice, practice, practice
In Chapter 7, I discuss practicing the mechanics of your presentation and
learning the content. Now you want to think about how practice can assist
you with nervousness. 
244
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

As I mention throughout this book and specifically in Chapter 7, nothing is
more important to a successful training session than being well prepared.
And nothing is more helpful in overcoming nervousness than knowing your
material and knowing that you know your material. That takes practice. Use
these suggestions to practice your training material.
 Memorize the first couple of paragraphs you will say. Nervousness
goes away for most trainers after 5 to 15 minutes. If you know what you
will say for the first few minutes, you can get to the other side of your
nervousness.
 Practice in front of a mirror. Many trainers swear by this method. Look
yourself in the eye and train away. I must admit that although it works
well for many trainers, it doesn’t work for me. I prefer several of the next
few methods.
 Use a tape recorder. If you record yourself, you can listen to the tape
while you’re driving or doing other things. An added benefit of listening
to the tape is that you can critique your pace, pauses, clarity, articula-
tion, and other vocal characteristics. 
 Practice activities with your colleagues. Try the training activities with
other people in your department. Practice giving the same directions.
Do they understand what you want them to do and the purpose of the
activity? I like to ask for a critique as well. What went well? What do they
think I could do better?
 Practice using the visuals. Practice several times with whatever audiovi-
sual equipment you will use. Practice turning the equipment on and off.
Practice with the actual visuals. Being comfortable with the media you
will use will reduce your anxiety level. Your visuals should feel natural —
almost an extension of yourself.
 Practice out loud. Practice pronouncing difficult words — or find a way
to eliminate them. Practicing aloud allows you the opportunity to time
your presentation. You may be surprised at how much time it actually
takes to deliver some of the training material. Nervousness decreases
the more often you hear yourself state the content.
 Present some of the training material to your spouse, significant other,
or your dog. Really! Dogs make great practice participants. They make
great eye contact, and some will listen forever, giving you only positive
nonverbal feedback.
 Get practice in front of groups in other situations as well. You could
try out for a play. You could join Toastmasters, National Speakers
Association, or other speaking groups. You can then accept a club office
or volunteer to give toasts for special occasions. 
245
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

The more often you practice your material, the better you’ll be prepared for
your session. In addition, the more opportunities you have to speak in other
situations, the better you will understand, appreciate, and improve your
training skills. The better trainer you become, the more confidence you will
have, which will reduce your nervousness even more.
Tips for specific anxiety problems
Return to the checklist of nervous symptoms in Table 12-1. The ideas in this
section refer to specific symptoms you may have checked. In some cases,
your only solution is to camouflage the symptom; in others, you can actually
do something about the symptom. 
As you read through these tips, remember that the symptoms occur because
your body is readying itself for a fight-or-flight situation. Therefore, you must
trick it back into thinking that everything is okay again — which it is!
 Voice: Few participants will notice any voice symptoms. A crackling
voice usually indicates tense neck muscles or inadequate air supply.
Stretch you neck or clear your throat. Deep breathing and a swallow of
water may also help. Speaking too rapidly may be the most annoying to
the listener. Plan pauses at specific points and write a reminder to your-
self in the margin of your notes to “slow down.”
Grandma’s warm tea with honey and lemon is a home remedy that really
does work. The honey coats your throat, and the warm tea relaxes your
throat muscles. Iced beverages tend to constrict your vocal cords even
more. Try to avoid them during the initial portion of your training session. 
 Verbal fluency: Ensure that you know your material completely. Should
you lose your place, simply state that the idea will come to you momen-
tarily and move to another idea. Also, consider some of the ideas in the
“Difficult personal situations” section presented earlier in this chapter. 
Um, ahh, you know! If fillers are a problem, you will not eliminate them
until you hear yourself say them. Appoint an Um Counter during your
training session. This is typically a colleague, not one of your partici-
pants. Making eye contact with the Um Counter will remind you to
attend to your fillers. 
Write UM in large red capital letters on each page of your notes. Seeing
the UM has the same effect as making eye contact with the um-counter.
It will remind you to listen to yourself.
 Mouth and throat: Eliminate dry throat by biting on a lemon wedge or
spraying with Binaca, a breath freshener. Have a glass of water available,
and avoid taking antihistamines before speaking. Also avoid dairy prod-
ucts for four hours prior to a session to prevent the mucus build-up that
246
Part III: Showtime: Delivering a Dynamic Training Session 

requires clearing your throat. You can prevent most breathing difficulties
by completing deep-breathing exercises.
 Facial expression: Make eye contact with people you met before the
training session started. Think of them as your friends and smile. If a
nervous twitch is something you cannot control, camouflage it until it
stops by turning that side of your face away from the participants.
Experiment with ways to stop the twitch between training sessions.
Sometimes, rubbing a twitch or pressing on it will make it stop. Besides,
most participants will not likely notice it anyway.
 Arms and hands: The more you try to control trembling hands or
wobbly knees, the more they seem to shake. Instead, isolate one muscle
group and shake out the stress just before you present, much like you
see athletes do while waiting for their race. You can also use this tech-
nique inconspicuously while participants are working in small groups or
while they meet other participants during their warm-up exercise. Until
the shaking stops, avoid having your hand in front of audiovisual lights
or holding flimsy paper. Use note cards instead. They won’t rattle and
quiver. 
If you’re a fidgeter, remove everything from your pockets. Also, place all
pens in one place and out of your reach. Participants will be distracted
if you’re clicking a pen. Get in the habit of using a marker, replacing the
cap, and then placing it back in its intended location.
 Body movement: Start by standing near enough to a table so that you
can use it like a touchstone to orient yourself to one place. Plant your-
self in front of the group with feet slightly farther apart than normal and
with your hands at your sides. In extreme cases you may want to focus
on keeping your weight on the balls of your feet. Be sure you have not
locked your knees. In addition to making you appear rigid, it also adds
tension to your system.
 Physiological symptoms: Sweaty palms? Try talc or antiperspirant, but
experiment a couple days before to determine whether it is comfortable
and doesn’t rub off on your clothing. Have tissues available nearby. Taking
long, slow breaths may slow your heart beat. In extreme cases, you may
need to breathe deeply and hold your breath just before you begin your
session. Camouflage your flushed skin by wearing darker-colored clothing
next to your skin. White makes red, flushed skin stand out.
Remember three things about nervousness:
 Even if you’re very nervous, you will almost always look much better
than you feel.
 To make those butterflies fly in formation, you must first recognize that
you’re experiencing a natural feeling.
 Focusing on your participants and their needs is a helpful way to over-
come nervousness.
247
Chapter 12: Addressing Problems: What’s a Trainer to Do?

It should be somewhat comforting to know that even the most experienced
trainers feel some apprehension when stepping in front of a group for the
first time. And further, most of the nervousness settles down for most train-
ers within minutes. Addressing nervousness is not about how to get rid of it
but rather, how to manage it. Know how your body reacts to training jitters
and be prepared to do what it takes to make those butterflies fly in formation.
Problems Can Be Prevented or Resolved
I hope you’re feeling that even though problems are a way of life for a trainer,
all is not lost. You can do many things to prevent problems from occurring.
And when problems do crop up, you can do many things to resolve them.
I can give you but one guarantee in training. You’re going to have problems.
When it is happening it’s not very funny. A lesson that I have learned, however,
is that all those problems eventually become lessons learned. I learn some-
thing from them. Even better, I can sometimes turn these not-so-funny experi-
ences into humorous stories for some later training session. Remember, Will
Rogers said, “Everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else.”

The Follow-Up

In this part . . .
You discover the value of follow up. Just because the
training session has ended, that doesn’t mean your
work has ended. This answers questions like, Why is eval-
uation critical to the training process? How can you use
what you glean from the evaluation process to make
improvements? What kind of follow-up activities are most
beneficial?

valuate performance — that’s the fifth and last stage of the ADDIE model
discussed in Chapter 3. When you reach this stage, you have made it
through the entire Training Cycle, and it is now that you can see the beauty
of the complete cycle. You will find yourself returning to the earlier stages
during the evaluation stage. For example, you will return to the assessment
stage to ensure that you’re evaluating what you designed the training for in
the first place. You may use the objectives you wrote in the second stage to
create specific evaluation criteria. You want the training objectives you write
to be specific, measurable, and easily converted to items on an evaluation
instrument or performance rating.
The evaluation stage of The Training Cycle, highlighted in Figure 13-1, is
important to you as a trainer. It is here that you can prove your value as a
business partner to your organization. You will be able to answer questions
such as, How has training changed employee performance? How has training
increased sales or reduced expenses? How has training reduced rework and
defects? How has training affected turnover and employee satisfaction? And
ultimately, how is training affecting the bottom line? 
In this chapter, I expand on the reason for conducting evaluations, describe
Kirkpatrick’s four levels of evaluation, and provide guidance for how to
design your own evaluation plan. 
An exciting aspect of this chapter is “The training evaluation guru” sidebar,
written by Dr. Don Kirkpatrick. His practical and logical thinking process for
how he developed the four levels proves that everything doesn’t need to be
complicated. Sometimes, less is better. This chapter also presents an inter-
view with Jack Phillips (see the “An interview with Jack Phillips” sidebar),
another leader in the training evaluation arena. I feel fortunate to have both
of these gentlemen explain their perspective of the development of evaluation.

Understanding the Purpose
of Evaluations
The purpose of training is to change employees: their behavior, opinions,
knowledge, or level of skill. The purpose of evaluation is to determine whether
the objective was met and whether these changes have taken place. One way
to consider the importance of evaluations is to recognize the feedback it pro-
vides. Feedback can be obtained through self-reporting or by observing the
learner.
Various kinds of evaluations provide feedback to different people.
 Employees regarding their success in mastering new knowledge, atti-
tudes, and skills
 Employees concerning their work-related strengths and weaknesses.
Evaluation results can be a source of positive reinforcement and an
incentive for motivation
 Trainers for developing future interventions and program needs or cre-
ating modifications in the current training efforts
 Supervisors as to whether there is observable change in employees’
effectiveness or performance as a result of participating in the training
program

Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

The very location of evaluation at the end of The Training Cycle or near the
end of this book doesn’t mean that you don’t think about it until the end.
Quite the contrary. You begin thinking about how you will measure the
results of the training very early in the design stage — soon after you deter-
mine objectives. Decide how you can measure whether the objectives have
been achieved.
Reviewing Kirkpatrick’s Four 
Levels of Evaluation
The concept of different levels of evaluation helps you understand the mea-
surement and evaluation process. Don Kirkpatrick originally developed his
four levels of training evaluation — reaction, learning, behavior, and results
— almost one-half century ago. Although some organizations now add a fifth
level for return on investment (ROI), Kirkpatrick’s original four levels are as
applicable today as they were in the 1950s. 
As I discuss each of the four levels, note the elegant but simple sequence
from Level I through Level IV. At each level the data become more objective
and more meaningful to management and the bottom line. In addition, pro-
gressing through each level requires more work and more sophisticated data-
gathering techniques.
It is interesting to note that, although the number is increasing, many organi-
zations still only evaluate training at the first level. It is easiest but doesn’t
really give organizations what they need to measure the value of training.
Before you decide to conduct any type of evaluation, decide how you will use
the data. If you aren’t going to use it, don’t evaluate.
Level I: Reaction
Level I, or participant reaction data, measures participant satisfaction with
the training. The reaction to a training that is conducted externally by a con-
sultant or if the employee paid for the experience may be the deciding point
as to whether it will be repeated. If the training was presented internally, the
Level I evaluation provides guidance about what to change. This is true for
externally funded training as well, but sometimes, the provider doesn’t have
a chance to demonstrate improvements to the company. The employee’s
company will just not attend another training session. Most training efforts
are evaluated at this level.
253
Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!

Sometimes called smile sheets, Level I evaluation usually consists of a question-
naire that participants use to rate their level of satisfaction with the training
program and the trainer, among other things.
If you’re conducting a multiple-day training session, it is beneficial to evaluate
at the end of each day. If you’re conducting a one-day session, you may decide
to evaluate it halfway through. It benefits the trainer because it provides feed-
back to the trainer to allow adjustments to the design to better meet the par-
ticipants’ needs. It also benefits participants because it allows them to think
about what they learned and how they will apply it to their jobs.
Want to measure reaction at the end of day one and you do not have an eval-
uation form? Try one of these two ways. 
 First, use two flipchart pages. At the top of one write “positives” and at
the top of the other write “changes.” Then ask participants to provide
suggestions about what went well that day, the positives, and what
needs to change. Capture ideas as they are suggested. 
 A second one that I use regularly is to pass out an index card to each
participant. Ask them to anonymously rate the day on a 1 to 7 scale,
with 1 being low and 7 being high, and then to add one comment about
why they rated it at the level they did.
No attempt is made to measure behavioral change or performance improve-
ment. Nevertheless, Level I data does provide valuable information.
 It provides information about the trainer’s performance.
 It is an easy and economical process.
 If the tool is constructed well, the data can identify what needs to be
improved.
 The satisfaction level provides guidance to management about whether
to continue to invest in the training.
 If conducted immediately following the training session, the return rate
is generally close to 100 percent, providing a complete database.
Level II: Learning
Level II measures the extent to which learning has occurred. The measure-
ment of knowledge, skills, or attitude (KSAs) change indicates what partici-
pants have absorbed and whether they know how to implement what they
learned. Probably all training designs have at least one objective to increase
participant knowledge. Most training sessions also include objectives that
improve specific skills. And some training sessions such as diversity or team
building attempt to change attitudes.
254
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

The training design’s objectives provide an initial basis for what to evaluate in
Level II. This is the point at which trainers can find out not only how satisfied
the participants are, but what they can do differently as a result of the train-
ing. Tests, skill practices, simulations, group evaluations, role-plays, and other
assessment tools focus on what participants learned during the program.
Although testing is a natural part of learning, the word test often conjures up
stress and fears left over from bad experiences in school. Therefore, substi-
tute other words for tests or exams — even if testing is what you’re doing.
Measuring learning provides excellent data about what participants mastered
as a result of the training experience. This data can be used in several ways.
 A self-assessment for participants to compare what they gained as a
result of the training.
 An assessment of an employee’s knowledge and skills related to the job
requirements.
 If an attitude survey is conducted, it provides an indication of an
employee’s attitude about the content.
 An assessment of whether participants possess knowledge to safely per-
form their duties; this is especially critical in a manufacturing setting.
Level III: Behavior 
Level III evaluation measures whether the skills and knowledge are being
implemented. Are participants applying what they learned and transferring
what they learned to the job? 
Because this measurement focuses on changes in behavior on the job, it
becomes more difficult to measure for several reasons. First, participants
can’t implement the new behavior until they have an opportunity. In addition,
it is difficult to predict when the new behavior will be implemented. Even if
there is an opportunity, the learner may not implement the behavior at the
first opportunity. Therefore, timing becomes an issue for when to measure. 
To complicate things even more, the participant may have learned the behav-
ior and applied it on the job, but the participant’s supervisor would not allow
the behavior to continue. As a trainer, you hope that’s not happening, but
unfortunately it occurs more often than you want. This is when the training
department must ask itself whether the problem requires something other
than a training solution. Due to the nature of Level IIÎ evaluation, the mea-
sures may include the frequency and use of skills, with input on barriers and
enablers.
Measuring Levels I and II should occur immediately following the training,
but you can see why this would not be true for Level III. To conduct a Level III
evaluation correctly, you must find time to observe the participants on the
job, create questionnaires, speak to supervisors, and correlate data. You can
255
Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!

also see that even though measuring at Level III may be difficult, the benefits
of measuring behaviors are very clear.
 The measure may encourage a behavioral change on the job.
 When possible, Level III can be quantified and tied to other outcomes on
the job.
 When a lack of transfer of skills is clearly defined, it can clearly point to
a required training design change.
 A before and after measurement provides data that can be used to
understand other events.
 Sometimes, Level III evaluations help to determine the reasons change
has not occurred that are not related to training.
Level IV: Results
Level IV measures the business impact. Sometimes called cost-benefit analysis
(incorrectly) or return on investment, it determines whether the benefits from
the training were worth the cost of the training. At this level, the evaluation is
not accomplished through methods like those suggested in the previous
three levels. 
Results could be determined by factors such as reduced turnover, improved
quality, increased quantity or output, reduction of costs, increase in profits,
increased sales, improved customer service, reduction in waste or errors,
less absenteeism, or fewer grievances. You also need to determine the other
side of the equation, that is, how much the training costs to design and con-
duct as compared to the results. Identifying and capturing this data are rela-
tively easy. You would account for the cost of the trainer, materials and
equipment, travel for participants and the trainers, training space, and the
cost of having participants in a training session instead of producing the
organization’s services and products.
A cost-benefit analysis is usually completed before a training program is cre-
ated to decide whether it is worth the investment of resources required to
develop the program. Return on investment (ROI) is conducted after the train-
ing has been completed to determine whether it was worth the investment. 
Measurements focus on the actual results on the business as participants
successfully apply the program material. Typical measures may include
output, quality, time, costs, and customer satisfaction.

Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!
The training evaluation guru
by Dr. Donald Kirkpatrick
Yes, I am the one who originated and published
Evaluating Training Programs: The Four Levels.
And here is how it came about.
I was teaching at the University of Wisconsin
Management Institute, and I decided to obtain a
Ph.D. in the School of Education. My advisor
approved my dissertation, which was called
“Evaluating a Human Relations Training Program
For Supervisors.” I thought that as long as I was
teaching in the program, I may as well try to
evaluate the effectiveness. These were my
thoughts:
If I am going to evaluate, the first thing I am
interested in is “How do the participants feel
about the program?” After all, they are our cus-
tomers! I decided to call it REACTION.
My next thought was to try to measure to what
extent participants learned the three things we
were trying to teach: knowledge of manage-
ment principles and techniques; skill in knowing
such things as how to motivate and how to train
employees; whether or not they had changed
their attitudes about their company, their job, or
the challenges they face in applying what we
were teaching. So I decided to call that LEARN-
ING.
My third thought was to see to what extent they
applied what they had learned back on the job.
So I called it BEHAVIOR. And finally, I decided
to try to measure any results that came because
they attended this training program. I called it
RESULTS.
The editor of Training & Development magazine
from the American Society for Training and
Development (ASTD) asked me to write what
I had done. I decided to write a series of four
articles in 1959, with each article devoted to one
of the four “levels,” which they were beginning
to be called. Professional trainers read the arti-
cles, began to try them out, and passed the
word on to others in the training profession.
Many trainers wrote to me asking for a copy of
the articles. 
It wasn’t until 1993 that a professional friend,
Jane Holcomb, told me to write a book because
no one could find the articles any longer but
many were talking about the “four levels.” The
first edition of Evaluating Training Programs:
The Four Levels was published in 1994. A paper
edition was published several years later, and
the second edition was published in 1998 with
some new case studies. I decided to put some
case studies in Part 2 of the book so readers
could see how other organizations were apply-
ing the four levels. My first contact was with
Dave Basarab, an evaluation expert at
Motorola. When I told him who I was, he
replied, “Don Kirkpatrick! We use your four
levels all over the world!” My response was an
unbelieving, “You do?” He has not only written a
case study but also wrote the introduction to my
book.
Since then, the book has been published in
Spanish, Polish, and Turkish. And I was invited
to those countries to introduce the concepts,
principles, and techniques and autograph the
books. I have been asked to be a keynote
speaker for numerous national conferences and
many in-house programs.
People call me a “guru” or “legend,” but all I did
was come up with four practical and simple
ways to evaluate training programs. 
Author’s note: Dr. Kirkpatrick is currently work-
ing on another training evaluation book with his
son, Jim.

Guidelines for measuring the four levels
Now that I have given an overview of the four levels, I examine how you can
measure each of them. Methods for each level are presented along with
guidelines to consider as you develop your evaluation plan.
Measuring Level I
Level I, or reaction, can be easily measured during the training event or
immediately following it, preferably before participants leave the classroom.
A questionnaire, composed of both questions with a rating scale and open-
ended questions, is usually used. Most recently trainers have started to use
Webonnaires. The drawback is a lower return rate.
How do you begin? 
1. Determine what you want to learn about the training. 
You will most likely want to know something about the content including
its relevance to the participants’ jobs and the degree of difficulty. You
will also want to gather data about the trainer including effectiveness,
communication skills, the ability to answer questions, and approachabil-
ity.
2. Design a format that will be both easy for participants to complete
and presents a way for you to quantify participants’ responses. 
Many formats exist, and the design will be a factor of the first question —
What do you want to learn? You may choose to have statements rated on
a one- to seven-point scale representing strongly disagree to strongly
agree (or poor to excellent). You may also wish to ask open-ended ques-
tions, or you may choose to do a combination of both types of questions.
Even if you develop a format that has questions that are rated on a scale,
it is a good idea to add space at the end for comments.
3. Plan to obtain 100 percent response ratings that are complete. 
How do you accomplish all that? Most of it is in the timing. Ensure that
you plan time into the training design to complete the questionnaire.
Twenty minutes prior to the end of the training session, pass out the
evaluations and ask participants to complete them before you wrap up
for the day. Allowing time and letting them know there is more to come
encourages them to add comments. 
Trainers desire honest responses to their evaluations. To ensure honesty,
allow for anonymity. Don’t require participants to sign their evaluations. In
addition, ask them to drop the evaluations off on a table on their way out
versus leaving them at their places. If you have a valid reason for wanting to
know who made specific comments, for example, to provide feedback, you
may wish to make signing the evaluation optional.
258
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

Your training department will most likely have determined an acceptable
standard against which you will measure results. For example, 5.5 on a 7.0
scale may be considered acceptable by your training department.
If you follow these guidelines, you will be well on your way to finalizing an
effective Level I evaluation. A comprehensive training-competency checklist
can be found at the end of this chapter. You may want to use some aspects of
it to create your Level I evaluation. You and your colleagues may want to use
the evaluation to provide feedback to each other on your training skills.
There is a growing tendency for some training practitioners to snub Level I
evaluation as too insignificant or perfunctory. Perhaps this is because train-
ers can conduct more sophisticated evaluations or because it’s prudent to tie
training to the bottom line. The “smile sheet,” as Level I is known, has
become a pejorative term to some. Don’t fall into that way of thinking. Dr.
Kirkpatrick’s four levels are built upon each other. Level I is a prerequisite
when other levels are used. Even though you’re “only” measuring reactions,
these are the first-hand reactions of the customers of the training. There are
very few more-effective and efficient ways for trainers to obtain feedback
about performance. You may have the best training design, but if it is deliv-
ered poorly, it does affect participants’ ability to learn. Level I evaluation also
serves as a way to focus questions on the content. The key here is to design
an instrument that measures the essential foundation elements of the train-
ing content and how well it was delivered.
Hold on to your evaluations. Use the ideas and suggestions they contain to
improve your future performance and program designs. The evaluations
can also serve as input to your efforts to continually develop your skills and
competencies.
Measuring Level II
Level II, or learning, can be measured using self-assessments, facilitator
assessments, tests, simulations, case studies, and other exercises. This type
of evaluation should be conducted at the end of the training before partici-
pants leave to measure the degree to which the content was learned. Use pre-
and post-test results to compare improvement.
Measuring before and after the training session gives you the best data
because you will be able to compare the knowledge level prior to the session
and after the training has been completed. This is the best way to determine
whether participants gained knowledge or skills during the session. How do
you evaluate? Remember KSAs from the “Level II: Learning” section? That’s
what you will measure: the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that the training
session was designed to improve. Use tests to measure knowledge and atti-
tude surveys to measure changing attitudes. To measure skill acquisition, use
performance tests, where the participant is actually modeling the skill. Like
Level I, attempt to obtain a 100 percent response rate. 
259
Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!

Some trainers use a control group for comparison. And Dr. Kirkpatrick recom-
mends that you do so if it is practical. While this may be the most scientific
way to gather data, it may be wasted time. For example, if participants have
another way to learn between pre- and post-tests, then don’t send them to
training. On the other hand, if training is the only way that participants can
gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes, then why bother with a control
group? You’ll need to be your own judge about whether a control group is
beneficial.
Many types of testing formats exist from which to choose, and each brings
with it advantages and disadvantages. True/false tests are easy to develop
and cover many questions in a short amount of time. The drawback is that if
the test is too easy, having superficial knowledge may lead to an inflated
score. Be sure to use a subject matter expert (SME) to assist with the design.
Other options that exist include oral tests, essay tests, multiple-choice tests,
and measured simulations such as in-basket exercises, business games, case
studies, or role-plays. Assessments may also include self-assessments, team
assessments, or instructor assessments. A Web-based evaluation may also be
created. Although Web-based assessments are cost and time efficient, they
bring a couple problems including guaranteeing that participants are who
they say they are when signing in and the ability to protect the questions in
the exam banks. Most organizations using Web-based assessments have
addressed both of these issues. Whatever testing option you use, be sure that
the results are quantifiable.
Create straightforward tests. You’re not trying to trip up the participants.
You’re trying to measure the learning that occurred to ensure improved job
performance.
Finally, ensure that testing conditions are optimized by limiting noise, having
adequate lighting and comfortable temperature, and eliminating interrup-
tions. Be certain that the test is only as long as it needs to be. Be sure that
participants know the rules, such as whether it is acceptable to ask questions
during the test.
Pilot any test prior to using it with participants. Also, return measurement
results to employees as quickly as possible. The significance of measurement
feedback decreases with time.
Measuring Level III
Level III, or behavior, is used to determine the successful transfer of learning
to the workplace. Unlike Levels I and II, you need to allow time for the
changed behavior to occur. How much time? The experts differ, and with good
reason. The amount of time required for the change to manifest itself will be
260
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

dependent on the type of training, how soon the participant has an opportu-
nity to practice the skill, how long it takes participants to develop a new
behavioral pattern, and other aspects of the job. So, how long? Anywhere from
2 to 12 months. You will probably need to work with the subject matter expert
(SME) to determine the length of the delay required to allow participants an
opportunity to transfer the learning (behavior) to the job. 
By the way, like Level II, a pre- and post-testing method is recommended. And
again, the question of whether you want to incorporate a control group for
comparison needs to be decided.
What do you measure? Each item in an evaluation instrument should be
related to an objective taught as part of the training program. Based on the
training objectives, you will create a list of skills that describe the desired on-
the-job performance. Use an SME to assist you with the design of the evalua-
tion. The SME will understand the nuances of being able to complete a task.
For example, a skill may be “uses the four-step coaching model with employ-
ees.” An SME will know that even though the four steps are essential, what
truly makes the model successful is the supervisor’s “willingness to be avail-
able to respond to questions at any time.” Knowing this, your checklist of
skills will be expanded to include availability.
After you have identified the skills to measure, select an evaluation method.
Evaluation tools may include interviews, focus groups, on-site observations,
follow-up questionnaires, customer surveys, and colleague or supervisory
input.
Level III evaluation should not be taken lightly. It takes a major resource
investment. Know what you will measure; know how you will measure; and
most important, know how you will use the data.
All trainers should be skilled in Level III evaluation methods. The most
common reason for conducting training is to improve performance due to
knowledge and skills transfer, as well as attitude changes. Results cannot be
expected unless a positive change in behavior occurs. Therefore, use Level III
evaluation to measure the extent to which a change in behavior occurs.
What do you do if the results show that performance has not been changed
or skills mastered? You need to go back to the training design. Certainly the
first step is to determine whether the skill is required. If yes, you want to
examine the training material to ensure that appropriate learning techniques
have been used and that enough emphasis has been placed on the skill.
Perhaps a job aid is required to improve performance. Sometimes, you may
discover something that did not show up in the needs assessment. For exam-

longer important or is not frequently used on the job. In that case, you may

want to remove it from the training session. This is a perfect example of how
the fifth stage of The Training Cycle feeds back into the first stage.
Getting results that show that performance has not improved is not what a
trainer wants to hear. However, it is good to have the knowledge to make an
intelligent decision about whether to maintain the training program, overhaul
it, or scrap it entirely. Without a Level III evaluation, you would not likely be
able to make a wise decision.
Measuring Level IV
Level IV, or results, may be the most difficult to measure. Dr. Kirkpatrick
states that the most frequently asked question he gets is “How do you evalu-
ate Level IV?” Even though Level IV is the most challenging, training profes-
sionals need to be able to demonstrate that training is valuable and can
positively affect the bottom line.
One of the issues of evaluating at this level is that you can never be sure
whether external factors affected the business. There is always a possibility
that something other than the on-the-job application contaminated the results.
Can you really isolate the effects training has on business results? This is one
time that using a control group can be helpful to the evaluation results. Yet
even with a control group there may be other factors that impact the business,
such as the loss of a good customer, the introduction of a new competitor, a
new hiring practice, or the economy. Several statistical methods are available
to you to consider other evidence. I don’t cover them in this book. 
So what do you do when management asks you to provide tangible evidence
that training is having positive results? A before-and-after measurement is rel-
atively easy because records for the kinds of things you measure (turnover,
sales, expenses, errors, grievances) are generally available. The trick is to
determine which figures are meaningful. 
The second difficultly is predicting the amount of time that should be allowed
for the change to take effect. It may be anywhere between 9 and 18 months.
Gather the data that you believe provides evidence of the impact of the train-
ing. This measurement usually extends beyond the training department and
utilizes tools that measure business performance, such as sales, expenses, or
rework. Remember, a key issue is to try to isolate training’s impact on results.
You may not be able to prove beyond a doubt that training has had a positive
business impact, but you will be able to produce enough evidence so that
management can make the final decision.
You’ve read in this book and other places that training should align with the
business’s requirements. How do you do that? Dr. Kirkpatrick suggests that
his evaluation levels can be used. Start with Level IV. Determine, with the
business managers, what needs to occur (results). Next decided what perfor-
mance (behaviors, or Level III) are required to achieve the desired results.
262
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

Then identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs, or Level II) employees
require to achieve performance expectations. Finally, create a plan to offer the
correct training, ensuring employees will be receptive to the changes.
Which evaluation level to use?
You may choose to evaluate training at one or all levels. How do you decide?
Base your decision on answers to the following questions.
 What is the purpose of the training?
 How will you use the results of the evaluation?
 What changes or improvements may be made as a result of the 
evaluations?
 Who are the stakeholders and what do they want you to measure?
 Is the training expected to impact business goals?
 What resources will be required for the evaluation?
Just because there are four evaluation levels doesn’t mean that you should
use all four. After answering the preceding questions, decide which levels will
be the most beneficial for each training. Evaluation experts agree that Level
III and especially Level IV should be used sparingly due to the time and cost
involved. A rule of thumb seems to be use Level IV in those situations where
the results are a top organizational priority or for training that is expensive.
Evaluation methods
I have presented a number of evaluation methods in this chapter. In this sec-
tion, I examine some of these and discuss the advantages and disadvantages
to help you choose the one that will work best. 
Objective test formats
This method measures how well trainees learn program content. An instruc-
tor administers paper-and-pencil or computer tests in class to measure par-
ticipants’ progress. The test should measure the learning specified in the
objective. Tests should be valid and reliable. Valid means that an item mea-
sures what it is supposed to measure; reliable means that the test gives con-
sistent results from one application to another.
 Multiple-choice questions take time and consideration to prepare.
However, they maximize test-item discrimination yet minimize the accu-
racy of guessing. They provide an easy format for the participants and
an easy method for scoring.
 True-false tests are more difficult to write than you may imagine. They
are easy to score.
263
Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!

 Matching tests are easy to write and to score. They require a minimum
amount of writing but still offer a challenge.
 Fill-in-the-blank or short-answer questions require knowledge without
any memory aids. A disadvantage is that scoring may not be as objective
as you may think. If the questions do not have one specific answer, the
scorer may need to be more flexible than originally planned. Guessing is
reduced because there are no choices available.
 Essays are the most difficult to score, although they do measure
achievement at a higher level than any of the other paper-and-pencil
tests. Scoring is the most subjective.
Attitude surveys
These question-and-answer surveys determine what changes in attitude have
occurred as a result of training. Practitioners use these surveys to gather
information about employees’ perceptions, work habits, motivation, values,
beliefs, and working relations. Attitude surveys are more difficult to con-
struct because they measure less tangible items. There is also the potential
for participants to respond with what they perceive is the “right” answer.
Simulation and on-site observation
Instructors’ or managers’ observations of performance on the job or in a job
simulation indicate whether a learner is demonstrating the desired skills as a
result of the training. Facilitate this process by developing a checklist of the
desired behaviors. This is sometimes the only way to determine whether
skills have transferred to the workplace. Some people panic or behave differ-
ently if they think they are being observed. Observations of actual perfor-
mance or simulated performance can be time-consuming. It also requires a
skilled observer to decrease subjectivity.
Criteria checklists
Also called performance checklists or performance evaluation instruments, cri-
teria checklists are surveys using a list of performance objectives required to
evaluate observable performance. The checklists may be used in conjunction
with observations.
Productivity or performance reports 
Hard production data such as sales reports and manufacturing totals can
help managers and instructors determine actual performance improvement
on the job. An advantage of using productivity reports is that no new evalua-
tion tool must be developed. The data is quantifiable. Disadvantages include
a lack of contact with the participant and records that may be incomplete.
264
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

Post-training surveys 
Progress and proficiency assessments by both managers and participants
indicate perceived performance improvement on the job. Surveys may not be
as objective as necessary.
Needs/objectives/content comparison 
Training managers, participants, and supervisors compare needs analysis
results with course objectives and content to determine whether the pro-
gram was relevant to participants’ needs. Relevancy ratings at the end of the
program also contribute to the comparison. 
Evaluation forms 
Sometimes called a response sheet, participants respond on end-of-program
evaluation forms to indicate what they liked and disliked about the training
delivery, content, logistics, location, and other aspects of the training experi-
ence. The form lets participants know that their input is desired. Both quanti-
tative and qualitative data can be gathered. 
Interviews
Interviews can be used to determine the extent to which skills and knowledge
are being used on the job. They may also uncover constraints to implementa-
tion. Like no other method, interviews convey interest, concern, and empathy
in addition to collecting data. They are useful when it isn’t possible to observe
behaviors directly. The interviewer becomes the evaluation tool, and this can
be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Interviews are more costly than
other methods, but they give instant feedback, and the interviewer has the
ability to probe for more information.
Instructor evaluation 
Professional trainers administer assessment sheets and evaluation forms to
measure the instructor’s competence, effectiveness, and instructional skills.
See an example at the end of this chapter.
All of these evaluation methods work. All give you the information you need.
Some work better than others for each of the four levels. The final decision
about which method to use will be yours. 
It is easy to grow accustomed to your favorite evaluation method. It is much
better to incorporate variety in the evaluation methods used. Gaining exper-
tise with several makes you more skilled in knowing which method will be
best for each situation, and is an important aspect for achieving certification.

Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!

Discussions with employees on an individual basis can give insight into the
effectiveness of the training session. Are there things you’re doing differently
as a result of participating in the training program? Have you noticed changes
in your attitudes or relationships that may be related to the training program?
ROI: What’s All the Hype?
In recent years a fifth level has been added to Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of
Evaluation: return on investment (ROI). Trainers face a persistent trend to
be more accountable and to prove their worth — the return on the dollars
invested in training. Dr. Jack Phillips has been credited with the development
of this fifth level of training evaluation. 
As you read more about evaluation, you may see the term ROI used in con-
junction with Level IV evaluation. The main difference at the fifth level is how
the data is presented. ROI, by definition, is expressed as a percent in Level V.
Level V: Return on investment
This ROI measurement compares the monetary benefits of the training pro-
gram with the cost of the program. Few organizations conduct evaluations at
this level. The current estimates appear to be somewhere between 10 and 20
percent. Even if organizations do evaluate training at Level V, many limit its
use only to those training programs that:
 Are expensive
 Are high visibility and/or important to top management
 Involve a large population
 Are linked to strategic goals and operational objectives
Although many organizations claim to want to know more about training’s
ROI, few seem to be willing to make the investment required to gather and
analyze the data.
What’s the ROI process?
ROI presents a process that produces the value-added contribution of train-
ing in a corporate-friendly format. The ROI process consists of five steps.
Note that Levels I through IV are essential for gathering the initial data.
266
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

1. Collect post-program data. 
A variety of methods, similar to those identified in the last section, are
used to collect Level I through Level IV data.
2. Isolate the effects of training. 
Many factors may influence performance data; therefore, steps must be
taken to pinpoint the amount of improvement that can be attributed
directly to the training program. A comprehensive set of tools is used
that may include a control group, trend line analysis, forecasting models,
and impact estimates from various groups.
3. Convert data to a monetary value. 
Assess the Level IV data and assign a monetary value. Techniques may
include using historical costs, using salaries and benefits as value for time,
converting output to profit contributions, or using external databases.
4. Tabulate program costs. 
Identifying the program costs include at least the cost to design and
develop the program, materials, facilitator salary, facilities, travel,
administrative costs and overhead, and the cost of participants who
attend the program.
5. Calculate the ROI. 
The ROI is calculated by dividing the net program benefits (program
benefits less program costs) by the program costs times 100. In this
step, you also identify intangible benefits, such as increased job satisfac-
tion, improved customer service, and reduced complaints.
Although it feels like a great deal of work, it will be worth it if you need to
provide evidence to management regarding the value of training. 
Benefits of adding a Level V
Given the extra effort, it’s worth examining the benefits of adding a fifth level
of evaluation.
Probably the most important one is to respond to management’s question of
whether training adds value to the organization. The ROI calculations convince
management that training is an investment, not an expense. The ROI analysis
also provides information about specific training programs: Which ones con-
tributed the most to the bottom line; which ones need to be improved; and
which ones are an expense to the organization. When the training practitioner
acts on this data, the process has the added benefit of improving the effective-
ness of all training programs.
Level V evaluations, ROI, provide an essential aspect of the entire evaluation
process.

Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 
An interview with Jack Phillips
Q: Jack, it is exciting to be interviewing you.
Can you provide readers with some back-
ground on ROI?
JP: We developed a systematic and practical
way to show value for learning and develop-
ment. Building on Kirkpatrick’s four levels, we
added a fifth level for ROI. In addition, we made
adjustments in the definition to be more applic-
able across all types of programs. We added a
process model to show how data are collected
and converted to monetary value and costs are
captured to generate the actual return on
investment. One of the most important contri-
butions is the variety of methods to isolate the
effects of learning on actual business impact
data. This is the most critical step to ensure
credibility in an impact study. 
Finally, we developed standards for the process
and focused on how organizations can imple-
ment the methodology based on the assumption
that the best model in the world is not going to be
used routinely if it’s not feasible, practical, ratio-
nal, and logical. Much of our work is focused on
helping others with implementation — the basis
for our certification in the ROI methodology.
Q: How was ROI was developed? What’s the
real story?
JP: My interest in ROI stems initially from my
interest and background in quantitative meth-
ods. With undergraduate degrees in electrical
engineering, math, and physics and a master’s
in statistics, my personality and interest lie in
bottom-line accountability (my Myers Briggs is
ISTJ). In 1973, I conducted my first impact study
as part of my master’s thesis, where I calculated
the return on investment for a co-op program at
Lockheed Martin (I was the co-op Director). 
My next ROI study (1976) was conducted on
supervisor training. As training manager, I con-
ducted this study in my organization at the sug-
gestion of a senior executive who wanted to
know more about the impact of training. While
we continued to improve, expand, and speak
about ROI, I continued to use it internally as an
HR executive and ultimately in a banking orga-
nization where I served as President and Chief
Operating Officer. 
Initially, I developed the ROI process using con-
cepts from finance and accounting as well as
some of the processes from re-engineering and
the total quality movement. The process was
built on the foundation of Kirkpatrick’s four
levels with an added fifth level. I thought the fifth
level was necessary to show the ultimate
accountability of comparing the monetary value
of learning to the actual costs. More important,
we developed a process model, created stan-
dards, and focused on implementation.
Q: What inspired you to develop a process for
measuring ROI?
JP: The initial executive reaction from the
second ROI study not only inspired me to con-
tinue working with the process on my own work
but to also spread the word to others. I began
by speaking occasionally, writing articles, and
publishing. In 1982, I published my first book,
Handbook of Training and Evaluation and
Measurement Methods, which advocated ROI.
Incidentally, this was the first major evaluation
book in the United States and is now in its third
edition with Butterworth-Heinemann. I contin-
ued to see positive reaction and began publish-
ing additional materials. The reaction was
overwhelming. My Ph.D. dissertation in the
1980s focused on this issue as well, digging into
the issue from a research perspective. 
By the early ’90s, it was clear to me that there
was a need for public workshops and consult-
ing on this methodology. To our knowledge,
there were no one- or two-day workshops on
training evaluation. At the end of 1992, I
launched the process globally, conducting our

269
Chapter 13: Evaluation: It’s Not Over Yet!
first two-day workshop in Johannesburg, South
Africa. Since then, over 500 two-day workshops
have been conducted with 15,000 participants;
and over 130 one-week certification workshops
have been conducted, involving over 2,000 par-
ticipants. Its use and adoption throughout the
world (in 40 countries) and the continuing feed-
back we get on this methodology keep inspiring
me and our team to continue our work.
Q: Trainers seem to shy away from ROI. Why
does that happen?
JP: There is both good and bad news here. First,
as indicated above, there is a widespread adop-
tion of ROI. We think that some 15 to 20 percent
of training organizations in the USA are using
this methodology in some way. Still, that leaves
a lot of organizations that do not use ROI. We
think some of the primary reasons are as follows:
 Many of the trainers have a fear of mathe-
matics and statistics and equate the ROI
methodology with mathematics. (This is
often a myth and not necessarily the case.)
 There’s a fear of ROI because it may expose
a program or project that is not working
well. If a program is ineffective, the last
thing a trainer would want to do is publish a
report indicating that it’s not delivering the
value.
 This process is very client driven. The
trainer must work closely with management
groups. Some trainers do not want to do
that and will even avoid interaction with the
management group.
 Trainers do not use ROI because they are
concerned about the resources required —
both time and money — to make it a reality.
(This is often based on a myth and not 
reality.)
 Trainers don’t know what ROI is all about
and they lack the skills, insight, and knowl-
edge to implement it. The unknown breeds
uncertainty, which breeds resistance.
Q: Under what conditions should trainers and
training departments be concerned about using
ROI?
JP: Trainers should be concerned about ROI
from three different viewpoints. 
 A defensive posture: You have to be con-
cerned about ROI when there’s a need to
justify the budget (or avoid budget cuts) or
justify a program (or avoid having a pro-
gram cut). The ROI methodology provides
data about value, and it’s the best way that
we know to show the value of learning 
programs.
 A responsive posture: Trainers should be
concerned about ROI if they want to be
responsible for making a contribution to an
organization. Every professional employee
should be held accountable for his or her
work. 
 A proactive posture: More trainers these
days are concerned about ROI because
they want to be proactive, take the lead,
and show the value with data that man-
agers appreciate and respect. It’s very self-
satisfying to see the contribution you’ve
made to the organization, and particularly
satisfying for all the stakeholders involved. 
Q: Any last words of advice, Jack?
JP: It’s important to note that ROI should be
used only on programs that are very expensive,
strategic, involve a large number of employees,
have high visibility, or attract management
interest. Collectively, these criteria tell us when
to use this process.

Evaluation: The Last Training Cycle
Stage but the First Step to Improvement 
Bringing a chapter that could be as big as a book to a close can be difficult.
I am delighted that, if you chose to read the entire chapter, you were able
to read comments directly from the two evaluation experts, Drs. Kirkpatrick
and Phillips. Both recognize the value that evaluation holds for making
improvements.
You may now be ready to put your evaluation plan together. If so, don’t be
shy about asking for outside assistance. Statisticians and researchers and
other consultants will be able to expedite a process that will meet your stake-
holders’ needs.
As a trainer, the Level I evaluations are important to you. Don’t ignore the
feedback. Another practice you should consider is to ask a training colleague
to conduct a peer review. Do you have a colleague whose opinion you value?
Ask the individual to observe one of your programs — even a portion is help-
ful. Another trainer will observe things and give you feedback on techniques
that participants may overlook.
I am delighted to share with you one of the most comprehensive trainer-
competency checklists I’ve seen in Table 13-1. Copy it and ask a colleague
for input on your next training session.

Evaluation is the final stage in The Training Cycle, but it is certainly only the
beginning of improving training. It will be up to you to take your training
efforts to the next level relying on evaluation to help you decide what to
improve. In Dr. Kirkpatrick’s words, “Evaluation is a science and an art. It is
a blend of concepts, theory, principles, and techniques. It is up to you to do
the application.”

Transfer of Learning
In This Chapter
 Discovering how to follow-up with your participants
 Overcoming barriers to transfer learning to the workplace
 Recognizing the importance of planning for transfer
 Learning what great trainers do after training
“W
ell, that was a great training session; now back to work!” Ever
heard a colleague say something like this upon returning from a
training session? I have left training with a big binder filled with good ideas.
Because work piled up while I was gone, I place the training binder on the
side of my desk, promising myself that I would look at it later and implement
what I learned. Later came and went, and soon I moved the binder to a shelf
next to lots of other binders filled with good ideas. Why does this happen?
And when you are the one in the training role, is that what you want to
occur? Of course not! But it takes a team effort to ensure that learning trans-
fers to the workplace.
The supervisors, learners, and trainers form a team right from the start to
ensure that learning and skills transfer from the training session to the work-
place. You know that the pre-training activities are often more critical than
the post-training activities in ensuring success. That means planning to
ensure transfer should occur as soon as possible. Follow-up actions are
useful, to be certain. Just remember that even though transfer of learning
occurs after the training session, it is by then too late to plan for it.
This chapter addresses the barriers to transfer of learning and the impor-
tance of planning for the transfer. It will also provide suggestions and tips for
what trainers can do following a training session.

Making Your Training Memorable:
Following-Up
An issue cited by trainers since the beginning of time is that the concepts
learned in the classroom may not transfer to the job. The training experience
becomes a void — an isolated experience that has no practical application in
the real world. 
Dana and Jim Robinson have been expressing concern regarding the lack of
training transfer to the workplace for years. Trainers need to examine the
entire system from an organizational perspective. The reason that learning
does not transfer could be organizational (policies, negative consequences),
lack of management support, or that the learner lacks the required equip-
ment, supplies, or support system. Therefore, it may not have been a training
problem in the first place. 
However, assume you conducted a great needs assessment and were correct
in identifying a training problem. Yet the training did not transfer. Consider
some barriers (see the following section) that may prevent an effective trans-
fer of learning, as well as some steps a trainer can take to overcome these
barriers during the design phase.
Note: This section can be placed anywhere in the Training Cycle because
transfer of learning starts with the needs assessment to ensure that there
really is a training problem and ends with implementation back on the job. I’ve
written a specific chapter to give it the emphasis it needs. However, because
you know there is a need for follow-up at the design stage, be sure to build in
the strategies you need at that time.
Barriers to transfer of learning
It is unfortunate, but true: Many barriers exist that prevent learning from
transferring to the job.
 It is difficult for participants to change their behavior, so they revert to
old habits on the job.
 Participants may be the only ones practicing the new behavior. Peer
pressure may cause them to reject the new learning.
 The participants’ supervisors may not understand the new knowledge,
skills, or behaviors; therefore, they do not support or reinforce them.
 The participants’ supervisors may not agree with the new knowledge,
skills, or behaviors; therefore, they may undermine them.
 The participants’ supervisors may not be proper role models for the
new knowledge, skills, or behaviors.

Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

 The informal organizational culture may punish the new behavior. For
example, I once worked with an organization that made coded locking
systems. They found that their return rate was increasing. They found
that the returned systems were defective due to production errors; for
example, parts were missing, assembly was incorrect. They thought
they needed to retrain all their assembly people. Instead, what they
needed to do was to change their compensation system. Employees
were paid by the number of systems they shipped on a daily basis, not
by the quality of the final product. Of course one would expect employ-
ees to work as quickly as they could as opposed to as accurately as they
could work.
Strategies for transfer of learning
Even though some barriers may be out of your hands, you can do your part
as a trainer to ensure transfer of training. Although the transfer of training
occurs after the actual session, remind yourself of what can be done before
the training occurs and during the training session. 
A comprehensive study about training transfer (Broad, M. & Newstrom,
J.,Transfer of Training, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1992) notes that while
post-training strategies are important to training transfer, the greater impact
is actually in pre-training aspects.
Pre-training strategies
Trainers can implement numerous strategies before the training even begins
to ensure that training transfers to the workplace.
 Conduct a needs assessment: Make sure the training you provide is
derived from a well-conducted and -analyzed needs assessment. Be cer-
tain the training is aligned with the organization’s strategic plan.
 Coach the management team: If managers have requested specific train-
ing for their employees, meet with the managers to gain specific informa-
tion from them, as well as to let them know exactly what their roles will
be in supporting and reinforcing the training. This is a good time to pre-
qualify managers to determine how supportive they are of the upcoming
training. Encourage them to meet with the learners to prepare them for
why attending this training is important. 
 Inform managers about the training: Provide management briefings
about the training. Inform them about how the training supports the
organizational goals. Let these folks know the objectives, the expected
outcomes, and the expected benefits. Alert management to any organiza-
tional or top management barriers that may adversely affect the desired
outcome. Engage the managers in resolving the barriers and get their
commitment to support the group’s solution.

Chapter 14: Transfer of Learning

 Provide pre-training projects: Get participants and their managers
involved in the training concepts before the training begins. You can do
this by having them complete instruments or surveys that will, in turn,
be used as resource material or data in the actual training program.
Training strategies — during the session
Trainers can utilize numerous strategies during the session to ensure that
training transfers to the workplace.
 Practical application: Make sure that every topic you cover in the train-
ing is job related and has a specific “real world” application.
 Use actual examples: When conducting role-plays, simulations, and
other activities, use actual data and experiences.
 Build in plenty of practice opportunities: After you know the knowl-
edge and skills required of the learners, design activities that include
practice with feedback.
 Poll expectations: Before conducting the training program, poll the
expectations of the participants to assure you are providing them with
the skills and information they need. Build in the “what’s in it for me?”
 Include transfer to the job in debriefings: When you debrief on any
activity, make sure you include a discussion of how participants can
apply the lessons of the activity to their jobs.
 Encourage follow-up actions: Participants can fortify and augment what
they learned by tapping in to additional resources from a list that you
provide. They can also schedule an “appointment” with themselves to
review their notes. They could plan to discuss with their bosses how
they will implement what they learned.
 Create a reminder: Participants can note their primary goals in their
PDAs or other locations where they will see them often. They could also
write them on index cards and place them in a conspicuous place at
home, work, or in their cars.
 Action plan: After the training has been conducted, have participants
list what they are going to do on the job as a result of training. Discuss
participants’ ideas with the entire group.
A self memo is a unique action planning tool. I’ve used this tool for many
years and participants still love it. Have participants write themselves a
memo during the training session and place it in a self-addressed, stamped
envelope. Then mail it back to them in four to eight weeks. See Figure 14-1 as
an example.
278
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

Post-training strategies
To transition learners from “I tried it” to “I’ll apply it” requires trainers to
design follow-up activities and provide tools to both the learner and the
supervisor. In order for learning to transfer, the participant must be commit-
ted to the change. In addition, the supervisor must provide the learner with
support. The trainer must support both the learner and the supervisor. 
These suggestions identify strategies that you can use to ensure that the
learners apply what they learn.
 Follow-up letters, e-mails, or phone calls from the trainer: A few weeks
after the program is completed, the trainer may write follow-up letters
or make phone calls. The communication can remind participants of
some of the concepts and ask how they are doing in applying them. The
phone call has the advantage of being interactive. It allows participants
to share barriers they are experiencing and to get ideas from the trainer
to overcome them. The trainer can assist learners with dealing with
change. See the sidebar.
 Follow-up sharing: When you follow up with participants, track what
you learn. If someone asks a practical question that was not covered in
the training, or if the same question comes up several times, take note.
Share this information with everyone in the class via an e-mail. 
Write yourself a memo, committing to at least three things you'd like to do as a
result of this training program. Sign it, insert it in the envelope, address it to
yourself, and we will mail it back for your review in six weeks.

Chapter 14: Transfer of Learning

You may wish to credit one of the participants with follow-up: “Dan
brought to my attention that we did not _______.” This will encourage
others to bring these things to your attention.
 Support groups: The trainer can encourage participants to form support
groups. To do this, a small group of people can commit to meeting after
a specified period of time. When they meet they can discuss how they
have applied the learning, what problems they have encountered, and
what they have done to overcome the problems. 
 Reunion: If support groups do not appeal to the participants, you can
call for a reunion. Have participants demonstrate how they are imple-
menting what they learned in the workplace. 
I’ve heard of some groups who were so dedicated to reconnecting with
the other participants that they met after work.
 Past participants as mentors: Match participants who have attended
the training in the past with participants who have just completed the
session. If at all possible bring them into the classroom at some point
during the session to meet each other.
 Practice sessions: The trainer can encourage participants to plan one or
two practice sessions. You can even volunteer to facilitate them. The
purpose would be to have participants reconvene after having had some
time on the job to practice the skills. They could then practice the next
higher level of that skill, get feedback, and make a new commitment to
continuous learning.
 Other feedback: Think about other ways to gather data about the suc-
cess of the session. For example, if you taught a computer class, you can
check the help desk calls immediately after the session to determine if
there are references to your session. If there are, it means that learning
did not occur. Perhaps there is a better method to use next time.
Set up an electronic bulletin board for participants to share successes,
ask questions, or just to stay in touch in general.
 Job aids: Job aids are short, written guides or check sheets that summa-
rize the steps to a task or job procedure. They may also be performance
support systems (PSS) or posters that can be taken back to the work-
place. They serve as reminders to the participants after the training has
been completed. They are especially useful after a skill training program.
However, job aids can also be effective in reminding participants of key
behavioral concepts. 
 Management support and coaching: The best way to assure post-training
application is to have participants’ managers provide support and coach-
ing. A trainer may provide a sheet of coaching tips to managers and then
follow up to offer assistance to them in the coaching process. 
280
Part IV: It’s Not Over Yet: The Follow-Up 

 Meetings with managers: Three to four weeks following the session
meet with the managers in person to determine whether the training
addressed the needs and whether the employees are applying the skills
and knowledge. You may also use this time to determine what other
needs could be addressed in the future.
What Great Trainers Do After Training
Many of the same strategies that you use with participants are things that
you can do yourself to ensure continuous improvement. For example, you
could write yourself a memo, committing yourself to at least two things you’d
like to do better as a result of facilitating your session. Sign it, insert it in an
envelope, address it to yourself, and ask someone to mail it back for your
review in a month. When it arrives, it will be a reminder of what you were
supposed to have accomplished.
Make a habit of reviewing your training notes immediately after the session
and make additions or changes while it is all fresh in your mind.
Be sure to study the evaluations. What suggestions do the participants have
for you? What can you do differently next time, based on the feedback? Review
several sets of evaluations to determine if there are any trends. If so, what are
they and do they require any changes on your part or to the materials?
281
Chapter 14: Transfer of Learning
Assisting learners with change
Remember that adults carry with them strong
opinions and points of view. Don’t be discour-
aged when you discover how slowly change
occurs. These tips may help you assist learners
with change.
 Listen to the learner’s concerns and
acknowledge that they are legitimate.
 Help the learner understand why the
change is occurring.
 Discuss the benefit of the change with the
learner.
 Determine the values held by the learner
and, if applicable, demonstrate that these
values are not threatened.
 Problem-solve with the learner to identify
choices.
 Assure learners they will receive encour-
agement and support in attempting to
change — then make sure you live up to
your promise.

Follow-up with the participants, sending them any materials that you promised
you would send. This is a great opportunity to find out how they are doing and
how you may be able to help them transfer the skills.
If you do not have a Smile File, start one today. A Smile File is a place where
you can keep all your kudos. If you did a great job facilitating, you are sure to
receive notes, e-mails, and cards complimenting you on something special or
thanking you for going out of your way. Your Smile File will be useful when
you are having a difficult day. You can pull it out and read the wonderful
things participants have said in the past. That will make it all worthwhile.
Connect with the participants’ supervisors relatively soon after the training
session. Remind them of how they can support their employees. This may be
a time to share a “cheat sheet” with them. You could provide a list of the con-
cepts taught, questions that could be asked, or suggestions for how to help
learners implement the skills or use the knowledge.
If the training session will be ongoing, consider conducting a focus group
with several key supervisors to obtain feedback before conducting the train-
ing again. They can tell you what skills seem to be transferring and which are
not. They may also be able to provide you with other insight to improve the
training session. 
There are many other things you could do following training. I think this is
enough to get you started. Although short, this chapter is a critical consider-
ation for all trainers. Transfer of learning and transfer of skills beyond the
classroom are why you are in business. In this fast-moving world, it would be
easier to “call it quits” at the end of the training session. A trainer — a great
trainer — makes certain that follow-up activities are completed to ensure
transfer of learning has occurred.
As you leave this chapter, remember the words of one of the pioneers in the
training profession, Robert Mager, who stated in his book Making Instruction
Work: “If it’s worth teaching, it’s worth finding out whether the instruction
was successful. If it wasn’t entirely successful, it’s worth finding out how to
improve it.”

The Professional
Trainer

In this part . . .
You have a chance to explore the professional aspects
of being a trainer. How can you constantly upgrade
your skills? How do you become certified by the American
Society for Training and Development (ASTD)? What issues
exist in the profession that you should have knowledge
about? This part answers those questions.

Chapter 15
The Consummate Professional
In This Chapter
 Knowing what it takes to be a professional trainer
 Becoming a lifelong learner
 Maintaining your energy level
 Giving back to the profession
W
hat does it take to be a model of success and professionalism as a
trainer? Probably the same thing it takes to be a model of success in
any vocation, whether it’s ballet, soccer, chemistry, plumbing, teaching, or
writing. I once read that most people achieve only a third of their potential.
Successful professionals in any field achieve more than a third of their poten-
tial because they work at it.
How can trainers maintain a professional edge? Professional trainers can
become lifelong learners; they go the extra mile to be better than average;
and they give back to the profession. Each of these topics is addressed in this
chapter. In addition, you will not want to miss Bob Pike’s thoughts about
what it takes to be a master trainer.
Become a Lifelong Learner
You have an obligation to your participants and employer to continually
improve your knowledge and skills. The rapid changes in the world today can
turn today’s expert into tomorrow’s dolt if the person fails to keep up.
Trainers create their own development plan to ensure that they are lifelong
learners. Several strategies can be included in a development plan.
Attend formal learning events
Probably the first thing you think about when becoming a lifelong learner is
“What class or conference can I attend?”

Go back to school
You may not need an MBA, but courses at the graduate level are critical. Take
courses in finance or marketing or organizational development so that you
can continue to be a strong contributor to your organization. Take a class to
bring yourself up to speed in the technology area. Take an adult-learning
class as a refresher or to get another perspective.
Check your local community colleges and universities. Many have continuing
educational programs that may offer topics to help you grow. I’ve benefited
from programs such as “Dealing with Difficult People,” “Project Management,”
and “Learning to Be More Creative.”
Consider certification
Certification confers valuable credibility to anyone in the profession. The
American Society for Training and Development has responded to the grow-
ing demand for credentialing. It initiated a certification program in 2005
based on the 2004 Competency Study. Certification benefits trainers by offer-
ing a means to prove their value and identify a path of continued professional
development. 
Seminars and workshops are available to help individuals prepare for certifi-
cation. The next chapter discusses certification for trainers and others in the
broader field of Workplace Learning and Performance. 
Attend conferences
At the very least consider attending your professional organization’s annual
conference. It may be expensive, but you owe it to yourself to invest in your
development. Sometimes local chapters also present conferences or daylong
seminars. All of these add to your knowledge and skill base.
To get the most out of these events, network with others. Trade business
cards. Offer to exchange information or resources. At least as much learning
occurs during the breaks and informal networking opportunities as occurs
during the formal sessions.
If you network with many folks, jot a note on the back of each business card
to remind yourself about the topic, what you were to send, or why you want
to stay in touch with the person.
Enroll in a train-the-trainer, preferably one in which you are videotaped and
obtain feedback on your training style.
Ask others
Many other learning experiences exist, if you just ask.
286
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

Join an association or a group
Toastmasters, National Speaker Association (NSA), The American Society for
Training and Development (ASTD), International Society for Performance
Improvement (ISPI), and others are great groups for you to join. They provide
opportunities for you to learn new skills, to stay on top of the latest happen-
ings in the profession, and to network with others in the training profession.
Go to the Training For Dummies resource list at www.ebbweb.com to learn
more about these and other groups. Find a chapter in your area. All will invite
you to attend a trial meeting to determine if the group is right for you.
Create mentoring opportunities
Identify another trainer whom you respect and would like as a mentor. Ask
the person if that would be possible. My mentor and I meet for breakfast four
to six times each year. I pay for our meals. This has become the best $10
investment I make. I’m investing in myself.
Determine where the experts hang out. Then go there. Sometimes this is a
related association or an informal group. More-seasoned people and those
with different experiences can offer you priceless advice and knowledge.
Train with a partner
Training with a partner is a unique way to learn from someone else. It allows
you to observe another trainer, elicit feedback about your efforts, and learn
new techniques and skills. Even if you do not co-facilitate, invite other col-
leagues to observe you during a training session. Ask them to notice specific
aspects of your training and solicit their input after the session.
Do it yourself
You don’t have to wait for a class or a conference or a meeting to learn. You
can establish your own pace by reading books and journals. 
Read
I recently designed a training certificate program for ASTD. As a part of my
data gathering, I asked top training professionals what they did to maintain
their expertise. Everyone stated that they read. And they didn’t just read a
book or two. They read lots! They devoured the printed word. Some sub-
scribed to (and read) dozens of journals and magazines. Others read
upwards of 20 books every month. This behavior represents the experts
in our profession; they must be on to something!
Subscribe to and read professional journals such as Training Magazine and
T&D Journal. Read general business magazines such as Fortune, Business
287
Chapter 15: The Consummate Professional

Week, and the Harvard Business Review. Read the journals published by your
company’s or your client’s industry. And read cutting-edge journals such as
Fast Company.
Identify resources
Many other resources exist. Sign up for an online service. The World Wide
Web is a dynamic source for professional development resources. Sites pro-
vide information as well as link you to other related sites.
You can listen to books on tape while driving longer distances. Organizations
sell tapes of conference presentations.
You can be a resource to yourself. In fact, you will be your own best critic.
Videotape an actual training session and play it back to identify what you like
and what you do not like about your training style. If you think taping the ses-
sion will be disruptive, you may wish to tape yourself during a practice ses-
sion or just audiotape your session. Of course you will not have the visual
portion, but you can hear how you sound and will be able to critique the
audio portion of your training session. 
Learning and growing are ongoing processes, even if you are at the top of
your profession. Often it is what you learn after you “know it all” that counts.
Aspire to the best of your profession.
Go the Extra Mile: Stay on Top 
of Your Game!
Go the extra mile? Gosh! Isn’t becoming a lifelong learner enough? Well, learn-
ing new skills is just the beginning. Going the extra mile means that you are
looking for ways to constantly improve. How can you be more than a good
trainer, a great trainer? In addition, how can you keep your energy up ALL the
time? Even if this is the 49th time you have conducted the same session? Is it
really possible to be enthusiastic and energetic? Yes it is!
Good to great
A widely read book, Good to Great, by Jim Collins provides a format to think
about how trainers can upgrade their skills (see Table 15-1). The left-hand
column in the table lists attributes of good trainers. But good can be great.
Several ideas that go beyond good to great are listed in the middle column.
Space is available in the right column for you to add your thoughts about
what you could do to move from the already good trainer you are to a great
trainer.

Imagine this. You are about to go into a training program that you have taught
countless times. You are starting to lose interest in the topic, and you are 
289
Chapter 15: The Consummate Professional

wondering how you will get through this without being monotonous and
boring. Here are some thoughts about how you can make every training ses-
sion seem as exciting as your first.
 Recharge your batteries every day. You owe it to your participants to give
every session everything you have. Self-talk works well for me: “This will
be the best darn training these participants have ever experienced!” 
 Even though the topic is not new to you, it is to the participants.
Remembering that they may be hearing the information for the first
time is exciting. Determine how to have more participant involvement
to experience the topic from another perspective.
 Do something that is just a little crazy; for example, if you are showing a
video, serve popcorn; ask participants to use crayons for a particular
activity; on a nice day, hold a discussion outside.
 Use previous evaluations for the program to determine an area for
improvement. Then integrate improvements into the next program. By
striving for continuous improvement, you will never have to train the
same program twice.
 A day before the session, examine the part of the program you dislike
the most. Chances are it never was right for you. In my case, it is usually
more presenting and less interaction. Rework that part of the program
so that you eliminate the reason you don’t like it. In my case, it would be
identifying a way to increase participation.
 Observe someone else conducting the session (or other sessions) to
identify new presentation or facilitation techniques.
 Page through a Pfeiffer Annual, one of the Games Trainers Play books, or
another activity book (see the Training For Dummies resource list on my
Web site at www.ebbweb.com) to add a new or revise a timeworn activity.
 Experiment with activities you have not used before: funneling, an in-
basket, or a relay.
 Try a new presentation technique or media; for example, use overhead
transparencies or conduct a debate.
 Conduct research about the topic (the Web, journals, books) so that you
have new information to share or so that you feel better prepared.
 Invite a guest speaker to conduct the part of the workshop that is most
energy draining for you.
 Co-facilitate a portion of the session, perhaps role-playing with the other
trainer or introducing a “point-counterpoint” type discussion.
 Get to know the participants personally. This helps you appreciate how
much they need the information you have to give.
 Identify new energizers to use with the group each day. Energy is conta-
gious. You will catch it from the participants.
290
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

 Find cartoons or quotes that relate to the session and introduce them
after breaks or as energizers.
 The night before the session, pull out your Smile File that’s filled with
thank-you cards, fabulous evaluations, special notes, cartoons that make
you laugh, clippings, or articles about you. Spend 20 minutes looking
through it. What? You don’t have a Smile File? Better start one today.
 Approach every training program as though you want it to be your best
ever. Remember how good you feel after you have completed a training
program and the participants loved it.
 Try reverse psychology: Think about the worst job you ever had (mine
was making plastic wastepaper baskets on the midnight shift) and com-
pare conducting the training to it.
 Determine a reward for yourself following the training session.
 Now identify two more things that keep you going and list them here.
• I could . . .
• I could . . .
Design
If you design often, take care that you do not fall into a rut of doing the same
things over and over. Try something new. It keeps your designs fresh and
keeps you inspired and interested.
Plan to include a new type of activity in each program that you design. If you
have never used a game show to review material, build one in. If you rarely
use guest speakers or role plays, consider them. There is such a wide variety
of activities, you may never run out of ideas.
What does professional mean to you?
Every trainer needs to define what it means to be “professional.” Take time to
determine what it means to you to be a true professional. Write your thoughts
out on paper. Share them with others. Consider it for a panel discussion topic
at your local ASTD chapter meeting. 
Develop your personal training code of ethics; that is, what do you intend to
live by and honor as a trainer? It could include delivering only the highest
quality training, always giving credit to others to whose work you refer, hold-
ing confidential information close, and respecting all learners. A code of
ethics gives you a guide, something to live by and on which to base deci-
sions.
291
Chapter 15: The Consummate Professional

To get you started thinking about what it means to be a professional, inter-
view another trainer whose work you respect and who has been around the
profession for a while.

Part V: The Professional Trainer 
Ten core skills of a master trainer
by Bob Pike CSP, CPAE-Speakers Hall of Fame
I believe that we make ourselves more valuable
when we develop what I call CORE Skills. In man-
agement training we often refer to these as soft
skills, but I think this is a misnomer. Why?
Because people are most often hired for the
technical skills (their ability to do the job — what-
ever the job maybe), and they are fired for their
lack of personal skills — that ability to work with
and through others. These personal skills are the
ten CORE Skills I challenge you to master:
1. Make and keep commitments. This means
that a “yes” is a “yes” and a “no” is a “no.”
Many people make promises and don’t follow
through. Or they overpromise and underdeliver.
What if you and all the employees in your orga-
nization were known as people who made com-
mitments and kept them. Do you think this would
help you gain a competitive advantage?
2. Face each day with a positive attitude. It’s
been said that we burn three times as much
energy when thinking negatively as when think-
ing positively. What if you and each person in
your organization looked for ways things could
be done, instead of reasons why they couldn’t?
What if we looked at the potentials and possi-
bilities, instead of the problems?
3. Persist until you succeed. Most people quit
one step short of success. Thomas Edison, who
failed ten thousand times before successfully
creating a practical, sustainable light bulb, said
most people would not have failed if they had
simply tried one more time. He also said that he
didn’t fail 10,000 times — he simply found 9,999
ways it wouldn’t work!
4. Have a clear positive self-image. For years, I
sold and conducted a program that thousands
of others could sell and conduct as well. My
price was even a bit higher. There were always
those that were willing to cut the price a bit —
even a lot — just to make a sale. I didn’t. When
asked what justified the difference I said, “All
other things being equal, you get me with this.”
I didn’t say it to brag or be boastful. My attitude
was the same at 25 that it is at 55. What I mean
is that I’m committed to getting you results, not
just selling you a product. That attitude, that
self-concept, that commitment, is worth the dif-
ference. I completed a “Faith at Work” program
with Ken Blanchard of One Minute Manager
fame. He talked about EGO meaning Edging God
Out. He pointed out that this could happen with
pride, thinking more of ourselves than we ought
to — and also with self-doubt — thinking less
of ourselves than we ought to.
5. Multiply your value 100-fold. Many people
focus on the MDR — the Minimum Daily
Requirement: what is the least I can do to get
by? My focus is on the most we can give to add
value to whatever we do. What if we had an
organization made up of people who were con-
stantly looking for ways to add value? What
power! I consulted for an organization that had
been forced to reduce salaries, cut jobs, and
faced two years before things improved. We
pulled a group of 150 managers together and in
small groups led them through a process where
they had to find ways to recognize and reward
employees without using pay, promises, or pro-
motions. In less than two hours we had a list of
over 150 ways that managers could use cafete-
ria style — picking and choosing those that
would work best with their individual employ-
ees. Using some of these would help all man-
agers to increase their value by creating a more
motivational environment.

6. Treat this day as if it were your last. What if
everyone in your organization always focused
on the highest priorities — both personally and
professionally? What if we lived this day in a
compartment, not letting yesterday’s challenges
creep in, not letting tomorrow’s problems drain
energy — just focusing on doing the absolute
best we can right now? What do you need to do
today that would cause you at the end of the
day to have no regrets?
7. Master your emotions. Sister Kenny was
founder of the Sister Kenny Institute and origi-
nator of innovative cancer therapies even
though she was not a medical doctor. She faced
harsh criticism for years until her methods
finally proved themselves. How did she manage
her emotions in the midst of unjust accusations?
Perhaps it started at age 6 when she lost her
temper over a difference with a playmate. Her
mother took her aside and said, “Any one who
angers you, conquers you!” Those words must
have played back through her adult years until
her methods were proven. Look at the work that
would have been lost, the tens of thousands that
would not have received treatment if she had
not known how to rein her emotions in. Her
refusal to explode kept her critics from having
ammunition with which to destroy her work.
8. Laugh at the world and yourself. We take our-
selves too seriously. We all make mistakes. Are
we going to get down on ourselves or learn from
them and laugh at them? Nurse educators have
explained to me that often there is laughter in
very serious training classes containing life-or-
death content. Why? “Because,” they say,
“What we do is too serious to take seriously all
the time.” Can you laugh and learn even when
things do not go your way?
9. See a need, take action. All too often people
see a need and say, “That’s not my job.” Elbert
Hubbard wrote a delightful small book over 100
years ago called “A Message to Garcia.” It was
about an army officer who took a message from
Roosevelt to a Cuban revolutionary and emerged
from the jungle after three weeks having deliv-
ered the message, no questions asked. What if
everyone in your organization took action when
the need arose, rather than passing the buck?
Let’s have a renaissance of initiative!
10. Seek guidance. Are we willing to ask for
help — especially from a Higher Power? Are we
willing to ask that we be guided to opportunities
to use the talents that we’ve been given? Are
we willing to ask for the wisdom to discern
those opportunities that are great rather than
those that are merely good? I keep a prayer
journal. I spend time praying for world leaders,
our nation’s leaders, our teachers, our children,
my extended family, and so on. As people share
needs, I add them to my prayer journal. I pray
for the companies that I’m involved in and their
employees. And I seek guidance to use the tal-
ents and abilities that I’ve been blessed with. 
So now you’ve had a look at all ten CORE Skills.
If you want to put into practice some of these
concepts let me offer the following: Read Og
Mandino’s book, The Greatest Salesman in the
World. This book is less about selling and more
about developing the personal skills needed to
succeed in any job. In fact, they are really the
principles of living life at the highest level. The
book still sells over a million copies years after
its first publication in 1968. 

Techniques Handbook. The focus of his work is using involvement and partici-
pation at all levels to drive greater results. Bob is my model of a consummate
professional trainer. He presents ten core skills all professional trainers
should live by in the “Ten core skills of a master trainer” sidebar.
Give Back to the Profession
All trainers receive advice and ideas from others throughout their careers.
Therefore, all trainers owe something to the profession. How can you do that?
 Publish what you have learned or your ideas for others to consider.
Training Magazine and T&D Journal are two publications that print arti-
cles by practitioners. The Pfeiffer Annual publishes activities, articles,

Training is a profession that gives a great deal to its members. Think about
how you can give back to the profession, your community, and individuals.
Yes, it takes a great deal to be a professional trainer. You can do it. Be all the
things that you are capable of being. Astound yourself. Thomas Edison
believed that “If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally
astound ourselves.”

 Getting information about ASTD
 Finding out more about the ASTD Competency Model
 Understanding certification: What it means for you 
You may be feeling a bit overwhelmed about the number of skills and the
amount of knowledge trainers require to do their jobs. It can be over-
whelming. But support is available. The American Society for Training &
Development (ASTD) is the world’s largest association dedicated to work-
place learning and performance professionals, and to providing content and
resources to individuals, like you, who enter and work in the field. 
Two ASTD initiatives are particularly exciting:
 The ASTD Competency Model 
 ASTD’s certification offering, based on that model
Both of these initiatives will continue to have a profound effect on the work-
place learning and performance profession and on each member of the 
profession. 
This chapter provides you with an introduction to ASTD and what the associa-
tion offers. It also provides an overview of the ASTD Competency Study,
Mapping the Future, and its value to the profession. Most exciting, however, is
the introduction to the ASTD Certification Program and what it means to you.
The Certification Program was a direct result of the study.
Due to its far-reaching effect, I am most excited about the topics in this chap-
ter. Jennifer Naughton, ASTD Manager of both the ASTD Competency Study
and the Certification Program, has graciously given her time to assist with
writing this chapter.

Chapter 16: Training Certification
ASTD’s history
ASTD celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2004.
The seeds of the organization were sown in
New Orleans, Louisiana, during a training com-
mittee meeting of the American Petroleum
Institute in 1942. The United States was at war,
and training was critical to meeting the needs
of increased production and replacing workers
gone to war. The following year, a group of 15
men met for the first board meeting of the
American Society of Training Directors in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana.
These training pioneers became the nucleus of
a national group, which convened the ASTD
membership for the first time in Chicago in 1945.
Other local, regional, and industry-specific
training groups gradually aligned with ASTD. 
ASTD adopted a constitution at its 1946 con-
vention that established two goals: to raise the
standards and prestige of the industrial training
profession and to further the professional’s edu-
cation and development. These two goals have
remained part of ASTD’s mission even as the
profession evolved and needs changed. 
In 1964, the association changed its name to the
American Society for Training & Development.
In recent years, ASTD has widened its focus to
connect learning and performance to measur-
able results. 

 ROI Network conferences and workshops focus on developing the pro-
fession’s ability to measure and evaluate return on investment
 ASTD supports 137 local chapters in the United States and 12 global net-
works around the world
To be a part of this rewarding profession, become a member of ASTD. You
will be amazed at what a difference it makes to have the opportunity to grow
and network with other professionals like yourself.
. . . and a whole lot more
ASTD recognizes a number of best practices in the profession through sev-
eral awards programs: ASTD BEST Awards, Excellence in Practice Awards,
Advancing ASTD’s Vision Awards, Advancing Workplace Learning and
Performance Awards, Research-to-Practice Awards, and ROI Network Awards.
And, ASTD advocates on behalf of the profession to promote U.S. public poli-
cies that support a highly skilled workforce and provides the media with
expertise on trends in workplace learning and performance.
ASTD has an online career center and job bank and offers a wide range of
tools and information on workforce development, learning, and performance
on its Web site at www.astd.org.
Introducing the ASTD Competency Model
The ASTD Competency Model — developed in partnership among ASTD,
Development Dimensions International (DDI), and Rothwell & Associates
(R&A) — provides a strategic model for the profession. With an eye toward
the future, the model enables individuals and institutions to be prepared to
align their work with organizational priorities. The model’s comprehensive
view of the field unifies the profession and defines various areas of expertise.
Overview of the model
Having a defined set of competencies is a hallmark of any profession. The
ASTD Competency Model defines standards of excellence for trainers and
others in the workplace learning and performance profession. The model,
shaped like a pyramid (see Figure 16-1), displays three layers of knowledge
and skill: foundational competencies, areas of expertise, and roles. What is
contained in each of these layers? The following sections provide the details.
298
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

Competencies
Competencies encompass the clusters of skills, knowledge, abilities, and
behaviors required for success in all jobs in the profession. In simple terms,
this is what those in the profession collectively need to know and do to be
successful.
Foundational competencies
Foundational competencies underlie the successful completion of many tasks,
and are, therefore, found at the base of the model. The model defines each of
the 12 foundational competencies and provides examples of actions that can
be included in each. The 12 foundational competencies have been placed into
three clusters: interpersonal, business/management, and personal. 
 Interpersonal: Every job requires a certain level of interpersonal acumen.
The ASTD Competency Model identifies a set of interpersonal competen-
cies that are important to trainers and others in the workplace learning
and performance profession. The interpersonal competencies include the
ability to build trust, communicate effectively, influence stakeholders,
leverage diversity, and take part in networking and partnering.

Chapter 16: Training Certification

 Business/management: The training profession continues to strengthen
its role in the boardroom. With that role comes an expectation of busi-
ness and management competencies. The model includes five business
and management competencies: analyzing needs and proposing solu-
tions; applying business acumen; driving results; planning and imple-
menting assignments; and thinking strategically. 
Although you will certainly find these competencies in many professions,
their existence in this model highlights the important role workplace
learning and performance professionals play to help drive organizational
success.
 Personal: The Competency Model identifies two personal competencies:
demonstrating adaptability and modeling personal development. These
two should not come as a surprise to you, given the emphasis of both
throughout this book. Trainers are often expected to model appropriate
behavior when change occurs whether it is global, cultural, economic,
social, or political.
Trainers must be role models of the profession. Chapter 15 clearly states that
it is the responsibility of members of the workplace learning and performance
profession to create learning opportunities to upgrade our own knowledge
and skills. As training professionals, we must ensure that we are in a continu-
ous learning mode for two reasons: first, to serve as role models; second,
because trainers must stay ahead of and on top of new developments in our
profession and in the industries that we serve.
Areas of expertise
Areas of expertise are the specific technical and professional skills and
knowledge required for success in the workplace and learning specialty
areas. Although some professionals are highly specialized, many people
demonstrate expertise in more than one area. 
Areas of expertise are positioned above the foundational competencies on
the model because they supplement them through specialized skills and
knowledge. Nine areas of expertise are identified. Just below the nine, a
narrow band depicting technology supports the areas of expertise. This rep-
resents the fact that all the areas rely on technology such as Web-based train-
ing to leverage and support their skills and knowledge.
The nine areas of expertise are listed here. This book covers several on the
list.
 Career planning and talent management
 Coaching
 Delivering training
 Designing learning
300
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

 Facilitating organizational change
 Improving human performance
 Managing organizational knowledge
 Managing the learning function
 Measuring and evaluating
Roles
Roles are broad areas of responsibility within the profession that require a
certain combination of competencies and areas of expertise to be effectively
realized. The roles are at the top of the model because they require a vast
body of skills and knowledge. The four roles and a brief definition of each are
as follows:
 Learning strategist: Determines how training and other workplace learn-
ing and performance improvement strategies can best be leveraged to
achieve business success and add value.
 Business partner: Applies business and industry knowledge to partner
with clients to identify opportunities by evaluating and recommending
solutions.
 Project manager: Plans, resources, and monitors the effective delivery
of training and other learning and performance solutions to support the
organization.
 Professional specialist: Designs, develops, delivers, or evaluates learn-
ing and performance solutions and maintains and applies an in-depth
working knowledge in any one of more of the areas of expertise.
The value of a competency model
The competencies, areas of expertise, and roles identified provide a model
for understanding the requirements of the profession. Although this is impor-
tant, the real value of the model is its application to enhance and elevate the
profession. Among other things, the competency model can be used to 
 Attract people into the profession
 Evaluate individuals for selection or promotion
 Guide career-planning decisions
 Assess job performance
 Establish a foundation for credentialing programs
301
Chapter 16: Training Certification

It is this last purpose, professional certification, that has created consider-
able excitement among trainers and others in the workplace learning and per-
formance profession.
If you are serious about being a professional in the workplace learning and
performance arena, you want to obtain your certification. To get started,
obtain your personal copy of The ASTD Competency Study, Mapping the Future
by Bernthal, et al. 
Certification: What It Means for You
In the preceding section of this chapter, you find out about the ASTD
Competency Study and how it provides a road map for guiding professional
development and the future of the profession. Now, I switch gears and focus
on certification and its implications. Before describing the value and compo-
nents of ASTD’s Certification Program, the following section starts with some
context.
Certification versus certificate
Certification is a voluntary process whereby a professional body such as ASTD
recognizes or grants a designation to professionals who have met certain qual-
ifications or standards. Certified individuals are usually issued a designation
recognizing that they have met those standards. 
Certification and certificate are often used interchangeably, but they do not
mean the same thing. Certification and certificate programs differ in their cri-
teria and goals. In certification, the focus is on assessing knowledge and skills.
In a certificate program, the focus is on the training provided to develop a cer-
tain knowledge and skill base (e-Answers e-zine “Credentialing, Licensure,
Certification, Accreditation, Certificates: What’s the Difference?” May 2002,
Volume 1, Issue 3, ©Mickie S. Rops & Associates). Furthermore, certificate
programs typically award a document signifying completion, with or without
an assessment. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization in terms and incon-
sistent application creates mayhem in the marketplace and really muddies
the water.
To determine which is which, ask yourself, Is the focus on the completion of a
learning experience (certificate) or the measurement of attained knowledge
and skills (certification)?

Certification: Why now?
Ninety percent of the nearly 2,000 academics, practitioners, and leaders in
the workplace learning and performance profession surveyed indicated that
they believed an ASTD professional credential would be beneficial to the
field. ASTD then made the decision to move forward with the development
of the professional Certification Program as a direct result of the demand.
The consensus was that this certification would serve as a powerful tool to
encourage professional development and a means to prove one’s value. 
Certification: Show me the value
So, what is the value of certification? In this section, I attempt to answer that
question. There are many levels of value: to the individual, the employer, and
the profession. I discuss some of the benefits to each group briefly. 
Value to the individual
Typically, individuals seek to become certified because it adds to their credi-
bility. It may also provide them with greater opportunities for employment,
promotion, and increased earning potential. It can also help to provide a
structured pathway for their professional development and encourages them
to stay current in the field. Sometimes, certification is even preferred for a
given job. 
Value to the employer
Certification also provides value to organizations. It can help employers by pro-
viding a reference point when evaluating jobs and promotion candidates. In the
January 2005 edition of Training + Development magazine, Jamie Mulkey, Ed.D.,
a test development and security expert from Caveon (a firm specializing in test
security), explains that organizations request certification from employees for
a number of reasons. “Primarily, organizations want to validate that their work-
force is qualified. And a rigorous testing process, such as professional certifica-
tion, helps them do this.” She added that “certification has become the mantra
for many organizations who want to ensure individuals in their organization are
competent to perform in a given job role.”
Value to the profession
According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), there are a number of crite-
ria that characterize a profession. One criterion includes having a set of
defined standards for the field. Certification can help to codify a profession
and establish these standards. In the case of training, the competency model
and related body of knowledge directly relate to the fulfillment of the DOL
definition. At the end of the day, certification can serve to raise the bar of
professional practice and to help protect against incompetent performance.
303
Chapter 16: Training Certification

In another sense, certification in the training field has intrinsic value. Because
competency assessment and people development are at the heart of what
people know and do in this field, certification is an important means to an
end. In fact, it is often the training and education departments that are the
first to outline the requirements for competent practice. Thus, this certifica-
tion is merely echoing at a macro level what is already being done by those
under its umbrella at the micro level.
ASTD Certification: A Quick Look
The Certification Program is new to the profession. The following sections
give you a quick look at what it will look like.
Competencies and certification 
The ASTD Competency Model provides a clear identification of skills, knowl-
edge, and specific behaviors needed for success. In broader terms, it identi-
fies what people across the field should know and be able to do collectively
for success. So, how is this model linked to certification? And how does it
provide a foundation for the Certification Program? 
Actually, the answer is pretty simple. The model essentially defines what the
relevant knowledge and behaviors are and answers the “what to certify”
question. Standards are built later to answer the question “How well does
one have to perform?” In combination, certification is based on the compe-
tencies and performance standards that are based on the model, and the cer-
tification designation indicates those standards have been met. 
Certification design 
At the time of writing, ASTD had defined the preliminary high-level certifica-
tion design (subject to refinement). The highlights of this design include the
following:
 Applicant eligibility: 2–3 years’ experience/equivalent in the profession
 Exam covers all nine Areas of Expertise plus “specialty” component(s)
• Specialty measured by performance-based assessment (for exam-
ple, portfolio, case example)
• Learning design and training delivery are among the more heavily
weighted Areas of Expertise

Chapter 16: Training Certification

Step 1: Assess general readiness
Applicants are encouraged to assess whether they are prepared for certifica-
tion and if certification (versus some other route, such as a college or univer-
sity degree or a course or learning event) meets their needs. 
Step 2: Apply and sign code of ethics/references
If certification is suitable, applicants complete an application, which includes
submitting references and signing a code of ethics.
Step 3: Complete assessment instrument (optional)
If desired, applicants can opt to take a practice exam or a self-assessment
instrument to pinpoint areas where additional work may be necessary. This
step helps determine where gaps may exist between what the applicant cur-
rently knows and does compared to what is expected.
Step 4: Complete curriculum and test prep (optional)
Applicants can choose from a variety of means to prepare for the assessment.
ASTD is developing supporting materials to help learners prepare for the exam.
Step 5: Receive feedback (optional)
Applicants can seek out or be provided with additional feedback. If a second
practice test is available, it can be used to pinpoint any areas that remain and
that need special attention.
Step 6: Complete general exam
After being assigned to a testing location, applicants take the general, knowl-
edge-based portion of the exam.
Step 7: Apply for one Area of Expertise submission
Upon passing the knowledge-based portion of the exam, applicants are eligi-
ble to apply for the performance-based component. 
Step 8: Complete case study or portfolio
The Area of Expertise performance submission provides an opportunity for
applicants to demonstrate their expertise in one of the nine Areas of Expertise.
Depending on the nature of the Area of Expertise selected, the assessment
ranges from a computer-based assessment to a videotaped submission or
role play.
Step 9: Designation awarded
Provided that applicants have passed both parts of the assessment and have
met all of the requirements, they are eligible for becoming certified.
Notification of certification designation will come from ASTD following the
completion of all paperwork and requirements.
306
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

Step 10: Apply for continuing educational units
In order to keep current and to contribute to moving the profession forward,
evidence of continuing education units are required for recertification. This
can come from a variety of sources at the time of writing:
 Supplier certificates
 ASTD certificate programs (for example, Human Performance
Improvement Certificate)
 Attending ASTD’s annual conference (ASTD’s International Conference
and Exposition)
 Certification in related programs (for example, Certified Performance
Technologist (CPT))
 ASTD chapter programs
 University programs or courses
 Volunteer services (boards or officer positions)
 Publications
Consult ASTD for specific point values and requirements pertaining to earn-
ing continuing education units.

Learning to be recognized
ASTD’s leadership in the training field goes hand in hand with its leadership
in developing certification for the broader profession and the continuous
learning that’s needed to keep skills relevant. In fact, learning is at the core
of ASTD’s mission and vision. Part of that responsibility includes providing
ongoing education and assessment to help keep the profession current. 
Failing to keep current can rob an individual of early warning signs that prob-
lems may lie ahead. If the demand for some of your skills is starting to increase,
you may miss a valuable opportunity to make a course correction. 
Staying current 
What are your responsibilities as a member of the profession for keeping cur-
rent? Keeping your certification status current through renewal indicates that
you are up-to-date on industry standards. Lifelong learning and its importance
is a popular concept these days. But the real challenge is not just talking about
it but doing it and also serving as a model for others. 
You can be a model of professionalism. Start your journey toward certifica-
tion today. For more information about either the Competency Model or the
Certification Program, visit www.astd.org/competency or send an e-mail to
competencystudy@astd.org. 
Your career depends on your continued ability to reinvent yourself and add
value. Use both the ASTD Competency Model and professional Certification
Program as a means to establish the value connection from where you are to
where you want to go. 
Certification is one of those small steps in your career that may make a huge
difference. Achieving certification in your field can be an adventure, one of
those life experiences you should not pass up. I live my life by a Helen Keller
quote: “Life is either a daring adventure . . . or nothing.”

 Organizations are becoming more flexible, networked, and virtual,
requiring employees to be on call 24/7.
 A global economy is changing the marketplace, resulting in outsourcing
and global collaboration and competition.
 Increased diversity, increased use of temporary workers, a greater
demand for highly skilled workers, and an increasing number of retirees
all contribute to major changes in the complexion of the workforce.
 The pace of change is faster than ever, requiring organizations and
employees to be more flexible.
 Concerns about security are increasing anxiety.
 Technology is shaping how and where we work, live, and learn.
 Corporate ethics and are more important than ever.

You may see these trends as indicating a need to provide training better,
faster, and cheaper. And you are right! Each of these trends lends itself to a
trainer’s need to produce better training, in a shorter time frame, and at a
more reasonable cost than in the past.
This chapter addresses some of the ramifications of these trends. In an effort
to provide better, faster, and cheaper training, one of the biggest changes is a
move from training toward performance improvement, recognizing that train-
ing is not the solution to all problems. 
This chapter also focuses on delivery formats available to trainers who will
live with these trends, including team training, technology, and part-time
trainers. And finally, the chapter addresses how to be successful with today’s
diverse learners.
The Changing Training Environment
The trends require all training departments to be more efficient and produc-
tive and to affect the bottom line in a positive way. This change has been
coming for a long time and brings with it a need for trainers to partner with
management, for training to be linked to a business need, and for trainers to
rely on multiple solutions (as opposed to training only).

Part V: The Professional Trainer 
What you need to know about performance
by Dana Robinson
Learning and performance: How are they dif-
ferent? Learning and performance are not the
same. Learning experiences develop skills and
knowledge so people can perform. Perfor-
mance occurs when people apply this skill and
knowledge in the workplace, accomplishing
results for the business. People can know how
to do many things yet not apply those skills in
the workplace. So, while knowing is important,
by itself it is not enough to enhance perfor-
mance of people on the job. Most studies of
training programs indicate that people apply
less than half of what they have learned on the
job. Therefore, a significant investment in learn-
ing may not result in a benefit to the employee
or to the organization.
Why do people learn a skill and not use it on
the job? People do not use skills on the job
when they return to a work environment which
is nonsupportive. The work environment is the
infrastructure which surrounds employees;
while we cannot always see it, we can always
feel it. Examples include the incentives and
rewards within the organization, the amount of
coaching and reinforcement which is available,
and clarity of roles and expectations. People
perform on the job when they have the required
skills and knowledge plus the rewards and rein-
forcements for using those skills and knowl-
edge. Keep in mind this formula:
(Skill and Knowledge) × (A Supportive Work
Environment) 
= 
Successful 
On-the-Job
Performance

311
Chapter 17: Training Trends
If the skill and knowledge factor is “100” but the
work environment is “zero,” there will be no
performance change following training.
What is the role of management regarding
learning and performance? While trainers can
control a great deal of the learning design and
delivery, ensuring that people do acquire skill
and knowledge, they cannot control the work
environment to which employees return follow-
ing a training program. This is where manage-
ment must be active. There are really two levels
of management to consider. The first level of
management is the direct manager of the
employee. This person will, more than any other
individual, influence whether employees do —
or do not — use their newly learned skills. This
person can encourage employees to use the
skills, coaching and guiding employees when
they are having difficulty doing so; these actions
will result in a higher use of skills. Unfortunately,
this type of reinforcement is not always present.
There is also higher-level management to
involve. More senior managers can make
changes at a broad level...such as ensuring
people have the tools and equipment they need
to use their skills and perform as required. 
What motivates management to be involved?
For management to ensure the work environ-
ment is supportive of training programs, the link-
age between the skills being developed and the
goals and requirements of the business must be
evident. How will the skills people acquire in a
specific training program benefit the organiza-
tion? The greater the alignment between train-
ing and the business goals, the more likely
management will actively support the skill build-
ing that is done.
So what’s a trainer to do? Realize that train-
ing, by itself, will not change performance.
Then include in the learning design and the
implementation strategy for the program some
or all of the following techniques.
 Ensure that the learning experience is
directly linked to the business goals of your
organization and is developing skills which
are job-relevant for the participants. You
accomplish both these goals by completing
a quality needs assessment.
 Keep appropriate managers in your organi-
zation informed and engaged during the
design and implementation process for your
training program. 
 Include in the learning design skill building
experiences which are job-relevant to
those attending. This will assist participants
in identifying the linkage between the skills
being developed and what participants
need to do on the job with these skills.
Ensure participants know the WIIFM factor
. . . What’s In It For Me when I learn and
apply these skills?
 When applicable, provide job aids that
assist the participants in applying the skills
on the job. If you are developing people to
conduct interviews, provide an interview
guide to use. If people are to use a software
program, provide a printed summary of the
steps used to access and use the program.
 In the learning experience, encourage par-
ticipants to identify one or two barriers they
will encounter as they use their new skills.
Then facilitate a discussion about actions
the participants can take to overcome these
barriers.
 Encourage participants to meet with their
managers, when they return to their jobs, to
discuss the skills they have learned and
how they are to utilize them.

The change brings a broader definition of what trainers do, even changing
the title from trainer to performance consultant. Don’t despair. Many excel-
lent trainers have always conducted business as performance consultants,
working hand-in-hand with management to add value to the organization.
Change may be huge for some trainers; it is less so for others.
One of the early leaders in the area of performance consulting is Dana
Robinson. Together with her husband and business partner, James Robinson,
she has authored numerous books to help HRD functions to transition to a
performance focus. Dana describes the change to performance in the sidebar.
Alternative Training Options
Alternatives for training are numerous and include everything from facilitated
classroom to computer based with no facilitator, from one-on-one coaching to
multiple participants, and from one site to a global Webinar. This section
introduces some of the options available to you. The following section exam-
ines e-learning formats.
What’s to know about e-learning?
In the late ’90s many organizations jumped on the e-learning bandwagon
thinking that instructor-led training was going the way of the horse and
buggy. But it was a bit too early for instant success. 
How much e-learning is actually taking place?
Training Magazine’s annual industry report (October 2004) is a barometer of
employer-sponsored training in the United States. It reports that classroom
training continues to hover around 70 percent. The delivery of training utiliz-
ing a computer and no instructor averaged 17 percent. The remaining 13 per-
cent delivery was instructor led from remote location and other
miscellaneous delivery formats. 
It is likely that the many formats of e-learning will continue to play a role in
training delivery but probably not “take over” instructor-led training, as was
once thought. 
What is e-learning?
E-learning (electronic learning) is a term that defines a broad set of applica-
tions and processes with assistance from technology. It has many names
besides e-learning, including computer-based training, Web-based training,
distributed learning, virtual classrooms, and distance learning. E-learning is
a partial answer to some of the trend issues above.

 Achieving higher productivity with fewer human resources, e-learning is
a solution that reduces the number of hours spent in the classroom and
time away from work.
 A global environment allows participants to be located anywhere in the
world and receive some of the same training opportunities.
 Cost-cutting measures mean there is less money to be spent on training,
and e-learning can be a solution.
 The accelerated pace of change may require more employees to gain skills
faster than ever before, and an e-learning solution can accomplish that.
What is all this jargon?
The following list provides definitions to expose you to several e-learning
solutions. Entire books have been written about most, so don’t think you will
have the knowledge to implement any as a result of this chapter. 
 Computer-based training (CBT): A basic term for the use of computers
in managing and presenting content to participants. The learning is self-
paced and can be individualized. Frequently participants have choices
in the mode, for example, video, audio, graphic, verbal, or a combina-
tion. Most computer-based training is interactive, including simulation,
problem solving, games, and so on.
 CD-ROM courses: The original form of CBT, in the form of a read-only
memory compact disc. This has given way to Web-based training.
 Web-based training (WBT): Web-based training is still CBT because it
takes place on computers. Access to the Internet or corporate Intranet
and a Web browser is required. WBT allows learners to be in control of
the pace of their learning. It solves material distribution concerns, and
updates to materials can be made instantly. Corporate firewalls can
sometimes pose a problem but can usually be resolved by the corporate
IT department.
To achieve success in Web-based training, ensure that the learners take
responsibility for their own learning. This means that a trainer’s job is to
make certain that learners are adequately prepared.
 Performance Support System (PSS): A combination of expert coaches
and mentor, documents, tools, and decision support tools that help
employees make the right decision on the job. It assists performance at
the job site. 
 Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS): When the PSS uses
computers to store, capture, reconfigure, and distribute information to
assist the employee, it is called EPSS — on-the-job support and training
at its finest. Major benefits of EPSS are to improve job performance,
decrease training time and costs, and increase retention.
313
Chapter 17: Training Trends

 Distance learning: Instructional delivery that does not require the par-
ticipant to be physically present in the same location as the facilitator. In
the past it may have meant a correspondence course. Today video, audio,
and computer technologies are common delivery formats.
 Distributed learning: Similar to distance learning, but the resources are
distributed, allowing learners to have more control over their learning
by being able to access content, peers, experts, and services on their
own timeline.
 Webinars: Live training or seminars delivered to a dispersed audience
that uses real-time audio and video or scheduled online demonstrations.
May use a combination of a telephone and computer.
Be sure to design any e-learning to engage the learners and promote meaning-
ful interaction. Pique learners’ curiosity through humor, games, puzzles, prob-
lem-solving exercises, self-assessments, checklists, and other novel design
elements. Plan for frequent feedback in the design to reinforce learning.
How can you learn more?
If you are not familiar with e-learning, begin as a learner. I suggest you start
by joining a virtual classroom experience. Vendors will often host free ses-
sions to introduce you to their products. Note how the facilitator encouraged
interaction and how the material was presented.
To keep yourself motivated, team up with another trainer who is in the same
situation. Discuss what you learn, compare designs and delivery, and track
product information or other things that are important to your organization.
It won’t take long; soon you will be riding the technology wave rather than
drowning in a sea of e-jargon.
Blended learning
Blended learning is a recent buzzword that mixes e-learning with other train-
ing formats. Imagine that you are at a salad bar, selecting all the best ingredi-
ents. Blended learning allows you to pick and choose what will work best to
meet the organization’s and participants’ needs.
Blended learning is a natural evolution of e-learning that includes Web-based
training, CD-ROM courses, videos, Webinars, EPSS, and simulations. It also
includes the less glamorous media including classroom training, job aids,
books, coaching, and conference calls. When designing a blended-learning
solution, consider some of these points.
 Blended learning optimizes resources, providing the greatest impact for
the least investment. Remember to consider the organizational culture
and how receptive it will be to changes in delivery formats.
314
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

 The blended-learning solution should be solution focused — what is the
business problem you are solving and what is the best way to solve the
problem? 
 Technology capabilities will drive at least some portion of the blended-
learning solution, but remember to include the characteristics of the
audience (time available, how motivated, their learning style) and the
characteristics of the content (the subject-matter experts, type of con-
tent: skill-based or knowledge-based, how soon it will be out of date).
 Almost all blended-learning solutions will require a communication/
marketing plan prior to deployment.
Considerations for one-on-one training
One-on-one training may have a number of names, but it can be chunked into
two areas. On-the-job training and coaching or mentoring. On-the job training
may include coaching or instruction. The distinguishing factor is that it takes
place in the learner’s workplace. Coaching is developing the skills and experi-
ences of learners by providing them with progressively more difficult tasks
that stretch them to perform. It is paired with continuous discussion, feed-
back, and counseling.
You would use one-on-one training when you need to personally involve the
learner or when highly specialized training is required. Although some people
believe that it is a good format because it is simple and fast and anyone can
conduct one-on-one training, they are wrong. It is true that it is a good format,
but more understanding is required. 
It can be simple and fast during the time the trainer is with the learner, but
this is due to a good deal of up-front preparation. In addition, “anyone”
cannot conduct good one-on-one training. It requires someone who has good
communication skills, is patient, has a high amount of content-related and
contextual knowledge, and is easily approachable. 
Remember to use media and visuals for one-on-one training, too. You proba-
bly would not set up a computer for a PowerPoint presentation, but you cer-
tainly could print off a hard copy of the presentation. If a video was useful to
a group of participants, it will be useful to individual participants as well.
Often the responsibility for one-on-one training lies with the learner’s super-
visor. The person may be new to the organization or be presented with new
work. If you are the supervisor/trainer in this case, think of this role as an
extension of your leadership skills. Like a leader, you will steer learners in
the right direction, guiding them to the correct decisions and helping them
uncover new knowledge. 
315
Chapter 17: Training Trends

One-on-one trainers use some of the same learning strategies as classroom
trainers; however, they have the advantage of focusing on only one learner.
Build some of these learning strategies into your one-on-one training.
 Begin by describing the whole picture. What should it look like when
completed correctly? Where does the learner fit in the process? Provide
the big picture.
 Clarify the expectations and requirements. Be sure that the learner knows
what is expected. Discuss the gap between where the learner is now and
what is expected.
 Provide new information that the learner needs to know. Recommend
people or other resources that can help with the new information.
Provide documents or other data that would be helpful. Do not go
beyond what the learner needs to know at this time.
 Demonstrate the process wherever possible.
 Present problems as a learning method. Provide feedback and sugges-
tions for improvement.
 Plan time to follow up with the learner.
 Leave the learner with job aids that can be used for review or guidance
after the session has ended.
You see that the process is not that different from a classroom situation in
that you use similar techniques.
Team Training
Few things in the training field can be as frustrating and at the same time as
enriching as team training. Having the opportunity to train with a colleague is
a unique opportunity to grow. Trainers frequently are a one-person show and
rarely have the opportunity to work with a colleague and to obtain feedback
from someone in the same profession. It is also an opportunity to watch
another person model new techniques and approaches, tell new jokes, and
present content from a new perspective.
At the same time the experience can be very frustrating. The other trainer
may take longer on a section, causing you to cut material. The other trainer’s
style may be opposite yours; for example, you keep the front table neat and
orderly, while the other person prefers to spend time with participants and
doesn’t bother organizing until the end of the day. The other trainer presents
content in a different way, and you wonder if one of you is incorrect. 
The bottom line is that the participants must see you working as a team.
They should see nothing but two professionals making sure that they are con-
ducting the best darn training they’ve ever attended.
316
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

Meet prior to the session
Meet at least once prior to the session to review the schedule and content. At
that time, assign responsibilities and negotiate ground rules. Spend time
ensuring clear understanding of your expectations of each other and the out-
come of the session. The following suggestions should be considered a mini-
mum.
 Discuss your training style preference.
 Discuss the logistics: room setup and number and type of participants.
 Identify any modifications to be made to the design.
 Walk through the session, making notes about who will do what.
 Identify where the supporting trainer will be located physically in the
training room.
 Request specific feedback from each other.
 Exchange contact information if necessary, especially cellphone numbers. 
 Identify how and when to intervene during the session.
Make each other look good 
during the session
During the session, both trainers need to work as a team. Even if you are
training only half the material, it is still a full-time job. Reading the paper in
the back of the room while your partner is training in the front is not accept-
able behavior. So what do you do?
 Remain in the room with your co-facilitator.
 Stay mentally engaged to ensure that you can assist when necessary.
 Take notes to provide useful feedback during the post-session debrief.
 Stick to the ground rules you established, for example:
• Stand if you want to add something, but wait for the okay from the
lead (person who is “on” at the time) trainer.
• The lead trainer always makes the final call (if an error was made
and the lead did not acknowledge the supporting trainer, it can be
discussed at the next break and a decision made about how to
handle it).
• Do not correct the other trainer in front of the group.
317
Chapter 17: Training Trends

If you must deliver a message to your co-trainer that is not content-related
(such as “The lunch hasn’t arrived yet; continue until 12:15”), write your note
on a piece of paper, fold it in half, and unobtrusively place it on the table next
to your partner. Few participants will notice. It won’t interrupt the flow. Your
partner will know that it is important but not to break into the content. 
 Assist each other during fishbowls, in small-group activities, or by chart-
ing while the other is leading a discussion.
 Each of you should be responsible for an equal amount of the boring or
difficult sections.
 If individuals are struggling with course content, one of the trainers can
provide additional support off-line.
 If you are supporting, stay one step ahead of the other person. What’s
the next activity? Are all materials available? Can you hang a chart page
on the wall?
Learn from your co-facilitator. Take advantage of training with another trainer
to build your repertoire of skills. Observe new techniques, ask for feedback
on specific delivery skills you wish to improve, and pick up stories, examples,
and personal touches that seem to work with the participants. This is a
golden opportunity. Grab it.
 Two trainers, working well together, establish a model of cooperation
and teamwork for the participants.
 Use the advantage of two for modeling, role-playing, acting, or debating
two points of view.
 Carry your fair share, whether you are the lead trainer in the front of the
room or the supporting trainer in the back. 
The supporting trainer has a perfect opportunity to watch participants’ body
language. This will provide insight about how well the content is being
received and if adaptations are required.
 Show mutual respect, demonstrate listening, and display nonverbal
agreement.
 Ensure that both of you have personal time during the break.
Provide feedback following the session
Meet immediately after the session to discuss how things went. If you have
kept notes during the session, you will be better prepared and organized for
the meeting.
318
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

If this is a multiple-day session, meet at the end of each day so that you don’t
lose valuable feedback. The next day will be filled with new experiences and
will overtake the previous day.
 Provide a professional critique that includes both positive feedback as
well as areas for improvement.
 Some organizations develop a checklist of skills and attributes they
deem necessary.
 Give feedback on the items the other person has requested. Be honest,
candid, sincere, and sensitive.
 Use specific examples to make your point.
 Identify areas in the training materials, content, or delivery that should
be changed or improved; document these to forward to your supervisor.
 Use excellent communication, listening, and feedback skills. You will
grow professionally and benefit from the opportunity (or even the chal-
lenge) to interact with another trainer having a different style, personal-
ity, pace, and viewpoint.
 Celebrate successes.
Training with a partner can be one of the best experiences you’ve ever had as
a trainer. Use these guidelines to ensure it.

The art of managing both 
training and your real job
As a part-time trainer, one of the biggest problems you may have is managing
both your training responsibilities and your real job. These tips will help you.
 Accept training projects that are consistent with the objectives of your
position.
 When you know you will be training, keep a resource file on that topic
handy. Clip articles and save other relevant information in these resource
files. When you are ready to prepare, all your resources will be in one
spot.
319
Chapter 17: Training Trends

 Keep a list of points you want to make/things you want to do. Keep the
list handy so that when you think of things, you can write them down.
When you are ready to prepare, all your thoughts will be collected on
your list. 
Use index cards to collect your ideas. You can easily track each as you pre-
sent it.
 Keep a training bag ready. Have markers, pens, masking tape (whatever
you consistently use in training) stored in an old brief case. When it’s
time to train, just grab your bag. There’s no need to scurry around for
the things you need.
 Keep all your training manuals, handouts, and audiovisuals in one spot.
This prevents you from having to assemble everything at the last minute.
Discipline yourself to replenish supplies in your kit immediately on returning
from the current training session; it will always be ready to go. 
 If you have just completed a program and you know you’ll be doing it
again, write a summary of what went well/what you’d do differently
immediately following the program. Make any changes at that time too. If
you do this while the material is fresh in your mind, it will save you time.
 Remember that investment pays off. If you spend adequate time prepar-
ing for your training the first time you do it, you will benefit every time
you train.
Training on the run
What about those times that you are expected to design an interactive train-
ing session, based on data, on short notice? Or the times that management
asks you to condense your session down from a day to two hours?
Impossible you say? You may feel that way, but as the trends clearly show,
efficiency and productivity take precedence now. Because this is more the
norm than the exception, these suggestions will help you next time it occurs.
 Conduct a needs assessment that ensures you are training the most
important knowledge and skills, and only the most important knowledge
and skills.
 Make use of job aids that can be used during the training session and
easily referenced after the session.
 Use a practical, yet simple-to-remember process to teach whatever you
need to. Three steps should be the maximum.
 A shortened time frame does not mean that you turn everything into a
lecture. If anything, it is even more critical that participants are involved
and experience the skills they must learn.
320
Part V: The Professional Trainer 

 Identify how you will follow up with participants. Send an e-mail the next
day with reminders of key concepts. Another e-mail or reminder letter a
week later jogs memories.
 You may not have much time left for an evaluation, so ask one or two
questions, key questions, such as, “What is the most useful concept
you learned in this session?” or “What is one thing you wished you had
learned but didn’t?”
Next time you are asked to do the impossible, just smile and start running!
Planning for Today’s Diverse Learners
As noted in the ASTD Competency Study, the future holds a more diverse
workforce. Several factors contribute to this. The combination of an aging
workforce whose hopes for early retirement have been dashed by an eco-
nomic downturn find themselves working beside “Gen-Next-ers.” Implications
for training are obvious. The MTV generation may challenge more and have a
shorter attention span. The near-retirement crowd may need to unlearn cur-
rent practices first, thus taking longer, and may experience a decline in their
vision or hearing.
Trainers may need to balance different pace preferences, different comfort
levels with technology, and different levels of self-confidence.
Diversity will be displayed in other cultural differences including race, gender,
ethnicity, and affiliations. Trainers will need to select materials and media,
such as case studies and videos, that reflect a diverse audience and eliminate
gender-specific language.
As a trainer, make an effort to learn about those from other cultures. Learn
to pronounce names correctly. Respect personal preferences. If participants
have written Ms. or Dr. on their table tents, there is a strong preference to be
addressed in the more formal context. Recognize that a highly participative
learning approach may be uncomfortable for some cultures. Some cultures do
not view direct eye contact as positively as those who live in the United States. 
Diverse cultures require additional effort. A diverse audience requires that
trainers speak clearly, are careful about giving feedback, frequently check
for understanding, give instructions in the same sequence they are to be fol-
lowed, avoid single country references, take care with jokes or other offen-
sive remarks, and repeat information when necessary.
321
Chapter 17: Training Trends

Unique differences occur in any language. For example, using the colloquial-
ism of “Are you pulling a fast one?” does not make much sense to someone
just learning the language. Say instead, “Are you trying to trick me?” Similarly,
sarcasm may be misunderstood as well. “Sure it is!” stated sarcastically will
be better understood if you say, “I don’t think that is correct.”
Read a book that identifies common gestures and their meanings in other cul-
tures. For example, a thumbs-up signal that to you indicates everything is
okay is a rude gesture in Nigeria and Australia.
Participants who have disabilities will also add diversity to your training ses-
sion. Be sure that you use the word disabled or the specific disability (as
opposed to handicapped). Some disabilities may not be visible but may still
create learning challenges, for example, dyslexia or diabetes.
Trainers cannot learn everything there is to know about disabilities. However,
you should try to accommodate special needs. Attend to environmental
aspects such as lighting, noise levels, refreshments served, and seating
arrangements. Never assume anything, and get information about special
needs prior to the training session. Identify what you can do to maximize the
learning experience for everyone.
Having a diverse training group is a certainty. Equally as certain is that diver-
sity will change the way your organization provides training. 
Professional trainers deal with many different situations. Dealing with diver-
sity in the classroom provides an opportunity to model appropriate behavior
for participants. Participants who see trainers working effectively with a
diverse group may see the benefits and learn skills through observation.
As with any profession, nothing is static. It makes me think of the words to
Bob Dylan’s song, “The times they are a changing.”

Ten Tips to Start Off 
on the Right Foot
In This Chapter
 Learning how trainers catch and hold participants’ attention
 Reviewing ten items a trainer accomplishes in the opening of a training session
F
irst contacts create a lasting impression. Most people have discovered
that the first ten minutes of any initial meeting between two people lays
the groundwork for almost all assumptions and decisions about the ensuing
relationship. 
If first impressions are critical, how does a good trainer catch and hold par-
ticipants’ attention from the start? How do trainers start off on the right foot?
This chapter identifies ten aspects of getting your training session off to a
good start. 
The American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) offers a Training
Certificate Program. One of the objectives of the program is to teach trainers
how to open their training sessions with PUNCH. ASTD believes that the
opening is one of the most important sections of any training design. Training
should open with a purpose, not just open. A training session can open with
PUNCH if the trainer accomplishes these five things.
 Promotes interest and enthusiasm for the training-session content.
Participants desire more after the opening. Perhaps there was an ele-
ment of surprise built into the opening using props or introducing a cre-
ative activity.
 Understands participants’ needs — both content as well as personal-
esteem needs — by learning something about participants’ experience
and expertise.
 Notes the ground rules and administrative needs so that guidelines are
established to ensure the training session runs more smoothly: what
time lunch will be held, when breaks will occur, and where restrooms are
located.

 Clarifies expectations by discussing the agenda and the objectives for
the session. The opening also identifies other expectations participants
have that may or may not be addressed.
 Helps everyone get to know each other through the use of icebreakers,
discussions, or other activities. Getting participation early sets the stage
for full participation throughout the session.
How do you add PUNCH to your training? These ten aspects of starting off on
the right foot guide you in the right direction.
Establish a Climate Conducive
to Learning
Creating rapport and establishing a climate conducive to learning cannot be
overemphasized. When done right from the start, it means that participants
will be open to and enthusiastic about the learning events that follow. They
will know what to expect. You can set the tone for the rest of the training ses-
sion by what you accomplish at the beginning. 
The opening should indicate whether the rest of the session will have partici-
pants up and moving about or sitting or a combination of the two. It should
set the tempo and tone of the session. Fast paced? Slow? Jovial? Serious?
Interactive? Passive? Creative? Cerebral? Exciting? Calm? All of these describe a
potential training climate. Decide what yours will be, and then begin to estab-
lish the climate during your opening.
If you desire a participative climate, the opening should put people at ease —
including the trainer. Participants may be reluctant to get involved unless the
trainer provides structure that includes a purpose. They may be shy or may
not want to appear vulnerable in front of their peers or strangers.
Think through the climate that will be the most conducive to learning. Then
begin to establish it from the first moment the session begins.
Clarify Participants’ Expectations
Participants expect you to ask about their expectations for the session, and
numerous ways exist for you to accomplish this. Of course, the most straight-
forward way is to simply ask, “What are your expectations for the session?”
List them on a flipchart page and post them on the wall. There are other ways
to get the same information. You can twist the question a bit to assist learn-
ers to get at their questions or concerns from a different perspective. Try
some of these.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Ask for hopes and fears. Post on two different flipcharts.
 Ask for dreams and desires.
 Ask “Why are you here?”
 Ask “What questions did you bring with you today?”
 Ask “What do you need to happen today for this training to be worth
your investment of time?”
 Ask “How well do your needs match the learning objectives?” and “What
else do you need?”
What if the participants’ expectations go beyond the scope of the training
design? Better to let them know now how you intend to handle it. You may
respond in three ways. First, you can add time to the agenda to address the
additional expectations. This most likely means eliminating or shortening
something else. Second, if the additional expectation is something that con-
cerns only one or two individuals, you may choose to meet with them after
the session or during a break to discuss their needs. Third, you may need to
tell them that you’re not prepared or time doesn’t allow for the added con-
tent, or whatever is the truth, but that you will follow up with them following
the session. This may mean that you e-mail them additional resources, put
them in touch with someone who has the expertise, or whatever will address
their concern.
Possibly the most important thing you can do for participants is to help them
understand “What’s In It For Me” (WIIFM). Some trainers describe this as
helping participants tune into station WII-FM. Participants who understand
why they are involved in a training session, how it will help them do their
jobs better and faster, and how the content relates to them will get more out
of the training session.
Introduce the Content
Related to clarifying the participants’ expectations is introducing the content.
You provide an overview for participants by reviewing the agenda and the
objectives for the training session. Telling them what’s to come provides a
foundation for the content and establishes a common starting point for
everyone in the room. 
Ensure that participants know other aspects of the content as well. They may
want to know whether they will be required to take a test, whether they will
receive a grade for the course, or whether the grade will affect their jobs.
They may want to know what kind of participation will be expected and
whether there will be assignments. Explain each of these as you walk them
through the agenda.

Chapter 18: Ten Tips to Start Off on the Right Foot

I generally present the content and then ask participants whether they were
anticipating different or additional content. You can do either first. I find my
process saves time because I do not have to repeat the content later as I pre-
sent the agenda. On the other hand, sometimes it is more important for the
participants to establish their own agenda than to save time. During instances
such as a team-building effort, I facilitate a discussion of their expectations
and needs first. It takes a bit longer, but there is more buy-in that leads to
better end results.
Surprise!
Add an element of surprise right from the start. Add something unconven-
tional to send a message to participants that this session may not be the
same thing they have experienced in the past. You may introduce props in
your opening or state something unusual or shocking about the topic (that
you can prove later, of course). You can also start with an activity first, rather
than addressing the logistics of the session. 
 During introductions, most trainers start at the front and go clockwise
around the room. Plan to start someplace else, such as the middle back
and go counterclockwise. Even better, ask for a volunteer to start, ask
for a second volunteer, and select or call on folks all over. This takes a
bit of practice on your part to remember who was introduced. When all
else fails, you can always end by saying, “Who has not been introduced
yet?” to pick up anyone who was missed in this scatter approach.
 Save housekeeping issues until just before break. No one needs to know
most of the information until then anyway. Because most sessions start
off with a discussion about lunch, parking, and sign-up sheets, you will
surprise your participants when you do not begin the same way.
 Ask participants to use crayons instead of pens or pencils to generate
lists, draw something, write their names on their table tents, or anything
else they would typically complete with a pen.
Doing something just a bit differently or in a different sequence introduces an
element of surprise that energizes participants, adds interest and excitement
to the session, and communicates that this session will not be boring.
Introduce Participants
An opening is not complete unless participants learn who else is attending
the session. Whether you use an icebreaker or a quick round of introductions
will depend on the amount of time you have available and how participants
will need to interact during the rest of the training session. 
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Allow participants to become acquainted with one another. Establish a way
that they can begin to understand who else is in the training session and
what their attitudes, values, experience, and concerns may be. Use this time
wisely. Before selecting how participants will meet each other, determine
what you want participants to be able to do as a result. You may just want
them to be able to match names and faces, but you may want to consider
other results that will help to further the training session. What else do you
want participants to know about each other? Make a list of what you want to
accomplish. These may help get you started.
 Have a continuous contact for other content.
 Practice solving problems.
 Understand attitudes, beliefs, likes, and dislikes.
 Practice a creative experience.
 Begin to build a team.
Many legitimate aspects exist for what you hope participants will learn about
each other and how they will interact later based on this introduction experi-
ence. At the least, I suggest that everyone in the group accomplish two things. 
 All participants hear all other participants’ names. 
 All participants speak up at least once.
This is a good time to mention the use of table tents — the cards folded like a
tent that have people’s names written on them. Use them; they will help you
remember participants’ names and help participants remember and use each
others’ names. Have participants place their names on both sides during the
introductions. This allows you and other participants to see their names from
any angle.
Learn About the Group
Be sure to build time into the opening so that you can observe the group and
learn something about the group’s dynamics and the individual personalities.
Conducting an icebreaker provides you with this opportunity. 
It may be tempting to have your head in your notes during the icebreaker to
prepare for the next section. If you do, you will be doing participants and
yourself a disservice.
Take time to determine how you perceive the group as a whole. Circulate
among the participants, observing how they work together. Listen to conver-
sations. Who seems to be taking the lead? Who is still reluctant to join in?
What strong personalities exist in the group? Who seems to be dominating
the discussion?
329
Chapter 18: Ten Tips to Start Off on the Right Foot

This time gives you a chance to think ahead to the rest of the design and to be
aware of potential difficulties where you may consider changing the process.
For example, if you have planned a risky activity and the group appears to be
risk-adverse, you may make a mental note about it. It is certainly too early to
make the change now, but you may give yourself a personal heads-up that a
change may be required.
Make it a practice to use this time to discover as much about the group and
individuals as you can. 
Establish Ground Rules
Establishing ground rules as a part of your opening shapes the parameters of
behavior the participants expect of each other and from the trainer for the
session. I generally present the group with a few to get started, or the givens,
such as start and end time. (See Chapter 9 for suggested ground-rule catego-
ries.) I sometimes make a commitment such as “If we start on time each day
(or after each break), I guarantee we will end on time.”
Capture the same words that participants have used. You need buy-in to the
ground rules from everyone, so you may need to modify the list in order to
get agreement.
As you facilitate development of the ground rules, be sure to refer to respon-
sibility for them. For example, while establishing ground rules, I may make
the point that the participants must share in the responsibility of learning,
emphasizing that my role is to present content and that their responsibility is
to ask questions if I have not been clear or did not provide enough informa-
tion.
Post the ground rules in a location where everyone can see them, usually
near the front of the training room. This facilitates your ability to reference
them if you need to use them to manage disruptions or as a reference point
to facilitate group dynamics.
Confront Any Issues
If you know issues exist around the training session, confront them during
the opening and plan time to address them. In fact, your icebreaker may
incorporate the concerns.
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If something is happening in the organization that led to this training session,
address it head on. If it is troublesome to participants, allow enough time to
discuss. You will find that if you do not address it immediately, participants
will not be able to focus on the content you’re presenting. And besides, you
will most likely address it later anyway.
Establish Your Credibility and Style
Just as you want to know about participants, the participants will be trying to
learn something about you, your expectations, your style, and your credibil-
ity. You have a number of things to cover in the introduction. How you cover
them and in what order will tell the participants as much about your expecta-
tions as anything. You will be modeling your style. My preference is to weave
them in throughout different parts of the opening.
If participants have not met you before, they will want to know something
about you. Begin to share something about yourself during the opening. If
you ask participants to divulge something about themselves during an ice-
breaker, you should divulge the same information. If you ask them to draw a
picture that depicts something about them, you should draw a picture, too.
This ensures that you share the same information that they do. It also keeps
you at a similar level with your participants. Follow Rudyard Kipling’s advice:
“Don’t lose the common touch.” Let people know you care about their suc-
cess and that you’re there to guide them; as someone once told me, be a
“guide on the side, not a sage on stage.” You will be a more successful trainer
if you’re genuine.
Your expectations for the time together may be covered at the same time that
the group establishes its ground rules. Be sure that you build your expecta-
tions in as well. For example, if you expect the participants to assist with bal-
ancing participation, say so. If you do not, many participants will assume that
it is your job to manage all disruptive behaviors. Be sure participants under-
stand your expectations up front.
Your style will come across in the opening — whether you want it to or not.
Participants observe how you approach the opening and will make assump-
tions about your style. Did you take time to listen to participants and clarify
what they meant? Did you check your watch? 
Some trainers use a bio sketch or have someone else introduce them to
establish their credibility. Credibility is a combination of what you know
(your expertise), what you have done (your experience), and how you pre-
sent yourself. Those who present themselves best come across as humbly
331
Chapter 18: Ten Tips to Start Off on the Right Foot

self-confident. I try to avoid having someone introduce me. If I cannot avoid
it, I make sure that it is short and appropriately related to the training I am
about to present. I like to add a personal element or a lighthearted statement
that relates to the participants. For example, I may say that I have been con-
ducting training for more years than I want to admit. To establish credibility, I
will mention my experience and expertise as introductions to stories. I may
say, for example, “One of the things I have learned working in the manufactur-
ing arena for the past 20 years is. . . .” This statement has the same effect as
reading it from a resume but is more subtle and is positioned where it makes
more sense to the participants.
Take a Break!
Yes, take a break. If the opening was an hour in length, take a break. It main-
tains the energy level, gives participants an opportunity to follow up with
other participants, and gives people a chance to take care of personal needs
before you begin the content.
Remember, your opening is one of the most important segments of your
training session. Be sure it adds PUNCH to the entire design.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Increase
Participation
In This Chapter
 Identifying practical ways to increase participant involvement 
 Ensuring that increased participation also increases the learning that occurs
“L
earning is not a spectator sport!” Quoting John Newstrom, coauthor
of the Games Trainers Play series, he is quite serious about the pur-
pose of increasing involvement through games or any other means. Retention
is enhanced with an increase in participants’ involvement.
Increasing participation is something that the trainer controls. And it all
comes down to being prepared. The topic of increasing participation has
been woven throughout this book. From a big-picture perspective, it includes
such things as creating and maintaining a safe learning environment, being
flexible enough to accommodate the range of needs and preferences in the
room, and appealing to all learning modes.
The ideas presented in this chapter include how to lay the foundation of a
participative environment, how to build on that foundation with participative
activities, how to frame your comments to encourage participation, and how
to continue constructing a participative session.
Begin to Encourage Participation
Right from the Start
Creating and maintaining a safe environment starts the moment the first partic-
ipant enters the room — no matter what time it is. Greet the first person, intro-
duce yourself, and learn something about him or his drive to the session or
other local information. As participants continue to arrive, introduce yourself
to as many as you can. Invite them to have a cup of coffee if available. This
small gesture sets the stage for creating an environment that encourages learn-
ing and participation. It demonstrates that you are open, accessible, human!

Once the session starts, get people up, moving about, and participating in the
first few minutes. The icebreaker should at the least provide an opportunity
for everyone to get to know each other by name. Don’t immediately worry
about the logistical information (location of the bathrooms and the time for
lunch); however, be sure that you take care of it before the first break.
Also, as a part of your introduction, express your interest in and the value of
participation and the benefits of learning from one another. Ensure that par-
ticipants have an opportunity to express their needs and/or expectations of
the session. If you do these things, you will lay the foundation that encour-
ages participation right from the start.
Cards for the Shy and Faint of Heart
Index cards can be a lifesaver for increasing participation. The participants
in your sessions have different communication styles and preferences. Some
participants are forming their thoughts as they quickly respond. Some need
time to think about their responses before they say anything. And some par-
ticipants just do not like to speak up at all. Most will respond if they have had
time to think about what they will say. Unfortunately, if you ask a question,
at least one-third of your participants will have an answer ready before the
question mark punctuates it. 
If you want everyone to have time to think about their responses to a ques-
tion without being influenced by others in the session, have everyone jot
down their answers on index cards. Then call on those first who usually do
not speak up first. This is safe for the quieter participants because they have
had time to think about their responses.
You may use index cards to increase participation in many ways. These are a
few of my favorites.
 Take a poll.
 Ask for an opinion.
 Ask for their concerns, questions, or issues.
 Administer a mini-quiz (keep it fun).
 Conduct a midcourse evaluation.
What to do with the cards? Try these. 
 Collect and compile them and report the responses. 
 Collect, shuffle, and redistribute them, having participants read the card
each received to the rest of the group. 
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Pass them around the room and ask participants to add more informa-
tion or answer the questions; then read them or return them to the origi-
nal authors. 
 Collect, sort, and prioritize the cards to create a customized learning
module.
Give Your Role Away
Find ways in which participants can take on the role of the trainer. A good
trainer acknowledges that the collective group of participants in the room
knows more than any single trainer. Creating ways that allow participants to
take on the training role is a great way to gain participation and distribute the
wealth of knowledge. 
 Ask someone to facilitate a discussion. You can give the discussion a
format; for example, ask how participants will apply this to their jobs.
 Encourage participants to speak with each other, rather than directing
all comments to you. For example, if Maggie asks a question, ask Mario
to respond by saying, “Mario, how would you answer Maggie?” After a
few times, participants view this as “permission” to converse as a group.
If the discussion is going well, you may even want to sit down or move
to a side wall, providing further evidence that you approve.
 Have participants form teams of three or four participants and write
review questions in an attempt to stump the other teams. Keep score
numerically or use a graphic such as the old “hangman” game to track
errors or a baseball diamond to track “hits.”
 Assign various sections of the content to small groups who create and
present the information. This not only allows for more participation,
but it also demonstrates that the participants know the material. You
can always add a fine point if something is missed at the end of the 
presentations.
Participation; Repeat, Participation 
As you gain verbal participation, you want it to continue. How do you ensure
that those who got involved and spoke up once or twice will continue? And
how do you get those who have not been involved to jump on the participa-
tion wagon, too?
How you respond to participants who contribute to the session can encour-
age them to repeat their involvement and will serve as a model for those who
have not yet participated. Try these three things.
335
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Increase Participation

 Thank the participant for the contribution. Use the person’s name and
make eye contact.
 Restate the comment and expand upon it. You can also use it later in the
session: “As Suki mentioned earlier. . . .”
 Acknowledge the contribution and then encourage others to add to a
response or to share a different perspective. If it is a different perspective,
always return to original participants to affirm their initial contribution.
On Your Feet!
Move participants around to encourage discussions with other participants.
Physical movement keeps the blood flowing to the brain and prevents the
afternoon blahs. In addition, you will find participation will increase.
 Form small groups. You do participants no favors by keeping them in
the same area of the room. Most new groups you form should have a dif-
ferent number of people, include different participants, and be located in
a different place in the room. If the room is large enough, have tables set
around the room with chairs so that you can occasionally direct groups
to the tables.
 Include activities that have people standing. Relay races, moving groups
from place to place, recording information on a flipchart, or portions of a
game show, for example Jeopardy!, in which reviews could be completed
while standing.
 Post flipcharts with issues and have participants move around in pairs
to address and add their comments. Sharon Bowman is a firm believer in
moving participants around. She conducts an activity she calls a gallery
walk. Participants complete an activity on a flipchart page and hang it in a
hallway. Groups visit the charts and may add written comments to them.
This allows people a different location and different vantage point. It may
even encourage seeing the information from a different perspective.
 Have participants stand for part of your presentation, but be sure you
have a reason. You could conduct a verbal pop quiz in which partici-
pants could find someone in the room who knows the answer. You could
have them discuss something in pairs and constantly change the pairs.
Say a Lot without a Word
Certainly what you say verbally, your compliments, thanks, paraphrases,
elaborations, and even your disagreements, will encourage participation.
However, your body language may speak louder than words. Use the power
of nonverbal communication to encourage participation.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Use physical body language: Make eye contact with all participants. Fleeting
eye contact will not obtain the involvement you desire. Allow your eyes to
linger. Nodding your head shows that you understand and encourages partic-
ipants to continue. Avoid defensive postures such as folding your arms. Stop
talking and do not interrupt. Avoid distracting movements. Get out from
behind a table (never use a podium) and move toward people to draw them
into the discussion. Don’t just listen. You need to look like you’re listening.
Avoid checking your watch — even if you’re innocently trying to determine
the time. 
Learn to determine the time without obviously looking for it. For example, you
could practice reaching for something (a glass of water, your notes) while steal-
ing a glance at your watch. Or you can have your watch or other clock sitting
unobtrusively on the table. I like to use the plastic stick-on clocks that are
slightly larger than a quarter and stick them to the projector.
Don’t just say you are interested. Look like you’re interested. Later prove that
you heard what was said by reiterating the comment or building on the idea
with comments such as “Marlo’s question earlier. . .” or “To build on what
Andre suggested. . . .”
Remove the Tables
I use this technique when I really want to heat up the environment and send a
message that the participation stakes have been raised considerably. Remove
the tables from the participants. You may take them out of the room or push
them against a wall in the room. I usually do this while participants are out 
of the room: during a lunch break or at the end of a day if participants are
returning the next day. You could have participants assist if you want. I place
the chairs in a circle, leaving only one chair width open for participants to
move in or out of the circle.
This arrangement creates an informal atmosphere and encourages a high
level of participation. The drawback is that participants no longer have a
place to write. Plan this technique carefully in your design. Tearing down and
resetting tables can use up quite a bit of time. So it may be possible that you
have little writing and more group activity during a specific portion of your
training session, that is, a full afternoon or even between the final break for
the day and the end of the session. This allows you to reset the tables before
the next day’s session.
Attention-Getting Answers
When asking questions, don’t stop at the first answer — even if it is correct.
This is a great way to start an interesting dialogue and get participants’
337
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Increase Participation

minds engaged. The other more obvious reason is that those who have the
fast, right answer will do most of the talking. Pausing after answers — even
right ones — is a unique way to encourage more participation.
Sometimes when participants answer a question, you may feel a need to sim-
plify their roundabout answer. If it is necessary, you could on occasion say,
“Gee, I must be a bit slow today. Could you explain that again?” Two things
will happen. First, you encourage the participant to reexamine the response
and simplify it for the group. Second, you will gain the group’s attention as
members are drawn into the challenge you have just presented.
Use round robins regularly to encourage a word or two from everyone.
Ensure that the responses asked for are short. For example, “Tell me one
thing required for excellent customer service.”
The Quietest
After the environment in a training session seems to be safe for even the
shyest person, I request that the group decide at the beginning of the
assigned activity who in the group has spoken the least up to that point in
the session. The chosen individual will be the person who leads and/or
reports out for the small group. Don’t wait too long to use this technique. I
am always surprised about the increased participation from that previously
“quiet” person.
Participation Right to the End
There is no need for you to take over at the end. End your session with as
much participation as you started. Ask participants to share something. 
 One action each will implement immediately
 The most interesting fact they learned
 New questions they have as a result of the training session
Allow time for participants to say goodbye to others in the session. This
could be an informal walkabout, or participants could have an assignment
such as writing and distributing messages to others. If consistent teams were
utilized throughout the session, have the teams create a goodbye skit, song,
or cheer to present to the larger group. Encourage continued participation by
distributing contact information for all participants.

Ten Ways to Save Time 
in the Training Room
In This Chapter
 Identifying ways to save time while encouraging participation
 Identifying ways to catch up if you have fallen behind schedule
 Determining how to save time without diminishing learning 
A
s a trainer, you will want to keep everything moving along in your ses-
sion. You recognize the importance of maximizing participation yet are
concerned about how much time you have available. At times you may need
to address issues that your learners are focused on before you move forward
with the designed learning experience.
 How do you save time while increasing participation?
 How do you save time without diminishing any learning experiences?
 How do you catch up if you have fallen behind schedule?
Consider the Relationship 
of Time to Small Groups
If you need to save time during the small-group exercise, form more groups
with fewer people. A smaller group will accomplish the task faster than a
large group. If you need to save time during the report-out stage, form fewer
groups with more people. You will have fewer reports to hear.
You could also have groups report just one item at a time in a round-robin
fashion. You save time because duplicate ideas are not reported.

Groups may be able to summarize their ideas on flipchart pages posted
around the room. All ideas can be viewed and discussed by the large group.
Depending on the activity, each group could select the one or two best ideas
to report on. All ideas on flipcharts are viewed as participants leave for or
return from break. 
One Activity, Two (or More) Objectives
Time. There is never enough of it. Therefore, way back in the beginning of
your training cycle begin to think about how you can save time in the design.
One of the obvious ones is to use one activity to achieve two or more objec-
tives. For example, participants may be practicing the skills used to conduct
performance evaluations. Observers could be taking notes about how well
the process was demonstrated. They could also be observing how nonverbal
communication affected the skill practice. The next module may be about
communication. Later in the day when you want to discuss feedback, you
could ask the folks who received feedback from their observers, “What
worked; what didn’t?” One activity, three different skills.
You may also save time by using “work” that participants need to complete
back on the job. When I work with teams, I use real-life projects that they
need to accomplish as the basis for creating experiences in which they can
evaluate their effectiveness as a team. In your design consider whether par-
ticipants could bring projects with them to complete as a part of an activity.
Gentle Prods
When you establish small groups to complete a task or activity, always assign
a specific amount of time to complete the task. But people lose track of time.
The task needs to be completed in order for the learning to occur. First, be
sure that you have designed the appropriate amount of time to complete the
task. If you’re sure of that, you may do two things to help groups stay on time.
First, you could ask them to select a timekeeper within their groups to
manage time.
Second, you may wish to give them time cues throughout the task. Examples
may include these:
 “You should have started the second step.”
 “You should be halfway through the task.”
 “How much time do you need to finish?”
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 “The second person in your group should be providing feedback.”
 “You have about five minutes to go.”
 “You should be wrapping up.”
 “Sixty seconds left.”
These gentle prods keep the groups moving and on time.
Different Pace for Different Folks
Always plan a reasonable amount of time in a training design so that it can
be completed. However, in real life, some participants simply take more time
to complete individual projects than others. If you have a design element
where you expect that to occur — for example, completing a self-assessment
or quiz — schedule it just prior to a break. 
Those who finish early can leave and those who take longer have control over
whether they would like to continue at the same pace or try to wrap up more
quickly. Those who use most of the break time to complete the task may return
late to the session. Again, that is a decision they make, and you should not
delay the start if they are still out of the room.
Don’t forget to also use the gentle prods throughout the activity to keep them
informed of how much time is available.
Divvy Up the Work 
All work doesn’t need to be completed by all people. If a small-group activity
is not dependent upon a specific sequence, assign different groups to com-
plete different parts of the activity. For example, if I have given a group a
worksheet that has a list of concepts or components, I will ask some of the
small groups to start at the top and work down and some of the groups to
start at the bottom and work up. Sometimes, just for fun, I ask one of the
groups to start in the middle and go either way. 
All of the concepts or components are addressed by one group or another.
Learning is not lost because everyone becomes familiar with all of the com-
ponents of the activity during the debriefing. During the debriefing I encour-
age all groups to take notes about what the other groups have produced.
341
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Save Time in the Training Room

The Time Is Now
Time cannot be bottled to save for the future, so use it well. You cannot save
time. Don’t waste it. Use your time resource wisely.
 Start the session on time.
 Start on time after every break.
 Distribute materials and handouts efficiently. If participants are sitting in
a U shape, start stacks at both ends and in the back middle. If partici-
pants are at separate tables, place the right number of materials for
each table in stacks prior to the start of the session or at breaks.
 Watch carefully the time you spend in large-group discussion. Time can
run away from you here. Establish time limits for discussions that are
either scheduled or unscheduled.
 You do not need to hear from every person every time. If you skip a
group or individual, catch them on the next question.
Be Prepared
Examine your behaviors to ensure that you’re as well prepared as possible
and that you’re not the cause for falling behind. 
 Provide clear, concise, complete directions. You may be held up by a
group that hasn’t finished because they did not understand the instruc-
tions. If the instructions are complex, put them in writing.
 Prepare your flipcharts and other visuals before the session begins.
 Be sure you know the objective of the discussion. When the point is
made, move on. Don’t let discussions drag on.
 Test new activities with colleagues to estimate the timing.
 If you don’t want participants to worry when you’re behind, put only
general times on their agendas; for example, break the agenda up based
on morning and afternoon.
 Provide examples that will give small-group discussions a jump-start.
Cut Out the Fat
Examine the training. Understand the objectives and your audience well
enough so that you know what information is “must know” and what informa-
tion is “nice to know.” Then be prepared to cut out anything that is “nice to
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

know” when you’re short of time. I usually identify the least important activ-
ity in each module so that I can set priorities as I go along.
Do job aids exist for some of the content? If yes, you probably can cut some
time out in that area by providing the information once and then referring to
the job aid for future use.
Often, training materials have lists of things to do or remember. When I get
to a page of lists, I ask participants to grab a marker or pen and highlight or
circle the ones that I think are essential for them to remember. This provides
a quick way to address the list in a time-efficient way.
When prioritizing what to keep, remember to keep anything that will help
them learn more after the session or help them find information later. No one
remembers everything they learn in a training session. However, if they know
how to find the information later, you will have done your job.
Use Timekeepers
You may wish to act as a timekeeper yourself. Or assign timekeepers to small
groups to ensure that the groups finish their tasks on time.
You can use timekeepers during breaks. Ask for a volunteer who will round
up people who have not returned from break. Sometimes, just closing the
door to the training room signals those who have lost track of time that the
session is ready to start again.
Pre-Training Strategies
Face-to-face time in the training room is getting shorter and shorter. Therefore,
you may wish to consider how you can use time before the training begins. You
could, for example, assign pre-reading, electronic tutorials, or exercises to the
participants. 
Pay close attention to the training assessment to identify skill level, experi-
ence, and special needs. Doing so ensures that you’re prepared for the varia-
tion within the group.
Add techniques to support the training. You may need to develop checklists,
job aids, e-mail tips, Web-based learning, brownbag sessions, mentors or user
support groups or plan to introduce a buddy system during the training.

time” to express opinions, add ideas, and ask questions.
 Small groups allow individuals to receive feedback more quickly.
 Small groups allow participants to learn from each other.
 Small groups create opportunities for more people to practice skills or
apply knowledge at the same time.
 Learning becomes more dynamic and active in small groups.
 Small groups encourage participants to know each other better, breaking
down barriers and creating a more positive learning atmosphere.
Small groups are a great way to encourage participation, but using the grade-
school method of counting off by fours or fives is not a very creative process.
You will actually find more than ten ways to form small groups because there
are several variations to each theme.
Whatever technique you use to form small groups, there is only one decision
you need to make. Which is more important, how many groups you have,
how many people are in each group, or neither one? Let me give you a couple
of examples. 

 The activity may require a trio, such as a role-play between two people
plus an observer. You need three people in each group, but it doesn’t
matter how many groups.
 The activity may have five areas, each to be covered by a small group.
You need five groups, but it doesn’t matter how many people are in each. 
 Sometimes, you can provide flexibility such that participants can select
their own groups, but you still have enough control so that everything
is covered. For example, you may have five issues posted on flipcharts
that need to be addressed. You could say, “To form small groups, stand
next to the issue you want to address. When five people are standing
next to one issue, stand next to your second choice.” In this case, if you
had 22 people in your session, all five issues would be covered, and
potentially the smallest group would have two members. Most often, the
distribution is quite even.
What if you don’t have the exact number of people? Additional participants
can always be observers. If there are too few, you may fill in occasionally,
although this is not a preference of mine because it takes you away from
other groups who may need your assistance.
A little planning before you form small groups ensures that the participants
will be successful and all content is addressed.
Arrange participants in small groups prior to giving activity instructions. If
you begin with activity instructions and follow with instructions about how
you want small groups to form, many participants will have forgotten the ini-
tial instructions by the time they have settled into their small groups.
Count Off
Of course you can count off. But do it backward instead. To break into five
groups, count off backward from five, “five, four, three, two, one, five.” Be
sure to stay with the group. Adults can get really confused on this one!
You may also teach participants to count to five in a foreign language —
Spanish, German, French, Chinese — and ask them to count off in their new lan-
guage. This adds a nice touch if the language is one of your participant’s first
language. It also creates interesting discussion in a diversity training session.
If one of your goals is to provide participants with the opportunity to meet
and work with a variety of people, change small-group formations from activ-
ity to activity.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Noise Level
Identify sounds that participants could make to form small groups. For exam-
ple, have participants think of the first vowel sound in their names. Have
them make that sound and find others making that same vowel sound. When
they find their group, they find a place to sit prior to receiving instructions.
You could have participants think of their favorite color. Have everyone stand
and say their color out loud, finding others who are saying the same color.
Have participants think of the last digit of their phone number. Have them
say the number until they find others with the same number. Realize that you
may have ten small groups anytime you request something as open-ended as
this one. You may also have participants whose digit doesn’t match anyone’s.
Quickly pair up strays or assign them to one of the smaller groups that has
already formed.
Go to Your Corners
Identify reasons for people to go to separate places in the training room. For
example, you could have them go to one of four corners depending on
whether they are a first born, last born, middle, or only child in their family.
They could go to the corner of the room that is closest to the direction they
would head to go home (as a crow flies). 
You can connect the corners to content. For example, if you’re training a
business-communication class, you could have them select the method of
communication they prefer, for example, e-mail, face-to-face, telephone, or
notes.
Personal Data
Form small groups based on some tiny piece of data about them. You could
use birthdays for four groups by using first, second, third, and fourth quar-
ters of the year. Several others are last digit in their Social Security numbers,
color of shoes they are wearing, favorite season, first letter of their middle
name, or height. For the last two, have participants stand in order (alphabeti-
cally or by height) and then split at the quarter or one-fifth point depending
on how many groups you desire. If you need two groups, form groups of
those wearing glasses or not.
347
Chapter 21: Ten Quick Ways to Form Small Groups

Note that you may need to modify some of these to achieve the number of
groups you need for your activity. Even better, come up with your own ideas.
Secret Codes
Code the participants’ materials in various ways. Purchase stickers and place
them on the training materials, under the participants’ chairs, on the outside
or inside of the table tents, or on name tags. If you distribute a limited number
of different-color markers for participants to use to write their names on their
table tents, you can refer to the color marker they choose. Handouts for an
activity can be copied on different colors of paper. Put participants into
groups based on the color of paper they choose. You may also write numbers
or letters on the back of participant notebooks. Use several colors of pens or
folders.
Puzzling Participants
Purchase or make four- to six-piece puzzles. Participants select a puzzle piece
and find the rest of the pieces to their puzzle to form a small group. More
puzzle pieces than participants? Paper-clip two pieces together from the
same puzzle. 
Small blank puzzles are available from a party goods or office supply store.
Add a personal message that is revealed after the small group puts all its
pieces together.
Puzzles do not always have to “fit” together physically. You could write the
names of people (or fictional characters) who “fit” together on index cards.
You could use, for example, Alice, Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and the Queen of
Hearts; or you could use Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, and Pig Pen. You could
select television characters, political figures, movie characters, or even
“characters” from your organization.
Dog Days
Put people into small groups using sounds. Use as many index cards as you
have people. Determine how many people you want in each group. Then
write the same sound on each card. For example, you have 20 people in your
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

session and you want groups of four. If you select dog sounds, write “woof
woof” on four cards, write “yap yap” on four cards, write “arf, arf” on four
cards, and write “ruff ruff” and “bark bark” on the rest. Have participants
stand and tell them that when you say go, they should walk around the room
and find the other dogs that are speaking the same language. If you use this
in a communication session, you can create all sorts of language analogies.
You can vary this by using familiar songs: “Happy Birthday,” “Jingle Bells,”
“Row, Row, Row Your Boat,” and so on. You could use sounds you make with-
out opening your mouth: humming, clapping, snapping your fingers, stomp-
ing, and so on. You could also use advertising slogans, different animal
sounds, words from business: “You’ve got mail,” “One moment please,” “If
this is correct, please press one,” and so on. Sounds made by vehicles, instru-
ments. Well, you get the idea. I suggest that unless you have a strong risk-
taking group, you may not want to use it until after the first day.
Small Groups Where None Dares to Go
All the techniques are great you say, but what about the times that you’re
(unfortunately) providing training in a classroom setting. You know the one
with long tables, everyone facing the front of the room, furniture so close par-
ticipants can barely move between rows? Do what you can with what you
have. The best idea is to have the odd-numbered rows turn to the back of the
room, facing participants in the even-numbered rows. Decide whether you
want small groups of two, four, or six and have participants split the groups
accordingly.
If you want participants to work with different people the next time, have the
even-numbered rows turn to the back of the room. And if you really want to
mix things up, you can have everyone get up and rearrange the room to be
more suitable for learning. Just remember to be careful of what you ask for.
You’ll get a room that looks nothing like it did when you made the offer.
Pick a Prop
It takes a bit of preplanning, but there are hundreds of props you could bring
for forming groups. Trinket catalogs like Oriental Trading sells miniatures of
almost everything — toys, various-shaped erasers, cards, party favors, and
so on. You could bring miniature lifesaver candy or miniature candy bars in
different flavors. Have participants select one and then find the other individ-
uals who have selected the same (color, flavor, toy) whatever.
349
Chapter 21: Ten Quick Ways to Form Small Groups

I once took bubble-gum cards from four different sports: baseball, football,
basketball, and soccer. Participants were supposed to form the team of the
same sport. You could use a regular deck of playing cards. Sort the cards into
sets of matching numbers and have participants find their set. 
Using props works well around holidays, when it is easy to find little, inex-
pensive, yet cute items. You may use something as simple as colored index
cards or shapes cut from construction paper.
Make Mine Different
You don’t always need to form a group based on what is similar. You could
form by what is different. This is particularly good for times when you want
to form pairs and you have already had them work with the individuals to
their left and their right. 
Have participants find someone to work with who is different in some way.
Find a partner who has different-colored hair or eyes from yours. Wearing
shoes with laces? Find someone who is not. Find someone whose birthday is
in a different month from yours.

Ten Tips for Adding 
Humor to Training
In This Chapter
 Identifying ways to interject humor into a training session
 Avoiding bombs when telling a joke 
 Making humor a natural part of your presentation
T
homas Edison once said that he had never worked a day in his life. It was
all fun! Wouldn’t it be great if you could always say that? Adding humor to
your training is one way in which you can add fun to your participants’ days. 
I have always believed that people should not have to get up and go to work
in the morning. We should all love our jobs so much that we get up and go to
play each day. Learning should be like that. People seem to learn more when
they are having a good time. This chapter provides you with ideas for how to
add humor and fun to your training session, how to feel like everyone has
come to play for the day.
Laugh and Learn
When humor and playfulness are suppressed in traditional education and
training, other traits are lost as well. Creativity, imagination, and inventive-
ness have a hard time surviving in a mirthless environment. Incorporate
humor into a training session in several ways.
Use humor that matches your style. What works for your favorite stand-up
comedian or even another trainer may not work for you. Relate humor to
something that participants know. It is difficult to find humor in something
that must be explained.

Focus on funny stories as opposed to jokes. Stories usually fit into the flow of
events and have a purpose in training because they are generally used to make
a point. So even if your participants do not find the story funny, you have made
a point and not wasted participants’ time. Unless the trainer is very skilled,
jokes, on the other hand, tend to break the flow of the training. On top of that,
if the joke bombs, you may have wasted participants’ valuable time.
Relate humor to the training. Forget adding extraneous humor, such as an
irrelevant joke at the beginning. The best humor happens as a result of what
occurs naturally in the classroom. Trainers can have ready-to-go funny com-
ments that work when a certain situation pops up in a classroom. Trainers
can also relate humor to content in the session or to the processes used to
deliver the training. Trainers should also be ready to laugh at themselves.
Several ideas follow later in this chapter about how to build humor naturally
into the session.
Follow the lead of good comedians and paint a picture for participants. Using
concrete, real-world descriptions that relate to them helps them see and hear
the humor. 
Keep it simple. Shakespeare said, “Brevity is the soul of wit.”
Whatever humor you use, be sure to practice. Be sure to practice your punch
line. Be sure to practice your punch line with a pause just before it.
Start Off on a Funny Foot
Establish the atmosphere right from the start. Every session should start off
on a high note to set the stage for the rest of the session. Be positive. You
want to send the message that this will be fun. Your opening comments can
have some planted humor such as when I let participants know how long I
have been in the business.
Icebreakers are discussed elsewhere in this book. Icebreakers must induce a
sense of fun in the session. Icebreakers should never be drudgery for partici-
pants. I like to use props in the opening at some point. Icebreakers seem to
lend themselves to the use of props: blocks, t-shirts, bags, flashlights, tools,
or dozens of other things. 
Unless you are a professional comedian, forget the jokes. Tell a funny story
but no contrived jokes. If you bomb, it may seem like a long time until lunch.
When listing the ground rules in my training sessions, if someone says, “We
should have fun,” I grab a red marker and write over the top of all the rest of
the ground rules the word FUN, stating, “Above all, have fun.” This drives
home the message that I encourage humor and believe learning should be fun.
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Why add humor to the opening of a training session?
 Relieves nervousness participants may feel
 Establishes the environment for the rest of the session
 Gets participants’ attention
 Models that although the session is serious, the trainer does not neces-
sarily believe in being glum
I’m Lost!
Use humor to defuse unexpected situations. Here are some examples you
may want to try.
 If you lose your place or pause too long, you can say, “I just wanted to
wait a moment in case any of you have lost your place.” Steve Martin’s
favorite for this situation, “Where was I? Oh yes! I was here!” (Take a step
to the side.) Or, “I’m just going through a mental pause!”
 When you garble a sentence, you can say, “Later on I’ll pass out a
printed translation of that sentence.”
 If you tell a joke and it bombs, you could say, “Okay, I’ll just go back to
my desk (Wisconsin, home office, or wherever you call “home”) now!”
 If you are using a microphone and it goes dead, you can say, “Evidently
someone has heard this presentation before.”
 If people are talking during your presentation, you can say, “Feel free to
talk among yourselves.” Or, “I see you’re starting to break up into small
discussion groups ahead of me.”
 If someone points out you misspelled a word, you could say, “Mark
Twain once said he never respected anyone who couldn’t spell a word
more than one way!” Another response when informed you have mis-
spelled a word is to look around the flipchart as if you are missing some-
thing and then say, “Does anyone know where the spell check is on one
of these?”
Or my favorite. When I misspell a word or need to write a word that I
can’t spell on a flipchart, I quickly write 10 to12 arbitrary letters in an
empty corner of the flipchart, for example, Q, B, R, J, Z, D, N, A, and say,
“I’m not the best speller in the world, so if you notice that I have missed
a letter someplace, just take it from this group of letters and place it
wherever it belongs in the word!”
 If you give incorrect instructions, say, “Does everyone understand? Good.
Now forget it. That was just a test to see if you can follow instructions.
Now I will give you the actual instructions.”
353
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Adding Humor to Training

 If a participant answers a question incorrectly, you could say, “right
answer, wrong question!” (Be careful with this one.)
 If the lights go out, you can say, “Why do I have the feeling that when the
lights come back on, I’ll be alone?” or “You thought you were in the dark
before this session!”
Humor can turn an awkward situation into an enjoyable experience. The par-
ticipants laugh. The laughter makes them feel good and eases the tension of a
difficult situation for the trainer.
Get Participants in the Act 
Don’t feel as if you need to be the one responsible for all the laughs. Get par-
ticipants in the act so all enjoy themselves. How can you do that? 
Many games and energizers exist where everyone is laughing at the end. Relay
races can have that effect on participants. “All Tied Up” is an energizer in
which participants stand in close proximity to one another. Everyone grasps
everyone else’s hand in no particular order. Next, participants begin to untan-
gle themselves. 
One game that results in everyone laughing is called “Did You Shower Today?”
Place one chair for each participant in a circle. Have all participants sit in the
chairs. Begin giving directions for participants to change chairs. I have started
you off with a few, but you can add or change them to personalize for your
group. This activity helps participants get to know each other better and
leaves them laughing because at times four of five people may be trying to sit
on the same chair. 
 If you showered today, move 3 chairs to the left.
 If you read a newspaper regularly, move 2 chairs to the right.
 If you traveled abroad within the past year, move 1 chair to the right.
 If you like chocolate, move 2 chairs to the left.
 If you have a pet, move 3 chairs to the right.
 If you like snow and winter weather, move 1 chair to the right.
 If you are a gourmet cook, move 2 chairs to the left.
 If you like to paint, move 3 chairs to the left.
 If you play a sport, move 1 chair to the right.
354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 If you are involved in a sport that does not require a ball, move 1 chair
to the left.
 If you like Mexican food, move 5 chairs to the left.
 . . . add your own ideas.
When participants say something funny, be sure that the entire group has
heard it so everyone feels a part of the humor. 
Practical Humor
Sometimes trainers facilitate energizers that are unrelated to the content or
the process. You can do this, but with time often short, think of ways to ener-
gize the participants yet make it useful. Humor can be practical, such as
when you are forming small groups or designating a leader for a small group.
Here are two suggestions for designating a leader. Both get laughs. The first is
to ask for someone to volunteer from each group. Tell them that you cannot
say what they are volunteering for until after they volunteer. This always gets
a laugh. After you get a volunteer from each group, tell them that they can
select the leader for the group. That usually brings on lots of groans.
I learned the second method for selecting a leader from Bob Pike. Have each
small group stand in a circle. Ask all participants to point their index fingers
to the ceiling and to think of whom they can select as their group’s leader.
Then tell them that on the count of three they should all point to the person
for whom they are voting. Each group counts the number of “votes” each
person received. The person with the most votes is the leader.
Add humor when you are forming small groups. One way I have done this is
to place table tents around the room that have funny activities printed on
them. Participants are asked to stand next to the card that describes some-
thing that they do. Items can include these or others you identify.
 Has eaten an entire batch of cookies
 Has gone skinny-dipping
 Squeezes toothpaste from the middle
Don’t Be Original!
All of your humor does not need to be original. In fact, it may be better if
someone else has tested it for you.

Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Adding Humor to Training

The HUMOR Project, Inc. in Saratoga Springs, New York, is a great place to
start. It is the first organization in the world to focus full-time on the positive
power of humor. Its mission is to “make a difference by being a unique, pio-
neering, and cutting-edge organization that touches the lives of individuals,
organizations, and nations.” The organization wants people to get more
“smileage” out of their lives by applying the practical, positive power of
humor and creativity. Check its Web site at www.HUMORproject.com for pub-
lications including books, Laughing Matters Magazine, and an e-newsletter.
The organization holds an annual conference in Saratoga Springs, where they
are located. You will also find props that can add humor to your training. The
least you should do is to get on their mailing list, and they will send you a
fabulous catalog.
Many books are available for finding anecdotes or stories to make your point.
One of my favorites is Braude’s Treasury of Wit and Humor for All Occasions,
published by Prentice Hall. And, of course, you should ever be on the lookout
for cartoons (remember to obtain permission if you intend to print them in
your materials) and jokes that will fit in your content.
The Sunday comic strips are often closer to real life than you may imagine. If
it is a simple concept, you may be able to describe the cartoon without the
image. Tear jokes, cartoons, and advertising out of magazines and start a file
of content. Join a daily joke list on the Internet. 
Get ideas by reading or listening to current and classic comedians. Several
of the classic comedians whom I enjoy are Mae West, Groucho Marx, Henny
Youngman, Jack Benny, and W.C. Fields, who said, “Comedy is a serious busi-
ness. A serious business with only one purpose — to make people laugh.”
Referencing something that most participants will remember can add humor.
For example, sometimes television ads will make a point that you can use.
You may not need to say anything much more than referring to the ad, such
as, “Remember the X company ad where they were herding cats?” You can
also reference lines in movies that make a point and add humor. You can
state the movie, the actor’s name, and the punch line to get a laugh.
Remember who is in your audience. Don’t do as I did once, referencing a
movie that was over 30 years old. Because most of the participants in my
training session were in their late 20s and early 30s, none had seen the movie!
Phunny Props and Puns
Add fun with props. Sometimes a prop can represent a concept within your
training session. For example, I use a flashlight when I teach creativity skills in
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

a variety of ways to add fun to the session. I refer to the fact that their “creativ-
ity may be in the dark” but there are ways to “ignite their spark.” I challenge
them to “harness their creative energy” and state that there is a “ray of hope.” I
tell them that the session will “illuminate” their natural creativity.
Notice the use of puns in the creativity example. You can’t just add props with-
out making a point. For example, I once saw someone use a rubber chicken to
point to content on the flipchart. There was no purpose, except to make people
laugh. He was successful. People laughed. Maybe I’m too uptight, but I just did
not think it was funny. There are many other ways you can make people laugh
that relates to the training content.
Props may be used to review content material and increase energy. Many
trainers have participants get in a circle and toss a tennis ball or a koosh ball
as they review material. In addition to relating to content, props can be used
as prizes during the session after games or activities or as rewards when
someone volunteers to be a leader or observer or to play another role that
goes above and beyond expectations.
Other props that will make people smile may be related to an upcoming holi-
day. Sparklers for the Fourth of July or candy hearts for Valentine’s Day will
make people smile without your saying anything. You can go beyond the tra-
ditional holidays by using props related to Mardi Gras, the Super Bowl,
Groundhog Day, May Day, the first day of spring, and so on.
Another logical prop is anything that has a yellow smiley face on it. Smiley
faces have become quite common place, so items displaying them are easy
to locate. They do make people smile. Whatever you use, try to tie it to the
topic, the area, or your audience. Use puns to stretch the meaning a bit.
Ten Tips to Make a Joke Bomb
How many trainers does it take to make a joke bomb? Just one. But once is
enough! Telling a joke is easy. Making people laugh is hard work. Professional
comedians make it look oh so easy. But the truth is that few have ever ad-
libbed a line in their life. They practice and prepare — just like great trainers
do. If you are going to tell a joke, heed the following ten things that can go
wrong. If you want your participants to laugh, don’t do them!
 Announce that you are going to tell a joke.
 Don’t practice; rely on your natural skills and your ability to ad-lib.
 Ensure that the joke has nothing to do with the content.
357
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Adding Humor to Training

 Insult someone or, better yet, everyone.
 Use a sexist, ethnic, political, racist, or religious joke.
 Extend the joke, making it drag out.
 Garble the punch line.
 Don’t research your audience; everyone loves a joke.
 Laugh your way through the joke.
 If your joke bombs, be sure to try to explain the punch line.
Here’s to having only good belly laughs following all your jokes.
But I’m Not Funny!
When I first started in the training field, a friend of mine gave me advice
about using humor. He said, “Don’t try to be funny; just have fun.” I know I
don’t need to be a comedian to be seen as having a great sense of humor.
Don’t take yourself too seriously. You need to be able to laugh at yourself to
be seen as someone who has a sense of humor. Mess up in front of the class?
Make a joke and write it off as an opportunity to add humor to the session.
Focus on the participants. When you care more about the participants and
the experience you are creating for them than you care about yourself, it
frees you of a huge responsibility. You do not need to be perfect. Things will
go wrong in your training session. Participants will not behave the way you
want them to; the room will not be set up as you wanted it to be. There’s not
much you can do about anything that goes wrong, but you can have fun with
it while you are fixing the problem. Find humor in the unpredictable.
Identify the humor that is natural to you. I can’t spell worth a darn; I make a
joke about it. I am 4'11" short; I make a joke about it. I’ve been in the training
field for a quarter of a century; I make a joke about it. I am not a computer
whiz; I make a joke about it. What’s funny about you?
Learners are desperate for humor, but it is virtually absent in the learning
environment. I have found that learners will appreciate any attempt at humor.
Participants often walk into a training session expecting a boring experience.
I know because they have told me so. If you can surprise them by removing
most of the boredom, you will be a star. Remember, you do not have to be
funny, just have fun.
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Austere Attitudes
Everyone who walks into your training session will not be interested in being
humored. Some will bring attitudes that are barriers to having a good time. 
 Training is serious business — just like work.
 Humor is a waste of time.
 Employees who have fun at work are not productive.
 We can’t possibly accomplish our goals with all this raucous laughter.
What can you do to try to turn these attitudes around? Well, nothing new:
Build trust, encourage participation, respect others’ opinions, and ensure
that participants take responsibility for their own learning. When using
humor, it should flow naturally from the content. Humor should support, not
replace, the learning objectives. Always have alternatives to humorous activi-
ties available if the humor isn’t right for a particular group of participants.

Ten Icebreakers That Work
In This Chapter
 Getting practical advice for selecting and conducting icebreakers
 Reviewing ten classic icebreakers that work
 Identifying criteria for measuring the effectiveness of an icebreaker
T
he room is set. Participant materials are in place. The projector with your
PowerPoint presentation is focused, and the participants have arrived.
It’s time to begin your training session, and first impressions will set the
stage for the rest of the time together.
Chapter 18 introduces you to a number of elements that should be included
in your opening. One of those is to help everyone get to know each other
better. That is the key purpose of icebreakers. 
I am convinced that training sessions are better when they start out with an
icebreaker. Whether you use icebreakers created by someone else or you
design your own, I suggest that you pay attention to some advice based on
lessons I learned the hard way.
 Never ask anyone to do anything you would not want to do. This is
cardinal rule number one. Isn’t it amazing that participants will almost
always follow a trainer’s direction and do what they are asked to do?
They believe that trainers always know what they’re doing and that the
things a trainer asks them to do will further their learning. If you hesitate
for even a moment about conducting a particular icebreaker, don’t use
it. Your hesitation is a sign that it may not feel good to other participants
as well. Participants trust trainers and trust that what we ask them to do
is in their best interest. Don’t break that trust.
I was once a participant in a training session in which the trainer asked
us to get down on our hands and knees, make animal sounds, and find
others who were imitating the same animals. As I was on the floor growl-
ing like a lion, I spotted the trainer laughing away. I felt duped and had
much less respect for that trainer from that point on. Lesson learned?
Be careful what you ask participants to do; it should maintain their self-
esteem, build trust, and enhance what they are learning.

 Select icebreakers based on the type of group you’re training. The par-
ticipants who attend your training should help guide your decision.
Executives will respond differently than factory employees, and employ-
ees in sales will react differently than those in engineering. Ask yourself
a few questions about the participants to assist with your choice.
At what level are they in the organization? What jobs do they have?
What is their cultural background? What is the age range? What gender?
What educational level are they? What expectations will the participants
have? What past training experiences have they had? Early in my career
I did not take the time to ask these questions. I was asked to provide
communications training to a group of engineers. Although I customized
the training for the engineers, I used the same icebreaker that I had
developed for a communication module for a sales staff. It fell flat. The
analytical engineers were the exact opposites from the gregarious sales
folks. Lesson learned? Know your audience.
 Relate the icebreaker to the content. I have always believed that ice-
breakers should relate to content so that they serve as the introduction
to the topic. Today there is a more practical reason for relating the ice-
breaker to the content: time. In almost all organizations there seems to
be more to do with less time to do it. Participants are busy, and it is a
good possibility that the organization has asked trainers to squeeze
more content into shorter sessions. 
This means that it is wise to make every minute of your training session
count. For example, if you’re conducting a diversity session, select an ice-
breaker that spotlights differences. If you’re conducting a team-building
session, select an icebreaker that addresses individual team skills or
characteristics. When I relate the icebreaker to the content, the flow of
the session is natural. However, when I don’t, I create a problem for
myself because I must force a connection. Lesson learned? Make every
minute in your training sessions count, starting immediately with a
related icebreaker.
 Use icebreakers to set the tone and to demonstrate the level of partici-
pation you expect. The icebreaker can set the stage for how much
involvement you expect of the participants. If you want them to interact
with each other, you can select an icebreaker that gets them out of their
seats and moving around meeting as many people as they can. In fact,
the number of people participants meet during the icebreaker can be a
part of the challenge. If you want participants to work in teams, you may
design an icebreaker that encourages teamwork. 
I remember using an icebreaker that was so funny it was difficult for any
of us to stop laughing. Unfortunately, the topic was a serious one, and it
was a challenge to make the switch for both me and the participants.
Lesson learned? Select an icebreaker that sets the tone for the environ-
ment you’re trying to create.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Observe the group during the icebreaker to learn something about
the group and the individuals. Icebreakers provide trainers with a per-
fect opportunity to learn about the group as well as individuals. In some
cases the group will be outgoing and fun loving. In other cases the group
may be defensive and negative. Trainers can observe individuals in the
group to determine who seem to be the natural leaders, who has a ten-
dency to dominate, or who is competitive.
At times I have gotten so involved in the icebreaker that I did not take
advantage of this opportunity to learn more about the participants in the
session. Later when I have had a problem behavior in the training session,
I question whether I would have been able to head off the problem earlier
if I had given more attention to the right things during the icebreaker.
Lesson learned? Attend to the personalities during the icebreaker — the
individual participant personalities, as well as the group’s personality.
 Watch the time during an icebreaker. You will have determined how
much time you will spend conducting an icebreaker. However, if you
have selected an energizing icebreaker, it is easy for time to get away
from you in a couple different ways. 
First, if you have individual report outs (as some of the icebreakers in
this chapter call for), set a limit on the amount of time allowed for each.
If a participant takes too much time, intervene tactfully to get the group
back on track. If you have 20 participants and each report-out takes just
2 minutes more than you planned, you will be 40 minutes behind sched-
ule before you have even completed the introduction! Individual report-
outs in groups over 25 become tedious and boring. Try another format,
for example, individual introductions, but reports by small group. Or
you could have the individual report-outs occur in subgroups.
Just recently I had a time problem in a group of 18 in a training certifi-
cate program. The final step of the icebreaker involved participants
introducing themselves: name, city they lived in, how long in the job,
and the slogan that defined them. The first person stood and provided
at least 25 percent of his life story. I did not (though I knew I should
have) cut him off. His one-minute introduction lasted at least five min-
utes. Unfortunately, everyone else in the group expanded their introduc-
tion to be in line with the first person. At the end of the icebreaker, we
were almost an hour behind schedule. Lesson learned? Time can evapo-
rate during an icebreaker. Watch your time carefully.
Remember, an icebreaker’s success depends on the trainer in two ways:
ensuring that you have established a comfortable climate and that you have
selected the right icebreaker. You must be able to quickly establish a climate
that gives participants permission to step outside their comfort zone. When
you announce that time has been set aside for participants to meet each
other, you may look about and see some rolled eyes or hear some groans.
363
Chapter 23: Ten Icebreakers That Work

That means that a couple of participants would rather sit in their chairs than
go out to meet others. Use a tone right from the start to establish a climate
that ensures people feel comfortable: a pleasant voice, a friendly smile, wel-
coming gestures, appropriate eye contact, and short, clear instructions all
tell your participants that it is okay to play.
Finally, heed my advice throughout this chapter. It is based on the lessons I’ve
learned over the years. Ask yourself these questions about the icebreaker you
intend to use. Did you select one that is appropriate for the participants? Does
the icebreaker allow you to establish a climate that gives participants permis-
sion to follow your lead? Have you simplified the directions so that everyone
will experience success? If you can answer yes to all of these questions, your
icebreaker will achieve the objectives you desire.
Good luck with your icebreakers. May they warm your training sessions
immeasurably. 
Avoid using the word “icebreaker” when introducing the exercise. Even
though that’s what it is, remember that the word itself is trainer jargon that
may not be understood by everyone. Even more important, however, is that
you will appear more professional if you smoothly introduce what you want
participants to do and why you want them to do it without labeling it as an
icebreaker, an exercise, an activity, or any other “thing” you want them to do.
You can say something like, “During the training session, we will be working
together and tapping into the expertise in this room. Therefore, it is important
that we find out who else is here and what experiences they bring with them.”
Bingo
Bingo is probably the most used icebreaker of all the icebreakers. And the
reason is, that it works. It has been around forever, and I do not know where
it originated. Reproduce a Bingo card on a sheet of paper. Instead of having B-
3 or N-13, each square has information. The information can be so specific
that it matches individuals in the group, such as “drives a red Corvette” and
“played a saxophone with Kenny G.” The information can also be general so
that it could match any number of people, such as “likes to drive fast” and
“plays a musical instrument.” Figure 23-1 provides an example of a Bingo
card. 
Participants move around the room and find a match to each of the criteria. In
the first example, they would be looking for a specific person. In the second,
several people may match the criteria. Individuals sign the appropriate square
that matches their descriptions. It is a great way to meet and greet and learn
something about others in the session to encourage additional discussion at
the next break.
364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You can easily tie these questions to the content, if you want. For example, if
you’re conducting a stress-management class, you could include squares that
say “attends yoga classes,” “goes for a walk at lunch,” or “has used visualiza-
tion successfully.” 
Expectations
If Bingo is the most used icebreaker, Expectations may very well run a close
second. I learned this one from Ed Scannell and John Newstrom, authors of
the wildly successful, very useful, and creative Games Trainers Play series.
Buy any of them; you won’t be disappointed.

Chapter 23: Ten Icebreakers That Work

In Expectations, participants identify what they really want to learn in the
training session to make the day (workshop, training, week) valuable and
useful to them. After you tell them what the objectives are for the session,
have them form groups of two to four. Give the groups five minutes to list two
or three expectations on a sheet of paper. As a trainer, you’re trying to tap
into their initial thoughts. If you allow more than five minutes, they will begin
to go beyond the scope of the training. Also as a trainer you need to be pre-
pared to adjust your training session to accommodate those that you can.
You may be surprised that most of the participants’ expectations will be cov-
ered.
Hopes and Fears
The Expectations icebreaker taps into the cerebral desires that the partici-
pants bring with them to the training session. Hopes and Fears taps into the
participants’ feelings about the training.
Provide a handout to participants that provides space for them to list their
hopes and fears as they relate to the training session. Tell them that when-
ever people find themselves in a new situation, it is natural to begin thinking
about the things they hope will happen and the things they hope will not
happen. This exercise is an opportunity to find out how similar everyone is.
Allow about three to four minutes for them to complete the handout. 
Have participants pair up with someone they do not know or do not know
well to discuss their lists. Conduct a round robin, obtaining one item from
each column from the pairs. You may want to post them on a flipchart.
Discuss the items, informing them of the hopes that will occur or what you
may be able to do about those hopes that are not planned into the session.
Also, reassure them of the fears that are unfounded or quell fears that are not
really going to be as bad as they anticipate. For example, if participants in a
speaking class will be videotaped and that is a fear that arises, you can dis-
cuss the benefits of the videotaping and let them know that no one will watch
it except them (if that is true).
Post the flipchart pages on the walls during the first break.
Introduce Me, I Introduce You
It is sometimes easier to introduce others than it is to introduce yourself. In
this icebreaker, pair participants up and have each interview the other to
learn enough about the person to introduce him or her to the larger group.
You may want to suggest the information you would like them to obtain, for
example, their names, how long they have worked for the organization, where
they attended school, something interesting about them that may be just a
366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

little different than anyone else in the room, or what they are hoping to
improve as a result of this training session. 
Provide paper for participants to conduct their interviews. After five to ten
minutes for the interviews, have participants begin to introduce each other.
In an exercise like this, I generally ask for a volunteer to go first as opposed
to assigning someone to start. Some people prefer to have a model.
Go to Your Corners
This is another icebreaker that has been around a long time. It is used for dis-
covering participants’ common interests. Place four flipcharts in the four cor-
ners of the room. On the first page of each, write one of four words or
phrases. They should be topics that would generate curiosity and/or tap into
the interests of the group. You may use travel, reading, running, and gourmet
cooking. Ask participants to choose one. After they select a corner, have
them discuss why they chose that corner. 
Have someone turn the first page on each chart to reveal the second round.
These four pages could include something around the current events of the
day. Again, have participants read the charts and select a new corner. Repeat
the process.
I generally have the third and fourth pages relate to the content of the ses-
sion. The third round may focus on needs the participants have and can be
stated as “I hope we learn to . . .” followed by four things participants may
want to learn. Conduct a short debriefing, asking someone in the group to
summarize why they made that choice.
The fourth round can again relate to the content. You may use “I feel good
about . . .” or I think I am pretty good at. . . .” These show the rest of the par-
ticipants where the experts are in the group.
This icebreaker can also be used as an energizer if the pace bogs down, such
as after lunch in a warm training room. When used as an energizer, identify
content items that they can review in the four small groups.
Little White Lie
Allow participants a couple of minutes to think about this before putting
them into groups of three. In the small groups, each person makes three state-
ments about themselves: Two are truthful, and one is a lie. For example, my
statement may be: I love to drive on icy roads; my hobby is gardening; and I
think sleep is a waste of time and do not sleep at least one night each week.
367
Chapter 23: Ten Icebreakers That Work

The other two individuals guess which one is the lie. After a few minutes, the
trios introduce themselves, playing off what happened in the activity.
I use this icebreaker to introduce a communication-styles workshop. The
relationship is that if you know something about people’s styles, you will be
able to tell something about their preferences.
Personal Coat of Arms
Creating a coat of arms is an icebreaker that is a true classic. Although it has
been around for many years, it is just as effective as the first time it was used.
Creating a Personal Coat of Arms is more serious than most other icebreakers.
In it, the trainer asks participants to draw a coat of arms that represents who
they are. Participants may want to use words or draw symbols or pictures. 
You may want to distribute a shield-like sketch that is divided into four quad-
rants. Have participants address a different item in each of the four quad-
rants. For example, participants may identify themselves on their coat of
arms by answering who they are at work, at home, at play, and in the future.
The coat of arms could also display something about what they like to do
at work, at home, at play, in the community. You may request four specific
aspects, or you may ask for something more generic: “Draw a coat of arms
that tells us who you are.”
In this icebreaker, it is a good idea to draw your own coat of arms and display
and explain it to the group. I may share a coat of arms that looks something
like the one in Figure 23-2. I would tell participants that I am a positive person
who loves to write. I live on the water and am learning to play tennis.
Figure 23-2:
A coat-of-
arms
example.
368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You can do many things with this icebreaker, including relating it to the content
or focusing all of the quadrants in the future instead of the present and/or the
past. 
Autographs
Autographs is one of the most practical icebreakers. It is straightforward
and serves as a perfect bridge from introductions to content. You can easily
design your own Autographs to match the content in the training program
you’re designing. I first heard of this icebreaker from Michele Wyman, a col-
league and trainer. The goal of this icebreaker is for each participant to meet
many participants by obtaining as many autographs as possible.
To customize Autographs for your use, create a handout that lists 15 to 25
questions or statements that can be “autographed” by participants who
match the description. Provide a combination of personal statements and
content-related statements. Personal statements may include “Has been to
Europe,” or “Has performed on stage.” Content-related statements will match
the training topic. A communications training session may include state-
ments such as “Have been told I am a good listener” or “Spends at least 50
percent of on-the-job time communicating.”
After brief hello-my-name-is introductions, distribute the handout that you cre-
ated. Tell participants that they will walk around and meet others in the ses-
sion. When they meet a participant who matches one of the descriptions, he
or she will sign the sheet. To encourage participants to meet as many people
as possible, they must have a different autograph after each statement.
Name Association
Name Association has the unique quality of using a method to help partici-
pants remember each others’ names. This may be one of the oldest icebreakers
ever developed. I remember playing a game similar to Name Association —
and that was before icebreakers were even invented! Two alternatives are pre-
sented here. 
The first is to have participants introduce themselves using a characteristic
that helps to identify them. The characteristic could rhyme with the partici-
pant’s name, such as Duane the Brain or Tall Paul. The characteristic could
start with the same letter as the person’s name, such as Happy Harry or
Timely Terry.
369
Chapter 23: Ten Icebreakers That Work

The second association can be related to an imaginary event. Participants
introduce themselves and identify something they will contribute to the
event that rhymes with their names. For example, if the event is a party, par-
ticipants may introduce themselves like this: 
 “My name is Ned, and I’ll bring the bread.”
 “My name is Mark, and I’ll ensure a spark.”
 “My name is Linda, and I’ll bring the Splenda.”
 “My name is Maggie, and I’ll bring the baggies.”
Note that the names do not need to rhyme perfectly and the items don’t
even need to make much sense. The real reason for using a name association
icebreaker is to help participants remember the names of the others in the
session.
Ask a Question
There may be times when you’re looking for something quick and easy.
Perhaps you do not have much time up front, but you still want everyone to
know something about each other. If the session is only a couple of hours
long, you have only a few minutes for an icebreaker. And if you plan for inter-
action among participants, you may actually save time by conducting a quick
icebreaker up front that allows participants to meet each other. 
There may be other times when your participants all work together and know
each other, and you may want to get them to a similar level of knowledge or
take them to a personal level of knowing each other. In these situations you
may decide to ask a question of participants. Again, remember you can use
this technique and relate it to the content as described in the introduction to
this chapter. However, if you’re simply looking for a question to ensure that
everyone knows something new about the rest of the participants, these
questions have worked well for me over the years.
 What do you like to do for fun?
 If you could be any animal, what would it be and why?
 Can you describe your dream vacation?
 What do you like best about where you live?
 What would you do if you suddenly became a multimillionaire by win-
ning the lottery?
 What was the last book you read, and would you recommend it to the
rest of us?
370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 If you could have a party and invite any three people of your choosing,
alive or deceased, who would you invite?
 What historical person could teach you something, and what would they
teach you?
 How do you like to spend your Saturdays?
 If you could change the world, what would you do?
 What do you believe was the turning point in your life?
 What opportunity did you miss, and how would it have changed your
life today?
 What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?
 Whom do you most admire, and why?
 What’s the most unusual thing that has ever happened to you?
 How do you like to celebrate success?
 What do you have in your billfold, pocket, or purse that none of us
would expect to find there and why?
 If you were wearing a T-shirt that displayed your life slogan, what would
the words on the T-shirt say?
 What is one interesting fact about you that most of the group would not
know?
 What is your all-time favorite movie and why?
This is just a small sample of the questions you could use. Perhaps this list
will start you thinking of others. (I try to tie even these questions to the con-
tent, if at all possible.) These questions can be used at other times during a
training session. For example, if you need a quick energizer right after lunch,
try one of these.
Which icebreaker to use? The decision is up to you. Consider the time you
have available, who’s in your audience, the content of the training, what you
want to accomplish, the location where the training will occur, and what you
feel comfortable doing.
What should you accomplish with an icebreaker? There are many things to
consider, but I try to accomplish the following as a minimum.
 Grab participants’ attention
 Establish a participative climate in which everyone is involved
 Set the pace for the rest of the training session
 Put people at ease, and this includes me, the trainer
371
Chapter 23: Ten Icebreakers That Work

 Initiate personal interaction between the participants
 Complete introductions of all participants that go beyond just their
names and where they work
 Ensure that everyone speaks at least once in the large group
 Observe the group to define its personality 
 Identify the individual personalities in the group
 Share enough information so that everyone learns something about the
other participants
 Establish a starting point for or a transition to the content
Create your own list of what you want to accomplish with the icebreakers
you conduct.
