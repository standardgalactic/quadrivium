About the Author
Mary White is the President and Founder of www.BnBFinder.com, a leading 
bed & breakfast directory.
In 1998, after many years as a securities broker, Mary decided to embark on 
a new venture — Internet publishing. With a Bachelor of Arts and a Master 
of Business Administration, she developed a simple business model: offer-
ing consumers exciting, innovative ways to access practical information in 
easy-to-use formats. She decided to test this concept in a field she believed 
in, the bed & breakfast industry. Mary’s mission was to provide an easy-to-
use Web site that could effectively put B&Bs and inns on a level playing field 
with larger hotels and resorts, convey the uniqueness and special features 
of B&Bs, and provide consumers with the information they need in order to 
choose a B&B. Today her site, www.BnBFinder.com, consistently earns the 
industry’s highest ratings by providing interesting content and comprehen-
sive search features while incorporating the latest technology for both the 
novice and experienced Web user.
Mary enjoys every aspect of working with new and seasoned innkeepers and 
has helped thousands of innkeepers to market their inns. She does numer-
ous radio and podcast interviews each year, is a frequent contributor to 
major newspapers and magazines, and has presented workshops at several 
Professional Association of Innkeepers International conferences.
Mary lives in New York City with her husband, Greg, and is the proud mother 
of two exceptional teenagers.
For more information on B&Bs, feel free to contact Mary at www.BnBFinder.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the thousands of wonderful innkeepers I’ve worked 
with over the years who have created places where guests can wake up 
someplace special. It’s a privilege and true pleasure to work with you and to 
promote your inns on BnBFinder.com.
And, of course, to my wonderful family and special friends who have helped 
and supported me without hesitation. To Greg, Steven, and Kristin, you guys 
are the best part of my life; to Joe, who helped me to create BnBFinder.com 
and who is always there when I need him; to Loretta, Patti, Steve, Ed, Daria, 
Gabe, Erika, Jane, and Lorraine; and because I am so blessed, there are too 
many others of you to name individually. You know who you are and how 
much I love and appreciate you, especially my parents who taught me that a 
mom can work hard, run her own business, and be a good mom.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I, and everyone who reads this book, owe a huge debt of gratitude to five 
very special and dedicated innkeepers and inn consultants who generously 
shared their time, experience, and expertise to guide me in assembling the 
valuable resource that I know this book will be for aspiring innkeepers. Thank 
you Diane and Michele DiNapoli, Innkeepers at Journey Inn (www.journey
inn.com) in Hyde Park, New York; Dottie Musser, Innkeeper at Bradford 
Place Inn and Gardens (www.bradfordplaceinn.com) in Sonora, California; 
Linda Hayes, Innkeeper at Inn at Riverbend (www.innatriverbend.com) in 
Pearisburg, Virginia; Hilary Jones, Innkeeper at Admiral Peary House (www.
admiralpearyhouse.com) in Fryeburg, Maine, and professional inn consul-
tant (www.inngenium.com) specializing in strategic and business planning 
for the small lodging industry; and Hugh Daniels, professional inn consultant 
(www.askhugh.com) and a retired 22-year innkeeper with an MBA and a 
head for numbers. When you assemble a good team, great things happen; 
each of you — and your sometimes diverse views — made this a fabulous 
team that I can’t thank you enough for being a part of.
Thank you also to those of you who have shared with me the vision of 
BnBFinder.com and devoted your efforts to making it a great resource for 
innkeepers and travelers.
Finally, thank you to my technical editor, Diane Callahan, and to Mike Lewis, 
Alissa Schwipps, Christy Pingleton, Elizabeth Rea, and everyone else in the 
Wiley organization who knew and appreciated the need for a comprehensive 
resource such as this book for aspiring innkeepers.

Introduction
R
unning a bed & breakfast is a dream that many inn guests take away 
from their B&B getaways, and I’m thrilled that you’re exploring this 
vision. If you’re like many, you’ve been thinking about it for years, you’ve 
been cutting out recipes, and you can envision your ideal inn with you as the 
innkeeper. Some of your friends think you’re crazy and others think you’ll be 
a natural. This book is your guide to getting started, being prepared, and run-
ning a successful bed & breakfast.
To be an innkeeper and run a profitable bed & breakfast, you need to see 
past the idyllic notions of innkeeping and be ready for the tough choices and 
sacrifices that you’ll make as an innkeeper; and this book addresses them

About This Book
No book can tell you exactly how to run a bed & breakfast because no two 
bed & breakfasts are alike. Every area has different restrictions, requirements, 
and appeal, and innkeepers add their own personalities to their inns. What this 
book does is tell you what you need to know, what you should consider, and 
where to turn for answers to any questions that are unique to your situation.
Each chapter is divided into sections, and each section contains information 
to help you run a successful bed & breakfast, including:
 
✓ How to get started, what to look for in a location, and how to make an 
offer to purchase your inn
 
✓ The biggest problems new bed & breakfasts encounter and how to avoid 
them
 
✓ What you need to know about taking reservations and using property 
management software

Running a Bed & Breakfast For Dummies 
 
✓ How to market your bed & breakfast, including creating a Web site, get-
ting your inn listed on the search engines, and navigating the confusing 
advertising choices that you’ll be confronted with so you know what 
works and how to spend your advertising dollars wisely
 
✓ How to get extra help when you need it
 
✓ The best ways to furnish your inn
 
✓ Ways to save time cleaning and preparing breakfast
The best part about this book is that you decide where to start and what to 
read. It’s a reference, so if you forget something or want to review it again, 
you can easily refer back to that section. Let the table of contents and the 
index be your guides.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
✓ New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by easy-to-understand 
definitions.
 
✓ Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps and key-
words in bulleted lists.
In the bed & breakfast industry, the terms bed & breakfast, bed & breakfast 
inn, B&B, and inn are used interchangeably. Throughout this book I have 
incorporated this same terminology.
What You’re Not to Read
I’ve written this book so that you can find the most important information 
quickly and easily and also skip over some of the finer details. While I’d love 
for you to read every word, I’ve set some text off from the main information, 
text you can live without if you’re just after the reference material. Don’t 
get me wrong — this stuff is interesting material, and I think you may find it 
helpful. But if you’re just after the nuts and bolts, you can come back to the 
text in sidebars later. Sidebars are shaded boxes that usually give detailed 
examples or flesh out historical perspectives on the topic at hand.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
As an innkeeper you’re going to have to make some assumptions about your 
guests, and in writing this book I’ve made some assumptions about you and 
why you’re reading this book:
 
✓ You love staying at bed & breakfasts and you’ve dreamed for a long time 
about owning your own inn.
 
✓ You’re an excellent host or hostess looking for a new career, and friends 
have told you that you should open a bed & breakfast.
 
✓ You’ve found a beautiful old home and you’re trying to figure out how 
you can afford it so you’re exploring the possibility of turning it into a 
bed & breakfast.
 
✓ You want to get away from the corporate world, be your own boss, and 
unleash your creativity.
 
✓ You’re already an innkeeper and you’re looking for tips and advice to 
make your business more profitable and successful.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six parts, each an ingredient in the recipe for run-
ning a successful bed & breakfast inn.
Part I: Inn the Beginning
In this part, I get you ready to enter the bed & breakfast industry. I outline 
the basics for you so you have an overview of what a bed & breakfast is and 
what some of your marketing obstacles may be. I also give you the informa-
tion to analyze the social skills and the commitment necessary to be a suc-
cessful innkeeper, and help you to pick a location and size for your B&B.
Part II: Transitioning from 
Inn Goer to Inn Owner
In this part, I help you get started by giving you ideas to create a plan for 
your business. I suggest important steps you can take on your own and when 

4
Running a Bed & Breakfast For Dummies 
you should engage outside professionals. This section also covers the impor-
tant information you need to know when you’re buying an existing bed & 
breakfast — from making an offer to closing the sale — as well as information 
you need if you’re building a new inn from the ground up or converting an 
existing property or your home into a B&B.
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests
In this part, I get you ready to greet guests. First I help you to get organized 
by setting up your records. This section gives you the information you need 
to set up your books as well as choose a property management system, set 
your rates, and establish your policies. Then I help you get a basic marketing 
plan in place so that guests will find you, and I include important information 
that you must know when designing or updating your Web site. I won’t have 
you ready to welcome guests until I help you furnish your inn and create a 
plan for your all-important breakfasts, so I also share some of my favorite 
tried-and-tested sample menus and recipes.
Part IV: Up and Running: 
Day-to-Day Operations
In this part, I guide you through taking reservations. This may be when 
guests get their first impression of your inn, so you want to do it right. I help 
you take care of guests, including checking them in and getting them settled, 
and, for those rare occasions when you have problem guests, I give you some 
suggestions on how to handle them. We all know cleaning isn’t fun, but keep-
ing a clean inn is an important part of your business, so I share some tips 
and tricks to help you get this job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
You’re taking on a big job as an innkeeper, so I give you advice on how to get 
extra help when you need it — including how to take a vacation.
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast 
and the Basics
In this part, I make sure you don’t feel left on your own just because you’ve 
made it to the point of opening and running a bed & breakfast. I help you ana-
lyze your results and make future projections. For those of you whose goal is 
to build your business further, I provide concrete marketing advice tailored

Running a Bed & Breakfast For Dummies 
If you’re not sure where you want to start, begin with Part I. It gives you all 
the basic info you need to understand what it takes to be a successful inn-
keeper. It also points to places where you can find more detailed informa-
tion in this book and in the B&B industry, including the support of other 
innkeepers.

Part I
Inn the Beginning

In this part . . .
You take a look at what a B&B really is and get an 
overview of the bed & breakfast industry to help you 
to decide if running a place of your own is right for you. I 
help you determine if you have what it takes to be a suc-
cessful innkeeper. I also break down the process of pick-
ing the right location, which is a key factor in the success 
of your business, and help you figure out what size and 
what type of bed & breakfast to open.

Chapter 1
So You Want to Open a B&B
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what a bed & breakfast is and isn’t
▶ Surveying the skills and personality traits being an innkeeper requires
▶ Looking at the pros and cons of being an innkeeper
▶ Filling in the gaps: Ways to find out more of what you want to know
You’ve been cutting out recipes for years, everyone tells you you’re the 
perfect host or hostess, and you’ve stayed at more B&Bs than you can 
count — but will you be a good innkeeper? Maybe. The fact that you can cook 
doesn’t mean you have the persistence and stamina to run an inn, nor does 
being handy at restoring an old building mean you have the leadership skills 
it takes to run a business.
Some equate the job of an innkeeper to that of an actor or actress in that you 
must be “on” whenever you’re working. The differences are that you can’t be 
acting, and the show never ends. When you’re an innkeeper, it’s show time 24 
hours a day.
In this chapter, I give you a clear vision of what a B&B is (and isn’t) and what 
being an innkeeper entails — without rose-colored glasses. Parts of this chap-
ter may sound discouraging, but they’re not meant to dishearten you. Rather, 
the intention is to make sure you enter the world of innkeeping with your 
eyes wide open, the skills you need to succeed, and the support you need to 
thrive. I want you to be sure that you have what it takes not only to run a suc-
cessful inn but also to be happy in your new profession.
Defining B&B: It’s Not Just 
a Bed and a Breakfast
A bed & breakfast is more than the simple combination of a bed and a break-
fast. It’s a business and a unique lodging experience for your guests. You 
can be the best host or hostess in the world, but if you don’t run your B&B 

10
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
as a business, you run the risk of not being able to pay your bills. Equally as 
important, you must see your customers as guests. If you run a rigid business 
without providing warmth and hospitality, you miss out on the joys and satis-
faction of innkeeping, and your guests leave your inn deprived of the special 
B&B lodging experience.
The next sections clarify exactly what constitutes a B&B, and point out some 
fallacies you may encounter among those who are less enlightened.
Clearing up confusion: What a B&B is
You may be a bit confused by various impressions that you’ve had over the 
years about the term B&B, so before taking the leap into innkeeping you want 
to know: What exactly is a bed & breakfast? You can’t run something if you 
don’t have a clear picture of what it is in your mind.
Comparing a B&B to a country inn and home-stay
Because the word inn is used interchangeably 
when referring to bed & breakfasts and country 
inns, and because home-stays rent rooms and 
provide breakfast, there can be confusion in the 
distinctions between B&Bs, country inns, and 
home-stays.
 ✓ Country inn: This kind of lodging property 
has many of the characteristics of a B&B, 
but serves an evening meal in addition to 
breakfast. Some country inns serve dinner 
to overnight guests only, and the cost of 
dinner and breakfast is generally included 
in the room rate (called the Modified 
American Plan). A country inn with a full-
service restaurant serves meals to the gen-
eral public. Generally the owner or owners 
are actively involved in the daily operations 
of the inn, and often live on site. To be a 
country inn, a property does not have to be 
located in a rural area, although historically 
restaurants were added so that travelers in 
remote locations could enjoy a good eve-
ning meal.
 ✓ Home-stay: This is an owner-occupied pri-
vate home that rents rooms to earn addi-
tional income while the owners continue 
their present employment or retirement. 
Although breakfast may be included in the 
room rate, in general, home-stays lack the 
emphasis on unique accommodations and 
personal service typical of a B&B stay.
If you provide a high level of service with a per-
sonal touch, offer generous hospitality and good 
value with unique ambiance and surroundings 
in individually decorated rooms that are clean 
and comfortable, then you are providing your 
guests with a fabulous lodging experience — 
no matter what you call it!

11
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
According to the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII), 
a bed & breakfast is a lodging establishment where the owner/host typically 
lives on the premises. Breakfast is served to overnight guests and may be 
quite lavish. A professional B&B meets all the appropriate zoning, safety, 
health, and legal requirements of the state and local government. The owner 
or owners provide a high degree of personal service to guests. Many B&Bs 
have been inspected by state associations or inspection rating services such 
as AAA, Mobil guides, or Canada Select. Small B&Bs usually provide a part-
time or seasonal occupation for the owners, who do most of the work, often 
with some help for housekeeping and other chores. Larger B&Bs provide the 
primary financial support for the owner(s) and generally require their full-
time, active involvement in the daily operations with the help of employees.
From there, the choice is yours. You can open a bed & breakfast in the city or 
in the country, in a quaint Victorian mansion or in a conventional home (see 
Chapter 2 for more about your options). I’ve even heard of B&Bs on boats, in 
treehouses, and in old jails!
Dispelling myths: What a B&B is not
As an innkeeper, you need to know and confront head-on some of the miscon-
ceptions and general perceptions that the traveling public and the media may 
have about bed & breakfasts. Some of these are based on out-dated notions, 
and others have evolved as a result of confusion with home-stays. Tackling 
these mistaken beliefs and knowing what information you need to provide, 
especially for first-time B&B goers, is helpful in your marketing efforts (see 
Chapters 8 and 15). Some mistaken notions and their clarifications are:
 
✓ B&Bs are cheap and second-rate. While the values offered by bed & 
breakfasts can make them an economical alternative to other accom-
modations, B&B guests generally find upscale amenities, such as luxury 
linens, fresh flowers, fine china, gourmet breakfasts, and special touches 
not found even at higher-priced hotels.
 
✓ Breakfast is family-style with other guests. This is true at many inns, 
and part of the appeal of a B&B is the camaraderie. However, many 
B&Bs offer individual tables or even breakfast delivered to the guest’s 
room. Knowing who your guest is allows you to offer a breakfast setting 
conducive to your target guest (see Chapter 10 for information on break-
fast settings).
 
✓ Bathrooms are shared. According to PAII, nearly 95 percent of inns include 
private baths, and many now offer private in-room Jacuzzis for two.

12
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
 
✓ Privacy is limited. Actually, professional innkeepers use their people 
skills and know when to engage guests in conversation and when to give 
them privacy (see Chapter 12 for more on honing your communication 
skills). They also take into account thin walls and squeaky staircases by 
soundproofing when possible.
 
✓ The breakfasts are fattening and unhealthy. Most innkeepers offer a 
variety of food choices at breakfast, and many ask about dietary restric-
tions when taking guests’ reservations. (See Chapter 10 for information 
about dietary requests that you will encounter.)
 
✓ Running a bed & breakfast is a hobby. By reading this book and fol-
lowing the advice it contains, you know this notion is far from true; how-
ever, don’t be surprised by how often guests will ask “So, what do you 
really do?”
 
✓ B&Bs are just a room, and they’re boring. On the contrary, many bed & 
breakfast inns provide activities for their guests free of charge or have 
deals with local vendors to offer guests discounted rates. Embrace this 
aspect of a B&B stay and offer activities and services appropriate for 
your guests.
 
✓ B&Bs have too many rules. While it is true that a few innkeepers take 
creating policies to such an extreme that guests can’t relax and enjoy 
their getaway, the majority of innkeepers focus their concern on the 
safety, comfort, and enjoyment of their guests. (Chapter 7 focuses on 
establishing your policies.) Not furnishing your inn with irreplaceable, 
valuable personal property and priceless family heirlooms will help you 
to relax, welcome, and enjoy your guests.
Finding Out What It Takes 
to Be an Innkeeper
You must have multiple skills, personality traits, and personal characteristics 
to be a successful innkeeper. The following sections describe these qualities in 
greater depth and comprise a job description of sorts for aspiring innkeepers.
Communicating effectively
Before taking the plunge into innkeeping, you need to take an inventory of 
your own people skills, past the point of being a friendly person. To be a 

13
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
successful innkeeper, you must like people, be willing to interact with them 
on many levels, and possess some innate higher-level communication skills, 
such as:
 
✓ You should have the ability to break down communication barriers 
gently and graciously by taking cues from your guests. This means 
being able to figure out what the guests’ needs are and what, if possible, 
can be done to make your guests comfortable. It also means knowing 
when guests want to be engaged in conversation and when they’d rather 
be left alone. Some people are naturally better than others at reading 
situations, but luckily, making guests comfortable is a skill that you can 
continue to perfect with each guest interaction.
 
✓ You need to be a skillful leader, which means being competently in 
charge. Guests sense incompetence, so you always want to appear con-
fident and in control. If you’re not in charge, guests will immediately try 
and take advantage of you. From your first contact with each guest, be 
it by e-mail, by phone, or in person, always remain in charge by creating 
policies and an environment that you’re comfortable offering to guests; 
then stick within the boundaries that you create for this environment. 
Guests will try and dictate everything from your reservation policies to 
room assignments and menu choices, but you must remain in control.
 
✓ You need to be skillful at communicating nonverbally. Studies have 
shown that only 7 percent of what we “hear” from in-person commu-
nication is actual words. The remaining 93 percent of the message we 
receive comes not from the literal words spoken, but rather from the 
following:
 
• The tone and pitch of a voice
 
• The speed at which words are delivered
 
• Facial expressions, including mouth, chin, eye and eyebrow move-
ments, and the position of the head as well as hand and body ges-
tures and eye contact
 
• Emotional responses such as sighing, laughing, snickering, and 
crying
 
• Physiological responses such as rapid breathing, eyes filling with 
tears, choking on words, and so forth
 
 These signals make nonverbal communication a very powerful way of 
“hearing” guests and communicating with them. Listening to guests’ 
nonverbal communication and being in command of your own nonverbal 
correspondences is an art and a skill that savvy innkeepers employ and 
perfect over time.

14
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
Examining other necessary traits
Don’t underestimate the value of your strong passion to become an inn-
keeper. Not only is it an important factor in determining your success, it’s 
also what carries you through the roughest and most exhausting times. But 
passion and determination alone aren’t enough to make your bed & breakfast 
successful. In addition to the high-level communication skills I discuss in the 
preceding section, here are some other key traits you must possess:
 
✓ Endurance and stamina. This is a biggie and a lot tougher than it 
sounds. Even when you’re tired or don’t feel well, beds have to be made, 
breakfast must be prepared, toilets must be cleaned, and everything 
must be done in a cheerful manner. At 10 p.m., you may find yourself 
still manning the fort because guests you’re expecting haven’t called to 
let you know they’re running late or, worse, not coming at all. And so 
you wait, knowing all the while that you need to be up at 6 a.m. to start 
breakfast.
 
✓ A willingness to see damages as a part of doing business. Even when 
you take precautions to protect your inn, some damages are bound to 
occur. Guests spill things, drop things, break things, wet the bed, and 
more, so you should never put anything in your rooms or common areas 
that you can’t bear to part with.
 
✓ Tolerance to entertain a variety of people — even those you don’t 
like. You know who I mean, those who insist on talking politics from 
their point of view as if it were the only point of view, discuss their 
medical conditions with a level of detail that is not only inappropriate 
but annoying, share their religious views with complete disregard for 
anyone else’s beliefs, or monopolize the conversation and talk only 
about themselves. Add to this the fact that many of these people are 
always complaining about something. Not only do you need to entertain 
these people, but you also need to skillfully manage the situation to 
minimize their interference with your other guests’ enjoyment.
 
✓ An affinity for multitasking. You need to be adept at working in a 
fast-paced environment with frequent interruptions. This could mean 
anything from taking a reservation while cleaning a bathroom to telling 
guests about area activities while buying tomatoes.
 
✓ Organizational skills. You need to be organized in order to keep a 
housekeeping schedule, plan and prepare meals, shop for the inn, 
manage your advertising, take care of bookkeeping and banking, handle 
repairs, meet required reporting deadlines, take care of current and 
future guests, and more.
 
✓ Willingness to learn from your experiences. Successful innkeepers con-
stantly find more efficient ways to use their time, from streamlining meal 
preparation to making their housekeeping routine more productive. 
They discover new bookkeeping functions and marketing techniques. 
Having an open and flexible mind makes the job easier over time.

15
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
 
✓ Patience. An innkeeper’s days are filled with answering the same ques-
tions over and over, even after the requested information has been pro-
vided. Say you show a couple at check-in how to use the remote for the 
TV and point out the card in the room that provides complete instruc-
tions on operating the TV. You go to their room later and patiently help 
them with it again, only to get another call from them that night asking 
you to show them how to use the remote. Each time, you respond with 
patience and a smile, even though you can’t help thinking to yourself, 
Why don’t they get it? or How many more times will I have to show them? 
At first, you’re happy to help your guests, but fast-forward to the 100th 
and then the 1,000th time you’ve answered the same question: Can you 
still do it with the same patience and smile?
 
✓ Willingness to make personal sacrifices. Being an innkeeper invariably 
means missing some family and personal functions. When this hap-
pens, you must be able to hide your feelings of disappointment for your 
guests’ sake.
 
In addition to all of this, you must find time to take care of yourself. An inn-
keeper’s job is never done. Even on days when there are no guests at your inn, 
you should expect to be preparing for them by working on your marketing 
plan, baking ahead, cleaning, and performing maintenance and upkeep. When 
guests are staying at the inn, you may be hoping for a little quiet time alone 
in the afternoon, only to find that your guests prefer to hang around and visit. 
None of these dynamics are bad; they’re simply a reality of innkeeping and the 
lifestyle you sign on to when you decide to run a bed & breakfast. But remem-
ber, your job description doesn’t come with personal leave, vacation time, or 
days off, so you have to carve out this time for yourself (Chapter 16 shows you 
how). Be wise, and build it into your business plan.
Being a Jack or Jill of all trades
If I were to write a job description for the position of innkeeper it would prob-
ably read something like this: Knowing how to do everything and being ready 
to do it at any time. Innkeepers wear many hats and walk in many shoes, from 
cook to cleaner and from greeter to gardener. I can’t think of any other pro-
fession that combines the knowledge from as many different disciplines as 
innkeeping does.
 
Many new innkeepers make the mistake of downplaying the need for experi-
ence, or at least a little knowledge, and overestimating their abilities in the 
many areas that affect the success of a bed & breakfast. While many jobs can 
be outsourced, knowledge in some areas is indispensable. For example, you 
may outsource your accounting and tax preparation to a CPA or accountant, 
but knowing how to generate and read a profit and loss statement (also called 
an income statement) from your bookkeeping software is essential for gauging 
the health of your business and comparing its success from year to year (see 
Chapter 15 for details on assessing your success).

16
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
While the following list by no means includes every role an innkeeper may be 
called upon to play, it gives you an idea of those areas in which a degree of pro-
ficiency is necessary. How do you measure up? You should be prepared to be a
 ✓ Bookkeeper
 ✓ Chef/short order cook
 ✓ Concierge
 ✓ Gardener
 ✓ Handyman/woman
 ✓ Housekeeper
 ✓ Interior decorator
 ✓ Safety coordinator
 ✓ Negotiator/mediator
 ✓ Marketer
 ✓ Personnel Director
 ✓ Webmaster
Lucky for you, this book helps you brush up on these skills and more. Turn to 
Chapter 6 for information on record-keeping, Chapter 10 for food preparation 
and recipe suggestions, Chapter 14 for help with hiring help, and Chapter 9 
for decorating tips. Chapter 13 gives you the lowdown on inn maintenance. 
Chapters 11 and 12 cover communication and guest relations, while Chapter 
8 provides an overview of marketing, including capitalizing on the possibili-
ties offered by the World Wide Web.
Making your job look easy 
 (and other secret skills)
The best innkeepers have a secret: They make everything look easy. Because 
successful innkeepers are so good at this, new innkeepers often underesti-
mate the variety of skills required to be a successful innkeeper, the energy 
necessary to be on duty 24/7/365, and the stamina to bring it all together. 
Making personal sacrifices
Many stories come to mind of professional 
innkeepers who understand that it’s show time 
24/7/365. One in particular is of innkeepers who 
were welcoming their guests when one of the 
innkeepers excused himself to take a phone 
call. It was on this call that he found out that 
his father had passed away. His partner con-
tinued checking in the current guests and the 
next group of guests. By the time yet another 
group of guests arrived, he was back helping to 
check them in. The guests never knew what the 
innkeeper was going through personally and 
enjoyed their stays immensely. It’s this type of 
personal sacrifice that many innkeepers make. 
Situations like these are also why it’s important 
to have an interim innkeeper or competent staff 
on hand should you need to be away from the 
inn suddenly. (See Chapter 14 for information on 
finding an interim innkeeper.)

17
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
Guests can’t enjoy themselves if they feel they are an imposition, so innkeep-
ers go out of their way to hide the fact that, sometimes, they are.
In addition to making your job look easier than it is, to be a successful inn-
keeper you need to have the following “secret” skills, which aren’t always 
revealed to your guests:
 
✓ A competitive streak: Even though you may be on friendly terms and 
generally work cooperatively with other innkeepers in your area, inn-
keepers are competitive. You want your inn to be the best at meeting 
your guests’ needs and expectations.
 
✓ A talent for managing time wisely: Out of sheer necessity, you must call 
upon your creative flair to practice good time management. You need 
to quickly decide which items or tasks are time wasters and must be 
eliminated, which tasks need to be minimized, and which need to stay in 
place and be streamlined so that more time is carved out for running the 
B&B and taking care of yourself.
 
✓ A well-calculated focus: Innkeepers are akin to magicians in a lot of 
ways — their focus, preparation, and practice make everything fall into 
place and seem so easy! With a lot of hard work and a little bit of magic, 
your guests can enjoy the fabulous mouth-watering breakfast you pre-
pare, your immaculately clean inn, and your beautifully manicured lawn 
without ever knowing how many hours go into the details to make all of 
this possible during their brief visits.
Knowing What You Want from Your B&B
If you have the personality traits and skills described in the previous sections 
of this chapter, you have most of what it takes to be a successful innkeeper. 
But while having these skills and traits may enable you to go through the 
motions of being an innkeeper, to be a really great innkeeper you need to 
have a clear understanding of what you expect to get out of your B&B.
In much of the rest of this book, the focus is on what you will provide to your 
guests, but this section is about what’s in it for you. Will you be happy? You 
probably won’t be a good innkeeper if you’re not. Will your bed & breakfast 
and the love and sweat that you put into it provide you with a good return? This 
doesn’t have to be defined only in terms of monetary success. Your success 
is also defined by the achievement of the goals that you set for yourself — 
your reasons for running a bed & breakfast. Figuring out how you define your 
own success and happiness can help you decide whether running a bed & 
breakfast is the right choice for you.

Part I: Inn the Beginning 
Looking at your motivation: The pros 
and cons of innkeeping
The most common reason to start a new business is to make money. While 
innkeepers do want to run a profitable bed & breakfast, this is often not the 
only reason — and many times not the first reason — they give for getting 
into the industry. Although this doesn’t mean you won’t make money, the 
point is to understand fully what you plan to invest in the business in terms 
of money, time, energy, and commitment, and then decide whether you have 
realistic expectations of what you intend to get out of it.
 
If you decide to forgo taking a salary in the beginning, be sure to get financial 
advice. Although you’ll be working, you won’t be contributing to social secu-
rity, which could adversely affect your benefits later in life.
Ask ten innkeepers why they decided to become innkeepers and you’ll proba-
bly get ten different answers. Popular reasons include, but are not limited to,
 
✓ To be my own boss
 
✓ To live in a nicer home than I could afford otherwise
 
✓ To work from home so I can be around my family and my children
 
✓ To work with my spouse or chosen partner
 
✓ To meet new and interesting people and/or relieve loneliness
 
✓ To take advantage of my love to cook, entertain, and be creative
 
✓ To be able to restore an old property
Your list may look completely different than the list above, or it may be a 
combination of some of the above reasons and some of your own. The most 
important thing is to have a firm list of your goals and a clear understanding 
of your motivation and expectations before you start out.
You can’t look only at the bright side. Before making the decision to become 
an innkeeper, you need to weigh the disadvantages of innkeeping as well, 
some of which include:
 
✓ Long hours
 
✓ Limited income
 
✓ Heavy startup costs
 
✓ Lack of privacy for you and your family
 
✓ Reduced family time
 
✓ Hard manual labor
 
✓ Menial and repetitive tasks that are performed over and over

 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
Pulling all the pieces together
Being an innkeeper can be exciting. However, just because it seems like a 
good idea, it may or may not enable you to meet your personal and financial 
goals. Without setting these goals, you can’t judge your success. Start by 
making a clear list of what you want to achieve personally, then figure out 
exactly what type of commitment you’re willing to make to get there. With all 
this in mind, use your business plan to determine how closely you will come 
to meeting your financial goals. (See Chapter 3 for help in creating a business 
plan and using it as a road map for your business’s growth.) By looking at 
the combination of your business plan and your personal and financial goals, 
you’ll be able to clearly define what success means to you and whether inn-
keeping is the best means to achieve it.
Juggling the Lifestyle of Innkeeping
Adapting to the innkeeping lifestyle is tough for new innkeepers. Figuring out 
how to juggle the reality of the demands that this lifestyle brings is no easy task.
Balancing your business 
and personal lives
When you live where you work and work where you live, separating your 
business life from your personal life can be a challenge, but it’s a necessity. 
Even if you’re among the nearly 15 percent of innkeepers who live off prop-
erty, you still have a lot invested in your bed & breakfast and a vested inter-
est in making sure it maintains your personal touch. Either way, you’re going 
to find yourself juggling business decisions and personal obligations.
Running a bed & breakfast involves a huge time commitment. If your family 
will live at the inn, they should be involved in your decision to open a bed & 
breakfast because entertaining guests in your home will affect them. If you 
expect them to work in the business, you need an even greater commitment 
from them, and they should be part of establishing the division of labor.
 
See Chapter 3 for help allocating the responsibilities of various tasks, and 
check out Chapter 14 for details on getting extra help when you need it.
 
Family and friends may not share your devotion to your new profession. Some 
may think you’ve gone overboard, and many may not understand the tremen-
dous commitment you are undertaking. When possible, educate them and 
enlist their support.

20
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
Life happens, and you need to have a plan for how you intend to handle per-
sonal invitations and commitments that come up, such as attending a family 
wedding or scheduling required medical treatment for yourself. If you’re 
running the bed & breakfast with a partner, discuss ahead of time how you’ll 
handle various job duties and situations. If you’re a solo innkeeper, spend 
some time planning how you’ll make time for yourself and handle emergencies.
 
Budget time for yourself, whether it’s to take a walk in the park or to take a 
vacation. Personal time has a different meaning for everyone. Know what you 
need for yourself and carve out time for it in advance. (See Chapter 16 to find 
out how.) Otherwise, you’re unlikely to find the time you need, a situation that 
can lead to bitterness and, ultimately, poor guest services.
Understanding uncertainty
Getting used to uncertainty is part of settling in as an innkeeper. The best 
way to handle uncertainty is with flexibility. Being flexible means creating 
a plan for your business and understanding that your projections are only 
an educated guess. It also means knowing that your plans for each day are 
always tentative. You may begin your day with a list of chores and baking 
that you plan to do and end up spending the entire day rebuilding your 
kitchen drain after the waste disposal fails in the middle of breakfast.
 
Check references for repairmen and have their emergency numbers on hand 
ahead of time — preferably programmed into speed dial. You never know 
when you’ll need them. Don’t forget numbers for services such as pest control 
and tree removal.
As an innkeeper, you need to be flexible and ready for the unexpected not 
only in your activities, but in cash flow as well. This might sound scary — 
and it is. However, those who don’t overextend themselves — in either time 
or financial resources — can usually weather any storm.
One way to be prepared for uncertainty is for you, your partner, or a family 
member to keep an outside job. This may be beneficial for a variety of rea-
sons, two of which include:
 
✓ Extra income: Having an outside income may provide the necessary 
cash flow to support your lifestyle and bed & breakfast until the inn 
begins to turn a profit. Even after your inn is profitable, you may con-
tinue to work outside the inn to provide additional income or to enable 
you to hire staff. Having an outside source of income also helps to 
insulate you from the effects of uncertain economic and environmental 
factors that may affect your revenues. If you’re counting on an outside 
income to support your bed & breakfast, be sure you’re prepared for the 
possibility of losing your job.

21
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
 
✓ Benefits: Providing your own health and retirement benefits is expen-
sive, and many innkeepers keep their day jobs in order to keep their 
benefits.
 
 If you have benefits for yourself through your inn, you may be required 
to provide the same level of benefits to all employees. Check with your 
attorney to find out what’s required.
Your business plan (see Chapter 3 to devise one) can help you determine the 
projected amount of time you’ll need to spend working a job outside of the 
inn. Innkeepers juggle the running of their inns with their day jobs in a vari-
ety of ways, including:
 
✓ Hiring an assistant innkeeper either full- or part-time
 
✓ Catering only to weekend guests
 
✓ Running the inn on a part-time or seasonal basis
 
✓ Working just part-time outside the inn
Before You Take the Plunge: Finding 
Out All You Can about the B&B Biz
Fortunately, a plethora of resources is available to show you what it’s like to 
be an innkeeper before you invest a substantial amount of time or money. 
Use this book as your guide, and read and re-read every chapter to ensure 
you absorb all the valuable information. Then seek out and talk to other inn-
keepers by looking for one or more innkeeper networks, which offer a wealth 
of information and support. Too often, innkeepers fail or burn out because 
they haven’t done their research or feel alone in the major endeavor of run-
ning a bed & breakfast. With so many good resources available, there’s no 
reason for this to happen to you!
Talking to other successful innkeepers
No matter what stage of innkeeping you’re in, you’re not alone and never 
need to feel that you are. Savvy innkeepers take part in industry associa-
tions and forums to get support from others and answers to their questions. 
New innkeepers benefit from the wisdom of experienced innkeepers, and 
seasoned innkeepers benefit from the energy and enthusiasm of new innkeep-
ers. Innkeeper groups come in all shapes and sizes. I encourage you to get in 
touch with several. Here is some help in finding them:

22
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
 
✓ Innkeeper recommendations: Ask local innkeepers what associations 
and forums they find helpful. In addition to organized associations, 
many innkeepers have informal gatherings amongst themselves and you 
may be invited to participate.
 
✓ Local and regional associations: You can find these associations by 
doing a Google search. Enter your city or region and then the keyword 
phrase “bed breakfast association,” for example, Mystic CT bed breakfast 
association.
 
✓ State associations: Innkeepers in many states have joined together to 
form state associations. To see whether such an association exists in 
your state, perform a Google search by entering your state followed by 
the keyword search phrase “bed breakfast association,” for example, 
West Virginia bed breakfast association.
 
 Many state B&B associations have kits, research, and courses specifi-
cally for aspiring innkeepers who are thinking of opening a bed & break-
fast in their state.
 
✓ The Professional Association of Innkeepers International: Known as 
PAII (pronounced “pie”), you can look them up at www.paii.org. This 
worldwide organization provides education, information, networking, 
advocacy, business opportunities, online forums, and industry research 
for all aspects of the bed & breakfast industry. Each year the association 
hosts an industry conference and trade show that offer a wealth of edu-
cational seminars, panels, demonstrations, and opportunities and bring 
aspiring and seasoned innkeepers together with industry vendors and 
suppliers.
 
 The PAII annual conference and trade show and many state bed & break-
fast associations offer seminars just for aspiring innkeepers.
 
✓ Innkeeper forums: A forum is an online discussion group. It can be pri-
vate or public, and may or may not be monitored by a forum leader or 
group. Many forums are open to all innkeepers — all you have to do is 
register or join a particular association. Private forums are by invitation 
only. These forums aren’t trying to be exclusive; rather, they’re formed 
by innkeepers who want to converse freely amongst themselves without 
moderation or vendor involvement. Here are two of the most popular 
forums:
 
• The PAII Forum (www.paii.org): Participation in this active forum 
requires membership in the PAII. Innkeepers, aspiring innkeepers, 
and vendors interact, seeking and giving advice and referrals.
 
• Innspiring Forum (www.innspiring.com): This active forum is 
comprised of a group of innkeepers and a few vendors who daily 
share stories, ask each other questions, and discuss topics of inter-
est to the group, such as vendor recommendations, occupancy 
rates, handling specific guest situations, and so on.

23
 Chapter 1: So You Want to Open a B&B
Finding a class for aspiring innkeepers
Many classes and workshops are devoted to training aspiring innkeepers. 
The format and schedule of these classes differ, so take some time to find 
a class that you feel is best geared toward your needs. Classes are offered 
across the country and at a variety of times during the year, so with a little 
research, you should be able to find a convenient class near you. For help in 
finding classes for aspiring innkeepers, check these resources:
 
✓ PAII. Go to www.paii.org and click on Resources, Vendor 
Marketplace, Education & Events, and Workshops, respectively.
 
✓ State, local or regional B&B associations.
 
✓ Industry consultants. (See Chapter 3 to find a consultant.)
 
✓ Online B&B directories. (See Chapter 8 for information on how to find 
an online B&B directory.)
Taking a test drive
If you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and give innkeeping a test drive, you 
may want to consider taking a hands-on course offered at an individual inn or 
volunteering as an innkeeper.
 
✓ Hands-on training at an individual inn: Inns across the country offer 
these classes, usually on an individual basis. You should expect the 
class to be about a week in length with an organized course outline. At 
the beginning of the week, you typically learn through observation, and 
by the end of the week, most classes have you taking care of guests with 
the help of an experienced innkeeper in the background. The best way 
to find a hands-on training class is through bed & breakfast associations, 
by asking for a referral in an innkeeper forum, or by checking the new 
innkeeper resources section in many online directories.
 
✓ Volunteering as an innkeeper: You may consider contacting some inns 
in the area where you live to see whether any B&B owners would be 
interested in having you as a volunteer innkeeper. This arrangement 
could be for a few hours each day or for a few days at a time. While you 
aren’t paid, the experience you receive is invaluable, and you have a 
B&B owner or manager to ask questions about the business. If you vol-
unteer, remember that your primary focus is to be dedicated to keeping 
their inn running — not to constantly be asking questions.

Deciding on the Location 
and Style of Your B&B
In This Chapter
▶ Finding a location you’ll be happy and successful in
▶ Figuring out the personality and style of your B&B
▶ Deciding how big your bed & breakfast should be
C
hoosing the location and style of your bed & breakfast are important 
decisions in the formation of your business. By making these choices, 
you’re choosing your work environment, the location of the inn, and the type 
of guests you’ll attract.
In this chapter I help you balance the pros and cons of bed & breakfast loca-
tions and styles to meet your goals, whether you’re searching for a new loca-
tion or trying to decide whether your existing residence would be a good 
spot for a B&B. This is your business and you’re the boss, so I help you use 
that power to find a location and style for your business that make sense not 
only financially, but emotionally as well.
Choosing a Location for Your B&B
Location, location, location is a phrase that should ring in your mind as you 
search for the perfect spot for your bed & breakfast. The location you choose 
for your B&B will have a huge impact on your happiness, your inn’s success, 
and your ability to meet your goals, but you can’t find a good location until 
you know what you’re looking for. As you search for the perfect location, 
look for a venue that can fulfill both your business and personal goals.

26
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
When analyzing locations, the four most important questions to ask are:
 
✓ Will you be happy in the area?
 
✓ Will guests come?
 
✓ Will zoning be an issue?
 
✓ What do current area innkeepers have to say?
Whatever your reasons for opening a bed & breakfast, your location needs to 
be a balance between your personal preferences and business reality. In this 
section, you evaluate what you want in an area, look at whether the location 
can draw enough guests to keep you in business, make sure zoning laws fit 
your plans, and get some feedback from local innkeepers.
Identifying what you want in an area
When you choose the location for your inn, you make two decisions in one — 
where you will live and where you will work — and you need to be happy on 
both counts. The best way to prevent burnout is to love where you are and 
what you’re doing, so finding a location that you like is an important step in 
ensuring a great and long-lasting innkeeping career.
If you don’t choose your location carefully, you may find yourself loving your 
business but being unhappy in your location or loving your business and your 
location but not being as successful as you want to be. When you’re an inn-
keeper, changing your work environment — the location of your inn — isn’t 
as feasible as it is with most jobs, so choosing a comfortable environment at 
the outset is important.
You can open a bed & breakfast practically anywhere, so pick an area that 
makes sense to you. There are many questions you need to ask yourself and 
some self-analysis you need to perform in choosing your location. Even if the 
location is your current residence, you must conduct all the same evalua-
tions that you would for any other property. Some things to consider are
 
✓ Local activities and attractions that interest you: Basing your initial 
property search on your hobbies and interests increases the likelihood 
of your happiness, which in turn can lead to greater business satisfac-
tion and help you to avoid burnout. Do you want an area that offers 
skiing? Historical significance? The ocean?
 
✓ Climate: Conduct your search in an area where you find the climate 
agreeable. If, for example, you like cold weather, opening a B&B on a ski 
slope in Vermont may be a good match for you.

27
 Chapter 2: Deciding on the Location and Style of Your B&B
 
✓ Downtime and seasonal closures: How much to do you want to work? 
Do you want to work 7 days a week, 365 days a year, or do you only 
want to work on the weekends? Do you want to be able to take several 
months off to travel on your own?
 
 If you’d like to take winters off, for example, you might want to start 
your search in an area like central Maine, where few guests visit during 
the winter. Because winter is the slow season there, you wouldn’t be 
giving up a great deal of income by being closed then. On the other 
hand, if you want a full-time inn, you’d be better off in a location where it 
makes more sense from a financial point of view to be open year-round.
 
✓ Outside employment opportunities: If you or your partner intend to 
work outside of the inn, are there sufficient job opportunities in the 
area?
After you narrow down your choices to an area that seems right for you, you 
need to determine whether it makes business sense, that is, whether guests 
will come.
If you build it, will they come? Gauging 
an area’s drawing power
While it’s important to be happy in the area where you live, the only way to 
run a successful bed & breakfast is to be located in an area that guests will 
visit. The bed & breakfast inn experience is unique, but it’s rarely a destina-
tion in and of itself, so you need to look for area events, attractions, activi-
ties, and businesses that can bring guests to your inn.
To determine an area’s potential as a location for your bed & breakfast, you 
need to conduct a market analysis. This is the process of taking a close look 
at your area to understand who the potential guests are; what the competi-
tion is like; when guests are most likely to visit; and what activities, attrac-
tions, and events bring them to the area. In this section, I discuss what draws 
guests to a region, what may keep them away, and how to analyze whether an 
area can likely support your inn.
Knowing what brings guests to an area
Guests need a reason to visit your area and things to do while they’re there 
before they’re likely to stay with you. Knowing the types of activities, attrac-
tions, events, and businesses that bring guests to a given area helps you 
determine how good that potential location would be. Use Table 2-1 as a 
starting point to check off what brings guests to the area you’re considering 
and what they do once they get there.

28
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
 
Look beyond peak weekends and special events, when you should expect to 
be full. Analyze what brings guests to the area mid-week and during slower 
seasons.

Red flags: Recognizing what keeps guests away
Buying or starting up a bed & breakfast is a big investment. Picking the wrong 
location could mean losing your life’s savings and your home, so knowing 
what to avoid is just as important as knowing what to look for in a location. 
Think twice before ignoring any of the following red flags:
 
✓ An overabundance of lodging choices with low occupancy: If a number 
of B&Bs and hotels are already struggling to survive in an area, your inn 
is unlikely to be able to attract guests that they couldn’t.
 
✓ A location that’s not a destination and on the way to nowhere: You’ll 
have a tough time filling your rooms in a location that doesn’t draw 

29
 Chapter 2: Deciding on the Location and Style of Your B&B
guests through attractions and isn’t a convenient stopover point on a 
popularly traveled route.
 
✓ A place that’s hard to get to: Your inn needs to be accessible. Say 
you fall in love with a beautiful seaside cottage that you think would 
make the perfect B&B, but the roads to get to the town it’s located in 
are nearly nonexistent. Although the privacy such a location offers is 
appealing, your target market would be very limited and you’d have to 
spend a lot of effort and money advertising to fill your rooms.
 
✓ An area that’s economically depressed: Not only are economically 
depressed areas usually not tourist attractions, but you also need to 
consider whether you or your partner would be able to find desirable 
jobs outside of the inn if your business plan requires a second income to 
sustain the inn.
Checking the numbers: Analyzing an area’s potential market
A variety of resources can help you conduct a market analysis to weigh the 
pros and cons of your potential location. They can assist you in determining 
whether an area you’re considering has the potential to attract guests and 
sustain your bed & breakfast. Here are some good places to start:
 
✓ SCORE: SCORE (www.score.org) is a nonprofit association and a 
resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). 
SCORE counselors are usually retired business owners, executives, and 
corporate leaders who are experienced in analyzing business situa-
tions. They volunteer their time to help new small business owners, like 
you, get started. Contact SCORE to see whether your local chapter has 
anyone who can help you perform your market analysis.
 
✓ Inn consultants: Inn consultants are professionals who can help you 
objectively evaluate an area and its viability as the location for your bed 
& breakfast. (See Chapter 3 for help in finding an inn consultant.)
 
✓ State and local tourism boards: Contact by phone or, if possible, visit 
your state tourism board and introduce yourself as a prospective inn-
keeper. Ask for a list of lodging establishments and tourist attractions 
in the area you’re considering for your bed & breakfast. Develop a 
rapport, and ask about high and low seasons and the main reasons 
guests visit the area. You should be able to get a wealth of information 
on lodging statistics, occupancy rates, and area attractions. Use Table 
2-1 to keep track of the unique characteristics of each area you’re inter-
ested in.
 
✓ Chamber of commerce or visitors bureau: As with the state tourism 
board, introduce yourself as a prospective innkeeper. This visit should 
always be in person. Let them know how excited you are about the pos-
sibility of opening a B&B in their area. Solicit their advice and engage 
their help by asking them for detailed information about what brings 
guests to the area and what the high and low seasons are for tourism. 
Continue to add to Table 2-1 with any additional information that they 

30
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
provide. Ask them about the occupancy of other lodging establishments 
in the area.
 
 If you find yourself evaluating extremely positive reports on how popu-
lar the area is, remember that the chamber’s purpose is to serve as a 
cheerleader for the area, so the advice you receive may not be com-
pletely objective.
Watching out for unfriendly zoning laws
 
Without proper zoning, you won’t be able to operate your business. Many bed 
& breakfasts have failed because of unfriendly zoning restrictions. Check local 
zoning laws and restrictions before falling in love with a location or property, 
and you’ll save yourself a lot of grief, wasted time, and aggravation.
Among other restrictions, states and local areas may
 
✓ Prohibit bed & breakfasts entirely
 
✓ Limit the number of rooms and overnight guests you can have
 
✓ Dictate the type of kitchen you must install (commercial kitchens are 
very expensive)
 
✓ Regulate what you can serve for breakfast
 
✓ Prohibit you from having a sign outside your inn
Going into an area thinking you can get a conditional use permit is risky and 
rarely pays off. Make sure you can live with all applicable zoning laws and 
that the restrictions they pose fit into your business plan. (See Chapters 4 
and 5 for more info on zoning considerations.)
Asking other innkeepers about the area
When you’re seriously considering an area because you want to find a prop-
erty for your bed & breakfast there or because you’ve found a property that 
you’re seriously thinking about making an offer on, staying at other local 
lodging accommodations, as a paying guest, is recommended. (Before doing 
so, be sure to read the section “Getting ideas by staying at other B&Bs” later 
in this chapter for some important warnings and considerations.) When you 
take these scout-it-out trips, try to find out the following:
 
✓ Are there area associations that the innkeeper belongs to or recommends?
 
✓ How long has the innkeeper been in the area?
 
✓ What does the innkeeper like and dislike about innkeeping in the area?

31
 Chapter 2: Deciding on the Location and Style of Your B&B
Envisioning Your B&B Style
After you’ve narrowed down some possible locations, the next step is to 
determine the type of B&B you’d like to own. The best way to think about 
this is to consider what you’d be comfortable selling. Your bed & breakfast 
is a business, and you are selling the experience of staying at your inn. Bed 
& breakfast shapes, sizes, and personalities are as unique as those of their 
innkeepers. Your goal is to find a balance between the style of B&B that you 
want to own, who you want your potential guests to be, and the personal and 
financial goals you have for your business.
Finding a style that best reflects you
Basing your inn’s focus on your likes and hobbies — such as restoring old 
homes, gardening, wine, motorcycles, skiing, hunting, antiquing, and so on — 
helps everything else fall into place. Oftentimes the personality of a property 
is defined by the type of property that it is, be it a farm, a historic property, 
an elegant Victorian, and so on. You want to be sure that your personality 
and the inn’s personality are in synch.
For instance, consider Pleasant Bay Bed & Breakfast & Llama Keep, which 
has been serving guests for nearly 20 years. More than 50 percent of their 
business comes from repeat guests and referrals. When looking for their 
location, the couple who own the inn knew that he had always wanted to be 
a farmer and she loved llamas from her days in the Peace Corps. When they 
found a large piece of property on the coast of Maine, they knew they had 
found a comfortable place where they could welcome guests, he could live 
his dream of farming, and she could have her llamas. Today the bed & break-
fast is run on a 110-acre working llama farm. This works for them because the 
location they chose and the property’s personality support the lifestyle they 
were seeking.
In contrast, the owners of Blair Hill Inn in central Maine had traveled for 
their corporate careers and wanted to get away from hotels. They knew they 
liked skiing, cooking, entertaining, keeping grounds, historic properties, and 
renovating. They wanted to be busy most of the year, but also wanted a B&B 
that would allow them some time for themselves. With these aspects in mind, 
they looked for a location that had natural seasonal closures and times when 
few guests visited (they usually close in April and November, accordingly). 
They found an historic inn in need of renovation, and have turned it into a 
successful bed & breakfast business.
 
Innkeeping is a full-time job, so just because you love to ski and find the per-
fect location for your inn in a ski area, don’t be surprised if you don’t have as 
much time — or any time in the start-up years — as you’d like to devote to 
skiing.

32
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
Matching your B&B style to the 
guests you want to attract
Part of an innkeeper’s job is to make innkeeping look easy. Hosting and serv-
ing people is easier when you know what they want and can relate to their 
needs. For example, it would be easy for you to host business travelers if 
you’d just left the corporate world, because you’d understand the needs and 
demands of business travelers. However, it would be difficult for you to host 
guests who came to visit your area’s many wineries if you didn’t know any-
thing about wine.
The style of your inn and the service you offer should support the guests 
you’re trying to attract. Characterizing those guests can help define the style 
of your bed & breakfast. Here’s how to create a style targeted to your guests:
 
1. Start by identifying who your guests will be.
 
 Ask yourself what type of people will be staying at your inn. For exam-
ple, will they be families on vacation, business travelers, or couples 
seeking a quick weekend getaway?
 
2. Create a guest profile.
 
 Think about the age, education, hobbies, interests, affiliations, prefer-
ences, and income level of the guests you hope to attract, as well as the 
geographic location you expect to draw them from.
 
3. Identify the reasons for their travel.
 
 Make a list of the reasons guests will be visiting your area. For example, 
will they be sightseeing, visiting wineries, or passing through on their 
way to another destination?
 
4. Decide how your inn will accommodate your target guests.
 
 Make sure your inn will offer what the market wants. For example, if you 
want to cater to business travelers, your guest rooms don’t need to be 
drenched with antiques, but they need to be large enough to provide 
comfortable work areas. Guests on romantic getaways, on the other 
hand, may care less about early breakfast times and more about whirl-
pools and fireplaces.
 
5. Define what makes your B&B distinctive and unique.
 
 Because guests have many lodging choices, it’s your job to define what 
makes your inn unique and why guests should choose your inn over 
another B&B or hotel in the area. Perhaps you’ll offer flexible breakfast 
times to business travelers or breakfast in bed for those on a romantic 
getaway. Or maybe you’ll serve as an expert concierge who’s able to 
handle special requests or suggest the best places to visit.

33
 Chapter 2: Deciding on the Location and Style of Your B&B
Getting ideas by staying at other B&Bs
 
Because good innkeepers make the job of innkeeping look easy, merely stay-
ing at other B&Bs is not a good indication of what the lifestyle of innkeeping is 
like or what the job of an innkeeper entails. (See Chapter 1 for information on 
what it’s like to be an innkeeper.)
Staying at other B&Bs is a good way, however, to get an idea of what you like and 
don’t like as a guest. It’s a great way to figure out what you want to offer your 
own guests and how you may or may not want to do things at your own bed & 
breakfast. You can and should sleep around. When you do, be on the lookout for
 
✓ Amenities you like
 
✓ Policies you like and don’t like
 
✓ Room furnishings you like
 
✓ Breakfast ideas and settings
You may want to explain the vision of your B&B to the innkeeper and ask for 
his opinion. This is a touchy exercise, but one I recommend. Use your people 
skills to determine how comfortable the innkeeper is talking with you. The 
level of support you’re likely to receive differs by areas. Some areas are very 
competitive and others are very collaborative; you should quickly assess this 
and tailor your questions accordingly.
 
It’s important to remember that no matter how much help an innkeeper wants 
to offer you, he’s running a business. To get the most out of the encounter 
and be considerate of the innkeeper’s time, keep your questions brief and tar-
geted. He has other guests to serve, bathrooms to clean, and errands to run. 
Here are two important “don’ts”:
 
✓ Don’t monopolize innkeepers’ time, thus keeping them from their other 
guests or duties.
 
✓ Don’t expect them to provide you with training. You are only paying to 
be a guest, not to take a workshop. (See Chapter 1 for advice and train-
ing resources.)
Deciding How Big Your B&B Should Be
Ask ten people how big your bed & breakfast should be, and you’ll probably 
get ten different answers. The size of your B&B is ultimately determined by 
local zoning laws, your personal and financial resources, your objectives, 
and careful planning and projections. Here are some things to consider when 
trying to decide how big your bed & breakfast should be:

34
Part I: Inn the Beginning 
 
✓ What you can afford: How much you can afford is directly related to 
how much money you can put down and what you’ll have in reserve. 
At a minimum, you need money for a down payment. While not easy to 
secure, this amount can range from as little as 10 percent down with an 
SBA 7A loan program to 25 percent down for a commercial loan through 
a bank. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for information on financing.)
 
 You may need money for closing costs, renovations, or improvements, 
and, often, to bring a property up to code. You also need funds for mar-
keting and furnishing the inn. All of these calculations should be worked 
out by creating a business plan to determine what you can realistically 
afford. (See Chapter 3 for help in creating a business plan.)
 
✓ How many rooms you need to be profitable: I often hear that you need 
at least 5 to 10 rooms to be profitable. While this is not an unrealistic 
number, many things contribute to the calculation of profitability, 
including the cost of your debt service and your occupancy rate.
 
 For example, in 2007 InnMatchmakers, specialty inn brokers in Colorado, 
helped a young couple purchase a small, non-operating, historic B&B in 
the Colorado mountains for $350,000. With only three guest rooms, the 
couple worked hard to market the property. They expanded by adding a 
fourth guest room, and at the end of their first year in business, had booked 
nearly $90,000 in gross revenues. Sometimes, size isn’t all that matters!
 
✓ How much staff you plan to hire: The bigger the inn, the more likely 
you’ll need to hire staff to assist you.
 
✓ How much you want to work: The bigger the inn, the bigger the mort-
gage and the more nights you’ll need to fill your rooms.
 
✓ Local and state zoning and licensing laws: Zoning and licensing laws often 
restrict such things as the number of rooms you may have at your inn, 
the maximum length of guest stays, breakfast regulations, and how big 
each room must be. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for more information on zoning.)
Ensuring room to grow
Entering innkeeping with the vision of success 
means considering how you will grow your busi-
ness not only at the outset but also well into the 
future. At some point, you may decide to grow 
your business through expansion, so it’s a good 
idea to allow for that possibility from the get-go. 
Factors that may affect your ability to expand in 
the future include
 ✓ Whether local and state zoning laws allow 
expansion
 ✓ Whether the building lends itself to additions
 ✓ Whether there’s enough physical property 
to support expansion, including room for 
additional parking
Consider these issues before investing time 
and money in either buying an existing inn or 
in finding a suitable location to build your bed & 
breakfast business.

T
urn your dream into a reality by putting your vision 
on paper and developing a road map for your suc-
cess. I show you how to create a business plan and go 
about getting advice from experts in the field. I also help 
you weigh the decision of purchasing an existing inn or 
building one from scratch. If you decide that buying an 
existing inn is the way to go, you come to understand the 
process from offer to close, what to be careful of, and 
how to transition the inn from the previous innkeeper’s 
turf to something you can call your own. If your plan is to 
build an inn or convert an existing property, I give you an 
overview of this process and warn you about the most 
common pitfalls other innkeepers have encountered.

▶ Getting expert advice from CPAs or accountants, lawyers, and consultants
▶ Creating a road map for your business with a business plan
▶ Creating financial forecasts
C
reating a plan for your business is as important as creating a plan for 
any major event in your life. Created correctly, your business plan will 
give you clear direction through the start-up phase of your business. In the 
process, you’ll be assembling the information you need to create a loan pack-
age to secure financing. After your new business is up and running, your plan 
will keep you focused and on track as your business grows and matures.
In this chapter, I help you find the resources and experts who can help you 
answer the tough questions it takes to decide whether the lifestyle of inn-
keeping can meet your financial goals. I help you create a plan for your busi-
ness that can be used to get financing, and then I help you plan for the future 
prosperity of your bed & breakfast.
Getting Expert Advice
If you’re like most innkeepers, you’re investing your life’s savings into your 
home and business together. Knowing how to separate your business and 
personal space from a legal and financial point of view has some unique 
twists and requires advice from experts.

38
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Bringing an accountant 
and lawyer on-board
Two of the most important experts you need to hire at the onset are an 
accountant and a lawyer. They can assist you in making crucial organiza-
tional decisions, and make sure you’ve covered all the bases.
Hiring an accountant
Finding an accountant or certified public accountant (CPA) who is familiar 
with the lodging industry — and bed & breakfasts in particular — helps to 
ensure that you set up your books to record your business and personal 
expenses correctly from the start. Asking other innkeepers or innkeeper con-
sultants for recommendations is the best way to find a CPA or accountant 
who understands the nuances of bed & breakfast accounting procedures. 
(See Chapter 1 for help in finding innkeeper resources.) If you can’t find 
someone with first-hand knowledge of the industry, make sure the person you 
select is used to accommodating the individual needs of small businesses.
Have your CPA or accountant help you customize your accounts to meet 
your business’s needs. (Table 6-1 in Chapter 6 shows a sample chart of 
accounts for a bed & breakfast.) At the end of the year, ask her to prepare the 
journal entries for more complicated items, such as depreciation.
Seeking advice from a lawyer
Finding a lawyer with a good corporate, business, and contract law back-
ground who understands the needs of a small business will help you get 
the best answers to your legal questions. You want a lawyer who can help 
you determine the best organization for your business. During the course 
of operating your bed & breakfast, you’ll probably also want legal advice on 
such matters as the wording of your policies (to be sure they’re clear but not 
discriminatory) and the handling of gift certificates, as well as the review of 
contracts and other documents that affect the business.
Many innkeepers have difficulty finding lawyers who have experience in the 
bed & breakfast industry. Remember that your lawyer (and CPA or accoun-
tant for that matter) doesn’t necessarily need to live close to you. Of course, 
she must know federal tax laws, and if she doesn’t live within your state 
or jurisdiction, be certain she has an extensive working knowledge of the 
tax laws in your state or jurisdiction. You can contact B&B organizations 
such as the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII; www.
paii.org) or your local B&B association for lawyer recommendations (see 
Chapter 1 for help in finding innkeeper resources).

39
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
Asking key questions of your lawyer and accountant
Just like every other small business owner, you’ll have specific questions 
about running your business that should be reviewed by a lawyer, CPA, or 
accountant. In the bed & breakfast industry, the answers are very seldom 
simple or mutually exclusive. For example, living in the same building and 
space that houses your business creates issues about how much space is 
used for personal purposes and, therefore, what percentage of your expenses 
qualifies as a business deduction. This, and many other questions unique to 
your B&B, cannot be covered in a book like this, but the next sections help 
you put together a list of questions to get the ball rolling.
Structuring your business
Your business is a legal entity, and you need to decide what legal form the 
business should take. The most common choices are sole proprietorships, 
general partnerships, limited partnerships, C corporations, S corporations, 
and limited liability companies (LLCs). Each has advantages and disadvan-
tages. Some forms are more restrictive than others, and, depending on your 
personal situation, some may have greater tax benefits. Hugh Daniels, a long-
time innkeeper and industry consultant (www.askhugh.com), advises his 
clients against sole proprietorships; although they are easy to set up, the lia-
bility and tax issues can be huge. Consult both your CPA or accountant and 
your lawyer to determine the legal structure that’s best for your business.
Making smart legal and tax moves
Decisions that you make as you’re setting up your business affect how your 
business is taxed while you own it and when you sell it. Seeking both legal 
and tax advice early in the process is important because your lawyer and 
accountant will help you address questions that you may not think to ask, 
such as:
 
✓ Should you separate the real estate from the business and have each 
owned by a different entity? If so, which entity should own the real 
estate portion of the business?
 
• Are there tax considerations if there are two forms of ownership, 
whereby one entity owns the real estate and rents it to the other 
entity, which owns and operates the business?
 
• What effect does this arrangement have on either entity’s legal 
exposure?
 
✓ Are there benefits of putting the real-estate portion of the business into 
a trust?
 
✓ If the business name is jointly owned, should the business be in both 
parties’ names?

40
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Consulting an inn consultant
You may decide to seek the advice of professionals to help you determine 
whether your plan is realistic and then help you put it in writing. (Even if you 
write your plan yourself, you may want to engage a consultant to help you 
review it.) Inn consultants can help in this respect; in fact, many of them have 
walked in your shoes as innkeepers themselves.
In addition to helping you put together your business plan, inn consultants 
can recommend accountants and lawyers or coach you on how to pick pro-
fessionals familiar with the issues that you’ll face as a B&B owner.
Table 3-1 lists the key industry consultants who can help you create a strong, 
clear plan for your business.

Brushing Up on Business Plan Basics
Creating a business plan is a step many small business owners, especially 
busy innkeepers, are tempted to skip over. Most business plans are created 
in order to secure financing, so while it’s not as much fun as picking out ame-
nities and planning menus, creating your plan is probably the most important 
thing you can do to ensure your B&B’s success. Without a good plan, you end 
up with chaos, and no business can succeed for long without clear direction. 
Your business will have a greater chance of success if you go through the 
exercise of setting your goals and analyzing your projections, your break-
even point, and your best- and worst-case scenarios.

41
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
 
If you decide to create your business plan on your own, there are many tem-
plates that you can use. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a 
wealth of information on its Web site (www.sba.gov). Also check out Business 
Plans Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Steven D. Peterson, PhD, Peter E. Jaret, 
and Barbara Findlay Schenck (also published by Wiley). But remember that 
your business plan should be unique to your B&B. So if you use a template, 
make sure that the person reading your plan can’t tell. By simply filling in the 
blanks, you’re unlikely to be able to adequately convey your passion and 
vision for your business and the research that should go into your plan.
Although it’s important to create a business plan that presents an organized 
look and feel and makes a good first impression, your focus should be on 
the planning process rather than the actual document itself. When you pres-
ent your plan, by all means, ensure that it is well laid out and professionally 
proofed. However, don’t spend valuable time on colors, graphs, and diagrams 
that could be better spent refining your data and assumptions.
Why you need a business plan
The main reasons to create a business plan are
 
✓ To create a road map for your business: Your business plan should 
chart the course and direction you think your business will take by 
clearly defining your business structure, goals, and projections.
 
✓ To secure financing: Done correctly, you can create a plan that will con-
vince a bank to loan you money.
 
✓ To evaluate your performance against your projections: Once you’re 
in business, your business plan serves as a tool to help you analyze 
whether you’re meeting, exceeding, or falling below your expectations.
The process of creating your business plan is an exercise that forces you 
to anticipate what may happen and set your goals and strategies accord-
ingly. When you write down your goals and refer to them often, you’re more 
assured of achieving them.
 
Your business plan is not just your proposal and request for financing; it’s 
also a commitment that you’re making to yourself, your family, any investors, 
and your business. Because all important commitments require time to con-
sider, writing a business plan requires a significant allocation of your time. 
Whether you seek outside advice from consultants or decide to create the 
plan yourself, you need to schedule time to do the proper research, gather 

42
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
documentation, and perform the analysis necessary to write a sound plan. 
Don’t underestimate this time commitment — keeping on track and meeting 
the deadlines that define your B&B purchase or startup is your responsibility.
And while you should be passionate about your business, don’t miss the 
opportunity to see flaws in your plan. If, during your research, you find that 
achieving the occupancy rate necessary to meet your goals is going to be 
difficult, stop and take a good, hard look at your motivation and the realistic 
prospects for your bed & breakfast. Think of the money, time, and aggrava-
tion you’ll save by using the planning process to discover major obstacles to 
the success of your business.
Looking at the parts of your plan
To give you an idea of the scope of a well-written business plan, the main sec-
tions should include
 
✓ A cover page that serves as an introduction to the plan and includes 
your contact information.
 
✓ A table of contents so those reading your plan can quickly find the spe-
cific information that’s of interest to them. Your table of contents says a 
lot about your plan — the more organized it appears, the better the first 
impression it makes on the reader. A comprehensive plan contains 20 or 
more pages, so organization is key.
 
✓ An executive summary that serves as an introduction to your bed & 
breakfast. This should be a comprehensive description of your business, 
including your vision and goals for your B&B as well as the services that 
you plan to offer. In defining the vision for your B&B, include the major 
features of your inn and how you intend to operate it. Also identify in 
detail what makes your bed & breakfast special and unique, and why 
someone would choose your inn over the competition.
 
✓ A company description outlining your corporate form and any partners 
involved in the business.
 
✓ A market analysis that outlines the strengths and weaknesses of any 
competitors in the area, who you expect your guests to be, the benefits 
of your location, and the niche your bed & breakfast will fill.
 
✓ A product and services analysis describing the types of accommoda-
tions and services your bed & breakfast will provide.

43
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
 
✓ A marketing plan that includes one of the following:
 
• For an existing inn: How you plan to fill your rooms and grow your 
business beyond the current level of occupancy.
 
• For a new inn: How you plan to bring guests to the inn.
 
✓ A funding request that outlines the financing you’re applying for if 
you’re using the plan as a loan request document.
 
✓ Financial statements that include such reports as budgeted income and 
cash flow statements, a break-even analysis, and one-, two- and three-
year forecasts of each report. This section should include supporting 
documents to back up your figures and forecasts. Use the example in 
Figure 3-1 for help in understanding how to forecast the figures you need 
to create these reports. Figure 3-2 shows you an example of how these 
figures are used to compile a budgeted income statement. When the 
plan is presented to a potential lender, you’ll also need to include per-
sonal tax returns and credit history information.
 
✓ Appendixes that can include more information about your background 
and your qualifications to run a successful B&B, as well as information 
about your lawyer, CPA or accountant, consultant, bank, and so forth.
 
For many years, lenders made loans based on projections of future cash flows. 
Today, however, they want hard facts and solid numbers before granting 
loans. Additionally, in the past, many bed & breakfasts were financed with res-
idential loans, whereas most new bed & breakfast loans must now go through 
the rigorous application process for a commercial loan. Thus, a good, solid 
business plan, backed up by historical performance numbers, is a necessity. 
(See Chapters 4 and 5 for more information on financing.)
A five-step plan for writing a business plan
Hilary Jones of Inngenium (www.inn
genium.com), who has written hundreds of 
business plans for bed & breakfasts, outlines 
five steps that can guide you toward the proper 
preparation crucial to your success as an 
innkeeper:
 1. Start early.
 2. Get organized.
 3. Dig deep with your research.
 4. Consider adversity.
 5. Back up all assumptions with credible 
sources.

Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Creating Your Financial Forecasts
All of your well-thought-out planning comes down to the numbers. The num-
bers you use in your forecasts are only as good as the research that goes into 
getting them. Without good, honest, up-to-date research, your forecasts and 
budget will be unrealistic.
Your finances are one of the primary areas that your banker looks at when 
determining your loan value, so they should be a major factor in all your 
decisions concerning your B&B. Spend time to get numbers you can trust for 
revenues, wages, operating expenses, marketing, renovations, insurance and 
licenses, start-up costs, legal and accounting expenses, and so forth.
 
If you don’t have a background in finance or accounting, it’s a good idea to 
prepare your forecasts with professional assistance.
Forecasting your revenue
Revenue is the money that you take in from all aspects of your business. 
Revenue is primarily generated by guests paying to stay in your rooms, but 
it can also come from selling items in a gift shop, hosting special events, and 
the like. The more room nights your inn is booked the higher your revenue 
will be, so the price of your rooms and how many nights they are occupied 
are used to calculate your revenue.
Estimating occupancy
According to the 2007-2008 PAII Industry Study of Operations and Finance, 
the average annual occupancy rate of participating inns was 43 percent. Your 
occupancy rate may vary significantly from this depending on many factors, 
such as location, amount of time in business, and whether the B&B has been 
marketed effectively in the past.
If you’re taking over an existing inn, in your first year of operation, you 
should forecast your occupancy rate monthly by looking back at the num-
bers from previous years and deciding what, if anything, you want to change 
to bring more guests to your business. Making projections on a monthly 
basis helps you to factor in the high- and low-season variables, as well as 
account for any local events and activities. Add up the monthly occupancy 
rates for the year, and then divide by 12 to estimate your first year’s aver-
age occupancy rate. If you’re starting your B&B from scratch, most experts 
advise taking no more than 50 percent of the average occupancy rate of simi-
lar, established properties in the area as a first-year estimate of occupancy. 

47
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
Others suggest estimating 10 to 15 percent as your total-year figure. Because 
there is no right answer and your situation and location are unique, do as 
much research as possible to get the most realistic evaluation. Here are some 
sources of data as well as trends and events to consider when creating your 
occupancy estimate:
 
✓ Historical occupancy, if you’re taking over an existing inn.
 
✓ Occupancy of other properties. Yours will be less if you’re a start-up 
business.
 
✓ Festivals and events that bring guests to the area. Look at your target 
market and determine dates that are important to those guests. For 
example, if you’re in or near a college town, check the dates that parents 
and students will be touring prospective colleges, settling new students 
in, and visiting for special events and graduations.
 
✓ Occupancy predictions from the chamber of commerce and/or the con-
vention and visitors bureau.
 
 Be careful about using published occupancy figures from these sources 
as your estimate if your location includes a number of large or chain 
hotels and motels. Occupancy rates of large lodging properties are com-
monly up to two times those of a small B&B in the same area. These fig-
ures can therefore skew your projections and give you an overly 
optimistic view.
 
✓ Seasonal patterns. Determine the time of year guests are most likely to 
visit (high season) and when it’s most likely to be quiet (low season) 
and estimate your occupancy accordingly.
 
✓ Economic predictions. You can’t ignore what’s going on around you. 
If the economy is heading into a downturn, expect occupancy rates to 
decline from the same period last year. If the economy is on an upturn, 
you should be more optimistic, but realistic, in your occupancy estimates.
Calculating your revenue
To be successful, you’ll need a steady stream of revenue and guests flowing 
through your inn, and the two are directly related to each other. In order to 
estimate your revenue, you need
 
✓ Your estimated occupancy rate (calculated above)
 
✓ The number of rooms you have available for rent
 
✓ The number of days you’re open each month
 
✓ Your room rates (see Chapter 7 for help in calculating your room rates)

48
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Your estimated revenue is the product of these four figures. For example, the 
inn in Figure 3-1 estimated their revenue in January as follows:
Estimated occupancy rate
25%
Number of rooms available
5
Number of days in January
31
Actual room rate
$150
.25 × 5 × 31 × 150 = January revenue of $5,812.50 (rounded up to 
$5,813.00)
Including other revenue
In the beginning, it’s best to focus on your core business — filling your guest 
rooms. You may, however, be purchasing an existing inn that hosts bridal 
showers, corporate events, or weddings, and/or has a gift shop. In this case, 
add the expected revenue from each income producer to your total revenue 
calculations. (Once your business is established, see Chapter 17 for informa-
tion on increasing revenue by adding services and a gift shop.)
Projecting costs and expenses
When projecting your costs and expenses, you’ll break them down into three 
categories: organizational costs (sometimes called start-up costs), capital 
expenditures, and operating expenses:
 
✓ Organizational costs are those expenses that you incur while getting 
ready to open your doors for business. These expenditures are accounted 
for on your balance sheet and are amortized over at least five years. They 
include
 
• Legal fees in setting up your business
 
• Registration/filing fees
 
• Accounting fees to set up your accounting system
 
• Expenses in investigating the industry and business, such as con-
ventions and training
 
• Consultant expenses prior to opening
 
• Most expenses incurred prior to opening that are not capital or 
operating expenses
 
✓ Capital expenditures are those items that generally have a life of greater 
than one year and a value of over $1,000, though the definition can be 
adjusted depending on your circumstances. These also are accounted 

49
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
for on your balance sheet and are depreciated over the life of the asset. 
These items may include your building, furniture, towels and linens, 
appliances, renovations, fixtures, and equipment.
 
✓ Operating expenses are the ongoing expenses that include everything 
you use to produce income, such as food, supplies, wages, utilities, 
insurance, advertising, memberships, and so forth.
 
Because it’s assumed you’ll have greater expenses in your first year due to the 
costs of getting your bed & breakfast off the ground, your financial plan 
should contain projections for at least three years.
 
It generally takes about three years to get enough historical information to be 
able to accurately forecast expenses and revenues.
This area can be confusing and technical, which is exactly why you need a 
competent CPA or accountant and/or consultant.
It takes money to make money, and there is no way to avoid the operating 
(ongoing) expenses necessary to run your B&B. In order to predict when your 
business will reach the break-even point and then be profitable, you must 
estimate all your expenses and then subtract them from the revenue that you 
expect your business to generate (which you forecasted earlier in this chap-
ter). The next sections help you to create forecasts for the biggest and most 
common operating expenses associated with running a bed & breakfast.
Creating a schedule of payments
Your business will have expected and unexpected expenses. Creating a 
spreadsheet of known, recurring expenses will help you estimate your finan-
cial obligations on a monthly basis.
There are three types of expenses: fixed, variable, and discretionary. 
Sometimes an expense is a little of two, sometimes it falls into all three. Some 
payments, such as your mortgage and taxes, don’t change during your busy 
season, whereas others, like your utility payments, probably do. For example, 
the more guests you entertain at your inn, the higher your utility bill is likely 
to be. In this case, you can expect the higher revenue coming in (as a result 
of greater occupancy) to cover the added expense. However, your mortgage 
and taxes must be paid even during the off-season or when your inn is closed. 
(Mortgages that have seasonal payments are the exception, and some states 
treat tax payments similarly.) Having a schedule from which you budget 
expenses helps your business run smoothly during all seasons.
Create a list of your expected expenses and estimated payments, broken 
down by month, such as those shown earlier in Figure 3-1. If you’re using 
accounting software, which I highly recommend, you can set up your budget 
figures for the year and the software will then calculate the monthly esti-
mates automatically. When you’re finally up and running, the software will 
also do actual versus budget comparisons for you.

Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Forecasting food and amenities expenses
Creating a luxurious guest experience is the goal of most innkeepers, but at 
what cost? Champagne and caviar are great only if your room rates support 
the cost of providing them and still allow you to be profitable. Figure out, 
then, what amenities you can offer within the price of your rooms.
Knowing what other B&Bs in the area offer from an amenity standpoint is a 
good place to start. Next, draw up a list of the amenities you plan to offer, 
including both food and non-food items, and then figure out what it will cost 
you to provide these amenities. (It’s important to note that some people 
define amenities as disposables, such as shampoo, soap, and so on, while 
others define amenities as encompassing everything that they provide, 
including concierge services, breakfasts, flat panel TVs, jetted tubs, fire-
places, and so forth. You may want to break down your expenses in terms of 
disposable items versus services, but to keep things simpler, I use the term 
to discuss both here). This part of the process requires planning, research, 
and some estimation on your part.
Calculating food costs begins by breaking down the cost of what you plan to 
serve on a per-person basis. As you get busier, this is an exercise you may 
not have time for and you may use your weekly grocery bill for budgeting, 
but in the beginning, it’s a good exercise to get an idea of your true costs:
 
1. Start by creating several typical sample breakfast menus. 
 
 List all ingredients required to prepare the meal.
 
2. Calculate the cost of the ingredients to prepare each recipe. 
 
 For staples such as flour, sugar, salt, and so forth that you may have 
on hand, divide the price of the package size by the amount you use. 
For example, if you need 1 cup of flour to make a batch of muffins that 
serves 12, your calculations for the flour are
 
 $ price of 5-lb bag of flour ÷ 24 (5 pounds of flour = 24 cups)
 
3. Add up the cost of the ingredients for each recipe, and divide it by the 
serving size. 
 
 You now have the approximate cost per serving for each item on your 
sample menu.
 
4. Add up the cost per serving for each item on your sample menu. 
 
 This allows you to calculate the approximate cost per person for each 
sample menu.
 
 Each person won’t necessarily eat one serving, a factor you need to take 
into consideration when calculating your menu costs. For buffet-style 
breakfasts, calculate the number of servings you anticipate each guest 

51
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
eating (more food is wasted with buffet breakfasts), and for plated 
breakfasts, don’t forget to take into account that some guests may ask 
for seconds. Once you’ve adjusted the number of servings you need to 
accommodate these estimates, you can more accurately determine the 
anticipated cost per guest for each recipe.
 
5. For other complimentary food services, such as welcome drinks, after-
noon tea, cookies, snacks, and so on, you need to start with your best 
guess of what guests will consume. 
 
 Other innkeepers may be willing to share their experiences with you for 
budgeting purposes. As you begin welcoming guests, keep track of the 
complimentary food and beverages consumed and the number of guests 
served. These figures will help you calculate the average cost of compli-
mentary items on a per-guest basis, allowing you to eliminate some of 
the guesswork in your second-year projections.
 
Your food expenses per guest will be less when you have a full house than 
when you have only a couple of guests. This is because serving a smaller 
number of people always generates more waste. With many recipes, you can 
reduce the number of servings by only so much: For example, you can’t use 
half an egg. So if the smallest number of muffins you can make is 6 (using one 
egg) but only three muffins are consumed by guests, you have three that must 
be disposed of. Your cost per muffin, therefore, doubles in these instances, to 
account for the fact that three out of the six are wasted.
 
Creating menus with the same approximate total cost is helpful for budgeting 
and pricing your rooms. Knowing the approximate cost of a variety of your 
favorite recipes helps you mix and match items to create menus that you will 
be pleased and proud to serve.
To forecast your expenses for non-food amenities, start by making a list of 
the items that you plan to provide to each guest, such as shampoo, condi-
tioner, soap, lotion, turn-down chocolates or mints, and flowers in the room.
If you plan to use an amenities dispenser, calculate the cost divided by the 
number of nights you think it will take guests to use up your supply. This 
is another calculation you’ll be able to forecast better in your second year 
of operation, if you keep track of guests’ actual use. For individual bottles 
of shampoo, lotion, and conditioner, and bars of soap, calculate how much 
each one costs. For purposes of initial forecasting, budget for one of each for 
each room per night. Although you’ll find that, in practice, most two-night 
stays only require one bottle of each amenity, you may get guests who ask 
for more. If your inn will be attracting high-end guests, consider purchasing 
larger, 2-ounce bottles rather than standard 1- or 11/2-ounce bottles.

52
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Adding advertising expenses
Your advertising costs will probably be highest in the first three years of 
your business because this is the average number of years it takes to achieve 
the same occupancy as your competition. Additionally, you need to budget 
for creating or updating your Web site. (See Chapter 8 for information on 
creating a Web site and utilizing various types of advertising.) How much you 
budget for advertising depends on a variety of factors. Costs are highest for 
those who are opening a new bed & breakfast, buying an existing B&B that 
doesn’t have a strong Internet presence, or purchasing a distressed inn that 
needs lots of help. No matter what, it takes advertising to bring guests to 
your inn, so don’t skimp on this expense.
 
Don’t make the mistake of cutting back on your advertising after you’re estab-
lished because this can be disastrous. Also consider that the Web is ever-
changing and that new technologies (such as Web 3.0) will show up 
eventually!
Budgeting for room & housekeeping supplies
Everything from cleaning supplies to toilet paper to light bulbs can land in this 
category. Bed & breakfasts are so diverse that this number may vary greatly. 
The PAII Industry Study of Operations and Finance suggests that, depending 
on the size and location of your inn, the cost of room and housekeeping sup-
plies should run between 11/2 and 21/2 percent of your estimated revenues.
Anticipating staffing costs
If you have partners involved in the business, you need to divide up job 
responsibilities early in the planning process and then determine what you can 
and will outsource. Not only does this prevent misunderstandings, but it also 
helps you to analyze the talent already on your team. Having a real strength in 
one area doesn’t make up for deficiencies in other areas. For example, having 
two partners with a strong background in marketing doesn’t make up for the 
fact that no one on the team has any bookkeeping or accounting experience.
To determine partnership roles and how to divvy up the responsibilities, 
or to determine which tasks require outside help, begin by making a list of 
the areas that need to be covered at your inn. Then decide who should be 
responsible for each of them. If this is a family business, everyone involved 
needs to be consulted. Your list may look something like this:
 
✓ Bookkeeping: Banking, bill paying, payroll
 
✓ Food Service: Breakfast and menu preparation, shopping, baking
 
✓ Marketing: Managing advertising, creating brochures, handling Web site
 
✓ Housekeeping: Cleaning guest rooms, common areas, and bathrooms; 
trash removal; laundry; and so on

53
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
 
✓ Gardening: Maintaining yard and gardens
 
✓ Guest Services: Taking reservations, greeting guests, handling guest 
requests, answering the phone, returning phone calls and e-mails
 
✓ Maintenance: Basic upkeep, preventative maintenance, snow removal
You may find that some areas can be split up, with some tasks handled 
by someone at the inn while others are outsourced. For example, as the 
innkeeper, you could pay bills and do the banking, but payroll could be 
outsourced.
While innkeepers do the majority of the work at the inn themselves, hiring 
some form of outside help is an eventual reality for most (see Chapter 14 for 
information on getting extra help when you need it). Calculating staffing costs 
helps you to determine how much assistance you can afford.
First, make a list of jobs that you plan to outsource or hire additional help 
for. The larger your B&B, the more people you’ll need to have on your team. 
Participants in the PAII Industry Study of Operations and Finance employed 
an average of 4.3 employees, including full-time, part-time, hourly, and sala-
ried personnel. Larger inns and those with higher rates had more employees 
than average, while inns with one to four rooms typically had fewer than two 
employees. When assembling your team, decide whether you’re going to 
hire an innkeeper, assistant innkeeper, cook, housekeeper, bookkeeper, gar-
dener, maintenance person, and so on, and outline it in your plan. Note that 
despite the number of inns that do employ staff, 58 percent of innkeepers in 
the study also worked outside of the inn and relied on additional sources of 
income in addition to innkeeping.
Next, calculate and record the estimated wages for these employees, includ-
ing any associated or required payroll costs, such as the employer’s portion 
of FICA (Medicare and Social Security), unemployment, disability, workers 
compensation, and other taxes your state or city may require you to with-
hold. For help in calculating base wages, look at classified ads to see what 
similar jobs are paying (not just jobs at B&Bs, but in the lodging industry in 
general) or consult other innkeepers in local associations and on innkeeper 
forums (see Chapter 1 for info on benefitting from other innkeepers).
 
Workers compensation insurance is generally expensive. Whether or not you 
offer benefits to your employees, this is a requirement that you must budget 
for, even if you only employ one part-timer.
Making insurance part of your business plan
When you insure your bed & breakfast, you want to be certain that both your 
home and your business are covered in the event of loss, damage, or injury. 
For most, it’s not a question of whether you’ll need to file a claim, but when, 
so having good coverage from the start is essential to protect yourself, your 

54
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
investment, and your business. Note that a homeowners’ policy doesn’t 
cover your business, and a straight business policy doesn’t cover you per-
sonally, so look for a specialized policy that covers both.
Your insurance policy will be broken into two main areas: property (the 
building and its contents) and causality (also known as liability). Because 
many different types of coverage are available, it’s a good idea to find an 
insurance agent with experience in the lodging industry to help you deter-
mine what coverage you need. Once you have a good idea, shop for the most 
competitive price by comparing the features of several policies.
Asking other innkeepers is a good way to begin your search for an insurance 
carrier. (See Chapter 1 for help in finding innkeeper resources.) PAII also 
maintains a list of insurance carriers that serve the bed & breakfast indus-
try. Go to www.paii.org, click on Resources, and then click on Vendor 
Marketplace. Use this list as a starting point for comparing recommended 
coverage and rates, and then check references with other innkeepers. You 
may be able to find a local carrier who can serve your needs, but remember 
that typical homeowners’ insurance won’t provide the protection you need.
 
Shop around. It isn’t possible for one broker to obtain quotes from every com-
pany. Some companies only sell through their own agents. Some brokers have 
more clout with different insurance companies, so you could get two different 
quotes from the same company from two different brokers!
 
Request any clarifications you have about coverage in writing from the carrier, 
not the broker or agent.
Including other expenses
You’ll have a variety of other expenses, both expected and unexpected. 
Review the expense section of your chart of accounts (Chapter 6 helps 
you set up your chart of accounts, and Table 6-1 shows a sample chart of 
accounts for a bed & breakfast) and budget for each line item.
Making the numbers work
If you’ve worked through this chapter, you’ve calculated, estimated, and 
researched the numbers. Don’t cut corners. With the help of your accoun-
tant or inn consultant or on your own, create an estimated monthly forecast 
(refer to Figure 3-1) and use it to create a budgeted income statement (refer 
to Figure 3-2). Keep in mind that net income does not represent the cash 
flow generated by your inn. Your accountant or inn consultant can help you 

55
 Chapter 3: Creating the Plan for Your Business 
understand how this works, but you can estimate your cash flows by adjust-
ing your net income for noncash expenses (like depreciation and amortiza-
tion) and other cash expenditures (like capital expenditures and principal 
payments on your mortgage).
Now take time to review your business plan and — no matter how excited 
you are about your new business — ask yourself seriously: Do the numbers 
work? Do they make sense? Combine your conclusions with your personal 
goals, remembering to consider:
 
✓ How long do you estimate it will take for your business to break even? 
Can you live with this time frame?
 
✓ Will you need an outside income to make your business plan work? If 
so, have you considered what would happen if you lost this job or if this 
additional income was greatly reduced for some reason?
 
✓ How much do you have saved for the unexpected?
 
✓ How much of these savings are you willing to invest in the business?
If your break-even projected timeline isn’t what you anticipated, it’s better to 
know now in the planning stage, when you can make changes or even aban-
don your plans for this business. In any event, you should plan to put aside 6 
to12 months’ worth of money to cover operating expenses and debt service 
for your first year. This is called working capital and if you’re applying for a 
loan, the bank will want to see that you’ve accounted for it.

process. At times, you may become frustrated in your search for the inn of 
your dreams — or simply one that you can afford. Or you may find the per-
fect inn and then discover that the costs of bringing it up to code or making 
major repairs mean you have to scratch it off your list. The good news is that 
this chapter prepares you for all possible scenarios by telling you what to 
look for when searching for the bed & breakfast that you’ll ultimately pour 
your love, sweat, and tears into.
In this chapter, I help you to find your inn by showing you where to look. 
Then I take you through the process of making an offer, conducting your due 
diligence, and getting ready for opening day!
Weighing the Pros and Cons 
of Buying an Existing Inn
Buying and taking over an existing inn, building your own inn, or converting 
a property into a bed & breakfast each has a unique set of advantages, draw-
backs, and challenges. Like many innkeepers, you may find that the advan-
tages of buying an existing bed & breakfast far outweigh the disadvantages. 
Being informed and evaluating the tradeoffs will help you determine whether 
buying an existing inn is the right choice for you. Following are some pros 
and cons:

58
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
✓ Existing business records to evaluate: An existing inn that has been 
run professionally as a business should have financial records that will 
help you determine your future at that B&B. (For a brand new inn, you 
have to rely solely on your projections.) You shouldn’t expect a seller 
to divulge all the records and financial information in the early stages of 
negotiations. Asking questions about occupancy rate, average daily rate, 
and the types of guests that the inn caters to will give you a preliminary 
idea about the business. When you get to the point where you’re seen 
as a serious buyer, have qualified as such with the seller’s broker (see 
more on this later in this chapter), and are proceeding with the pur-
chase of the property, you’ll have the benefit of seeing the actual num-
bers for the current revenue and expenses of the business.
 
 Engaging an inn consultant or inn broker familiar with the bed & break-
fast industry early in your search not only helps you to move the entire 
process along but also helps you get and interpret the information you 
need during the purchase process. (Chapter 3 tells you how to find an 
inn consultant, and Table 4-1 later in this chapter directs you in finding 
an inn broker.)
 
✓ Having furnishings in place: When you buy an existing bed & breakfast, 
you may be buying a turnkey operation, meaning the furnishings and 
equipment necessary to run the inn are already in place. Keep in mind, 
however, that an owner rarely leaves absolutely everything that you 
see when you walk in the door. What’s turnkey to one seller may not be 
turnkey to another. During negotiations, ask for a list of items that will 
be removed from the inn (see information on inclusion and exclusion 
lists later in this chapter, in the “Outlining basic terms” section).
 
✓ Living with someone else’s decorating style: You may find an existing 
B&B that makes sense from a business point of view and fits into your 
business plan, but you may not like how it’s decorated or currently laid 
out. This isn’t a serious issue if the drawbacks are cosmetic and you can 
live with them for a while, but you should factor the cost of redecorating 
and/or major renovations into your business plan.
 
 If you really don’t like the look and feel of the inn, even if it fits many of 
your other criteria such as location, price, current cash flow, and so on, 
stop and seriously consider looking for another property that you can 
be excited about. Remember, you have to live and work there, probably 
for several years or more!
 
✓ Hosting guests immediately: When you buy an existing inn, you don’t 
have to wait for advertising to kick in for guests to find you. There even 
may be some future reservations already on the books, depending on 
how the business was run previously. As you move through the purchase 
process, you can evaluate the value of the established business based on 
the current revenue stream and expenses. The value to you of buying that 
business will vary depending on these numbers, as well as on whether the 
business is attracting the type of guests that you intend to cater to.

59
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
 
 For example, if the inn specializes in romantic getaways and your plan 
is to target business travelers and host business meetings, you have to 
work harder than if the inn already caters to this type of guest. You need 
to create a timeline for the transition. As you gear up for new guests, 
you wind down and honor reservations from existing guests. You need 
to provide for both. Your breakfast hours may be longer because busi-
ness travelers usually want early breakfast times, whereas those enjoy-
ing a getaway like to sleep in. Your rooms need to offer the amenities for 
both groups — the inn may already have hot tubs, but you may need to 
add desks and wireless Internet. You have to ramp up your advertising 
to target your new group of guests.
 
 At the end of the day, you have a lot of room nights to fill and it may 
not be a good idea to make a complete change immediately. My advice: 
Don’t try and fix what’s not broken. Look at the value of the inn’s exist-
ing business and see how you can enhance it, paying attention to who 
your weekend guests will be and who your mid-week guests will be.
 
✓ Having zoning, licenses, and permits in place: Generally speaking, 
when you purchase an existing bed & breakfast, most zoning, licenses, 
and permits are in place and the legal issues have been handled. (Check 
out the “Verifying zoning, permits, and codes” section later in this chap-
ter for important considerations in this area.)
 
 If permits and licenses are in a sole proprietor’s name and not in the 
name of the business, you have to change them when you purchase the 
inn. This process may prove time-consuming and/or costly.
Finding Inns for Sale
The decisions that you make to find and buy a bed & breakfast to call both 
home and work are exciting, important, difficult, and confusing. If you’ve 
identified and done your research on the type of B&B you want to run and 
you’ve found a geographical location that makes sense (see Chapter 2 for 
help in these areas), the next step is to find the specific property that fits 
your business model.
Keep your business brain and your emotions separate. Yes, you need to find a 
location and a property that you’re passionate about, but you also need to find 
a property that meets your business expectations and not be tempted to change 
those expectations and your business model to fit the property. If you do, you 
could end up living in a beautiful property only temporarily because you won’t 
be able to support it if you don’t have enough guests to fill your rooms.
Bed & breakfast buyers and sellers meet in a variety of places, from con-
ferences to coffee shops to the Internet to the inns themselves. As an inn 
buyer, your concern is finding an inn that fits your business model and plan. 
Fortunately for you, there are many ways and places to find inns for sale.

60
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Doing the legwork yourself
Many of the best inns sell without ever officially being for sale, according to Bill 
Oates of Inn Consulting Partners (www.innpartners.com). He advises clients 
to look at every inn (both those for sale and those not for sale) in a market-
place that fits their business model and eliminate the ones that don’t. Narrow 
the list down to six inns that fit your profile, and stay at each one as a guest.
While you’re staying at an inn, discreetly let the current innkeepers know 
that you’re an aspiring innkeeper and interested in owning an inn somewhat 
like theirs. This should be a friendly, informal conversation, but one that 
you’ve thought through ahead of time. Tread carefully: If the innkeepers 
aren’t interested in selling, they may end up being your new neighbors (and 
competition!), so you don’t want to establish a bad impression. Also, the 
innkeepers usually know which inns in the area or region are for sale and can 
help direct your search. If you find out that the innkeepers may be interested 
in selling, arrange to have a professional inn consultant perform an evalua-
tion of the property and construct a financial packet. (See the next section 
for information on inn consultants.)
Even if you don’t find your B&B through this research method, you haven’t 
wasted time or money because you should stay in many of the inns in the 
area that you’re considering for your bed & breakfast. This practice helps 
you get to know the area, find out what other inns are offering, and establish 
relationships with other innkeepers.
The Internet is an excellent place to find inns for sale; numerous Web sites are 
devoted to listing them. Here are some suggestions on where to turn online:
 
✓ Internet search engine: Perform an Internet search for “bed breakfast 
for sale [desired location],” filling in the state or region you’ve identified 
in your business model for the location of your inn. For example, “bed 
breakfast for sale California” produces a list of sites offering inns for sale 
in California.
 
✓ Associations: Check the Web sites of state and local bed & breakfast 
associations in your preferred area for listings of inns for sale. For 
an example, see the Indiana Bed & Breakfast Association Web site, 
(www.Indianabedandbreakfast.org), which has links to inns for 
sale at the top and bottom of the right side of their home page. The 
Professional Association of Innkeepers International (www.paii.org) is 
also a great association resource for listings.
 
✓ Online directories: Several leading online directories, such as www.
bbonline.com and www.bnbfinder.com, devote sections of their 
Web sites to listings of inns for sale. (You can find a more complete list 
of popular directories in Chapter 8.)

 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
Consulting an inn broker, inn consultant, 
or real estate agent
Wondering what the difference is between an inn broker, an inn consultant, 
and a real estate agent? Inn brokers and inn consultants have an in-depth 
understanding of the uniqueness of the bed & breakfast industry. Each can 
work to protect either the buyer or the seller and be the facilitator to ensure 
a good deal reaches successful completion.
Because so much specialized knowledge is necessary for the proper handling 
of the purchase or sale of a bed & breakfast, many inn brokers also offer inn 
consulting services. But not all inn consultants are brokers in that they’re not 
licensed to sell real estate and therefore don’t represent any inns for sale. 
However, consultants often specialize in other areas, such as business plan-
ning, and can be a good resource to help you plan for and find your inn, and 
advise you on decisions regarding a purchase, particularly if there’s no inn 
broker in your area and if your accountant, lawyer, and real estate agent are 
unfamiliar with the bed & breakfast industry.
Real estate agents sell real estate. Some are knowledgeable about commer-
cial transactions, and some aren’t. Many innkeepers who are ready to sell 
their B&Bs list with local real estate agents who may not have handled the 
purchase or sale of a B&B. And that inexperience means that there are some 
serious downsides to using a real estate agent for a B&B sale or purchase. 
For example, a real estate agent who doesn’t specialize in B&B transactions 
is unlikely to be able to review an inn’s books, records, and income tax 
returns in order to put together an overview evaluation of the business for 
you. Here’s another example: Residential real-estate agents may not have any 
experience selling turnkey operations and so may not know the importance 
of creating inclusion and exclusion lists early in the process. Also, residential 
real-estate agents often aren’t familiar with commercial mortgages, which are 
the most common financing method behind the sale of a bed & breakfast. For 
these reasons I strongly encourage you to consult an industry professional 
during your search process. (Start with the inn consultants in Chapter 3 or 
the inn brokers in Table 4-1).
Table 4-1 presents some of the better-known companies offering listings of 
bed & breakfasts for sale; some of these companies also offer inn consult-
ing services. An industry professional can guide you through the process 
and make up for a local agent’s inexperience in inn sales. Chapter 3 helps 
you find an inn consultant. To find additional professionals with knowl-
edge of inn sales, visit PAII’s Vendor Marketplace at www.paii.org. Look 
under Resources, click on Vendor Marketplace, and then click on Appraisal/
Valuation/Real Estate Agent or Accounting/Bookkeeping/Consulting/Legal.

Being seen as a serious buyer
Plenty of folks explore the dream of owning a bed & breakfast. Before sell-
ers get their hopes up that you’re their buyer, and before they share sensi-
tive financial information with you, they want to know that you’re a serious 
buyer. By reading this book, you’re on your way to proving you’re serious 
because you’re taking the time to understand what it takes to run a bed & 
breakfast. However, some other signs are just as important when approach-
ing a seller or broker. Consider the following recommendations:
 
✓ Have at least 20 percent in cash for a down payment, plus additional 
money for operating funds.
 
✓ Have a model for your business. (Review Chapter 3 for help in building 
the model for your business.)
 
✓ Assemble your team of inn broker, inn consultant, accountant, and 
lawyer. (See Chapter 3 for help in finding these experts and developing a 
business plan.)

63
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
 
✓ Join innkeeper associations and attend their aspiring innkeeper work-
shops and conferences. All associations welcome aspiring innkeepers 
and are anxious to help you. You will miss out on valuable resources by 
waiting to own an inn before joining B&B associations. (Chapter 16 has 
information on professional innkeepers’ associations.)
 
✓ Take a class for aspiring innkeepers. (See Chapter 1 for help in finding 
innkeeper training.)
 
✓ Work or volunteer at a bed & breakfast to gain experience.
Deciding What to Offer
When you find inns that you’re interested in, how do you figure out what the 
inn, its property, and its potential are worth? How much should you pay? 
Deciding the value of almost anything is a tough job, and as you’ve probably 
realized, given the uniqueness of the bed & breakfast industry and each B&B, 
figuring out what to offer for an existing inn can be even tougher. Naturally 
you have to keep in mind the asking price when making an offer, and then 
negotiations go back and forth because of the many complex considerations 
to be made, until hopefully you and the seller reach a compromise. Of course, 
you want to buy the inn at the lowest price possible, and the seller wants to 
receive the highest price possible. Here are some variables to help you for-
mulate an offer that makes sense to you and satisfies everyone:
 
✓ Cash flow: With 20 percent down, does the anticipated cash flow, which 
is based on your projections by analyzing the inn’s current cash flow and 
your realistic expectations of future cash flow, cover the debt service — 
your mortgage payment? Ideally, the property should generate a cash flow 
of about 120 percent of the debt service after covering all other expenses. 
So your net income before you’ve paid your mortgage needs to be at least 
1.2 times the debt payments. For example, if your mortgage payments for 
the year total $50,000, you should expect the property to have a cash flow 
of at least $60,000, after operating expenses.
 
✓ Down payment: You shouldn’t buy what you can’t afford. When making 
offers, look for properties for which you can afford to put up a minimum 
of 20 percent as a down payment.
 
✓ Other calculations, such as price per square foot, price per room, 
return on investment, capital rate, and gross rent multiplier: These 
calculations are all useful tools but complicated to calculate and inter-
pret and not infallible. A good inn consultant can help you with them.

64
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Determining the value of the property
The value of the property is determined by the value of the real estate plus 
the value of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and/or by how the business 
itself is doing.
The same features that make the property appealing to you as a buyer also 
make it more valuable to you someday when you’re the seller. Some of the 
characteristics that add value to a bed & breakfast property are
 
✓ Private baths
 
✓ Up-to-date zoning and permits
 
✓ Modern, heavy-duty appliances
 
✓ In-room fireplaces
 
✓ Whirlpool tubs
 
✓ Curb appeal (including landscaping and the building exterior)
 
✓ Location
 
✓ Large rooms
 
✓ Large, comfortable innkeeper’s quarters
 
✓ Status as inspected and accepted by various accreditation organizations 
(Select Registry, AAA Diamond awards, Canada Select, and so on)
 
✓ Expansion capabilities (including available space and friendly zoning laws)
If the historical numbers (revenue and expenses) don’t seem to justify the 
purchase price, you need to pull back and seriously consider whether oppor-
tunities exist to increase the numbers. If the answer’s yes, are they realistic? 
Don’t let your excitement for the property get in the way of a smart decision. 
Low numbers could be a loud and clear warning sign that running the prop-
erty as a B&B is not a good investment and one that you should steer clear 
of. Conversely, low numbers could mean that something has occurred in the 
current operation of the inn that has kept the numbers low, giving you an 
opportunity for growth.
Here are some ways to evaluate the future potential of an inn:
 
✓ Look at the competition. Compare this inn to other similar inns in the 
area, and answer these questions:
 
• Are the rooms priced too high or too low in comparison? 
Remember that when prices are set too high, guests may choose 
other properties. When they’re set too low, not only is potential 
revenue lost, but also guests may think that the property is inferior 
and therefore choose other accommodations. Refer to Chapter 7 
for information on setting prices.

65
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
 
• Do other properties have similar occupancy rates? Is it located 
in an area that guests visit, and does the area have activities to 
attract guests? Refer to Chapter 2 for help in determining whether 
the area will draw the number and type of guests that your busi-
ness plan requires.
 
✓ Critique the inn layout and furnishings. Do all rooms have private, 
attached baths? Are the room appointments worn or outdated? Would 
you see a significant increase in revenues if you were to remodel one or 
more of the bathrooms or redecorate and refurbish guest rooms?
 
 It’s natural to think that you can do better, so be cautious about paying 
a premium for potential. Use care and good calculations when evaluat-
ing how much future investment and effort are needed in an existing 
property to bring the numbers up.
 
✓ Review the marketing and publicity history of the inn. Does the inn 
have a good Web site and a strong Internet presence? Is there a strong 
advertising campaign in place? (Refer to Chapters 8 and 15 to evaluate 
potential marketing strategies that you could implement.) You may be 
looking at a real opportunity if the current innkeepers haven’t utilized 
every marketing and publicity opportunity to develop their business.
 
✓ Determine the inn’s reputation. Type the name of the inn into your favor-
ite Internet search engine and find out what guests are saying about the 
inn. Their reviews may be keeping potential guests away. These reviews 
give you a lot of information about what’s wrong with the property and a 
clear picture of what needs to change in order to increase numbers.
 
 Note: Some Web sites remove negative reviews for an inn when the 
ownership changes, something you should aggressively pursue if you 
become the owner. If negative reviews can’t be removed, when you are 
the owner, see whether you can post a management response letting 
potential guests know that ownership has changed and telling them how 
you plan to address the problems that caused the negative review. Then 
provide outstanding service, and great reviews will come.
 
 If the inn has a bad reputation in the neighborhood, you will need to 
work hard to change the perception local businesses and residents have 
of your inn. Here is another opportunity to increase business because 
locals can be a great source of referrals, so start by hosting a fabulous 
open house (Chapter 5 contains some great recommendations on this).
 
✓ Analyze the current target market, if there is one. How could you repo-
sition the inn and improve its visibility?
 
✓ Consider family or personal issues of the previous owners. Have family 
or personal problems impeded the progress of the inn?
The answers to these questions will help you understand why an inn may not 
be operating at peak performance. Use this information to decide whether 
you’ve found a property that fits into the model and plan that you have set 
for your business.

66
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Verifying zoning, permits, and codes
Just because you’re buying an existing inn, don’t assume that all the inn’s 
zoning, permits, and codes are up-to-date. Oftentimes, existing inns have 
been grandfathered in for changes in codes and ordinances, but these exemp-
tions may or may not carry over to you as a new owner, including require-
ments for guests with special needs (see Chapter 5 for more information). 
Sometimes, because the current innkeepers are well-known in the town, 
inspectors have looked the other way on issues that may be enforced now 
that the inn is under new ownership. Additionally, simply the change in own-
ership prompts inspectors, who may not have been making regular inspec-
tions, to pay a visit.
When it comes to zoning, permits, and codes, the more you know, the better. 
You need to either contact or meet with governing officials and agencies 
including, but not limited to, the
 
✓ Building and planning department (often through your local city hall or 
county building department in unincorporated areas)
 
✓ Fire department
 
✓ Health department
Ask to see the inspection files on the existing B&B so that you can view the 
inspectors’ reports. Hiding from inspectors and regulations is a bad idea, and 
I strongly advise against it. To do so could put you out of business. The time 
to know the right way to do things is before you own the bed & breakfast, 
when you can factor in or negotiate any costs necessary to bring the prop-
erty up to code and comply with regulations. Being current on federal, state, 
and local licenses, permits, codes, and regulations is not only required to do 
business and to keep your insurance in force, but it’s also the way to keep 
your inn current on safety issues, making guests’ stays at your inn safer.
In most areas, the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) transfers between owners, 
but you should verify that this is the case for an existing inn you’re interested 
in purchasing. Insist on an inspection by the fire, health, and zoning authori-
ties as a contingency of escrow so you know of issues that need correcting 
and can budget for them accordingly. If an on-site inspection by these agen-
cies isn’t possible as a contingency, you should still meet with the agencies 
specifically about the property you’re buying to get their input. You want to 
know ahead of time about any renovations or changes that need to be made 
to be sure you’re complying with all zoning and code requirements. After you 
own the inn, get to know these inspectors by inviting them over. They can 
educate you and help you stay up-to-date on codes and safety requirements. 
Some innkeepers know the inspectors so well that they visit more than neces-
sary because of the delicious treats the innkeepers serve at each visit!

67
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
Regulations, local ordinances, and zoning requirements may prevent you from 
executing some of the plans that you envision. Carefully compare the existing 
use of properties you’re considering with the uses you’ve incorporated into 
your business plan. For example, suppose that you anticipate hosting wed-
dings at your bed & breakfast to bring in additional revenue. After looking 
at many inns, you’re very excited about one in particular — it has beautiful 
architecture, beautiful gardens, and five guest rooms. The owners reside at 
the inn but don’t rent the inn other than to lodging guests. For you to buy this 
inn and host weddings sounds easy enough, but consider that your intended 
use changes the current use of the property, which in all likelihood is fully 
permitted as it exists. In most areas, hosting even an occasional wedding 
requires special permits and zoning variances as well as renovations, such as 
additional parking and restroom facilities. (See Chapter 17 for additional infor-
mation on codes and variances when adding additional services.)
Consider zoning ordinances and regulations in regards to expanding your 
business. Adding extra rooms or a gift shop may be the farthest thing from 
your mind right now, but knowing whether they’re even a possibility under 
current zoning is smart business planning and can add value to the property.
Evaluating the added value of goodwill
Goodwill is an intangible asset from an accounting point of view. However, 
when buying an existing bed & breakfast, the business’s reputation must be 
factored in because goodwill adds value. The easiest way to see the value of 
goodwill is through
 
✓ Repeat business: Returning guests are a ready source of business when 
you’re starting out, especially if the transfer from your predecessors 
to you is handled well and your guests know who to expect at the front 
door (refer to the later section, “Transitioning an Existing B&B,” for 
instructions). The more repeat business the inn receives, the higher the 
perceived goodwill.
 
✓ Positive guest reviews: Nearly every inn has online reviews. Do an 
Internet search to find guest reviews for the inn you’re thinking of pur-
chasing. Positive reviews add to the goodwill of the bed & breakfast, and 
negative reviews take away from the goodwill — and thus the value of 
the B&B. If an inn has a disproportionate number of negative reviews, 
this could be a bargaining point and an important aspect of your early 
marketing efforts if you buy the property. (You can find more informa-
tion on updating your advertising at the end of this chapter.)

68
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Making an Offer
Congratulations, you’ve found the inn that you hope to own! Now it’s time to 
work with your team of experts (accountant, lawyer, inn broker, and inn con-
sultant, ideally), along with the seller to make sure that you strike a fair deal 
and that it goes through. If there are problems, you want them caught early 
so that they can be worked out.
The procedures and requirements for the process from offer to closing differ 
among states. Some states require formal initial purchase agreement pro-
cedures. In other states, presenting your offer along with a letter of intent 
Considering lifestyle inns versus 
investment-grade inns
Bed & breakfasts can be either lifestyle inns 
or investment-grade inns. Lifestyle inns are 
priced more for the value of the real estate and 
the land than the value of the business. The 
gross revenue of a lifestyle inn would not, in 
itself, provide a good return on your investment. 
Although you are buying a business, the major-
ity of the sales or list price of a lifestyle inn is for 
the real estate and land. Investment-grade inns 
are inns with very good cash flows and prices 
that are supported by their gross revenues. In 
the case of an investment-grade inn, the value 
of the business is realized because the cash 
flow it generates covers the investment. Both 
types of inns can make money and are run the 
same. They are both expected to show a profit 
at sale, but with lifestyle inns, a larger com-
ponent of the sale price is real-estate-based 
versus business-based.
Most inns for sale are lifestyle inns, but that 
doesn’t mean they don’t make good business 
sense! The rise in real-estate prices has made 
the underlying asset — the property — more 
valuable than the business that operates on it. 
The high price of real estate has made it more 
expensive to enter the bed & breakfast industry 
than it was years ago.
When considering a lifestyle inn, here are some 
questions to ask yourself:
 ✓ Is the bed & breakfast going to be your sole 
source of income? If so, will it be enough to 
sustain your style of living as well as cover 
the expenses of running a business?
 ✓ If it’s an existing inn, have the current inn-
keepers operated it as a serious business, 
or are there things you can do to boost 
occupancy? For example, if the inn doesn’t 
have a strong Internet presence, devoting 
resources to marketing could improve the 
numbers. (See Chapter 15 for help in finding 
ways to build on the existing business.)
 ✓ Does the business meet any other goals 
you may have, such as to be your own boss, 
live in a nice house, work with people, or 
provide a second income?

69
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
that spells out each party’s intentions and responsibilities is common. When 
you’re ready to make an offer, work closely with your broker and attorney to 
ensure it’s in the correct format for your area and jurisdiction.
The ideal situation is for the buyer, the seller, and their respective brokers 
to work collectively to come to an agreement in the period between offer and 
closing. Maintaining cordial relations with the seller during the negotiation 
phase makes it easier to work together during the transition phase, which I 
cover at the end of this chapter. This is an emotional process for both sides, 
so you may want to negotiate only through your broker to keep things official 
and professional. Inevitably, you and the seller each want the best price and 
terms that you can negotiate. However, your goal from offer to close should 
be to try and avoid an “us versus them” mentality and remember you’re 
working toward a common goal.
Outlining basic terms
Your first step in making an offer on an existing inn is to work with the seller 
and your brokers to negotiate the basic terms of the agreement. Establish at 
least the following terms:
 
✓ The purchase price, deposits, and contingencies
 
✓ A timeline for the sale process
 
✓ The major items included in and excluded from the sale
Part of the terms will come from the seller’s inclusion and exclusion lists. These 
lists detail what the seller is and isn’t including in the sale. For example, you 
should know ahead of time if the beautiful grandfather clock prominently pic-
tured on the inn’s Web site home page and incorporated into the inn’s logo is 
really a family heirloom that the sellers have no intention of leaving. The same 
is true if the antique bedroom furniture in several of the guest rooms belonged 
to the seller’s great-grandmother and he intends to take it with him. Sellers 
should have these lists already prepared as part of the listing process, but if 
they don’t exist yet, they should be created early in your negotiations, and you 
should review them carefully with the seller and both your brokers.
With the basic terms set, you prepare either a letter of intent or comparable 
agreement to comply with local regulations and formally present to the seller 
with your offer. Your documents should clearly state the terms that you’ve 
negotiated with the seller. Use Figure 4-1 as a guideline because these are the 
basic terms all agreements must cover, and then work with your broker and 
attorney to construct your offer in the format required in your area.

Checking the inn’s condition 
with inspections
Be prepared for inspections to turn up problems. This isn’t always a bad 
thing, however. You want to know about any issues before the deal is closed, 
because you become the not-so-proud owner of those problems and issues 
when you become the proud owner of the inn. At first, some problems may 
sound like deal-breakers (and some are, so don’t be afraid to walk away). 
However, take time to look at each problem and probe for solutions.
The most common inspection is an engineering inspection, and this is the 
one where most problems are discovered. Before panicking, talk to the 
engineer about possible solutions — and the estimated costs of those solu-
tions. Many times solutions and compromises can be made with the seller to 
accommodate these issue(s). Remember, the best compromises are when no 
one is happy because each side has had to give a little. Other inspections are 
covered in the previous “Verifying zoning, permits, and codes” section.

Preparing purchase and sale agreements
Depending on the regulations in your area, your lawyer, broker, and inn con-
sultant (if you’ve engaged one) prepare the necessary documents that are 
required for the deal to close. You should expect these documents to include 
the following information:
 
✓ Terms of the deal
 
✓ Time frame for contingencies
 
✓ Everything outlined in the letter of intent and/or contract
 
✓ Whether training from the seller is included, and if so, the duration 
and terms (see the later section, “Working side by side with the current 
innkeeper”)
 
✓ Supplies and inventories that have been negotiated into the sale and the 
purchase price
 
✓ Prepaid expenses for advertising, memberships, and so on, a schedule 
of which is usually prepared and attached as an addendum
 
✓ Allocation of assets to be sold
 
 The IRS treats the sale of business assets, such as real estate and per-
sonal property, differently depending on their particular value and 
classification. For tax purposes, be sure to get your accountant or con-
sultant to advise you in this matter.
 
✓ Boilerplate legal requirements, such as damage to the property before 
closing, applicable law, and so on
 
✓ The procedure for handling outstanding gift certificates, advance depos-
its, and advance reservations
 
 The procedure for handling outstanding gift certificates is a frequent 
issue between buyers and sellers because some gift certificates go 
unused and you have to make good on others as the new owner. The 
question becomes how much of the existing gift certificate sale pro-
ceeds should be transferred to you. Some states require that the value 
of unused gift certificates be escheated to the state, which means the 
monies are turned over to the state as abandoned property after a 
specified time. To further complicate matters, some certificates may 
have been promotional gift certificates for which the seller received no 
money but which you’ll have to honor when they’re redeemed. Usually 
the buyer and seller do come to an agreement on outstanding gift certifi-
cates. For example, knowing that 20 to 40 percent of gift certificates sold 
are never redeemed, the seller could turn over to the buyer 100 percent 
of gift certificates sold within the last 12 months, 75 percent of gift cer-
tificates that are 1 to 2 years old, and keep or escheat the remainder, 
depending on state law. Certificates issued for promotional purposes are 
handled separately. Some inns have opted to hold monies in escrow with 
an attorney, but this incurs additional fees and may not be necessary.

 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
Securing Financing
Expect this part of the sale process to take the longest. It’s probably also 
the most nerve-racking part, so in this section I give you some tips on what 
to expect and how best to approach the bank or lender. Hugh Daniels of Ask 
Hugh Consulting (www.askhugh.com) advises clients to plan to shop a loan 
to at least six lenders. All will say they’ll have an answer for you in 24 to 48 
hours, but it often takes months to get the loan through, so be patient and 
responsive as you go through the process.
Often the purchase and sale (P&S) agreements don’t allow sufficient time 
for you to get all the information you need to apply for the loan (including 
occupancies, average daily rates (ADRs), projections, business plan, and so 
on), get it to the bank, and get the loan approved. Twenty, even 30, days are 
often not enough, especially if a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan or 
guarantee is required. Inn consultant Hilary Jones (www.inngenium.com) 
advises clients to aim to set the contingency on their P&S for financing out at 
45 days from the acceptance of the offer.
Working with a bank
In many places, the local community bank is your best source of financing. 
Before going to the bank, however, you should assemble all your financial 
information in a simple but complete format. When you approach the bank 
with your financial information in hand, remember that you’re not asking for 
a loan. Rather, you’re telling the bank what you need from a business point of 
view and why. The loan process should work something like this:
 
1. Presentation of your plan to the bank. Your plan includes the following:
 
• The amount of the loan that you’re applying for and the amount 
of your down payment (in most cases, expect to put 20 percent 
down)
 
• Financial forecasts from your business plan
 
• Analysis of the current business’s performance for the past three 
years (primarily profit and loss statements and balance sheets 
from accounting software, such as QuickBooks)
 
• Three years’ worth of tax returns from the business
 
• Reserves or secondary sources of payment (the lender wants to 
know how you’ll repay the loan if the business can’t)
 
• Your resume with a listing of related activities indicating your 
experience related to innkeeping, including previous work experi-
ence, apprenticeships, training, and so on

74
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
 The bank wants to see how much cash flow there will be to cover the 
debt service on your loan. It’s not interested in your division of labor 
or your marketing strategy. Providing too much information with your 
loan application may actually cause confusion. On the other hand, you 
need to justify your projections, especially if the bank has never made 
a loan to a bed & breakfast; part of your job may be to educate the bank 
about what a bed & breakfast is in order to make everyone comfort-
able extending the loan to you. Your team of professionals can help you 
in this area, but you should be involved in every step of the process 
because the bank is making the loan to you.
 
2. Title searches and other checks. Who checks the real estate taxes and 
performs the other due diligence items, such as ordering a title search, 
varies by region, state, or local jurisdiction. In some areas or states, 
the bank does this, and in other areas, such as California, it’s custom-
ary for a title insurance company (also called an escrow company) to be 
assigned these duties.
 
3. Issuance of a terms letter. The bank sends you a letter that outlines 
what the loan would look like if you were to get an offer.
 
4. Issuance of a commitment. The loan committee offers you the loan, usu-
ally subject to a property appraisal.
The entire inn-purchasing process doesn’t come to a halt while you wait on 
financing. In the meantime, you and the seller can be working on issues and 
contingencies such as inventories and results of the engineering report.
Applying for an SBA loan
Many bed & breakfasts are wholly or partially financed with the help of a loan 
or guarantee from the SBA. You can read about the program on the SBA Web 
site at www.sba.gov. In the search box on the home page, enter “CDC/504 
Program” (CDC stands for Certified Development Company) or “7a loan.” The 
504 program provides long-term financing for economic development within 
a community, and a 7a loan is a guarantee program whereby the SBA guaran-
tees to repay your lender a portion of the loan if you default. Check with your 
lender to see which, if any, programs they offer.
Financing from the seller
In today’s complex world of financing and mortgage loans, creativity can 
pay off. Seller financing is only an option for qualified buyers when the seller 
doesn’t need the funds immediately. If the seller needs the proceeds from the 
sale of the inn to purchase another residence or another business, however, 

75
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
this arrangement isn’t possible. Generally speaking, sellers are only interested 
in providing financing if they’re reasonably assured that you’ll be able to make 
payments. They have no interest in repossessing the inn if you default.
Transitioning an Existing B&B
While it’s easy to pinpoint the exact date that you become the owner of your 
bed & breakfast (the day you close and finances change hands), there is no 
exact date when the transition process starts. There are also no set proce-
dures that must be followed, and a big variable in the process is the seller’s 
desired involvement in helping you through the transition phase.
Transition can be a frustrating time for you as the buyer. You’re anxious to 
put on your innkeeper hat, but the inn isn’t yours yet. I encourage you not to 
let this valuable time slip away. Instead, use it to prepare for the day that you 
welcome your first guests.
If you’re relocating to a new area in order to operate your bed & breakfast, 
you may be tempted to stay in your current job as long as possible and earn 
as much money as possible before transitioning to innkeeper. Be mindful, 
though, of what you’re giving up by continuing to work. The time before you 
take over your inn is the chance to get to know the area, your neighbors, other 
innkeepers in the area, and the sites and attractions that you’ll recommend to 
guests. Additionally, you should use this time before you take over your inn to 
get your advertising and marketing in place (see Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion on these elements). You can expect to be very busy once your inn is up 
and running under your management, so use this lead time wisely.
Working side by side with 
the current innkeeper
I’m sure you’re anxious to roll up your sleeves and get started doing things 
your way, but in your excitement, don’t skimp on learning everything you can 
about the inn, property, area, and experiences from the current innkeepers. 
Training is negotiable, but you should expect some sort of orientation as part 
of the transaction. When possible, aim for at least a week or two (depending 
on the size of the property and amount of business). If the seller isn’t prepared 
to offer more than a basic orientation, you may be able to negotiate additional 
consultations for a fee. Some consultants advise that the training should take 
place before the closing, when it’s clear who’s in charge. Others have seen too 
many sales fall through and feel strongly that training should occur after the 
closing. This will be another point of negotiation between you and the seller.

76
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
No matter when it’s conducted, on-site training is the best way for you to 
learn. Then, when it’s your turn to be in charge, you can do things differently 
if you choose. You’re taking over an existing inn, so learn as much as you can 
in order to harness the goodwill the inn has generated. Here are some sug-
gestions for using your time with the current innkeepers wisely:
 
✓ Learn software systems, and practice using them under the guidance 
of the current innkeeper. What may seem simple may not be when 
you’re on your own.
 
✓ Walk through every inch of the inn and go over every appliance to be 
sure that you know how it works. Pay close attention to any peculiari-
ties and how to handle them.
 
✓ Create folders with passwords, instructions, manuals, warranties, 
operating procedures, and so forth for everything at the inn.
 
✓ Make a complete list of all advertising, the expiration dates, and any 
passwords to manage it as well as a list of all current memberships 
and their expiration dates.
 
✓ Host a joint open house with the current innkeepers in order to meet 
the neighbors. The open house can be a combination gathering for the 
current innkeepers to say goodbye to old friends and thank them for 
their support and for you to be introduced to your new neighbors and 
other local businesses, giving them a chance to meet you and see the 
inn if they haven’t seen it in a while.
 
✓ Meet and get to know the staff. Find out about long-time staff members 
and everyone’s duties, responsibilities, strengths, and weaknesses.
 
✓ Jointly send out a letter to previous and future guests sharing the tran-
sition story. Let guests know what the current innkeepers will be doing, 
and introduce yourself. Consider including a special offer for return 
guests who visit during a certain period.
Keeping the name
When you buy an existing inn, you’re buying its goodwill, and this includes the 
name. If you change the inn name, you have to start from scratch to get your 
inn listed on Internet search engines (see Chapter 15 for information on search 
engines), in guidebooks, and so on. In general, you should keep the name unless 
it’s a really bad one or the property has suffered from negative reviews and pub-
licity, in which case you should definitely consider changing it and starting fresh.
If you decide that you must change the inn’s name, work through the pro-
cess outlined in Chapter 5 for naming your B&B. Then refer to Chapter 8 for 
important information on building your Web site and your brand, and getting 
your marketing started. Get everything ready to launch as soon as you leave 
the closing and are the innkeeper.

77
 Chapter 4: Purchasing an Existing B&B
Reviewing your marketing presence
You can start to review and make plans for your marketing promotion before 
you close on the inn; however, you can’t make changes without ownership 
and access. When you take ownership of the inn, you’ll be very busy, and 
your marketing is likely to be neglected. Making plans ahead of time makes 
it easier for you to bring your advertising up-to-date once you close on the 
property. Analyze the inn’s current marketing plan to see what’s working 
and look for missing opportunities. (Review Chapters 8 and 15 for important 
marketing tips.)
Making your Web site current
Sometimes innkeepers trying to sell an inn let updates to their Web site slide. 
If you’re planning on a complete redesign of the Web site, do it during the 
transition period. (See Chapter 8 for a list of Web site designers who special-
ize in the bed & breakfast industry.) Review the current Web site and make 
notes of sections and text that need updating, such as
 
✓ Your name(s) as innkeeper
 
✓ Specials and packages
 
✓ Keywords and area activities
 
✓ Pictures of the rooms and common areas
 
✓ Rates and policies
Updating your advertising
As you work on marketing during your transition period, you need to make 
sure that everything, everywhere about your B&B is correct, up-to-date, and 
presented in a good light. Although you should have performed an Internet 
search for the inn before you bought it, the transition period is the time to 
update any inaccuracies and to get any existing negative reviews and com-
ments removed. Contact the review site and let them know about the change 
in ownership. Be persistent about getting old negative reviews taken down, 
because they’ll hurt your business unnecessarily.
Make sure that all your advertising is up-to-date. Contact every directory that 
your inn is already listed on, and take advantage of the features included in 
the advertising package that the previous owners subscribed to. When that 
package expires, review its performance and determine its rate of return to 
see whether it warrants a continued investment. (Chapter 15 helps you evalu-
ate your advertising results.)

Starting a New Inn from Scratch
In This Chapter
▶ Weighing the option of creating a new inn
▶ Following the letter of the law: Zoning, permits, and licenses
▶ Building from the ground up
▶ Creating a B&B in an existing property
▶ Financing your dream
▶ Gearing up for the grand opening
C
hances are you have a picture in your mind of what your dream bed 
& breakfast looks like. You may have already performed an exhaus-
tive search for an existing inn that matches this vision but come up empty-
handed. As Plan B, you may have found the perfect piece of property with 
views so spectacular that it begs to be a bed & breakfast. Or maybe you’ve 
found a historic house that would be a perfect B&B, or you’ve decided to turn 
your own home into one. Perhaps you’ve simply always dreamed of building 
your own bed & breakfast. When you can’t find an existing inn to take on, you 
turn to the idea of starting a new B&B from scratch.
In this chapter, I show you how to turn your B&B dreams into reality, but 
first I point out the pros, cons, and unique challenges of starting your own 
inn from scratch, either by building a new inn or converting your home or an 
existing property. Most importantly, I share the most common reasons that 
innkeepers run into problems when starting a new inn so that you can avoid 
them, and I help you get your new place up and running through the naming 
process and an open house.
Considering the New-Inn Option
Although not as common as purchasing an existing bed & breakfast, people 
build new inns and successfully convert properties into B&Bs for a variety 
of reasons. Creating a new inn is an exciting process, and when you start 
fresh you may have the advantage of new plumbing and electric, a new roof, 
new windows, new flooring, and new technology. Even better, you have 

80
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
easy access to the insulation in the walls to make sure it’s adequate, which 
not only saves on heating costs but also gives your guests a level of privacy 
through soundproofing.
The biggest drawback of building an inn from the ground up or converting an 
existing property is cash flow, because you don’t have the benefit of reserva-
tions on the books and past guests to contact you for future bookings, as you 
do when buying an existing inn. It may cost more to build or renovate and 
furnish a new inn than to buy an existing inn that’s already furnished. On the 
other hand, you’re able to decorate and furnish the inn over time in accor-
dance with your tastes and with modern appliances and guest conveniences, 
such as jetted tubs. Equally as important to how the inn looks on the inside 
is how it looks on the outside. This means setting aside adequate funds to 
design a beautiful and comfortable interior as well as to cover landscaping 
costs, in order to create an inviting first impression when your guests arrive.
 
New innkeepers often underestimate the costs of landscaping. The outside is 
the first part of your inn that your guests see when they arrive, and they 
should see well-landscaped and appealing surroundings. Sparsely landscaped 
yards and gardens can look unfinished, and outdoor areas that still look like a 
construction zone are even worse. No matter how wonderful your B&B is on 
the inside, thanks to the service and hospitality that you offer, the exterior 
also must present a warm welcome. Mature trees and plants are the easiest 
way to create this image. Landscaping is expensive, so when carving out the 
footprint for the building, be mindful of existing trees and shrubs that you can 
preserve and reuse (a good architect can help you with this).
 
Early in the building process, designate a parking lot and staging area for your 
contractor and crew to use in order to avoid damage to outdoor areas.
It’s Not Up to You: Zoning 
and Other Legalities
Many otherwise fabulous new B&B plans have stumbled because of one big 
problem — they can’t be completed because of zoning restrictions. This is 
the area that causes new innkeepers the most headaches and is the reason 
many projects fail, often after the prospective innkeeper has spent a lot of 
money. In your excitement to build or to convert a property into your dream 
B&B, it’s easy to become so passionate that you let your good business 
instincts relax. Doing your homework ahead of time to find out what a pro-
spective property is or isn’t zoned for and getting conditional use permit(s), 
if required, will prevent this from happening to you. Even if you think that the 
property you’re considering would be the perfect place for a bed & breakfast, 

81
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
or if you strongly believe the town should embrace your inn because there’s 
a need for such a business, don’t proceed if you don’t have the proper zoning 
and permits to build and run your dream inn.
 
The terms conditional use permit and variance are often used interchange-
ably. However, correctly used, a change in use for a single property is almost 
always called a conditional use permit (such as allowing a property to operate 
as a B&B in a residential area), whereas a variance is getting permission to 
make a change in the property, essentially allowing the property owner an 
exception to break the dimensional rules (such as setbacks or height limits) 
that would otherwise apply.
Zoning, permits, licenses, and restrictions vary greatly by area. Sometimes 
one county or town is particularly strict, but a location nearby may be very 
welcoming to your plans. Many states are strict on the number of rooms 
that you can have without building under commercial hotel guidelines. Some 
states and localities limit expansion, meaning you can’t buy a four-room inn 
and renovate it to add three more rooms. This section outlines the major 
legal requirements and restrictions you face and must meet in order to get 
your new B&B up and running.
Getting to know state, county, and town 
zoning and building regulations
It would be great if common sense and persistence resolved all zoning issues, 
but this simply isn’t the case. For the most part, you have no choice but 
to work with existing regulations. However, some zoning laws are open to 
exceptions and can reasonably be changed. If you do need a conditional use 
permit, it’s important to get this commitment before you begin your project. 
Examples of zoning ordinances that have restricted prospective innkeepers’ 
dreams include the following:
 
✓ The number of rooms a B&B can have: Local definitions of a bed & 
breakfast are often defined by the number of bedrooms. For instance, 
in some towns, anything more than four rooms is not considered a B&B 
and is either not permitted by zoning code or requires the inn to pay 
higher commercial property tax rates. Often the inclusion of more bed-
rooms brings additional requirements for the inn, such as a commercial 
kitchen (which involves expensive commercial equipment and a separate 
hand-washing sink, and therefore can cost ten times as much as a regu-
lar kitchen), a fire sprinkler system (which can cost as much as $50,000 
depending on the size), large parking areas, additional taxes, and so on.

82
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
✓ Outright denial to convert or build a bed & breakfast on a residential 
lot: The town zoning commission may not allow a B&B on a residential 
lot, but neighborhood support sometimes helps in these instances. It 
certainly never hurts to have your neighbors on your side. I talk about 
educating and partnering with your neighbors later in this section.
 
✓ The size of the septic system: If your proposed property doesn’t have 
access to a public sewage system, a percolation test must be performed 
to determine the sewage capacity of the soil and, therefore, the size of 
the septic system that the lot can accommodate. To adhere to zoning 
laws, you need to have a large enough septic system for the size of the 
inn that you’re planning to build or convert.
 
In addition to building restrictions, there may be zoning and health depart-
ment restrictions on meal preparation that limit your business. For example, 
even though it’s your home, you may be surprised to find out that some 
departments don’t allow the use of a range or oven to prepare breakfast, limit-
ing your menu to continental breakfast. Many areas don’t allow the prepara-
tion of dinner for B&B lodging guests without additional permits, inspections, 
and possibly a commercial kitchen. This is an important consideration if 
you’re a rural property with limited nearby dining options, or if serving dinner 
is part of your future expansion plans.
To avoid any kind of zoning or permit problems, follow these steps:
 
1. Research all the regulations and restrictions on new building design 
and construction that your zoning commission, building department, 
and fire and health departments have, to see which may affect the 
design of your property.
 
2. Work with an architect to design your building plans with these 
restrictions in mind.
 
3. Meet with the various departments to review your conceptual draw-
ings prior to finalizing the architect’s drawings.
 
4. Incorporate the departments’ comments into your building plans and 
finalize your plans.
 
If you don’t yet own the property or if you’re building your B&B from scratch, 
always get approval on your plans in writing from the various state, county, 
and town zoning and building boards before proceeding. If they won’t put it in 
writing, there’s a problem, and you need to find out what it is and deal with it 
before you start work on your inn.
Because many local zoning laws were written before B&Bs became popular, 
bed & breakfast zoning is often a gray area in zoning and building codes. If 
the land that you want to build on or the property that you want to convert 

83
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
isn’t currently zoned for commercial use, you can apply for a conditional 
use permit in order to operate your B&B. Procedures, rules, and guidelines 
differ by area, and you need to do some investigating to find out the specifics 
for your situation. Here are some suggestions to help the process go more 
smoothly:
 
✓ Educate your neighbors and local officials about what a B&B is. 
Frequently, local concern and opposition stems from the fear that 
allowing one business to operate in a residential neighborhood opens 
the town up to numerous commercial business applications, causing 
increased traffic, overcrowded parking conditions, and other unpleas-
antries. By letting neighbors and local officials know the types of guests 
your inn will host (neighbors need to be assured that you’re not running 
a boarding house) and the typical behavior of B&B guests (local officials 
will like hearing that they will patronize local restaurants and busi-
nesses, yet cause less traffic than a new dental practice) you can help to 
dispel the myths and fears about a new B&B in town. Find out what the 
local concern is, and contact state and local B&B associations for facts 
and figures that could help to alleviate these fears.
 
✓ Be upfront with your neighbors, and listen to their concerns. When 
people think that you’re trying to pull something over on them, their 
suspicion makes them instinctively oppose your activity. Often local 
opposition is the biggest reason permits are denied, so the biggest 
mistake you can make is not obtaining your neighbors’ support and 
excluding them from your plans. If you’re upfront with them from the 
beginning, educate them about what you want to do and the effect it will 
have on them, listen to their objections, and so on, you’ll have a better 
chance of engaging their support.
 
✓ Talk to local innkeepers. Don’t be afraid to ask zoning or other permit 
questions of experienced B&B owners who have inns in the area you’re 
considering. They can share their experiences with you and hopefully 
give advice for getting through rough patches.
 
 Talking with your potential competition may seem uncomfortable for 
you, but it’s the best way to introduce yourself, and it gives you a feel 
for the type of camaraderie that exists among other innkeepers. After 
you’re open for business, you’ll refer your overflow to these inns and 
vice versa.
 
 Your attitude in approaching local seasoned innkeepers sets the tone 
for your relationships. Temper your enthusiasm with a willingness to 
listen and learn from them, because these people will more than likely 
become your best allies and your good friends.

Complying with codes for 
handicap accessibility
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) establishes regulations that allow 
people with disabilities physical access to public buildings. These restric-
tions may impact the entrance to your facility (requiring a ramp), the width 
of hallways and doors, and the type of fixtures that you use. Generally speak-
ing, new construction must meet stricter rules than conversions of existing 
or historical properties that are already serving the public. Licensed archi-
tects should be familiar with ADA code and able to help you determine what 
you must do to be in compliance on your project. The requirements of some 
states differ from the federal ADA requirements, but in general, properties 
that have five or fewer rooms to rent and where the proprietor lives in the 
same building are exempt from ADA compliance. If you’re building a new 
inn, however, regardless of the size, you should plan to meet as many ADA 
requirements as you can. Being able to offer accommodations to those with 
special needs enables you to accommodate another group of guests, plus, 
although you would expect your inn to be grandfathered in to new regula-
tions, you never know when laws may change.
 
When in doubt about the application of ADA law in your new building plans, 
contact the local building/planning department rather than going on hearsay 
from other inn owners.
At some point during your innkeeping career you may be contacted by a 
guest who needs to bring a service animal with him to your inn. Regardless of 
whether your inn has five rooms or less or you have a no-pet policy, you have 
no choice but to host the service animal under the ADA. For additional infor-
mation on service animals and the ADA, visit www.ada.gov/svcanimb.htm.
Passing building inspections
A building inspector will make inspections at critical times throughout the 
building process to ensure that the structure is meeting all codes and match-
ing the plans that you submitted. The number of inspections is up to the 
inspector in the jurisdiction where your property is located. Your general 
contractor and architect will work with the inspectors throughout the inspec-
tion process as your inn comes together. You have no involvement in the 
inspection process, other than to stay out of the way. In many cases, the 
contractor has a rapport with the inspector and interference from the build-
ing owner (asking questions) could impede the process. If you’re curious, 
you can obtain a list of conditions for occupancy from your Department of 
Buildings or equivalent entity. However, any questions that you have should 
be directed to your contractor or architect. The critical inspection is the final 
one, giving you the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) that’s necessary in order to 

85
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
greet your first guest — although it’s not uncommon to get a temporary CO 
(TCO) while minor things are completed, such as painting, landscaping, and 
so on. A TCO may require an additional fee and is only issued for a limited 
period of time.
Earning the necessary licenses
In order to open and operate your B&B, you need to meet the requirements 
set by your city, county, and/or state for business licenses. Licensing needs 
and renewal requirements vary by location and by the activities that you con-
duct at your inn (such as selling retail items). Use the list below as a check-
list; however, be sure to check with your lawyer, your state, city hall, and 
other innkeepers for information and requirements in your area.
 
✓ Conditional use permit: This gives you the authority to operate a B&B 
at your location (if necessary). (See “It’s not up to you: Zoning and other 
legalities,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
✓ Employer Identification Number (EIN): If you have at least one 
employee and/or your business structure is other than a sole proprietor-
ship, you need to obtain a federal employer ID number. You also need to 
obtain a state employer ID number. For more information and to find out 
how to apply for an EIN online, visit the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov 
and enter “EIN” in the search box. For state ID numbers, check online for 
your state Web site and search for “starting a business.” Before apply-
ing, you need to know the legal structure of your business (see Chapter 
3, where I cover how to make these decisions with your accountant and 
attorney). If your legal structure is a sole proprietorship, you file your 
tax returns using your social security number. That may or may not be 
true for your state returns, and some states may require a different tax 
ID number from your employer ID number.
 
✓ Business license: This is the main document required for tax purposes 
and other business functions. To learn requirements in your area, con-
tact the county clerk’s office or city clerk’s office.
 
✓ DBA: This is your “doing business as” or fictitious business name 
license. Having a DBA allows you to legally operate under your business 
name, so check with your attorney for help.
 
✓ Certificate of Occupancy: This authorizes your property for public 
occupancy. (I cover this information in the preceding section.)
 
✓ Fire, building, and safety inspections: Your local city hall can help you 
with this list so you know what to expect in your area.
 
✓ Health department inspections and permit, food handler’s license, 
and miscellaneous licenses: In some areas, additional licenses are 
required, such as hot tub licenses.

86
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
 Local health departments require training and certification for safe food 
handling in order to receive their licenses. Contact your local health 
department for information on training requirements. ServSafe (www.
servsafe.com) is the most widely accepted food safety program and 
satisfies the requirements of most local, state, and federal health depart-
ment standards. (They also have a program for responsible alcohol 
practices.)
 
✓ Alcohol license or permit: These are usually state-issued, and each state 
has its own regulations and requirements. In some areas, you may need 
to apply for a license from your town or city as well, so start with your 
county or town clerk’s office to find out about requirements in your area.
 
✓ Sign permit: In many areas, in order to put a sign outside of your inn, 
you need to obtain a sign permit. Don’t be surprised, however, if some 
areas don’t allow this at all. Check with your local zoning office about 
restrictions and requirements in your area.
 
✓ Seller’s permit: Sometimes called a certificate of resale, this permit is 
required when selling retail items or when sales tax is charged. The 
permit lets you collect required sales taxes from guests and turn these 
monies over to the state. Contact your state tax board, department of 
revenue, or similar entity for information.
 
 A seller’s permit is not the same as a transient tax or bed tax that most 
towns or counties also require you to collect. Typically, a transient or bed 
tax is collected monthly or quarterly by the town or county and is added 
to the sales tax amount that you charge guests for lodging. Where 
required, it’s filed as a report and no additional license is required. Check 
with your county clerk’s office for collection and filing requirements.
Funding Your Project
When building or renovating a new inn, you need to shop around for financ-
ing. Local, regional banks are your best source and the easiest to work with.
To avoid unnecessary fees, get a construction loan that later rolls into perma-
nent financing after the construction phase is completed. This arrangement 
avoids the need to have two loans (a construction loan and then a conven-
tional loan). Having one loan helps you know the amount of your debt service 
in order to set and stick to a budget, which therefore gives you a great deal of 
incentive to set a firm and fixed price with your contractor. After all, the bank 
isn’t giving you an open-ended source of financing, and if you go over budget 
you have to go back to the bank to apply for additional financing.

87
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
Because you aren’t able to show the bank current cash flow numbers as 
you would be able to when buying an existing inn, a well-written and well-
presented business and financial plan is extremely important in securing 
financing. (Refer to Chapter 3 for help in writing a business plan.) Consider 
hiring an industry consultant for help and to add credibility to your plan.
Don’t underestimate your participation in the process of securing a loan for 
the work on your new inn. Show bank representatives both your professional-
ism and your passion. Ask about the process for loan approval and find out 
how you can be involved. As you go through the process, continuously ask 
what else you need to provide so that the loan can be approved. If your lender 
is not familiar with the community your B&B will be located in or the B&B 
industry in general, then you need to educate the lender to help convince 
her that your project makes sense. One way to do this is to gather a team 
that might include an economic development person from the county and an 
inn consultant, plus industry statistics from the Professional Association of 
Innkeepers International (PAII) or your state or local B&B association to help 
the lender obtain the answers necessary to make the loan commitment.
Building from Scratch
When you build your inn from the ground up, you have a chance to give 
guests what they want and yourself what you need, after considering zoning 
and financial considerations of course. When you design your inn, you have 
the chance to influence guests’ experiences at your inn by determining such 
things as the location and size of the guest rooms and big amenities like soak-
ing tubs, fireplaces, or seating and dining areas. You also have the chance to 
build your own living quarters and work areas with the benefit of hindsight 
from seasoned innkeepers and information that you glean from this book. In 
order to make your dream B&B a reality, you need to hire an architect and a 
contractor. The following sections steer you in the right directions.
Designing the B&B of your dreams
Get out a piece of paper and draw a line down the center of it. On one side of 
the line, write down all the things you liked about previous B&B stays, and on 
the other side, jot down anything you disliked. Keep adding to this list every 
time you think of something. Before sitting down with the architect to begin 
designing your inn, look at the list of things you liked and circle all the struc-
tural things that should be added during the building stage. Cross off any that 
don’t fit into your budget, those that fall outside the zoning laws, any that 
won’t appeal to your target market, and those that aren’t normally offered in 
B&Bs and rooms within your intended rate range.

88
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Many of your design decisions are dictated by zoning code and local ordi-
nances. However, all your decisions should keep the safety and comfort of 
your guests in mind.
Giving your guests what they want
When starting a new B&B project, one of the hardest things to understand 
and envision is the concept of space. Measure your own bedroom and bath-
room at home, and measure guest rooms and bathrooms at every hotel and 
B&B you stay at as part of your research process. Which ones feel like a good 
size? As you get a feel for square footage in these spaces, you can figure out 
what is and what isn’t enough for your own inn.
The size of guest rooms and bathrooms should match the price point — what 
you want to charge for your rooms. Also, when planning your guest rooms, 
consider the size of the beds and approximately where they’ll be placed 
within the rooms. Then measure to be sure the planned room provides 
adequate space around all sides of the bed and space for other furniture in 
the room. When your inn opens, you’ll be selling a room experience, which 
means you’re selling space.
Here’s a list of guest-friendly features that are guaranteed to be on the dream 
lists of seasoned innkeepers. You may want to include them in the plans for 
your own inn, particularly the spaces used by guests:
 
✓ Private en suite bath for each guest room
 
✓ Public half bath near common areas
 
✓ On-demand hot water to each guest bathroom
 
✓ Adequate hot water and water pressure
 
✓ Individual climate control for each guest room (sometimes required by 
code)
 
✓ Dual sinks in guest bathrooms
 
✓ At least one parking space per room
 
✓ Wet bar for guest refreshments
 
✓ Fireplaces and jetted tubs in guest rooms (depending on targeted clientele)
 
✓ Generator
 
 The value of a generator depends on your location. If you’re in an area 
that frequently loses power or that has above-ground power lines, a gen-
erator is worth considering.
 
✓ Adequate electrical service (for the kitchen, laundry, and guest room 
whirlpools and spas, and also for lighting outdoor areas, such as walk-
ways, patios, parking areas, signs, and recreational areas)
 
✓ Plenty of closet space

89
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
 
The design phase is the best time to decide what kind of furniture you want 
and where it will be placed in the guest rooms so you can be sure the 
rooms you design are big enough. You also need to plan for things such as 
soaking tubs and so on. (See Chapter 9 for ideas and considerations when 
furnishing your inn.) Remember to select features based on where your inn 
is located, your target market, the profile of the guests that you hope to 
attract, and the price of your rooms.
Giving yourself what you need
“You might be an innkeeper if you have a 5,000-square foot house and live in 
500 square feet of it!” This quote from the humor section of the Florida B&B 
association newsletter isn’t much of an exaggeration. If they had it to do over 
again, many innkeepers I’ve spoken with would have given more thought to 
the space they carved out for themselves when they set up their inns. If you 
plan to be an on-site innkeeper, you’ll rarely get a second chance to extend 
your personal living quarters. In general, according to PAII’s Industry Study 
of Operation and Finance, the average size of innkeeper’s quarters is increas-
ing, with about half of the participating inns having innkeeper’s quarters of 
more than 1,000 square feet. Keep in mind this is an average — some inn-
keepers have just one room for themselves, which I don’t recommend.
Some innkeepers decide to start out with smaller innkeeper’s quarters so that 
in a few years they can move off-site and hire a night manager to occupy their 
former quarters. Less square footage for you can mean more square footage 
for bringing in revenue. It’s important to strike a good balance that works 
for you, and these considerations should be part of your business planning 
process. The size of your living space and the privacy your quarters offer 
you will have an effect on your burnout rate, because you can easily become 
resentful of guests’ spacious accommodations if you’re feeling cramped and 
trapped in your own small quarters. So although guest rooms take priority, 
be sure not to neglect your own quarters in the planning of your bed & break-
fast. (See Chapter 9 for information on furnishing your new home and tips for 
separating your personal space from the public areas of your inn.)
 
Although selling your inn is the farthest thing from your mind, buyers often 
choose an inn based on superior innkeeper’s quarters. It doesn’t hurt to keep 
this in mind as you plan your own place; more likely than not, the day will 
come when you’re ready to put your place on the market. Why not give your-
self a leg up on the competition?
Your private space needs to be comfortable for you and your family or part-
ners. Planning ahead for your space, your privacy, and anything that makes 
the job of innkeeping easier is a benefit of building your inn from scratch, so 
take advantage of it! Following are some features and accommodations to 
give some serious thought to in different areas and aspects of the innkeeper’s 
quarters:

90
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
✓ Office: You’re running a business, so you need plenty of room for a 
desk, filing cabinets, and office equipment, such as a computer, printer, 
and so on.
 
✓ Kitchen: An efficient kitchen with room to work and good appliances 
makes your life easier. A commercial kitchen is ideal but very expensive. 
(Verify whether a commercial kitchen is required as part of your operat-
ing code.) When selecting appliances, purchase ones that will grow with 
your business, including a large enough refrigerator, stove, oven, and so 
on. (Refer to Chapter 13 for information on kitchen tools and equipment 
that can make your life easier.) Also, I recommend extra-deep (30-inch) 
counters and a three-bin kitchen sink.
 
✓ Laundry room: A lot of laundry will be done over the life of your inn, so 
set aside a large laundry area and stock it well. Factor in the size of the 
laundry room to not only hold the equipment that you buy now but also 
to add more equipment later on as the occupancy of the inn increases 
(for example, additional dryers are often on many innkeepers’ wish 
lists). Refer to Chapter 13 for information on laundry tools and equip-
ment that can make your life easier. Consider the amount of electrical 
service available in your laundry room as well as incoming water lines, 
the source and heat of the water, and the size of the wastewater drains.
 
 It’s ideal to have a water source for the laundry that’s separate from the 
source of water for your guests. Then you can use higher water tempera-
tures in the production areas (the laundry room and the kitchen) of your 
inn and you won’t have to worry about water pressure for guests’ showers.
 
✓ Personal retreat: Be sure to give yourself enough space to create your 
own haven: a place that you can retreat to with a feeling of “Ah, I’m 
home,” when you’re done with work or taking a break.
 
✓ Private entrance: Guests should know when you’re away from the inn and 
how to reach you in the event of an emergency, but the ability to come and 
go via a private entrance to your quarters helps you run your business — 
from completing errands to being on time for appointments — without 
feeling like you have to cut guests off mid-conversation. Personal visitors 
also can use your private entrance to your guest quarters, allowing you to 
further separate business from pleasure.
 
✓ Private outdoor space: When possible, your B&B design should factor in 
outdoor areas that are private and preferably secluded so that you have 
a casual space to relax without being joined by guests.
 
✓ Parking: You should have separate innkeeper parking, or at least suffi-
cient parking space in the guest parking area.
 
✓ Workshop: If you’re handy and plan on repairing items, staining furni-
ture, and so on, carve out space for a workshop so you can do these 
tasks away from your guests’ view.

91
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
 
✓ Storage space: Plan for adequate storage space. You’ll be amazed how 
much space you’ll quickly use storing holiday decorations, bulk pur-
chases, extra supplies, and so on.
 
 Double the amount of storage that you think you need for general stor-
age and in guest rooms.
 
Discuss with your accountant or consultant any tax implications involved if 
your residence is physically separated from the inn, such as a private apart-
ment behind the main house.
Hiring a good architect and contractor
Hiring a good architect and contractor is the key to a smooth and success-
ful project. Ideally, you should hire your architect first to design the plan 
for your inn, which you’ll then put out to bid with various contractors. 
Additionally, the architect can often make recommendations for contractors 
whom you should consider. A big exception to the order in which you hire 
these key people is having a contractor who comes highly recommended to 
you — then he can make referrals for architects.
The best way to find a good contractor and a good architect is through first-
hand referrals. All professionals can furnish you with references, but don’t 
expect them to give you the names of dissatisfied customers. It’s up to you to 
do your homework and get referrals from respected sources.
 
Consider going straight to the source: job sites the contractors and archi-
tects are currently working. When Dave Reusing began interviewing archi-
tects and contractors for the renovation of Town Hill Bed & Breakfast (www.
townhillbnb.com) in Little Orleans, Maryland, he didn’t ask them for refer-
ences but rather what jobs they were currently working on. He then went to 
those job sites to see how the projects were going and spoke with the owners 
to find out whether they were happy with the process and progress of the 
work being done.
Working with an architect
You want an architect who can share your vision for your B&B. It’s critical 
that the architect you hire is someone with whom you can communicate and 
work easily, because there will be a lot of communication and exchange of 
ideas surrounding the plans. Architects often specialize in particular types 
of projects — for example, designing homes, schools, or hospitals. Hiring a 
small firm with a focus on residential design but an understanding of com-
mercial or hotel codes is a good choice because your architect needs to be 
sensitive to the needs of the lodging industry. For example, your architect 
needs to understand the importance of the building materials chosen, such 
as soundboard that provides another layer for soundproofing.

92
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
To avoid guesswork and save time in working with the architect you choose to 
design your inn, follow these tips:
 
✓ Be specific in all your communications. Rather than telling the architect 
that you want a large whirlpool in the Garden Room, clarify that you 
envision a 48-x-78-inch whirlpool with bubble jets in the bathroom of 
Guest Room One. Be ready to share images, brands, and model numbers 
of the equipment, fixtures, and appliances you want to use.
 
✓ Make a list of fixtures and appliances, room by room. Keep one copy on 
your computer and a hard copy at the construction site.
 
✓ Check stock and availability of fixtures and appliances when you make 
your selections during the design phase. I know of one innkeeper who 
wanted a specific bathtub that required an order to be placed six 
months in advance because the manufacturing plant was in South Africa. 
Many years later, this tub still looks great and the guests love it. But it’s 
only there because of the advanced research that alerted the innkeeper 
to the lead time necessary for ordering it.
Working with a contractor
When hiring and working with your contractor, here are some things to know:
 
✓ By law, contractors must be licensed, bonded, and insured. In addi-
tion to these protections, you need to purchase your own Builder’s 
Risk insurance policy for the duration of the construction. This is 
a temporary policy that provides another level of insurance cover-
age during the construction process. It protects you, the owner, and 
the contractor against loss, theft, or damage during the construction 
process. Ask your current home or auto insurance agent whether they 
provide this type of insurance, how much it costs, and what coverage it 
provides. If they don’t offer it, they can usually make recommendations 
for agents who do, or you can ask other innkeepers who have built or 
renovated their inns for recommendations.
 
✓ All prices are negotiable. Do your homework on pricing so you have 
better leverage to negotiate.
 
✓ You arrange to pay the contractor in stages. The release of funds 
against your loan is commonly called a draw against the construction 
loan in that you are drawing down the funds from the total available. 
Most lenders have staff members who visit job sites to verify that the 
project is at the completion stage for the requested draw. For example, 
your contract with the contractor may request a 10 percent payment 
when the foundation is complete. While you may call the lender and 
authorize the release of the funds, the lender’s inspector may visit to 
insure that the foundation is, in fact, complete. This insures that the 
funds will be there for the final phases of construction per the contract.

93
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
 
✓ You specify all the materials to be used in your B&B project, unless 
you make other arrangements with the contractor. For example, you 
choose kitchen appliances with model numbers and finishes, carpet, tile, 
window types, and so on.
 
✓ The general contractor should be responsible for and should oversee 
the subcontractors.
 
✓ You should request a Release of Liens to ensure that you aren’t respon-
sible for any supplies, materials, or labor from the subcontractors.
 
To keep costs down, help out. If your contractor is working for time and mate-
rials fees, anything that you can do to save some billable time will save you 
money. For example, you might pick up some supplies or help with cleanup 
around the job site. Just don’t get in the way of work being done — that 
wastes just as much time as you’re trying to save!
Keeping track of the building process
With your architect, contractor, permits, and funding in place, the building 
process begins! This will be your preoccupation for the foreseeable future. 
Although the process is different for the building of each inn, here are some 
of the main things you should expect during a typical building project:
 
✓ A meeting with the HVAC installer. You’ll meet with the heating and a/c 
installer to discuss the location for the exterior and interior equipment, 
such as thermostats, a/c return, air grills, and a/c and heat controls for 
each room (which I recommend). Your job before this meeting is to plan 
where furniture will be located in the rooms — you don’t want the floor 
grill to be covered later by an armoire.
 
✓ A meeting with the electrician. After all stud walls are in place, you’ll 
meet with the electrician on-site with a floor plan to review the locations 
of all equipment requiring special electrical switches, plugs, speakers, 
telephones, and so on.
 
✓ A meeting with other subcontractors. Depending on your project, you 
may also meet with other subcontractors, such as the plumber or the 
person installing your Internet or sound system.
 
 The electrician, HVAC installer and so on are subcontractors and 
employed by your contractor. While these people have building plans, 
they often don’t read them closely and they don’t know where you’ll be 
placing appliances and furniture, so discuss with your architect and con-
tractor when the best time is to set up a meeting with each subcontrac-
tor to review the key placement of outlets, controls, and the like. You 
should have already reviewed these decisions with your architect, who 
will help you make sure you aren’t forgetting anything, and the architect 
may or may not be present at these meetings.

94
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
 
✓ Weekly progress meetings. You should have weekly meetings — ideally 
on the job site but some can be done by phone — with your contractor 
to review progress and obstacles. I encourage you to keep the tone of 
these weekly meetings or phone calls very friendly and professional. 
As the owner, you want to do everything you can to support the con-
tractor in his efforts to build your inn on time and on budget. Don’t get 
argumentative or create an adversarial relationship. Yes, he technically 
works for you, but treat him as you would a guest — it’s good practice!
Converting an Existing 
Property into an Inn
The process of purchasing a property to convert into your bed & breakfast 
or turning your own home into a B&B is similar to building your inn from 
scratch. It’s easy to get excited about a beautiful property or your desire to 
find a way to earn extra money from your existing home, but remember that 
this is a big business decision you’re making. I outline the key considerations 
to help you through this process in the following sections.
 
The property on which a bed & breakfast resides is only a small part of its 
being. The majority of what makes a bed & breakfast comes from the guests’ 
experiences. You can’t simply convert a property or your home into a place 
where you rent rooms for extra income, magically open your doors to guests, 
and think you have a bed & breakfast. Without thought, planning, preparation, 
training, and commitment to the guest experience, you’re merely running a 
boarding house.
Answering key questions
It’s important that you take a good, hard look at the property and visualize 
it as a bed & breakfast. Analyze its possibilities and potential (both legal and 
practical) in the same ways you would if it were an existing B&B or if you 
were choosing a plot to build an inn from scratch. Key questions you’ll need 
to answer are: Can I do this? Will guests come? Can I provide guests a com-
fortable lodging experience here so that they will return and refer others?
Getting a conditional use permit if you need it
The biggest obstacle to converting an existing property is zoning, no matter 
whether it’s a property that you think would make a fabulous setting for a bed 
& breakfast or whether you’re converting your own home into a B&B. If the 
property you want to convert is in a residential neighborhood (which most 
are) and not zoned for commercial use, you need to apply for a conditional 

95
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
use permit. In a residential neighborhood, your neighbors play a big role in 
whether you get approval or your plans and dreams end at the local zoning 
board office or planning commission. Refer to the earlier section, “Getting to 
know state, county, and town zoning and building regulations,” for more infor-
mation, and don’t proceed with the conversion of the property until all permits 
and licenses are in place.
Confirming your location
Opening a B&B is a big commitment and a career decision, not something 
you should do because you’re trying to achieve the objective of living some-
where that you can’t afford otherwise (although this may be a nice side 
benefit). No matter how beautiful a property is, if it’s not in a good location, 
guests won’t visit. At a minimum, the property must be located in an area 
that offers popular attractions or it must be a convenient and frequent stop-
over point between two other popular locations. Chapter 2 helps you analyze 
potential B&B locations.
Carving out the space
When deciding whether it makes sense to convert an existing property into a 
bed & breakfast, it’s important to consider the space and layout. Answer the 
following key questions to get a better feel for how the space will work for 
your needs:
 
✓ Are the guest rooms, common areas, and utility areas (including laundry 
and kitchen) large enough?
 
✓ Approximately how much will it cost to make renovations to bring the 
building up to code and to make the size of the rooms or the layout con-
ducive to a bed & breakfast?
 
✓ Does the placement of the guest rooms and the innkeeper’s quarters 
make sense? Can you create a true sense of privacy for your guests?
 
✓ Are there enough bathrooms? Are they private? If they’re separate from 
the rooms, are they in good proximity to the rooms? Or are the bath-
rooms now — or will they be — en suite?
 
✓ Will you have sufficient private space in your innkeeper’s quarters?
Restoring a historic or 
conventional property
If the property you’re looking to convert into a B&B is officially on the 
National Register of Historic Places (www.nps.gov/nr), the property has 
been designated by the National Park Service as having significance to 
the history of the community, state, or nation. Before renovating such a 

96
Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
property, consult with your State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in 
addition to local authorities. You can find the contact information for your 
SHPO by visiting www.nps.gov/history/nr/shpolist.htm.
Compliance with ADA laws is more complicated for historic and existing 
conventional structures due to their exceptions. Neither type of property 
is exempt from ADA compliance unless it qualifies as having five rooms or 
less with the owner living within the building, as I discuss in the earlier sec-
tion, “Complying with codes for handicap accessibility.” There are some 
exceptions based on the ability to make changes and their financial impact. 
Exceptions generally have to be adjudicated if there’s a complaint about the 
property, because sometimes the law can be vague. The law does allow you 
to make accommodations; for instance, if a guest can’t get to your dining 
room for breakfast, you can serve it to her in her guest room.
Converting your home into a B&B
If you decide to turn your own home into a B&B, you need to follow all the 
considerations in the previous sections under this main topic of conversion. 
However, one additional big point that you must think long and hard about 
is this: You need to accept and understand that your home is no longer a 
private residence but rather a place of business where you, your family, and 
your guests must be comfortable. Plan the layout and the conversion of your 
home so that your guests don’t feel that they’re encroaching on your private 
living quarters. As guests paying to stay in your home, they don’t want to 
hear your family discussions or TV noise coming from your private rooms.
Because renovations are nearly always required, owners tend to minimize 
the size of the job and underestimate the amount of time the renovations will 
take, so be sure to work out a time line with your architect and contractor 
before the project starts. Then factor in inevitable delays. Make good use of 
this time by getting your marketing ready (see Chapter 8).
Getting Ready to Open Your New Inn
So much is involved in getting a new inn ready for guests that you may be 
wondering when and where to begin. There is no magical day when a particu-
lar task should be done; however, it’s best to make decisions long before the 
time to implement them arrives. In this section, I lead you through the impor-
tant task of naming your B&B, and then I point out some other items that 
should be on your to-do list, including hosting a grand opening.

97
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
Naming your B&B
What’s in a name? The simple answer is everything! It’s your inn’s identity, 
and just hearing it should evoke a positive image for potential guests and the 
media. Choosing a name for your B&B requires careful thought. In addition to 
sounding right and conveying the right meaning, the name should be easy to 
say, easy to remember, and, when it makes sense to do so, contain keywords 
that can help your Web site place highly in the results of Internet search 
engines such as Google and Yahoo! (See Chapter 8 for details on Web site 
designers who specialize in bed & breakfast Web site promotion and can help 
you select a name that will help your placement in the search engines.)
Picking your inn’s name
Naming your inn is your single best chance to create an image of your B&B 
and to share that vision with guests. Things to consider when choosing the 
name for your bed & breakfast are
 
✓ Making it easy to remember. It’s hard to get referrals if people can’t 
remember the name of your inn.
 
✓ Reflecting your geographic location. Including your geographic loca-
tion in your inn’s name lets guests know where you’re located and could 
give you an edge when guests do a search for bed & breakfasts in your 
area. A nice example is Hermann Hill Inn in Hermann, Missouri.
 
✓ Using descriptive keywords that people may use in online searches. 
Keywords are descriptive words that guests and media may use in 
Internet search engines when looking for a B&B. Including a keyword 
in your inn’s name, such as Gettysburg Battlefield Bed & Breakfast Inn, 
tells potential guests something about your inn before they’ve even seen 
your Web site.
 
 Don’t overlook the importance of the term “bed & breakfast” in your 
name, because many guests prefer to stay at B&Bs as opposed to hotels 
and use the term “bed & breakfast” in their Internet searches.
 
✓ Appearing early in alphabetical listings. Choosing a first word starting 
with a letter as early in the alphabet as possible is a good idea because 
phone books, many guidebooks, and some Internet sites still list proper-
ties alphabetically. Don’t limit yourself by the alphabet, however. If you 
have an idea for a name that meets other favorable characteristics in 
this list, forego the alphabetical concern.
Get name suggestions from everyone you know and add them to your own 
list of favorites. Then try to picture your B&B with each name that you like. 
Imagine other people talking about your inn using the names you like best. 
You may be able to narrow down your list considerably with this exercise.

Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Remember, your B&B’s name is a very important statement about your busi-
ness and will be with you a long time, so take your time in deciding.
 
Practice saying each name candidate many times, over and over. How does it 
sound to you? “Good morning, the Winding Road End of Your Journey Bed & 
Breakfast Inn, this is Sue, how may I help you?” If you say it over and over and 
it’s a mouthful, it’s probably not a good name.
Protecting your identity
After you’ve narrowed down your choices and picked the name for your bed 
& breakfast, you need to be sure that no one else has rights to it and take 
steps to protect it before you start using it. As you build your business, you 
also build your brand and your reputation, so you want to be sure that you 
own this identity as securely as any other aspect of your business. Follow 
these steps for establishing and protecting your inn’s name and identity:
 
1. Perform an online search of your potential name.
 
 Start by typing the name you’ve chosen into your favorite search engine 
and see whether other B&Bs come up. Are any nearby inns already 
using this name, or does anyone else’s marketing use the terms in your 
potential inn name? As long as any inns that appear in the search results 
don’t use the exact name, you can proceed. Don’t skip this step. If you 
find another inn using the same name, even if it’s located clear across 
the country, I strongly suggest that you start over and spend some time 
trying to find a more unique name for your bed & breakfast. True, many 
B&Bs have the same or similar names, but that always leads to confusion.
 
2. Register your inn’s name as a Web site address.
 
 When you’ve settled on a name that you don’t think anyone else is 
using, you need to immediately register it for your Web site address. 
(See Chapter 8 for information on Web sites and Internet terminology.) 
Domain registrars (such as www.godaddy.com and www.dotster.com) 
tell you whether the name you want to register is available, along with 
the extension options (.com, .net, .info, and so on). If your name is taken, 
the company offers suggestions of similar names. If you’re still in con-
tract on an existing inn, register the domain name under your current 
address. You can update it after closing.
 
 Don’t settle for a domain name that’s similar but has a hyphen or under-
score, because guests won’t remember to type these in and will end up 
visiting the other inn’s Web site. Also, if you love the domain name and 
the .com extension is being used by another inn; don’t settle for the .net 
name. If you do, chances are you’ll end up helping to promote the other 
B&B instead of yours.

99
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
 
 If you’re unsure about which domain name and extension you want to 
use, spend the money to register several possible domains, and always 
register the .com extension as well as the .net and .info extensions to 
protect your identity.
 
 When you decide on your inn name and register your domain name, reg-
ister any common misspellings as well.
 
3. If you’ll be using the inn’s name to run the business instead of your 
company name (for a limited liability company [LLC] or corporation) 
or your own name (if you’re a sole proprietor), check with your state 
to find out whether you have to register a DBA (doing business as).
 
 For example, your B&B is the Grasshopper Inn, but your business may 
actually be Smith Hospitality LLC, or just John Smith.
Taking care of important details
Use the time leading up to opening day for tackling the following important 
tasks:
 
✓ Take a food handler class. Complete any training and certification 
required for handling food and/or serving alcohol. ServSafe (www.
servsafe.com) is the most popular program accepted by most health 
departments.
 
✓ Get to know your neighbors, the area, and contacts at city hall. Spend 
time in the area getting to know your neighborhood and area attrac-
tions. Even if you already live in the area, look at it in a different light, 
getting to know other local businesses and attractions that you’ll be 
referring guests to. Also visit the chamber of commerce and/or visitors 
bureau and become a member.
 
✓ Start your marketing plan. It’s never too early to plan your advertising 
because with a new inn, you’re starting at square one. You’re building 
more than a physical property; you’re building a business, and both 
processes should happen simultaneously. Work through all the advice in 
Chapter 8 so that you’re building awareness and excitement about your 
inn while the inn itself is being built (or renovated).
 
✓ Join your national, state, and local B&B associations.
 
✓ Choose and learn software programs. Learn how to use your soft-
ware programs, and train anyone else who may be using them as well. 
(Chapter 6 has information on accounting programs, reservations sys-
tems, and property management software.)
 
✓ Plan your open house. End every conversation with locals by getting 
their contact information so that you can invite them to your open 
house to celebrate your grand opening.

Part II: Transitioning from Inn Goer to Inn Owner 
Showing off the place: Holding 
an open house
Opening your doors to guests is a big deal, and you should make the most of 
your first and biggest chance for publicity. Most innkeepers know to hold an 
open house, but the majority are surprised by the huge turnout they receive. 
Don’t underestimate the local interest in touring the place. Here are some 
tips and guidelines for holding a successful open house and making the most 
of this promotional opportunity:
 
✓ Planning and logistics
 
• There’s no right or wrong time to hold your open house; how-
ever, Sunday from 1–5 p.m. is often a good choice in terms of 
guest and local availability.
 
 Picking a date for an open house is tricky when you’re not sure 
construction will be completed. In reality, construction runs late, 
and the time allocated to furnish and decorate the inn is com-
pressed into a few days. If you’ve taken advance reservations, 
you’re working hard to open those rooms in time for your guests. 
Waiting a few weeks until after you’re open and a bit settled to 
host an open house ensures that the community sees the property 
complete and as you want them to see it.
 
• Let the local newspapers, TV stations, and radio stations know 
about the event ahead of time. As soon as you pick the date for 
your open house, get the word out by sending out invitations and/
or a press release (four to six weeks notice is ideal). Then make a 
personal call to follow up with the local media. This is a great way 
to introduce yourself to them, and it ensures that they have your 
open house information. Local media outlets often cover items of 
local interest for free. If you can get a local paper to cover the open 
house for a story before it takes place, you’ll have a much better 
turnout at a much better price than placing an advertisement. (You 
can’t beat the price of free publicity!)
 
• Ask your local chamber of commerce and visitors bureau for 
assistance in promoting the event, and invite representatives to 
attend. Introducing your inn to your local chamber of commerce 
and visitors bureau and engaging their help and support to pro-
mote your B&B early in the inn ownership process is a great prac-
tice. Your open house is a logical place to start if you’re a member 
of these organizations.
 
✓ Invitations
 
• Begin making your invite list as soon as you begin planning your 
bed & breakfast. Keep the contact information for everyone you 
meet from the time you decide to open your bed & breakfast to 
when you send out the invitations.

101
 Chapter 5: Starting a New Inn from Scratch 
 
• Postcards with a picture of the inn on the front make nice invita-
tions. Order a lot!
 
• Invite local officials and, if your inn is a historic property or in a 
historic district, historians to attend.
 
• Send personal invitations to your neighbors.
 
✓ Execution
 
• Serve simple refreshments (baked goods and soft drinks are 
fine), but have more refreshments than you think you’ll need. 
Plan on more people attending than you expect, especially if you 
get a write-up ahead of time in the local papers. Inns expecting a 
small turnout, even in remote areas, have reported attendance of 
hundreds of visitors.
 
• Hold a drawing for a free night’s stay. On the entry cards, col-
lect e-mail addresses and ask permission to put attendees on your 
newsletter list, which starts your e-mail list. (Chapter 15 has tips 
on writing newsletters, which serve as a continuous link to guests 
and potential guests).
 
• Set up racks of business cards and brochures out in the open.
 
• Make a nice display advertising the sale of your inn’s gift 
certificates.
 
• Clearly designate a bathroom for open house guests to use.
 
• Have tour guides give frequent guided tours during the open 
house. Family and friends are ideal for the job of tour guide, 
because they’ve heard the details about your inn for months. Be 
sure at least one person is available to mingle with guests who are 
waiting for the next tour or have completed a tour.
 
 Don’t let open house guests wander through the B&B unescorted, 
because things can easily disappear. Also, people tend to move 
things around, lay on the beds, and use the bathrooms, requiring 
them to be cleaned and straightened repeatedly. Affix ribbons across 
open doors to keep people out of rooms but still allow them to see 
inside. (You may have seen this done at historic homes or museums.)
 
• If you have a gift shop, include it on the tour. Make sure that 
items are prominently displayed so that local people know that 
they can shop for gifts at your B&B in the future.
 
• Make sure your private innkeeper’s quarters are locked and 
inaccessible.
 
You may want to hold an “Open House Week” or an “Open House Weekend” with 
set hours rather than limit the event to just one day, so that people have more 
opportunities to visit your property and see what you have to offer. Your goal is 
to introduce your inn to as many people as possible and to get them inside your 
inn while you still have some free time before your business gets rolling along.

Getting Ready 
for Guests

In this part . . .
O
pening your B&B for business requires some 
serious preparation. This part helps you to take 
your business through the process of getting ready to 
welcome guests, starting by establishing good record-
keeping procedures from the start and setting your room 
rates and polices. You also find out how to attract guests 
by getting the word out through marketing, including 
your Web site, and tactics that improve your placement 
in search engine results. Comfortable, appropriate fur-
nishings and good food help you to create a fabulous 
experience for your guests, so I cover them in this part 
as well. And throughout the part, I give you tips and 
secrets used by other successful innkeepers.

Chapter 6
Organizing Your Record-Keeping
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the business virtues of good record-keeping
▶ Establishing financial records
▶ Working with a property management software system
G
ood records are the core of your business. They track your financial 
performance, and they’re the information you use to analyze your suc-
cesses and disappointments throughout the life of your bed & breakfast. 
Your financial records are the framework for the organization of the day-to-
day running of your bed & breakfast, and they help you keep track of every-
thing from guest reservations to housekeeping tasks.
In this chapter, you find out just how important good record-keeping is and 
how to set up organized and useful records from the start. I tell you how to 
set up your financial and accounting records to track revenue and expenses 
as well as how to pick property management software that tracks reserva-
tions, guest communications, and even inventory controls. Good records are 
invaluable, so the software packages that help you keep your information 
organized are some of the most important tools of your business and some of 
the most important investments you’ll make in your business.
You Need Good Records, 
Plain and Simple
Setting up good record-keeping from the start is essential to the organiza-
tion of your business and will save you valuable time in the future, so this is 
an area to give considerable thought to and a good time to draw upon the 
experiences of other innkeepers (see Chapter 1 for information on finding 
innkeeper resources). Think of your records as a snapshot of your business 
performance and an objective evaluation of how it’s doing. You’ve heard the 
expression, “Numbers don’t lie.” Keep good records and you’ll have strong, 
accurate tools to gauge your business’s performance. More importantly, 
you’ll have valuable information to help you plan your future.

106
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Good records are an important part of your business for many reasons. 
Following is just a sampling:
 
✓ Good records arm you with the necessary information to file your 
income taxes and required reports such as payroll taxes (FICA), unem-
ployment taxes (FUTA and state), disability, workers compensation, 
and sales taxes. Whether you prepare these reports and filings yourself 
or give the job to your CPA or accountant, you save yourself time and 
money if the financial information is organized and at your fingertips.
 
✓ Good records allow you to see where your money goes and what areas 
it comes from. When you keep good records you know what it costs to 
provide services and amenities to guests. You won’t be profitable if you 
offer services and amenities that cost more than the revenue that they 
bring in. Knowing how much revenue each area of your business brings 
in helps you to plan accordingly so you can focus on the areas that bring 
in the most revenue. For example, it doesn’t make financial sense to con-
vert a guest room into a space for spa treatments if doing so would show 
less profit (revenue minus expenses) than using the space as a rentable 
guest room.
 
✓ Your records contain the information needed to determine which 
marketing sources are paying for themselves, which helps you make 
informed decisions about which advertisements and memberships to 
renew. (See Chapter 15 for more information on analyzing your adver-
tising results.) You can track referrals in most property management 
software systems (for more information, see the section, “Choosing a 
Property Management System,” later in this chapter) by recording the 
source of each guest referral (for example, the chamber of commerce, a 
specific online directory, past guest, repeat guest, direct mail, and so on). 
Then when it’s time for renewal you can compare the renewal price with 
the amount of business the source has generated for you. The result tells 
you whether that marketing source warrants a future investment.
 
✓ Looking at your revenue and expenses and comparing them to other 
periods helps you to predict future business and prepare for it. For 
example, if you look back over last year’s records and see that your rev-
enue from small group meetings increased during the first three months 
of the year (typically a slow period for your B&B), you may proactively 
decide to advertise your business meeting facilities to local businesses 
in the coming year’s first quarter. Your accounting software enables you 
to compare previous periods to current periods.
 
✓ Buyers can’t evaluate your business without good financial records, and 
they need reliable numbers to be able to make an educated decision 
and obtain financing to buy your inn. Seeing as you’re reading this book, 
selling your B&B is probably not even on your mind. However, the time 
may come or something unexpected (good or bad) may cause your plans 
to change and you may decide to sell your inn. Having kept consistently 
good and accurate records will make the whole process much easier.

107
 Chapter 6: Organizing Your Record-Keeping 
 
Record everything accurately, and always put yourself in a buyer’s shoes 
when considering your records. If you were to hear, “Our revenue is actually 
higher. We just didn’t record everything for tax purposes” as a buyer, you 
would wonder what else wasn’t recorded or what else the seller isn’t being 
truthful about. And, by the way, understating revenue is against the law.
Setting Up Your Books
It’s never too early to set up your books and keep track of expenses that you 
incur. No matter where you are in the process of starting your bed & break-
fast, you’re incurring expenses, so speak with your CPA or accountant about 
what business-related expenses you should be keeping track of and how to 
record them. It’s tempting to throw your receipts into a box and think about 
dealing with them later, but with so many choices of easy-to-use accounting 
software on the market today, there’s no excuse not to have an organized 
system from the start.
Opening a business checking 
account and credit card
If you haven’t done so already, open a business checking account and apply 
for a business credit card — both in the name of your B&B. But how do 
you know what your B&B is called before you’ve either bought it or built it? 
Check with your attorney about setting up your legal entity first and using it 
as the holding company for the B&B. Then, when you open you can simply 
add the DBA (Doing Business As), which is the name of your B&B, to the 
account.
Use your business checking account and business credit card to begin a 
record of the start-up expenses associated with your business (seek the 
advice of your CPA or accountant to determine what qualifies as a business 
expense) and to begin establishing a credit rating. Most banks require evi-
dence of a business before you can open a business account, including a FTIN 
(Federal Tax Identification Number) or your social security number if you’re 
a sole proprietorship. (Chapter 3 has information on business structures.)
Picking an accounting software package
You don’t need to have a financial or accounting background to keep good 
records. You have several popular software programs to choose from that are 
easy to use for small business owners such as yourself, regardless of whether 
you have a vast knowledge of bookkeeping and accounting or none at all.

108
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
Whatever software you choose, see if you can download a trial version from 
the company Web site before you buy. Trying out the trial versions will help 
you decide which program works best for you and your business. (Quick-
Books Pro is by far the most popular software used by innkeepers.)
 
Don’t buy home accounting or home business accounting software. It’s not 
complete enough for your needs and doesn’t have the ability to produce pay-
roll. Make sure the software is for small businesses.
Your accounting software is an important tool that makes your life easier and 
saves you money. It gives you the ability to track revenues and expenses, 
produce payroll, and track and pay bills in a timely manner. It also simplifies 
matters at tax time. If you’re called upon for an audit, your records are easy 
to pull together quickly. It saves you money because you’re able to easily 
print or export your records to your CPA or accountant, saving you the 
hourly billing costs of having others pull this information together for you. 
For this reason, you may want to pick a program your CPA or accountant 
uses or is familiar with so you can easily send her your records at tax time.
Almost all accounting software offers more components than you need, but 
don’t let that frighten you. Just make sure it has these features, and you’ll be set:
 
✓ Look for a program that’s compatible with your bank and credit card 
statements. Many programs automatically import your bank and credit 
card statements, making reconciliation a snap.
 
✓ Choose a program that prints checks. Being able to print and record 
checks directly from your accounting software is a serious time-saver.
 
✓ Select a program that offers a payroll module. This feature makes it 
easy for you to handle payroll on your own, saving the expense of a 
payroll service or having your CPA or accountant do it. Plus, you avoid 
the headaches of figuring payroll out on your own because the program 
does it for you.
Creating a chart of accounts
Your chart of accounts is the list of all the accounts for your business. An 
account is a category, such as interest expense, advertising, room sales, and so 
on, into or out of which money is paid. If you think of your bookkeeping system 
as a file cabinet, then each account or category is like a file folder. Every 
account is also allocated to one of five groups: revenues, expenses, assets, 
liabilities, and equity. Once you have your chart of accounts set up, you have 
more than just an organized system, you have easy access to all your financial 
information. You will use this information to compare how your business is 
doing from month to month and year to year, to know how much you’ve paid 
a particular vendor, to find out what services bring in the most revenue, to dis-
cover what you’re spending the most money on, and so on.

109
 Chapter 6: Organizing Your Record-Keeping 
 
Your chart of accounts is the foundation of your record-keeping so you want a 
good, strong base to work from. The set-up wizard in most accounting soft-
ware recommends businesses or accounts that have to be adjusted later, and, 
depending on the software, once established, some accounts can be tricky or 
impossible to remove if you’ve entered data into them. Not only do you want 
them set up correctly from the start, but setting them up can also be an intimi-
dating process. Getting help from an accountant or industry consultant (see 
Chapter 3 for help in finding a consultant) is recommended to get you started. 
It will save you significant tax return preparation costs by ensuring that the 
information for tax returns is readily available in your accounting system at 
year-end.
Table 6-1 shows the industry-recommended chart of accounts for a B&B 
prepared by the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII; 
www.paii.com). You can use Table 6-1 as a guide in setting up the accounts 
that you’ll use to generate your income statement (also called profit and loss 
statement, or P&L). This is a report that you should refer to often to gauge 
and monitor how your business is doing, so it’s important that you’re familiar 
with the accounts that generate this report. You should consult with your 
CPA or accountant for help in setting up other financial statements, such as 
your balance sheet (see Chapter 3), which includes your assets, liabilities, 
and equity.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Setting up your chart of accounts is an evolving process because you’ll be 
continuously adding additional items that bring in revenue (for instance you 
may start selling mugs at your inn) and expenses (such as adding a new type 
of advertising). After setting up the basic accounts, you can fine-tune them 
by adding accounts, subtracting accounts, or establishing sub-accounts. For 
example, rather than booking all utilities under one utility expense account, 
you can break it into several sub-accounts, such as trash collection, gas, elec-
tric, water, sewer, and cable TV.
Breaking things down into customized sub-accounts may seem like a lot of 
work, but it’s surprisingly simple, especially if you do it as you’re paying bills. 
When your water bill comes in, create a water sub-account under utilities. 
When you pay the gas bill, create a separate gas sub-account under utilities. 
You only need to do this once, because you’ll already have the sub-accounts 
set up when subsequent bills come in. When you want to see which utili-
ties went up over the previous year, you have the information broken down 
by account, and you can tell if your utility expenses were higher this year 
because you were spending more on gas or electric than the year before. The 
more detailed information you put into your bookkeeping, the more detailed 
information you can take out of it.
If you only use a paper filing system for your accounts, which I definitely 
don’t recommend, you have to sort through receipts manually and add them 
up in order to figure out how much you’ve spent during a given time period. 
On the other hand, if you use accounting software, you simply select the 
account that you want to calculate, enter the date range that you’re analyz-
ing, and let the software run a report for you. For example, if you want to 
figure out how much you spent on food and beverages for a specific period, 
you select the account where you post your food and beverage expenses and 
simply run a report for the dates that you choose.
 
Prepare year-to-date or month-to-date comparison reports from the same 
period last year to see whether you’re on target to match or exceed the prior 
period’s performance. For example, you can see if your reservations are 
behind or ahead for this year against prior years by running an advance 
deposits report and seeing if you have more or less money on hand than at 
the same time last year. If you see the numbers are sliding, it’s time to take a 
closer look at why and maybe increase your marketing efforts to compensate 
or reduce expenses. (See Chapter 15 for tips on taking your marketing to the 
next level.)

 Chapter 6: Organizing Your Record-Keeping 
Choosing a Property Management System
In addition to having your financial records in order, it’s essential to keep 
good records of your reservations and the day-to-day operations at your inn. 
You use these records to prepare for your guests’ arrivals and to analyze 
your business’s performance from a different perspective. Your guests are 
counting on you to keep good records and be expecting them when they 
arrive; they don’t want to hear that you made a mistake and booked them in 
the same room that’s reserved for another guest.
Like hotel owners, most B&B owners use property management systems 
(PMS) software to manage their records and their reservations. You can get 
software versions tailored to the bed & breakfast industry. They take care of 
the reservations and all the record-keeping surrounding the guests’ stays in 
addition to (as the name suggests) property management, which may include 
housekeeping schedules and rate management. Property management sys-
tems are so robust and can take care of so much of the organization of your 
inn that, if you’re like most innkeepers, you’ll find it’s one of the best invest-
ments that you make.
 
Many innkeepers get confused between a property management system and 
an online availability program that manages rates, availability, and online res-
ervations. Many PMSs serve both functions; however, a lot of innkeepers use 
two different systems that interface with each other. (See Chapter 11 for infor-
mation on taking reservations online.)
Another option I discuss in this section is to keep records by hand without 
a computer. Although some innkeepers successfully keep their records by 
hand, I encourage you to thoroughly explore and pick from the myriad of 
software programs available. Maintaining good records not only helps you 
run the business, but if the day comes that you’re ready to sell your bed & 
breakfast, these systems also provide the reports that interested buyers and 
lenders want and need to see.
Deciding between desktop 
and Web-based systems
Your first consideration in selecting PMS software is whether you prefer a 
desktop or Web-based system. Table 6-2 outlines the advantages and disad-
vantages of each system.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Table 6-2 
Desktop versus Web-Based Systems
System
How It Works
Pros
Cons
Desktop
All data is stored on 
your computer and 
you have complete 
control.
No one else has 
access to guest 
information.
The computer that’s 
running your PMS 
software (usually 
the main computer 
at your inn) has to 
be running in order 
to access your data 
while traveling. 
Major problems 
occur if your com-
puter crashes — 
you won’t be able 
to access your data 
until the system is 
restored.
Web-
based
All data is hosted 
on the software 
vendor’s servers. If 
you choose this type 
of system, be sure 
you can always have 
access to download 
your information 
from the PMS’s serv-
ers. That way, if you 
later want to switch 
PMS vendors, all 
your information is in 
your possession.
Your data is 
always backed 
up, and you 
can access 
your data from 
any computer. 
Server crashes 
are unlikely, but 
if they do occur, 
most vendors 
can have you 
up and running 
on a new server 
quickly.
You rely on your 
vendor to maintain 
its servers. If the 
servers are down, 
you can’t access 
your data — but 
this would be a rare 
occurrence.
When you do your own homework on the desktop versus Web-based PMS 
debate, you’ll probably develop your own opinion on which you prefer. 
However, features, functionality, marketing decisions, and ease of use will 
probably be the determining factors in selecting your program.
Narrowing your choices based 
on general factors
 
With the number of systems out there, choosing one can be a confusing pro-
cess. Start by asking other B&B owners what system(s) they use and why they 
like them. Most innkeepers are happy to offer their opinions, so you may also 

115
 Chapter 6: Organizing Your Record-Keeping 
ask what they would change about their systems. Head to online innkeeper 
forums (see Chapter 1) to connect with your peers, or contact your state and 
local B&B associations.
When faced with many options of PMS systems, you can narrow the list 
based on whether or not programs meet the following criteria:
 
✓ Compatibility between your PMS and your online reservations and 
availability systems: If you use a separate system to manage your online 
reservations, your property management system should be able to inter-
face with this system. What this means is that when an update is made 
to one (such as an online reservation is made), the other should be 
seamlessly synchronized to avoid double work and double bookings.
 
✓ Compatibility to your accounting software: Nearly all property man-
agement systems that serve the B&B industry are compatible with 
QuickBooks Pro, and many also export data to Excel and Peachtree.
 
✓ Compatibility with consolidated availability displays: Many state and 
local B&B associations as well as online directories display availability 
and/or allow guests to make reservations. Although you don’t have to 
use the same PMS as everyone else in your association, pick one that 
interfaces with the online availability system so that you’re included 
when area availability is displayed or online reservations are offered.
 
✓ Compatibility with mobile devices: Many systems allow access from a 
cellphone or other mobile devices. This feature allows you to check avail-
ability and even manage your reservations from your cellphone when 
you’re away from the inn. Even if you don’t think you’ll use it, check for 
the compatibility of the option — you just may change your mind.
 
✓ Multi-user options: Think ahead to when your inn business grows and 
you may need to have multiple users on the software. Find out what the 
costs are for additional users and licenses.
 
 PMS and availability systems hold a lot of sensitive information. Ensure 
that others can work on your system, but keep sensitive information to 
yourself by creating access codes for different levels of usage. And don’t 
forget to back up your data.
 
✓ Cost: As with everything, costs vary widely. Some PMS vendors charge 
one-time fees for their software with the option to purchase updates and 
upgrades down the road. Some charge monthly fees, some determine 
their fees based on transactions, and still others charge annual fees. As 
with any purchase, weigh the costs with the benefits to find a program 
that can grow with your business but that also fits within your budget.
 
✓ Training, customer support, trial period, and charges for updates: No 
matter how good the system is, if you can’t use it or if it frustrates you 
and doesn’t save you time, it’s not for you. Find out how much training 
is provided for the initial set-up, the hours and cost for customer sup-
port, and the length of a trial period (if there is one) before you invest 

116
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
in the program. Because software is continuously upgraded, you also 
should know what to budget for upgrades. Ask about when the software 
was last updated and what enhancements are in development.
 
When choosing any software program, you need to think about who, in addi-
tion to yourself, will need to be trained to use the program. If you’re the only 
person who knows how to use it, what happens if you have a personal emer-
gency or are ill and can’t use the program? How easy will it be for a partner, 
friend, relative, staff, or interim innkeeper to step in and learn the functionality 
of the program? You need to plan for the smooth operation of your inn, and 
part of that planning process is to determine how the inn — and the PMS soft-
ware — will function in your absence. (See Chapter 14 for information on keep-
ing the inn open when you’re not there.)

 Chapter 6: Organizing Your Record-Keeping 
Because PMS software programs can have so many built-in features, in doing 
your research you may find a program that meets all your needs. Or you may 
discover that because many of the systems integrate with each other, you 
prefer to use one program for displaying your availability to guests and a dif-
ferent program as your property management system.
Finding software vendors 
who understand B&Bs
There are many hundreds of property management system vendors out 
there, most of whom cater to hotels and larger lodging properties. Therefore, 
their PMS software often is a bad fit for a small B&B or inn due to cost (it may 
cost many thousands of dollars, way outside the budget of most innkeepers!); 
room management (look for a system designed to manage approximately 50 
rooms); and variations in room descriptions, room booking procedures, and 
deposit and cancellation policies. Whenever possible, you should choose a 
PMS software vendor who’s familiar with the needs of bed & breakfasts and 
who devotes some or all of its efforts to serving the bed & breakfast industry 
in particular.
Good ways to find vendors who support the needs of the bed & breakfast 
industry are
 
✓ Through the Vendor Marketplace maintained by the PAII (www.
paii.org).
 
✓ By checking your state bed & breakfast association’s Web site. Many 
state B&B associations have preferred vendors who offer special deals 
to their members.
 
✓ By attending an innkeeper trade show in your area. (See Chapter 1 for 
information on innkeeper conferences where you can network, discover, 
learn, and teach about the business.) Numerous vendors attend these 
conferences, giving you the chance to take a test run of several pro-
grams in one spot. These events are excellent opportunities for you to 
test and compare several programs at once, talk to innkeepers who use 
the PMS software, and listen to the answers to questions other innkeep-
ers ask that you may not have thought of.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
Talk to the customer service department of each vendor you’re considering 
buying PMS software from. This communication gives you a good idea of how 
supportive the company is and whether it’s a good match for you based on 
your level of computer knowledge.
The following vendors currently work with hundreds of bed & breakfasts 
(some keep track of your availability and can be used alone or in conjunction 
with a PMS while others are complete property management systems, keep-
ing track of everything including your availability):
 
✓ Availability Online (www.availabilityonline.com)
 
✓ Booking Center (www.bookingcenter.com)
 
✓ Convoyant Reservation Nexus (www.resnexus.com)
 
✓ RezOvation (www.rezovation.com)
 
✓ RezStream (www.rezstream.com)
 
✓ Super Inn (www.superinn.com)
 
✓ Webervations (www.webervations.com)
Keeping records without a computer
Although in a very small minority, you’re not 
alone if you decide to bypass all software pro-
grams, or if you don’t have a computer at your 
inn. Despite the variety of software programs 
available and the customization they offer, some 
existing innkeepers resist making the switch to 
computer software to help manage their finan-
cial and reservation information.
How you decide to keep track of your money 
and guests is your own personal preference, 
and even in the age of computers and rising 
technology, some innkeepers successfully and 
quite happily keep track of things using ledgers 
and a large calendar. Some established inns 
keep all their reservation information on large 
monthly calendars and guest phone sheets 
arranged monthly in three-ring binders. The 
binders hold all the guests’ pertinent informa-
tion, such as their names, contact numbers, 
number of nights they’re visiting, why they’re 
coming to the area, any food allergies, and so 
on. These inns consistently receive rave guest 
reviews for the personal attention that they 
offer to their guests.
Most innkeepers starting out, however, do 
choose a computer system, and each year a 
growing number of innkeepers who previously 
used the ledger system switch to some form 
of computer software to manage their finan-
cial records and reservations. If you decide to 
stick to the paper method, consult with your 
accountant to set up a system that includes all 
the information you need to pull together your 
figures at tax time. (See Chapter 3 for informa-
tion on hiring an accountant who specializes in 
B&Bs.)
If you don’t use technology effectively, you’re at an 
increasing disadvantage to your competition — 
both other inns and hotels.

Chapter 7
Setting Rates and 
Establishing Policies
In This Chapter
▶ Setting your rates to maximize your income
▶ Determining the types of payment to accept
▶ Setting fair and consistent policies
Y
our bed & breakfast is a special place, where you, as the innkeeper, 
strive to make sure that your guests feel at home. Although I hope you 
enjoy innkeeping so much that it doesn’t seem like a job, it is a business, and 
you need to treat it like one. In this chapter, I give you tried-and-true advice 
for charging the appropriate rate and setting firm, fair, and consistent poli-
cies to help you maintain a full house of happy guests.
Setting Your Rates
Establishing and sticking to your room rates is an important aspect of run-
ning a B&B. Rates are simply what you charge to rent out a room. Pricing 
your rooms is a nuance that comes with experience. The rates that you set 
for your rooms are determined by what you can reasonably charge. That 
amount needs to enable you to cover your costs while keeping your rooms 
relatively full and leaving something left over for you.
 
Your rates are the income of your business and your rooms are the inventory, 
so setting rates has an immediate impact on your revenue and, thus, your pay-
check. (See Chapter 3 for information on forecasting income.)
Setting appropriate rates is important to your profitability and your long-
term success — set them too high, and you won’t have the occupancy level 
that you need to succeed. Set them too low, and you may be leaving money 
on the table. Unfortunately, there is no exact formula that I can give you to 
plug in a few numbers and — voilà — tell you what to charge. Rather, setting 

120
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
your rates is a little like cooking — a pinch of this and a smidgen of that. The 
calculation of your rates depends on many factors, including what your com-
petition is charging, your location, your amenities, the condition and size of 
your rooms, supply and demand, and, finally, your best guess.
Factoring in the basics
When setting your rates, you need to first establish your base rate. Think of 
your base rate as your break-even rate — the minimum rate that you need to 
charge in order to cover your costs. This isn’t the rate that you publish, but 
it’s one that’s appropriate for the general experience you provide guests and 
one that should allow you to meet your target revenue projections.
To find your base rate, you need to figure out how much of your start-up 
costs (if any) to allocate to each year. Your CPA, accountant, or consultant 
can help with this. Then add your annual operating costs (food, amenities, 
advertising, insurance, licenses, taxes, staffing costs [including your income 
if you’re paying yourself a salary], supplies, and so forth) and your yearly 
financing costs. Divide this figure by the number of room nights that you 
expect to book based on your estimated occupancy rate. This gives you the 
base — or average — rate you need to charge to cover your costs.
Once you’ve established your base rate, you can determine what adjust-
ments to make based on the specific amenities each room offers and, to some 
extent, what the competition is charging. For example, you may decide to 
have three different rates for your rooms based on their individual amenities, 
with all of them hovering near the price of $225.
Rates generally vary based on a number of factors:
 
✓ Day of the week: Often, weekday rates are lower because fewer people 
stay at B&Bs during the week. Thus, having a lower weekday rate 
encourages business from Sunday through Thursday nights. Weekend 
and holiday rates are often higher because the demand for rooms is 
greater. Therefore, the market bears a higher price.
 
✓ Time of the year: Most areas have, at most, three seasons: a high 
season, a low season, and a shoulder season, which is the time between 
the low and high seasons. Many inns have only high and low seasons, 
and some innkeepers keep it simple with one rate all year for each room 
(which may be lower for weeknight bookings). During high season, when 
more guests are traveling, rates are usually set at their highest. This is 
followed by shoulder season, and then low season, when you offer your 
lowest rates to attract guests. There are no specific rules for setting the 
dates that define your seasons. My best advice is to keep them simple 

121
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
your first year, and keep your seasons in line with those of other lodging 
properties in the area. You can always tweak them the following year if 
you think they should be changed.
 
✓ Room size and location: The bigger the room and the better its location 
in the inn, the higher the rate guests expect to pay.
 
✓ Type of breakfast you provide: A full breakfast warrants higher rates 
than a simple continental breakfast. Some guests may not want the com-
plimentary breakfast at all, so you may want to offer a lower rate for 
rooms that don’t include breakfast, although in some areas separating the 
food from the lodging may cause your inn to lose the B&B classification.
 
✓ Room amenities provided: Rooms with upscale amenities, such as 
whirlpool tubs, fireplaces, and king-sized beds, are usually priced higher 
than rooms without these amenities.
 
✓ Special circumstances: Many inns offer a discount for extended stays, 
and larger inns may offer a discount for group bookings. During periods 
of special events, such as festivals, parents’ visiting weekend at local 
colleges, and so forth, rates are often priced higher. This is a personal 
choice, however — many inns have numerous repeat guests during 
these events and choose not to raise their rates.
 
If you’re taking over an existing inn, you have the benefit of knowing what the 
previous owners charged and what their occupancy rate was, but you should 
still reevaluate those rates. If your goal is to increase occupancy, don’t auto-
matically assume you need to lower your rates.
 
Start by setting your published rack rates high because with today’s software, 
rates can be changed easily and quickly. Plus, it’s always easier to lower rates 
or offer a discount than it is to raise rates.
Sizing up the competition
If you simply set your room rates based on what you would like to charge or 
what you think your rooms are worth, without doing any research, you won’t 
be in business long. Guests have choices, and, to a large extent, your rates 
are dictated by what other lodging establishments in the area are charging.
 
As a general rule, when you first set your rates, they should fall somewhere in 
the mid-range of what the established properties are charging. Be comparable, 
and don’t be afraid to set the rate that reflects what you think your inn is 
worth relative to others. Remember, perception is everything.

122
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
If you know without a doubt that your inn is one of the very best in your area, 
your service is excellent, and your food is heads above other local inns, don’t 
hesitate to price your rooms at the high end of the market, even if you are the 
new kid on the block. If your prices are too low, potential guests will perceive 
your inn as being inferior to your competition.
To get a handle on what nearby bed & breakfasts are doing, you need to 
do some investigative work — yes, spy on them. It’s public information, so 
there’s nothing illicit here; it’s just good business sense. Knowing what other 
B&Bs and hotels in your area offer and charge plays an important role in your 
decisions about what to offer your guests and how much to charge.
 
Avoid the temptation to discuss specific pricing structures with the competi-
tion. Discussing pricing with competitors could be considered “price fixing,” 
which is a violation of the federal Sherman Anti-Trust Law.
To conduct your analysis:
 
1. Select at least 5 lodging establishments in your area.
 
 Your goal is to analyze what they offer guests, how much they charge, 
and how successful they appear to be. It’s best to focus on B&Bs, but 
if you’re in the fortunate position of being one of the first inns in your 
area, simply use some of the other lodging choices your guests have to 
conduct your analysis.
 
 
 Your competition may be not only surrounding inns but also those in 
another, comparable destination. Look at the rates these inns are charg-
ing, too.
 
 Don’t worry if none of the properties is an exact match to yours — they 
shouldn’t be. Remember, it’s the uniqueness and personalization of bed 
& breakfasts that make them special.
 
2. Visit each property’s Web site.
Make your rates comparable
New innkeepers are often shy about charg-
ing a rate higher than they could afford to pay 
themselves. Just because you wouldn’t eat at 
the most expensive restaurant in town doesn’t 
mean that other people aren’t willing to if they 
have disposable cash. These same guests will 
arrive at your bed & breakfast in expensive 
cars, wearing fancy clothes for their romantic 
weekend getaway. Guests look at quality lodg-
ing the same way they do other quality items in 
their lives. Guests want value and quality. When 
they receive it, they expect to pay for it, so your 
room rates should reflect the quality that you 
offer.

123
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
 
 You should be able to get a good feel for a property from its Web site, 
which is something to keep in mind when you create your own site (see 
Chapter 8). Be sure to check the availability charts of other properties 
to see their occupancy.
 
3. Make a chart of the inn’s key features.
 
 Using Table 7-1, note the number and size of rooms (whether they’re 
small rooms, suites, large rooms with separate seating areas, and so on); 
rate each inn’s location in relation to its convenience to town and major 
attractions on a scale of 1-5; record what type of breakfast they offer, if 
any; and note the most-requested amenities that they offer, such as pri-
vate baths, whirlpool tubs, fireplaces, and free wireless Internet.
 
 Your chart should be tailored to your area, including things that your 
potential guests are likely to want. For example, if you’re in an urban 
area, parking may not be important but proximity to public transporta-
tion may be.
 
4. Evaluate the inn’s parking situation.
 
 At several different times during the day and evening, drive by each 
property and survey not only how busy they appear to be by the cars 
parked outside, but also note whether ample parking is available for 
guests. (For most urban inns, parking isn’t a consideration.) Add that 
information to Table 7-1 as well.
 
5. Complete the information in Table 7-1 for your own B&B as well.
 
 Creating a sample chart like Table 7-1 can help you visualize where your 
bed & breakfast fits in as compared to other inns and lodging choices 
guests have in your area.
Evaluating the competition
You can glean information about your competi-
tors in two ways: by freely sharing information 
with other innkeepers in your area, and by get-
ting a leg up on information by doing your own 
investigative work.
 ✓ Communicating openly: In many communi-
ties, innkeepers join together to form local 
lodging associations (see Chapter 1). Seek 
out and join such a group, or, if none exists, 
start one of your own. The goal of these 
groups is usually to bring guests to the area, 
which benefits everyone. Innkeepers may 
also share their concerns and solutions 
with each other at these meetings. If a par-
ticular innkeeper offers to help you with 
something, express your appreciation with 
a thank-you note, cookies, or flowers.
 ✓ Doing your homework: Stay informed by 
signing up for all your competitors’ news-
letters (use a personal e-mail address that 
they won’t recognize). This can allow you to 
find out about specials they offer, monitor 
how much discounting they do, get an idea 
of the packages they create, and basically 
get the gist of their marketing plans.

 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
 
Keep an eye on the competition, but don’t become obsessed with them. 
Analyze, monitor, and get ideas from them, but don’t follow them to the letter. 
Be unique and bring your new ideas to the area as a leader. Your success is 
defined by you, so don’t be afraid to try what makes sense to you. You can 
always adjust your rates. Charging higher rates and having fewer guests could 
mean you make the same money without working as hard, plus, fewer guests 
reduce the wear and tear on the inn . . . and you.
Putting a value on what you offer
The only way to make money is by charging a fair price and maintaining a bal-
ance between what you charge, what you offer, and the cost to you of what 
you provide. (See Chapter 3 for help in forecasting your costs and expenses.) 
Charging a lower rate than your competition and offering high-end amenities 
may lead to a full house, but at what cost? You won’t be in business very long 
if you serve an expensive gourmet breakfast but charge a very low rate for 
your rooms. High-end amenities cost money, so balancing the quality of the 
guest experience with the price of your rooms is part of setting your rates.
As you move through the process of setting your rates, you’ll be adjusting 
your base rate to arrive at your rack rate per room or room type. Your rack 
rate is the official room price — one that keeps your rooms generally full and 
generates a profit. This is the rate you publish on your Web site, and the one 
on which all discounts are based.
Most likely each of your rooms, or room types, is unique. Depending on how 
you do your analysis, the price of each room or room type probably varies 
according to the season and day of the week. For example, your king room with 
a whirlpool and fireplace may be $325 in high season, $300 during your shoulder 
season, and $250 during your low season, whereas your smallest room might be 
$250 during high season, $225 during shoulder season, and $199 during your low 
season. Each of these rooms may also have a lower mid-week rate during each 
season.
 
Don’t over-complicate your pricing and make it hard on you or your staff to 
clearly communicate your rates to guests. No matter how many different 
price levels you decide to have, make sure both you and your staff are clear 
on what the rates are.
In addition to season and day of the week, here are the most important fac-
tors that affect the rates you set for your rooms:
 
✓ Size of the room: The bigger the room, the more guests expect to pay 
for it. Size can be determined not just by square footage but also by 
the number of guests the room can sleep and whether it has a separate 
seating or dining area where guests can have breakfast delivered to 

126
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
their room and eat comfortably. So if you offer two rooms with king 
beds but one has a separate eating area where guests can enjoy break-
fast, this room can be priced higher than the other king room.
 
✓ Room location and view: Guests are willing to pay more for rooms that 
are in the best location in your bed & breakfast. For example, guests are 
likely to pay a few dollars more for a king room where they only have 
to walk up one flight of steps as opposed to the same room on the third 
floor, which requires them to walk up two flights of steps. The same is 
true for rooms with a view. Guests are willing to pay more for rooms 
with a view or balcony, so you want to price these rooms higher than 
the same rooms without these features.
 
✓ Amenities: Analyze the amenities that your inn offers and compare them 
to what other accommodations in the area are offering. Today, the most 
requested amenity is a private bath, followed by fireplaces and two-
person whirlpool tubs. The more amenities a room offers, the higher the 
price you should assign to it. Thus, a room with a fireplace should be 
priced higher than the same room with no fireplace.
 
 While you don’t want to price yourself out of the market, remember many 
amenities that B&B goers take for granted are things they would pay 
extra for at a hotel, for example, Internet access, local calls, movies (if you 
offer a DVD library) and room service (if you offer the option of having 
breakfast delivered to guests’ rooms). Depending on your location, you 
may also offer the use of such things as beach chairs, umbrellas, bicycles, 
kayaks, and so forth (see Chapter 12 for information on consulting with 
your insurance agent if you plan to loan guests sporting equipment).
 
✓ Breakfast: As you calculate your rates, factor in the type of breakfast 
you serve. If you’re serving a full, sit-down breakfast with homemade, 
hot entrées, your rates should be higher than if you’re offering a light 
continental breakfast of pastries, juices, and coffee or tea.
 
✓ Locale: Many guests choose an inn specifically because of its location, 
so prime locations command a premium in pricing. If your guests can 
walk to the beach or into town, this adds value to their stay — and to 
your rooms — as compared to those of another inn further from the 
beach or town.
 
✓ Guest services: The higher your rates, the more guests will, and should, 
expect. The trick for you is to match guest expectations with your pric-
ing. Do you offer concierge-type services, such as making reservations 
or providing wake-up calls or turndown service? If so, factor this into 
your rates. On the flip side, if you set your rates high, be prepared to 
offer the types of services guests expect from higher rates.
 
When setting your rates, start by setting the rate of your smallest room first. 
Determine a rack rate for this room based on your own expenses and what 
other inns in the area are charging for a room of this size with comparable 

127
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
amenities. Work your way up by room size. Look at each room in relation to 
your smallest room. As the size increases, so should the price. Increase the 
price a bit more if the room has additional amenities, such as a fireplace.
For example, if your smallest room has a queen bed and you determine the 
price to be $150 a night, you might set the rate for your next largest room, 
which also has a queen bed, a separate seating area, and a balcony, at $175 
per night. Following this same logic, the next largest room, which has a king 
bed, separate seating area, fireplace, and two-person Jacuzzi, might go for 
$200 per night. If you offer the same king room with a balcony, the rate you 
set might be $215 per night.
Adjusting your rates
To tweak your income, maximize your revenue, and fill vacancies, factor in 
demand. Your business, like any other small business, is affected by supply 
and demand. Not just demand for your location and the amenities that you 
offer, but also demand based on when guests want to travel. Using the base 
rates that you set (see “Factoring in the basics,” earlier in this chapter), you 
adjust your rates according to when you’re most likely to be busy, charg-
ing more during peak times and setting lower rates during the week and off 
season, when fewer guests typically travel. This rate factoring technique is 
called yield management in the hospitality industry (see Chapter 15).
 
When posting your rates, always start with the lowest rate in off season and 
end with the highest rate in high season, for example, $129 to $195. By posting 
your rates in this manner, you’re more likely to capture prospective guests 
who are rate-hunting.
Mid-week and extended stays
Whether to offer different rates during the week and for multiple-night stays 
depends on your market. In periods of high demand, this usually isn’t nec-
essary, but during slow periods, it can bring in additional guests. Weekday 
rates are priced lower because fewer people stay at B&Bs during the week.
Offering special pricing for corporate travelers is another great way to fill 
mid-week vacancies. To make the most of this strategy, contact the corpora-
tions in your area and let them know about your inn and the special rates 
you’re offering for their visiting business colleagues. Find out the per diem 
rate typically allowed by corporations in your area and, if that rate is reason-
able, offer an equal rate for their out-of-town employees.
 
Consider hosting an open house so companies can feel comfortable recom-
mending your inn. See Chapter 5 for details.

128
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Seasonal demand
Adjusting your rates according to the season is not only customary but 
also expected, so don’t be afraid to do it. Think of it in terms of supply and 
demand. Remember, “high season” is called that for a reason. More potential 
guests are traveling and willing to pay a higher price for accommodations on 
valuable dates.
If you’re just starting out, set higher rates for your peak season ahead of 
time. If you’re rooms aren’t being booked as the season approaches, you can 
experiment with lowering your rates. To do this, try lowering the price on one 
room and see whether bookings pick up for that room. If not, pricing probably 
isn’t the issue, and you may want to reevaluate your marketing efforts. (See 
Chapters 8 and 15 for marketing techniques you may be missing out on.)
During peak season and on holiday weekends, consider adding a minimum- stay 
requirement. Then if your rooms aren’t being booked as the season approaches, 
you can consider relaxing this policy before lowering your rates further.
 
When setting the dates for your seasons, avoid having the season end on 
a Friday. While August 15th may seem like a reasonable date for your high 
season to end as kids head back to school, if August 15th is a Friday, it means 
weekend guests will be staying one night in high season and one night in a 
slower season. In this instance, having your high season end on August 18th 
simplifies things, plus you earn the higher rate for the whole weekend.
Holidays and special events
Many inns raise their rates when they know they will be sold out no matter 
what. For example, you can raise your rates for college graduations, sporting 
events, Fourth of July weekend, festivals, and so on. These are your must-fill 
times, so at the very least, consider imposing minimum stays and stricter 
cancellation policies during these events. (For help setting policies, see the 
section “Setting reservation policies” later in this chapter.)
Knowing when to raise or lower rates
Your rooms are your inventory, so managing your rates is managing the 
inventory of your business. When your rates are too high, your rooms sit 
empty and don’t earn income for you. When your rates are too low, you forgo 
the additional income that you could have earned by charging a higher rate 
that guests would have paid.
 
Be careful not to fall into the trap of being afraid to change your rates.
Just as there are no rigid standards for setting rates, knowing when to change 
them isn’t an exact science either. A good way to determine when it’s time 
to raise or lower your rates is to repeat the research you did when you first 

129
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
set your rates. As your business develops, you should perform this analysis 
at least once a year (see Chapter 15 for tips on how to compare your results 
with your expectations).
 
Your rates may be too high if your competition constantly seems busier than 
you are. However, lowering your rates isn’t your only option. First, try increas-
ing your marketing efforts (see Chapters 8 and 15 for valuable marketing tech-
niques), adding more amenities, or relaxing your minimum-stay policies.
Conversely, your rates may be too low. The following are clues that this is 
the case:
 
✓ Your rooms are booked far in advance. If all your rooms are booked 
months in advance, experiment with raising your rates. Start by raising 
the rate of your most popular room by 5 to 10 percent. If the room con-
tinues to book far in advance, you’re probably under-pricing your rooms 
and may want to bump them up a little.
 
✓ You seem much busier than the competition. If your parking lot is 
packed and the B&B across town seems to have plenty of extra space, or 
if you hear that you’re busier than the other bed & breakfasts in the area, 
try raising the rates on your most popular rooms. If you find this has a 
negative effect on your occupancy, you can always lower them again.
 
✓ Your occupancy rate is greater than 75 percent. The most obvious clue 
that it’s time to raise rates is a high occupancy rate. Don’t be afraid to 
mess with success. Guests are telling you you’re worth it, which means 
you’re probably worth even more, and it’s time to raise your rates.
 
No matter what rates you set, you can always change them, and you should as 
time goes on. When raising and lowering rates, you don’t have to change the 
rates for all your rooms in all your seasons. Tweak only the ones that need it, 
and leave the rest alone.
Deciding What Types of 
Payment to Accept
Getting paid by guests who stay in your rooms is the main goal of your 
business, so you need to decide what forms of payment you’ll accept. Your 
choices are cash, personal and corporate checks, traveler’s checks, and 
credit cards. Some inns accept all of these payment types, while other inns 
choose not to accept certain forms of payment, such as personal checks or 
credit cards. Whatever you decide, you need to communicate the types of 
payment you accept clearly to guests before they arrive for their stay. Doing 
this avoids embarrassing situations for guests and uncomfortable situations 
for you when guests aren’t able to settle their bill at the time of their stay 
because they don’t have a form of payment that you accept.

130
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Deciding which forms of payment to accept isn’t difficult, but it’s something 
you need to do before you can start accepting reservations. You can always 
change your mind later — it’s not uncommon for an inn to add or drop a par-
ticular form of payment.
 
If you decide to change your policy regarding the forms of payment you 
accept, be sure to update your staff, all directories, all your advertising, your 
Web site, your brochure and rack cards, your reservation software, and any-
thing else that lists the types of payment accepted.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of cash and checks
In an effort to avoid the fees associated with accepting credit cards, some 
innkeepers decide to limit the forms of payment they accept to personal 
checks, traveler’s checks, and cash. Other innkeepers prefer not to accept 
cash or checks. To help you evaluate these types of payments, Table 7-2 lists 
some of the pros and cons of each.

Accepting credit cards
Most B&Bs today accept credit cards for guest convenience and to take 
deposits on future reservations. While you don’t have to accept credit cards, 
you should be aware that most guests prefer to pay by credit card, and not 
giving them this option may result in lost business. Many innkeepers start 
out not accepting credit cards because they want to avoid paying the asso-
ciated fees. You may be able to get away with this if your room rates are 

131
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
relatively inexpensive, if your market does not include business travelers, or 
if your typical guest books far enough in advance to have time to send in a 
check for a deposit. However, the higher the amount of the guests’ bills, the 
more likely they are to want to charge it on their credit card, and corporate 
travelers almost always either prefer or are required to pay by credit card.
Becoming a merchant
In order to accept credit cards, you need to be set up as a merchant. Being a 
merchant means you are authorized to accept credit cards through a credit 
card processor, which is the entity that you submit your credit card transac-
tions to in order to be paid. Here are some ways to find a credit card processor:
 
✓ Go to your bank. Most local banks can either be your credit card pro-
cessor or help you set up a relationship with one.
 
✓ Ask around. Ask your local or state bed & breakfast association, local 
chamber of commerce, other innkeepers, or other small business 
owners for recommendations.
 
✓ Check with your property management software provider. The soft-
ware you use may have the capability of processing credit cards. If not, 
the vendor may be able to help you set up an account with a processor 
that they use.
 
✓ Look into wholesale warehouses. Several of the wholesale warehouses 
that offer small business services, such as Costco, offer credit card pro-
cessing services.
 
✓ Contact the Professional Association of Innkeepers International 
(PAII). The association maintains a list of credit card processors who 
specialize in providing services to bed & breakfasts. You can visit the 
association’s Web site at www.paii.org, click Resources, then Vendor 
Marketplace, and then Credit Card Services.
 
Shop around and compare rates among processors. Ask each credit card pro-
cessor you are considering for an itemized list of all fees, such as monthly 
maintenance fees and per-transaction fees. (Typically transaction fees are 
higher when you do not swipe the guest’s credit card and on corporate cards.)
The credit card processor you ultimately choose will give you a merchant 
application to fill out. Don’t be surprised if you’re asked to provide a per-
sonal guarantee when filling out this application. In this case, your personal 
credit history is checked and you are guaranteeing that you will pay all out-
standing fees when the account is closed. Some credit card processors may 
also require you to fill out a Lodging Addendum, which allows you to charge 
credit cards for advanced deposits. Questions on a typical merchant agree-
ment include the average size of the transactions you will process, how many 
years you’ve been in business, the type of services you’ll be providing, your 
cancellation policy, and so forth.

132
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
When you’re approved as a merchant, you enter into a merchant agreement 
with the credit card processor. This document spells out all the terms of 
your agreement, such as fees (including any early termination fees) and when 
and how you will receive your money.
Processing guests’ credit cards
A terminal is the mechanism used to process credit cards. If you have a phys-
ical terminal, which is the type used by most B&Bs, you process your guests’ 
charges in one of two ways:
 
✓ Swiped transactions: You swipe the guest’s card in the terminal to 
record the charge.
 
✓ Keyed transactions: You manually enter the guest’s credit card numbers 
into the terminal.
 
If you have a physical terminal, swiped transactions are the way to go because 
these transactions usually result in lower processing charges. For this reason, 
some innkeepers take the guest’s credit card number when making a reserva-
tion, but don’t process the full amount until the time of the guest’s stay, when 
they can swipe the card.
If you require your guests to make deposits in advance of their stays, you 
have no choice but to process these as keyed transactions or virtually 
through your reservation software. Innkeepers who require such prepay-
ments consider the credit card merchant fees on these transactions as 
simply another cost of doing business.
Settling transactions and getting paid
When you run a guest’s credit card through your system, you are usually 
receiving authorization for the transaction and the amount. You are not 
actually charging the guest’s credit card. This is usually done at the end of 
each day, when all credit cards are settled at once. Settling your charges is a 
simple step in the credit card processing system — usually an automatic pro-
cess or just the push of a button.
 
Settle all transactions each day to avoid additional surcharges. Most credit 
card processors charge a higher rate if you don’t settle a transaction on the 
same day that you run it through your system.
Under most circumstances, you receive the money for a charge as a direct 
deposit into your bank account within 24 to 48 hours of settling the transac-
tion. Visa, Mastercard, and Discover usually credit the full amount of the 
charge to you initially, and then automatically deduct the fees in one lump 
sum from your bank account (and send you an itemized statement) at the 
end of the month. Depending on your arrangement with American Express, 
their fees may be either deducted with each settlement batch or deducted as 
a lump sum at the end of the month.

133
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
 
Credit cards are a very effective way to take a deposit for future reservations. 
Guests often view having to mail a check in ahead of their stay as inconvenient 
and impractical.
Creating Clear Policies
Setting fair and consistent policies is good for you and all your guests. Such 
policies take away any uncertainty guests may have about what is accept-
able, and policies help you ensure that no guests infringe on the rights of 
others during their stays.
Guests may want to live by the old adage that rules are meant to be broken, 
but it’s your job to set and enforce policies that ensure your inn runs 
smoothly. Parents who are escaping for a romantic weekend may have specif-
ically chosen your inn because of your policy that the inn is for adults only. 
If they have chosen to leave their kids at home to enjoy a child-free weekend, 
they won’t appreciate your bending the rules to allow another couple to 
bring their baby. You may be tempted to try to make everyone happy, but 
consistently abiding by your policies is better.
Lowering your credit card fees
Accepting credit cards comes with a price, but it 
doesn’t have to be an exorbitant one. Following 
are some tips to help you minimize the fees you 
pay for the privilege:
 ✓ Consider buying rather than leasing your 
terminal. This is generally a better deal, but 
do the math to be sure.
 ✓ Ask questions about your statement. Make 
time to call your credit card processor and 
ask them to explain any charges you don’t 
understand.
 ✓ Settle transactions daily. Find out whether 
you can avoid surcharges by doing so.
 ✓ Understand the difference between quali-
fied and non-qualified rates. Submitting a 
customer’s address and the security code 
on his credit card usually qualifies you for 
the qualified rate, which is the lowest rate 
the credit card processor offers.
 ✓ Know how to contest chargebacks. A 
chargeback is when a guest disputes 
a charge on his credit card statement. 
Chargebacks are most common for no-
show charges, cancellation fees, and 
damage charges. The credit card company 
investigates to determine whether the 
guest should receive his money back. Ask 
how chargebacks are handled and how 
to protect yourself from them. Knowing in 
advance the types of policies and docu-
mentation required can give you a stronger 
argument when contesting chargebacks.

134
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Consider the following when setting your policies:
 
✓ Make a note of which policies you like and which ones you dislike when 
you stay at other inns.
 
✓ Look at the policies of other inns in your area on their Web sites or rack 
cards and brochures. Don’t copy them, but use them as a guideline. 
Your inn is unique, so your policies should be too. However, it’s okay to 
learn from others who may have thought of something that you didn’t.
 
✓ Only institute policies that you are comfortable with.
 
✓ Make sure the wording of your policies doesn’t discriminate against any 
individual or group and is clear, simple, concise, and consistent. Have 
your lawyer review your policies for these factors, as well as to be sure 
they don’t discriminate against any individual or group.
 
✓ Consult your credit card processing company to determine ahead of 
time the steps you need to take in order to charge guests fees for late 
check-outs, no shows, cancellations, damages, and so forth.
 
✓ Include your policies in all written or published material about your 
inn. Post your policies on your Web site, on all your online directory 
advertisements, and on your rack cards or brochures. Relay important 
policies to guests when taking their reservations and include them in the 
confirmation letters you send. Giving guests a variety of places to refer 
to your policies helps to protect you from unhappy guests who would 
rather disregard your policies.
 
✓ Develop a room brochure outlining your inn’s policies. You can do this 
by creating a guest directory which not only includes your inn’s policies 
but also other information that guests will find useful during their stay, 
such as information about area activities, restaurants, and so on.
 
✓ State the consequences of willfully ignoring or breaking a policy in writ-
ing, where appropriate. For example, you might state, “We have a No 
Smoking policy. Guests who smoke in their rooms will be asked to check 
out immediately, and a $250 charge will be assessed to the credit card 
on file. This amount is to cover the cleaning charges incurred in render-
ing the room smoke-free for subsequent guests.”
 
Reading off your entire list of policies during the phone reservation process 
sounds militant. You should, however, mention any important or particularly 
relevant policies during the conversation. For example, you might say, “We’re 
a non-smoking inn, and a full hot breakfast is served at 9 a.m.” or “Your 
puppy sounds adorable, but I want to be sure you know that we’re not able to 
accommodate pets.”

135
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
Setting reservation policies
Reservation policies protect both your guests and your income. When you 
take reservations from guests, you are committing to having rooms for them 
and they are committing to come and pay for those rooms. The following sec-
tions give you some ideas about how to set and uphold deposit, cancellation, 
and minimum-stay policies.
Deposit policies
No standard deposit amount exists in the bed & breakfast industry. The 
deposit can vary from a dollar amount to a percentage of the reservation. 
Usually, the longer the reservation is for or the greater the number of rooms 
reserved, the greater the deposit. The deposit serves to solidify the com-
mitment between you and the guest. When guests aren’t willing to give you 
a deposit, it usually means they’re not serious about their plans, and you’re 
better off with a reservation from a guest you can rely on.
The following is an example of a well-written deposit policy:
To guarantee your reservation, a deposit of 50 percent is required for a stay 
of two or more nights, except for the months of July and August, when a 100 
percent deposit is required. A 100 percent deposit is also required for one-
night stays. The balance due at checkout may be paid by cash or credit card.
Cancellation policies
These policies can vary depending on how far in advance the reservation 
is cancelled, how many nights the reservation was for, and the number of 
rooms it was for as well as the seasonal time of year. Your policy should 
allow you a reasonable period of time in which to re-rent the room.
Here is an example of a clearly written cancellation policy:
Should you wish to cancel or change your reservation for any reason, we 
require at least 14 days’ advance notice (21 days during Tanglewood and 
Foliage Seasons and New Year’s Eve for New Year’s weekend when New 
Year’s Eve falls on a Friday or Saturday night, and 28 days for groups of 3 or 
more rooms) by telephone. With at least 14 (21) days’ notice, we will refund 
your deposit, less a service charge of 10 percent of your total reservation. 
Cancellations made within the 14-day (21-day) period will be charged for 
the full amount of the reserved stay unless we are able to rebook the room. 
If we are able to rebook the room, we will refund the rebooked portion, less 
the 10 percent service charge. We are a small inn, and cancellations affect 
us dramatically. If you have any concerns about possibly having to cancel, 
we recommend inexpensive trip cancellation insurance. This inn is in the 
Berkshires, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where 
Tanglewood and fall foliage are very popular attractions. We project and 
count on high occupancy during these periods.

136
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Minimum-stay requirements
Many innkeepers have a minimum stay requirement (remember, more clean-
ing is required when a guest checks out than on days the guest remains 
in the room). At the very least, you should be able to fill your rooms with 
two-night stays on weekends during periods of high demand. If you grant a 
Saturday-night-only reservation, you may find it difficult to fill the Friday-
night-only vacancy, and in the meantime, you’re likely to be turning away 
guests who would have booked the entire weekend. If you find you’re not fill-
ing the rooms, you can always relax this policy.
A policy such as the following makes the minimum-stay requirements during 
periods of high demand clear to guests:
There is a three-night minimum stay on Tanglewood Season weekends 
as well as on most holiday weekends. There is a two-night minimum stay 
for midweek stays during Tanglewood and Foliage Seasons. Weekends 
during Tanglewood Season are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
There is a two-night minimum stay on weekends, excluding holiday week-
ends, from Labor Day through late June.
Check-in and check-out policies
As excited as you are to welcome guests, waiting until 11 p.m. for them to 
check in when you have to get up at 6 a.m. to start breakfast isn’t fair to 
you. It’s also not fair to you or the next guests checking in for guests to stay 
past the check-out time, as this makes it difficult (if not impossible) for you 
to have the room ready for your arriving guests. Having clear check-in and 
check-out policies and sticking to them helps.
 
✓ Setting a check-in policy: Set a window of time for guest check-ins, and, 
when possible, have someone available to greet guests during this period. 
(See Chapter 12 for handling late arrivals). When you take reservations, 
ask your guests what time they plan to arrive. Ask them to kindly give you 
advance notice if their plans change and they find they won’t be arriving 
at either the agreed-upon time or during your check-in period.
 
✓ Setting your check-out policy: Set a check-out time that allows you 
enough time to clean and ready the room for the next guest. Stick to 
this time. You may offer to hold guests’ bags or, if the room is not being 
rented to a new guest, consider charging a half-day rate. While this may 
sound greedy, if a last-minute guest were to call needing a room, you’d 
have to turn her away, missing out on the full night’s rate, so charging a 
half-day rate is a small consolation. When guests think there’s a charge 
for late check-outs, they’re more likely to take your policy seriously and 
stick to your check-out time.
 
One way to help ensure that guests remember the check-out time is to remind 
them of it upon their arrival. While this may seem inhospitable, many sea-
soned innkeepers make it a common practice to do so as they verify the rest 
of the reservation with the guest.

137
 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
Establishing general policies
When you put together your general policies, consider the protection of your 
inn, the safety and comfort of your guests, and your sanity. You need to be 
sure your policies are fair and consistent, and don’t discriminate against any 
individual or group.
Guidelines concerning children
We were all kids ourselves, but not all inns are appropriate for children. If 
your B&B is full of antiques, has a steep drop off a cliff in the backyard, or is 
known for romantic escapes, children are probably inappropriate, and this 
should be clearly stated in your policies. Policies regarding children range 
from excluding children of all ages to allowing only those over a certain 
age. Before crafting such policies, you should consult with your attorney, as 
specifically prohibiting children could be considered discrimination. A well-
thought-out policy regarding children not only protects the inn but also helps 
both parents with children (how can anyone relax with priceless breakables 
within reach of little hands?), and guests looking for a romantic getaway.
Pet policies
Welcoming pets is not the norm at most B&Bs, so if you decide you can 
accommodate pets in some or all of your rooms, be sure to set clear policies 
for the guests who bring them and for the benefit of visitors who may not be 
fond of pets. Let everyone know what the policy is, including where pets are 
and are not allowed in the inn. Additionally, make guests aware of any extra 
cleaning fee, which is usually charged for accommodating pets.
 
If you have pets of your own and they interact with guests, this should be 
posted on your Web site. Many guests are allergic to or afraid of animals. Take 
the cue from the guest, and don’t assume everyone loves friendly Fido as 
much as you do.
Alcohol considerations
Two issues arise with alcohol: serving it to guests and dealing with intoxi-
cated guests. States have varying regulations regarding serving alcohol to 
guests. Small B&Bs are actually businesses in private homes, and some states 
allow serving complimentary alcohol to guests — but don’t assume this is 
the case in your state. Check with your state B&B association or the ABC 
(Alcohol Beverage Control) board of your state. The logic of some states is 
that because you are charging for the room, some of those proceeds are used 
to purchase the liquor, so, in effect, you are charging for alcohol when you 
serve it, and therefore it is prohibited.

138
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Group policies
It’s wise to have separate and stringent cancellation and deposit policies 
when accommodating groups at your inn. For example, many innkeepers 
require that the group reserve the entire inn so that other guests don’t 
feel overrun by the group. Cancellation policies help protect you and your 
income if the group decides to back out at the last minute, leaving you with 
an empty inn. Additionally, you need other policies and guidelines in place 
when hosting weddings and other group events.
Other house rules
Your insurance policy dictates additional house rules and policies that you 
need to enforce, not only to ensure coverage but also for the safety of your 
guests and your inn. You can find out about policies that you may not have 
thought of by reading innkeeper forums and by talking to other innkeepers 
(see Chapter 1 for information on how to find other successful innkeepers to 
talk to). You may want to consider the following policies for the safety and 
protection of your inn:
Making serious policies sound less harsh
Many of your guests will be first time B&B 
goers who aren’t familiar with the necessity for 
different policies at a B&B versus a hotel. They 
look forward to the intimate atmosphere and 
personalization of the B&B lodging experience, 
but need to be educated on how you make this 
possible. You can begin the education process 
with a few words in your reservation policy. For 
example, an inn in the busy seaside town of 
Cape May, New Jersey, includes the following 
on their Web site:
 
 Please be sure of your plans before booking! 
As a small inn dealing almost exclusively 
with advance reservations, date changes 
and cancellations affect us significantly. 
Consequently, we require a minimum of 
two weeks advance notice of any change 
to your reservation, including a change of 
dates, change in number of nights, or can-
cellation. As long as this notice is given, 
we will refund your deposit, less a $20 pro-
cessing fee per room. Without this notice, 
deposits are not returned. The only excep-
tion will occur if we are able to re-rent the 
room/s to fill the entire original booking, at 
which time we will make the same refund 
as described above.
 
 We realize that life and the weather are 
unpredictable, but we do not assume 
responsibility for either! We ask that you 
carefully consider our policy before making 
a reservation.

 Chapter 7: Setting Rates and Establishing Policies 
 
✓ Candles: Many inn fires have resulted from guests’ use of candles. Some 
innkeepers ban candles completely; others allow only votive candles; 
and still others offer attractive, battery-operated candles as an alterna-
tive. It’s okay to blame the insurance company or fire marshal for your 
restrictions on candles.
 
✓ Incense: Many innkeepers (and other guests) are bothered by the burn-
ing of incense and prohibit incense at the inn.
 
✓ Eating in the room: Some inns offer breakfast in bed while others dis-
courage or prohibit food in the guest rooms. Don’t put furniture in the 
rooms that accommodates in-room meals unless you’re comfortable 
with guests eating in their rooms.
 
✓ Bath oils in the hot tub: Some inns don’t allow bath oils or bubbles in 
their hot tubs and others provide them. If you have hot tubs or whirl-
pool tubs in your bed & breakfast, check with the manufacturer to find 
out what can harm the tubs.
 
You want to achieve a careful balance between policies and rules that protect 
your inn and those that ensure the rights of your guests, while not making so 
many rules that guests can’t relax and enjoy their stay with you.

M
aking people aware of your inn is the most important factor in your 
business’s success. You may have the best breakfast recipes, the 
most gorgeous décor and the most luxurious guest rooms, but if potential 
guests don’t know it, you’ll have empty beds.
In this chapter, I show you how to spread the word about your bed & break-
fast when it’s new and keep the word spreading as your business grows. I 
share my favorite ideas to help you harness the power of marketing by creat-
ing an appealing image for your inn and promoting that image through the 
Internet, word-of-mouth, and print advertising.
Creating a Marketable Image
Marketing is just a fancy word for waving your own flag or tooting your own 
horn. There are many ways to get your message out, but before you can spread 
the word, you have to know what you want to say. Marketing is the art of por-
traying your B&B in the most favorable light possible and sharing that message 
with as many people as possible. Marketing is an ongoing process, which con-
sists of advertising in print and on the Web, developing positive relationships 
with guests and businesses, and showing the media why your inn is wonderful. 
Filling your guest rooms is the most important aspect of your business, so how 
you market your inn determines the success of your B&B.

142
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Deciding on your B&B’s image is the first step in beginning to market your 
business. In simplest terms, your inn’s image is how you want people to per-
ceive your bed & breakfast. Your image can be summed up by asking yourself 
the question: “If a guest were describing my inn to a friend, what would I 
want them to say?”
Maybe this phantom conversation would be “It’s a fantastic inn that’s in the 
best spot on that beach” or “It’s a wonderful B&B with the best pancakes I’ve 
ever tasted.” You could solidify that image by marketing your inn as “The 
Best Spot on the Beach” or “Home of the World’s Best Pancakes.” Your bed & 
breakfast will succeed or fail on guests’ perceptions of your image, so play to 
your strengths.
You can take one of many angles when developing your image. Your angle 
may be geographic, your theme, or it may be related to the food you serve, 
the history of your building, or a prominent feature in the area. For instance, 
The Songbird Prairie B&B is located on the edges of a very well-known bird 
sanctuary, so their image is “Where luxury and nature converse.” Here are a 
few ideas to help you decide on a marketing angle for your B&B:
 
✓ If your inn is located in an area that is known for a specific attraction, 
like a beach, lake, grand architecture, or a famous museum, make this 
the focus of your image. Consider why guests typically visit the area. 
For example, if you’re located in a town famous for its hot springs, your 
proximity to the springs may be a wonderful marketing tool.
 
✓ Make your message appeal to the type of guests you want to attract. If 
you’re trying to attract couples on a romantic getaway, you’ll be creat-
ing a different marketing image than if you want to focus on guests who 
are taking family vacations.
 
✓ Identify the characteristics of your inn that make guests want to stay 
with you, such as the fact that it’s historic, rustic, or elegant. If your inn 
is in a Second Empire home, you may want to expound on the view from 
the top of your turret or your porches that “Go on forever.”
Indentifying what makes you unique
B&B guests are looking for a unique experience, not a cookie-cutter place to 
sleep. The goal of marketing your inn is to make it stand out and appeal to 
guests so that they choose you over the many alternatives available to them. 
Accentuate what makes your inn unique, and elaborate on the features, ser-
vices, and amenities that only your B&B provides.
Of the many things that may make your inn unique, some of the most popular 
to feature in your marketing message are:

143
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
 
✓ Your inn’s personality: Historic, Victorian, modern, and so on
 
✓ Your inn’s guest list: The type of guests you’re trying to attract
 
✓ Your inn’s location: Proximity to attractions
The Gettysburg Battlefield Bed & Breakfast has nicely combined several 
unique attributes into a successful marketing plan. It’s a historic inn, which 
attracts history buffs as well as families interested in an educational trip. The 
inn is located right on the Gettysburg battlefield, so its proprietors discuss 
this unique attribute in all their marketing literature. By discerning what 
makes their B&B unique, the innkeepers are able to create an environment 
where guests don’t just learn history, they see, feel, smell, and sense the his-
tory around them. That’s their marketing angle, and because it’s unique, they 
have a very successful inn.
 
Be honest in all of your advertising! For instance, be straightforward about 
where your inn is located. You may be able to trick guests into making a res-
ervation by letting them think you’re in a popular tourist destination when, in 
fact, you’re 15 minutes outside of it. Once they arrive, however, you’ll have 
unhappy guests who’ll know they’ve been lied to. State how close you are to 
the destination. Many guests will be fine with the location, as long as they’re 
aware of it in advance.
 
Don’t forget popular tourist destinations are important search keywords that 
should be prominent in the text of your Web site.
Creating a marketing image is an ongoing process. Begin identifying the key 
parts of your message as soon as you start the planning process for your bed 
& breakfast.
Building a brand
Deciding on your brand and your inn’s message in the beginning is as impor-
tant as mapping out a long trip before your departure. Branding is creating 
and choosing the best verbal, visual, and intangible symbols to represent 
your inn’s message. Think of your inn’s brand as its personality or attitude. 
Continue to ask yourself, “What message do I want to send?” Is your B&B the 
closest one to the Grand Canyon? The one with the oceanfront location, or 
historical significance, or world-famous muffins (at least they should be)? 
Integrating these kinds of messages in all your communications is branding.
Start developing your brand by creating a tagline that incorporates your mes-
sage, and use it on business cards, stationary, rack cards, and your Web site. 
Your tagline should be simple and descriptive. A good tagline is “The closest inn 
to the Grand Canyon.” “The best B&B in St. Louis” is a weak example because it 
doesn’t convey anything special or unique about your inn — any number of bed 
& breakfasts could claim it. Stay away from anything generic or hackneyed.

144

Barbara Findlay Schenck (Wiley).
Developing a logo
Golden arches for McDonalds, a red check mark for Verizon Wireless, and 
the swoosh for Nike all represent logos which immediately bring to mind the 
brand they represent. While it would be great to have a logo equally as rec-
ognizable, the main purpose of the logo for your B&B is to communicate the 
image you want to convey about your bed & breakfast. A Web site designer 
may be willing to help with this, or you can hire an online company like 
Logoworks (www.logoworks.com) to develop a logo for your inn.
Creating the right graphic image to symbolize your brand is a process that can 
be very time consuming, but it’s extremely important and will have a lasting 
effect on your business. A good way to get started is to sketch out numerous 
logo designs and solicit as many opinions as possible. An effective logo is one 
that’s
 
✓ Communicative: Your logo should communicate and reinforce your 
brand image and marketing message.
 
✓ Simple: The simpler the logo is, the easier it is for the brain to process 
and remember it.
 
✓ Inspirational: You want the logo to produce a good feeling when viewed 
by potential guests.
 
✓ Memorable: Your logo should help guests remember the name of your inn.
 
✓ Reproducible: Pick a design that will look good on your Web site, your 
stationary, clothing and gift items (shirts and mugs), and in print. A 
good logo can be scaled to many different sizes and reproduced without 
color for black-and-white printing.
Marketing on the Internet
Show me a successful new inn and I’ll show you a strong Internet presence. 
Marketing on the Internet is essential when you’re starting a new inn, and it’s 
probably the single easiest way to build your business if you’re taking over 
an established B&B. Nowhere will you get a bigger bang for your buck or 
your effort than on the Internet. The Internet puts small properties on a level 
playing field with larger accommodations, making it one of the best things to 
happen to the bed & breakfast industry.

145
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
Working with a Web site
Web sites are a must-have in the lodging industry. Your Web site is your 
online brochure, potentially delivered to millions of prospective guests 
around the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The cost is 
nominal in comparison to the benefits it provides.
Whether you decide to have your site professionally designed or create it 
yourself, the best way to get started is to spend time researching other Web 
sites and compiling a list of sites you like and why. Your Web site should be 
easy to use, informative, attractive, and, most importantly, place high in the 
search engines. It doesn’t have to be fancy, complicated, or expensive. It’s 
easy to fall for flash over functionality, but I encourage you to have an attrac-
tive, clean-looking Web site that represents the personality of your inn. Most 
travelers research lodging choices on the Web, so your Web site may create 
a guest’s first impression.
Brushing up on Internet lingo
Internet jargon can be confusing, so here are a few key terms to help you 
become familiar with Web site lingo:
 
✓ Web site address: People often use the terms domain name and URL to 
refer to Web site addresses.
 
• Domain Name: This is the part of your Web site address after the 
www. For example, in www.journeyinn.com, journeyinn.com is 
the domain name.
 
• URL: This stands for Universal Resource Locator, and it refers to 
the full Web site address of a particular page. For example, www.
journeyinn.com is the URL for Journey Inn’s home page, www.
journeyinn.com/rooms-suites.php is the URL for their 
rooms page, and www.journeyinn.com/breakfast.php is the 
URL for their breakfast page.
 
✓ Domain Registrar: You register your domain name with a domain reg-
istrar. Just as two people can’t have the same phone number, domain 
registrars keep track of domain ownership to prevent two people or 
companies from registering the same domain name. You can register 
your domain name with established domain registrars like Network 
Solutions (www.networksolutions.com), GoDaddy (www.godaddy.
com) or Dotster (www.dotster.com). The fees to register a domain 
name vary by company, but should not exceed $35 per year. Domain reg-
istrations are for a period of one to ten years. Registering your domain 
for a longer term means you don’t need to worry about renewing it every 
year, and some think that Google gives a slight preference to domains 
that are registered for longer periods.

146
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
 Most registrars offer the option of having your domain name automati-
cally renewed, which is a good idea. Always mark the renewal dates of 
your domains on your calendar so you can verify that the renewal has 
been completed, even if you sign up for automatic renewals.
 
 Many unethical domain registrars send innkeepers false e-mail renewal 
notices, and many busy innkeepers pay them thinking they are renewing 
their domain. It’s important to make sure you know who you are regis-
tered with and when your renewal is due.
 
✓ Hosting company: A hosting company is a company you pay to make 
your Web site available to online users 24 hours a day via a server, or 
large computer. Just as dialing a phone number connects a caller to a 
particular location, entering a URL in a browser connects an online user 
to your Web site via your hosting company’s server. Your hosting com-
pany can also help you set up your e-mail and get rid of spam, or unso-
licited junk e-mail. To pick a hosting company, ask other innkeepers or 
the person who helps you design your Web site for referrals.
 
✓ Keywords: These are simply the words that prospective guests are most 
likely to use when searching online for a bed & breakfast. Many guests 
looking for an oceanfront bed & breakfast in Cape May, New Jersey, type 
the keywords “oceanfront,” “bed,” “breakfast,” “cape may,” and/or “new 
jersey” into Google or another search engine to begin their search. Good 
Web sites include keywords in their text not only because that’s what 
guests are looking for, but also because keywords are one of the ways 
search engines match guest requests with the results that they display.
Optimizing your site’s chances of being found
Professional strategies known as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) should 
be implemented on your Web site to ensure that prospective guests who are 
using search engines to look for lodging will find your inn. Before you begin 
to design your site — or even choose a domain name — you should either 
find out about SEO or consult a professional. (See the “Hiring a Web site 
designer” section later in this chapter). Making wise design and domain name 
choices can boost your placement by the search engines.
 
Many companies offer SEO services, some good and some bad. Stay on the 
safe side — stick with those who are familiar with the bed & breakfast indus-
try, and be sure to check their references.
If you’re opening a new inn, you should begin designing your Web site and 
register your domain name as soon as possible. You should have your Web 
site or a “coming soon” page, with a brief introduction about your inn, online 
three to six months before opening. This gets you in front of the search 
engines sooner and lets guests planning ahead know you’ll be opening and 
when. Start by picking a domain name that’s easy for guests to remember, 
closely matches your inn name, and contains keywords guests are likely to 
use when searching for an inn like yours. (See Chapter 5 for information on 

147
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
picking a name for your inn.) Registering common misspellings for your inn 
name is also a good idea. For example, if your inn name includes “Harbor,” 
consider registering the same domain with the spelling “Harbour.”
 
Choose one primary domain name and have any others set as secondary 
names, which point to the primary domain name. Otherwise, the search 
engines may think you’re trying to cheat with multiple listings, and your Web 
site may be penalized.
If you’re buying an existing inn, you may be thinking about changing the inn’s 
name or Web site address. You shouldn’t feel compelled to live with an inn 
name or domain name you’re not happy with, but you should be aware of the 
ramifications of making a change. The longer a Web site is online, the higher — 
and more frequently — search engines are likely to display it when users type 
in relevant keywords, and the more likely guests are to visit your site. Changing 
domain names puts you back at square one in terms of establishing your site in 
the search engines.
 
For more information about getting your Web site displayed in search results, 
check out Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Peter Kent 
(Wiley).
Knowing what makes a good Web site
Think of your Web site as an extension of your inn’s personality. It’s like a 
calling card with your inn’s marketing message. It’s also the first thing many 
guests see about your inn. You don’t get a second chance to make a first 
impression, so make sure your Web site greets your potential guests in a 
style that reflects what you have to offer.
Professional photography
Pictures say a thousand words when promoting your bed & breakfast, and 
the quality of your photos has an enormous effect on how people view your 
inn. A good-quality digital camera is a versatile tool that every innkeeper 
should have. In addition to taking photos of your inn when initially setting 
up your Web site, it can come in handy in dozens of other ways. Having a 
camera on hand to snap photos of memorable guests, wonderful dishes 
you’ve cooked, or other noteworthy events enables you to continually update 
your Web site and blog with new material.
You can’t compete in today’s “eye candy” society with amateurish photos. 
The most stunning inn can look like a fleabag motel on the Web if the photos 
of it aren’t done well. If your own photography skills aren’t up to snuff, you 
may want to hire a professional photographer. Professional photos are 
expensive, but easily worth their cost in reservations.
If you have your Web site professionally designed, the designer may recom-
mend specific professional photographers. Some companies, like Jumping 
Rocks Photography (www.jumpingrocks.com), Acorn Internet Services 

148
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
(www.acorn-is.com) and George Gardner Associates (www.marketing
forinns.com) specialize in photographing bed & breakfasts. They can help 
you spread your message by creating images that appeal specifically to the 
clientele you are trying to attract.
If your inn is known for its mountain views and you offer guests the oppor-
tunity to have breakfast on a deck overlooking the mountains, experienced 
photographers can capture the essence of this guest experience in their 
photos. To get inspiration for how a setting can sell your property, take a 
look at the opening shots and views captured on Inn at Riverbend’s Web site 
(www.innatriverbend.com).
 
If you don’t have photographs on your Web site, guests will wonder what 
you’re hiding. Even if it’s just a few good shots, start your Web site with 
pictures.
Take numerous shots until you achieve the look that you want to portray to 
guests. Experiment with different angles. Try pushing the furniture a little 
closer together to improve your photos. You can also rent lighting equip-
ment, which can improve photos a great deal. It’s important to get your Web 
site online as soon as possible, so don’t wait until you’ve finished renovating 
or building to take pictures.
You can take pictures of your inn’s views right away to get a jump-start on 
your Web site. And after you’ve purchased a few pieces of furniture, you 
can stage even more photos. I know of some innkeepers who staged a photo 
shoot in their apartment with an antique bed that would be in one of the 
guest rooms. They made the bed, placed a tray of delectable goodies on it 
and flowers alongside it, and shot some close-ups. The beautiful, antique, 
four-poster bed was intended to be the focus of the guest room, so it made 
sense to feature it in pictures. This allowed them to start their Web site with 
pictures even before construction of the B&B was complete.
 
It’s so important to start your Web site early in the planning process of your 
B&B that some inns have successfully used stock photos for outdoor and 
food shots.
Compelling text
The text on your Web site should be descriptive, compelling, and easy to 
read. The goal is to immediately convey your marketing message, your inn’s 
best features and location, and what your inn is known for. Your Web site will 
be useful to guests and generate many reservations if you make this informa-
tion prominent on the home page of your Web site.
Be sure to include the keywords that you think guests will search for when 
looking for accommodations such as yours. Whispering Pines in Dellroy, 
Ohio, does a nice job of this in their Web site’s opening paragraph:

149
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
Welcome to the gently rolling hills of the Atwood Lake Region. Whispering 
Pines, an Ohio bed and breakfast, sits on a hill overlooking the picturesque 
and lush landscape of Atwood Lake where the views are breathtaking and 
the surroundings are indescribably tranquil. Atwood Lake’s 28 miles of 
scenic shoreline is the perfect setting for picnics, hiking, and water activities.
This creates an image of an idyllic setting in the viewer’s mind. It also 
includes many keywords, such as “Ohio,” “bed and breakfast,” “Atwood 
Lake,” and “hiking.” Text is a huge contributor to search engine placement, 
and the appropriate use of keywords in the first paragraph is the most impor-
tant placement factor.
Easy navigation
Think about the frustration you experience when you find a Web site but 
you’re not able to find the information you need. This is exactly what you 
want to avoid. Make it simple for guests to find your contact information, 
room pictures, rates, availability, information about the local area, and 
details about your inn, including what type of breakfast you serve, the ameni-
ties you offer, and your policies. Most importantly, make it obvious and easy 
for guests to see how to make a reservation.
Your home page is the main page on your site, and it’s of utmost importance 
because it’s usually the first page guests see. Ask yourself the following ques-
tions about your home page:
 
✓ Is it appealing?
 
✓ Does it capture prospective guests’ attention?
 
✓ Does it convey the image I want to about my inn?
 
✓ Is it easy for guests to find critical contact information? (Without this, 
they can’t make a reservation.)
Guests should be able to do everything quickly and easily from your home 
page — and every page — on your site. To accomplish this, you need tabs or 
links that are easy to find on each page of your Web site. These links serve 
as connections to the various sections (or pages) of your site, such as Home, 
Rooms, Area Attractions, Specials, Make a Reservation, Contact Us, and so 
forth. These links should be above the fold (meaning they’re visible without a 
guest having to scroll down) and in the same place on every page, so guests 
don’t have to spend time figuring out how to go from one page to another.
 
One-page Web sites are as outdated as the Model T. Multiple pages not only 
make it easier to organize and categorize information, but they also increase 
your chances of high placement with search engines. Search engines count 
the number of pages on your Web site, and more is better — as long as they 
have good content.

150
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Fast loading
A quick-loading home page is essential. If a page takes more than a few sec-
onds to load, viewers are likely to give up on it, and you lose the possibility of 
that guest making a reservation at your inn. High-speed Internet is common 
in most places, but some people still access the Web via slower dial-up con-
nections, so be sure to keep this in mind if you design your own Web site.
If your Web site is slow to load, compress any digital pictures on the site to 
no more than 72 dpi. Photo editing software makes this easy to do. If your 
site still loads slowly, the problem may be with your Web hosting company. 
Talk to them, and stay on top of the issue until you’re satisfied with the 
speed at which your site loads.
Creating the site yourself
If you have a background in programming, you may want to try creating 
your Web site yourself. Web page editing software, such as Front Page or 
Dreamweaver, can guide you through the process. (For help using these pro-
grams, see Front Page 2003 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies by John 
Paul Mueller or Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies by Janine C. Warner [both 
published by Wiley].) Another alternative is to check with domain registrars 
and hosting companies, many of which have online templates and other 
resources available to help you build a simple Web site.
Designing and maintaining a Web site can require a tremendous amount of 
time and effort, which may take you away from the many other things that 
need to be done to get your inn ready for guests. Although experimenting 
with Web design may be fun, if this is a new area for you, you may be forego-
ing some great features and a professional look because you don’t have the 
necessary skills or aren’t aware of the newest Web technologies that could 
benefit your business.
 
You’re investing a lot of money and resources into your B&B. Your Web site is 
the most important tool you have to bring guests to your inn, so consider 
carefully before deciding to design the site yourself. Being able to update your 
rates and packages is a nice feature that many professional designers can set 
up for you.
Hiring a Web site designer
Hiring a Web site designer is no different than hiring a contractor to per-
form physical work at your inn. It requires a careful selection process and a 
clear vision of the finished product you want. Don’t try to cut corners here. 
Remember, you’re hiring someone to create your most valuable marketing 
tool and the public online presence of your B&B.
Here are some things to consider when hiring — and ultimately working 
with — a Web site designer:

151
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
 
✓ Look for a designer who’s open to your input. You may not be a Web 
design expert, but only you can describe the personal vision you have 
for your inn. The designer you hire should ask a lot of questions about 
the marketing messages you’re trying to convey.
 
 You should have a strong vision of what you want your Web site to look 
like. You probably have a file of pictures torn from magazines of deco-
rating ideas that you like. Create a similar file of Web sites with features 
you like, and share them with designers. No one can read your mind.
 
✓ Look for a Web site designer who knows the bed & breakfast industry. 
The following designers have specialized in the B&B industry for years, 
are familiar with SEO, and have created hundreds of successful bed & 
breakfast Web sites:
 
• Acorn Internet Services (www.acorn-is.com)
 
• InsideOut Solutions (www.savvyinnkeeper.com)
 
• Rare Brick (www.rarebrick.com)
 
• Whitestone Marketing (www.whitestonemarketing.com)
 
✓ Find out who designed other B&B Web sites you like. Pretend you’re 
a guest looking for a bed & breakfast, and search for inns as a guest 
would. Visit the Web sites that come up first in the search engines. If you 
like the design of a particular site, look at the bottom of the home page 
to see who designed it. (This is usually listed under Hosting/Design or 
Marketing/Promotion.)
 
 It’s a good idea to look in nearby towns and not just your own. Using a 
designer who has already worked successfully with one or more inns in 
your town has both pros and cons. On the one hand, your site may not 
be as original as you’d like; on the other hand, the designer has a proven 
track record.
 
 Repeat your search in other geographic areas to find inns that are 
branded the way you’d like yours to be. For example, you might search 
using the keywords “mountain getaway, Colorado” and “mountain get-
away, Montana.”
 
✓ Request and check references. Talk to other innkeepers who have used 
the designer that you’re considering. Ask around at conferences and in 
innkeeper forums for advice. (See Chapter 1 for resources you can draw 
upon). Ask for examples of the designers’ work.
 
✓ Ask about getting mockups of your site. After you find a designer you 
like and sign on with them, you’ll want to get mockups of their ideas for 
your site. A mockup is a picture of what some of the pages on your site 
might look like. It’s a non-functional but graphically pleasing way to get 
a feel for the type of work this designer is capable of. Creating mockups 
gives both you and the designer something to look at when talking about 
your future Web site to be sure you both have the same vision and mes-
sage in mind. Make sure the mockups match the look and feel of your 

152
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
marketing image in terms of style, color, layout, and features. Examining 
mockups together makes it easier to enact the changes you want by 
having a concrete example to modify and improve.
 
✓ Find out whether you’ll be able to edit pages yourself. Many designers 
can create pages on your Web site that you can edit and update your-
self. This gives you the flexibility to change your rates and add packages 
and specials as often as you like. Being able to adjust rates by season 
and demand gives you more flexibility to manage the inventory of your 
business (your rooms). Having the ability to add specials anytime allows 
you to take advantage of special events, holidays, or activities in your 
area. Without the ability to make frequent updates, you may miss out on 
opportunities to get bookings.
 
✓ Ask whether the designer is willing to accept payment in phases. You 
should never pay a designer everything up front. Paying a Web designer 
in phases, just as you would a contractor, is customary.
 
If your Web designer registers your domain name, be sure you are listed as 
the registrant (owner). You domain name is a valuable asset, just like the 
physical building of your B&B. You don’t want there to be any doubt as to who 
owns your domain, in case you decide not to work with a particular designer 
or Web host in the future.
Getting guests to your Web site
Having a fabulous Web site that no one knows about is like having an unlisted 
phone number and not giving it out to anyone. Links from other quality Web 
sites to yours are essential. As an added benefit, sites that are linked to other 
quality sites are ranked higher by search engines. Once you get guests to 
your Web site, they’ll be focused on your inn only. Here are some tips for 
making that happen:
 
✓ Anytime your inn is mentioned in an article, either online or in print, ask 
the author to include a link to your Web site, and offer to give them a 
link in return.
 
 Try to get them to link to the page on your site that’s most relevant to 
the article. For example, if the article is about weddings that you host, 
ask them to link to your wedding page rather than your home page. This 
is better for both you and their readers.
 
✓ Submit your site to the major search engines — Google, Yahoo!, and 
MSN — by using the following links:
 
• Google: www.google.com/addurl/
 
• Yahoo!: https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit
 
• MSN/Live Search: http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.

 While it doesn’t hurt to submit your site to the search engines, it’s not 
strictly necessary. As long as other sites are linking to your site, search 
engines will find you. But if you’re eager to get started and don’t have 
anyone linking to you yet, submitting your site to the major search 
engines will get things rolling. Make sure you read each search engine’s 
Webmaster rules and don’t hire anyone to do “automatic” submissions 
of your Web site to hundreds of search engines at once.
 
✓ When evaluating advertising opportunities, verify that the ad will 
include a link to your Web site.
 
✓ Include your Web site address on all business cards, stationery, and 
rack cards or brochures.
 
✓ Always have a supply of business cards, brochures, or rack cards with 
you to give to anyone you meet who expresses interest in your inn.
Listing in online directories
You’ve probably used online directories to find some of the bed & breakfasts 
you’ve visited, but you may not have known you were on a B&B directory. An 
online directory is a Web site that lists numerous bed & breakfasts by posting 
their advertisements, which are usually paid for by the innkeepers. A direc-
tory may list anywhere from a dozen to a several thousand bed & breakfasts. 
At last count, over 150 online directories existed with new ones starting up 
all the time. Their names are often similar and their promises may sound 
the same, but their results can be very different. More inns spend money on 
online B&B directories than any other form of advertising. Most innkeepers 
are listed in several directories, and many attribute a significant percentage 
of their reservations to a few online B&B directories.
Understanding what a directory is
A directory is a combination of an online guidebook and a search engine. 
Directories have surpassed guidebooks in popularity by providing potential 
guests with an easy way to find and compare hundreds of B&Bs in one place. 
Unlike guidebooks, good online directories are constantly being updated with 
new rates, pictures, and bed & breakfasts for guests to choose from.
When your inn is listed in a directory, the listing is an advertisement for your 
inn. Because most directory listings are comprehensive in the coverage of 
the inns they list, guests usually don’t realize the listings are paid advertise-
ments. Directories come in all shapes and sizes, so investigate sites that 
mesh with your geographic area and the types of guests you want to attract 
to your B&B. There are worldwide directories, local and regional directories, 
and directories that cater to special interests (such as gay & lesbian travel, 
traveling with pets, Christian travel, and so on).

154
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Online bed & breakfast directories offer guests a variety of useful features to 
search for an inn, and they offer you an easy way to quickly gain an Internet 
presence with very little effort or expense. Most directories have simple 
online registration forms, whereby you can upload information and pictures 
through a template to create a listing. Some directory listings contain as 
much information as most inns’ Web sites, and guests frequently cannot dif-
ferentiate between the two. Many directories have staff available to help you 
create your listing if you’re not comfortable using a computer.
Choosing the right directories
Sorting through the huge number of directory prospects that are available 
is a difficult task for anyone, especially a busy innkeeper. Many directories 
are extremely aggressive in contacting inns with special offers and promo-
tions. If you haven’t already, you’ll soon be receiving numerous unsolicited 
e-mails, which you should evaluate carefully before pulling out your credit 
card. Although the cost to join the top directories is reasonable and an excel-
lent use of your marketing budget, be cautious when making your choices. 
Bargains are tempting, but remember that putting together a quality product 
costs money. Many free or low-cost directories are not actively managed 
because they don’t have the budget for a full-time staff. When you’re unsure, 
pick up the phone. If you can’t reach the directory’s staff when you want to 
join, it’s a pretty sure bet that this directory will be difficult to keep up-to-date.
 
You want to be sure that anything you publish on the Internet stays current 
and brings results, and updating dozens of free directories each time you 
change rates or add amenities requires a tremendous time commitment. Fast-
forward three years: You don’t want a potential guest calling and arguing for 
an old rate. That guest won’t care that the site was free and you couldn’t spare 
the time to update it, and if you don’t grant the guest’s request, you’ll create 
the impression that your business doesn’t honor its posted prices.
On the other side of the coin, if a lower-cost directory is working better than 
a higher priced one, you can certainly save some money by dropping the 
higher-priced directory. (See Chapter 15 for help in determining which adver-
tising is working.)
There are no absolute guarantees when picking a directory, but here are 
some tips to help you sort through the vast array of choices:
 
✓ Perform several Internet searches as a guest would to see which direc-
tories are listed first. You should be listed in any directory that comes 
up on the first results page of the most popular guest searches. Think 
of the keywords that guests might enter to find inns in your area or 
inns that offer what you do. There are many search engines that guests 
may use, but Google is the most popular. Start by doing the following 
searches on Google, and later you can drill down further and repeat the 
same searches on Yahoo!, AOL, MSN, and so on. You probably won’t find 

155
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
any directory that comes up on every search, but keep track of the ones 
you see most often — these are the ones you should consider first. Here 
are some common searches you should perform:
 
• Bed and Breakfast
 
• Your State Bed and Breakfast (for example, New York Bed and 
Breakfast)
 
• Your City, State Bed and Breakfast (for example, Hyde Park, New 
York Bed and Breakfast)
 
• Abbreviations for your state bed and breakfast (for example, NY 
bed and breakfast)
 
• Popular tourist locations, Your state Bed and Breakfast (for exam-
ple, Wine Country, California Bed and Breakfast)
 
 Repeat the above searches using “B&B” and “bed & breakfast” in place 
of “bed and breakfast.”
 
 Do not use this method as the only way to choose a directory. If a partic-
ular directory doesn’t currently have any listings in your city, it won’t 
come up in your searches. If you later decide this is a good directory to 
advertise in, you’ll have the advantage of being the only one listed in 
your locale.
 
✓ Ask advice from other innkeepers. Ask other innkeepers which directo-
ries are effective for them by asking questions in innkeeper forums and 
association meetings and by speaking with other B&B owners you’ve 
met (see Chapter 1 for help locating innkeeper resources).
 
✓ Keep in mind that geography plays a large role in the effectiveness 
of directories. A directory that has better results on the West Coast 
is great if your bed & breakfast is in Oregon, but not so hot if you’re in 
Vermont.
 
✓ Remember which directories you see mentioned in magazines, news-
papers, and on TV. Often prospective guests tear out magazine and 
newspaper articles to save for future reference. Pay attention to which 
directories are quoted as resources by the media. Directories that fre-
quently appear in the media usually have aggressive PR efforts that can 
help your inn gain good press.
 
✓ Look for niche directories. If you have a special niche, like being pet-
friendly or Christian-oriented, refine your Google search to seek out 
directories that promote these niches (for examples, check out www.
petswelcome.com and www.icbbn.com).
 
✓ Determine whether the directory is well organized. Guests should be 
able to easily find your bed & breakfast on the directory, so pretend 
you’re using the directory as a guest, and see how many clicks it takes 
to find your B&B on the site. Also check to see whether a lot of outside 
advertisements have the potential to lure prospective guests away from 
the site (and your inn).

156
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Look for directories that represent the personality of your inn. Ask your-
self whether your B&B is a good fit. If your bed & breakfast is a Victorian 
inn with four guest rooms, a directory of small hotels and large inns prob-
ably isn’t going to attract the type of B&B guests you’re looking for.
To get you started, Table 8-1 lists some of the most popular online directo-
ries in alphabetical order.

Ask about special offers for members of any B&B associations that you belong 
to. Also, some directories have special offers for new innkeepers, so be sure to 
tell them you’re new to the business.
No matter which directories you start out with, you’ll want to track their per-
formance before renewing with them. (See Chapter 15 for help in analyzing 
your advertising results.)
 
Many new directories pick a name similar to established directories and then 
send innkeepers e-mail renewal notices. Many busy innkeepers pay them, 
thinking they’re renewing one of their existing directory listings. Don’t fall into 
that trap.

157
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
Featuring your B&B on state, local, 
and association Web sites
Taking advantage of the extensive advertising campaigns of your local, 
regional, and state tourism boards is an excellent opportunity to get the 
word out about your inn. The job of these organizations is to “sell” travelers 
on your area and provide tourists with comprehensive information. Tourism 
organizations provide information on many topics, including local activities, 
restaurants, festivals, and places to stay.
Not all sites are created equal in terms of their adverting value to you. Some 
states and chambers of commerce or visitors bureaus are more devoted to 
promoting travel and tourism than others. To determine which groups to 
join, look for signs that the organization is actively promoting travel and tour-
ism in your area. The best way to find this out is to look for prominent links 
to lodging options right on the organization’s home page.
State tourism Web sites
If you’re in a state that devotes a lot of resources to promoting tourism — and 
most do — check out the official state tourism Web site and see whether lodg-
ing is listed and easy to find. If so, find out how you can get your B&B listed, 
especially if the site includes a category for bed & breakfasts. Some states, 
such as Arkansas, partner with the state bed & breakfast association so when 
visitors call looking for lodging information, they’re offered a free book that 
lists bed & breakfasts in the state. This is a very targeted way to let potential 
guests know about your inn. Links between state promotions and local bed 
& breakfast associations make the association membership that much more 
valuable. Guests tend to remember finding you in the book the state sent 
them, so the effectiveness of this type of advertising is easy to track.
Chamber of commerce Web sites
One benefit of being a member of your local chamber of commerce is 
being listed on their Web site. The value of this from a marketing perspec-
tive depends on how actively the chamber promotes their Web site, how 
organized the site is, and how many people use it to find lodging. Some 
chambers provide innkeepers with many reservation referrals, while others 
provide little or no help in advertising because other organizations, such as 
convention and visitors bureaus, provide the marketing function for lodg-
ing. Research your local chamber of commerce, tourism board, and visitors 
bureau to find out which organizations handle lodging referrals.
Surprisingly, some large chambers that offer lodging resources in well-known 
tourist destinations are not a big source of reservations for their member 
inns, while some inns in lesser-known areas with smaller chambers report 

158
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
great success from their memberships. Evaluating all the benefits the mem-
bership offers and asking other innkeepers what works for them can help 
you make informed decisions about which organizations to join. Carefully 
tracking where guests tell you they found your inn can help you determine 
whether the membership is worth maintaining after the first year.
 
You can belong to more than one chamber of commerce. For example, if you 
have a bed & breakfast in Lenox, Massachusetts, you may be able to join the 
Berkshires Visitors Bureau, the Lenox Chamber of Commerce, and nearby 
town chambers, such as the Stockbridge Chamber of Commerce.
Local Web sites
Taking the time to seek out local Web sites can pay big rewards when it 
comes to promoting your inn. Local businesses may be willing to exchange 
links from their Web site to yours. This means they’re referring their custom-
ers to you — for free. For example, a local winery might have a section about 
lodging on their Web site. If so, contact them to request that your inn be 
listed; if such a section doesn’t exist, suggest that they create one. In return, 
you could have a section on your Web site for area activities, and include a 
link to the winery. Doing this with several Web sites provides your guests 
with resources about area activities, and gets other sites to link to yours 
in the process. Not only does this strategy have the potential to bring new 
guests to your inn, but it usually improves your ranking by search engines, 
which consider linked sites a plus.
 
Beware of having too much of a good thing. Links that don’t make sense may 
actually hurt you. Search engines use algorithms that make them suspicious of 
too many inbound and outbound links (links coming into your Web site or 
links to other Web sites from yours). People used to abuse this technique, and 
the search engines caught on. Stick with partnerships and link exchanges that 
provide information and resources for your guests, and don’t add too many 
links at once.
B&B association Web sites
Belonging to local and state B&B associations can provide you with a wealth 
of information and resources, and many associations are organized to pro-
vide specific marketing assistance to their members. Strong B&B associations 
can also drive a significant amount of guest traffic to your Web site. When 
you contact the associations, ask about the benefits of membership and the 
marketing efforts of the association.
Organized advertising campaigns are often coordinated by local, regional, and 
state bed & breakfast associations. Inn tours, frequent stay programs and gift 
certificates may further enhance the advertising reach of these associations.
 
If the association’s Web site places high in a Google search, be sure your inn is 
listed on their site, with a link back to your site.

159
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
Generating Word-of-Mouth Promotion
Word-of-mouth promotion is great for two reasons: It doesn’t cost anything, 
and potential guests view it as more genuine than viewing an advertisement. 
Don’t be shy about trying to generate recommendations and word-of-mouth 
promotion for your inn. This is a time to toot your own horn and get others 
to toot it for you as well.
Getting guest referrals
Guest referrals are like found treasure and should be rewarded. There is no 
greater compliment a guest can give you than to vouch for your inn and rec-
ommend it to a friend, colleague, or family member.
Be sure to treat referrals as a gift and thank the referrer. A short personal 
note or e-mail is a perfect way to say thanks for the referral. Some innkeep-
ers also send the referrer a small discount certificate to be used on their next 
visit within a given period of time (approximately 10 percent is appreciated 
and appropriate).
Think of clever and unobtrusive ways to ask for referrals. If you’re having 
trouble thinking of ideas, here are a few to get you started:
 
✓ Mail or e-mail a thank you. After each stay, send guests a thank-you 
telling them that you hope they enjoyed their stay. This is a good time 
to tell them you value their feedback and ask them to post a review. The 
addition of a simple statement like, “The greatest compliment is your 
guest referrals” is a low-key way to remind guests that you appreciate 
their referrals.
 
✓ Ask for referrals. When guests compliment you about their stay, tell 
them you hope they will tell their friends and family so that you may 
have the privilege of hosting them in the future. If you publish a news-
letter (see Chapter 15), include a section about appreciating the many 
referrals you’ve received from previous guests and add that you look 
forward to welcoming them to your inn.
Seeing everyone as a potential guest
Whether you think of yourself as a salesperson or not, you are. Everyone, 
everywhere is a potential guest. You have the nonstop job of selling your inn 
to everyone you come in contact with. Here are some ways to constantly be 
ready to promote your inn:

160
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Always carry a supply of business or rack cards/brochures with you.
 
✓ Have shirts made with your inn’s name and logo, and wear them.
 
✓ Include an e-mail signature with your inn information on all your 
e-mails — business-related and otherwise.
 
✓ Offer to host meetings at your inn for clubs or organizations you belong 
to. By impressing members with your wonderful hospitality, you encour-
age them to recommend your B&B to visiting family and friends.
Handling online guest reviews
The jury is out amongst innkeepers about whether to embrace or reject online 
reviews, but like it or not, they’re here to stay and their popularity is growing. 
While you might not be comfortable asking guests to post reviews, finding out 
what they are and how to use them to your benefit is another marketing strat-
egy. Guest reviews are comments (both positive and negative) from previous 
guests about your inn. They’re considered word-of-mouth advertising because 
they tell future guests what they liked and disliked about your inn. Managing 
your online review image is a part of managing your brand and your inn’s 
identity.
Harnessing the power of positive reviews
Guests are more likely to believe something another guest says about your 
inn than an advertisement you write, so managing the impression guests 
get about your inn from reviews is important. Guests know the difference 
between a Holiday Inn and a Four Seasons. In the case of your B&B, however, 
they have only your word and the Web — your site and those of online direc-
tories — to try and figure out the difference between you and the B&B across 
town. Having many reviews from guests who have enjoyed their stays at your 
B&B is a great testimonial about your inn, and often the reason a future guest 
chooses your inn over the competition.
Positive reviews are free advertising, so here are some tips on how to encour-
age satisfied guests to share their reviews with others:
 
✓ Ask guests to write a review. When guests compliment you about some 
aspect of their stay, encourage them to share their views online. Guests 
often feel they want to do something for you after you’ve helped them 
have an enjoyable getaway, so asking them to share a review with future 
guests is perfectly fine.
 
✓ Include a link to sites that maintain reviews for your inn in thank you 
e-mails and notes to your guests. This makes posting reviews easier for 
your guests, and allows you to direct their reviews to the sites you prefer.

161
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
 
✓ Rotate the sites you ask guests to post reviews on monthly. You can’t 
expect each guest to post reviews on multiple sites, but you don’t want 
all the reviews to end up on one site at the expense of another.
 
✓ To help guests remember to post reviews, some inns distribute guest 
comment cards. Some directories have premade cards or you can pre-
pare your own. You can leave them on an information table or in the 
guest’s room, or include them in thank-you notes. The cards may serve 
as reminders for the guests to post a review on a given site, or they may 
be cards that the guests fill out and mail to the site directly.
 
✓ Offer to let guests use a computer to post reviews. Some inns have a 
guest computer in the common area with links to sites that maintain 
reviews listed under favorites. Be aware, however, that asking guests 
to post reviews on the spot may make them uncomfortable, and some 
review sites can filter reviews coming from the same IP address.
Managing bad reviews
Negative reviews give you a chance to show potential guests the true extent 
of your hospitality. All reputable review sites give you the opportunity to 
respond to a reviewer’s comments. Savvy innkeepers take this opportunity 
to “talk” to future guests by letting their concern for their guests’ experiences 
shine through.
Following are two examples in which innkeepers used negative comments to 
show their hospitality and their desire to make each guest’s stay wonderful:
 
✓ One guest gave an inn a negative review because the breakfast was not as 
advertised. The innkeeper politely responded by explaining that “at the 
last minute, this guest told us she was checking out at 7 a.m. for a business 
meeting, although the posted time for breakfast was 8:30 a.m. I didn’t have 
time to create the planned dish, which takes an hour in the oven, so I quickly 
whipped up an omelet using the same ingredients as those in the casserole.”
 
✓ An innkeeper responded to a guest who complained about the guest 
rooms this way: “It is our wonderful guests who help to make us better 
hosts by letting us know of issues that many times we are just not aware of. 
For those who have allergies, special needs, or prefer more open space, 
please let us know when making your reservation. We can remove many 
items from your room if needed. Thank you for your input; we wish you 
had told us during your visit so we could have accommodated you better.”
Keep in mind that most reasonable people understand that you can’t fully 
please every single guest all the time. Bad news can even be good news, 
because when potential guests see a full list of glowing, positive reviews, they 
tend to wonder whether they’re authentic or written solely by the innkeepers 
and their friends. Having a few less-glowing reviews mixed in with many posi-
tive ones makes your good reviews seem more legitimate.

162
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Networking for fun and profit
You’ve chosen the profession of innkeeping, so use your love of people and 
your social skills to promote your bed & breakfast. Networking takes a vari-
ety of forms. In its simplest terms, it’s meeting people, getting to know them, 
and finding out what they can do to help your business and what you can do 
to help theirs.
Meeting your new neighbors
Getting to know your neighbors early in the planning process of your B&B 
can prove to be part of your business’s success. Generating goodwill among 
your neighbors can have many tangible and intangible benefits. Whether 
you’re taking over an existing inn or opening a new one, having the neighbor-
hood on your team is always a positive thing. Neighbors can be a source of 
referrals. They can also support — or oppose — your expansion plans or any 
zoning-related issues, including parking, what type of sign you have out front, 
and how many guests you can accommodate. Here are some suggestions for 
being neighborly:
 
✓ Invite neighbors in for a tour of your inn.
 
✓ If you host bridal showers and other get-togethers, make sure your neigh-
bors know your inn is available as a venue for their special gatherings.
 
✓ Consider offering a local discount to your neighbors’ visiting family and 
friends if they stay with you.
Getting to know city hall
Getting to know your local officials can never start too early in the planning 
process of your bed & breakfast. Like your neighbors, local officials can be a 
great source of referrals and can help or hinder zoning decisions regarding 
your B&B. Many successful innkeepers are actively involved in their com-
munities, which helps their businesses and gives them input and first-hand 
information about local happenings.
Get to know city hall by:
 
✓ Visiting and passing out your rack cards or brochures. Accompanying 
them with a sampling of your baked goods makes your inn more 
memorable.
 
✓ Attending chamber meetings. Take a supply of brochures and rack 
cards with you.
 
✓ Offering to host meetings at your inn. This gives you the opportunity to 
showcase your hospitality.

163
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
Connecting with other local businesses
You’re probably not the only small business in your town, and many other 
local businesses face the same challenges and issues you do. From hiring 
employees to zoning issues, you have a lot in common. Seek out other small 
businesses to exchange information and resources with.
 
Get to know other local businesses by:
 
✓ Creating a mailing that introduces your inn to other local businesses.
 
✓ Visiting local businesses with rack cards and brochures to introduce 
yourself and your B&B. Bringing muffins or cookies will ensure that they 
remember you.
 
✓ Visiting gas stations with rack cards, brochures, preprinted directions 
to your inn, and baked goods is a great way to spread the word about 
your inn because many visitors inquire about local lodging when they 
stop for gas. You need to make these visits frequently because gas sta-
tions have a high turnover of personnel.
 
✓ Hosting an open house (see Chapter 5) and inviting neighbors, local 
officials, and other local businesses. Not only is this a great way to net-
work, but it also allows others to see your B&B and hospitality in action, 
so they’re comfortable referring guests to you.
Partnering with local businesses can be mutually beneficial. For example, 
you could create a golf package with a local golf course, secure the freshest 
produce for your inn by getting to know and ordering from a local grower, 
or reach out to businesses that have colleagues or customers in need of 
accommodations.
Reconnecting with old friends
Connecting with old friends can be fun, and it’s also a way to build your 
business. A new innkeeper I know recently attended her college reunion and 
reconnected with a friend who writes the college newsletter. Through this 
connection, her bed & breakfast was prominently featured in the newsletter, 
resulting in many guest bookings.
 
New innkeepers often wonder about charging friends for staying at their inns. 
While this is a personal decision, remember your inn is your business. If 
you’re going to give friends rooms that could be taken by paying guests — not 
to mention working for and serving them — you should charge them. It is also 
a good idea to convey the importance of letting you know in advance if they 
can’t come so you can make the rooms available for other paying guests. 
Having the luxury to close the inn to other guests and invite old friends to 
your inn for a reunion where everyone chips in on the work is another story.

164
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Print Advertising
Seeing your name in print is always good, but the question to ask yourself is, 
“What’s it worth?” No discussion on marketing is complete without a discus-
sion of paid print advertisements. As guests move toward the Internet for 
instant information and newspaper and magazine circulation plummets, print 
advertising becomes less and less effective. Having your inn mentioned or 
featured in a print article, on the other hand, is priceless.
Newspapers and magazines: 
A thing of the past?
Surprisingly, newspaper and magazine advertising in any publication with a 
large distribution is usually a waste of money. Because inns themselves are 
not a destination, it’s unlikely that someone reading a well-known travel mag-
azine will call you as the result of a small ad placed in the classified section. 
These ads fail to produce results, and when you combine this with the high 
cost of even the smallest ads, it rarely makes sense to even experiment.
Local newspapers and publications may be a different story, and the cost 
is usually low enough to allow experimentation. Many innkeepers find that 
these publications are not successful in attracting locals; however, placing an 
ad in a local paper that tourists read may result in guest inquiries. If you’re 
going to experiment with local newspapers, try a paper from a nearby town. 
Guests who may not take a quick getaway in their own town may consider 
one 30 to 60 miles away.
 
If you do experiment with print advertising, have your Webmaster set up a 
separate URL so you can track the results.
If you’re fortunate enough to have your bed & breakfast featured in a pub-
lished article, you can expect your phone to ring. A mention in an article or a 
write-up about a special event at your inn will get better results than a paid 
advertisement. Therefore, when you’re holding an open house, be sure to put 
local editors and journalists on your guest list. (See Chapter 15 for more sug-
gestions on how to get your B&B featured by travel writers and the media.)
Getting into guidebooks
Don’t write off the guidebooks yet! While online Internet directories have 
replaced guidebooks in popularity, savvy innkeepers still seek out listings 
in the top guidebooks. Sometimes you’re lucky enough to get a call from 

165
 Chapter 8: B&B Marketing 101 
an editor creating or updating a guidebook who wants to include your 
B&B. Because such editors often contact the local chamber of commerce 
or convention and visitors bureau for recommendations, your networking 
and friendships there could get you a referral for inclusion. However, don’t 
sit back and wait for the top guidebooks to find you. Here are some tips for 
submitting your info to them:
 
✓ Frommer’s: Frommer’s accepts submissions by e-mail from their Web site 
at www.frommers.com (click on FAQ at the bottom of the home page).
 
✓ Fodor’s: Fodor’s accepts submissions by e-mail from their Web site at 
www.fodors.com (click on About Us at the bottom of the home page, 
and then select Contact Us from the menu on the left-hand side of the

✓ Mobil Travel Guide: Mobil Travel Guide covers many areas, and if 
your B&B is in an area they cover, you could receive a surprise knock 
at your door for an immediate inspection. If they don’t come to you 
and you’d like your inn to be considered, you can fill out an applica-
tion (which includes a fee). Information can be found on their Web site

Utilizing the Yellow Pages
Simply having a business phone line with AT&T entitles your B&B to a 
courtesy listing in the local print edition of their Yellow Pages. As with 
everything, take advantage of anything you’re entitled to. If your business 
line is with another carrier, you can pay to be listed. (Some inns try it for 
a year because results are easy to track; guests know if they found you in 
the phone book.) Yellowpages.com requires a separate fee for advertising. 
Contact information can be found for both print and online ads at www.

Evaluating rack cards and brochures
Is less more? Brochures look wonderful and contain lots of space for photos 
and information, but their cost can be prohibitive. Rack cards are less expen-
sive to produce, but have about 70 percent less space for photos and text. 
There are pros and cons to both methods of advertising, and, of course, 
some innkeepers choose to use both brochures and rack cards. When decid-
ing what’s best for your inn, ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Do you have enough professional images and well-written copy for a 
brochure? If not, rack cards are the better choice. Having a rack card 
with one or two perfect images is much smarter than having a brochure 
with 8 or 10 mediocre images.
 
✓ Is the view at your inn simply stunning, and a big part of your image? 
If so, creating a brochure that opens up to an oversize photo of your 
view is the way to go.
 
✓ How do your guests find you? Ask them, and keep track of their 
responses. Many inns report that they religiously place rack cards (or 
brochures) at the local visitors center, but doing so rarely results in 
bookings. However, rack cards left in the guest rooms or on their infor-
mation table are taken and given to friends.
Make sure that whatever you choose conveys the brand of your inn. Your 
rack card and/or brochure should match your Web site and other marketing 
materials in look, feel, tone, and color. Rack cards should be printed on qual-
ity card stock so they stand up well in display racks. And both rack cards and 
brochures should fit in a standard, #10 envelope for ease of mailing.

▶ Creating your own home space within your inn
I
f you’re like many innkeepers, you’ve fantasized about how you’re going 
to furnish your B&B and you’re thinking, “Now comes one of the fun 
parts!” Everyone enjoys certain aspects of their job more than others, so it’s 
okay if furnishing is one of your favorite parts of getting your inn ready for 
guests. It’s important to remember, though, that the furnishings you choose 
determine the comfort of your guests, the image of your inn, and even the 
price you can charge for your rooms. Practical, comfortable, sensible, appeal-
ing, inviting, and durable are all furnishing buzzwords in this chapter, and 
you should keep them in mind as you shop.
This chapter guides you in choosing a décor that defines your inn’s personal-
ity and shapes your guests’ experiences. You find out what to include when 
furnishing your inn and also the important considerations to make when fur-
nishing your own private accommodations. I tell you what practical and legal 
considerations to make regarding furnishings, and then you get to put all this 
information to work so your guests can’t help but say “Wow!” as they enter 
your inn.
 
Periodically stay at your inn as a guest. Pack a suitcase, and spread out every-
thing as a guest would. This is the best way to check for any amenities that 
you think you should add; find out if anything is missing, broken, or uncom-
fortable; determine whether you’re providing guests with adequate space; and 
assess the lighting and level of darkness in the guest rooms at night. When 
friends or family stay at the inn, take advantage of a fresh set of eyes and ask 
them to provide you with a critical review of their stay.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Decorating Your Inn: Choosing 
Practical but Tasteful Décor
It’s often said that the little things in life count and add up to something sen-
sational, and this concept applies to each choice you make in choosing the 
furnishings for your inn. The detail and thought you put into your choices 
add up to a sensational guest experience. As you go through the process of 
choosing the décor for your inn, keep the following things in mind:
 
✓ Guests choose your inn over a hotel, so they don’t want a sterile, 
cookie-cutter hotel guest room experience.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to get help if you need it. If you really don’t think you 
have what it takes to pick out the furnishings for your rooms, consider talk-
ing to a design consultant. Get recommendations and be clear about your 
decorating budget. It doesn’t cost anything to talk to a designer until you 
hire him. Designers usually can buy things at a lower price than you can, 
so hiring one may not cost you much more than doing the job yourself.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to ask for advice from other innkeepers whose styles 
you like. They’ll be flattered as long as you don’t copy anything exactly 
without their permission.
 
✓ Make sure your furnishings fit the look and feel of your B&B and its 
surroundings. Before choosing furnishings and accessories, evaluate 
your market, define your inn’s personality and theme, and set aside your 
personal taste. For example, a Southwestern look and feel isn’t a good 
match for a historic Victorian B&B, and a mountain ranch inn should 
have different furnishings than a gourmet inn in wine country.
 
✓ Use color to accent your rooms and complement the personality of 
your inn. For example, beautiful earth tones complement the splendid 
wilderness setting at The Prairie Creek Inn in Alberta, Canada (www.
theprairiecreekinn.com), and bold, vivid colors accentuate the 
Southwestern motif at the Chocolate Turtle in Corrales, New Mexico, 
(www.chocolateturtlebb.com).
 
✓ Initial perception and presentation prevail. If guests think your rooms 
are tastefully decorated and they have a good first impression of your 
inn, the rest of their experiences will usually start out positive. Studies 
have shown guests with positive first impressions are more satisfied 
customers and often overlook little things (such as an errant dust bunny 
or stray hair on the bathroom floor).
 
Walk through every inch of your inn just as a guest would, and make notes of 
what you want the guest to see and feel at each turn. Follow the guest’s typical 
route from entering the inn to seeing a room, to relaxing in the common areas, 

169
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
to strolling any outdoor space, and finally to enjoying the breakfast area. Does 
each furnished area convey the look, feel, and perception that you want guests 
to have about your inn, and do the areas come together as a whole?
Creating Comfortable Guest Rooms
Welcoming, comfortable, well-appointed guest rooms turn a happy guest into 
a repeat guest who refers others to your inn. The décor that achieves this 
mix is different at every inn and may even be different in each of the rooms at 
your own inn. For example, you may have a few pet-friendly rooms with less 
fancy appointments than the rooms booked by guests on a romantic getaway; 
similarly, rooms that accommodate children shouldn’t contain precious and 
breakable antiques.
 
Don’t put anything in your rooms that you can’t bear to part with if it gets 
broken or goes missing.
Key factors that influence the décor of your guest rooms in particular include
 
✓ The price of your guest rooms. Guests expect more expensive guest 
rooms to be larger with bigger beds and bathrooms and to have more 
luxurious amenities.
 
✓ The purpose of your guests’ visits. Tourists, vacationers, honeymoon-
ers, business travelers, and other categories of guests have different 
needs. For example, business travelers need a table or desk large 
enough for a laptop and space to spread out their papers.
This section helps you manage all decorative elements of your guest rooms, 
from general amenities and guidelines to beds, furnishings, and lighting.
Offering the most requested 
guest room amenities
Amenities are a big part of what separates the bed & breakfast experience 
from a typical hotel stay because you, the innkeeper and host, choose the 
amenities carefully and personally based on your guests needs and the expe-
rience you’re creating for them.
The amenities that you offer in guest rooms should fit the style and mood of 
your inn, support the price of your rooms, and create a desirable impression 
of your inn with guests. The more popular a feature or amenity, the more 

170
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
guests are willing to pay for it, and rooms with these amenities are often the 
first ones booked. While there are thousands of different extras offered by 
B&Bs, some popular and requested guest room amenities and features are
 
✓ Private bathroom
 
✓ Whirlpool tub or soaker tub (room for two is best)
 
✓ Fireplace
 
✓ Wireless Internet access
 
✓ Bottled water or water carafe
 
✓ Robes and slippers
 
✓ Ice bucket and glassware
 
✓ Luggage racks (two per room)
 
✓ Flowers
 
✓ Alarm clock (perhaps with a combined MP3 player and CD player)
 
✓ Magazines
 
✓ Stationery
 
✓ Docking station for MP3 players
 
✓ Iron and ironing board
 
✓ Turndown chocolates
 
✓ TV
 
✓ In-room coffee maker
In reality, guests rarely use telephones in their rooms or in the common area 
but before deciding not to have them you should consider the following:
 
✓ Incoming guest calls: Typically leisure travelers don’t receive many 
calls but your business travelers might, and you need to decide how to 
handle messages and incoming calls. Remember, they will tie up your 
business line when friends, family, and colleagues call the inn directly, 
unless the inn has an incoming guest telephone line.
 
✓ Cellphone coverage: If your area has poor cellphone reception, you 
should have in-room phones or a phone in the common area for guests 
to use. Also, international travelers frequently don’t have cellphone cov-
erage while traveling.
 
✓ Wake up calls: If you plan to offer wake-up service, you need to have in-
room phones to perform this service.
 
✓ Emergencies: If your system for guests to reach you after hours is by 
phone, you need to provide them with a phone to call you (either in 
their room or in the hallway).

171
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
Before picking amenities, create a budget and stick to it. Your guest rooms 
are a main feature of your B&B, and it’s easy to go overboard and overspend 
in your desire to provide the guest with a fabulous experience. You can start 
with the basics and add items as you go along. Make sure you’ve budgeted 
for all required code work and renovations before you shop for extra nice-to-
have features.
General guest room décor
You can scour decorating magazines to find out what styles are in and out 
for your guest rooms, but many professional designers recommend sticking 
to classic looks, which are always in style. Use trends sparingly to keep the 
room from looking dated too soon. Also, steer clear of wallpaper borders, 
dried flowers, knickknacks, faux finishes, and frilly window valances. Many 
people persist in decorating with these things, but the look tends to be dated.
 
Even if they fit the theme and personality of your B&B, don’t overdo the use of 
antiques and Victorian furniture and accessories in guest rooms, which 
shouldn’t feel like museums. The look can be busy, heavy, and fussy in a space 
that should be comfortable and restful.
Here are some tips on handling two significant elements of guest rooms:
 
✓ Artwork: If possible, display good-quality artwork — it doesn’t neces-
sarily have to be original art (if it’s a special piece, make sure it can’t be 
easily removed). Also consider the scale of artwork in the room: One 
or two larger pieces have much more impact and appeal than a lot of 
smaller, less expensive artwork (avoid small flowery prints in general). 
Many people make the mistake of hanging their artwork too high or plac-
ing a small, framed picture on a large wall or above the bed. Again, the 
scale and placement of art must balance with the setting.
 
✓ Accessories: A few well-chosen accessories are the key to making your 
rooms unique. The accessories you choose should add interest and 
color and accentuate the theme of the room or inn. For example, an 
interesting vase with flowers (choose pottery, china, or glass to fit your 
room décor), a coffee table book of the area, a tray or platter, and so on.
 
 Don’t go overboard with accessories. Too many accessories appear clut-
tered, and too much of a theme can look kitschy. Also, steer clear of 
shiny gold metal on picture frames, lamps, and other accessories; 
brushed or polished silver and bronze give things a newer look.
 
Consider your male guests when decorating guest rooms. Many men (espe-
cially business travelers) don’t feel particularly comfortable in rooms that are 
overly feminine. They prefer more neutral decorating styles with a polished, 
professional look.

172
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Making your beds
The bed is the focal point of the guest room and should make a statement 
by always being meticulously made. Hospital corners are the standard for 
making a bed. At the very least, each guest room should have the following 
bed-related items to ensure your guests get a good night’s sleep:
 
✓ A good quality mattress made for lodging: A mattress made for the 
lodging industry has a built-up edge spring to account for guests sit-
ting on the edge of the bed. The mattress should be medium to firm 
(definitely not too soft or too hard), and it should feel lush with a solid 
foundation. Try out mattresses before buying, and ask for referrals from 
other innkeepers about which mattresses their guests like. (Turn to 
Chapter 1 for information on innkeeper forums and resources.)
 
 Consider setting up an account with the lodging department of a mat-
tress company and buying your mattresses wholesale. You usually save 
up to 50 percent of the purchase price, with delivery included.
 
✓ A waterproof mattress cover: The best choice is a zippered one that 
encases the mattress entirely.
 
✓ A cover for the box spring: A bare box spring is unsightly and easily 
concealed. A bed skirt that coordinates with the linens does the job, 
or you can use a fitted sheet if you have a bed frame that you prefer to 
leave exposed.
 
✓ Three sets of sheets and pillowcases for each bed: You need one set for 
the bed, one for the laundry, and one for the closet. I get into the specif-
ics of bed linen quality later in this section.
 
✓ At least four pillows (two soft and two firm) per bed: Offering both soft 
and firm bed pillows accounts for guest preferences.
 
✓ Pillow protectors: This extra casing helps to protect your pillows from 
dust mites and allergens. (See www.innstyle.com for a selection.) 
Some are also waterproof.
 
✓ A headboard: The size of the headboard should be in balance with 
the bed, and proportionate to the size to the room. Headboards must 
be securely fastened to prevent wobbling as well as comfortable when 
guests prop themselves up in bed.
 
Consider the placement of the bed in the room. Set it up not only where it 
looks best when guests enter the room but also where it gives guests the best 
view in the room when they’re laying in bed. Also be sure not to place the bed 
where it blocks an air-conditioning or heating unit or where these may blow 
directly on the guests while they’re sleeping.

173
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
When you know what you must have regarding a guest bed, you can move 
on to making your selections and considering what, if any, luxuries you can 
afford. Keep in mind that many innkeepers start out with the essentials and 
add luxuries such as down comforters or higher-quality linens after they’ve 
been up and running for a while. The following points help guide your bed 
and linen decisions.
 
✓ Bed size: Even though you should definitely consider the size of the 
room when selecting a bed, king- and queen-size beds are by far the 
most popular.
 
 Two twin beds that can be made into a king bed allow you the extra flex-
ibility of creating a room with two beds. To do this, you must have two 
extra-long twin beds and use a mattress connecting kit. Innstyle (www.
innstyle.com) offers a Create-a-King kit that works well.
 
 King beds come in two sizes: A standard king bed is 76 inches wide by 80 
inches long, and a California king is 72 inches wide by 84 inches long. 
Bed linen choices are limited for California king beds, so get one only if 
it’s the only way to fit a king bed in the room.
 
✓ Size and design of bed linens: Before purchasing bed linens, make sure 
they will fit your mattress. Some pillow-top mattresses are thicker and 
may require special bedding (particularly fitted bed sheets). As for com-
forters and duvet covers, some manufacturers don’t take into account 
the added thickness of pillow-top mattresses, so look for oversized 
queen or king duvet covers and comforters so that the sides of your 
bedding aren’t visible when guests walk in the room.
 
 Choose bed coverings not only for their design but also their feel, dura-
bility, and washability. Soft, textured fabrics create a warm, cozy feel, 
whereas smooth, satiny fabrics produce a cooler sensation. You want 
the bed coverings to look coordinated, but don’t overdo it. Steer away 
from a bed-in-a-bag, in which you get a lot of pieces that all match — 
even window treatments! A few shams, decorative pillows, and/or bol-
sters are a nice luxurious touch and help to provide accents in the room; 
however, keep in mind that too many can crowd the bed and usually end 
up on the floor.
 
✓ Quality of bed linens: Bed linens can have a significant impact on the 
quality of a guest’s experience; the higher your room price, the more 
luxurious your sheets should feel. White, 100-percent-cotton sheets are 
the most common. Fine linens begin with fine cotton and linen quality 
is based on thread count (the number of threads per square inch) and 
the length of the fibers. The minimum thread count that you should con-
sider is 300. Egyptian and Pima cotton plants grow the longest fibers, so 
these sheets with high thread counts are considered the best quality. 
In addition to selecting sheets made with high-quality cotton, you need 
to consider the feel. Cotton sateen sheets are softer than those with a 
crisp, classic linen weave.

174
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Down (feather) comforter: This is definitely a luxury item because of the 
cost, but you’re likely to find a deal if you look hard enough. The higher 
the percentage of down, the lighter and warmer the comforter is. Protect 
your investment with a washable comforter cover called a duvet; it’s like 
a big pillowcase for the comforter, and you can get duvets in all sorts of 
colors and patterns — just like other bed coverings.
 
 Some guests may be allergic to down, so you should have several com-
forters in a down alternative, which look and feel like the real thing. 
Having a few sets (depending on the size of your inn) of hypo-allergenic 
pillows and down-alternative comforters on hand is recommended. Your 
reservation procedures should include asking guests about allergies 
(and not just food allergies) so that you can be prepared. Some inns 
make all their beds with down-alternative products just to be safe.
 
Always have extra blankets, duvets, comforters, pillow protectors, mattress 
covers, and pillows on hand in case of accidents or last-minute housekeeping 
needs. One set of extras per room is an investment you’ll be thankful for.
Finding functional furnishings
The furniture in your guest rooms must not only look good and fit your over-
all décor, but it also must be comfortable, functional, and sturdy.
An ideal guest room has
 
✓ A bedside table on each side of the bed.
 
✓ Reading lamps on the bedside tables (see the next section for more on 
guest room lighting).
 
✓ Ample closet space with hangers and/or a dresser or wardrobe.
 
✓ Two chairs and a table.
 
✓ A desk, table or workspace if you’re catering to business travelers. 
Finding tasteful but functional guest room desks that fit your décor can 
be a challenge. The key is to achieve a balance between appearance and 
functionality. For example, a guest may have trouble spreading out work 
papers and using a laptop on a Victorian roll-top desk.
When deciding on guest room furnishings, check for minimum requirements 
of rating and inspection agencies. For example, most require each guest room 
to have a nightstand or equivalent by each bed. Also, stop and think about 
whether your future goal is to obtain a AAA four- or five-diamond or other 
rating, such as Canada Select, membership in Select Registry, or a state asso-
ciation. All rating agencies have published guidelines. Perform a Web search 
to find their contact information and request an application and a list of their 
inspection and rating requirements for furnishings, lighting, and so on.

175
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
Your guest room furniture choices are determined by your target market, 
your budget, and the size and price of your rooms. Furnishing guest rooms is 
an ongoing process for most inns, and it’s important to remember that some-
thing doesn’t have to be expensive to look good.
Getting the lighting just right
Lighting can make a room, and a well-lit guest room makes the best first 
impression. Inadequate guest room lighting is an issue that many guests com-
plain about, so it’s best to over-light a room with plenty of lamps and overhead 
light fixtures than to under-light it. Each room should contain general lighting 
(an overhead fixture), task lighting (table and desk lamps), and mood light-
ing (small lamps or any other type of lighting) to create ambiance. Bedside 
lamps can be attached to the wall if space is limited, and must provide at least 
60-watt lighting. They should be of a size that creates balance with the bed and 
bedside table and be at a comfortable height for reading in bed.
 
Candles in guest rooms can be a fire hazard and violate most insurance poli-
cies. (Check with your insurance company for specifics.) A great alternative to 
this kind of mood lighting is attractive battery-operated candles. A variety of 
these flameless candles is on the market. Type “battery-operated candle” into 
your favorite Internet search engine if you’re not familiar with them.
Equally as important to adequate lighting is darkness to ensure a restful 
sleep. Whatever you use as window treatments should keep the light out. 
For example, draperies should be lined and to the floor. If guests are meant 
to pull them closed at night, they should be on rings or a mechanism that’s 
easily drawn.
Planning Great Bathrooms
Many people overlook bathrooms as a great place to wow guests. After all, 
guests spend a fair amount of time in their bathrooms. The amenities, fur-
nishings, and décor of your guest bathrooms go a long way toward making 
guests feel pampered at your inn.
Traditionally, B&Bs offer three types of bathroom settings: private in-room 
bathrooms, private baths (reserved just for one room) in the hallway, and 
shared bathrooms. Guests strongly prefer rooms with private in-room baths, 
and this is the most popular arrangement.

176
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Stocking bathroom amenities
You have some flexibility in the presentation of your guest bathrooms, but 
some amenities are simply necessities. Following are the most common bath-
room must-haves:
 
✓ Cotton balls and swabs: Consider presentation in attractive, covered 
glassware, baskets, or antique containers
 
✓ Tissues
 
✓ Mouthwash
 
✓ Soap and/or bath gel
 
✓ Makeup-remover pads
 
✓ Lotion
 
✓ Shampoo and conditioner
 
✓ Shower cap
 
✓ Hairdryer
 
✓ Individually wrapped rolls of quality two-ply toilet paper
 
✓ At least two bath towels, one hand towel, and one washcloth per guest
 
✓ Bathmat
 
✓ At least two sterilized drinking glasses in each bathroom
 
 Many innkeepers place the clean glasses upside down on nice paper doi-
lies instead of wrapping them in paper wrappers that have an industrial, 
hotel look.
Bathroom furnishings and décor
Avoid look-alike bathrooms. Instead, when possible, match the décor of your 
bathrooms to your rooms (which I assume will all look different). Let the 
expression of your room’s personality extend into your bathrooms by using 
pictures or accessories in the same theme as the room.
Here are some guidelines and recommendations for bathroom furnishings 
and décor that not only make great impressions on your guests but also, in 
some cases, help you maintain clean, quality bathrooms in your inn:
 
✓ Provide adequate lighting for shaving and applying makeup.
 
✓ Install large mirrors and makeup mirrors in the bathroom. An added 
bonus is that large mirrors help create the illusion of a bigger bathroom.

177
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
 
✓ Offer the most plush, absorbent towels your budget can afford.
 
 The towel color is up to you. However, white is considered luxurious. 
It’s also the easiest to maintain because you can bleach white towels 
when needed. If you choose other colors, beware of laundry issues such 
as fading and spotting. (I discuss laundry and other cleaning concerns in 
Chapter 13.)
 
 Avoid makeup stains on your towels by offering makeup remover pads 
or by placing dark-colored washcloths in bathrooms. The Inn at 
Riverbend (www.innatriverbend.com) in Pearisburg, Virginia, has 
had the word “Makeup” attractively embroidered on dark washcloths 
that compliment the color schemes of its bathrooms. Housekeeping staff 
places the washcloths on top of the towels, letting guests know not to 
use the white towels for makeup removal.
 
✓ Provide adequate hooks for guests to hang their towels on.
 
✓ Stock each bathroom with an amenities basket with common toiletry 
items guests may have forgotten, such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, dis-
posable razor, and the like.
 
 You’ll quickly find out whether the bathroom amenities basket works for 
your clientele and is appreciated or if guests simply take the items with 
them. If you find that guests take advantage of complimentary toiletries 
in the bathroom, you can opt to keep the items on hand and let guests 
know during their welcome tour that you have some of the most fre-
quently forgotten items if they’re needed.
 
✓ Use double-sided bath rugs and flip them over to cut washing in half. 
However, you must balance this convenience with safety; to prevent 
slipping, you may need to use mats with rubber backing. Unfortunately, 
rubber-backed mats need to be replaced more often than double-sided 
ones because the rubber wears off with frequent washings.
 
✓ Protect guests from slipping in the tub by providing rubber tub mats 
or applying grip strips to the tub.
 
 Bradford Place Inn and Gardens (www.bradfordplaceinn.com) 
in Sonora, California, creates a nice presentation by rolling up white 
bubble tub mats and tying them with raffia. Tub mats are placed so that, 
if guests choose not to use the mats, they must move them in order to 
get into showers or tubs. The mats are sprayed with a bleach cleaner, 
then rinsed and air-dried.
 
✓ Install anti-scald valves on all guest showers.
 
If you’re not able to offer in-room bathrooms, in addition to offering clean 
bathrobes and slippers in guest rooms, prepare a basket with personal items 
that guests can easily carry to the bathroom. Be sure to leave room in the 
basket so they can add some of their own toiletries.

178
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Considerations for bathrooms 
under construction
If you’re in the planning stage of your bed & breakfast and are either con-
structing bathrooms or simply renovating them, consider these tips for creat-
ing fabulous bathrooms:
 
✓ Flooring: Pick a color or design that doesn’t show every little hair. If you 
choose a tile floor, choose a good-quality, non-porous tile with an inter-
esting but classic design. Lighter, neutral colors stand the test of time 
and match almost any décor.
 
 Larger tiles mean less grout to keep clean. And textured tiles help keep 
bath rugs and guests from skidding, although they may be harder to 
keep clean.
 
 You may also want to consider linoleum for flooring material, because 
it’s softer and warmer than tile, and if a guest drops something break-
able, the item isn’t likely to break on linoleum.
 
✓ Tubs: Double whirlpool tubs (either in guest rooms or in bathrooms) are 
the most requested amenities, but soaker tubs without the water move-
ment are becoming a popular, quieter, and more sanitary alternative. 
Many come in double sizes that appeal to the romantic getaway market.
 
 To be greener, choose compact model tubs that use less water.
 
 Whirlpool tubs are popular with guests, but they’re not right for every 
inn. Consider the type of guest you’re trying to attract, and then get 
advice from innkeepers with similar inns and weigh the decision for 
yourself. You need to consider that they do have the potential to cause a 
lot of plumbing and leaking problems. They also can be noisy, so locate 
them accordingly and plan for extra insulation in and around the tubs 
and in the walls to avoid disturbing other guests in the rooms below 
or next door. When shopping for whirlpool tubs, check with other inn-
keepers in the innkeeper forums (see Chapter 1 for help in finding an 
innkeeper forum) about the different types of tubs, some of which are 
easier to clean than others. If you opt for whirlpool tubs, read the manu-
facturer’s instructions to find out what products are safe for the tubs 
(such as bath oils), and set your policies accordingly. Also follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and maintenance of the tubs, 
and check with your health department for specific cleaning standards 
that you must follow.
 
✓ Fixtures: Avoid ordinary-looking fixtures. Selecting interesting fixtures, 
possibly even something dramatic, depending on the size of the bath-
room, is an inexpensive way to dress up the appearance of your 
bathrooms.

179
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
 
 Select the same style of faucets, showerheads, toilets, doorknobs, locks, 
toilet seats, emergency lighting, smoke detectors, and other smaller 
hardware and accessories. If you can’t get multiples of the same item, 
opt for similar styles because consistency lets you stockpile repair and 
replacement parts and supplies.
 
✓ Vanities: If you use lovely pedestal-style sinks in your guest rooms, you 
have to provide other shelf space for the guests’ use. Remember, guests 
need countertop space for their cosmetic and toiletry bags; a minimum 
4-foot space is recommended for vanities or alternate counter space in 
the case of pedestal sinks.
Making Guests at Home 
in Common Areas
Creating an inviting and comfortable place for your guests to gather or relax 
on their own is a distinguishing feature that bed & breakfasts offer over tra-
ditional hotels. For many guests, it’s one of the nice extras that compel them 
to choose your inn again or become devoted B&B travelers. Your common 
areas are the places to let your hospitality skills shine by anticipating guest 
needs and wants. Choose the furnishings and amenities accordingly. For 
example, if your inn is in a remote area where guests come to relax, unplug, 
and get away, think carefully before putting a flat screen TV in your common 
area. Additionally, consider whether guests even want to watch TV together, 
given their different preferences.
 
Your common areas may also include dining areas, particularly if your inn is 
smaller and you need to take advantage of the extra space. For example, you 
may encourage guests to enjoy card games or board games at the cleared 
dining table. You can find out more about setting up dining areas (particularly 
the breakfast setting) in Chapter 10.
Your service, architecture, and décor are the most distinguishing features of 
your B&B, so choose amenities and furnishings that fit with these features 
and contribute to the personality and experience you’re trying to create for 
your guests. Here are some tips for furnishing your common areas:
 
✓ Consider the purpose of each room or outdoor space. Choose durable 
furnishings that look inviting yet fit the ambiance of the area.
 
✓ Arrange furniture groupings based on your target market. Furniture can 
be placed to encourage either group interaction or more private settings.

180
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Provide adequate lighting with overhead fixtures and individual 
lamps. Lighting should reflect the time of day: brighter during the day 
and more subdued at night when you want the space to look more calm-
ing and relaxing. Be sure outdoor areas that are used by guests in the 
evening are adequately lit and provide umbrellas or awnings so that 
they are properly shaded during the day.
 
✓ Keep a fire going to add warmth (both literally and figuratively) to a 
common space if you have a fireplace. Of course, whether or not you 
use a fireplace depends on your location and the time of year.
 
✓ Stock up on cards and board games, and set out up-to-date magazines 
and newspapers.
 
✓ Start with a phone in the common area if you don’t provide phones in 
the guest rooms. (See the earlier section, “Offering the most requested 
amenities,” for help in deciding about telephones in guest rooms.) After 
you’ve been open for a short time, you can assess your guests’ telephone 
needs and add in-room phones or remove the one in the common area 
accordingly.
 
✓ Offer complimentary refreshments. Guests appreciate hot and cold bev-
erages and snacks available 24 hours a day. Afternoon refreshments, after-
dinner drinks, and/or desserts are also common offerings at B&Bs, and 
they encourage social interaction between your guests in common spaces.
 
 Research local liquor laws and licensing requirements when deciding 
what to serve.
 
✓ Offer your guests the use of a microwave and a small guest refrigerator 
in a common area. This discourages them from asking to use yours and 
alleviates the mess of cooking and eating in guest rooms (which many inn-
keepers discourage). Guests often enjoy a place to heat up snacks or light 
meals and a place to keep beverages cold. These common area amenities 
are particularly helpful if there are limited eating establishments nearby 
or if guests stay for more than a few days at a time.
 
✓ Create a lending library for guests to borrow and recycle books. You 
may want to invite guests to take a book and leave a book. Begin your 
collection with your own books and build it by visiting public library 
sales and used book stores.
 
✓ Establish a video/DVD library if you have VCR or DVD players for 
guests to watch movies in their rooms.
 
✓ Display maps and local brochures, and keep plenty of copies on hand 
for guests.
 
✓ Create and display a book of menus from nearby restaurants.

181
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
 
 Only include restaurants that you’ve been to or that other guests have 
recommended. Sharing the menus with guests serves as an indirect, but 
still personal, recommendation and factors into guests’ experiences at 
your inn.
 
✓ Make wireless Internet access available throughout the inn (includ-
ing in guest rooms), but if possible, set up at least one guest computer 
with Internet access in your common area.
 
✓ Install umbrellas to add a nice touch. They not only provide comfort 
but they also give an upscale first impression to arriving guests. Solid 
colored umbrellas seem more high-end than patterned ones.
Safety Considerations
As an innkeeper, making your bed & breakfast safe for all guests is a pri-
mary and ongoing concern. Some precautions taken to keep guests safe and 
comfortable are practical considerations such as adequate lighting, tucked-
away cords, nailed-down floorboards, sturdy railings, and so on, and others 
are mandated by law. Your goal should be to know fire, health, and zoning 
requirements even better than the inspectors so that you can provide com-
fortable and safe accommodations for your guests and avoid hassles and 
headaches when the inspectors come calling.
In addition to meeting local ordinances, be familiar with your insurance poli-
cies and their safety requirements in order to be sure you’re covered in the 
event a guest is injured at your inn. (Chapter 3 has information on protecting 
your business with insurance.)
This section explores safety elements with regard to lighting and posting 
notices for guests.
Proper lighting
Even seemingly safe areas can be dangerous if they’re poorly lit. Proper light-
ing not only shows your inn in a better light (no pun intended), but it also 
keeps your guests safe.
 
Assess the practicality of your lighting. Conduct thorough walk-throughs of 
your inn at all hours of the day and night to check lighting. For safety, you 
should answer “yes” to all the following questions regarding safe lighting:

182
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Do each guest room and each bathroom have a nightlight?
 
✓ Is there adequate lighting for guests who are coming and going late at 
night and for those who depart early in the morning (before sunrise)?
 
✓ Do guests using hall bathrooms during the night have enough light to 
safely find them?
 
✓ Are electric cords to table and floor lamps neatly coiled and out of 
the way?
 
✓ Are light switches easy to find in guest rooms?
 
 Point out light switches during your walk-through with guests when they 
check in.
 
✓ If you offer 24-hour snacks, is there adequate lighting for guests to safely 
get to them?
 
✓ If you have an outdoor area that guests can enjoy in the evening, are the 
path to it and the space itself adequately lit?
It’s important to know and follow local ordinances and requirements regard-
ing lighting in your inn. Contact your city hall to see which agency is respon-
sible for your licensing. It may be the fire department, the board of health, 
the zoning board, or some combination. Also check for additional state or 
federal requirements.
Certain lighting is required to obtain your certificate of occupancy, and light-
ing requirements may be determined by square footage of your rooms. Also, 
emergency lighting may be required in guest rooms, hallways, staircases, and 
at exits.
Required notices
Many required notices definitely don’t fit in with the look and feel of the bed 
& breakfast environment. Putting up a big red EXIT sign may conflict with 
your decorating plans, but complying with the law and keeping guests safe is 
a necessary part of the business — and it makes guests feel that the inn takes 
their safety seriously. In addition to lighted exit signs, fire extinguishers need 
to be clearly visible — check with your local fire inspector for requirements 
in your area.
 
In many areas, you’re required to post a map of exits on the backs of guest 
room doors. You can soften the look slightly by putting these in attractive 
frames that hang on the backs of the doors.

183
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
Shopping for Your Inn
As you get ready to make the purchases you’ve planned for, I caution you to 
keep your budget in mind and encourage you to consult other innkeepers so 
that you can learn from their experiences.
Finding suppliers who understand 
the needs of B&Bs
Numerous suppliers specifically cater to the bed & breakfast industry. They 
understand the needs of your guests and the size of your orders, and they 
make a conscious effort to support you, the innkeeper, as their customer.
Don’t overlook the value of a great deal by shopping in discount stores and 
bargain hunting. However, sometimes it makes sense to buy from vendors 
who understand and support the industry. Following are some ways to find 
industry vendors who are knowledgeable about your needs:
 
✓ Ask your local and state B&B associations for a list of vendors who may 
offer a discount to members of your association.
 
✓ Consult the list provided by the Professional Association of Innkeepers 
International at www.paii.org: Click Resources, then Vendor 
Marketplace, and then select a vendor category. If you’re a member of 
the association, be sure to ask for the PAII (pronounced “pie”) discount 
if you purchase from any of the vendors listed on the site.
 
✓ Ask other innkeepers and search industry forums (see Chapter 1 for 
information on finding these forums) for information on vendors that 
other innkeepers have ordered from.
Creating your shopping list for appliances, 
furniture, and supplies
It’s important to distinguish your shopping list from your wish list in order 
to stay on budget (see Chapter 3 for help in budgeting for purchases). It’s 
okay to maintain a wish list, but be realistic about when and which furnish-
ing purchases make sense based on the plan you created for your business. 
Your shopping list should include priority appliances and furniture that make 
your life easier and the guest experience better as well as essential supplies 

184
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
to have on hand. Keep an ongoing shopping list (and a separate wish list) to 
write down things as you think of them, not just in the planning process but 
also in the day-to-day operation of your B&B.
Choosing appliances that make your life easier
When choosing appliances for your bed & breakfast,
 
✓ Choose good-quality, easy-to-use appliances that will stand up to con-
stant use (more use than in a typical household). Paying more for qual-
ity pays off in the long run.
 
✓ Choose appliances that are quiet so there’s less disturbance to guests.
Following is a list of many common appliances in B&Bs — some more 
common than others. Note that some of the appliances listed, such as warm-
ing drawers and convection ovens, are expensive. Only you can determine 
how important they are to your operation and whether they fit into your 
budget.
 
✓ Blender
 
✓ Bread maker
 
✓ Coffee grinder
 
✓ Coffee maker
 
✓ Convection oven
 
✓ Corkscrew(s)
 
✓ Electric can opener
 
✓ Electric mixer
 
✓ Electric skillet
 
✓ Electric water kettle
 
✓ Fans
 
✓ Food processor
 
✓ Freezer
 
✓ Juice extractor
 
✓ Microwave
 
✓ Refrigerator
 
✓ Stove/oven/grill
 
✓ Toaster oven
 
✓ Toaster(s)
 
✓ Waffle iron
 
✓ Warming drawer (for keeping 
food warm without overcook-
ing it while you’re preparing 
other items)
 
Consult several of the resources for buying furniture later in this chapter, as 
these outlets also carry appliances at reasonable prices.
Buying furniture
You can save a great deal of money (and maybe buy more with the money 
you save) if you’re patient and creative about where you shop for furniture. 
The key considerations when buying furniture for your inn are

185
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
 
✓ Price
 
✓ Quality
 
✓ Buying only what fits the look and feel of your inn
 
✓ Functionality
 
Purchase a good selection of quality furniture pieces, particularly wood furni-
ture, sofas, and chairs. You can mix in antiques and used shabby chic finds for 
a great eclectic look, but you shouldn’t rely solely on used and old-looking 
items if you want a quality B&B that guests will rave about.
No matter the style of your inn, your furniture doesn’t have to be expensive 
to serve its function and make a good impression on guests. Here are some 
ideas about where to get started:
 
✓ Check local thrift and antique shops. Stop in often to see what they 
have, and make friends with the owners and employees, who can be 
great resources for inside information. I recommend that you stop in 
when you’re looking for something in particular and say, “I’m on the 
lookout for . . . let me know if you see something.”
 
✓ Enter “hotel liquidators” into your favorite Internet search engine, and 
investigate the results. These companies handle the liquidation of top-
quality hotel furnishings when hotels remodel. If you’re lucky, you’ll find 
one within driving distance. Call ahead to inquire about any minimum 
purchase restrictions so that, for example, you don’t have to buy identical 
mirrors for all your rooms but rather can mix and match pieces.
 
 No matter how good of a deal you find on furnishings, you should only 
buy individual pieces that fit the style of your inn. Don’t be tempted by a 
bargain and end up with a corporate, hotel look!
 
✓ Search for items on eBay (www.ebay.com). You can narrow your 
search field to items available for pickup in your local area in order to 
save on shipping if you’re looking at large pieces of furniture.
 
✓ Look into Habitat for Humanity ReStores (search for locations near you 
at www.habitat.org/env/restores). They sell appliances, furniture, 
plumbing and electric fixtures, and more quality used and surplus build-
ing materials at a fraction of normal prices. Proceeds from ReStores help 
local affiliates fund the construction of Habitat houses within the com-
munity. (I found out about this resource from an innkeeper when I was 
searching the PAII members’ forum — see, it pays off!)
 
If you scrimp on too many furnishings, your inn will reflect it. Your furniture is 
a necessary part of your business, and it needs to be viewed as a good invest-
ment. Instead, save money on accessories; you can get plenty of less expen-
sive ones that still look great.

186
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Making the Innkeepers’ Quarters 
Cozy and Private
In setting up your B&B, the bulk of your resources will go to furnishing the 
areas that guests see and occupy. Despite this, I encourage you to give seri-
ous thought to your private quarters. If you’re buying a new inn, carefully 
consider the size and layout of your quarters. If you’re already an innkeeper, 
pull back and reevaluate your quarters. Ask yourself what you can do to 
make your area better and more comfortable. Perhaps a fresh coat of paint or 
some new bedding will be the little change that makes a big difference in the 
feeling you get when you enter your home.
It’s also very important that guests know where the inn starts and where it 
ends and where your personal space begins. In order to communicate this, 
the boundaries first must be clearly defined in your mind. Natural physical 
boundaries such as doors that you can lock are a step in the right direction, 
but oftentimes they’re not enough. Here are some ideas to create further sep-
aration for your personal space in the kitchen and in your personal quarters:
 
✓ The kitchen: Your personal space can include the kitchen, where you’re 
likely to spend a fair amount of time prepping and fixing meals. True, 
some innkeepers enjoy guests visiting the kitchen, but for most it’s a dis-
traction and guests are only in the way. Here are some suggestions for 
keeping the kitchen off-limits to guests:
 
✓ Air freshener
 
✓ Batteries
 
✓ Cleaning supplies
 
✓ Extension cords
 
✓ Extra amenities
 
✓ First-aid supplies
 
✓ Flashlights
 
✓ Insect repellant
 
✓ Light bulbs
 
✓ Memo pads and pens or 
pencils for guest use
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Sunscreen
 
✓ Tape
 
✓ Tissues
 
✓ Toilet paper
 
✓ Toilet plungers
Keeping essential supplies on hand
It’s impossible to be prepared for everything, but part of the job of innkeeper 
is anticipating guests’ needs and requests. The following list gets you started 
thinking about additional supplies to have on hand to keep your B&B well-
stocked and properly furnished.

187
 Chapter 9: Furnishing Your Inn 
 
• Close the door. If your kitchen doesn’t have a door, install one. A 
Dutch door is effective at closing off the space but still allowing 
limited interactions with the innkeeper.
 
• Post a sign on the door or explain the restriction to guests. Many 
innkeepers simply post a sign that says “Private.” Other innkeep-
ers politely tell guests, “The health department doesn’t allow 
guests in the kitchen.” Innkeepers who have used the line, “Anyone 
who comes in the kitchen is put to work” have found it ineffective 
because many guests don’t mind helping.
 
• Lock the door from the inside. A lock on the inside of the kitchen 
door helps to close the kitchen to guests while you’re cooking as 
well as prevents the refrigerator from being raided by snackers 
throughout the day and during the night.
 
✓ Innkeeper’s quarters: This area is your home, and only those who are 
invited should enter, but sometimes guests need reminding. Here are 
some suggestions for drawing the line:
 
• Use locks on the doors and post a notice or sign that reads 
“Private Innkeeper’s Quarters.”
 
• When practical and tasteful, use shrubbery, fences or gates to 
create a physical barrier so that guests are prevented from easily 
encroaching onto your private patio or other outdoor areas that 
are strictly for you and your family.
 
• If possible, establish a private entrance to your quarters (as well as 
access through the inn) so that you can come and go without walk-
ing in the common areas of the inn. A secret way of escape allows 
you to get away from the inn for errands, appointments, and meet-
ings without being seen and stopped by guests — or you can just 
escape to enjoy an evening out.
 
Because you’ll be spending time in your private quarters, separate from your 
guests, and away from the inn, make sure that guests know how to reach you. 
Tell guests when they check in how to reach you (cellphone, private phone 
number, intercom, and so on) and make sure this information is available to 
them. Some ways to do this are by making cards for the guest rooms, includ-
ing the information in a welcome letter or in guest information booklets in 
their rooms, posting your number beside telephones, and so on.
 
Put yourself in the mindset of wanting guests to feel comfortable at your 
B&B — your business — rather than comfortable in your home. This slight 
distinction can help you separate the business space of the B&B from the 
personal space of your home.

T
he breakfast that you serve your guests is 
just as important as the bed you provide 
them. After all, breakfast is half of the bed & 
breakfast experience! In the B&B world, creating 
fabulous, memorable breakfasts for your guests 
is imperative.
In this chapter, I help you pick a breakfast setting and style that fits your 
inn’s image and appeals to the type of guests your inn caters to. I give you 
tips on menu planning and food preparation, and I share some menus and 
recipes that are proven guest favorites.
Setting the Breakfast Scene
When your guests tell friends about their stay at your bed & breakfast, no 
doubt their impressions and memories of the morning meal will be included. 
Breakfast is an opportunity to let your hospitality shine through by creating a 
comfortable and inviting breakfast setting. The style of breakfast you choose 
to serve also influences your guests’ experiences. You have several choices 
with regard to both setting and style.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Creating an appealing breakfast setting
One of the decisions you need to make regarding the breakfast setting is 
whether you want to offer it only in your inn’s dining room or give guests the 
option of having breakfast privately in their own rooms. In the dining room 
setting, you need to choose between individual party seating and group 
seating. Descriptions of these options follow:
 
✓ Individual party seating: Many inns offer tables for two which can be 
easily combined to accommodate groups traveling together. This type of 
seating is more private than group seating arrangements.
 
✓ Group seating: In a group seating arrangement, guests are seated 
together at one table in the dining room. This type of seating is common 
at many B&Bs. In fact, for many guests a popular aspect of the bed & 
breakfast experience is interacting with other interesting people over 
breakfast. Group seating encourages conversation and provides a more 
family-like atmosphere.
 
✓ In-room service: While some innkeepers offer breakfast in bed, you need 
to remember that when guests eat in bed, food will be spilled on sheets, 
blankets, comforters, and pillows. Instead, when designing or decorat-
ing your inn, you may want to consider adding space for in-room dining. 
This usually consists of a seating area with a table and two chairs. Some 
innkeepers find that in-room service is actually easier on them because 
once the guests are served, they’re taken care of.
Several factors contribute to your setting choices. Consider the following as 
they apply to your inn:
 
✓ Space: The amount of space you have may determine the type of set-
ting you opt for. If your space is limited, you may be confined to a group 
seating arrangement because one large table requires less space than 
multiple, individual-party tables.
 
✓ Inn design: If your inn has areas that are appropriate for outdoor seat-
ing, such as porches or patios, these venues may make comfortable and 
relaxing settings for breakfast, weather permitting. However, be sure to 
factor in extra efforts on your part that serving breakfast outside may 
entail. Things to consider are:
 
• Keeping food warm
 
• Serving guests together
 
• Providing shade for guests
 
• Keeping chairs and tables clean
 
• Finding space for tray stands that don’t interfere with normal 
traffic patterns

191
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
• Being organized to avoid needless trips back and forth for forgot-
ten items if the space is not near the kitchen
 
✓ Types of guests: Your guests’ purpose in coming to your inn may 
determine the type of setting they’re likely to enjoy most. For example, 
couples on a romantic getaway often prefer individual party seating or 
in-room service to group seating arrangements. Guests traveling on 
business or those wanting to get a jump-start on the day may prefer to 
forgo a formal breakfast in favor of an early, quick continental breakfast 
or in-room service.
Selecting a style of breakfast to offer
According to the Professional Association of Innkeepers International’s 
Industry Study of Operations and Finance, over 70 percent of inns offer a full 
breakfast with a set menu, but this doesn’t mean that you have to. You may 
choose to offer a continental breakfast, breakfast cooked to order, or a buffet 
instead. You may even decide to vary the style of breakfast you serve: full 
breakfast on weekends and holidays and a continental breakfast during the 
week, for example. The choice is up to you — as long as you abide by local 
zoning laws and make sure your guests know what to expect by describing 
breakfast on your Web site and in your advertising.
 
✓ Continental breakfast: Innkeepers use a variety of definitions to define 
continental breakfasts, which can range from a very simple selection of 
juice, muffins, and coffee to more elaborate offerings such as hot oatmeal, 
a selection of cereals, pastries, coffees, and teas. Some innkeepers offer a 
continental plus, or extended continental, breakfast which includes all the 
previously named selections and one hot item, such as a tray of French 
toast. Typically, a continental breakfast would be self-serve, buffet style. 
Continental breakfast is often preferred by those who want to be up and 
out early, such as business travelers, skiers, golfers, and so on.
 
✓ Full breakfast with a set menu: This breakfast style allows you the most 
flexibility to exercise your creativity and presentation skills and offers the 
added benefit of being adaptable for advance planning and preparation on 
your part! A full breakfast menu typically consists of a fruit course, a main 
course, and fresh baked goods along with a selection of coffees, teas, and 
juices. A variety of cereals, granola, and yogurt are also usually available. 
Many innkeepers rotate daily between sweet and savory menu themes. On 
the plus side, guests enjoy the upscale feeling of being served; however, 
vivacious as well as picky eaters often prefer a bountiful buffet.
 
✓ Full breakfast cooked to order: Some innkeepers give guests a choice 
of breakfast selections (within reason). For example, a combination 
of custom-made omelets, various styles of egg preparation, pancakes, 
French toast, bacon, or sausage are popular choices guests can choose 
from when ordering. The bigger your inn is and the more guests you 
need to serve at once, the more difficult this becomes.

192
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Buffet: Breakfast buffets can be as simple as the continental breakfast 
previously described or elaborate spreads with several entrée choices. 
Offering breakfast buffet-style makes it easier to offer guests flexible 
breakfast times; however, see cost and space considerations later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Cook your own breakfast: Some properties offer a cook-your-own break-
fast where the innkeeper provides kitchen facilities and the ingredients 
for breakfast. These properties are generally vacation rentals and are 
not usually considered bed & breakfasts. It is not uncommon, however, 
for a B&B to offer a variety of accommodations, for example, B&B rooms 
inside the main house where the innkeeper prepares and serves break-
fast and cabins or cottages on the grounds where guests can prepare 
their own breakfast as well as other meals.
Before you decide what style of breakfast to serve, know your guests. Ask 
yourself why guests are visiting your inn. Are guests primarily coming to your 
inn for business purposes, for an active vacation, for sightseeing, or for a relax-
ing getaway? Are they coming for a romantic getaway or will they want to chat 
with you and other guests? The answers to these questions will help you to 
pick the style that best suits your guests. Those who need to get up and out 
prefer continental and early buffet breakfasts, while guests looking for relax-
ation savor the feeling of being served. When romance is in the air, individual 
seating is preferred, whereas guests who enjoy meeting other guests prefer 
group seating arrangements. Here are some other things to keep in mind when 
choosing the type and style of breakfast to serve to your guests:
 
✓ Zoning and health department codes: Some areas prohibit cooking for 
guests and only a continental breakfast of prepared foods may be 
served. Local innkeepers are usually knowledgeable on zoning regula-
tions; however, you shouldn’t rely on them. Check with city hall for 
direction. You’ll usually be dealing with a zoning or planning board 
along with the local health department. You’ll also need to check for 
state conformance policies, although zoning issues are normally 
handled at the local level.
 
✓ Space: Guests’ comfort and safety play a major role in determining your 
breakfast setting. Guests must have enough room to move around. For 
example, maneuvering a buffet may be difficult in smaller spaces. You 
don’t want your guests squeezing between tables and pieces of furniture 
to get to and around the buffet.
 
✓ Room rates: Generally, the higher your room rates are, the more 
elaborate of a breakfast your guests will expect.
 
✓ Cost: Naturally, the more food you prepare the greater the cost. For 
example, when serving a buffet breakfast, you need to prepare a suf-
ficient amount of every item to ensure that guests who take generous 

193
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
servings leave enough for your other guests. Leftovers, however, are 
typically wasted, and this is something you don’t have much control 
over. With a plated breakfast, you control the serving sizes.
Designating breakfast times
There is no right or wrong time to serve breakfast to your guests. The only 
rule is to designate the time (or times) when breakfast will be served, so that 
you can prepare accordingly and your guests know what to expect. Figuring 
out breakfast times is a blend between what works for you and what your 
typical guests want. Here are some popular choices:
 
✓ A set breakfast time: If you plan to serve a sit-down, plated breakfast, 
one set breakfast time usually works best. Typically, innkeepers pick 
a set time to serve breakfast between 8:30 a.m. and 10 a.m. At check-in 
they remind guests that breakfast will be served in the dining room at 9 
a.m., for example. Be sure to allow enough time between breakfast and 
check-out.
 
✓ A flexible breakfast time: You may decide to offer guests a flexible time 
period during which to have breakfast (for example, between 8:30 and 
9:30 a.m. or 9 and 10 a.m., again, being mindful of your check-out time). 
This creates more work for you, but some innkeepers find that this 
flexibility distinguishes their inn from other B&Bs in the area.
 
 If you want to give guests a choice of breakfast times, consider limiting 
your menu to a few choices that you serve on a daily basis. Bradford Place 
Inn and Gardens (www.bradfordplaceinn.com), a four-room B&B in 
Sonora, California, offers the same three breakfast entrees daily — two are 
savory and one is sweet. The breakfast menu is posted on the inn’s Web 
site and guests are given the printed menu upon arrival to indicate where, 
when, and what they would like to eat. Entrees are built individually at the 
time of cooking, so it’s easy to accommodate virtually any type of diet or 
whim with little or no advance notice. This menu style works well for 
guests who are early breakfast eaters, light eaters, picky eaters, and late-
morning eaters, as well as those who have health, social, or religious 
dietary restrictions because guests always get what they want. The inn-
keeper is happy because individual dietary issues are automatically han-
dled, menu planning is eliminated, and food shopping requires less 
planning.
 
✓ Light early breakfast: For business travelers or guests departing early, 
you may want to offer a lighter option such as juice, coffee, cereal, 
and muffins. You can make guests who need to depart very early very 
happy with only a little bit of advance preparation on your part. The 
night before:

194
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
• Set up a coffeepot on a timer.
 
• Set out a hot pot for boiling water.
 
• Put out cereal, tea selections, and condiments.
 
• Set out dishes, mugs, glasses, utensils, and napkins.
 
• Arrange non-perishable, wrapped baked goods in a basket.
 
• Pour juices and milk into covered pitchers and leave in guest 
refrigerator.
 
✓ Different times on weekends and mid-week: You may decide to offer a 
later breakfast on weekends if you find this is what your guests prefer.
 
It’s a good idea to post the breakfast time or time period on your Web site 
(flexible breakfast times are used by some inns as a marketing tool). Also 
mention the breakfast time in the reservation process and in the confirmation 
letter: for example, “A full breakfast is served in our dining room daily at 9 
a.m.” Show guests where breakfast is served during your welcome tour of the 
inn, and remind them of breakfast times. Some inns also include it in the guest 
room welcome letter and state it in a nicely framed sign in the dining parlor or 
hospitality room.
 
If you offer in-room dining as a breakfast option, be clear about the times it is 
available, and when guests’ orders must be placed by.
How you handle the guest who slides in just as you’ve finished serving 
breakfast is your decision, and may differ based on circumstances. Many 
innkeepers don’t wait for guests and give a gentle knock on the door when 
a guest doesn’t show up for breakfast at the set time. Others prepare the 
guest’s breakfast and keep it warm. Many anticipate this (as it is guaranteed 
to happen) and plan to close the kitchen “officially” a half hour after the 
stated breakfast time so they can accommodate late arrivals and still stay on 
schedule. Depending on the situation, some innkeepers forgo the preparation 
of any hot entree and offer a simpler breakfast or pack a breakfast to go if the 
time is approaching check-out.
 
No matter what time you decide to serve breakfast, set up coffee and tea the 
night before to accommodate early risers.
Attending to the daily details
Presentation is a key ingredient to meeting guests’ expectations, and this is 
where every detail that goes into the table preparation, the ambiance, and 
serving techniques is critical. Here are some tips for daily finishing touches 
that ensure breakfast is served in the atmosphere that you want to create for 
your guests:

 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
✓ Table settings and placement are key, so have everything on the 
table that you will need, including salt and pepper shakers, a basket 
or attractive container of sugar and sweeteners and cream for at least 
every two or three guests, utensils, plates, glasses, mugs, napkins, juice 
and water pitchers, and so on.
 
✓ Practice serving guests. Guests are impressed when you serve without 
wasting a motion. Practice ahead of time how you will bring hot entrees 
to the table, which side of the guest you’ll place the food from, and 
which side you’ll remove their plates from. If you are serving more than 
one course, decide ahead of time how you’ll remove the first-course 
dishes and where you’ll stack them. Will you bring the dirty dishes into 
the kitchen before bringing the next course to guests?
 
 It’s a good idea to have a hostess staging area, such as a rolling tea cart 
or a tray stand, next to the table so that you can temporarily stack dirty 
dishes and utensils away from food that has not yet been served.
 
Soft background music can set the mood and also entertain guests who may 
be enjoying a cup of coffee or tea if you are still in the kitchen doing final 
breakfast preparations.
 
Music played in a commercial establishment must be licensed. An economi-
cal way to offer music is to subscribe to the commercial version of Sirius 
satellite radio.
Serving up something special
Breakfast is one of the many features that makes a bed & breakfast more than 
just a place to sleep and separates B&Bs from hotels. When guests wake up 
and smell your coffee brewing and your breads baking, they know they are 
waking up someplace special and have made the right choice in choosing 
your inn.
The ambiance that you create around the breakfast setting adds to your 
guests’ experience. Subtle touches can make your breakfast presentation 
special. For example, you might
 
✓ Offer a gourmet breakfast on china, sometimes even by candlelight.
 
✓ Garnish plates with fresh fruit, edible flowers, and sauces.
 
✓ Accessorize with fun and interesting table and glassware.
 
✓ Create menus around regional and local themes, such as southwestern 
cuisine or, if your inn is located on a farm or in a rural area, full country 
breakfasts.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Planning the Big Meal
Breakfast is an opportunity for you to wow your guests with your sensational 
recipes and culinary skills (don’t worry; you don’t have to be a master chef to 
serve an impressive breakfast). What you serve for breakfast impacts you, in 
terms of how much work it is, as well as your guests, in terms of how good it is 
and the degree to which it entices them to make a return visit or recommend 
your inn to others. Guest referrals naturally affect your business, as do the 
ingredients, the cost of which have an immediate impact on your bottom line.
You’re likely to have a variety of favorite recipes and certain combinations of 
foods that you like to serve together. You may decide to have set menus that 
you serve on a rotating basis.
 
Be careful to have enough variety so that guests staying multiple days are not 
served the same thing twice.
Presenting the fabulous breakfast you want to serve to your guests requires 
planning, preparation, and practice. In the next sections I help you pull it all 
together with tips, suggestions, and ideas to make breakfast one of the many 
pleasant memories of your guests’ visit.
Putting together menus and shopping lists
Planning your menus at least one week ahead of time helps you with your 
shopping so you’re not left scrambling anything but eggs at the last minute. 
The innkeepers at the Inn at Riverbend in Pearisburg, Virginia, created the 
chart in Figure 10-1, which allows you to see a week at a glance and makes it 
easy to create your shopping list. Use this example to create your own table.
The type of shopping you do depends on where you live and the size of your 
inn. No matter what, however, you need to
 
✓ Keep a running list of items you need.
 
✓ Make sure to keep certain “must-have” items on hand. (See Table 10-1 
for a list.)
 
✓ Serve your guests local, fresh items as well as items that they can’t get 
at home. Shop locally. You might visit farmers’ markets or a local coffee 
roaster.
 
 Guests love fresh fruits and vegetables of the season. Serving seasonal 
selections when they’re readily available is often less expensive than 
buying out-of-season items that need to be shipped in. Some fruits, such 
as blueberries, freeze well, so you can wash, dry, and freeze them when 
they’re in abundance.

197
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
✓ Buy in bulk when you can.
 
✓ Check into the feasibility of ordering from a food distributor, either on 
your own or by combining your order with those of other local inns. The 
savings can be substantial, and distributors usually deliver.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
Fruit can rarely be served the day that it’s purchased because it needs time 
to ripen. If you plan to serve cantaloupe, for example, make sure you pur-
chase it a few days ahead of time so that it’s mouth-watering and juicy when 
you serve it.
 
Generally, a serving size of fruit is 1/2 cup, not including garnish — for example, 
one-sixth of a medium cantaloupe served as melon balls. For hot entrees, allow 
two eggs if scrambled and at least 2 pieces of bacon, sausage, or Canadian ham 
if you serve meat. Sweet entrees, such as pancakes, waffles, and French toast, 
are usually served in smaller portions — for example, two pancakes or two 
pieces of French toast — and can be served along with something savory, as 
simple as a scrambled egg with grilled sliced peaches on the side. As you go 
along, you’ll get a feel for how much your guests eat, and you can adjust your 
serving sizes accordingly.
Keeping basic ingredients on hand
As an innkeeper, you quickly learn to expect the unexpected and to be pre-
pared for it. When it comes to breakfast, this means keeping an ample supply 
of breakfast staples on hand. (See Table 10-1 for a handy list.) Then when the 
oven suddenly stops working, your carefully prepared recipe doesn’t turn 
out as expected, or you find yourself with a guest who can’t eat anything 
you’ve prepared, you’ll be ready and able to use your creativity to whip up 
something on the spot.

Staying quality-conscious
If you’ve been wondering whether you have to bake everything from scratch, 
don’t worry — most innkeepers don’t. What you do need to keep in mind is 
the importance of offering quality, delicious, fresh food that you can serve to 
your guests with pride. Certain store-bought items are delicious and are great 
shortcuts when you scrutinize your choices. As long as the items you offer 
taste fresh, your guests will be happy. Some of your baked goods can come 
from a box, mix, food distributor, or local bakery, and your guests will never 
know the difference.
Nevertheless, guests aren’t expecting to be served warmed-up, pre-made 
food that you buy at a local wholesale store. True, many of these products 
are fantastic and can be used to supplement your own preparations, but B&B 
guests expect more than a complete breakfast warmed from a box or plastic 
container. What you serve for breakfast reflects on the quality of your bed & 
breakfast, so don’t miss the opportunity to impress your guests. By serving a 
quality breakfast, you also distinguish yourself from local chain hotels, many 
of which offer institutionalized bed & breakfast packages.
 
Guests will often ask you for your recipes. Don’t be embarrassed to tell them 
you used a mix, and be sure to tell them any special adaptations that you 
made to the recipe. One innkeeper jokes about some of her “secret recipes.” 
When guests ask her for one of these recipes, she tells them the recipe is so 
secret even she doesn’t know it!
Accommodating guests’ dietary 
needs and restrictions
Always ask your guests about allergies and dietary restrictions when you 
take their reservations. If something is important to guests, they should tell 
you at this time.

200
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Asking about preferences is another matter. You may find that your question 
about dietary preferences is interpreted by the guest as,“What do you want me 
to make special for you?” Some innkeepers serve a large enough variety of food 
items to accommodate even picky eaters. Other innkeepers feel strongly that 
the bed & breakfast experience means catering custom menus for their guests. 
Don’t judge yourself on how you decide to handle this. Simply be prepared 
with reasonable alternatives so that guests have the flexibility to request nec-
essary modifications and still have an enjoyable, satisfying breakfast.
 
Many food allergies are life threatening, and you must take them seriously. 
Guests with serious allergies are accustomed to following a strict diet to avoid 
foods that produce a severe allergic reaction. They will immediately tell you 
this when making their reservations if you ask them about allergies.
A quick Internet search makes it easy to find recipes for nearly any dietary 
request (for example, you might search for “gluten-free breakfast recipes”). 
Special dietary requests that you may be asked to accommodate include
 
✓ Vegetarian: Vegetarians don’t eat meat. Some eat fish, and most eat 
dairy products and eggs. If your staples include cereal, fruit, eggs, and 
yogurt, you should be able to accommodate these guests easily. This 
request is so common that many innkeepers don’t even consider it an 
issue. You’ll probably find that you can adjust most of your recipes 
easily by leaving out the meat, and even your non-vegetarian guests 
won’t miss it. Another option is to keep some meatless sausages in 
the freezer. You can pull them out at the last minute if you’d like to be 
extra-accommodating.
 
✓ Vegan: Vegans are strict vegetarians who eat no animal or dairy prod-
ucts at all, so this request is a bit more challenging. An excellent source 
for vegan recipes is www.vegweb.com.
 
✓ Gluten-free: Guests following a gluten-free diet usually do so for the 
treatment of a medical condition or a wheat allergy. Sometimes they’ll 
bring their own gluten-free bread, and they’ll usually tell you what they 
can eat so you can plan your menus accordingly.
 
✓ Popular diets: Low-carb, high-fiber, low-fat, and low-sodium diets are 
popular eating styles that many guests adhere to, either by choice or for 
health reasons (although many drop their resolve when on vacation). By 
having cereal, yogurt, and the other essential breakfast supplies listed in 
the earlier “Keeping basic ingredients on hand” section at your disposal, 
you should be able to accommodate these guests easily.
 
✓ Lactose-intolerant: Guests who are lactose intolerant need to avoid dairy 
products, including milk and cheese, but can usually tolerate soy milk.
 
✓ Kosher: Some guests seek out B&Bs that keep, prepare, and serve food 
by kosher standards. This is a niche market that you may decide to cater 
to. Sometimes guests who keep kosher at home are more flexible when 
traveling, but they still do not want meat and dairy served together.

201
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
Some inns, such as Coppertoppe Inn & Retreat Center in Hebron, New 
Hampshire (www.coppertoppe.com), pride themselves in accommodating 
not only guests’ allergies but also guests’ food preferences. Part of what 
their inn is known for is serving vegan, vegetarian, kosher pareve, and 
allergy-avoidant meals. When they know that a guest has a severe allergy, 
such as a peanut allergy, they advise their other guests not to bring these 
foods in to protect the guest with the allergy. Guests choose the inn just 
because of this. When guests who have allergies find a place where they 
can eat safely and enjoy their meals, they are very loyal and supportive and 
are a frequent source of referrals.
Preparing ahead: Mise en place
Part of your job as an innkeeper is to make everything appear effortless so 
that guests can relax and enjoy their getaways. Breakfast is a highlight of 
many guests’ B&B stays, but they won’t enjoy it as much — even if it’s abso-
lutely delicious — if you appear frazzled and they feel you’re being put out. 
So here’s the secret: Prepare ahead. Being organized also allows you time to 
interact with your guests before and after the meal and help them plan out 
their day. (See Chapter 12 for important communication skills and tips on 
interacting with guests.)
You can prepare ahead in a variety of ways, including
 
✓ Freezing: Your freezer is a fabulous appliance that you won’t be able to 
live without, so make sure it’s big enough.
Extra special breakfast touches
Here are some menu-planning ideas that can 
make your guests’ stays special:
 ✓ Plan seasonal menus. Lighter menu options 
are appreciated in the summer months, 
whereas heartier fare is common during 
the cold-weather seasons.
 ✓ Record what you serve during your guests’ 
visits, and make different specialties when 
those guests make a return visit (unless 
they rave about the dish — then see the 
next bullet).
 ✓ Make a note of each guest’s favorite menus 
and delight them by serving them on a 
return visit.
 ✓ Rotate between sweet and savory menus 
during a guest’s stay.
 ✓ Accommodate guests’ dietary restrictions 
and preferences, such as low-carb, vegan, 
and so forth. (See more on special request 
menus later in this chapter.)

202
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
• Bake ahead and freeze breads, muffins, and cookies, which can be 
thawed by leaving them out overnight and then heated if necessary 
before serving.
 
• Freeze batter for quick preparation of cookies and muffins.
 
• Make extra servings of sauces and then freeze them in individual 
portions that can be thawed as needed.
 
• Separate and freeze individual portions of cheese and sausage.
 
• Keep your freezer stocked with items to accommodate guests’ 
dietary needs, such as vegetarian meats.
 
✓ Anticipating: Be ready for last-minute menu substitutions by keeping 
essential staples on hand. See Table 10-1 for ingredients you should 
always have available.
 
✓ Organizing: Have everything ready and laid out the night before. This 
strategy not only limits the amount of noise you make preparing break-
fast in the morning, but also frees you up to handle any guest needs that 
may require your attention. Breakfast time is show time, and the show 
must go on. Before you turn in for the night,
 
• Set out everything you’ll need to prepare breakfast in the 
morning — paring knives, pans, ingredients, and equipment.
 
• Set up coffee and beverages for early risers.
 
• Set the table, including serving pieces.
 
Experiment with freezing ingredients, dishes, and individual portions of vari-
ous foods. Don’t test these techniques on your guests. Instead, play around 
with freezing different items to find out what freezes well and which dishes 
you can prepare ahead. Don’t forget to mark, date, and rotate items in your 
freezer for freshness.
Creating signature breakfast dishes
A breakfast specialty can be a valuable marketing tool. Guests will often 
remember your specialty, and it can become part of the brand image that 
comes to mind when guests think of your inn. You can designate something 
as a signature dish because
 
✓ It’s a particular favorite of yours and/or your guests
 
✓ It’s made from ingredients that your area is known for
 
✓ The recipe has some significance to the inn itself

203
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
If you create a signature dish, make sure you publicize it on your Web site 
and in your marketing material.
 
Create a section on your Web site to publish many of your favorite recipes. A 
popular way for people to find recipes is by searching for them online. When 
you publish yours on your Web site, guests looking for recipes may find them 
and get to know your inn. Make your recipes easily downloadable in a format 
such as a PDF file and, of course, make sure the print version includes your 
inn name and Web address.
 
You can also make recipe cards for your most-requested recipes. Recipe cards 
are a great memento for guests and a guarantee that they’ll remember your 
inn when making the recipe at home (again, be sure to include your inn’s 
name and Web site on your recipe cards). Recipe software programs such as 
Accuchef (www.accuchef.com) make creating recipe cards a cinch.
Preparing Some Guest Favorites
As an innkeeper, you should maintain a file of favorite “go-to recipes” that 
you’re comfortable making. You can assemble them into formal menus or 
mix and match them depending on your mood, what’s in season, ingredients 
that you have on hand, and what you think your guests will like. Be on the 
lookout for recipes that make a great presentation, yet are simple to prepare. 
If they can be assembled ahead of time, that’s a big added bonus. To get you 
started, I’ve included favorite sweet, savory, and vegetarian menus and their 
recipes in this section.
 
When you need inspiration, other innkeepers are the best place to find it. Ask 
them about their favorite recipes or cookbooks that they use (see Chapter 1 
for help in finding other innkeepers to talk to). You can find numerous inn 
cookbooks at a bookstore, at the library, and online. You can also check out 
some of the popular online directories where innkeepers share their recipes 
with other innkeepers and the public (www.bbonline.com, www.bnb
finder.com, www.iloveinns.com, www.lanierbb.com and www.bed
andbreakfast.com all have extensive recipe sections).

T Baked Pears
For this recipe, everything including the knife, pan, and nonperishable ingredients can 
be set out the night before, for quick preparation in the morning. This fragrant recipe 
fills the house with a wonderful aroma. Your guests will be drawn to the breakfast area 
by the enticing smell of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves as the pears bake in the oven.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Baking time: About 30 minutes
Yield: 5 servings
 
✓ Fruit course: Baked Pears with vanilla yogurt
 
✓ Main course: Baked Apple French Toast served with locally made maple 
syrup and sausage
 
✓ Baked goods: Banana Walnut Bread served with locally made jams
 
✓ Beverages: Coffee (caffeinated and decaffeinated), a selection of teas 
presented in a tea chest, orange juice, cranberry juice, ice water
What I like about this menu is:
 
✓ Use of local items: Journey Inn Bed & Breakfast always serves locally 
made maple syrup and jams that they find at local farmers’ markets and 
from local produce vendors.
 
✓ Vegetarian adaptability: This menu becomes a vegetarian meal if you 
leave off the sausage or serve a vegetarian sausage.
 
✓ Easy advance preparation: All three recipes can be prepared ahead of 
time, which makes for quick assembly in the morning.
5 ripe Bartlett pears
1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/2 to 3/4 cup orange juice

T Baked Apple French Toast
You can prepare this Baked Apple French Toast the night before so it only needs to be 
popped into the oven the next morning. You can bake the pears and French toast at the 
same temperature in the oven, and the aroma will guarantee hungry guests arrive at the 
table!
Preparation time: Approximately 20 minutes
Baking time: 40 to 45 minutes
Yield: 7–9 servings
2 to 3 tart apples (Granny Smith)
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1 loaf French bread, sliced into
20 to 24 3/4-inch slices
5 eggs
Several dashes of nutmeg
11/2 cups milk (or half-and-half)
1 tablespoon vanilla
 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
 2 Peel, core, quarter, and then slice apples.
 3 Combine sugar, butter, and corn syrup in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until 
syrupy. Stir to incorporate the ingredients.
 4 Pour into a 9-x-13-inch baking dish. Place apple slices over syrup mixture; then place 
bread on top of apple slices. Whisk together remaining ingredients and pour over bread.
 5 Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes.
Go-with: Serve with a side of sausage. I recommend precooked patties — they’re real time-
savers because they only need heating on top of the stove.

T Banana Walnut Bread
This was one of the first recipes Journey Inn Bed & Breakfast made for guests and 
throughout the years it has remained a guest favorite. The recipe can be prepared in 
batches, up to 4 weeks ahead of time, and pulled out of the freezer as needed. Allow the 
well-wrapped bread to defrost overnight on the counter. Simply warm before serving in 
a warm oven (approximately 275 degrees Fahrenheit) for 10 to 15 minutes.
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Baking time: About 11/4 hours
Yield: Approximately 24 servings (12 per loaf pan), depending on the thickness of the slices 
11/4 cups sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
11/2 cups mashed ripe bananas(3 to 4 medium)
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
21/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
 1 Move oven rack to low position so that tops of pans will be in center of oven. Preheat 
oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease bottom only of two 9-x-5-x-3-inch loaf pans.
 2 Using an electric mixer, mix sugar and butter in a large mixer bowl. With mixer running, 
stir in eggs until well blended. Add bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla. Using mixer, beat 
until smooth.
 3 Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt, using electric mixer on low speed, just until flour is moist-
ened. Stir in walnuts using mixer on low speed or stirring by hand. Pour batter into pans.
 4 Bake in preheated oven about 11/4 hours, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out 
clean. Rotate pans after 30 minutes and test after 1 hour.

Sample savory menu with recipes
This menu and the accompanying recipes are courtesy of the Inn at 
Riverbend in Pearisburg, Virginia (www.innatriverbend.com). The menu 
includes:
 
✓ Fruit course: Honeydew Melon with Prosciutto
 
✓ Main course: Ham & Cheese Strudel
 
✓ Baked goods: Cranberry Scones

207
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
✓ Beverages: Coffee (caffeinated and decaffeinated), a selection of teas, 
choice of two juices (orange and either pressed apple, V8, white cran-
berry, white grape, or pomegranate cranberry), ice water
What I like about this menu is:
 
✓ The choices are simple, yet elegant. The honeydew with prosciutto, 
mesclun greens with balsamic glaze, and sliced plum tomatoes require 
very little preparation yet are fresh and delicious items.
 
✓ The menu can easily be adapted to a vegetarian menu by eliminating 
the prosciutto on the melon and substituting another vegetable for the 
ham in the strudel.
 
✓ The scones can be prepared ahead of time and frozen. This is a great 
item to have in the freezer because you can pull out and bake exactly as 
many as you need at the last minute.
 
✓ The prep (chopping) for the strudel can be done the night before and 
the strudel can quickly be assembled and baked in the morning.
 
✓ Nothing ever goes to waste. For example, if you have melon left over 
from the melon and prosciutto recipe, you can cube the melon and 
use it in a fruit cup or use thin slices as a plate garnish the next morn-
ing. Leftover prosciutto can be chopped and added to scrambled eggs, 
omelets, or quiches.
Honeydew melon

 2 Wrap 1 piece of prosciutto around 2 melon slices.
Tip: Since melons are rarely ripe and ready to eat when purchased at the grocers, buy the 
melon several days ahead and allow it to ripen on the counter.

Ham and Cheese Strudel
This strudel offers a nice variation from the usual savory breakfast with an easy 
preparation and an elegant presentation.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: About 25 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
2 Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets
1 pound ham, finely chopped
1 16-ounce package shredded
Mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
4 stalks celery, washed, trimmed of greens,
 and finely chopped
1 large tomato, diced
1 egg, beaten with a little water
 1 Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove pastry sheets from freezer and thaw 
for 20 minutes.
 2 Roll each pastry sheet into a rectangle, smoothing out the folds.
 3 Mix together ham, cheese, celery, and tomato, then divide into two portions.
 4 Spread one portion to within 1 inch of the long edges of one pastry sheet. Fold the long 
edges to overlap just 1/4 inch and then press the short ends together and seal with your 
fingers. Repeat with remaining portion and pastry sheet.
 5 Turn pastries over so the seam side is down. Brush with egg beaten with a little water.
 6 Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, approximately 25 minutes.
Go-with: Serve with a small handful of mesclun greens, a thin slice of an orange tomato 
and a red tomato, and balsamic glaze drizzled over the top of the greens and tomato. The 
glaze can be found in specialty gourmet stores or by searching for “balsamic glaze” via the 
Internet to order online. Amounts for the greens, tomato, and glaze depend on the number 
of guests that you are serving.

T Cranberry Scones
Scones originated from a Scottish quick bread that is said to have taken its name from 
the Stone of Destiny, which supposedly is the place where Scottish kings were once 
crowned.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: About 15 minutes
Yield: 16 scones
2 cups all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons sugar plus
1 tablespoon for topping
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/2 cup halved, fresh cranberries,
drained on paper towels 
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons chilled, unsalted
butter, cut into pieces
2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon
half-and-half
 1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
 2 In a bowl, whisk together flour, 5 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in 
butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir 
in half-and-half until just moistened. Gently fold in cranberries.
 3 On a lightly floured surface, knead dough gently, 5 to 10 times. Divide the dough in half 
and pat into two 1/2-inch-thick rounds.
 4 Cut each round into 8 wedges. Place wedges on a baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Brush 
tops with remaining tablespoon half-and-half; then sprinkle with remaining tablespoon 
sugar.
 5 Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.
Tip: Fresh cranberries can be halved, drained, and frozen ahead of time.
Tip: Because fresh cranberries are seasonal, using dried cranberries is a wonderful substi-
tute year-round.
Tip: Make and freeze the wedges ahead of time, and then pull just the amount you need 
from the freezer in the morning. Bake per the directions above.

Sample vegetarian menu with recipes
The following menu and accompanying recipes are courtesy of the 
Birchwood Inn in Lenox, Massachusetts (www.birchwood-inn.com). The 
menu includes
 
✓ Fruit course: Pear Cranapple Crumble
 
✓ Main course: Mediterranean Frittata
 
✓ Baked goods: Aunt Norma’s Sour Cream Coffee Cake
 
✓ Beverages: Piping hot specially blended coffee, selection of teas, freshly 
squeezed orange juice
What I like about this menu is:
 
✓ Do ahead prep:
 
• On a rainy day or while waiting for the plumber, you can make up a 
double, triple, or even quadruple batch of the topping for the Pear 
Cranapple Crumble and freeze it in a large zip-top bag.
 
• Vegetables for the Mediterranean Frittata can be prepared the day 
ahead.
 
• The coffeecake can be made a day ahead and wrapped well. It also 
freezes nicely.
 
✓ Seasonal versatility: The Pear Cranapple Crumble is an autumn dish 
that can easily become a summer dish by substituting peaches, plums, 
nectarines, and blueberries for the apples and pears.
 
T Pear Cranapple Crumble
This recipe originated in the Northwest Territories in Canada and was passed on to the 
innkeeper by a teacher both of her sons had. Over the years she has continued to make 
little changes to improve upon the original recipe, making it one of her guests’ favorites.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: 1 hour
Yield: 12 servings

 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 1 Combine the brown sugar, flour, and butter in a food processor with the chopping 
blade and pulse several times; then place this mixture in a bowl. Add the oats and mix 
well with a spoon. Set aside.
 2 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a large (10-cup) baking dish.
 3 Cut the apples and pears into 1/4-inch-thick slices, leaving the peel on. Combine the 
apples and pears with the cranberries in a large bowl.
 4 Add the lemon juice and honey. Toss. Spoon the fruit mixture into the greased baking 
dish. Spoon the crumbled topping on the fruit. Grate fresh nutmeg on top.
 5 Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
Tip: In the fall, buy twice as many bags of cranberries as you need — one to use and one to 
freeze.
Tip: You can transfer the topping mixture to a zip-top bag and store it in the freezer for up 
to a month.

T Mediterranean Frittata
Any innkeeper, new or old, needs lots of kitchen tools and gadgets. They make life a lot 
easier and often add fun to cooking. They also give you greater flexibility to add new 
items to your repertoire. Frittata pans (available at Williams-Sonoma) are among inn-
keepers’ favorites. Two sizes are available: a large size to serve 6 and a medium size to 
serve 4. Each set has two pans: a deeper pan for starting the frittata and a shallower 
pan for flipping and finishing the dish. Although you can make the frittata with one 
frying pan, flipping part way through cooking, the frittata pans are a great investment 
that pay dividends in rave reviews!
Preparation time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: 6-7

212
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 1 Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet, and sauté the leek for about 3 minutes 
over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini to the leeks and continue cooking for another 
2 to 3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the vegetables. Crunchy is preferable to soft.
 2 Spoon the leek and zucchini into a bowl. Add the artichokes. Cut the roasted red pep-
pers in strips and place in a separate small bowl. If you are preparing the vegetables the 
night before serving, cover the two bowls and refrigerate.
 3 Lightly beat the eggs in a medium-large bowl. Add the cream, salt, and freshly grated 
pepper. Beat until well mixed. Add the cheese. Mix the leeks, zucchini, artichokes, 
roasted red pepper, and olives together. Measure 2 cups of the vegetables and add to 
the frittata. Add 1/4 cup of the parsley or basil to the egg mixture. Stir to blend.
 4 Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in the deeper frittata pan over medium to medium-high 
heat. Add the frittata mixture and spread evenly. Cook the frittata, frequently pushing 
the edges with a wooden spoon to allow the uncooked mixture to flow to the edges, as 
you would an omelet.
 5 Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the shallower pan. When the mixture is fairly 
well set but wet on the top (approximately 10 minutes), take the second pan and lock 
it on top of the first. Leave the two pans locked together for approximately 3 minutes. 
Holding the two pans together carefully, remove the pans from the heat. Flip the frittata 
so that it is now in the shallower pan (do this over the sink, in case of leakage). Return 
the pans to the heat and remove the first pan. Continue to cook until the center is 
fairly dry.
 6 Remove from heat and let sit for a few minutes. Slice into 6 pieces. Toss the remaining 
parsley onto each plate and plate the frittata.
Go-with: Accompany the frittata with oven-roasted rosemary potatoes, halved cherry 
tomatoes dipped in parsley, cherry tomato crisp, or grilled vegetables.
Tip: You can prepare the vegetables a day ahead and refrigerate them overnight.

T Aunt Norma’s Sour 
 
Cream Coffeecake
Four generations of the innkeeper’s family have enjoyed this moist and “cinnamon-y” 
coffeecake. Both the recipe and Aunt Norma are family treasures, and the recipe is a 
favorite of guests at the Birchwood Inn.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: 30 to 55 minutes, depending on pan used
Yield: 18-24 guests (although 12 guests have been known to devour it, leaving nary 
a crumb)
17/8 cups (2 cups minus one
tablespoon) all-purpose flour
11/2 teaspoons baking powder
11/8 teaspoons baking soda
Pinch of salt
3/4 pound butter, softened
11/2 cups sugar
3 eggs
11/2 teaspoons vanilla
11/8 cups (1 cup plus
1 tablespoon) sour cream
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup brown sugar
11/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/8 cup powdered sugar
 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and flour a 9-x-13-inch pan or a silicone 
Bundt pan. (The silicone Bundt pan yields prettier results than the 9-x-13-inch pan, but 
either one will suffice. Don’t use a regular Bundt pan, because the topping will settle to 
the bottom and stick to the pan.)
 2 Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
 3 In the bowl of an electric mixer, mix the butter and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla, and 
mix thoroughly.
 4 Add the dry ingredients and the sour cream to the mixture in Step 3 alternately, begin-
ning and ending with the dry ingredients and mixing on medium speed. Pour the batter 
into the greased and floured pan.
 5 Stir together the walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon to make streusel topping. 
Sprinkle the topping on top of the batter; then swirl the topping through the batter with 
a knife. If you are using a Bundt pan, swirl the topping very shallowly or it can sink to 
the bottom, making it difficult to remove the cake intact.
 6 Bake in preheated oven for approximately 30 to 35 minutes if using a 9-x-13-inch pan (50 
to 55 minutes if using a Bundt pan) or until cake tester comes out clean. Cool; invert on 
serving plate. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
Moving beyond Breakfast
In the beginning, you may want to be everything to every guest and to offer 
every service imaginable. In general, I caution and encourage you to stick 
with what you are — a bed & breakfast — and do this well.
Wait until you’re established before taking on the extra work and responsi-
bility of serving additional meals. If you’re planning to serve lunch and dinner 
on a regular basis from the beginning, I encourage you to reevaluate your 
business plan and determine whether you’re really going to be running a 
country inn and restaurant, rather than a bed & breakfast. Running a country 
inn and restaurant should only be considered with the necessary staff, 
equipment, permits, and knowledge, and then you should be clear to your 
guests that you are not a bed & breakfast.
My caution here does not, however, mean that you have to limit your culi-
nary hospitality to just breakfast. Offering complimentary snacks and bever-
ages can give your bed & breakfast a competitive edge.
Offering complimentary 
snacks and beverages
A hallmark of the bed & breakfast experience is hospitality. Extra touches 
such as complimentary snacks, treats, and beverages are distinguishing 
features that differentiate a bed & breakfast stay from a hotel stay and, 
sometimes, one inn from another.
Providing welcome refreshments
Guests don’t typically find fruit, cheese, cookies, or other welcome treats 
upon their arrival at a hotel, unless they’re repeat guests at a high-end 
establishment. Yet these complimentary amenities are common at many bed 
& breakfasts. You can do something as simple as offering a drink (cold or 
hot, depending on the season) with or without a cookie or other treat. 
Providing any type of refreshments is a sure way to start your guests’ visit 
off with a smile.
Offering complimentary snacks and drinks
Guests often cringe at the price of items in a typical hotel mini bar, so compli-
mentary snacks and drinks are highly appreciated amenities — even more 
so when they’re homemade. You may decide to make these items available 
24 hours a day, a setup which should be considered when designing your inn.

215
 Chapter 10: Making Breakfast a Memorable Meal
 
Don’t display an overabundance of anything that’s complimentary. Guests are 
unlikely to feel guilty taking more than they need from a full cabinet, yet 
they’re hesitant to take the last piece of anything. Groups tend to be more 
indulgent, so when hosting a group, use extra care regarding the amount of 
complimentary items you put out at any one time.
Creating a social environment
At many inns, the innkeepers create a social environment by offering after-
noon refreshments, afternoon tea, or after-dinner socials (check local liquor 
laws and your insurance company if you plan to serve alcohol). This is 
often a time for guests to mingle with each other and with you. Many guests 
consider these times a highlight of their stay — something they can’t get at a 
typical hotel.
You may find these hours of relaxed guest interaction to be your most enjoy-
able times as an innkeeper. This is a time to find out how your guests’ stays 
are going. You can also take the opportunity to enhance their stays with your 
first-hand knowledge of the area and your suggestions regarding activities 
and restaurants.
Serving lunch and dinner
Unexpected circumstances may land you in the kitchen whipping up a quick 
lunch or dinner, even though you don’t intend to serve them. I know of 
several inns where guests have been snowed in, and it has been difficult 
and dangerous for the guests to leave for meals. The innkeepers in these 
situations spontaneously put together a fabulous lunch or dinner for their 
guests and were surprised at how easy and enjoyable it was.
 
If preparing an impromptu lunch or dinner for guests is a possibility, be sure 
to have the necessary ingredients and staples on hand. These can be items in 
the freezer, nonperishable items such as pasta, or a combination of the two, 
such as pasta and frozen meatballs and sauce.
I’ve also heard stories of innkeepers whose guests smelled their dinner and 
the innkeepers subsequently invited them to join them — again, surprised 
by how easy it was to serve a few extra people. In some of these cases, this 
gave the innkeepers the idea to offer dinner packages that could be arranged 
in advance and added on as part of the guest’s stay. (See Chapter 17 for more 
information on adding services.)
 
Adding extra meals isn’t a decision you should make right away. Start slowly. 
Not only are extra meals a lot of work, but many other factors also play a role 
in determining whether it ultimately makes sense at your bed & breakfast. 
Following are the most important considerations:

216
Part III: Getting Ready for Guests 
 
✓ Are you zoned for these services? Be sure to check your local zoning 
ordinances and health department restrictions to see whether you’re 
able to offer additional meals and, if so, whether there are restrictions.
 
✓ Do you have adequate staff? If you’re already understaffed and can 
barely get everything done, let alone find any time for yourself, serving 
additional meals is a bad idea.
 
✓ Can you price the meals so that you make a profit? Factor in all the 
expenses — ingredients, staff (don’t forget the value of your time), 
permits, and so on — and make sure you can make a profit.
 
✓ Do guests want extra meals? If your area has many wonderful restau-
rants, your guests may be happy to have breakfast at your inn and 
enjoy the local flare by dining at different restaurants for lunch and 
dinner during their stay.

Chapter 11
Communicating with Potential 
Guests and Taking Reservations
In This Chapter
▶ Making a good impression on potential guests
▶ Taking reservations by phone and online
▶ Keeping a full house by managing last-minute vacancies
K
eeping your bed & breakfast full is the key to being a successful inn-
keeper. To help ensure that your bed & breakfast stays full, you need to 
communicate effectively with potential guests, take reservations efficiently, 
and handle cancellations with ease.
In this chapter I help you determine whether you want to take reservations 
by speaking with every guest, by handling everything through e-mail, by 
utilizing online, real-time booking capabilities, or some combination of all 
of these methods. No matter how guests make their reservations, many will 
also call you and/or visit your Web site. This phone call or Web visit is the 
beginning of their personal experience at your inn, so I give you tips on 
how to make a great first impression and turn inquiries into reservations. 
And because some reservations will inevitably fall through, I offer concrete 
suggestions for managing those last-minute cancellations.
Making a Good First Impression
You don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, so you want to 
be sure that your phone is always answered professionally and your Web 
site looks its best. Your chance to make a good impression starts the minute 
the guest picks up the phone to call you or sees your bed & breakfast on 
the Web.

220
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
To make the best impression, think of each phone call and each Web visit as 
another chance to sell yourself and your inn. Your guests don’t know you, 
and your bed & breakfast is just one of the many places they can choose to 
stay. In addition to having questions about your availability, your rates, and 
your rooms, potential guests are also checking you out, so make sure your 
phone is always answered in a professional manner and your Web site is easy 
to use with inviting text and appealing pictures. Making a good impression is 
imperative in turning the looker into a booker!
Your guests’ experiences are determined in large part by the personal ser-
vice you offer. Find out whether this is their first bed & breakfast experience 
and whether they’ve been to the area before, or ask why they are visiting 
and what their expectations are. Most reservation software will allow you 
to customize the guests’ reservation request to find out the reason they are 
visiting your area, and on the phone it’s easy to work these questions into 
the conversation without sounding nosy. Most guests will ask you upfront 
about your availability or your rates. Try responding with something like, 
“While I’m checking that for you, may I ask
 
✓ Whether this is your first visit to the area?
 
✓ Whether this will be your first stay at a B&B?
 
✓ What brings you to the area?
Many guests will have the same needs and requests, so keep a list handy 
of restaurants, spas, activities, and so forth that you can comfortably recom-
mend. This shows how knowledgeable and helpful you are, and makes the 
call go smoother.
 
The recommendations you make are a reflection on you, so before making 
them, either try the services yourself (speak with your accountant about 
tax-deductible business expenses) or only suggest services that many other 
guests have given good reviews of. Don’t forget to add these references 
to your Web site as a handy resource for guests, to develop partnerships 
with other local business, and to build content for optimizing your Web 
site (Chapter 15 has more information on getting optimal search engine 
placement).
 
Use guest questions as feedback. If many guests are asking the same question, 
this is a signal that you should include this information on your Web site. 
If you have numerous guests calling for something that isn’t applicable to 
your inn or area, ask them why they thought this was available. Probing to 
find out where a misunderstanding is originating enables you to make clarifi-
cations, especially if the confusion is coming from your Web site. Correcting 
the misleading information helps to avoid unhappy guests in the future.
Your inn will not be the right choice for all guests. For example, you may not 
be able to accommodate young children if your inn is full of antiques. When 
your inn is not a good match for the guest, be upfront and tell the guest so, 

221
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
and then make alternate suggestions. You may say something like, “I’m not 
sure that we’re able to meet your expectations. You may want to try the Main 
Street Inn or the Inn On the Way. May I give you their numbers?” You’ll spare 
yourself an unhappy guest and avoid a potential nasty online review, while 
making brownie points with your neighboring innkeepers, who may have a 
guest to refer your way in the future.
Representing Your B&B Over the Phone
You’re anxiously anticipating the first calls from guests, but have you 
thought about how you’re going to handle them? Many B&B guests, even 
those who book their reservations online, will want to speak directly with 
you. They may
 
✓ Have questions about the inn or the area
 
✓ Want to know which room is your favorite
 
✓ Want advice on the best place for dinner
 
✓ Want to “size up the innkeeper” by hearing your voice before they 
commit to staying with you
When a potential guest calls, you have to both gather and share quite a bit 
of information. Having a script or procedure to follow when you or your staff 
are taking reservations over the phone ensures that you get the necessary 
info the first time (you don’t want to annoy guests by asking a second time 
for information they’ve already given you).
 
Put together an actual script to use for phone calls, and then role-play some 
practice calls with your friends so you know what to say when the real calls 
come in. Have your staff practice calls with you so that they can build their 
confidence interacting with potential guests over the phone, and you can be 
sure they’re conveying the message and tone you want your guests to be 
greeted with. Check the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book to be sure you 
don’t skip essential reservation information.
Check out Chapter 8 for more info about representing your B&B online.
Answering the phone in a friendly, 
professional manner
Guests are calling a business, and your phone greeting should reflect this by 
including the name of your bed & breakfast. You don’t want a guest to have 
to ask: “Is this Mount Victoria?” Say something like, “Good Morning (after-
noon or evening); thank you for calling the award-winning Mount Victoria 

222
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Bed & Breakfast Inn. This is Lisa. How may I help you?” Use a strong, clear 
phone voice and imagine putting a smile in your voice. These inflections add 
to the first impression guests formulate about your inn.
Use enticing adjectives in your greeting, such as award-winning, historic, or 
majestic (if they’re true), to set your inn apart from the crowd. These simple 
words are extremely powerful, low-key selling tools that reiterate to potential 
guests that they’re calling a special inn.
 
Ask the potential guest for his name, jot it down, and use it often in the con-
versation. The bed & breakfast experience is about personalization, and 
there’s no better way to personalize it than by taking the time to remember 
and use someone’s name.
Part of answering professionally is answering early. Answer the phone before 
the third ring. Fair or not, subconsciously, guests make an assumption about 
your inn when the phone rings multiple times. Put yourself in the guest’s 
shoes and think about how you feel when you call a business and the phone 
rings and rings. If you’re busy and can’t get to the phone, make sure your 
answering machine or voice mail greets the guest with a professional mes-
sage before the third ring (see the later section, “Relying on answering 
machines or voice-mail systems” for details).
When you’re busy with another guest, serving breakfast, dealing with an 
overflowing toilet, or otherwise unable to devote your full attention to guests 
who call, let them know their calls are important and ask for permission to 
call them back. Try something like, “I’m helping another guest at the moment; 
may I call you back in 10 minutes so I can answer all your questions?” This 
lets guests know that when they stay with you, you’re going to take good care 
of them. Or consider, “I’m taking a batch of cookies out of the oven. May I call 
you back in 5 minutes?” The guest will probably imagine the wonderful smell 
of the cookies coming through the phone.
If you use these techniques, be sure your voice is pleasant and that you call 
guests within the time that you specify. Letting them know that they’re 
important encourages them to wait for you, rather than dial the next inn.
Probing for a potential guest’s 
needs and expectations
Engaging guests in conversations about why they’re visiting your area, what 
their expectations are, and what they’re looking for in an inn gives you the 
chance to help them plan a trip they can be excited about and, in the pro-
cess, secure a more definite reservation that’s less likely to result in a cancel-
lation. You’ll probably discover that when guests find out how much there is 

223
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
to see and do in your area, they’re likely to book a longer stay with you than 
they originally intended. A side benefit of interviewing your guests is ensur-
ing that they’ll be happy at your inn and you’ll be happy to have them.
Being a good listener makes you a good salesperson — one who’s able to 
match the right guests to your inn and your inn to your guests’ expectations. 
If a guest tells you that he and his wife are taking their first getaway together 
in ten years since they had children, you could ask whether they’d like 
suggestions for a romantic restaurant in town, or offer to schedule a couples 
massage for them at a nearby spa. The amount of personalization that 
you offer is up to you. Listen to the guests’ needs, and decide how you can 
most closely help them achieve the experience they’re looking for by 
choosing your inn. These are the extras that guests remember when they 
make referrals and write online reviews.
Sharing all the wonderful 
things your inn offers
Sell the experience before discussing price. When speaking to potential 
guests, you’re selling your inn, your area, and yourself. Be prepared to offer 
tips and suggestions for restaurants, attractions, and activities.
 
Tell guests at least three features of a room before telling them the price. If 
you tell guests that your rooms range from $129 to $295, few of them will opt 
for the $295 room unless you give them a reason. So try saying something like, 
“We have a Jacuzzi suite with a fireplace and private bath available; does that 
sound like what you’d be interested in?” Then you can tell them that room is 
$295. You can always offer your smaller rooms or rooms with fewer amenities 
if the guest’s response indicates that price is an issue.
Asking for the reservation
A good salesperson knows you’re much more likely to get an order when you 
ask for it. Taking the guest through the booking process is no different than 
walking a purchaser through any other sale. Without seeming presumptuous, 
you can offer to make the reservation for the guest by asking, “May I go 
ahead and confirm that for you?” The section “Taking Reservations,” later in 
this chapter, goes into this part of the process in more detail.
When guests are noncommittal, it’s okay to ask why they’re not ready to 
make a reservation. An easy way to accomplish this is to ask, “Is there any-
thing I didn’t mention that you’re looking for?” Asking this question enough 
times gives you good feedback about your reservation skills. If guests 
continually mention the same thing, then you know it’s something you should 

224
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
be including earlier in the conversation. However, their hesitancy may not 
have anything to do with what you have or haven’t told them — they may 
just be gathering information, sounding you out, or shopping around.
 
Don’t pressure a guest into a reservation. Guests who make a reservation 
because they don’t want to tell you no often end up cancelling those 
reservations. If a guest is hesitant, ask if he’d like to think about it and get 
back to you. If the guest wants you to hold the reservation, doing so for a 
brief period (never more than 24 hours) is usually fine, as long as you have 
a clear understanding with the guest that it is a temporary hold and not a 
reservation. For more on this topic, see the sidebar “Don’t contribute to a 
cancellation problem.”
Handling calls you can’t answer
Several tools are available to help you respond to guest inquiries when 
you’re busy with other guests, attending to emergencies, or otherwise 
engaged, or when you simply need some personal time to yourself. When you 
can’t answer the phone, consider the alternatives outlined in the following 
sections.
Relying on answering machines or voice-mail systems
Put your answering machine or voice mail to work. Appeal to your guests by 
considering the following when creating the message your guests will hear:
 
✓ Offer a short, pleasant, informative greeting. Include enticing adjectives 
(see the previous section “Answering the phone in a friendly, profes-
sional manner”).
 
✓ Customize your message according to whether the call is received 
during the day or after hours. During the day, you might say, “We’re 
assisting other guests, but we’re anxious to speak with you.” After 
hours, your message might say, “We’re sorry we can’t speak with you 
personally right now; please leave us a message, including a phone 
number where we can reach you during the day. You may also check 
our Web site at (and give your Web site address slowly)”. Some innkeep-
ers provide even greater personalization by changing their message 
when they’re running errands letting guests know when they’ll return 
calls, and others add seasonal customization such as updates on fall 
foliage and snowfall.
 
✓ Briefly describe highlights of your inn or area (for example, “We’re 
located across the street from the Vanderbilt Mansion and three 
miles north of the Culinary Institute” or “All of our rooms offer 
ocean views”).

225
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
 
✓ Invite callers to visit your Web site and slowly give your Web site 
address. While guests like the personalized service B&Bs offer, in 
today’s busy world they want to know quickly whether rooms are 
available, and most are eager to secure a reservation. Many guests 
want an immediate answer, and will call the next inn if they don’t reach 
you. Allowing guests to book reservations instantly online will satisfy 
many of these guests. (See the “Taking reservations online” section 
later in this chapter.) If you use reservation software for this purpose, 
include this in your message. You might say, “Please visit our Web site 
(and slowly give your Web site address) to check availability and make 
a confirmed reservation.”
 
✓ Last but not least, always encourage callers to leave you a message so 
you can call them back to handle their inquiries. (Remember they may 
have already seen your Web site and be calling with questions or want 
to confirm information). End the message with, “We look forward to 
speaking with you personally.”
Considering an answering service
Forwarding calls to an answering service such as Calling Inn (www.calling
inn.com) ensures that guests speak with a live person who can answer the 
most commonly asked questions about your inn. Some answering service 
companies can even take reservations or reservation requests for you if 
you want them to. This type of service is especially valuable if you work 
outside of the inn and are not available during normal business hours to 
answer and return phone calls. Unlike an answering machine or voice mail, 
a live person can give guests instant information. However, they can also 
give incorrect information. The only way to know if an answering service is 
right for you is to try them out, so ask about a trial period before signing a 
contract with them.
Taking Reservations
Taking reservations is as important to innkeepers as taking orders is to a 
waiter. It’s an essential component of your business. The reservation process 
usually represents your first contact with potential guests, so it’s an exciting 
part of your business as well. When it comes to taking reservations, you 
have a lot of choices as to how you go about it.
 
There is no right or wrong way to take reservations. You get to choose 
whether to take all reservations by phone, let guests request reservations 
by e-mail, allow guests to book rooms online in real-time, or use a combination 
of these techniques. The best reservation method is the one that makes you 
feel most comfortable and makes the most sense to you.

226
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
A lot of the information that you request from guests is determined by what 
reservation system you use and how the data is arranged in the software. 
(See Chapter 6 for information on choosing a reservation system, which may 
display only availability or be a complete Property Management System.) 
However, some essential information must be covered no matter how you 
take the reservation:
 
✓ Dates of arrival and departure
 
✓ Names of guests staying in the room
 
✓ Review of any policies pertaining to check-in and check-out times, 
smoking, children, pets, and so forth, as applicable
 
✓ Contact information for guests before arrival and cellphone numbers in 
case you need to reach guests on the date of arrival
 
✓ An agreed-upon arrival time, and your notification requirements should 
that time change
 
✓ Dietary restrictions (ask about allergies and dietary restrictions rather 
than preferences, or you’ll be a short-order cook)
 
✓ Review of your policies regarding deposits/prepayments and cancella-
tions/refunds
 
✓ The next step the guest should expect (for example, receipt of a confir-
mation letter or e-mail, depending on your system)
 
This is a good time to find out whether your guests will be celebrating 
a special occasion like an anniversary or birthday, affording you the chance 
to make their stay extra-special with a card or even a simple “Happy 
Anniversary.” A little personal attention goes a long way.
Taking reservations by phone
Even if you offer the most gorgeous and inviting Web site (see Chapter 8 for 
complete information on setting up a Web site for your B&B), guests will 
quickly lose interest in your B&B if they don’t receive a warm greeting when 
calling your inn. Each time you pick up the phone, think of it as going on an 
interview. Your interaction with guests while you’re making their reservation 
creates a personal connection, and starts your guests’ visits off on the right 
foot long before they arrive at your B&B.
As you collect the information you need from a guest (see the preceding 
section), write down when the reservation was taken. This detail can come 
in handy if any questions come up regarding your cancellation policy.

227
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
 
Ask what telephone number you may reach the guest at if you need to contact 
her concerning the reservation. You don’t want to spoil a surprise or let out a 
secret by calling someone other than the person who made the reservation 
with you. Additionally, you should have your guests’ cellphone numbers in 
case you need to reach them on the day they’re traveling to your inn.
You also need to know who will be staying at your inn, but you can’t always 
assume a couple are husband and wife. On the other hand, asking for the 
name of a guest’s partner may rub the guest the wrong way when he or she is 
a husband or wife. Consider simply asking for the names of the guests who 
will be staying in the room.
Taking reservations online
The B&B industry has been much slower than the airline and hotel industries 
to adopt confirmed, real-time, online reservations systems, primarily for two 
reasons:
 
✓ Innkeepers prefer to speak with their guests personally
 
✓ Innkeepers fear double bookings — reserving one room for two different 
groups — which can occur if you don’t have an organized system for 
keeping track of your reservations. Arriving guests don’t want to hear 
that there’s no room at the inn.
But regardless of these factors, guest demand is pushing the trend of real-
time, online reservations forward. How much information and control you 
give to online guests regarding your availability and making reservations are 
choices you need to make.
Don’t contribute to a cancellation problem
It’s easy to be so enthusiastic about your inn 
that a guest has a hard time telling you “no.” In 
these instances, guests may give you a credit 
card number to hold a reservation for several 
months into the future, even though they’re not 
really committed to coming. In your mind, once 
you take a reservation, the room is sold. Yet the 
guests may be thinking that they don’t have to 
cancel until 14 days prior to their planned 
arrival, so going ahead and making a reserva-
tion just gives them options.
Listen carefully to a guest’s questions and 
ascertain the level of commitment before taking 
the reservation. It will be a lot harder to fill 
that same room with only 14 days notice, and 
you’ll be doing the same work twice. Even 
though you should ask to help the guest make a 
reservation, you should never push for it.

228
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
In today’s information-rich world, guests are looking for immediate confirma-
tion. They don’t want to take the time to find out about an inn until they’re 
sure the inn has a room available that fits their travel schedule.
Most guests determine when they want to travel first and do research 
secondarily to determine where to stay. Rarely does this process work in 
reverse — with a guest first choosing an inn and then deciding when to 
travel based on the inn’s vacancies.
You have three main options when you’re using the Internet to aid you in 
taking reservations. The following sections give you details on each option.
 
You shouldn’t feel pressured to handle reservations in a manner you’re not 
comfortable with. Some innkeepers feel that if their reservation process 
requires them to speak with every guest personally, they lose reservations 
because many guests book with the first inn that has availability. Other inn-
keepers feel that by speaking with each guest prior to the reservation, they’re 
better able to ensure that the guest is right for the inn and the inn is right for 
the guest. Each system is explained in greater detail in the following sections. 
If you’re really unsure which system makes sense to start with, speak with 
other innkeepers who have inns similar to yours in terms of size, occupancy, 
and innkeeper involvement.
Showing availability only
When you show guests availability only, you display a calendar of when 
you have rooms available and when you’re booked. (Some calendars show 
availability by date only, whereas others display availability by room.) 
These calendars can be displayed on your Web site and on many other online 
adverting pages, such as directory listings (see Chapter 8 for information on 
online directories) and some association Web sites.
The calendar merely shows when rooms are available and when they’re 
booked. Guests can quickly scan the calendar for this information, but they 
can’t request or confirm a reservation until they contact you.
You should consider this option if you’re an innkeeper who wants to speak 
with your guests before confirming their reservations or if you don’t want 
the responsibility of having to update your computer system immediately 
upon taking a reservation. This also works well if you don’t want guests to 
see that a particular room is booked and bypass your inn without having the 
opportunity to sell them a different room. You also may use it to let guests 
know when you have no rooms available so you aren’t bothered with calls for 
rooms that are already booked. If you choose this type of system, make sure 
it clearly tells guests how to contact you to make a reservation.

229
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
Taking reservation requests
In addition to showing guests your availability (see the preceding section), 
either by date or by room, these systems let guests submit a reservation 
request by e-mail or through a form online. Requests are not confirmed 
reservations until you confirm them with the guest.
Innkeepers choose this option for a variety of reasons. The guest’s request 
starts the reservation process, yet it still gives the innkeeper the option to 
speak with the guest before the reservation is confirmed. You don’t need to 
worry if you’re unable to update your availability in real-time because the 
guest is only making a request, not a confirmed reservation. As a result, you 
can’t double-book a room, even if your system is not updated.
 
A word of caution about the reservation request system: You need to make 
it clear to guests that they are only making requests and not confirmed 
reservations. Software programs that cater to the B&B industry automatically 
send a guest who makes a reservation request an e-mail that acknowledges 
the request and tells the guest what to expect next, such as a call from you 
to confirm the reservation. These e-mails specifically state that this is not 
a confirmed reservation; however, you should follow up quickly because 
guests often don’t read these details and assume they have a confirmed 
reservation.
Confirming real-time reservations
This system allows guests to book online as soon as they find an inn they 
like, even if it’s in the middle of the night. Many innkeepers choose this 
format because they feel they would lose the reservation otherwise. Guests 
prefer this system because they know that once they’ve found an inn they 
like, they can make a reservation and receive a confirmation immediately 
without directly speaking with you.
Your real-time room inventory and availability is stored on your software 
vendor’s server if you use a Web-based system and on your computer if 
you use a desktop application (Chapter 6 explains the different systems). 
This feature allows you and the general public to view your inventory at the 
same time. It makes sense for innkeepers to have a high-speed Internet 
connection because although online reservation systems may work using a 
dial-up connection, the process is very slow.
When you receive a room request by phone, you must keep the caller on 
the phone while you put the reservation through the system to make certain 
a confirmation number is generated. No confirmation number means no 
reservation.

230
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
If you don’t put the reservation through while your guest is on the phone, 
you run the risk of an online guest booking the room before you do! Say, 
for instance, that you’re interrupted or distracted and you don’t book the 
room requested by a caller right away. In the meantime, a guest viewing 
your inventory online makes a reservation for the same room and date you 
promised to your caller. The online guest has already received the confirma-
tion number, so the room belongs to her, not the person who contacted you 
by phone earlier in the day. This may seem unfair, but real-time reservations 
systems operate strictly on a first-booked, first-served basis. The fact that 
you’re the owner of the inn does nothing to alter this.
You can have your real-time availability programmed so as not to allow 
same-day bookings. An online note will then display, telling the viewer to 
call the inn directly for same-day room availability. This prevents a double 
booking from occurring in the event that you have drop-ins (sometimes 
called drive-bys or walk-ins — people who drop by without reservations 
hoping you’ll have a vacancy for them on the spot). You won’t run the risk of 
other guests showing up later that night for the same room because they 
were booking it online while you were checking in the drop-ins.
After you are accepting confirmed, real-time reservations, you may opt to 
participate in the GDS (Global Distribution System) through most software 
providers. GDS is the system used by travel agents, and participating gets 
your property listed on such sites as Travelocity and Expedia. The price, 
however, is steep — you should expect to pay fees of up to 30 percent for 
each booking.
Avoiding Cancellations and 
Managing Vacancies
Busy innkeepers have a tendency to focus on their current guests. But 
managing last-minute vacancies, whether due to cancellations or lack of 
demand, is part of your revenue management plan. So no matter how busy 
you are, keep an eye on your upcoming reservation calendar.
Rooms are your inventory, and unsold inventory has a shelf life or expiration 
date. If you have five rooms and one of them is vacant, especially on a peak 
weekend, you’re forgoing 20 percent of your potential revenue.
You can take some examples and inspiration from the cruise ship and airline 
industries in thinking about how to handle your last-minute vacancies. Once 
a ship sets sail or a plane takes off, all chances of earning revenue on vacant 

231
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
cabins or seats are lost. Just like these industries, you may want to offer last-
minute packages and specials. Many of the top online directories (listed in 
Chapter 8) have last-minute getaway pages where you can promote your last-
minute specials. Discounts aren’t the only technique to fill vacancies. Keep a 
careful eye on your future reservation calendar and check out the sugges-
tions in the section, “Filling unsold rooms,” later in this chapter. Planning 
ahead and finding out how to fill your rooms is guaranteed to work better 
than crossing your fingers and hoping for a walk-in guest.
The best way to keep a full house is to avoid having to sell a room twice. Do 
everything you can to avoid a cancellation, leaving you with a last-minute 
vacancy. Keep in mind, though, that while cancellations are disappointing, 
they’re also inevitable, and they’re not personal.
Clarifying your cancellation policy
Having a good, clear cancellation policy is the best way to avoid cancella-
tions. (See Chapter 7 for help in setting your policies.) Making sure that 
guests understand your cancellation policy is your responsibility. Post the 
policy clearly on your Web site or anywhere else a guest can make a reserva-
tion, and include it in your confirmation letters and e-mails.
Be aware that guests, especially first time B&B goers, may be accustomed to 
hotels where they can cancel up until the day of arrival. You don’t double-
book your rooms expecting cancellations the way hotels do, so your cancella-
tion policy is different. Some innkeepers like to include wording such as
Due to our size and the personal attention we offer our guests, cancellations 
affect us greatly. Your deposit is your commitment to us that you are reserv-
ing this room and our commitment to you that your room will be waiting for 
you upon your arrival. Please be sure you have read and understand our 
cancellation policy.
 
If you take a guest’s credit card to guarantee a deposit, you may need to 
charge the card if the guest cancels at the last minute or doesn’t show. Check 
with the merchant bank that processes your credit cards to see whether you 
need to include any special wording or procedures in your policy to ensure 
you won’t come up against any problems in these situations. (See Chapter 7 
for information on accepting credit cards.)
While I recommend sticking to your policy in order to protect your revenue 
stream, if you want to be flexible because of personal circumstances or 
because you can easily rebook a room, that’s your decision to make. In some 
cases, bending the rules a little can make you a winner in the end.

232
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Filling unsold rooms
When you find yourself with available rooms, especially during your peak 
season and on weekends, you need to take a closer look at the prices of 
your rooms, your minimum stay requirements, and your marketing efforts. 
If your rooms are priced higher than the competition’s or if your guests 
don’t perceive them as a good value, you need to reevaluate — and possibly 
lower — your rates. (See Chapter 7 for info on setting rates.) Sometimes 
your pricing is fair, but your minimum stay requirement keeps guests from 
booking with you and causes them to choose the competition instead. 
Relaxing this requirement may help you book more rooms. However, you 
need to decide whether the trade-off of more rooms to turn over justifies 
the increased occupancy.
 
Most inns aren’t doing all they could to market their property to potential 
guests. The more often guests find your inn, the more likely you are to fill your 
rooms, so being found is more than half the battle. Once guests find an inn 
they like, they’re unlikely to spend a lot of time looking around to save $5. 
Spending time marketing your inn (see Chapters 8 and 15) always brings more 
guests your way.
No matter what you do to avoid cancellations and fill your rooms in advance, 
last-minute vacancies will occur, so here are several ideas to keep a steady 
flow of last-minute inquiries to offset your losses:
 
✓ Keep a waiting list. When guests call for rooms and you’re already 
booked, ask if they would like to be put on your waiting list. This leaves 
the guest with a good impression of your inn — your inn must be 
popular if it’s often booked and keeps a waiting list, plus you’re giving 
them personal consideration.
 
 In addition to putting customers on a waiting list, ask whether they’d 
like to be put on your mailing list to receive notices of special packages 
and upcoming events. The fact that you’re booked already tells guests 
that your inn is a great choice, so keep your name in front of them by 
sending them your newsletter.
 
✓ Offer a last-minute or off-peak special. When you see that you have 
upcoming availability during slow seasons or as a result of a last-minute 
cancellation, you can entice guests with last-minute packages (see 
Chapter 15 for help creating packages).
 
✓ Coordinate with other inns in the area. Get to know the other inn-
keepers in your area, and suggest referring guests amongst yourselves. 
Then when other inns in the area are full, they can refer guests to 
you to fill your vacancies without those guests having to find you on 
their own.

233
 Chapter 11: Communicating with Potential Guests and Taking Reservations
 
 Any recommendation that you make is a reflection on you, so only enter 
into this arrangement if the inn you refer guests to offers an experience 
that’s comparable to staying at your inn. Remember the guest may be a 
frequent visitor to your area, and if your referral doesn’t work out, that 
guest won’t stay at either inn in the future.
 
✓ Consider upgrading existing guests upon arrival. When guests arrive, 
give them a tour of the inn. If an unbooked room is an upgrade over 
the room they reserved, be sure to include it in the tour. Oftentimes, 
guests will ask to upgrade after seeing your better rooms.
 
  If guests don’t request an upgrade, you always have the option of 
earning some brownie points by upgrading them at no extra charge. 
Only you can be the judge of how often you want to do this. Doing so 
increases the likelihood of these guests becoming repeat customers 
and referring your B&B to others, filling future unsold rooms. On the 
downside, you don’t want return guests to come to expect upgrades. 
Keep the overall picture in mind and don’t upgrade the guest until 
check-in, or you’ll lose the opportunity to sell the higher-priced room 
to this guest at check-in or to a last-minute guest inquiry.
 
✓ Create an e-mail notification list. Invite previous guests to be on a 
special e-mail list that lets them know when you have a cancellation or 
last-minute vacancy and are offering a special discount.

Taking Care of Guests
In This Chapter
▶ Being an extraordinary host
▶ Handling problem guests
▶ Knowing what a guest wants before they ask
N
ow comes the exciting part — what being an innkeeper is all about . . . 
welcoming guests to your bed & breakfast! How you take care of your 
guests is integral to the personality of your inn.
In this chapter, you find out how to manage the check-in process to avoid 
misunderstandings and maximize your guests’ safety and comfort from the 
moment they arrive. I tell you how to make sure they enjoy their time at 
your bed & breakfast so much that they’ll start planning their next visit 
before they’ve even checked out! And for those rare occasions when you 
find yourself hosting problem guests, I give you some warnings about what 
to expect along with some tips on handling difficult people.
When the Guest Arrives
Your inn is more than just a beautiful setting. While the physical structure is 
important, what defines your bed & breakfast is the experience that your 
guests have when staying at your B&B. The arrival of each new guest and the 
return of repeat guests add to the dynamics of your inn and become a part of 
its evolving history. Your job is to create a welcoming environment and to 
facilitate camaraderie among your guests so that everyone’s getaway 
becomes intertwined with the energy and fun of staying at your B&B. Starting 
off on the right foot with a warm and informative welcome sets the stage.
 
Use the following information to create a checklist of guest check-in proce-
dures to help you keep the process running smoothly and signal to your 
guests that you are graciously in charge. Of course, you won’t carry the 
checklist around with you as you’re checking guests in, but having a set 
procedure is helpful not only to you, but also to anyone who may greet guests 

236
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
in your place — whether they be new employees, staff members, or interim 
innkeepers. When first starting out, it’s a good idea to practice check-ins on 
staff, friends, or family.
Setting the tone with a warm welcome
Your welcome sets the tone for your guests’ visits, behaviors, and anticipa-
tions. Guests can be turned off at the most spectacular inn if they feel 
no warmth or hospitality when they arrive. There’s no one secret tip to 
make your guests feel welcome; rather, it’s the little things that add up to 
differentiate a stay at your inn from other inns and hotels. For starters, be 
sure to perform the following tasks before your guests even arrive:
 
✓ Confirm curb appeal. The outside of your bed & breakfast should be as 
welcoming as the inside. Guests form an immediate opinion of your inn 
the minute they arrive, so landscaping, ease of parking, and the exterior 
of your inn must be maintained. Don’t forget to include well-spaced 
lighting for guests arriving after dark.
 
✓ Check your entryway. Try to see your inn through your guests’ eyes as 
they step inside. Is the front door clean and well painted? Is the entry-
way clean, uncluttered, and welcoming? Be sure it makes a good, strong 
first impression.
 
✓ Remind yourself of pertinent reservation details. Review your guests’ 
expected arrival times and familiarize yourself with their names. Also 
note special dietary requests or special celebrations and verify the 
details of any packages that they have reserved. Your guests will feel 
warmly welcomed when greeted by name, and your exceptional hospi-
tality will be evident when their dietary restrictions are accommodated 
without question and the details of their packages such as massage 
appointments, flowers, chocolates, and so on are in place.
Guests with a positive first impression of your bed & breakfast are more 
likely to overlook anything that isn’t quite perfect than guests who start out 
on the wrong foot — the latter are the ones most likely to remember and 
complain. So to make that all-important first impression a mark in your favor, 
here are some thoughts from experienced innkeepers on greeting guests:
 
✓ Answer the door. (Many B&B guests ring the doorbell.) Think about 
how you would feel arriving at a B&B with no one to greet you and not 
knowing where you should go or how to find the person in charge. 
Greet your guests with a warm and genuine greeting and big welcoming 
smile. When possible, open the door before they have a chance to ring 
the bell.

237
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
✓ Extend a warm greeting. Introduce yourself and welcome the guests 
to your inn (or welcome them back if they’re returning guests). Break 
the ice by asking how their trip was or whether this is their first visit 
to the area. If they’re celebrating a special occasion, be sure to mention 
it. Memorize and use their first names to make them feel welcome.
 
 Your smile, the tone of your voice, your body language, your appear-
ance, and your immediate availability affect your guests’ initial feelings 
about your inn. Imagine the difference between being greeted by an 
innkeeper with a mop in hand and cleaning clothes on and being greeted 
by a neatly dressed innkeeper with a huge smile welcoming you through 
a wide open door.
 
✓ Ask guests where they are parked and/or give them parking 
instructions.
 
✓ Offer to help them carry in their luggage.
Checking guests in
When guests arrive, they’re likely to be weary from traveling and eager to 
get to their room. Having an organized check-in procedure speeds the 
process along.
Don’t keep guests waiting to check in. If guests are backed up, seat them in 
the common room, offer refreshments, and check them in by turns.
Be sure to take the following steps as you check in each guest:
 
1. Verify/record each guest’s full name, home address, phone number, 
vehicle description, and license plate number on the guests’ reserva-
tion card/folio (see Step 5 for more information).
 
2. Verify the room selected and the rate of the room plus occupancy tax 
(mention any discounts, upgrades, or offers).
 
3. Confirm the check-out date and time.
 
4. Swipe a credit card or collect the outstanding balance.
 
 As a new innkeeper, you may feel uncomfortable collecting payment 
during the welcome process, but getting payment upfront avoids the 
possibility of misconceptions about how long guests plan to stay, 
misunderstandings about the price of the room, guests slipping away 
without paying, or guests feeling rushed if they need to check out early 
while you’re preparing breakfast for other guests. Also, it’s rather 
anti-climactic to be enjoying the spirit of friendship after hosting guests, 
and then giving hugs and saying your good-byes only to butt in with 
“Oh, by the way, you need to pay $435.23 before you leave.”

238
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
5. Have guests sign their reservation card/folio.
 
 This card/folio is a record of the guests’ stay and their notification of 
your policies. It may be a template from your property management 
system, a custom form, or a combination of both. It usually includes the 
guests’ name(s), address, phone, e-mail, room, rate, dates of stay, credit 
card information, vehicle description, driver’s license number, policies 
such as smoking and pets, conditions for damage, cleaning or other 
charges, breakfast time, and check-out time.
 
6.  Ask guests if they need help with recommendations or reservations 
during their stay.
 
 What sets your inn apart from other B&Bs and the bed & breakfast 
experience apart from a hotel stay is you. Proactively offering concierge 
services is guaranteed to enhance your guests’ experience.
 
7. Give the guests a receipt, a copy of the card/folio they signed, and all 
necessary keys and access codes (to the front door, their room, and 
so on).
 
Practice the flow of checking guests in. Decide whether you want to check 
guests in, collect payment, and then give guests a brief tour of the inn, or 
whether you want to show guests to their rooms first and let them settle in 
for a few minutes before officially checking them in. Most innkeepers prefer 
the former.
Occasionally mistakes are made and you or a staff member will book two 
guests in the same room. It doesn’t matter how it happened (of course 
you’ll want to figure it out later so it doesn’t happen again); your immediate 
concern is to take care of the guest. If you don’t have another room to offer, 
find the guest a room at another inn for the period of the double booking. 
Make sure it’s a room of equal or greater value than the room they had 
reserved with you, and pay the difference regardless of the cost (or refund 
any balance if the price is lower). Apologize profusely and try to get the 
guest back to your inn as soon as possible. Then do something extra for 
them, such as leaving flowers or wine in the room.
Getting guests settled and taking a tour
Hotels are easy to navigate, but your guests don’t know the lay of the land at 
your inn, so give guests a welcome tour of your inn, including all common 
areas and outdoor spaces (weather permitting), before showing them to their 
rooms. Here are some things you don’t want to forget on the welcome tour of 
your inn:
 
✓ Show guests the common areas. Be sure to invite your guests to use 
these spaces. Let them know that they’re often used by other guests so 
they feel comfortable using them. Point out any related amenities and 
information, such as:

239
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
• Complimentary snacks and beverages like early-morning coffee, 
afternoon tea, or after-dinner drinks (check the liquor laws in your 
area if you serve alcohol)
 
• Board games, cards, DVDs, a lending library, and newspapers
 
• Frequently requested maps, brochures, and other area informa-
tion, such as a listing of local churches
 
• A book with local restaurant menus
 
✓ Tour outdoor areas. Don’t forget to show guests patios, outdoor hot 
tubs, gardens, and so on. Be sure to tell guests where to get towels 
for the hot tub and where to find umbrellas and cushions if you don’t 
automatically set them up.
 
✓ Remind guests of your policies. A welcome tour provides the perfect 
opportunity to reinforce and clarify policies regarding breakfast times, 
smoking, children, and pets. Clearly communicating your policies to 
guests as part of their orientation helps to underscore your expectations 
and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings.
 
 You don’t want to beat guests over the head with rules when they’re 
trying to get comfortable, but they do need to know the policies and 
guidelines. So be sure to establish boundaries ahead of time by provid-
ing a copy of your policies when you confirm your guests’ reservations, 
posting your policies clearly on your Web site, and giving guests a copy 
of their reservation card/folio with your major policies listed on it when 
they check in. If you want to post one or two policies in the rooms, do 
so with informational notes tastefully displayed. For example, create 
them in calligraphy (computers usually have many fancy fonts) and 
post them in a small, attractive frame. You might also consider creating 
a Guest Book for each room that includes important information about 
your inn, your policies, amenities, and area activities. This information 
is handy for guests to refer to; however, because many don’t read it, you 
shouldn’t rely on it to communicate your policies.
 
✓ Point out fire escapes and emergency exits. Tell guests where this 
information is posted in their rooms (usually on the back of the door) 
and show them fire escapes and emergency exits during the tour.
 
✓ Provide pertinent info about amenities and appliances. Briefly explain 
how to use amenities and appliances such as wireless Internet, the TV 
remote, the heating or air conditioning system, the telephone, the hot 
tub, and the fireplace. But also leave behind clear, written instructions 
that guests who are distracted by the details can reference later.
 
 If your inn practices a linen reuse program, now is a good time to 
explain to guests how to let you know when they want their linens and 
towels changed. (Refer to Chapter 13 for information on linen reuse 
programs.)
 
✓ Let guests know how to reach you. Guests need to know how to reach 
you in the event of an emergency and how to ask you questions about 
the inn and the area. If you live on-site, remind them of this.

240
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
Guests should always know how to reach you, whether you’re running errands 
or out for the evening. When you’re away from the inn leave a brief note where 
guests can see it letting them know how to reach you and/or when you plan 
to return (the innkeeper’s door and the inn’s front desk are ideal spots for 
communicating with current guests, and the inn’s front door is a good spot to 
leave notes for new arrivals or drop-ins).
During the first few hours after guests have arrived, you should expect to be 
asked questions you’ve already covered. Be patient and gracious, and use 
questions as feedback. If you’re getting the same questions over and over, it’s 
a cue for you to analyze how you provide the information to guests and ask 
yourself whether you can make the information clearer.
 
Part of being a good innkeeper is to periodically ask guests how their room 
is and whether they’re finding everything okay. Asking these key questions 
within a few hours after guests have settled in helps to put them at ease, 
demonstrates that you’re genuinely concerned about their comfort, and gives 
you a chance to correct any deficiencies they may bring to your attention.
Accommodating early check-ins
Innkeepers commonly receive requests for early check-ins. “Early” means 
different things to different people. Sometimes guests arrive early and 
unannounced — in fact, don’t be surprised to have guests show up to check 
in while you’re still serving breakfast to your current guests — and an 
unrushed, gracious check-in can easily take up to 30 minutes.
As with most things in the B&B world, there are no absolutes. Deciding if and 
when you want to grant an exception is up to you. If your guests’ room is 
ready, you may decide that their request is easy enough to accommodate. 
Other times — even when the room is ready — you may decide that an early 
check-in just isn’t possible.
 
Your check-in policy should be as clear as all your other policies. But no 
matter how clearly you word it, some people simply won’t read it. They’re 
also unlikely to understand how much happens during the 3 to 4 hours you 
have between check-out and check-in (cleaning rooms and the rest of the 
inn, changing linens, doing laundry and yard work, baking, running errands, 
giving tours of the inn, taking reservations, and more). You need to protect 
this time in order to welcome your guests with your best foot forward.
Common check-out times are 11 a.m. and noon, and common check-in times 
are from 3 to 6 p.m. or 4 to 7 p.m. Once you’ve been open for several months, 
you’ll get to know when most guests want to check in and you can adjust 
your times accordingly. Just make sure you allow yourself enough time 
between check-out and check-in to clean the rooms to the standard that you 
set for your inn — without having to rush and feel frazzled.

241
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
Having someone else in the house also has a psychological and an emotional 
impact. If you’re between guests, you may need an hour to yourself to eat 
lunch or make some personal calls. This is okay. Taking time when you can 
makes you a better innkeeper in the long run.
 
Sometimes guests will tell you when they make their reservation that they’d 
like to check in early. Even if you want to accommodate them, you don’t 
know whether the previous guests will be checking out at the last minute and 
whether you’ll have time to turn over the room. In this case, you can suggest 
that they call you as they get close to the inn on their arrival day, and that 
you’ll let them know then whether or not their room is available.
 
Other guests may ask to drop their luggage off early. Sounds like a simple 
enough request on the surface, and for many it is, but beware: In some 
innkeepers’ experience, there’s no such thing as just dropping off luggage. 
Dropping off luggage often leads to using the restroom, and many B&Bs 
don’t have a public restroom. This means that guests need to be allowed into 
their rooms, which means their rooms need to be ready for them — and if 
that’s the case, they might as well check in. With or without a public restroom, 
dropping off luggage early may or may not be a courtesy you want to extend 
to your guests.
When you’re not ready for guests who arrive early, you have the following 
options:
 
✓ Answer the door and step outside to tell your guests that you’re 
sorry their room isn’t ready (whether it is or not). Remember that this 
impromptu greeting is an important first impression of your inn. Be 
hospitable, and suggest places for them to have lunch or an attraction 
they might want to see. Let them know you’re looking forward to 
welcoming them at 3 p.m. (or whatever your designated check-in time 
is) and that their room will be ready and waiting for them then. How 
firm you want to be is up to you and how much you need to get done.
 
✓ When you really need to get something done, you might not even 
answer the door — but don’t let your guests know you’re inside if you 
use this tactic. Any time you’re not able to answer the door or are 
running errands, leave a note for guests on the front door letting them 
know you’re away from the inn and that you’ll return by whatever your 
check-in time is.
Handling late arrivals
Your reservation procedure should include asking guests for their approxi-
mate arrival time, requesting that they contact you if they’re running late, 
and asking whether they have a cellphone by which they can be reached 
if necessary while they’re en route. (See Chapter 11 for complete details 

242
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
on taking reservations.) However, despite the fact that you agree upon a 
window of time during which your guests should arrive, the unexpected 
often happens, causing your guests to arrive later than planned.
Some of your guests will give you a courtesy call to let you know that they’re 
running late, but many first-time B&B goers (and others) won’t — perhaps 
they think you have a 24-hour check-in desk. Whatever the reason, you may 
have plans that prevent you from being at the inn. Just the fact that you need 
to get up early to prepare breakfast makes waiting for late-arriving guests 
very inconvenient. While some innkeepers choose to wait and greet every 
guest personally, no matter what the time, there is a viable alternative. You 
can institute a self-check-in plan for late arrivals that allows your guests to 
help themselves.
When guests tells you they plan to arrive after your normal check-in time or 
call to let you know they’re running late, you can tell them how to check 
themselves in. For guests who arrive late with no advance warning, you can 
leave a note at the front door explaining your self-check-in procedure. 
Alternatively, you can leave a note with a phone number to call you. Once 
you’ve identified them, you can give them the information for a self-check-in. 
Systems to enable self-check-in can take on many forms, including
 
✓ A combination key lock on the front door
 
✓ A lock box (ideally one that allows you to set the combination — for 
example, to the last digits of the guest’s phone number).
 
✓ A hidden key
 
✓ An electronic door lock and/or intercom system
 
✓ An unlocked door
 
✓ A key in an envelope
Naturally, the neighborhood in which your inn is located determines how 
secure you feel with any of the preceding self-check-in procedures.
To make the self-check-in procedure run smoothly, do the following:
 
✓ Leave a welcome note for the guests with information on the location 
of their room and when breakfast will be served. You should leave 
lights on throughout the inn and the grounds so they can easily find 
their room.
 
✓ Leave the lights on in the guests’ room and put a sign on their door with 
the room name, so there are no misunderstandings as to which room is 
reserved for them. Keep all other room doors closed — and preferably 
locked. You don’t want your guests looking around and choosing 
another room.

243
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
Send out an e-mail the week before your guests’ scheduled arrival, letting 
them know you’re looking forward to their visit and confirming their arrival 
time. Include a reminder to give you a call if their arrival time changes.
Interacting with Your Guests
Hosting personal friends and family members in your home is quite different 
from hosting guests who pay to stay at your bed & breakfast. Successful 
innkeepers know that taking care of guests is much more than offering a 
lovely room in a beautiful home and cooking wonderful food for guests to 
rave about. B&B guests choose bed & breakfasts over hotels because of 
the experience. You, the innkeeper and host, are a big part of the guests’ 
experience. Your attention to their needs, whether it’s offering additional 
amenities or respecting their desire for privacy, shapes their experience at 
your inn. Ultimately, your interaction with your guests determines their 
desire to return and to refer your B&B to others.
Making guests want to come 
back again and again
Going the extra mile is the key to delivering the genuine hospitality that 
makes guests want to come back again and again, as well as refer you to their 
friends. Showing care and concern for your guests’ comfort and happiness 
is the secret to making your bed & breakfast number one in your guests’ 
eyes. Consider it a compliment if your guests are planning their next trip to 
your inn before they’ve even checked out. Here are some tips and ideas to 
make that happen:
 
✓ Ask open-ended questions. Most B&B guests are the nicest people in 
the world, and they don’t want to be thought of as complainers. As 
such, they may be reluctant to tell you if something is wrong with their 
room or if they need something. You can draw guests out by asking 
open-ended questions, such as “How is your stay going?” or “How is 
your room working for you?” Successful innkeepers know to ask, “How 
is your ice holding out?” rather than “Do you need more ice?” The first 
question is more of a conversation generator than the second, which 
elicits only a simple yes or no response. Guests quickly pick up on 
your willingness to be of service to them, and it sets the stage for a 
pleasant stay.

244
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
✓ Show interest in your guests’ enjoyment. Guests notice when you care 
enough to inquire whether they’re enjoying their getaway, and this type 
of hospitality is guaranteed to make your inn stand out. For example, the 
Walnut Lane Inn in Lyman, South Carolina (www.walnutlaneinn.com) 
has installed an inexpensive motion detector in the corner of the front 
door that rings in the owners’ quarters. Not only does this let the 
innkeepers know when someone is coming or going, it also allows them 
to greet their guests after dinner to ask how their dinner was and to 
confirm breakfast times.
 
✓ Make restaurant or activity suggestions and offer to make reservations 
for your guests. Providing this service helps you in several ways:
 
• The guests appreciate the personal attention you’re offering by 
making suggestions and reservations. They also appreciate your 
letting them know when you think they wouldn’t enjoy a particular 
restaurant or activity, and why.
 
• If you send numerous referrals to any one establishment, your 
guests are likely to be treated especially well, which is a nice 
reflection on you.
 
• Giving referrals may beget referrals. When you make the reserva-
tions yourself, other local businesses know that the referral is 
coming from you. You never know when they may be in a position 
to send a referral your way.
 
✓ Serve a light breakfast for early check-outs. Often, guests who need to 
leave early will tell you not to worry about their breakfast. However, 
they’re usually extraordinarily appreciative of your extra hospitality 
if you can offer a light breakfast or “breakfast-to-go” before their 
departure.
 
✓ Offer guests amenities and extras they wouldn’t typically receive at 
a hotel. For example, if you’re near a beach, provide complimentary 
beach chairs and umbrellas. If there are bike trails nearby, consider 
offering the use of bicycles (check with your insurance carrier to be 
sure you’re covered in the event that a guest is injured). If you’re near 
a train or bus station or airport you may want to offer a pick-up service 
for your guests, provided they don’t need a car during the remainder 
of their stay. (Check with your insurance carrier to be sure that you 
are adequately covered when transporting guests.) Other common 
amenities innkeepers offer their guests are the ability to borrow DVDs 
and access to a full cookie jar!
 
 It’s important to recognize, however, when abundance is too much. 
Guests love the feeling of getting a good value and being spoiled, but 
to be a successful innkeeper and business owner, you must always 
keep a careful eye on expenses. You need to be sure that the cost of the 
amenities you provide to your guests is justified in the rates you charge. 
(See Chapter 3 for help in creating a plan for your business, including 
estimating the cost of amenities.)

245
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
✓ Display a level of thoughtfulness that’s out of the ordinary. For 
example, at Sunrise Landing B&B in Dundee, New York, (www.sunrise
landingbb.com), the innkeepers offer to take each guest’s picture. 
They then surprise them by putting it in a gold foil frame as a take-home 
memory of their stay. On the back of the picture they put the inn’s 
business card with their contact information and Web address. Guests 
love the thoughtfulness of this gesture, and it keeps the inn foremost in 
their minds when friends ask them for a referral.
 
When guests choose your inn, they are choosing you, your hospitality, and 
your concierge services over hotels and other inns in the area, so pay 
attention to your guests. Always be on the lookout for little extras you can 
add that will make your guests not only want to return, but also refer you to 
their family and friends.
Knowing when to be quiet
Despite your desire to anticipate and fulfill your guests’ every need, one 
of the most important skills you should have is knowing when to be quiet. 
This is tough for many innkeepers, because most have very outgoing 
personalities. However, from time to time you’ll get guests who, for whatever 
reason, simply prefer to be left alone.
Be aware that sometimes you’ll read the situation correctly and sometimes 
you’ll get it wrong. For example, when a guest gives you a one- or two-word 
answer, you may be dealing with a person of few words or it may be an 
important cue that the guest doesn’t want to engage in conversation. This 
is where people-reading skills come in handy. When you have guests that 
you think would prefer to be left alone, simply let them know you’re available 
if they need you. You might say something like, “There are extra pillows and 
blankets in the closet, and if you need more, or if there is anything else you 
need, please let me know.”
As an innkeeper you need to know when to be quiet and also to sense when 
there’s too much quiet. It can be equally difficult to get a conversation 
started at breakfast when there’s an awkward silence. The weather, local 
sights, or the food are usually safe conversation-starters. Avoid discussing 
politics, religion, and environmental issues.
 
At some point, most guests will ask you why you decided to become an inn-
keeper. Never answer with your complete life story and the evolution of your 
bed & breakfast. Start with a very short answer. If the guest asks you more 
questions, you can give them more details.

246
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Keeping Guests Safe and Comfortable
Guests need to feel safe and comfortable in order to feel taken care of. As an 
innkeeper, you need to be concerned about a variety of forms of guest safety, 
including:
 
✓ Your guest’s physical safety: Not only do you need to be sure locks on 
your doors and windows are secure to keep perpetrators out, but you 
also need to be sure that guests can move freely around the inn without 
worry of injury. (See Chapter 9 for information on safety considerations 
when furnishing your inn.)
 
✓ Your guests’ perception of safety: Guests need the comfort of feeling 
safe. A guest from a rural environment may feel uneasy at an urban 
inn in a large city, but you can attempt to alleviate the guest’s fears by 
reassuring the guest with specific suggestions about how to get around 
and where to go.
 
✓ Compliance with required safety procedures and codes: Many safety 
requirements are mandated by federal, state, and local law. Others are 
required by various inspection and rating agencies. (See Chapter 5 for 
information on zoning and other legalities.)
 
✓ Food safety: The last thing you want is for guests to get sick at your 
inn because the food they ate was bad. Proper refrigeration, storage, 
and cooking procedures need to be practiced diligently for guests’ 
safety. The health department will inspect your facilities and practices 
concerning safe food handling, storing, and preparation, and in many 
U.S. jurisdictions, you will be required to pass the ServSafe Food test 
(for more info, check out www.servsafe.com).
 
Guests should know how to reach you or a staff member at all times, even 
during the night. Good communication is key to a guest’s well-being and 
feeling of safety, and knowing how to reach you is an essential component of 
this communication.
Being prepared for emergencies
The first few minutes after an emergency occurs are the most critical. You 
must react to protect your guests, yourself, and your B&B. Learning as much 
as you can about what to do in an emergency helps you to be prepared. 
Beyond calling 911, which you should do immediately in an emergency, here 
are some things to consider ahead of time:
 
✓ Know basic first aid. Take a first aid training class to know how to help 
a guest who is choking. Checking with your insurance company and 
your attorney for legal advice in rendering medical aid is a good idea.

247
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
✓ Keep basic first aid supplies on hand. Have bandages, ice packs 
(or frozen peas), antibiotic ointment, and so on available for guests 
who suffer minor injuries.
 
✓ Have smoke and carbon monoxide detectors installed and checked 
frequently.
 
✓ Stay up-to-date on all zoning, health, and safety requirements.
 
✓ Have fire extinguishers handy, especially in the kitchen.
 
✓ Know what to do in the event of a kitchen fire:
 
•  Use caution when cooking with grease and alcohol because they’re 
very flammable.
 
• Don’t attempt to extinguish grease fires with water.
 
• Small grease fires in a pan can be extinguished by placing a lid on 
the pan to cut off the oxygen supply to the fire.
 
• Baking soda may be thrown on small grease fires or electrical fires.
 
• If a fire breaks out in the oven, close the oven door and turn off 
the heat.
 
• Don’t wear loose-fitting clothing that can easily catch fire when 
cooking.
 
• If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop, and roll to put the fire out.
 
✓ Prepare an evacuation plan for each room and post it in each guest 
room. Show guests the emergency exits when giving them a welcome 
tour of the inn. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regardless of the size of 
the inn, you are required to ask each guest whether he would need 
assistance vacating the building in the event of an emergency.
 
All staff should be trained for what to do in an emergency and you should 
conduct drills at least once a year. Does everyone know where to turn off the 
power, gas, and water, and are there tools readily available to do so? In the 
unfortunate event that your inn is in the center of a disaster, your staff should 
be instructed ahead of time not to speak with the press, and it’s a good idea 
for you to speak with your insurance agent before speaking with the press 
yourself.
Having a contingency plan when 
a guest’s stay is interrupted
Occasionally things that are out of your control happen to interrupt a guest’s 
stay. Instead of wasting a lot of time worrying about what could go wrong, 
plan ahead by creating a contingency plan. For example, if construction work 
outside your inn knocks out electricity to the B&B, how will you handle it?

248
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
If you’ve made it a point to get to know the other inns in your area, you’re 
probably all set (see Chapter 1 for recommendations on talking with 
other successful innkeepers). Innkeepers often help one another by accom-
modating each other’s guests in emergencies. Be sure you know the caliber 
of the B&Bs that you make these arrangements with, because how you 
handle the guests’ accommodations when plans need to be changed — even 
if the circumstances are beyond your control — reflects on you and your 
inn. Despite being friends with many of the innkeepers with whom you may 
have your guests stay during an emergency, consider staying somewhere 
else yourself if you have to leave along with your guests. It’s often more 
comfortable for everyone concerned.
 
Keep emergency phone numbers on hand, and provide a clear way for your 
guests to contact emergency responders in your area. (See the Cheat Sheet for 
a list of important numbers to keep in speed dial.)
 
A great resource for business preparedness and contingency planning is www.

Handling Problem Guests — And Ohhh 
Are They Out There!
Some of the most difficult times innkeepers face are the challenges that 
problem guests bring, knowingly and unknowingly. As an innkeeper, I’m sure 
you possess a strong sense of pride about your inn and a strong desire for 
all your guests to have a fabulous stay at your B&B. Problem guests threaten 
one or both of these strongly held passions. Fortunately, wonderful guests 
are far more abundant than problem guests.
The problems guests cause range from mildly annoying to serious breaches 
of your policies. You can prepare for some problems by using waterproof 
mattress covers and buying a carpet cleaner, but other issues require a more 
personal touch to resolve. As the host, the owner, and the innkeeper, you 
must be firmly in charge and able to maintain control to protect your inn and 
the enjoyment and comfort of all your guests. The best way to do that is to 
prevent problems by having firm policies and enforcing them as necessary. 
(See Chapter 7 for help in setting and sticking to your policies.) The following 
sections describe common situations and how to handle them when things 
get out of hand.
 
Always use your best judgment. Accidents happen. Know when to be gracious 
and when to hold the line.

249
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
 
Friends who are innkeepers and innkeeper associations and forums provide 
a good source of support. They’re a great place to let off steam and bounce 
ideas around about how to deal with problem guests. Even seasoned inn-
keepers need to let off steam occasionally. (See Chapter 1 to find valuable 
innkeeper resources.)
Ignoring your policies
Guests may ignore your policies for a variety of reasons. Each situation is 
unique and deserves individual consideration. Your job is to make sure your 
policies are clear and clearly communicated to guests and then to decide 
which policies require enforcement. Look at each situation and determine 
how big of a deal it is. Some policies are nonnegotiable because their breach 
interferes with other guests’ enjoyment or causes damage to your inn. Others 
require simple reminders.
For example, sometimes guests lose track of time. They enjoy breakfast and 
go back to their room to relax for a few minutes, and then miss check-out 
time. Gentle reminders usually help in this situation. In the rare instance that 
guests refuse to leave, you can offer to store their luggage so they can check 
out. Some innkeepers impose (or threaten to impose) an extra charge, but 
this method doesn’t put more time on the clock for you to turn over the room 
for the next guest.
Guests smoking in their room requires a stronger response from you. Most 
innkeepers at the first whiff of smoke will knock on the guest’s door and 
remind them of the no-smoking policy. Smoke is bothersome to other current 
guests as well as to future guests who will occupy the room, plus it’s a fire 
hazard. So this policy, and others like it, should be strictly enforced.
Acting inappropriately
You want your guests to enjoy themselves, but where do you draw the line? 
When their behavior can cause harm to themselves or to other guests, when 
it interferes with other guests’ enjoyment or the safety of the inn, you must 
decide how to intervene. These situations can be tricky because they may 
not be associated with polices that you can refer to, so you’ll need to look at 
each situation individually before you decide on a course of action.
For example, intoxicated guests may do damage to your inn and interfere 
with other guests. One intoxicated guest who had trouble closing the front 
door to an inn severely jammed a small rug under the door in the process. 
As a result, no one could get in or out. This was a huge fire and safety issue. 
The innkeeper had been away for a few hours that evening and when she 
returned, she was luckily able to gain entry through the innkeeper entrance. 
She then worked for over an hour cutting away the jammed rug.

250
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
When asked how to deal with intoxicated guests, most innkeepers recom-
mend making the determination based on whether the person is being a 
disturbance to other guests or whether he’s causing damage to the inn. If 
there’s damage, the party is over and the intoxicated guest must be sternly 
told this. How you do this is up to you and depends on the circumstances. 
You may need to insist that the guest retire for the evening or, if the situation 
is disorderly and dangerous, you may need to call the authorities for help. 
On the other hand, if you have a spot where guests can socialize without 
disturbing other guests and damaging important property, direct rowdy 
guests to this area.
Running group interference
Making sure your guests understand your policies takes on even greater 
importance when several rooms are rented to a group at the same time that 
other guests are also staying at the inn.
Recently, an inn with rave reviews from previous guests received two very 
negative online reviews because a group that had rented most, but not all, 
of the inn allowed their kids to run and jump in the hot tub while other guests 
were trying to relax in it. When one of the children told his mom he was 
going to get sick, the child’s parents didn’t appreciate that the innkeeper 
immediately asked for all the children to be taken out of the hot tub. They 
wrote a negative review because they felt they had been treated unfairly. One 
of the other guests also wrote a negative review, having felt outnumbered by 
the group and uncomfortable at the inn. Because of situations like this, many 
innkeepers accept groups only when renting the entire inn to the same party. 
Other innkeepers steer completely clear of groups and do not encourage 
entire inn rentals.
Causing damages
Innkeepers often wrestle with how to handle damages, especially since often-
times the damage isn’t discovered until after the guests have checked out. 
To protect yourself and the inn, your damages policy must be clear and 
guests should acknowledge and sign it at check-in (see the “Checking guests 
in” section for information about reservation cards/folios). When damages 
do occur, take pictures before cleaning or repairing the damage. Then if you 
decide to charge the guest a damage or cleaning fee, you’ll have supporting 
documentation if the guest disputes the charge. Often the existence of a 
damage policy acts as a deterrent to behavior that could cause damage to 
the inn, so whether or not you decide to enforce such a policy you should 
have one in place.

251
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Guests
Don’t be afraid, however, to enforce your damage policy and charge guests 
for damage to your inn. (Check with your credit card processor to see 
what documentation is required and what a guest needs to sign in order for 
you to charge their credit card for damages or a cleaning fee.) Remember, 
however, that accidents happen and are a part of doing business, so there’s 
a delicate balance here. For less serious violations, gentle reminders are 
often sufficient, and when minor damages occur, you should usually consider 
it a cost of doing business.
If your inn accommodates pets, it’s not unusual to charge an additional 
cleaning fee as well as have a specific policy for damages caused by pets. 
The cleaning fee would be automatic and separate from any charges for 
damage that the pet may cause.
Being just plain difficult
Ah, the picky eater. Guests have an uncanny way of suddenly being allergic 
to menu items, being on strange diets, or taking a dislike to certain foods at 
the last minute. Even if you ask about allergies and dietary restrictions when 
you take guest reservations, expect to encounter this. Sometimes innkeepers 
post their menus the night before to circumvent these issues ahead of time; 
others think this only opens up the situation to problems.
No matter how you handle your menus ahead of time, there are still guests 
who, when served the meal, say, “Oh no, I can’t eat that.” If you decide to 
prepare something custom for them, don’t be surprised if they leave the 
table with the special order you created for them uneaten as well. You should 
also be aware that this becomes an open invitation for everyone to order 
something different, turning you into a short-order cook. On the plus side, 
you’ll occasionally find the guest who never eats sweets gobbling up your 
crème brûlée French toast!
But by far the most difficult people are those with a narcissistic attitude. 
These are the people who believe that the universe revolves around them 
and no one else. They display belligerent behavior, make demands just for 
the heck of it, ask for things for the sheer pleasure of throwing the stuff 
around, ask for food they don’t intend to eat, question your policies, take 
two spaces to park their car in the parking lot — I think you get the picture. 
Sometimes you can swing their mood by continuing to be cheerful and 
friendly, and sometimes you just know that you can only go so far. Most 
importantly, don’t let them intimidate you into skimping on your check-in 
policies. This is why it’s a good idea to always
 
✓ Have guests sign before giving them their room key.
 
✓ Confirm upon check-in the number of people in the party and the 
number of rooms reserved.

252
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
✓ Remind guests of your smoking policy.
 
✓ Remind guests that if everyone parks politely in the parking lot, there 
will be room for all guests to park.
 
✓ Settle charges upon check-in.
On the flip side, prepare yourself for overly friendly or lonely guests who 
follow you everywhere, making it difficult for you to get anything done or 
just plain driving you crazy. Of course, you don’t want to hurt their feelings, 
however sometimes you need to tell them “I need to excuse myself to get 
rooms ready for the next guest” or “If I don’t excuse myself to run some 
errands, we won’t have anything for breakfast tomorrow”. Offer to give them 
recommendations for area activities, show them the lending library of books, 
DVDs, or magazines, and politely yet forcefully leave so that you can get your 
work done or enjoy a little time to yourself.
Checking Guests Out
If you’ve taken care of securing the method of payment when you check 
guests in, check-out is less formal, which is a nice way to end the visit. Key 
things you want to do are:
 
✓ Give guests a copy of their final bill.
 
✓ Have guests return their keys.
 
✓ Help guests with their luggage.
 
✓ Offer help with directions and questions.
 
✓ Look guests in the eye, thank them for choosing your inn, and invite 
them back. Shake their hand (or give a hug if appropriate).
 
How you say good-bye to each guest depends on the interaction and relation-
ship you’ve developed with them during their stay. It’s your guests’ last 
impression of your inn before they tell others about your B&B, so make it a 
comfortable, genuine, and positive farewell.

Chapter 13
Maintaining Your Inn
In This Chapter
▶ Organizing your to-do list into schedules and chore checklists
▶ Planning your attack on daily chores and bigger cleaning jobs
▶ Selecting the right equipment for your needs
▶ Taking good care of outdoor space
Your guests come in all shapes and sizes, yet they have one thing in 
common — they all expect clean and well-maintained accommodations. 
So cleaning is one area that you can’t compromise on. It’s up to you to set 
standards for the cleanliness of your inn — and stick to ’em.
Luckily the best techniques for achieving a totally clean and well-maintained 
inn aren’t a mystery. Here’s the foundation of what’s required:
 
✓ Organization: Create a schedule and a checklist to help keep you and 
your staff on track.
 
✓ Hard work: Even with a few shortcuts and tips, cleaning is hard work. 
There’s no way around it.
 
✓ Flexibility: Interruptions are guaranteed when you operate a B&B, so 
you must be able to address them, prioritize your tasks, and, in the end, 
still present a clean inn to your guests.
 
✓ High standards: Clean begins with you. You set the standards for your 
inn. If you have staff, you must lead by example and show them what 
clean means at your B&B.
 
 The best way to be sure your rooms and other areas are getting cleaned 
to your high standards is to periodically clean them yourself.

254
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
This chapter helps you to make sure that your inn sparkles in the eyes of 
your guests (even the neatniks). In this chapter, I help you to create 
organized schedules so you can stay one step (or more) ahead of your 
endless cleaning and maintenance tasks — both inside your inn and outside, 
attending to lawn and garden maintenance. To give you a head start, I share 
schedules from other successful innkeepers as well as explain equipment 
must-haves and options.
Establishing Schedules 
and Chore Checklists
Keep your inn in tip-top shape by establishing a cleaning and maintenance 
schedule so that tasks and issues don’t have the chance to build up. This 
is easier said than done, and you should never lose sight of the fact that 
running a bed & breakfast is a huge job and responsibility. On many days 
the tasks will seem daunting and overwhelming. The best ways to stay on top 
of maintenance are to be organized (or at least start out that way) and to be 
flexible, accepting the likelihood of interruptions.
I suggest that you create one schedule for each category of task frequency: 
cleaning and maintenance that needs to be done daily (such as making 
and cleaning up from breakfast), several times a week (such as watering 
the lawn), weekly (such as taking out recyclables), monthly (such as vacuum-
ing the bathroom exhaust grates), and less frequently (such as washing 
windows). Each schedule should contain a checklist of the tasks for that 
frequency and may call out the rooms or spaces that get such attention. A 
checklist with each schedule not only gives you a feeling of being in control 
of the cleaning and maintenance of your inn, but also makes it less likely 
that you (or your staff) will forget something. After all, it’s better for you to 
discover that renegade dust bunny than for a guest to find it!
When you’re a busy innkeeper, it’s tempting to jump right in each day and get 
as much done as you can, but you’ll be more productive if you outline each 
important time block in the day and prioritize essential tasks. Consider these 
schedules:
 
✓ Daily schedule: A consistent, organized daily routine cuts down on the 
amount of time spent cleaning and means fewer headaches for you and a 
cleaner inn for your guests. The section, “Dealing with Daily Chores,” 
later in this chapter provides an explanation of daily tasks as well as 
an example of a daily housekeeping schedule with a checklist for daily 
tasks and the rooms and areas in which they should be performed. 

255
 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
Your daily schedule won’t necessarily look like that one, but it’s a useful 
guide. After you create and start to use a daily schedule, you’ll find 
yourself adapting it to work better for you, such as freshening up guest 
rooms before finishing the breakfast cleanup (remembering, of course, 
to clear breakfast items from guests’ view first!). You can then proceed 
with a daily schedule that works best for you, keeping in mind that no 
two days have to be the same and that frequent interruptions are part 
of the job.
 
 Developing a daily routine and grouping similar tasks helps to keep 
the inn’s rhythm on a schedule so you know, for example, what time is 
allotted for gardening or errand running or food shopping and when 
you must shift gears to doing laundry, sending out reservation confirma-
tions, and prepping tomorrow morning’s breakfast. Many days you 
simply can’t stick to the same order of tasks, but you’ll become a pro 
at prioritizing what can and can’t wait until the next day.
 
✓ Weekly schedule: A weekly schedule lets you see each day and the 
whole week together at a glance. It can not only tell you who’s handling 
each task on the checklist but also can ensure that all chores are cov-
ered. The section, “Weekly cleaning,” later in this chapter includes an 
example of a weekly schedule.
 
✓ Less frequent deep cleaning and maintenance schedule: Periodically 
you’ll need to do a deep cleaning and perform preventative maintenance 
and upkeep that involves heavy-duty hard work. A schedule with a 
checklist of such infrequent deep cleaning and maintenance tasks is 
the easiest way to keep track of how long it has been since a task was 
done. This schedule also keeps such tasks on your radar to ensure 
they’re not overlooked. You can find out more about the tasks in this 
schedule in the “Deep cleaning” section later in this chapter.
 
Be sure to schedule time for bookkeeping, banking, bill paying, and running 
errands. These tasks may vary in frequency from running errands every few 
days to paying bills weekly. Don’t be surprised to find out that it’s the tasks 
that only you can do that are the ones that get put off, such as entering items 
in your accounting software.
 
Without planned schedules and checklists, you may find yourself wasting 
valuable time doubling back to do forgotten tasks. Your schedules also are 
great tools for training housekeeping staff or people who simply lend a hand 
at the last minute.
You decide the order in which you work through the tasks on your schedules 
based upon the layout of your inn as well as whether guests leave early or 
wait until the last minute to check out. Experience will help you to develop a 
rhythm and a desired order of doing things.

256
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Regardless of the layout of your inn or how you decide to schedule your 
cleaning chores, here are some tips to keep you and your schedules 
organized:
 
✓ Clean the same items in one sweep while you have the right supplies 
with you, like cleaning all bathrooms before moving on to a different 
task. (This is an ideal routing and may not be possible if some guests 
remain in their rooms.) If you’re working with a partner, increase 
efficiency by assigning different jobs to each person. For example, one 
person cleans the bathrooms while the other strips the beds. This way 
no one has to stop and change cleaning supplies and tools for each task.
 
✓ Perform repairs and routine maintenance as needed, rather than 
putting them off for a later date. Keeping up-to-date with repairs and 
maintenance keeps your inn looking good to guests and your appliances 
and equipment in good working order.
 
✓ Collect all your cleaning supplies into a cleaning bucket or bag. You 
save valuable time in your cleaning schedule when you have all your 
cleaning supplies with you and don’t have to waste time by stopping to 
go and get something.
It takes most innkeepers several years to establish solid schedules and a 
routine that makes them feel in control. Don’t be discouraged. Know that 
you’ll feel overwhelmed with all that needs to be done in a day, a week, a 
month, and a year, and seek out support from other innkeepers. (Chapter 1 
has advice on finding other innkeepers with whom you can commiserate 
and from whom you can learn a thing or two.)
Dealing with Daily Chores
You’ll quickly learn that an innkeeper’s work is never done. Your to-do list 
may seem endless, but there are certain tasks and chores that must be done 
every day in order to maintain your inn and to ensure that things are clean 
and ready for guests. In the next sections, I help you identify and tackle these 
daily jobs.
Taking the fear out of 
cleaning guest rooms
Trust me, I know how alarming it can be to find underwear under a guest’s 
bed or a dead fly in the window sill and wonder how long it has been 

257
 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
there. You can’t catch everything in every room, but having a schedule and 
checklist and training your staff in the art of cleaning helps to prevent many 
of these occurrences.
When it comes to guests’ rooms, the following two scenarios affect your 
daily tasks. My explanations include some of the terminology and scheduling 
procedures that most innkeepers use in keeping their guest rooms clean.
 
✓ The guest is staying another night: For rooms in which the guests are 
returning, fluffing refers to making the bed; replacing necessary linens, 
glassware, and so on; cleaning the bathroom; vacuuming; emptying 
the wastebasket; and tidying up anything else so that the room is clean 
when the guests return. Depending on the number of nights the guests 
are staying, fluffing may also include changing bed linens. In general, 
bed linens are changed every two to three days unless they’re stained. 
This is the norm; however, you can set different standards for your 
inn. Depending on whether your inn offers a linen reuse program, 
the same choice is yours with towels. Otherwise, towels are usually 
replaced daily.
 
 Water and energy conservation is a growing concern these days, and a 
linen reuse program lets you address both issues. Give guests the option 
of reusing towels. Many inns have small signs in the bathroom that say 
something like, “We are proud of being a ‘green’ inn. Towels left in the 
tub means you want them replaced, and towels left on the hooks means 
you want to reuse them.”
 
✓ The guest checks out: When a guest checks out, you perform a flip or 
turn-over in order to make the room ready for the next guest. It’s a more 
intense cleaning with the goal of making the room clean and new. A 
turn-over includes stripping the bed linens; disinfecting the bathroom; 
washing tub mats; dusting; vacuuming; checking under beds, in every 
drawer, and in all closets; and cleaning the hot tub and more to remove 
all traces of the previous guests.
 
If your arriving guests aren’t checking in on the same day as your departing 
guests, you may pull the linens and wait until the day the new guests arrive to 
fully turn over the room. It’s a good habit to always turn over your rooms 
when guests depart. If walk-ins (guests who arrive without a reservation) are 
common in your area, you should always do turn-over immediately so your 
rooms are always ready.
 
If you do a complete turn-over and the room sits empty for more than a day or 
two before guests finally arrive, do a walkthrough and freshen up the room 
with a light dusting and by running the water in the tub and sinks, flushing the 
toilets, and so on.

258
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
The cleaning schedules and procedures for cleaning your guest rooms will be 
unique to your inn and they will change over time. However, here are some 
safe assumptions you can make when cleaning guest rooms:
 
✓ Hot tubs and Jacuzzis require special cleaning. In many areas you 
may need to have board of health approval in order to operate a hot 
tub or Jacuzzi, and your local health department may have specific 
standards that you must follow if you offer these amenities, including 
passing inspections to be sure hot tubs are cleaned properly. Check 
with your local department of health for cleaning and regulation 
requirements.
 
✓ The fastest and neatest way to make a bed involves two people 
sharing the job. You quickly realize how much time you save not 
running from one side to the other! A bed made by two people 
comes out neater and crisper, with fewer wrinkles, so it looks better 
to guests.
 
✓ Guests check under beds and behind things to make sure that they 
don’t leave anything when checking out, so you or your cleaning 
staff must clean under the bed, behind the armoire, and behind the 
curtains, among other unseen or hard to reach areas.
 
✓ If you have the help of a housekeeper, have her clean the bathrooms 
(which you check later) while you review the finer details, or touch-
ups. It’s your inn, and its presentation is a reflection on you. Focus on 
the little details, like the following, that make a big impression on guests 
(or take away from their impressions of your place):
 
• Alarm clocks: Make sure the alarm isn’t set to go off and the time 
is correct. Don’t forget to adjust the time for daylight savings.
 
• Pictures: Check that pictures are hung straight on the walls, and 
dust the frames, including the tops.
 
• Dust: Dust the tops of doors and door jams where dust likes to 
collect.
 
• Shades and blinds: Adjust shades and blind heights so that they’re 
all even.
Figure 13-1 is a daily chore schedule from the Inn at the Riverbend (www.
innatriverbend.com), a seven-room bed & breakfast in Pearisburg, 
Virginia. You can use the checklist on this schedule as a starting point and 
for ideas of how to create your own daily guest room schedule with checklist. 
The bold items are usually done when fluffing the rooms. The inn also notes 
arriving guests on the schedule, which serves as a reminder to double-check 
and freshen up rooms that had previously been turned over but weren’t 
immediately rented to new guests.

Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Moving guests’ belongings when cleaning
New innkeepers often wonder whether and how much to move guests’ 
belongings around when cleaning, and the answer is very little. If you need to 
move money or valuables in order to clean, you should put them back where 
they were. Neatly folding guests’ clothes and leaving them where you found 
them is often appreciated, but moving them any further could be considered 
intrusive.
Sometimes guests request that you don’t clean their rooms during their stay. 
They may feel uncomfortable having you clean their rooms, they may be 
unfamiliar with staying at B&Bs, or they may just be very private people. 
How you handle this request is up to you. For many innkeepers, it’s an easy 
decision: The guest asks for privacy, and the request is granted. Other inn-
keepers may say something like, “Are you sure? We like to freshen the rooms 
for all our guests,” or “It’s not a problem. We’ll just empty the trash and leave 
some fresh towels for you, if that’s okay.”
 
First and foremost, you should always respect your guests’ privacy. If guests 
insist that you don’t enter their rooms, you should respect their wishes unless 
you suspect a serious reason to check that everything’s okay in the rooms.
Handling guests’ belongings that are left behind
Generally, the best policy is to wait for guests to call about their forgotten 
items. You can never be 100 percent sure that the items weren’t left by a 
previous guest and simply missed during the room turn-over.
However, depending upon what’s left behind and even the quantity, such as 
prescription medications or more clothes than just one or two items, you 
should use discretion and make an attempt to contact the guest as soon as 
possible. (There’s nothing like returning lingerie to an assumed wife only 
to find out the wife was not a guest!) Many times you can reach guests with 
cellphones before they’ve left the area, and they can swing by the inn and 
pick up their items.
Keeping common areas looking their best
It’s important that guests feel comfortable in your bed & breakfast, but not all 
guests have common sense when it comes to knowing how to be respectful 
and pick up after themselves in the common areas of your inn. Expect some 
guests to be very tidy, while others drink coffee or tea, have a cookie or some 
cheese and crackers, and then leave their half-eaten food on the tables in 
common areas for other guests to look at.
It’s your job as innkeeper to continually make sweeps through your inn, 
including the outdoor areas, to keep things tidy. Deciding when to clean 
common areas is a balancing act, because although guests expect a clean 

261
 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
inn, many are uncomfortable watching you do the cleaning. So try to clean 
common areas when many guests are away from the inn, such as between 
check-out and check-in, during the evening, and then again, if needed, at 
the end of your innkeeping day.
 
Many guests want to be neat, but they don’t know what to do with their dishes 
when they’re finished with them. Set up a collection point in an obvious place, 
for example, a fancy tea cart next to a wastebasket in the hospitality room or 
parlor.
A clean kitchen is a happy kitchen
Being able to close the door to a dirty kitchen and deal with it later is a great 
feeling, especially when a hundred other important things are clamoring for 
your attention. For instance, you often have to stop loading the dishwasher 
in order to wish guests a nice farewell as they check out or to answer the 
phone to take a reservation (or both!). However, closing the kitchen door is 
only a temporary solution. A clean kitchen not only helps to keep you more 
organized, but it’s also necessary to meet local and state health department 
guidelines.
There is no “best time” to clean the kitchen; however, all clean, unused 
foods from your breakfast preparation must be wrapped and placed in the 
refrigerator or freezer immediately after breakfast. Many innkeepers find that 
doing the laundry and the kitchen cleanup in tandem works best because 
they can move between tasks. They first start the laundry and keep an eye on 
it while they clean the kitchen.
 
In addition to the obvious daily cleaning tasks in your kitchen, at least every 
few months don’t forget to clean the refrigerator, freezer, and pantry and to 
rotate items. Also, be sure to continuously throw out unused items as they 
reach their expiration dates.
Laundry miracles
As you plan for your bed & breakfast, you may wonder, “How difficult can it 
be to wash sheets and towels?” It doesn’t take long to discover the answer 
to that question . . . it’s not as easy as it looks! No matter how much you can 
accomplish in any given day, you’ll sometimes find yourself questioning 
whether there’s a bottom to your laundry pile! Keeping linens spot-free and 
fresh for the traveling public is very different from washing your family’s 
clothes. A faint spot or two on a pillowcase or sheet that you wouldn’t think 
twice about for your own use may cause a guest to think that the linens 
aren’t clean. For this reason, many innkeepers choose white linens because 
they can be bleached with no worry about fading.

262
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
Unless you have a separate water source for your laundry, you shouldn’t do 
laundry in the morning or evening when guests may be showering. Planning 
your laundry time appropriately ensures that guests have adequate hot water 
and water pressure.
In deciding whether to purchase commercial or household laundry equip-
ment, consider your answers to the following questions:
 
✓ How much time will be devoted to the laundry each day?
 
✓ During what time frame will the laundry be done?
 
✓ Who will do the laundry?
The answers to these questions are intertwined with each other. What’s right 
for your inn depends upon your budget, how many rooms you have, your 
occupancy rate, how much linen you have per room, and how much staff 
you have or don’t have. Generally, an inn with less than five rooms can use 
non-commercial equipment, although some inns of this size have two wash-
ers and dryers. Commercial appliances are fabulous but they’re expensive. 
For this reason, many innkeepers start out with residential appliances and 
upgrade later. Another option to explore is an outside linen service for 
washing, drying, and ironing your linens. Some innkeepers have found the 
time savings outweighs the cost. Unfortunately, if your inn is in a remote 
location, this may not be an option for you to consider.
 
Using household appliances for commercial use may void their warranties.
Easing the task of ironing linens
You may be asking, “What’s a mangle?”, but if 
you use one, your question may well be, “How 
could I ever live without it?” A mangle is a 
heated roller rotary iron (Miele is a popular 
brand). Sheets, pillowcases, tablecloths, place-
mats, napkins, and similarly flat items simply 
roll through the mangle and come out looking 
professionally pressed. It’s a huge time saver! 
A mangle uses dry heat, so it works best on 
items that are still damp.
Although the mangle is a miracle appliance in 
the eyes of many innkeepers, it’s big and expen-
sive. For most small inns starting out, a mangle 
is a luxury. Some innkeepers opt to make this 
purchase during startup simply because of the 
time they’ll save and be able to devote to other 
tasks. Other innkeepers hold off on purchasing 
a mangle until they’re more established, and 
still others never own a mangle. It’s a big deci-
sion and a large expense, so if you have an inn-
keeper friend who has one, see if you can try 
his first. A table-top steam press (ElnaPress is a 
popular brand) is a less expensive alternative 
for pressing pillowcases, napkins, and place-
mats, but it’s not large enough for pressing bed 
sheets or large tablecloths.

263
 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
 
In general, it takes longer to dry a load of linens and towels than to wash it, so 
some inns have two dryers. Consider that option depending on how many 
linens and loads of laundry you anticipate doing daily, because your goal is to 
crank through large amounts of laundry as quickly as possible on a daily basis 
with spot-free results.
Finally, launder with soft water. One of the big secrets to soft, fluffy towels 
that your guests are guaranteed to love is washing your linens in soft water. 
Hard water is rough on laundry because it contains mineral deposits that 
cause laundry detergent to become trapped in the fibers of your linens, 
leaving them with a rough, scratchy feeling. (Hard water also leads to soap 
buildup and spots on your dishes when they come out of the dishwasher.) 
Installing a commercial water softener (you can either buy or lease) has 
many laundry benefits to both the inn and the guests. A water softener uses 
up to 3/4 less detergent in each wash load, eliminates the need for fabric 
softener, and produces considerable energy savings because soft water heats 
faster than hard water.
Fitting In Bigger Cleaning Jobs
Thankfully, there are many tasks that you don’t have to do every day yet 
they’re still essential to the maintenance and appearance of your inn and 
your guests’ experiences at your inn. The next sections help you tackle 
these tasks.
Weekly cleaning
In addition to daily cleaning chores, some innkeepers do a weekly cleaning 
that involves tasks that need to be done regularly — just not as often as daily 
tasks (which I cover in the “Dealing with Daily Chores” section earlier). Some 
innkeepers devote one day each week to giving main areas a more thorough 
cleaning; other innkeepers handle these jobs throughout the week by spend-
ing extra time in different areas each day. For example, Mondays may include 
giving the dining room a good scrub-down, Tuesdays may include extra atten-
tion in the living room, and Wednesdays (or whenever there’s turn-over) may 
include giving guest rooms a heavy scrubbing and disinfecting.
 
Like your daily schedule, your weekly cleaning schedule is unique to your 
inn. It’s built around how busy your inn is and if and when you have staff to 
help you.
Figure 13-2 shows the weekly cleaning schedule at the Inn at Riverbend in 
Virginia. The task checklist is broken down by the day, time, and person 
responsible. Having such a checklist tailored to the chores at your B&B 
makes it clear who’s responsible for various tasks. It also lets everyone 
know which tasks are being taken care of and which ones need attention.

Deep cleaning
Deep cleaning is your heavy cleaning and maintenance. It includes moving 
furniture to vacuum behind it, washing curtains, cleaning ceiling fans, and 
changing air filters, among other tasks. You can tackle heavy cleaning on 
whatever schedule works best — it’s usually done twice a year or more.
You’ll always be tempted to put off the big cleaning and maintenance jobs, 
so I recommend penciling out a schedule and checklist for them. When 
you write it down, you’re more likely to actually do it. And unless your B&B 
is closed for a month or longer each year, you need to be continuously 
diligent about non-routine cleaning so that it doesn’t pile up and become 
overwhelming.

266
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
As your inn becomes more popular and your occupancy goes up, you need to 
devote more time each day to cleaning because everything in your inn gets 
more use — from carpets and the furniture to doors and banisters. Bigger 
jobs don’t have to be done all at once. Some innkeepers do them room by 
room; others do them job by job or as they see the need. Fitting big jobs 
in when you can lets you set the schedule that works for your inn. Here’s 
a list of deep cleaning and maintenance tasks, along with general recommen-
dations for frequency (note, some of the frequency recommendations depend 
on occupancy):
 
✓ Wash windows and screens, as needed and depending on the weather 
(such as more often in the spring when rainstorms bring down pollen)
 
✓ Wash deck and outside areas, as needed
 
✓ Clean outdoor hot tub according to manufacturer’s instructions and 
health department regulations
 
✓ Paint touchups, as needed
 
✓ Repaint portions of the inn, annually
 
✓ Wash curtains, as needed or annually
 
✓ Vacuum thoroughly by moving all furniture, several times a year
 
✓ Flip and rotate mattresses to prolong life, every three months
 
✓ Wash comforter covers, every two months or as needed
 
✓ Wash pillow protectors, blankets, and mattress covers, every two 
months or as needed
 
✓ Wash shower curtains, every two months or as needed
 
✓ Clean carpets, annually
 
✓ Vacuum lampshades, every month
 
✓ Tighten hardware, every three months or as needed
 
✓ Clean glass on framed wall art and dust frames, every two weeks
 
✓ Clean fans and radiators, at least twice a year
 
✓ Clean baseboards, every few weeks or as needed
 
✓ Dust books on bookshelves, every few weeks
 
✓ Replace drawer liners, annually or as needed
 
✓ Clean appliance grease traps and filters (including the coils on or in your 
refrigerator or freezer if you have a commercial kitchen); follow manu-
facturers recommendations which are usually every three to six months 
for traps and filters and every six months for coils

 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
 
✓ Clean wood-burning fireplaces by scooping out ashes after every use 
(into a metal can with a lid because embers can stay hot for days) and 
then vacuuming ashes that are left; have a chimney sweep clean the 
chimney and check for safety issues annually
 
✓ Check and clean logs in gas fireplaces, approximately every five years
 
✓ Check fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, annually
 
✓ Test emergency lighting, at least twice a year
 
✓ Replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, at least 
twice a year
Buying Cleaning Equipment 
that Makes Your Job Easier
Cleaning and caring for your inn is hard work, so anything that can make 
your job easier is your friend. For cleaning and maintenance, you need 
strong, powerful equipment suitable for the job at hand, but when given a 
choice, choose the quieter model, because it’s often in use when guests 
are around.
Your wish list of tools and equipment to make your job easier may look 
something like this:
 
✓ Oversized washer: Generally, front-loading washers are preferred 
because they use less water. However, commercial front-loaders 
are more expensive and usually bigger than top-loaders. Talk with a 
commercial vendor in your area about your options.
 
✓ Oversized dryer: Linens take longer to dry than to wash, especially 
robes, blankets, and towels.
 
✓ Oversized dishwasher with sanitizing cycle: Most health departments 
require dishwashers to have a sanitizing cycle.
 
✓ Mangle (rotary iron) or steam press: Refer to the sidebar “Easing the 
task of ironing linens” for information on these appliances.
 
✓ Over-the-range exhaust hood: In non-commercial kitchens, this hood 
helps to keep grease from building up on kitchen walls and cabinetry.
 
✓ Vacuum cleaners: Each floor of your B&B should have its own light-
weight but powerful conventional vacuum so that you don’t have to 
haul one vacuum up and down stairs.

268
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
✓ Carpet cleaner: Having your own carpet cleaner is cheaper in the long 
run than hiring an outside service, and it allows you to shampoo carpets 
on your schedule.
 
✓ Backpack vacuum: This helper makes jobs where you need to maneuver 
with extra flexibility easier, such as cleaning stairs, crevices, tops of 
window frames, overhead lighting, and so on. Because it’s strapped to 
your back, you won’t need to worry about being tangled in the hose or 
bumping furniture like you would with a canister vacuum.
 
✓ Small hand-held sweeper: For a quick cleanup of a small area, a hand-
held carpet sweeper will save you the trouble of pulling out the big 
vacuum.
 
✓ Carpet spot cleaner: A small spot cleaner (such as the Bissell Little 
Green Carpet Cleaner) gets marks and stains off carpets and furnishing 
in between full carpet shampooing (which is usually an annual job).
 
✓ Heavy-duty (commercial) mop and bucket: These items reduce splash-
ing and are sturdier, which prevents tipping, and a sturdy mop will clean 
larger areas and hold up well when used frequently. Use this equipment 
to clean kitchen and basement floors.
 
Purchase maintenance contracts on important equipment such as your big-
ticket items like washers, dryers, and dishwashers (it’s usually not worth 
the expense on smaller, easily replaced equipment). Follow manufacturers’ 
instructions by performing recommended preventative maintenance, such as 
changing filters and routine cleaning, which saves you money, particularly on 
your furnace, air conditioning system, plumbing, and large appliances.
Caring for the Lawn and Garden
The outside of your inn is one area you can’t afford to neglect. The important 
thing is to present your guests with a neatly manicured lawn and garden and 
tidy, well-maintained outdoor spaces. In the B&B business, it’s called curb 
appeal. When guests arrive at your inn, you want their first impression to 
be “Ah, we chose the right inn. It looks so nice.” Your goal is to create an 
immediate reaffirmation of their choice to stay with you.
When you’re talking about work in the outdoor spaces of your bed & breakfast, 
cleaning and maintenance tasks blend together into overall caretaking. As with 
the indoor cleaning and maintenance tasks, however, some things should be 
done daily, like checking for trash that may have blown around, and other 
things need your attention less often, like trimming back landscaping.

269
 Chapter 13: Maintaining Your Inn
Taming landscaping
One of the quickest ways for your inn to look unkept is to have overgrown 
bushes, vines, and shrubs. In order to keep this foliage in check and to keep 
bushes trimmed and away from walkways, you need the right landscaping 
equipment.
Some of the landscaping equipment that you add to your wish list will 
depend on the size and layout of your property and, of course, your budget, 
but you can definitely start with some essentials. Make sure you have a lawn 
mower and edger (if you have lawns), as well as a shrub trimmer and a 
blower (if you have lots of walkways to keep clear of leaves). You also need 
the usual hand tools such as pruning shears, shovels, rakes, and brooms.
Clear your yard of hazards on which guests can trip or otherwise be injured. 
Watch out for ivy and vines on the ground in particular — they’re some of 
the easiest things to trip over when strolling outside. Keep ivy and other 
beautiful vines cut back and away from parking areas, steps, and walkways.
 
Landscaping maintenance is one big task that you may prefer to leave to 
the professionals, hiring a landscaping company to do the maintenance for 
you. Many innkeepers find that the time savings and the professional results 
outweigh the cost of hiring a professional lawn service.
Depending on the setup of your inn’s water supply, you may need to balance 
when your lawn and gardens are watered with when your guests are 
showering in order to ensure adequate water pressure for their showers. 
If you’re in the country and use well water, it may be possible to have the 
outdoor water source come from a well or irrigation source separate from 
the water inside your bed & breakfast.
 
If your inn has an automatic sprinkler system for the lawn and garden, be 
mindful of the time of day it comes on — you don’t want a guest to be 
drenched unexpectedly while out for a stroll! Set it to come on in the early 
morning, just before the sun and your guests rise (and want showers), or in 
the evening when most guests are not outside.
Tending to outdoor furniture
Rule #1 with outdoor furniture is to keep it clean. Wipe it down frequently, 
often in the morning and again in the afternoon, depending on your area. It’s 
a good idea to keep separate rags and brooms for cleaning outdoor furniture, 
decks, and patios than those that you use inside the inn because you’ll find 
that they get dirty quickly.

270
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
If you’re located in an area where outdoor furniture is used seasonally, 
consider storing it in a garage, shed, or other dry, protected place during 
the winter and rainy times of the year. Covering it with tarps and leaving it in 
the yard or on porches is unsightly and creates a bad impression of your inn. 
Remember, if something is off limits to guests, such as outdoor furniture 
during the off season, keep it out of reach and out of sight of guests.

Getting Help When You Need It
In This Chapter
▶ Finding the best person for the job
▶ Getting your hiring facts straight
▶ Dealing with the downside of being the boss
G
ood employees are invaluable assets. They’re the ambassadors of 
your business when their job is to interact with guests, and the back-
bone of a smooth-running inn when they’re doing maintenance and house-
keeping. Their performance helps to shape your guests’ experiences at your 
bed & breakfast. They also free up your time so that you can do other things.
But if you’ve never been a boss before, the nuances of interviewing and 
managing employees can be scary. This chapter lends a hand. In it I help 
you figure out what tasks are best to outsource, and I give you pointers on 
interviewing, training, and— when necessary — terminating your employees.
Knowing When You Need Help
In the beginning, few inns can afford the luxury of hiring outside help. 
However, at some point, when extra money becomes available, you’re likely 
to consider hiring additional staff to help improve your living situation — and 
maybe even take a vacation! There is no exact right time to hire help, but the 
following sections outline the times when you may need to consider it.
 
You can’t judge an inn by the number of people it employs. Some innkeepers 
choose to forgo paying themselves a salary in order to hire outside help. 
Each innkeeper has his own goals and makes personal lifestyle choices with 
tradeoffs between rewards and consequences.
Keeping up with day-to-day chores
If you’re running a small inn, you may need to take care of day-to-day jobs, 
maintenance, and general upkeep of your B&B for some time, but the time to 

272
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
plan for outside help is now! Anticipating when you can hire help should be 
part of your business plan (see Chapter 3). Your plan may call for reaching a 
set occupancy rate before hiring help, but you may not be able to afford to 
wait if you’re having trouble keeping up. For example, figure out a way to 
get extra help when the inn is not being cleaned up to your standards, you’re 
falling behind on your marketing, and, most importantly, before you become 
burned out.
Of course, if you’re running a larger inn or if you’re also working outside the 
B&B, hiring help may be necessary even before you begin welcoming guests. 
If so, then budgeting for help in your business plan is a must. Start a running 
list of tasks for the efficient operation of your inn. As you get ready to hire 
help, identify the jobs that can most easily be turned over to someone else, 
or that must be assigned to others. Start with the tasks that you physically 
won’t be able to do if you’re working outside of the inn and those that you 
like the least, and keep for yourself the ones that you can do best.
Using this list, create a job description. Is this a description for a house-
keeper, a cook, an assistant innkeeper, or a combination of several of these 
positions? Next, think about who would be the ideal candidate to fill the 
position — an aspiring innkeeper? A retiree? Someone looking for part-time 
work during the day? Your goal is to match your needs with the position 
first, and then, when you get to the hiring process, with the person.
During the high season
Many inns, especially those in popular tourist destinations, have a great 
need for extra help during high season, when you and all other hospitality 
businesses in the area are the busiest. During these times you will be 
competing with other local B&Bs, hotels, and restaurants for extra help. 
Therefore it’s a good idea to plan ahead, remembering that high season 
can be for an extended period of time or a holiday weekend. The busier you 
are, the more help you may need. Start early to look for help by asking for 
referrals from your staff and other innkeepers, deciding where you might run 
an ad, contacting local colleges, and so on.
 
If you have trouble hiring seasonal employees, take a tip from Alyce Mundy 
at Dunscroft By-The-Sea in Harwich Port, Massachusetts. Alyce has had 
success hiring foreign students on J1 Visas. Under the program, called “Work 
and Travel USA,” the students work for 4 months and travel 1 month. CIEE 
(Council on International Educational Exchange) is one of the sponsors (www.
ciee.org). The program has turned out to be a very economical way for 
many inns to find hard-working seasonal help who perform innkeeping duties 
from making beds to mowing lawns to cleaning pools at a reasonable cost.

273
 Chapter 14: Getting Help When You Need It
When you need to take time off
Being able to leave your B&B with the peace of mind that comes from 
knowing your business is in good hands can only happen if you plan ahead. 
If you don’t have staff in place that can run the inn efficiently, you need 
to find someone you trust to run the inn in your absence before the need 
arises. Then you need to get organized by documenting your procedures so 
that others can fill your shoes while you’re away.
Numerous professional interim innkeepers (also known as inn-sitters) make a 
full- or part-time career out of taking care of other people’s inns. Oftentimes, 
these folks are retired innkeepers themselves. The section “Handing over the 
whole enchilada: Hiring an interim innkeeper,” later in this chapter, explains 
what to look for when you hire an interim innkeeper.
Identifying Tasks to Outsource
When you get to the point where you need or can afford extra help, ask 
yourself these questions to determine what help you need:
 
✓ What can someone else do so that I can do what no one else can do? 
For many innkeepers this means giving up cleaning rooms, setting 
tables, doing laundry, or some combination of these tasks so they 
can focus on marketing, bookkeeping, and how their business is doing 
overall.
 
✓ What can someone else do better than I can? These could be tasks 
such as maintenance, repairs, or cooking. The best way to find good 
people is by asking other innkeepers and business owners in your area 
for recommendations. The portable Cheat Sheet at the front of this book 
provides a place for you to fill in important phone numbers and keep 
them at the ready.
 
✓ What is it that I hate to do? If you’re lucky, this list will include tasks on 
the previous two lists. For many innkeepers, these are tasks such as 
laundry and cleaning. Chances are, however, if it’s an undesirable job to 
you, it will be to others as well, so make sure you periodically do the job 
yourself to be sure it’s being completed to your desired satisfaction.
 
B&B guests choose a bed & breakfast inn for the personal attention they 
receive from the innkeeper, so don’t become an absentee innkeeper unless 
you outsource your job to an assistant innkeeper who’s available to interact 
with your guests and provide them with the same service that you would. 
Regardless, hiring out or outsourcing does not relieve you from supervising to 
be sure things are done correctly.

274
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Hiring Help at the Inn
Finding and training the right people is work — but the goal is to free up 
some of your work, so it should be worth it. Good inn owners know a secret. 
Hire people who interact well with guests, employees who have the ability 
and intuitiveness to provide a warm and caring atmosphere, so that guests 
are not always clamoring for your attention.
Finding good folks
Good employees can be hard to find. Here are some resources for finding 
people to fill your job openings:
 
✓ Ask for referrals from other innkeepers and small business owners. 
Use your networking skills and ask around. If you’re looking for part-
time help, you may be able to share someone already employed by 
another inn.
 
✓ Ask people who are employed in the same position you’re looking to 
fill (or ask other innkeepers to ask their employees for you). Good 
people often know good people. For example, your wonderful house-
keeper may have a sister or cousin who is looking for work.
 
✓ Contact local colleges and schools. Colleges, universities, and schools 
can be excellent sources of eager and competent staff. Check hospitality 
programs at colleges and universities for potential assistant innkeepers, 
and check culinary schools for help with food preparation.
 
✓ Check out relevant Web sites. Many employers and employees get 
connected online. The usefulness of a Web site is determined by the 
type of position you’re trying to fill. For instance, sites such as Craigslist 
(www.craigslist.com) are popular in larger metropolitan areas 
for advertising job postings for tasks such as housekeeping, cooking, 
and maintenance. Innkeeper forums are better resources for industry-
specific jobs such as recruiting assistant innkeepers and managers. 
(See Chapter 1 for help in finding an innkeeper forum.)
 
✓ Inquire at temporary agencies. These can be great resources, especially 
if the work is part-time or sporadic. Temp agencies can be a great 
last-minute option, especially for housekeepers. You can’t trust just 
anyone at your inn, so check references of the agencies ahead of time 
and find out what type of screening they do for the workers that they 
send to you.
 
✓ Peruse online directory job postings. Many online directories have 
postings of both positions available and people seeking employment. 
(See Chapter 8 for a listing of online bed & breakfast directories.)

275
 Chapter 14: Getting Help When You Need It
 
✓ Contact your state and/or local B&B associations and see whether 
they maintain a list of available help or postings for help wanted. 
The Professional Association of Innkeepers International maintains a 
classified section at www.paii.org. Click on Classifieds and then 
Innkeeping Careers to see postings.
Inheriting employees
You’re the new guy on the block and the current inn employees are as unsure 
about you as you are about them. They offer knowledge and expertise about 
how things at the inn work, and you offer the potential for future employ-
ment. If you have a training period with the previous owners (see Chapter 4), 
use this time to observe current inn employees. Watch how they do their 
jobs and interact with guests. You want to be on the lookout for things that 
may have been okay with the old innkeepers but are not okay with you, such 
as how rooms are made ready for arriving guests and so on.
You may want to notify all employees in writing that from the first day you 
take ownership, all staff and management will be placed on a 30-day “New 
Owner Introductory Period.” This provides a time for you and the employees 
to get acquainted with each other, and it allows you the opportunity to 
observe the work habits and job attitudes of the employees. It also gives you 
the advantage to decide which employees you will keep (some of whom may 
become your greatest asset), who you’ll need to coach, and who you’ll need 
to terminate. Remember, the inn is yours now, and even good employees will 
need to be trained in the way you want things done. See more information on 
training employees later in this chapter.
Interviewing potential employees
Interviewing and hiring the right employees takes a little bit of skill and a lot 
of luck. Hiring employees who come to you as referrals is ideal (though not 
always possible), and even these employees should go through the same 
interview process as those who come to you through other sources. Your 
objectives in the interview process are to make sure that you’re hiring the 
best person to get the job done, and to ensure that the person you ultimately 
hire knows what to expect and is prepared to do the job. In order to accom-
plish both of these goals, here are some things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Create a clear job description that includes the purpose of the job; skills, 
experience, and/or education required; job duties and responsibilities; 
physical demands; hours; and so on.

276
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
 
✓ Have the applicant fill out a job application. Anything that is important 
for you to know should be written on the application. The application 
is a legal document; a resume is not. One of the most important things 
you can discover from the application is previous employment history. 
Chances are if the person switches jobs every three months, you’ll 
quickly be looking for a new employee.
 
✓ Review the job description with the applicant and ask specific ques-
tions, using examples from the actual job. For instance, if you’re inter-
viewing for an assistant innkeeper, ask applicants how they would 
check in a guest. Their answers are not important in terms of accuracy 
(it’s impossible for them to know how you do it); rather, they give 
you a sense of the logic and reasoning with which they would approach 
the task. Ask yourself whether they’re using common sense and a 
customer-service-oriented approach to answer the question. This is 
what you’re looking for.
 
✓ Take applicants around the inn, showing them in detail the tasks their 
job would require. Ask them to give you examples of how they have 
performed similar tasks at other jobs. Ask them what they liked least 
about previous jobs. Let the applicants do a lot of the talking — you 
want to gather as much information as you can about them. If an 
applicant tells you all customers should be treated with respect, ask 
for examples of ways they’ve treated customers with respect in the 
past. This way you know that they’re not just telling you what they think 
you want to hear; rather, they intuitively understand the job.
 
Keep yourself out of legal hot water by knowing what questions you legally 
can and cannot ask in an interview. Asking personal questions about some-
one’s age, affiliations, disability, ethnic/national origin, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, race, religion, military record, and family or marital status is illegal. Be 
aware of gray areas. For example, while you can’t ask job candidates their 
nationality, you can ask, “Are you authorized to work in the United States?” 
You can’t ask about marital and family status, but if overtime may be part of 
the job, you can ask, “Would you be able and willing to work overtime?” If you 
have staff members help you interview potential candidates, make sure they, 
too, are aware of the personal, social, and medical information that’s illegal to 
ask about in a job interview.
You should get and check references prior to hiring anyone to help you at 
your inn, although they often don’t tell you a great deal. This is because 
people don’t like to speak unkindly about others or are concerned with 
the legal ramifications of doing so. At the very least, verify the dates of 
employment that the applicant has given you and ask whether the applicant 
would be eligible for rehire. Many inns also do a background check before 
making an official offer of employment. You must obtain the employee’s 
permission before conducting a background check. A background check 
verifies previous employment and criminal records by jurisdiction.

277
 Chapter 14: Getting Help When You Need It
Deciding what to pay
Deciding what to pay is always tricky. Asking other innkeepers for the ranges 
they pay for similar positions and looking at ads from larger hotels can help 
you establish a range to use as a guideline.
 
The people you’re interviewing usually are considering not only a job at a 
B&B, but also one in the lodging industry in general. So your wages must be 
competitive, not only in salary but also in terms of benefits. Employees usually 
don’t take a job based on salary alone. You can entice employees with benefits 
such as living in, free meals, various forms of insurance, incentive or bonus 
programs, discounts, flexible work hours, and so on. You should consult 
with your CPA, accountant, or tax advisor to determine whether the value of 
any of the benefits you offer your employees must be included as income for 
the employee.
Independent contractors versus employees
Many innkeepers are confused and intimidated 
by trying to figure out the difference between 
employees and independent contractors. It’s 
important for you to correctly classify the people 
who work for you so that the appropriate income 
is reported to the IRS. In a nutshell, it boils down 
to answering the following simple questions:
 ✓ Who dictates how the work is to be done?
 ✓ Who sets the hours and the days of the 
week to work?
 ✓ Who sets the rate of pay?
 ✓ Who provides the materials and equipment 
to perform the tasks?
If the answer to the preceding questions is you, 
then the person doing work for you is an 
employee and you are the employer. You must 
obtain an employer ID number from the IRS and 
from your state. You deduct the appropriate 
payroll withholdings from each payroll check 
that you give your employee based upon the 
information they provide in the W-4 form. As an 
employer, you also provide on-the-job (workers 
compensation) insurance and W-2s at year-end 
showing the total wages your employees 
received. It makes no difference how much or 
how little your employees earn; how few or how 
many hours they work; whether they’re tempo-
rary, seasonal, on-call, part-time, or full-time; or 
even if they last only one day on the job! They 
are your employees.
If, on the other hand, the answer to the ques-
tions in the preceding list is “the people doing 
the job,” those people are most likely indepen-
dent contractors. You provide a W-9 to them to 
be completed and returned to you so that you 
have their name, their company name (if any), 
and their social security number or other tax ID 
number. You provide independent contractors a 
1099-Misc at year-end showing the total amount 
you paid to them in the previous year if you paid 
them more than $600 during the year and they 
are not registered as a corporation.
If you’re unsure, the best resources to consult 
are IRS Publications 15 and 15-A. To find these 
publications, visit the IRS Web site (www.irs.
gov) and enter 15 or 15-A in the search box.

278
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
The amount you must pay your employees varies by state. The federal 
government sets a minimum hourly wage, plus many states have their own 
minimum-wage laws. Nonexempt employees, or employees that are usually 
nonprofessional employees who are paid hourly, must be paid whichever 
rate is higher. The Department of Labor’s Web site (www.wagehour.dol.
gov) contains a wealth of information, including minimum-wage exceptions, 
information on overtime pay, and state minimum-wage requirements.
 
Payroll taxes and costs are a part of doing business. Doing payroll is simply 
another skill you need to acquire. Most bookkeeping software can easily run 
payroll for you, along with figuring all the taxes. Your CPA or accountant 
can easily help you set up a system to do payroll on your own or using your 
bookkeeping software.
 
Don’t pay employees in cash “under the table.” First, it’s illegal, and second, it 
skews your financial statement, which will only hurt you in a future sale of the 
business.
Training your employees
Your employees are an extension of your business, and training them is an 
investment in your business. Your employees should be trained to handle 
any and all guest requests and situations, clean every room, prepare every 
breakfast, answer every call, and/or make every repair, depending on their 
job description and whatever cross-training you decide to provide. The 
end result of their efforts should reflect the quality and service you want 
your B&B to deliver. The point is that each employee’s actions are a direct 
reflection on your B&B and you as the innkeeper. This makes it your respon-
sibility to be sure that they know what to do in all situations, and that they 
follow through.
Setting standards and sticking to them
Being a manager of others is often a hard job for an innkeeper. Innkeepers, 
by nature, are overachievers and oftentimes very independent. Sometimes 
those with this type of personality have trouble delegating and find them-
selves thinking, “I can do it better (or faster) myself.” Even people who previ-
ously held jobs in the corporate world that included supervising others 
find the transition to managing inn employees difficult because of their 
direct and deep personal ownership of the B&B and the guest experience. 
Don’t sabotage the success of your team by being overly controlling. Teach 
employees how things should be done and then give them the flexibility and 
freedom to get the job done. When things are not done to your satisfaction, 
coach, teach, and lead by example rather than dictating corrections.
To get the help you need, your employees need to know what you expect. 
Because your B&B is a small business, your employees may need to be 
cross-trained. Organization is key. The procedures for nearly everything you 

279
 Chapter 14: Getting Help When You Need It
do in the running of your inn should be documented. Keeping this informa-
tion current makes it easy to set expectations for employees. (You’ll also be 
ready when you need to leave the inn in the care of an interim innkeeper.)
As you go through the chapters of this book, use the lists you create to build 
a manual for your bed & breakfast. Use the daily housekeeping schedule 
you create in Chapter 13 to train housekeeping staff. These employees need 
not only a schedule and a checklist, but they also need to know your policies 
regarding such matters as the number of towels or bottles of shampoo to 
place in each room. Make sure anyone who answers the phone or takes 
reservations is familiar with the etiquette that you establish for your inn 
(see Chapter 11). Those who interact with your guests should also know 
your policies (see Chapter 7), which should be explicitly expressed in the 
manual. Your manual should also include guest check-in procedures and 
phone numbers to use in an emergency (see Chapter 12). These lists and 
procedures — and the resulting manual — reflect the standards you set for 
the running of your B&B.
Even that which seems obvious to you may not be obvious to others when 
it comes to how you want something done. Employees need and deserve 
training. Here are some other things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Review your employees’ job descriptions with them and give them a 
copy so they can refer to it.
 
 Including every conceivable task in a job description is difficult, so it’s 
a good idea to include wording such as the following at the end of the 
description: This description is intended to illustrate the kinds of tasks and 
levels of work difficulty required for the position and does not necessarily 
include all the related, specific duties and responsibilities of the position. It 
does not limit the assignment of related duties not mentioned.
 
✓ You’ll have the best results if you’re the one to initially train new 
employees. This helps them understand the importance of their job and 
your expectations.
 
✓ Manage by walking around. Be present, and let employees know you’re 
checking their work.
 
✓ Be clear on policies and perks. Employees won’t know if they’re over-
stepping their bounds unless you clearly define what is okay and what 
isn’t. As an example, helping themselves to extra shampoo and soaps is 
probably not okay and should be clearly communicated.
 
✓ Use performance reviews as a way of coaching. Set predetermined 
times to review employee performance. Schedule annual or semi-annual 
reviews during your slow periods.
Teaching customer service as a way of thinking
Good customer service is something you need to teach employees to incor-
porate as a way of thinking. Having a yes mentality is a good way to start. This 

280
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
means taking every question or request a guest asks and beginning the 
answer with what you can do as opposed to what you can’t. For example, 
when guests ask for an early check-in, you can tell them, “We can store your 
bags for you and recommend a local restaurant for lunch because your room 
won’t be ready until 3 p.m.” rather than “No, you can’t check in early.”
Helping employees understand the difference between a bed & breakfast stay 
and a traditional hotel stay is another key to customer-service training. The 
importance of good customer service cannot be underestimated in providing 
a quality bed & breakfast experience (see Chapter 12).
Handing over the whole enchilada: 
Hiring an interim innkeeper
Interim innkeepers, or inn-sitters, are individuals you can hire to run your 
inn in your absence. They’re familiar with how to run a B&B. Many have been 
innkeepers themselves, whereas others have been trained to be professional 
interim innkeepers. When you hire an interim innkeeper, the most important 
thing is to be sure you’re leaving the inn in good, capable hands.
Finding an interim innkeeper
Several resources are available to help you find someone capable of filling 
your shoes. Consider the following:
 
✓ Check with your state B&B association for a list of interim innkeepers.
 
✓ Visit the Web site of the Professional Association of Innkeepers 
International at www.paii.org for a listing of interim innkeepers. From 
the home page, click on Vendor Marketplace under the Resources tab, 
and then click on Interim Innkeeper.
 
✓ Contact the Interim Innkeepers Network (www.interiminnkeepers.
net) and search for member interim innkeepers by state or availability.
Figuring out what to pay an interim innkeeper
Interim innkeepers set their rates individually. Talk to prospective interim 
innkeepers about your inn and the job functions you want them to perform in 
your absence. Most interim innkeepers have a base rate and negotiate the 
daily rate from there, depending on a number of variables such as the size of 
your inn, whether you have a housekeeping staff or expect them to clean the 
rooms, your occupancy rate, and so on.
Negotiating a rate isn’t an exact science. To get in the ballpark, you may 
want to ask other innkeepers what they typically pay. Then, by working with 
a professional interim innkeeper who understands what the job entails, you 
can arrive at a price that you’re happy with.

281
 Chapter 14: Getting Help When You Need It
Covering all your bases
Make sure you have a complete checklist of everything relating to your inn, 
procedures, guests, and vendors. Your interim innkeeper shouldn’t have to 
search for passwords to access your availability information, or waste time 
hunting for someone to call if the plumbing springs a leak. Interim innkeepers 
should have everything they need at their fingertips in order to run your inn 
smoothly in your absence.
 
Many innkeepers want to meet their interim innkeeper ahead of time. You can 
ask the person you choose to come and work with you for a few days before 
taking over the inn.
Taxes and insurance are additional items you need to consider, and possibly 
deal with.
 
✓ Taxes: When you hire an interim innkeeper, you need to find out 
whether that person is an independent contractor or a corporation, an 
LLC, or a partnership with a Federal Tax Identification Number (FTIN). 
If the interim innkeeper is incorporated, you only need to pay the bill, 
but if he is an independent contractor or an unincorporated partnership, 
you also need to prepare a 1099 for that person for tax purposes. (See 
additional information on independent contractors in the sidebar, 
“Independent contractors versus employees.”)
 
✓ Insurance: Many interim innkeepers carry their own insurance. If this 
is the case with your interim innkeeper, you should be named as an 
additional insured. Choosing an interim innkeeper who has his own 
insurance is recommended; however, if the interim innkeeper you 
choose doesn’t have insurance, you may be liable for workers comp 
and possibly unemployment. Check with your insurance carrier to see 
whether you need to do anything to be sure you and your business are 
adequately covered in your absence.
 
As with any business dealings, always spell out all the details of your arrange-
ment with your interim innkeeper in a written contract.
Terminating Employees
Bad hires can ruin your business. The actions of every employee are a 
reflection on you. Guests don’t care whether a problem lies with you or an 
employee; they only care about the experience they have at your inn. 
When an employee is creating a negative impact on your guests, you have 
no choice but to address it, and, if attempts to rectify the problem fail, to let 
the employee go.

282
Part IV: Up and Running: Day-to-Day Operations 
Your best bet in dealing with difficult employees is to take steps to nip the 
problem in the bud. At the first indication of a problem, you should verbalize 
your concern with accurate information and examples. Discuss the problem 
with the employee, and clearly state the actions required to improve and 
keep the position. Document the conversation in the employee’s file.
In the following days or weeks, continue to document, document, document, 
and be clear about your expectations. If termination is the outcome, you 
want to have a strong case for the reasoning behind your decision in case the 
employee decides to contest it.
Review the employee’s progress, and terminate the employee if progress is 
not made.
 
Innkeepers are notorious for keeping less than satisfactory employees far past 
their “expiration dates.” As a people-oriented person, you hate to give up on 
someone, but the overall harm to your business needs to take precedence.
If you take steps to get an employee on track and she doesn’t improve, either 
that person isn’t capable of improving or, more likely, doesn’t want to. Often 
an employee in this situation develops a bad attitude, which may be conta-
gious to other employees and bring down the morale of your team.
If you let the problem go on, guests aren’t the only ones who will suffer: 
Other employees will think it’s unfair for one person to get away with not 
having to do her job. If this isn’t enough motivation to encourage you to deal 
quickly and seriously with employee performance issues, think about the 
instantaneous and permanent mark a bad online guest review leaves against 
your inn. You’re paying someone to do a job and the guest is paying for an 
experience — neither should be negotiable.

Part V
Taking It beyond 
Breakfast and the Basics

In this part . . .
Your inn is always developing and maturing. Just 
because your business is up and running doesn’t 
mean that you don’t need help and support, or that you 
don’t have questions. If you want to continue to grow 
your business (and I hope you do!), this part helps you do 
so by discussing taking your marketing to the next level, 
expanding your current inn, or even buying another. I also 
encourage you to take care of yourself both personally 
and professionally to keep you going as an innkeeper — 
and a good one at that — with suggestions to avoid burn-
out. Then, in anticipation of when it’s time to move on, I 
help you to determine the best time to sell your inn and 
what you need to know when you’re ready for that step.

and Building on It

▶ Making sure your guests are happy
▶ Evaluating your advertising choices
▶ Getting an overview of social networking
W
hen someone asks you how your inn is doing, do you have an answer 
for them? Do you know? Equally as important as staying on top of 
bookkeeping and cleaning bathrooms, you need to take time periodically to 
analyze your successes and, yes, your disappointments. Just when you think 
you’re ready to wind down after a busy season, you need to gear up and 
decide how you can take your business to the next level.
This chapter helps you to take a good hard look at where your business is 
and where you want it to go. I encourage you to compare your results to your 
projections and then figure out how you can use this information to make 
your business more successful. As an innkeeper, you’re fortunate to have 
many advertising choices, but these choices are confusing, so I show you 
how to determine which advertising is working. I also introduce you to adver-
tising and marketing strategies beyond the basics.
Analyzing Your B&B’s Performance
If you didn’t create a business plan before starting your bed & breakfast, it’s 
not too late. A business plan is a road map for your business, and if you’ve 
been running your bed & breakfast without a clear direction, now is the time 
to chart the course (see Chapter 3 information on creating a business plan). 

286
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
If you’ve already created a business plan, then you know it’s a work in prog-
ress that’s bound to change as your business grows and develops. Get it out, 
dust it off, and take a look at how you’re doing.
Comparing results to expectations
You’re probably wondering whether you’re on target to meet the goals that 
you set. Are you meeting or exceeding your occupancy projections? How 
about your revenue and expense projections? Using your accounting soft-
ware, you can run simple reports to see where your business stands, and you 
can compare these reports against the projections and expectations that you 
set. If you keep your records by hand you can and should create these same 
reports manually or in a spreadsheet.
To get this information, create a P&L (profit and loss statement). Set the 
date range for the period that you want to analyze. Then compare your total 
revenues, total expenses, and net income (or loss) with what you had antici-
pated in your business plan. If you’re ahead of expectations, congratulations! 
If you’re behind, don’t worry — this chapter gives you many ideas to boost 
your results in the coming year.
You can run similar reports to analyze your occupancy rates in comparison to 
your projections by using your property management software (see Chapter 
6 for information on property management systems), or conduct your own 
analysis using your records and ledgers. Looking at your occupancy by month 
enables you to quickly spot times of lower occupancy so that in the coming 
year, you can ratchet up your marketing in anticipation of these periods.
Tracking trends and the unexpected
Unexpected results can be good or bad news, and both provide important 
information on how to grow your business. During periods (or in areas) where 
your overall results are better or worse than you expected, your natural ques-
tion should be “Why?” Perhaps you over- or underestimated these figures when 
setting your projections. That’s fine, because now you have some hard num-
bers to use for the future. More than likely, you’ll find both good and bad news 
in comparing actual figures with the projections you initially set. Look at the 
better-than-expected results and see if you can identify any patterns, such as:
 
✓ Do you have a particular room that has a higher occupancy than your 
other rooms? If so, ask yourself why. Do you have better pictures of this 
room on your Web site? Is the price lower in comparison to your other 
rooms or similar rooms at other B&Bs? Is this your favorite room or the 

287
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
room that you perceive to be the best? With this information, ask your-
self whether you can make changes to your other rooms, or the percep-
tion of your other rooms, that would increase their occupancy rate.
 
✓ Can you attribute the periods during which you exceeded your occu-
pancy projections to anything in particular? For example, did a local 
corporation book numerous rooms with you? If this is the case, don’t 
rest on your laurels — be proactive. Contact the corporation to find out 
whether they need rooms annually or on a regular basis and, if so, offer 
to make those reservations now.
 
✓ Do you see a pattern in the reasons guests visited you? If you find you 
have a large number of honeymooners visiting, are you keeping track of 
their anniversaries? Do you have a system to send anniversary greetings 
letting them know you hope to see them back at the inn to celebrate the 
occasion? Include an enticing special offer or an incentive like a special 
gift to welcome them back.
 
Crunching numbers is great; however, knowing why guests have chosen your 
inn or area can help you to attract similar new guests. You won’t know this 
information if you don’t ask, and you can’t track it and analyze it if you don’t 
record it. Many property management software systems can do this for you, 
or you can create your own records using an Excel spreadsheet.
If your results are below the projections that you set, look back over the year 
and see if weather or economic factors existed that could have had an effect 
on your income and occupancy. Maybe you cut back on advertising during 
that particular period, or maybe you did nothing different and similar proper-
ties also experienced the same general decline in occupancy. No matter what 
conclusions you draw, you can use this information to be proactive for the 
same season next year or in case you experience similar conditions again. 
(See the section “Creating packages: Bundling services that sell” later in this 
chapter for info on using packages to boost low occupancy.)
Adjusting expenses to increase profits
The benefit of being familiar with your bills, expenses, and projections is 
that you know where your money is going. That makes it easier to figure 
out which expenses you can control. Some ideas for cutting back on your 
expenses include
 
✓ Serving a plated breakfast rather than a buffet. A plated breakfast 
results in less waste and more portion control, so you can decrease food 
costs by making this switch.
 
✓ Limiting dryer time. It’s easy to throw a load of linens into the dryer 
and set the timer for an hour when, in fact, the linens will be dry in half 
that time. Remove them promptly to cut down on ironing, which also 
saves time and electricity.

288
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
✓ Performing routine maintenance and making repairs promptly. A 
well-maintained inn does more than make a good impression on guests. 
It also keeps appliances in good working order and extends their useful 
life. Fixing leaks and adding insulation as needed saves on utility costs.
 
✓ Storing individual serving sizes. Keeping individual serving sizes of 
food items that you periodically get requests for — say, individual cans 
of V8 — allows you to accommodate the occasional guest who wants it 
without having to throw out a large, unused container if no other guest 
requests it for a week. This lets you cut down on waste without cutting 
down on service.
 
✓ Cutting down on serving sizes. Look at what guests leave on their 
plates. Reduce the serving size of items that you find many guests aren’t 
eating, whether it’s that extra sausage or those breakfast potatoes.
 
If guests are leaving items on their plates, it doesn’t necessarily mean your 
serving size is too large. It could also mean they don’t like the item or the 
item’s quality. To serve the best breakfast possible, replace items on your 
menus that are frequently left on guests’ plates. Lack of quality at your B&B 
costs you even more than you can save by cutting expenses.
Yield management
Most large chain hotels — and the travel indus-
try in general — use a rate factoring technique 
called yield management. Yield management 
(also known as revenue management) simply 
means that you raise and lower the prices of 
your rooms based on supply and demand. For 
example, if you’re located in a college town, 
yield management suggests that you should 
raise your rates when special events occur, 
such as moving in or out days, parents’ visit-
ing weekend, graduation, football weekends, 
and so forth, when you know demand for your 
rooms will be high. Yield management also 
suggests that if you have four rooms and three 
have been rented for a particular weekend, you 
should raise the price on the fourth room. The 
idea here is that when you know that demand 
for your rooms will be greater than availability, 
you should charge more for them.
Yield management is also used during periods 
of low occupancy, such that you lower your 
prices during periods of less demand or on 
unsold rooms as the check-in date gets closer. 
The logic is that getting a lower rate for the 
room is better than getting nothing at all if the 
room sits empty.
However, yield management isn’t for every-
one, nor is it the only way to look at pricing. 
For example, in the case of the college events 
noted above, you might use a different logic 
and rationalize that the guests who come on 
those special weekends will return every year 
that their children are in school (not to mention 
that their kids may return as alumni) and, in the 
interest of rewarding their patronage, you may 
decide you don’t want to charge your repeat 
guests more.
You may even decide that having many differ-
ent rates is just too complicated, and therefore 
leave your rates unchanged despite increased 
demand.

289
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
Setting next year’s projections
Setting your projections for year two and beyond is done in much the same 
way as your initial projections (for a review, see Chapter 3). Unless you have 
a crystal ball, guesswork will still be a big part of your projections, but after 
the first year, you have the benefit of knowing
 
✓ Occupancy: You now have real historical data to factor in.
 
✓ Advertising performance: Advertising takes awhile to take effect. In the 
beginning, every idea presented to you may sound like a great opportu-
nity but after being open for a year or two, you find it easier to see
 
• The types of advertising that work for you (print or online ads, 
association referrals, or a combination of various categories)
 
• Which companies or campaigns within these categories are pro-
ducing results (later in this chapter I help you determine which 
advertising is effective).
 
 What works changes over time, so continuously review your advertising 
results.
 
✓ Revenues and expenses: Budgets are educated guesses or projections of 
your revenues and expenses. Enter your estimates in the budgeting com-
ponent of your accounting software and run comparisons to previous 
time periods.
 
✓ Referral and repeat guest rate: Are you getting referrals and repeat 
guests? If so, you’re on the road to success! You can expect this effect to 
mushroom and produce good results going forward.
 
Guest rooms are a perishable commodity! Each night they’re not rented is an 
opportunity lost.
Evaluating Guest Satisfaction
Guest satisfaction is an important measure of your success. After all, any 
business without satisfied customers won’t be in business for long, and this 
is especially true in the bed & breakfast industry. Measuring successes and 
deficiencies are a part of doing business. Larger businesses require huge 
budgets to measure customer satisfaction but, luckily for you, finding out 
what your guests think is relatively easy. Not only can their feedback help 
to make you a better host or hostess for future guests, but if used properly, 
it can also be a powerful marketing tool. (See Chapter 8 for some great 
information on how to solicit guest feedback and use it as a marketing tool.)

290
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Use guest satisfaction feedback to help you understand the following:
 
✓ Are your guests who you think they are? Reading any and all guest 
comments that are posted online and listening carefully to those com-
municated directly to you tells you whether your guests are who you 
think they are and whether you’re providing the services and amenities 
they want. Watch for key phrases like
 
• I would have liked to have seen. . . .
 
• I thought the innkeeper would. . . .
 
• The description on the Web site was not accurate.
 
 This information provides you with invaluable free training on how to be 
a better innkeeper, while improving your guests’ experiences and, in the 
process, increasing your repeat and referral business.
 
✓ What are you doing wrong? No one likes criticism, but all negative com-
ments should be viewed as valuable feedback. If you receive a similar 
complaint from more than one guest, you’re doing something wrong. 
Most likely, what the guests are expecting is not in sync with what 
you’re offering. This means you are failing to adequately communicate 
what a stay at your inn is like. Reevaluate all your communications with 
your guests, including your reservation system, your Web site, e-mail 
communications, confirmations, policies, and brochures, and change 
anything that is misleading or spell it out more clearly so that guests 
know what to expect.
 
Oftentimes, innkeepers feel that negative guest reviews are either untrue or 
very unfair. You work hard trying to please your guests, and negative com-
ments hurt, especially when they’re posted online for the world to see. Do 
yourself and your reputation a favor and let your anger subside before you 
post a management response. Don’t take criticism personally, and think before 
you write. I know — easier said than done — but otherwise you may regret it. 
Once you post something online, it’s a permanent record that can be seen by 
any and all potential guests and referrals.
Taking Your Online Marketing 
to the Next Level
The many facets of marketing your bed & breakfast can be overwhelming 
when you’re first starting out (see Chapter 8). It’s a lot to absorb, but remem-
ber that it’s a work in progress. The most successful innkeepers are those 
who have the following characteristics in common:

291
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
 
✓ They never stop learning.
 
✓ They continually delve deeper into more targeted and sophisticated 
advertising techniques.
 
✓ They’re always open to new ideas.
 
✓ They drop anything that isn’t working.
If your bed & breakfast is like most, the majority of your new business will 
come from the Internet. Enhancing your online marketing is the fastest and 
most cost effective way for most inns to improve occupancy rates. You owe 
it to yourself and the success of your B&B to know as much as you can about 
online marketing.
 
Being part of an inspected and approved program is a successful marketing 
strategy that brings additional business to many inns. Once established, you 
can apply for membership in organizations such as Select Registry or Canada 
Select that require inspections and/or acceptance. Many state associations 
also require that inns admitted for membership be rigorously inspected and 
approved.
Adding pay-per-click advertising
Pay-per-click is a form of online advertising whereby you only pay when a 
guest clicks on your advertisement. Pay-per-click ads are usually displayed 
on the top pages of Web sites and along the side pages of popular search 
engines like Google, where they’re generally identified as “Sponsored 
Results.” Pay-per-click ads involve an investment of your time to set up and 
maintain. Then to get them to work efficiently, you must devote some time 
each month to reviewing the results and making appropriate adjustments.
The concept is based on search terms, which are the words or phrases people 
are most likely to enter into search engines to find you. When you do pay-per-
click advertising, you decide on the search terms or phrases that will best 
find you. Then through a process known as bidding, because you have to be 
willing to pay more than other inns in order to be displayed, you set the max-
imum price that you’re willing to pay if a guest clicks on your advertisement. 
Be aware, though, that if your price isn’t high enough, or if other inns are will-
ing to pay more for the same term, or if your ad fails to attract enough clicks, 
the search engine company will drop you for that search term or phrase.
To get started, you simply create an account, choose your search terms, 
set the price you’re willing to pay for each click, and write a description for 
your ad. For best results, pick targeted terms and write a custom description 
so that only truly interested guests will click on your ad, and you won’t be 
paying for clicks from uninterested people.

292
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Making pay-per-click work for you
The advantage of pay-per-click advertising is that it’s a way to get your inn 
to display in the top results of the search engines. If guests click on your 
ad, they’re taken directly to your Web site rather than to a directory, where 
they’d also see information about other inns in your area. The idea behind 
making pay-per-click work for you is to pinpoint the search term that gives 
you the greatest number of clicks for the smallest price. The more popular 
the search term, the more each click costs.
Take, for example, the key phrase “Cape May New Jersey.” This is a very pop-
ular search term; therefore, the cost per click is quite high. Furthermore, the 
term is too general — it’s unlikely that a large number of people who search 
just for “Cape May New Jersey” are actually looking for a bed & breakfast. 
Bidding on more targeted search terms not only costs less, but also produces 
better results. Because Cape May is such a competitive town for bed & break-
fasts, even the term “Cape May Bed & Breakfast” is very expensive, although 
it is highly targeted. The term “Cape May New Jersey B&B” is less expensive, 
yet still produces results.
Finding companies that offer pay-per-click
Numerous companies provide pay-per-click advertising. They have different 
interfaces, but once you understand the concept, they’re all fairly straightfor-
ward and easy to use. Popular pay-per-click adverting companies include
 
✓ Google AdWords: www.adwords.google.com
 
✓ Yahoo! Search Marketing: http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com
 
✓ Microsoft adCenter: https://.adcenter.microsoft.com
 
Create one list of terms and phrases in a format such as Excel and use it for 
each company that you create an account with. When you compile your list, 
think of anything and everything a guest might type in to find your inn. When 
you set up your account, you’re given access to tools that suggest search 
terms and phrases for you. Pay attention to these — they’re based on what 
guests are actually searching for. As an aside, the terms you bid on should be 
included in your Web site content as well.
Tracking pay-per-click
Within your pay-per-click account, you can keep track of how often poten-
tial guests are clicking on your advertisements and which terms are pro-
viding the best return. You can set a daily or monthly budget and even 
designate what time of the day you want your ads to appear. This enables 
you to create and stick to a budget, and spread out the running of your ads 
over a period of time.

293
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
Software programs are available that track not only the performance of 
your pay-per-click ad campaigns, but also the activity on your Web site and 
all your advertising efforts. They offer various levels of detail. You can ask 
whoever helps you set up your Web site to help you install tracking software 
(also known as a traffic report or Web analytics), too.
Another alternative is to have someone else manage the tracking and 
analysis for you. Companies like Acorn Internet Services (www.acorn-is.
com), InnsideOut Solutions (www.savvyinnkeeper.com), and White Stone 
Marketing (www.whitestonemarketing.com) specialize in helping inn-
keepers manage and evaluate this type of advertising.
Getting optimal search engine placement
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) consists of the efforts you undertake to get 
your Web site to place higher among the organic (free) listings on a search 
engine. Figuring out the algorithms currently being used by the search 
engines to rank sites requires a great deal of time and attention (not to men-
tion the algorithms change frequently), so it’s usually better to hire someone 
to do it for you. If you do want to attempt this yourself, the best advice I can 
give you is to pay attention to what search engines like in terms of keywords, 
content, and links (all of which I discuss in the upcoming sections), and then 
institute only those strategies that make sense.
 
Don’t try and trick the search engines. If search engines think you’re doing 
something to purposely manipulate your Web site into achieving a higher 
placement, they’ll usually penalize your site by listing it lower or, in extreme 
cases, black-listing your site so that it disappears from the free listings alto-
gether. When you make changes to your Web site with the purpose of improv-
ing your search engine placement, make those changes gradually.
 
Beware of companies that promise or guarantee placement on the search 
engines and those that want to submit your site to multiple search engines at 
once. Good search engine placement is a science that takes hard work. The 
process should be tailored to your inn and your area and, as such, isn’t some-
thing that can be done in one shot. (See Chapter 8 for Web site designers who 
specialize in the bed & breakfast industry and in SEO.)
Key search words are key
One thing that has remained a constant in the evolution of SEO is the use of 
keywords.
 
✓ Periodically review and update the verbiage on your Web site to make 
sure you’re using the most up-to-date keywords as you get to know 
your guests and what they’re searching for. Be sure this information is 
prominently displayed on your Web site. Not only is this important info 

294
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
that your site visitors need to know, but it also adds popular keywords 
to your text. This makes new guests more likely to find your B&B when 
searching on the Internet.
 
✓ Keep the content of your Web site fresh. Search engines pay attention 
to how often a site changes, so continually update your Web site text 
with seasonal activities and fresh content. This not only keeps your 
site current and appealing to guests, but also helps your search engine 
placement.
 
To get on the right track, think of the text on your Web site as talking to your 
potential guests by providing them with important information, and talking to 
the search engines by incorporating your keywords into your text. You’ll 
reward both guests and the search engines by having a robust Web site with a 
lot of content.
Building links is like building a neighborhood
Search engines display Web sites based on the algorithms that humans 
create. One currently important factor used to determine a site’s placement 
is the number of links, or paths to and from other Web sites. Links can be 
either bad or good. Check out the following explanations and examples:
 
✓ Incoming links: The more good-quality Web sites that link to your Web 
site, the better your Web site is deemed to be. This makes it important 
for you to get as many top-notch sites as possible to link to you, espe-
cially ones that are within the same industry. For example, a link from 
your state bed & breakfast association is much more valuable than a link 
from a company that makes cat food. The logic is that if a lot of major 
hospitality or travel sites are linking to you, your site must be valuable 
because people, not computers, add those links.
 
✓ Keyword-rich links: Links to your Web site are even more valuable if 
the words that make up the link are keyword-rich. For example, a link 
to your Web site that reads “Cape May, New Jersey Bed & Breakfast” 
is viewed much more favorably by the search engines than a link that 
reads simply “click here.” Keyword-rich text appears more natural to the 
search engines and lends credibility to your site.
 
✓ Outbound links: Linking to other Web sites is fine, but having too many 
outbound links dilutes the ranking of pages on your site. Limit the place-
ment of outbound links on your Web site to those that provide valuable 
resources to your guests, such as links to activities and restaurants.
 
Use caution when gathering links. Too many that don’t make sense can actu-
ally hurt you. Because some site owners have abused this technique in the 
past, the search engine algorithms are now designed to flag sites with a lot of 
inbound or outbound links. Stick with partnerships and link exchanges that 
relate to your business or provide information and resources to guests, and 
don’t add too many at once.

 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
Tracking your Web site traffic
Research shows that your average guest will visit your Web site several times 
before deciding to make a reservation. In other words, the guest rarely comes 
to your Web site from one source and makes a reservation or reservation 
request on the first visit. So how can you track where guests are finding you?
Web hosting companies provide traffic reports, which are summaries of the 
activity on your Web site that give you invaluable information about your 
guests before you even meet them. Reading these reports clues you in to 
how guests are finding your B&B. With this info, you can focus your energy 
and resources in similar places to attract more of the same guests. This data 
can help you figure out which online advertising is working and worth your 
investment and which should be dropped. Traffic reports also can tell you 
about your guests’ behaviors when they’re on your Web site and whether 
they’re interested in what they see.
Traffic reports come in two speeds:
 
✓ Basic traffic reports tell you which advertising is sending guests (traffic) 
to your Web site, but they don’t tell you which guests make reserva-
tions. In this case, it’s important to look at quality as well as quantity. 
Don’t just look at the number of referrals a site sends you. Determining 
how interested those guests are is more important, and you can tell this 
by checking out how many pages on your Web site guests look at and 
how long they stay on your site.
Ogling Google Analytics
Even if your hosting company provides you with 
traffic statistics, it’s hard to beat the features 
of Google Analytics (www.google.com/
analytics). It’s free, comprehensive, and 
robust.
Google Analytics tracks and records the activ-
ity on your Web site through a simple piece of 
code that your Webmaster adds to each page 
on your site. To view this information, you log in 
to your Google account. Each report contains 
a lot of information, so interpreting it all can be 
overwhelming. However, the information is so 
valuable that it’s worth working with one of the 
hosting companies that’s familiar with the bed 
& breakfast industry to decipher it. (See Chapter 
8 for a list of Web site hosting companies that 
specialize in the bed & breakfast industry.)
Google has numerous other free tools that you 
or your Webmaster should become familiar with 
as well. For example, after you create a Google 
account, be sure your information is correct on 
Google maps so that your inn comes up in the 
local search results on Google.

296
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
✓ Souped-up traffic reports distinguish the bookers from the lookers and 
report all the sources that the guest looked at for each actual guest 
reservation. Services such as Intell-a-Keeper (www.acorn-is.com) and 
SuperStatZ (www.ew3d.com) provide more advanced tracking software.
 
Do not place tracking software (often free) that is not password-protected on 
your Web site. If you do, your competition will be able to see your informa-
tion, which gives them a competitive advantage.
Traffic reports include several common statistics you can use to help you 
decipher your report details and understand how your online advertising is 
performing. One such statistic, referred to as site usage or visitors, provides 
an overview of guests’ interaction on your Web site including
 
✓ Visits (not hits): This is the number of guests who visit your Web site 
during the date range that you run the report for. The goal is for this 
number to rise when compared to the same dates in previous periods 
(the total for this year, month, or season compared to the same time 
period in previous years). Always make sure you’re comparing the same 
period from year to year rather than comparing one month to the next.
 
 Numbers are great, but seeing this information in a graph presentation 
is even more helpful. Many programs, such as Google Analytics, let you 
set a date range and compare two time periods at once in the form of a 
graph. (See the nearby sidebar for more info about Google Analytics.)
 
✓ Hits: This is the number of files that load on a Web page. 
 
 Keep in mind that each Web page contains many files. Therefore, one 
page load usually equals many hits and is not a good gauge of the traffic 
on your Web site. Some sites quote hits, but this data is meaningless in 
determining how well your Web site is performing. Don’t confuse hits 
with visitors and pages/visit.
 
✓ Pages/visit: This is the number of pages on your Web site that the aver-
age guest looks at. The higher this number, the better, because the more 
pages a guest looks at, the more interested they are in your site and 
probably your inn. A high number indicates that you’re attracting inter-
ested guests and that your Web site is keeping their attention.
 
✓ Bounce rate: This is the percentage of guests who leave your Web site 
almost as soon as they arrive. A high bounce rate means guests arrived 
at your Web site and immediately decided they weren’t interested. If 
the number is low, you’re doing a good job of attracting the right guests 
to your site — your advertising is on target, and guests like your site 
enough to explore it. If your bounce rate is high, the good news is that 
you’ve found a place to make improvements, either by having more tar-
geted advertising so you’re attracting the right guests, or redesigning 
your site to be more inviting and/or easier to navigate, thereby increas-
ing the number of guests who seriously consider your inn.

297
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
 
✓ Average time on site: This statistic tells you how much time the average 
guest spends on your site. The longer guests stay, the more interested 
they are.
Traffic is a term that refers to a breakdown of where your guests are coming 
from and the search terms they’re using to find you. Related data includes
 
✓ Referrers: This statistic tells you which sites are sending guests to 
your Web site. It allows you to see how many guests come from search 
engines, online directories, chambers, visitors bureaus, associations, 
and other sources. You can also tell how many guests get to your site 
just by typing in your domain name.
 
 This statistic is important because rarely can guests correctly tell you 
where they found you. While guests mean well, they often simply don’t 
remember. They may confuse your Web site with a directory listing for 
your inn simply because it has pictures, prices, and lots of information.
 
 Some online reservation programs require you to configure referral 
source choices for the guest to choose from when they’re making a res-
ervation. A guest can’t identify a source if it’s not on the list, so avoid 
common mistakes like not listing all your advertising sources as choices 
or not keeping your list up-to-date when you join a new directory or add 
a new advertising source. Also, avoid listing abbreviations for associa-
tions or advertising sources (a guest doesn’t know what ABBA is, for 
example). Even when set up correctly, few guests can remember the 
name of the site that they found you on and select it from the list.
 
✓ Keywords: This data tells you the keywords or phrases that guests 
searched to find your site. You want to incorporate these keywords and 
phrases into the text on your Web site. You can also use these words if 
you do pay-per-click adverting (see the discussion earlier in this chap-
ter). You should not, however, base your marketing entirely on the most 
common phrases used to find your site.
Two more statistics are important to your understanding of the traffic on 
your Web site. They are
 
✓ Top entry (landing) page: This is the page that most visitors to your site 
see first. It’s often your home page, but you’ll probably be interested to 
see how many guests enter on other pages too, such as your recipe or 
attraction pages. Once you know where visitors are entering, take a look 
at the bounce rate for each of those pages. Are guests staying on your site 
or leaving immediately? Be sure your site is easy to navigate so guests 
don’t leave simply because they can’t find what they’re looking for.
 
✓ Top exit pages: These are the pages your guests commonly visit just 
before leaving your site. Knowing this can help you identify pages that 
you should devote some time to making more informative, attractive, 
or useful.

Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Networking on the Internet
It’s a whole new world out there, and as an innkeeper, you need to keep your 
priorities in mind. A well-optimized Web site should be your primary goal for 
marketing on the Internet. Next, you need to monitor your online image on 
review sites and directories to control the marketing message around your 
inn.  Then, if you have the time to devote to doing it right, you may want to 
consider interactive forums (such as blogs and Facebook) to generate sales 
leads. At the very least, you should be aware of the forum phenomenon, 
knowing that participation can be a great marketing tool, but only if done cor-
rectly. Don’t feel pressured to be involved, and don’t jump in unless you’ve 
taken the time to learn the etiquette and are committed to devoting the time 
necessary to make it worthwhile in promoting your inn.
Tim Brady, owner of Forty Putney Road Bed & Breakfast in Brattleboro, 
Vermont (www.fortyputneyroad.com) retired as a Chief Technology 
Officer to become an innkeeper. He offers some of the best advice I’ve seen to 
fellow innkeepers:
 
✓ Watch from the sidelines by reading other’s posts until you get the hang 
of how social networking works.
 
✓ Don’t participate unless you’re sharing knowledge. Do not overtly sell 
your inn. Be sure your posts include a link to your Web site, which not 
only helps build links to your site, but also establishes you as an expert.
 
✓ Social networks (MySpace, Facebook, and so on) can be your friend or 
enemy. Selectively join social networks relative to your audience and 
area. Again, don’t sell; make only knowledgeable comments. Let the 
interested audience come to you.
 
✓ Post frequent relevant content if you decide to start your own blog. 
Write conversationally and approve comments of users (not approving 
comments for reasons other than spam control or inappropriate content 
is a big no-no). Avoid posts that you feel will spark controversy on your 
own Web site.
 
✓ Use traveler review sites to your advantage. Check them frequently, 
post a response geared towards the general reader, and do not become 
engaged in an argument with the reviewer.
Staying in touch with online newsletters
Periodic online newsletters are an inexpensive way to keep in touch with 
guests and keep your inn on their minds for return visits and making refer-
rals. A good newsletter is

299
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
 
✓ Attractive: Your newsletter represents your inn and should contain 
images and colors that guests identify with your inn.
 
 A variety of newsletter programs include simple templates that are easy 
to use and require no programming knowledge. Many Web designers 
can also create a template for you that matches the look and feel of your 
Web site. Work with a newsletter program or your Web designer to send 
out your newsletter so that it’s not blocked by SPAM filters.
 
✓ Interesting: True, you’re promoting your inn, but your newsletter 
shouldn’t sound like a sales piece. Include information about happen-
ings at the inn and in the area.
 
✓ Short: Include links back to your Web site, your e-mail, and your avail-
ability calendar. Take advantage of the “read more” feature, which takes 
guests to your Web site where you have the full news story. To do this, 
include an introductory paragraph for each section of your newsletter in 
the newsletter itself with a “read more” link which takes readers to your 
Web site for the full article. This not only brings guests to your Web site 
it also has the added benefit of providing more keyword rich, fresh con-
tent on your Web site for Google to index!
 
✓ Enticing: Offer something to entice guests to your inn, even if it’s a 
ready-made package.
 
Don’t send unsolicited newsletters. Obtain your guests’ permission before 
adding them to your mailing list, and always give them the option to opt out. 
Don’t buy e-mail lists — they’re a waste of money and can brand you as a 
spammer.
Taking Advantage of More Offline 
Marketing Options
Nothing is more exciting than reading about your inn in a newspaper or mag-
azine or hearing it featured on TV or the radio. There’s no specific secret to 
being chosen, but here are some things you can do to increase your chances:
 
✓ Create a press kit. Having a press kit ready when a call comes in ensures 
you’re ready for any press opportunity. Include a fact sheet about your 
inn including your inn’s history, your signature dishes, and some guest 
comments, as well as your brochure and, of course, your business card.
 
 You don’t need to spend a lot of money on a press kit. Get a two-pocket 
folder that matches the color of your inn, and then have postcards made 
with a picture of your inn and your inn’s name on the front. (You’ll get 
plenty of use out of the postcards and you can order them online — 
check out www.vistaprint.com.) Use rubber cement to paste the post 
card in the center of the folder, and arrange your materials inside.

300
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
✓ Add a press room on your Web site. Having pages devoted to the media 
makes it easy for travel writers to get information about your inn and 
download high-resolution photos. Check out www.sladesinn.com/
reviews-press-room.html for a good example.
 
✓ Handle press inquiries with professionalism. Take any press call 
seriously, but be skeptical. Oftentimes travel writers will contact you 
with the promise that they’ll write about your inn in exchange for free 
accommodations. Ask these reporters for examples of similar articles 
that they’ve written and push for details about where the story featur-
ing your inn will be published. While it’s understandable that report-
ers working on a piece will want to stay with you, writers from the top 
newspapers, magazines, and guidebooks will usually do so anonymously 
before featuring your inn in a story.
 
✓ Contact the media. Get to know the editors and writers from your local 
papers and surrounding towns. Invite them to special events and open 
houses at your inn. Consider offering them a stay during your slow 
season (check their policies first, though, with regard to accepting free 
lodging). Periodically create and send the media a press release or your 
newsletter with a note about happenings at your inn.
 
✓ Work with an association. Reporters are more receptive to hearing about 
an area than they are to a sales pitch for a particular inn, so work together 
with your local association to create open houses, tours, and other pack-
ages. Then alert the local media and media in surrounding areas.
 
Ask anyone who writes about your inn for copies of the article and any video; 
then post them on your Web site press page.
Opening New Doors to Sustain Success
Being creative and staying up to date with fresh ideas will bring a constant 
flow of guests to your door. Simply embrace and communicate what is 
unique and special about your inn and then get ready to welcome a host of 
new and interesting guests.
Catering to a niche market
Catering to a group of individuals with particular likes or needs is called 
niche marketing, and it can bring new guests to your inn that you wouldn’t 
have had otherwise. You may be seeing an opportunity to cater to a niche 
market if you can answer “yes” to any of the following:

301
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
 
✓ Have you ever turned away guests because of something you didn’t offer, 
not knowing of any other accommodations to refer them to that had what 
they were asking for? Could you offer what they were looking for?
 
✓ Is there a B&B or hotel that always has numerous guests because of 
something specific that they offer or groups that they cater to? Is this 
something you could also do?
 
✓ Can you identify a trend, such as “going green,” that’s determining how 
some guests are making lodging choices?
This type of marketing could include marketing to motorcyclists, to paint-
ers by hosting painting workshops, to those traveling with pets, or to any 
number of hundreds of targeted groups of travelers. Finding your niche (or 
niches) helps you to distinguish your inn from others in the area and expand 
your marketing message. Catering to a niche market also provides you 
with additional places to advertise, thus bringing more guests to your inn. 
Cultivating your niche is part of building your brand (see Chapter 8 for infor-
mation on building your brand and establishing your inn’s message).
 
What’s pleasing to one group may discourage another. For example, if your 
inn is pet-friendly, guests traveling without pets or those who aren’t fond of 
animals may choose to stay elsewhere. The important thing is clear communi-
cation so that all guests know what to expect. For instance, you may only 
allow pets in certain rooms but not in the common areas. This is important 
information for pet owners and other guests to know, so post this type of 
information clearly wherever your policies are listed (see Chapter 7), remem-
bering you won’t be able to please everyone all of the time.
Unleash your creativity and passions as you have fun thinking of ways to 
attract guests in under-served areas of the market. Do you have a special 
interest or talent? If you do, you’re probably not the only one. Deciding to 
target other like-minded individuals is another way to fill rooms at your inn, 
and you’ll find it enjoyable as well. Do you love helping brides plan weddings? 
Are you an artist? Is cooking a passion? There are endless possibilities for 
niche markets from which you can attract guests and it’s easy to get started:
 
1. Identify a market segment or unfilled need.
 
 Be creative, yet practical. The rewards of niche marketing come when 
you think outside of the box and brainstorm about ideas for groups of 
people you want to attract to your inn.
 
2. Research the feasibility of catering to the niche market you’ve 
identified.
 
 Don’t waste your time on impractical ideas. There could be any number 
of reasons that no one else is catering to your niche, including

302
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
• Not enough potential guests are interested. For example, an inn 
located in an area known for outdoor active getaways will probably 
have little success in attracting additional guests for scrapbooking 
weekends.
 
• Your geographic area doesn’t offer enough activities catering to 
the group’s interests. For example, while identifying your inn as 
gay-friendly might open up new advertising opportunities for you, 
it won’t be an easy niche to cater to if there are no gay-friendly 
bars or restaurants in your town.
 
• Zoning restrictions or regulations are prohibitive. For example, 
even if you’re fielding calls from brides wanting you to hold small 
weddings on your beautiful grounds, zoning restrictions may pro-
hibit you from doing so without a conditional use permit, which 
may be a difficult or impossible undertaking. 
 
3. Once you find a niche that’s workable and likely to attract guests to 
your inn, clearly define that niche. 
 
 Decide exactly who you are targeting, why you are targeting them, what 
you will offer them, and how you will get the word out. For example, if 
your niche is guests who travel with their pets, the steps you need to 
take include the following:
 
• Make sure you have appropriate accommodations for the owners 
and pets you hope to welcome to your inn. Dogs and cats require 
different amenities.
 
• Evaluate and adjust your reservation and damage policies. Make 
sure they include restrictions and additional charges as needed, 
such as a pet cleaning fee.
 
• Update your Web site and marketing materials. Clearly commu-
nicating pet policies is important so that guests who are traveling 
both with and without pets know what to expect.
 
• Update keywords and text on your Web site so that the search 
engines know you accommodate travelers with pets.
 
• Create special packages around your niche. See more on creating 
packages in the next section.
 
• Find new advertising venues by looking for places to market to 
travelers who want to bring their pets. Do Internet searches for 
terms such as “pets welcome,” “travel with pets,” “pet travel,” and 
so on to find directories and blogs you can use to get the word out 
that you accommodate this group of travelers.
 
• Issue a press release. Companies such as PRWeb (www.prweb.
com) and TransWorldNews (www.transworldnews.com) offer 
economical services to issue online press releases. A side benefit 
of a press release is that you can include your keywords with links 
to your Web site.

303
 Chapter 15: Assessing Your Success and Building on It 
 
• Note any articles that have been written on traveling with pets 
and contact the writers to let them know about your inn. (See 
the earlier section, “Amping up your media exposure,” for tips on 
working with travel writers.)
Packages: Bundling services that sell
Packages are a great way to bundle services together. Ready-made pack-
ages present an appealing marketing message, and they’re an easy add-on or 
upgrade for a guest who’s already making a reservation to stay at your B&B. 
Although many guests don’t think to ask what else is available for their stay, 
most are pleased to hear what other special treats you have for them. Guests 
see packages as something extra that adds to their experience at your B&B, 
and your revenue increases from the additional service — a win-win for both 
you and your guests.
You can add packages to reservations taken either over the phone or online. 
Asking about special occasions when taking phone reservations creates a 
continuous opportunity to offer add-ons and upgrades to guests. You can 
also advertise packages on your Web site. Many reservation software sys-
tems make it easy for you to offer them to your guests as they’re completing 
their reservations. For example, after the guest has selected a room and is in 
the final steps of submitting a reservation, the opportunity to add a spa ser-
vice such as a massage can be offered.
The benefits of creating packages are numerous. Packages offer
 
✓ Reinforcement of your brand and your inn’s image. Creating romance 
packages, for example, reinforces the idea that your inn is a good choice 
for those seeking a romantic getaway — even if they don’t book the 
actual package.
 
✓ Additional revenue. Packages allow for up-selling. They’re also a great 
way to bundle several items, services, and features together for one price.
 
✓ A means to offer discounts without cutting room prices. By packaging 
several full-price items together with your room, you can then offer a 
discount to the guest on the full package and end up with more revenue 
than if you had discounted just the room rate for the guest.
 
✓ Extra promotional opportunities. Guests using online directories often 
start on the specials and packages pages, so your inn will be seen first if 
you’re listed on these pages. The directories feature specials and pack-
ages in their newsletters and press releases to the media as well, again 
resulting in extra exposure for your inn. The media may also take info 
about your packages from your Web site or online directories and pro-
vide additional coverage for you.

304
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
It’s okay to be inspired by other innkeepers, but don’t copy their packages 
exactly. Your packages should be unique to your inn. Refer to Table 15-1 for 
successful package ideas that combine creativity and niche marketing.

Keeping Your Most Important 
Asset (You) Fine-Tuned
In This Chapter
▶ Working your business so it doesn’t work you
▶ Finding ways to take a break
▶ Continuing the never-ending learning process
D
o you work to live or do you live to work? For many innkeepers, this 
distinction is a blurred one, and that’s okay — as long as you’re run-
ning the business and it’s not running you. 
In this chapter, I share my favorite sanity-saving tips as well as advice from 
seasoned innkeepers who’ve learned (sometimes the hard way) how to set 
boundaries and keep themselves motivated and happy in the B&B business. I 
also discuss ways to grow professionally, from joining associations to attend-
ing conferences. These resources can give you the support you need and 
renew your enthusiasm when the business overwhelms you.
Running Your Business 
So It Doesn’t Run You
In the beginning, carving out time for yourself is difficult. Your lists of things 
to do and bills to pay seem endless, leaving you feeling that there’s no time 
or money left for anything else. Hopefully, your excitement at becoming an 
innkeeper will carry you through these times, but as the euphoria wears off 
and fatigue sets in, I caution you to be aware and ready for it. Feeling tired 
and overworked is hard to hide. Guests sense it in the way you respond to 
them, and it can show in your dealings with your staff. While these reactions 
are normal, the trick is to ward off these feelings. When you feel in control, 
you’re working the business instead of letting the business work you.

306
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Longtime innkeepers are a good source of advice because they’ve been in 
your shoes. Here are some of their best suggestions:
 
✓ Make a list of what you like about being an innkeeper. Your list will 
be unique to you, so add to it and change it as your ideas change. You’ll 
have your own reasons, but your list may look something like this:
 
• I like being my own boss.
 
• I like not having to get dressed up or having to commute to work.
 
• I like meeting interesting people.
 
• I like that I’m never bored and that no two days are the same.
 
• I like receiving instant feedback and gratification from satisfied 
guests.
 
• I like being able to be creative.
 
✓ Make a list of what you dislike about innkeeping. Don’t kid yourself; 
innkeeping is a job and there are aspects that aren’t fun. I’m sure your 
list will vary in length depending on the day — and the guests you’ve just 
hosted — so stick to the big things and then look for ways to turn them 
into a positive. For example, you may not like the feeling that your work is 
never done, or dealing with demanding guests. Pull back and think about 
how many wonderful and interesting people you’ve met because of these 
long hours and the fabulous compliments you’ve received.
 
✓ Let go of your pursuit of perfection. There will always be a room that 
needs painting and a housekeeper who forgets to put a towel in the 
guest room. Remind yourself that guests don’t see most of the things 
that you think are less than perfect about your property.
 
✓ Don’t take criticism personally. The good thing about this business is 
dealing with people, and the hard thing about this business is dealing 
with people. Some people are impossible to please (thankfully, these 
people are a minority). Although it’s easier said than done, longtime 
innkeepers recommend that you not take things personally. They also 
identify and cater to the types of guests who’ll be happy at their inns. 
(See Chapter 2 for information on matching guests to your B&B’s style.)
 
✓ Understand that you can’t please everyone all the time. It’s impossible 
to be everything to everyone. Know this and accept it.
 
✓ Have a sense of humor. It’s easy to be so busy that you don’t take the 
time to find the humor in a situation and to laugh a little.
 
✓ Be sure your circle of friends includes innkeepers, other small busi-
ness owners, and people who are neither innkeepers nor business 
owners. Isolating yourself from other innkeepers and business owners 
means losing out on a support network of resources and common under-
standing. Spending time with non-innkeeping friends is a refreshing way 
to think about something other than your business.

307
 Chapter 16: Keeping Your Most Important Asset (You) Fine-Tuned 
 
✓ See your inn through the eyes of others. Invite a friend over who hasn’t 
seen the inn in a while. Listen to and appreciate the rave comments 
you’re sure to receive. Let them rejuvenate you.
 
✓ Look at the big picture. Understand that guests are going to do what 
guests are going to do. For example, guests often rearrange furniture in a 
room. Ask yourself whether it really matters. Is it damaging the property 
or interfering with another guest’s enjoyment? If not, resign yourself to 
putting it back when they leave.
 
✓ Recognize when you need to get away. See the section “Making time for 
yourself” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Take compliments to heart. Don’t brush off compliments. Hear their sin-
cerity and appreciate your accomplishments, talents, and skills.
Getting extra help
No matter what size your bed and breakfast is, running a B&B is a lot of work. 
Whether you do it on your own or with a partner and/or staff, the role of inn-
keeper encompasses many jobs in one. Recognizing this and knowing when 
you need extra help can not only help you to run a more successful business 
but it also helps you to stay in business by preventing burnout. See Chapter 
14 for information on hiring others and outsourcing tasks.
 
Extra help doesn’t have to mean bringing living, breathing beings on board. 
Another option is to buy equipment that makes your life easier; see Chapter 
13 for more information.
Sticking to your policies
For every rule, there is an exception — or is there? Ask yourself: “Are there 
too many exceptions? Do I say yes when I really mean no?” If you find yourself 
answering yes to these questions, you’re not alone. The trick of seasoned inn-
keepers is knowing when to be flexible and when to stand firm.
Sometimes making decisions regarding your policies is easy, but oftentimes 
it’s not. Most decisions are not clear-cut, and the decision you make may be 
in contrast to what another innkeeper would do in your place. For example, 
as a matter of policy, many innkeepers don’t rent the entire inn to groups 
because they’ve found them to be too demanding. Other inns make it their 
policy to specifically cater to group rentals of the entire inn. If your policy is 
not to rent to groups, you made that policy for a reason, so my advice is to 
stick to it. If you make an exception against your better judgment and it’s a 
disaster, you’ll find yourself frustrated with the situation and yourself.

308
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
 
Certain policies are nonnegotiable, and you should always stand firm if the 
guest is causing damage to the inn or otherwise affecting another guest.
Some of the decisions that cause new innkeepers the most angst are those 
related to guests who cancel reservations. Do you consider cancellations 
part of the cost of doing business, do you strictly charge guests a cancella-
tion or no-show fee, or do you do something in between? How you handle 
cancellations is ultimately up to you. Many innkeepers feel guilty when they 
enforce their cancellation policies. Remember, however, you’re making a 
business decision.
Sometimes there is no right answer to the question of whether to enforce 
a particular policy, and you need to handle each situation differently. But 
it’s important for you to become comfortable with your policies so you can 
enforce them with confidence. You’ll save yourself a lot of aggravation and 
get back time and energy that you can spend more productively.
Getting support from others
The ultimate responsibility of running the bed & breakfast will fall to you, but 
you don’t have to feel alone. Recognizing and using all available resources, 
including a support system, is important. Family, friends, and the support of 
other innkeepers are valuable assets. They can often provide help or sugges-
tions, or just provide a listening ear when you need it.
Obviously, you don’t want to overburden others. If you feel this is happen-
ing, you need to look more closely at the problem and explore solutions. 
For example, sounding off occasionally about staffing issues is a normal way 
to relieve frustration, but if it’s a constant theme, you need to look at your 
staff, examine how clearly and firmly you’re managing them, and decide what 
changes you need to make. (See Chapter 14 for help with your help.)
 
There will be times when family and friends will not understand why you’re 
missing a family or social event. Few people can relate to a 24/7/365 job, 
except fellow innkeepers, so make it a point to get to know other innkeepers 
(see Chapter 1 for help in finding an innkeeper support network).
Making time for yourself
Making time for yourself can be as simple as taking a walk or a nap in the after-
noon or going out for the evening with friends, having a “date night” with your 
partner or spouse, or it can mean getting away from the inn for a few days. The 
problem most innkeepers encounter is giving themselves permission to do 
this. No matter how busy you are, taking time off is possible and you deserve it.

309
 Chapter 16: Keeping Your Most Important Asset (You) Fine-Tuned 
 
One of the benefits of innkeeping is that you’re the boss. If you don’t carve out 
time for yourself and your outside interests, eventually you’ll begin to resent 
innkeeping. You must make a conscious effort and a commitment to yourself 
to take the time you need.
 
When you do take some time away from the inn, leave with a free mind by 
having policies in place. (See Chapter 12 for information on leaving guests 
alone at the inn.)
Taking an afternoon off for a walk in the park is great, but you also need a 
vacation, just like everyone else. One option is to close the inn while you’re 
away; however, you lose revenue not only from being closed, but also from 
guests who are unable to call and make future reservations.
How do you plan to take a vacation and keep the inn running? This is where 
the use of well-trained staff, a partner who can run the inn in your absence, 
and/or an interim innkeeper comes in. If you have well trained and com-
petent staff, getting away should not be difficult. If not, don’t overlook the 
effect that a professionally trained interim innkeeper can have on your busi-
ness. That person can cook breakfast, clean rooms, take reservations for 
future dates, and handle guest emergencies, whereas dear cousin Charlie 
may not be up for the challenge. (See Chapter 14 for more info about hiring 
an interim innkeeper.)
Should you close your inn or hire a stand-in?
When you’re planning a vacation or need to 
be away from your inn in an emergency, you 
may find yourself vacillating between hiring an 
interim innkeeper and closing the inn. How do 
the costs stack up against each other? Here’s a 
simple exercise to help you find out:
 1. Using your estimated occupancy rate and 
your base room rate, calculate the approxi-
mate revenue that you would expect your 
inn to generate during the period that you’ll 
be away. (See Chapter 3 for help in estimat-
ing occupancy and calculating your base 
room rate.)
 2. Double it, because most interim innkeepers 
also take reservations for future dates that 
you’ll lose if you’re not there to answer the 
phone. (If many of your reservations are 
from online bookings, adjust the calcula-
tions accordingly to reflect the percentage 
of rooms booked by phone and e-mail.)
 3. Add these two figures together to deter-
mine the revenue you’ll lose if you simply 
close the inn while you’re away.
 4. Subtract the cost of the interim innkeeper to 
find the cost of keeping the inn open using 
that person’s services. (Don’t forget to add 
in the value of getting a vacation!)

Benefitting from Professional 
Development
Pick up any small business handbook and you’ll read about the benefits of 
professional development. Running a bed & breakfast is a business and inn-
keeping is a profession, so these benefits apply to you. Thankfully, numerous 
professional resources are available to help you sharpen your skills and find 
support. Some of the most important benefits of investing your time and 
money in professional development include:
 
✓ Improving your knowledge and skills
 
✓ Finding answers to your questions and concerns
 
✓ Discovering renewed energy and rejuvenation
 
✓ Networking within your industry
 
✓ Meeting and gaining support from others who face the same challenges 
you do
Knowledge is power and a key element in the growth and development of 
your chosen profession. Your fellow innkeepers possess an abundance of 
knowledge — as do you, even if you don’t think so yet. Harness this power 
by joining a professional association of other innkeepers and by attending an 
innkeeper conference. Luckily for you, both are easy to do.
Joining a professional association
Innkeepers around the world have joined together to form professional asso-
ciations that provide support through camaraderie, exchange of ideas, and 
access to information. When you put yourself in contact with others who 
share your passion for innkeeping, you’ll often find the result is rejuvenating 
and helps you renew your commitment to your business. 
There are local and regional associations as well as associations for many 
states in the United States and provinces in Canada. Many countries have 
also formed innkeeper networks. The largest organization is an international 
association, the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII).
In some areas you have an abundance of choices, and in this case I urge you to 
select carefully. If you join too many groups or associations at once you won’t 
be able to efficiently take advantage of what each has to offer. If your state has 
a bed & breakfast association, this is the logical place to start, followed by the 
Professional Association of Innkepeers International. No matter where you are 
in the process of running your bed & breakfast, these associations, and their 
conferences, will provide you with a wealth of information and inspiration.

311
 Chapter 16: Keeping Your Most Important Asset (You) Fine-Tuned 
 
Search for local, region, and state associations online by entering the key 
search words “your city”, “your town”, “your region”, or “your state” fol-
lowed by “bed breakfast association”. You may be in luck and find the associ-
ation this way. If no associations are listed you’ll probably find a list of inns 
in the area. Contact some of these innkeepers and ask about associations 
that they belong to and recommend. As an aside, this is an excellent time to 
invite the innkeeper to your inn for coffee or tea — you may have found a 
new friend for support and friendship, who in turn might invite you to meet 
other local innkeepers that he or she is friends with.
Associations come in all sizes from small local groups to large national networks.
 
✓ Local associations: You may be able to join an association of innkeepers 
who operate within a given city or tourist destination. Members of local 
associations often create joint marketing campaigns, rely on each other 
for networking and support, as well as group together to support or 
oppose legislation that affects their inns.
 
✓ Regional associations: Associations at this level help innkeepers with 
regional marketing and local lobbying efforts. They’re often large enough 
to hold local conferences where you can meet with other innkeepers, 
exchange ideas, and meet industry vendors.
 
✓ State and province associations: These associations usually hold an 
annual conference. They can provide marketing for their member inns 
and, as a group, serve as a strong lobbying association for issues that 
affect the bed & breakfast industry.
 
✓ The Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII): In 
1988, innkeepers Pat Hardy and JoAnn Bell created PAII. Today, PAII 
(pronounced “pie”) is an international organization that has grown 
to over 3,000 members. PAII holds an annual convention, supports a 
members-only forum, and offers a wide variety of other resources on 
its Web site (www.paii.org) and to its members.
In addition to innkeeper associations, you may want to consider getting 
involved in your local community and your chamber of commerce and/or 
convention and visitors bureau to help you keep up with local events and 
happenings that can affect your business. Often this networking brings you 
referrals and local business, too. Many innkeepers find the personal and pro-
fessional satisfaction of getting out and being with others invigorating.
Attending an innkeeping conference
There is no other industry that I can think of like the B&B industry — where 
owners pour their hearts, energy, and resources into it with so much inten-
sity that most live on the job. Eventually you may reach a point where you 
ask yourself, Can I keep doing this? If you’re at this point, you’re not alone.

312
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
To resolve your feelings, I urge you to attend an innkeeping conference. The 
energy, ideas, and optimism are contagious. Speaking with other innkeepers 
at a time like this can provide the renewed energy that turns you back around 
and sends all thoughts of putting the inn on the market out of your mind.
Joyce, at the Chambered Nautilus Bed & Breakfast Inn in Seattle, Washington, 
recently shared with me that in her eighth year, she was ready to put her inn 
up for sale when a wise innkeeper asked her, “Why would you do that? You’ve 
just gotten over most of the hard part.” Joyce is now in her twelfth year of inn-
keeping and has shared many of the ideas included in this chapter as a moti-
vational speaker at industry conferences.
A variety of innkeeping conferences are held on the local, state, and national 
level every year. You don’t have to travel far to find one near you. When you 
attend an innkeeping conference, you can expect to:
 
✓ Learn from experienced innkeepers
 
✓ Network and meet other innkeepers
 
✓ Attend workshops on a variety of topics from baking to bookkeeping
 
✓ Find fresh new ideas and ways of doing things
 
✓ See products and demonstrations by a variety of industry vendors all in 
one place who can answer your questions in person
 
✓ Have a lot of fun and make lifelong friends
Once you’ve found the associations that you’re interested in, ask about 
upcoming conferences and mark the dates and details on your calendar. 
Some regional associations hold conferences, and nearly all state associa-
tions either hold their own conference or group together with nearby states 
for a larger conference. Most associations that hold conferences and the 
Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) hold annual con-
ferences which usually last two to several days and offer workshops which 
are geared to aspiring, new, and veteran innkeepers. To choose a conference 
look carefully at the schedule and evaluate your interest in the sessions that 
are offered. Then, ask other innkeepers which conferences they recommend. 
When you teach, you learn, and you’ll be able to share your experiences with 
others. Sharing your knowledge, enthusiasm, and love for innkeeping with 
others helps you to grow. No matter where you are in the process of running 
your bed & breakfast, I encourage you to begin sharing with others. You’ve 
already learned something that others would want to know just by reading 
this book (hopefully many things)! If you’re just starting out, attend an aspir-
ing or new innkeeper workshop and share your experiences. If you’re a new 
or veteran innkeeper, volunteer to be on a panel and share your current and 
relevant experiences with aspiring innkeepers who are following in your foot-
steps; you’ll be recommitting yourself to the profession.

In This Chapter
▶ Adding more services to make more money
▶ Expanding your current inn or buying another one
▶ Choosing your exit strategy
You’re over the hump, and you’ve got this innkeeping gig down to a sci-
ence. Well, almost. So now what? Are you still energized? Do you want 
to grow and expand in big ways? Or are you losing steam and thinking it 
may be time to bow out of the innkeeping business? Both scenarios require 
advance planning, and no rule says that you can’t and shouldn’t plan for both 
at once.
In this chapter, I show you ways to prepare for and achieve both outcomes: 
moving up and moving out. I discuss ways to grow your business, from 
expanding your services to adding to the physical size of your inn or — for 
even more fun — taking on an additional inn. At the same time, I help you to 
plan your exit strategy so you’re ready for the day when you start to think 
about leaving the business behind.
Deciding when to Grow Your Business
Your business is running smoothly, you’re enjoying many repeat guests, you 
have lots of satisfied guests who send you fabulous referrals . . . so what else 
is there? Maybe status quo is the best place to be. You sure can’t fault your-
self for being a success, and don’t underestimate the hard work it will still 
take to maintain your success in the bed & breakfast business. However, if 
you’re wondering what else is there, then you may be ready to take on more, 
and this section helps you explore ideas and options.
If you’re at the point where you think it’s time to make changes in your busi-
ness, the first question you need to ask yourself is why? Pull back and examine 
your motivation. Do you think you should make a particular change because 
everyone else is doing it, or do you have a great new idea for a service or ame-
nity that you’re passionate about adding? You may answer yes to both.

314
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
When it comes to growing your bed & breakfast business, being both a leader 
and a follower can be beneficial, but most importantly, you need to be an 
independent thinker. Following are tips on how to play each role:
 
✓ To be a leader: Offer something no one else is offering. Listen carefully, 
and make note of amenities or services that guests are asking for that 
neither you nor your competitors in the area provide. For example, do 
you receive calls from families looking for a venue to get together for a 
family reunion? If so, creating a family reunion package might be a great 
way to attract new guests.
 
✓ To be a follower: Check out what other inns in your area are offering 
and, if it makes sense, do the same. For example, if many inns in your 
area offer mugs and local jams or coffees for sale and these products are 
popular with their guests, why not offer similar items from your inn?
 
✓ To be an independent thinker: Seek out and offer solutions to needs 
that no one is asking for. . . yet. Begin by looking at your local commu-
nity, and consider potential guests that you’re currently not targeting. 
What services are missing? For instance, do local corporations have 
a comfortable place to hold meetings and retreats? What about clubs 
and organizations? If not, consider renting your common area or dining 
room for meetings and events, as long as doing so wouldn’t interfere 
with your current lodging guests. If your inn isn’t licensed and permitted 
to make meals other than breakfast, would it be possible to arrange for 
meal delivery to your inn for these groups?
Exploring Ways to Increase Profit
Your profit is sales (revenues) minus expenses, or what is left at the end of 
the day. Simply put, increasing your profit means bringing in more money, 
spending less money, or both. Refer to Chapter 15 for help in decreasing and 
controlling expenses; then check out the following sections for ways to bring 
in additional revenue.
Raising your prices
Your bed & breakfast’s success depends on having room rates that are high 
enough to be profitable to you, yet reasonable enough to attract guests and 
keep your rooms occupied. A high occupancy rate means that demand for 
rooms at the current price is high. If you raise your rates too high, your 
guests may bypass your inn and choose the competition or stay fewer nights, 
causing your occupancy rate to decrease. The trick is to figure out how much 
you can comfortably raise your rates to bring in more revenue without caus-
ing a net loss in profit through decreased occupancy.

315
 Chapter 17: Looking into Your Future 
Figuring out the price point for safely raising your rates and increasing your 
revenue is a juggling act. For example, if last year a given room was booked 
100 times at an average price of $125 per night, your annual revenue for that 
room was $12,500. Say the next year you raised the room rate to $150 per 
night and booked it 95 nights. Your revenue would be $14,250, meaning that 
a 20 percent increase in your room rate resulted in only a 5 percent drop in 
occupancy. Not only did you have to clean the room five fewer times, but 
you also had an overall increase in revenue of $1,750. In this scenario, raising 
your rates would be a good decision. If, however, you raised the room rate to 
$150 and you were only able to fill the room 75 nights, your revenue would 
decline to $11,250, an overall loss of $1,250. (Refer to Chapter 7 for additional 
help in setting your rates.)
Offering additional amenities
Raising your prices is only one means to increase your revenue. Another way 
is to add value to a guest’s stay. If the added value of additional amenities 
or services costs you less than the amount by which you raise your rates, 
you’ve found another way to increase your revenue stream.
For example, consider creating a romance package (I suggest other package 
ideas in Chapter 15). The package could include a couples massage and a 
private in-room breakfast for an additional charge of $250. If you pay the mas-
sage therapists $75 apiece, your cost for the package is $150. Your revenue 
increases by $250 and your profit by $100. (This assumes that the in-room 
breakfast doesn’t have any additional costs associated with it. Many innkeep-
ers prefer serving in-room breakfasts because once the guests are served, 
they are taken care of for the time being -- although you will have to wait until 
you turn or fluff the room to get the dishes and run the dishwasher.)
Adding services and amenities can be a fun way to increase your business’s 
profitability. Let your creativity flow. Think about new guests that you could 
target and what would attract them to your inn. Would they be interested in 
yoga classes? Weekend-long prenatal classes? Spa getaways?
 
Be careful not to become so excited with an idea that you forget some impor-
tant considerations:
 
✓ Costs versus revenue: Does the product or service cost you more to 
provide than you can reasonably charge for it?
 
✓ Demand: Is the product or service one that your guests will be 
interested in?
 
✓ Opportunity cost: What are you giving up in order to offer the product 
or service? Could you be making better use of your time and the space 
at your inn if you weren’t providing it? For example, you may think it’s a 
great idea to dedicate a room for massages or as a workout room. Keep 

316
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
track of how many guests take advantage of these services versus the 
revenue that you are giving up on a room rental or another service that 
guests would use more. Or you may be an avid biker and think that bike 
tours are a great idea. However, between the increased insurance cost 
and the amount of time away conducting the tours, will your new offer-
ing make a profit?
Think about new target groups of guests you could attract to fill rooms 
when bookings are ordinarily low, such as weeknights and during your slow 
season. A few years after Thurston House, (www.thurstonhouse.com), a 
B&B in Maitland, Florida, opened for business, the innkeeper noticed that 
guests traveling on business were asking for services such as the use of a fax 
machine. The inn added a few common amenities for business travelers and 
began prominently advertising to this group. Today, many rooms are filled 
midweek by business travelers, who are also frequent repeat guests and a 
great source of referrals. Common amenities for business travelers include
 
✓ Work desks with phone/modem hook-ups
 
✓ Complimentary wireless Internet access
 
✓ An on-site fax machine
 
✓ In-room telephones (particularly if you’re in a remote area with poor 
cellphone service)
 
✓ An early-breakfast option
 
✓ Corporate rates
 
✓ A flexible cancellation policy
 
✓ Private bath
 
✓ Acceptance of major credit cards
 
Think outside the box. Guests are not always who you think they are. Most 
innkeepers associate business travelers with large corporations. However, 
many of the business travelers at the Thurston House are pharmaceutical 
reps, non-profit employees, designers, and furniture reps.
Hosting weddings and special events
Many inns successfully host weddings and other special events, from small 
elopements to large extravaganzas, while others avoid them like the plague. 
If you’re considering hosting weddings, or other large events, seek out advice 
from fellow innkeepers who have successfully done so (see Chapter 1 for 
help in connecting with other innkeepers).

317
 Chapter 17: Looking into Your Future 
Be sure to check local zoning laws, which may or may not permit you to host 
weddings and other special events at your inn. You may be able to get the 
variances necessary to hold these events. Sometimes called conditional-use-
permits, they’ll spell out the conditions under which you can host special 
events and may limit the number of events that you can hold each year, the 
size of the events, and so on. Decisions on variances and special-use permits 
are usually governed on the local level and the ease in attaining the neces-
sary variances differs greatly by area. Here are some other things you need 
to consider:
 
✓ Parking: Determine the amount of on-site parking available in terms of 
width, length, and number of spaces, as well as street or other parking.
 
✓ Entrances and exits: Guests must be able to efficiently get in and out of 
the property.
 
✓ Maximum occupancy: This is the maximum number of people you can 
accommodate per room, per floor, per common area, or on the grounds.
 
✓ Fire regulations: These specify required safety and fire protection 
equipment, emergency exits, signs, and lighting.
 
✓ ADA compliance requirements: ADA stands for Americans with 
Disabilities Act and sets requirements for accommodating those with spe-
cial needs. To access the ADA information line for answers to your ques-
tions about what may be required, visit www.ada.gov/infoline.htm.
 
✓ Commercial kitchen requirements: In many areas, a commercial 
kitchen is required for catering special events.
 
✓ Availability of public restrooms: You need a sufficient number of rest-
rooms to accommodate event guests.
 
✓ How your neighbors feel about it: Hearings are usually held before con-
ditional or new variances are awarded, and your neighbors can be your 
best allies — or your worst enemies. (See Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion on zoning and variances.)
 
To let guests know about the various types of events you’re willing and able to 
host, post links to pages that detail the relevant information clearly on the 
home page of your Web site. Not only do these pages provide important infor-
mation for guests, but they’re also keyword-rich, which helps your Web site 
place higher in Internet searches. Check out the Admiral Peary House’s Web 
site at www.admiralpearyhouse.com for an example of a beautiful page 
devoted to wedding services.
 
It’s important to evaluate whether hosting weddings or other special events is 
worth your time and energy. For example, if a new wedding business gener-
ates only $2,000 in profits per year but takes a huge amount of time and 
results in wear and tear on the inn, is it worth it? Make sure you track reve-
nues and costs!

318
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Adding a gift shop
Adding a gift shop is a natural step for many innkeepers. Local items, such 
as jams and coffees, and items displaying the inn’s name and logo, such as 
robes and mugs, are popular. Some factors to consider when thinking about 
opening a gift shop include
 
✓ Space versus revenue: Your highest profit margins are typically on your 
rooms. Would the space that you plan to devote to your gift shop be 
better used as an additional guest room? (Don’t forget to verify zoning 
restrictions for the additional guest room or gift shop.)
 
✓ High overhead: Opening a gift shop requires an investment in inventory, 
which means tying up funds.
 
✓ Inventory storage: Space is required in order to store additional products.
 
✓ Zoning issues: Check with your local zoning officials before investing in 
a gift shop. Your inn may not be zoned to offer one without a variance. 
However, this may not prevent you from selling items that you use at the 
inn such as mugs, jams, robes, and so on by simply letting guests know 
that they are available for sale, in a display case for example.
 
✓ Seller’s permit: You need a seller’s permit if sales tax is collected on 
retail items in your location. This permit authorizes you to collect tax on 
purchases and turn these taxes over to the state.
 
✓ Natural fit: You might love antique dolls, but the fact that they’re your 
passion doesn’t mean that selling them would be profitable. Know your 
guests, and only carry items that they’re likely to purchase. A good rule 
of thumb is to sell items you use at your inn.
 
Many inns have had success selling mugs with their logo from Deneen Pottery 
(www.cloth-clay.com), a long-time supplier to the bed & breakfast indus-
try. Guests who use the mugs during their stay often purchase them as 
mementos of their visit, as gifts to bring home, or simply because they enjoy 
the feel of the mugs. Each mug taken home brings with it an advertisement for 
the inn at which it was purchased.
Renovating Your Inn
Renovating your inn has exciting possibilities. Maybe you want to open up 
the back of the inn to expand your breakfast seating area or add more guest 
rooms. Or you may decide that the cost of adding in-suite bathrooms is a 
good investment because they’ll allow you to increase your room rates now, 
and add value when you sell the inn later. As you approach these projects, it’s 
natural to have questions like Where do I start? and Can I do renovations and 
host guests at the same time? The following sections address those concerns.

319
 Chapter 17: Looking into Your Future 
Going back to square one
 
Before starting renovations, you should keep good statistical data to analyze 
whether the costs are justified. Assuming they are, in many respects expand-
ing and renovating your inn requires taking the same measures you took when 
you first opened your inn.
To get started, you need to check with your local zoning department to be 
sure your plans will be approved. Even though your inn is your business — 
and probably also your home — local zoning ordinances dictate what’s 
allowable in the way of expansion and renovation plans. Although smaller in 
scope, the renovation process is essentially a new construction project, and it 
requires you to take the same steps to verify zoning, select a contractor, and 
so on (see Chapter 5 for detailed information). Even seemingly minor renova-
tions require you to obtain building permits and have the work performed by 
licensed architects, plumbers, and electricians. (Work performed without the 
necessary permits or by unlicensed contractors and sub-contractors may void 
your insurance protection, not to mention cause problems later when you sell 
the business.)
 
Check to see that your proposed renovation won’t suddenly require you to 
qualify under all sorts of other compliances that you were previously exempt 
from. For example, you might be required to install sprinkler systems; out-
door, covered fire escapes; or a full commercial kitchen. A small renovation 
can easily turn into a major — and very expensive — construction project, if 
even small changes to the property force you to meet other codes.
Handling guests during construction
Once you’ve decided to go ahead with your project, you need to decide how 
you’ll handle guest reservations for those guests who will be staying with you 
during the renovations. Some jobs may be performed on a definite date, but 
other times you may be on a contractor’s wait list or awaiting the arrival of 
appliances, fixtures, and such. Indefinite factors like these make blocking out 
exact dates for renovations impossible.
So how do you handle hosting guests? The answer really depends on the 
type of renovations you’re having done and how easily you can work around 
guests without inconveniencing them. For big jobs, you’ll probably need to 
close during renovation. However, for less-major improvements, oftentimes 
inns continue to host guests because guests are usually out during the day, 
when the work is being performed.
Next you need to decide whether to notify guests ahead of time. Innkeepers 
have differing opinions about how to handle this question, and no single 
answer fits every situation. Most inns decide to call guests because their first 

320
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
concern is their guests’ comfort. You can explain exactly what’s going on 
and what inconveniences the work will entail. This often heads off problems 
before they can occur. Most guests will react by thanking you for letting them 
know, while keeping their reservation. However, if guests want to cancel their 
reservations, let them do so and chalk it up to the cost of doing business. 
Better to give guests a choice than to risk negative online reviews of your inn 
and damaging repercussions. 
If during the guests’ stays the inconveniences are more than you anticipated, 
make amends by giving guests a discount or other special consideration to 
thank them for putting up with disturbances. After your renovations are com-
plete, both you and your future guests will be able to enjoy the benefits with 
no lingering bad memories.
Buying Another Inn
Purchasing a second inn is another way to expand your business. Advantages 
include having some economies of scale (ordering supplies in bulk, for exam-
ple) and being able to refer guest overflow from one of your inns to the other. 
However, you’re still looking at twice as much work, and this may require 
you to hire staff that you may not have needed before.
The most successful way to effectively handle ownership of multiple inns 
is to buy a property that’s geographically close to your existing inn. This 
strategy allows you to maintain the hands-on control and the provision 
of personal attention that running a true bed & breakfast commands. One 
exception worth noting is owning seasonal inns with opposite open and 
closed periods, and moving between the inns by season.
Juggling inns successfully
Whether you own one inn or several, careful 
planning and organization are the keys to suc-
cess. Innkeeper Carolyn Lee provides a good 
example. In 1987, Carolyn bought Alexander’s 
Inn (www.alexanders-inn.com) in Santa 
Fe, New Mexico. Nine years later she bought an 
inn a few blocks away — Hacienda Nicholas 
(www.haciendanicholas.com) — and 
six months later the inn across the street, The 
Madeleine Bed & Breakfast (www.madeleine
inn.com). Carolyn wasn’t necessarily plan-
ning on expanding; rather, the opportunities of 
the two new inns presented themselves. She 
was able to make it work and maintain a per-
sonal touch at all the inns because of their close 
proximity to each other. Although each inn had 
a main innkeeper, Carolyn stayed involved with 
the guests and breakfasts. After seven years of 
running three inns, she converted Alexander’s 
Inn into vacation rentals. To be able to visit with 
all guests, breakfast for the two remaining inns 
is served at Hacienda Nicholas.

 Chapter 17: Looking into Your Future 
Some of the first steps to take when considering the purchase of an addi-
tional inn are:
 
✓ Deciding how you will divide your time
 
✓ Figuring out what additional staff you will need to hire
 
✓ Determining if the second inn will operate independently or if it will be 
an extension of your original inn.
When It’s Time for a Change
All good things eventually come to an end, and you’re smart to start planning 
your exit strategy long before you even think about selling or closing your 
inn. No matter where you are in the inn ownership process, now is the time 
to think about your future plans. How long do you plan to be an innkeeper? 
What will you do after you sell or close your inn? None of these questions 
are intended to discourage you or to persuade you to sell or close your inn 
before you’re ready, but they’re important enough to mention here so that 
you can start thinking about life after innkeeping.
 
The best time to think about your exit strategy, whether you plan to sell your 
inn or retire, is when you’re putting together your business plan (subject to 
change with the times); see Chapter 3.
Selling the inn
The long-term goal of many innkeepers is to create a profitable bed & break-
fast that one day they will sell. It seems counterintuitive to think about selling 
your business while you’re putting so much time and effort into starting it, 
but incorporating good selling points into your plans is smart thinking. It’s 
not something you need to entertain on a daily basis, however. In fact, it’s 
better if you don’t, because on tough days (and there will be plenty of those) 
selling might seem like the only rational thing to do.
 
Life has a way of surprising us. If you’re the managing owner of your inn, life 
changes are more complicated because your home and business are affected 
at the same time. Maybe you suddenly can’t run your B&B anymore because 
you or your partner become ill or suffer a debilitating injury, or maybe you 
simply want to move closer to family. If you need to be away temporarily, con-
sider hiring an interim innkeeper to keep the inn open and running (see 
Chapter 14). If, however, you decide that selling the inn is your only option, 
you’ll be glad you took the steps outlined in this section and have been gradu-
ally preparing for the sale of the inn.

322
Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Knowing when to sell
The time to sell your bed & breakfast is not determined solely by market 
conditions; rather, the ideal time to sell your inn is before you’re ready to 
sell. This time is different for everyone and is meant to warn you against wait-
ing too long to consider selling your inn. If you’re like many innkeepers and 
are emotionally attached to your inn, it’s easy to put off thinking about your 
exit strategy. Periodically examine your long term goals. When you get to the 
point that you think you can do another 2 to 3 years, it’s time to think about 
selling. Don’t wait until you’ve slowed down, when you’ve let your marketing 
initiatives slip, and when your energy and enthusiasm for running the B&B 
are waning. You’ll receive the best price for your inn when it’s going strong, 
when you’re putting your best energy into it, and before you become burned 
out or are in a position where you must sell.
Getting your inn ready to sell
Most inn owners sell their inns at some point. Turning loose something that 
you’ve put so much of yourself into building is an emotional decision; how-
ever, your work doesn’t end once the decision to sell is made. Preparing your 
inn to sell is a crucial process.
Seasoned innkeepers suggest you prepare for the eventual sale of your inn by 
taking the following steps well in advance of when you intend to put your inn 
on the market:
 
1. Prepare an inclusion list (what goes with the sale) and an exclusion 
list (what is not part of the sale).
 
 If possible, start to replace items you don’t want to sell with like items, 
so the exclusion list is short.
 
2. Hire a realtor or broker experienced in selling B&Bs.
 
 See Chapter 4 for a list of bed & breakfast sale specialists, or hire the 
most energetic local realtor you can find and engage the services of an 
inn consultant (see Chapter 3 for B&B consultants).
 
3. Keep your enthusiasm and energy going.
 
 You need to keep your inn running full steam with maximum revenues to 
realize the full value of your business. This includes keeping your adver-
tising and Web site up-to-date.
 
4. Maintain the property and make improvements.
 
 Clean out garden sheds, garages, basements, and closets. Not only will 
an uncluttered inn show better, but you’ll also be getting ready for your 
big move.
It’s not uncommon for inns to take two or three years to sell, but a quick sale 
is also possible, and it’s best to be ready for either contingency.

323
 Chapter 17: Looking into Your Future 
 
Buyers want information. Wow them with your property, your organization, 
and some comprehensive information about your property and the area. Hire 
an inn consultant to prepare a professional evaluation or a for-sale packet 
(see Chapter 3 to find an inn consultant). A thorough evaluation consists of 
35 to 50 or more pages. If you want to assemble the information yourself, see 
Figure 17-1 for an idea of the type of information you should be getting orga-
nized to give to prospective buyers.

Part V: Taking It beyond Breakfast and the Basics 
Deciding what retirement means to you
You should begin planning for your retirement from innkeeping even before 
you purchase your inn. This may sound like strange advice but in doing so 
you’ll be prepared both financially and emotionally for your retirement from 
innkeeping.
From a financial point of view you should talk to a tax attorney, CPA, or 
inn consultant when you set up your business to plan for your retirement 
along the way because selling may entail significant tax consequences. 
Additionally, keeping good financial records from the start will make the pro-
cess of selling your inn and moving on much easier.
Running a bed & breakfast carries many feelings and emotions with it. The 
sentiments associated with devoting considerable energy, passion, and 
time to your B&B means that moving on can be difficult. If your exit strategy 
includes selling the business, picture where you would like to be in the next 
phase of your life, making the transition easier when the time is right.
Fortunately innkeepers’ personalities rarely allow them to do absolutely 
nothing. Whether you’re just starting out or counting the days until your inn 
is sold, think ahead to what you’ll do in retirement. Many innkeepers want to:
 
✓ Travel and spend more time visiting family
 
✓ Become interim innkeepers
 
✓ Stay involved in their communities
 
✓ Relax (on rare occasions)

Ten Cleaning Tips to Save 
Time, Money, and Your Inn
In This Chapter
▶ Using common household products for results that work
▶ Keeping your linens in top form
▶ Waging war on stains
“Life is too short to spend cleaning anymore than absolutely necessary.”
-- Betty Gladden,
Professional Association of Innkeepers International workshop
O
ne common aspect of every successful bed & breakfast is cleanliness. 
All innkeepers share the challenges of saving time and money and effec-
tively maintaining their inns. In this chapter, I give you ten tips and tricks to 
help you win these battles.
 
When making up rooms, carry the tools you need in a cart, a bucket, a basket, 
or a gardening bag with lots of pockets. Basic items to carry along for efficient 
room cleanup and turnover include stain remover, glass cleaner, all-purpose 
cleaner, a dust mop, dust rags (or microfiber cloths), and scissors to cut stray 
strings or threads on towels and bedding.
Putting White Vinegar to Work
White vinegar is a miracle cleaner on glass shower doors, mirrors, vanities, 
and chrome fixtures at the Red Dog Inn in Beaufort, North Carolina. Using vin-
egar cuts way down on fumes and saves money over other cleaning products.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Don’t use white vinegar on tile grout because it will eventually make pits in the 
grout. Instead, spray an all-purpose cleanser with bleach on the grout and let 
it sit a few minutes to kill germs and mildew.
Harnessing the Power of 
Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is great for removing stains without removing color on 
towels, sheets, and even furniture at the Blair Mountain Bed & Breakfast in 
Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. It works wonderfully on blood, ink, and red wine 
stains.
 
Let the hydrogen peroxide soak into the stain briefly, but launder as soon as 
possible.
Getting Rid of Pesky Hair
Nothing is more frustrating than cleaning a bathroom only to turn around 
and find hair that just got pushed around. No matter how much you wipe and 
clean, hair is hard to get rid of. It sticks to everything, including wet rags, and 
then reappears just when you think you’re done cleaning. End the frustra-
tion by vacuuming the bathroom before cleaning it. This will save you a lot of 
time and aggravation; it does at Prairie Creek Inn in Alberta, Canada.
 
Wash and dry your rags after every use to get rid of hair and to keep them 
smelling clean.
Keeping Your Towels in Tip-Top Shape
Guests love fluffy, good-smelling, soft, absorbent towels, so here are some 
tips from The Turkish Towel Company to keep them that way:
 
✓ Never use fabric softener on your towels. It coats the threads and 
makes them nonabsorbent, meaning you’ll have to replace them sooner. 
Instead, add 1 cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle once a month to 
restore your towels to full absorbency.
 
✓ If you catch a thread on a towel and pull a loop, simply cut off the 
pulled loop with a pair of scissors. High-quality towels are woven in 
such a way that a pulled loop won’t cause the towel to unravel.

329
 Chapter 18: Ten Cleaning Tips to Save Time, Money, and Your Inn
Softening Sheets
How many times have your sheets come out of the dryer twisted into a fat, 
wrinkly rope? Never again. By using white vinegar and baking soda as a fabric 
softener, you can foil the culprit behind the mess — static cling. Just follow 
these tips:
 
✓ Add 1/2 cup white vinegar to the wash cycle. The vinegar prevents lint 
from clinging to your linens, and it eliminates chemicals from newly 
manufactured linens.
 
✓ Add 1/4 cup baking soda to the wash cycle. The baking soda lifts dirt for 
extra clean sheets.
 
✓ Add 1/4 cup white vinegar to the last rinse. This dissolves alkali in soaps 
and detergents and prevents yellowing. It also acts as a fabric softener, 
reducing static cling. As an extra benefit, it attacks mold and mildew.
 
Don’t use vinegar on silks, acetates, or rayon.
While I’m on the subject of bedding, here’s a little more advice learned the 
hard way: Use waterproof mattress covers. Protecting your mattresses mini-
mizes damage from bedwetting, spills, menstrual accidents, and bedbugs. 
(Even if you don’t host children at your inn, until you’re an innkeeper you 
might be surprised by how many adults still wet the bed.)
Preventing Clogged Drains
Don’t let your money go needlessly down the drain. Treat your drains 
monthly to guard against a build-up of hair and other debris, and cut down 
on the number of calls you have to make to the plumber.
Mix 1 cup of baking soda with 1 cup of vinegar, and pour the mixture down 
the drain. Let it sit for 5 minutes; then rinse with hot water.
To prevent soap build-up as well as hard water and odors in your dish-
washer, run a cycle with 1 cup of vinegar every month.
Discovering the Miracles of Microfiber
Innkeepers have discovered a secret — they swear by microfiber cleaning 
cloths to clean everything! Save money and your health by forgoing expen-
sive chemical cleaning products. Microfiber cloths miraculously pick up dust 

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
and dirt — rather than just pushing it around — and they’re even effective on 
grease and grime. They’re as gentle as they are strong, and they never leave 
streaks, marks, or scratches.
Treating Stains Immediately
Always treat stains as soon as they’re discovered. For example, when you flip 
back the covers to strip the beds, treat any stains immediately with a stick 
or spray. For stains that require more intense treatment before laundering, 
InnStyle (www.innstyle.com), suppliers of linens for bed & breakfast inns, 
recommends writing the type of stain on a piece of masking tape and using it 
to mark the location of a stain. This will ensure the stain is not forgotten and 
make it easier to find and treat it in the laundry area.
Working Wonders on Windows
Use full-strength white vinegar to clean oil, salt, grease, and grime off win-
dows. Wash windows in different directions when cleaning the inside and the 
outside. When you wash the outside of the window using horizontal strokes 
and the inside using vertical strokes it makes it easier for you to see areas 
that you have missed. For regular window cleaning, use 1 cup of white vin-
egar per pail of water and a good squeegee.
Caring for Carpets
Guests will spill things and, yes, also get sick. Cleaning carpets immediately 
minimizes the impact of the problem by getting rid of unpleasant odors and 
making the area useable again.
To treat carpet stains, make a paste using 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 
1/4 cup of salt or baking soda. Rub the paste into the stain. Allow it to dry, and 
then vacuum.
For oily stains, use white vinegar full-strength, rinse with clean water, and 
blot dry. Repeat if necessary.
Use baking soda as a natural deodorizer. Sprinkle it on carpets, let it sit, and 
then vacuum.
 
Buy a carpet cleaner. It may become your new best friend.

Ten Ways to Guarantee 
a Return Guest
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping guests happy
▶ Making guests want to return
W
hen your guests’ stay exceeds their expectations, you’re guaranteed 
a return visit the next time they’re in your area. The secret to keep-
ing guests happy and getting them to return is to do the unexpected, and this 
chapter tells you how.
Making Guests Feel Special
Your guests begin their stay thinking that you are special; after all, they could 
have chosen to stay at any number of places, but they chose your inn. Prove 
them right, and make them feel special in return. There are numerous ways 
to do this, many of which are unique to your inn and your guests. Start with 
the mantra, “It’s all about the guest,” add some personal attention, and take it 
from there. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
 
✓ Give all guests a welcome tour of the inn.
 
✓ Offer assistance with dinner reservations or other arrangements.
 
✓ Greet guests with a short handwritten note and small treat such as a 
plate of cookies or dish with some candies in their room.
 
✓ Thank them for choosing your inn by offering a frequent visitors dis-
count, if you have one. Or simply send them on their way with a few of 
the brownies or muffins that they raved about during their stay, or give 
them a recipe card with a recipe that they inquired about.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Upgrading Upon Arrival
Everyone loves an unexpected upgrade. If you have available rooms, treat 
first-time guests to an upgraded room as an introductory special and return 
guests as a thank you for staying with you again. The cost to you of offering 
an upgrade at check-in is minimal (you have a larger room to clean at check-
out), but the rewards are happy guests who feel special. Because the guests 
are staying in a nicer room, chances are good that they’ll enjoy their stay 
even more. You’re also giving them the opportunity to try out a better room, 
which they may book on a return trip. A win-win for you and the guest.
 
Wait until check-in to upgrade guests. If you upgrade them before check-in, 
you lose the opportunity to sell the better room.
Catering to Your Guests’ Interests
Personal touches differentiate your property from other places your guests 
have stayed, and those that they could choose in the future. When taking 
your guests’ reservation, ask whether this is their first visit to your area and 
what brings them to the region. If they tell you they’re coming for antiquing, 
for instance, put some brochures in their room of popular antique stores that 
you recommend.
Recognizing Repeat Guests
If you discover that certain guests will be making frequent visits to your area, 
think about extra ways to accommodate them so that staying at your inn is 
always their first choice.
 
✓ When parents of freshmen stay with you while they’re settling their son 
or daughter into college, invite their child to breakfast. These parents 
will be visiting again, as will other relatives over the next four years. You 
want them not only to choose your inn, but to tell other parents about 
your inn as well.
 
✓ Area seniors living in small senior-citizen housing may have family 
who are frequent visitors. Extend an invitation to these guests, offer-
ing your common or outdoor areas as comfortable places to visit with 
their relatives.
 
✓ Offer business travelers personal services, such as making reserva-
tions for them, printing their boarding passes, or offering the use of a 
common area for a small meeting.

333
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Guarantee a Return Guest
 
Make notes on guests who stay with you so that you can welcome them back 
warmly on repeat visits. Most reservation software systems give you space to 
do this, or you can record the info manually. Then, when guests visit again, 
you can ask how their son (by name) is doing at the nearby school and know 
he’s a sophomore and a rugby player, for example. If a repeat guest requests 
the same room, identify it as “their room” — frequent return guests love that.
Asking Guests How Their Stay Is Going
Periodically ask your guests how their stay is going and whether they need 
anything. If you inquire about their plans, do so unobtrusively. If they’re 
chatty and open to suggestions, you might offer them insider tips about res-
taurants in the area, ways to avoid lines at attractions, and so on.
Taking Allergies and Special 
Diets Seriously
Treat allergies and special diets as a big deal — not as a big deal to accom-
modate, but in order to reassure the guest that you’ve prepared something 
special. Giving vegetarians more vegetables is not the answer; rather, pre-
pare something extra, such as a tofu scramble, or adjust your menu to make 
it vegetarian. (See Chapter 10 for sample menus that are easily adjustable to 
accommodate vegetarian guests.) Your regular eaters will never know the dif-
ference, but your guest on a special diet will feel very special.
 
The Internet makes it easy to accommodate all types of special diets. Have a 
few easy vegetarian, low-carb, low-fat, and gluten-free recipes handy.
Sending a Welcome E-Mail
Guests love personal attention, and you can start to give it to them before 
they even arrive at your inn. Have a form e-mail prepared that you can 
quickly customize and personalize for each guest’s reservation. Include in 
the e-mail the dates of your guests’ stay, your check-in and check-out times, 
directions to your inn, and any advance reservations that you have made for 
them. You can make the e-mail as simple or as elaborate as you want; it’s the 
welcome that counts, so make it sound personal and not like a routine confir-
mation. Send the e-mail one week before a guest’s visit.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Helping Guests Celebrate
You’ll have many guests visiting to celebrate a special occasion (make sure to 
ask whether this is the case when you take the reservation). Have birthday, 
anniversary, and blank cards graphically designed with pictures of your inn 
on hand. Then when a guest is staying with you over a special occasion, hand-
write a card and have each staff member personally sign it (with their first 
names only). You can also have sparkling cider on ice and champagne glasses 
on a nice tray waiting in the guests’ room — no liquor license is required!
Get a big smile from the unexpected. As an innkeeper, use your creativity and 
do something out of the ordinary. Use your judgment as to how personalized it 
should be. Remember that some people are very private. For example, if a gen-
tleman calls to make a reservation to celebrate an upcoming anniversary, have 
a small bouquet of flowers in the room with a gift of a CD of smooth instrumen-
tal music. Or ask him whether he’d like the same flowers in the room that his 
wife carried in her wedding bouquet (he probably won’t remember what they 
were, so have him send you a picture). This type of endearing experience will 
make the couple want to spend future anniversaries with you, not to mention 
that it’s a wonderful advertisement for your inn every time the story is retold.
Making Sure Your Inn Is at Its Best
This idea may seem obvious, but it’s too important to leave out. If you offer 
a welcoming atmosphere, a firm bed, a clean property, spotless bathrooms, 
and a good breakfast, and if you’re honest in your advertisements and your 
prices are fair, your guests will leave happy and they’ll return.
 
Sleep around … at your inn. Pack a suitcase and stay in your rooms as a 
“guest.” This is a good way to determine whether something is missing, 
whether storage space and hangers are sufficient, and whether the beds are 
comfortable. Over time, do this for every guest room.
Leaving a Good Last Impression
Personally shake hands (or, in the right situations, give a hug) and look your 
guests in the eye while thanking them for selecting your property. Send a 
follow-up note after their visit expressing your wish that they return (use the 
e-mail address that you sent the confirmation to, not a mailing address).
 
For guests who must leave early in the morning before normal breakfast 
service, offer a simple to-go breakfast if you can’t accommodate their break-
fast time.
