Author’s Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to the team of talented professionals at John Wiley
and Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. Special thanks go
to my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the type of editor that all
authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, skilled, and amazingly
calm in the face of any storm, including my not infrequent freakouts.
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Rashell Smith, Shelley Lea, Steve Hayes, Andy
Cummings, and Mary Bednarek. Thanks, too, to Jonathan Conrad for provid-
ing the awesome nighttime shot for Chapter 7, and to agent extraordinaire,
Margot Maley Hutchison, for her continuing help and encouragement.
Last but oh, so not least, I am deeply indebted to Canon guru Chuck Westfall
for always answering all my questions, even the silly ones; to Scott Heath at
Synergy Communications for his help with this book and various other pro-
jects; and to technical editor Chuck Pace, whose keen eye and vast experi-
ence set me on the right track whenever I mistakenly thought I should go left.
Thank you, thank you, for sharing your time and your expertise — the book
would not have been the same without it.

Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D For Dummies 

Introduction
I
n 2003, when Canon introduced the very first sub-$1000 digital SLR
camera, the EOS Digital Rebel/300D, it revolutionized the camera scene.
For the first time, photography enthusiasts could enjoy the benefits of digital
SLR photography without breaking the bank. And even at the then-unheard-of
price, the camera delivered exceptional performance and picture quality,
earning it rave reviews and multiple industry awards. No wonder it quickly
became a best seller.
That tradition of excellence and value lives on in the EOS Digital Rebel
XSi/450D, known in most circles (and in this book) as simply the Rebel
XSi/450D. For an even lower price than its older brother, this baby offers the
range of advanced controls that experienced photographers demand plus an
assortment of tools designed to help beginners to be successful as well.
If you count yourself among the latter camp, you may have a few questions
about how to take advantage of all the features your camera offers, however.
For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR means or how it affects your
picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the other techie terms you
encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aperture, white balance, file
format, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may be so over-
whelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet ventured
beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame because it’s
sort of like buying a Porsche and never actually taking it on the road.
Therein lies the point of Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D For Dummies:
Through this book, you can discover not just what each bell and whistle on
your camera does, but also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use.
Unlike many photography books, this one doesn’t require any previous
knowledge of photography or digital imaging to make sense of things, either.
In classic For Dummies style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand
language, with lots of illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Canon picture-taking
powerhouse. Whether your interests lie in taking family photos, exploring
nature and travel photography, or snapping product shots for your business,
you’ll get the information you need to capture the images you envision.
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make

2
Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D For Dummies 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your
Rebel XSi/450D:
 Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and
customization steps.
 Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to get
the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure
modes, including Portrait, Sports, and Landscape modes.
 Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality,” introduces you to one setting
that’s critical whether you shoot in automatic or manual mode: the
Quality setting, which affects resolution (pixel count), file format, file
size, and picture quality.
 Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting,”
explains how to review your pictures on the camera monitor, delete
unwanted images, and protect your favorites from accidental erasure.
In addition, this chapter introduces you to Live View shooting, in which
you can use your monitor as a viewfinder.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your camera
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the all-
important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three criti-
cal exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chapter
also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP), explains exposure options such as metering mode and expo-
sure compensation, and offers tips for using the built-in flash.
 Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Look here for information about your
camera’s automatic and manual focusing features as well as details about
color controls such as white balance and the Picture Style options.

 Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results for
specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes,
close-ups, and more.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos,”
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage
device. Just as important, this chapter explains how to organize and
safeguard your photo files. 
 Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Photos,” helps you turn your digi-
tal files into “hard copies,” covering both retail and do-it-yourself print-
ing options. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for
online sharing and, for times when you have the neighbors over, how to
display your pictures on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 Chapter 10, “Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks,” shows you how to fix less-
than-perfect images using the free software provided with your camera.
You can find out how to remove red-eye, adjust color and exposure, crop
your photo, and more.
 Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,”
presents information about some camera features that, while not found
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My Rebel XSi/450D” lists, are
nonetheless interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large,
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
3
Introduction

4
Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D For Dummies 
 A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or
some other valuable resource, including your sanity.
 When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone
that can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
 Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photog-
raphy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this
icon.
 I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth
storing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that
may have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
Additionally, I need to point out two other details that will help you use this
book:
 Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons, dials,
controls, and menu graphics also appear in the margins of some para-
graphs. I include these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of
the button or option being discussed. 
If the information you see on your camera menus and other displays
isn’t the same as what you see in this book, and you’ve explored other
reasons for the discrepancy, a firmware update may be the issue.
Firmware is the camera’s internal software; Chapter 1 shows you how to
check which version your camera is running. This book was written
using version 1.0.4 of the firmware, which was the most current at the
time of publication. You can check the Canon Web site
(www.canon.com) to find out whether any updates are available.
Firmware updates typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re
mostly used to solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you
do download an update, be sure to read the accompanying description
of what it accomplishes so that you can adapt my instructions as neces-
sary. (Again, changes that affect how you actually operate the camera
should be minimal, if any.) 
 Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series of
words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose
File➪Print,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the Print com-
mand on the menu.

About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and editing
tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file
downloading, organizing, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Canon EOS
Utility along with Canon ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows users) and
ImageBrowser (for Mac users). These programs are part of the free software
suite that ships with your camera.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in these programs work very simi-
larly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the steps to
whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your software
manual for details, of course.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that digi-
tal photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very good
company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take it
slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time,
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book.
Your Rebel XSi/450D is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and
I thank you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

M
aking sense of all the controls on your
Rebel XSi/450D isn’t something you can 
do in an afternoon — or, heck, in a week, or maybe
even a month. But that doesn’t mean that you
can’t take great pictures today. By using your
camera’s point-and-shoot automatic modes, you
can capture terriﬁc images with very little effort.
All you have to do is compose the scene, and the
camera takes care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage
of your camera’s automatic features and also
addresses some basic setup steps, such as 
adjusting the viewﬁnder to your eyesight and 
getting familiar with the camera menus, buttons,
and dials. In addition, chapters in this part 
explain how to obtain the very best picture 
quality, whether you shoot in an automatic or
manual mode, how to use your camera’s 
picture-playback features, and how to take 
advantage of Live View shooting.

still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot camera,
but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy sported several
unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the explanations in the camera
manual clearly were written for someone with an engineering
degree. And then there was the whole business of attach-
ing the lens to the camera, an entirely new task for me.
I saved up my pennies a long time for that camera —
what if my inexperience caused me to damage the
thing before I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Rebel
XSi/450D is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. If
your Canon is both your first SLR and first digital
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as compli-
cated as its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the
help of this chapter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll
quickly become as comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you
are with the ones on your car’s dashboard.

This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using an
SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, and navigating your camera’s
internal menus. Finally, the end of the chapter walks you through options
that enable you to customize many aspects of your camera’s basic operation.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to a
super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism. 
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next three
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Your camera can accept two categories of Canon lenses: those with a so-
called EF-S design and those with a plain-old EF design.
The EF stands for electro focus; the S, for short back focus. And no, you don’t
really need to remember that little detail — but you do need to make sure
that if you buy a Canon lens other than the one sold with the camera, it car-
ries either the EF or EF-S specification. (If you want to buy a non-Canon lens,
check the lens manufacturer’s Web site to find out which lenses work with
the Rebel XSi/450D.)
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera
body:
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
3. Locate the proper lens mounting index on the camera body.
A mounting index is simply a marker that tells you where to align the
lens with the camera body when connecting the two. Your camera has
two of these markers, one red and one white, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Which marker you use to align your lens depends on the lens type:
• Canon EF-S lens: Align the lens mounting index with the white
square on the camera body.
• Canon EF lens: Align the lens mounting index with the red dot
instead.
Figure 1-1: Which index marker you should use depends on the lens type.
If you buy a non-Canon lens, check the lens manual for help with this step.
4. Align the mounting index on the lens with the correct one on the
camera body.
The lens also has a mounting index; Figure 1-2 shows the one that
appears on the so-called “kit lens” — the EF-S 18–55mm IS (image stabi-
lizer) zoom lens that Canon sells as a unit with the Rebel XSi/450D. If you
buy a different lens, the index marker on the lens may be red or some
other color, so again, check the lens instruction manual.

Figure 1-2: Place the lens in the lens mount with the mounting indexes aligned.
5. Keeping the mounting indexes aligned, position the lens on the
camera’s lens mount.
When you do so, grip the lens by its back collar as shown in the figure.
6. Turn the lens in a clockwise direction until the lens clicks into place.
In other words, turn the lens toward the lens release button (see
Figure 1-1), as indicated by the red arrow in Figure 1-2. 
7. On a lens that has an aperture ring, set and lock the ring so the aper-
ture is set at the highest f-number.
Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aper-
ture ring and how to adjust it. (The Rebel XSi/450D kit lens doesn’t.)
To find out more about apertures and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
Always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk
of getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens.
Changing lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added
safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver,
as shown in the figure; doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from
being drawn into the camera by gravity. See Chapter 3 for tips on cleaning
your lens.

Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
1. Locate the lens-release button on the front of the camera.
I labeled the button in Figure 1-1.
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
In other words, hold onto the stationary part of the lens that’s closest to
the camera body.
3. Press the lens-release button while turning the lens away from the
lens-release button.
You should feel the lens release from the mount at this point. Just lift the
lens off the mount to remove it.
4. Place the rear protective cap onto the back of the lens.
If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.
Using an IS (image stabilizer) lens
If you purchased the Rebel XSi/450D camera kit — that is, the body-and-lens
combination put together by Canon — your lens offers a feature called image
stabilization. On Canon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials IS in the
lens name.
Image stabilization attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That
camera movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although
image stabilization can’t work miracles, it does enable most people to cap-
ture sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.
However, when you use a tripod, image stabilization can have detrimental
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually
occurring. Although this problem shouldn’t be an issue with most Canon IS
lenses, if you do see blurry images while using a tripod, try setting the
Stabilizer On/Off switch (shown in Figure 1-3) to Off. You also can save battery
power by turning off image stabilization when you use a tripod. (Note that
blurry images can result from causes other than camera shake; see Chapter 6
for help.)
If you use a non-Canon lens, the image stabilization feature may go by another
name: anti-shake, vibration compensation, and so on. In some cases, the manu-
facturers may recommend that you leave the system turned on or select a
special setting when you use a tripod, so be sure to check the lens manual for
information.

Figure 1-3: Set the focusing switch to MF before turning the manual focus ring.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation
of shutter speed.
Focusing and zooming the lens
Like any modern camera, digital or film, yours offers autofocusing capabili-
ties, which you can explore in detail in Chapters 2 and 6. But with some sub-
jects, autofocusing can be slow or impossible, which is why your camera also
offers manual focusing. The process is quick and easy: You just turn the
focusing ring on the lens until your subject comes into focus. To try it out,
take these steps:
Focusing ring
Zoom barrel
Focal length indicator
Auto/Manual focus switch
Image Stabilizer On/Off

1. Locate the AF/MF switch on the side of the lens.
Figure 1-3 shows you the switch as it appears on the Rebel XSi/450D kit
lens. The switch should be in a similar location on other Canon lenses; if
you use a lens from another manufacturer, check the lens instruction
manual.
2. Set the switch to the MF position, as shown in the figure.
Don’t try to move the focusing ring with the switch set to the AF (auto-
focus) position; with some lenses, doing so can damage the lens.
3. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to adjust
focus.
The focusing ring is at the far end of the lens barrel, as indicated in
Figure 1-3.
If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every
lens has a minimum focusing distance. (See Chapter 6 for more tips on
focus issues.) You may also need to adjust the viewfinder to accommo-
date your eyesight; see the next section for details.
If you bought a zoom lens, a movable zoom barrel lies behind the focusing
ring, as shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, just move that zoom barrel
forward and backward.
The numbers on the zoom barrel, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the white focal-length
indicator, labeled in Figure 1-3, represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3,
for example, the focal length is 18mm.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Perched on the top right edge of the viewfinder is a tiny black knob, officially
called the dioptric adjustment control. I labeled the knob in Figure 1-4. With
this control, you can adjust the magnification of the viewfinder to mesh with
your eyesight.
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out-of-focus through the
viewfinder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa.
15
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

16
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 1-4: Use the dioptric adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the focusing screen
shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
The focusing screen is the collective name assigned to the group of nine
autofocus points that appear in the viewfinder — the little squares with
the dots inside. I labeled one of the little guys in Figure 1-4. (The circle
that surrounds the center autofocus point is related to exposure meter-
ing, a subject you can explore in Chapter 5.)
3. Rotate the dioptric adjustment knob until the autofocus points appear
to be in focus.
Don’t worry about focusing the actual picture now; just pay attention to
the autofocus points.
If your eyesight is such that you can’t get the autofocus points to appear
sharp by using the dioptric adjustment control, you can buy an additional
eyepiece adapter. This accessory, which you pop onto the eyepiece, just
enables further adjustment of the viewfinder display. Prices range from about
$15–30 depending on the magnification you need. Look for an adapter called
an E-series dioptric adjustment lens.
One other note about the viewfinder: See that little black window underneath
the viewfinder — the one labeled Display Off sensor in Figure 1-4? When you
put your eye up to the viewfinder, the sensor tells the camera to turn off the
Dioptric adjustment knob

monitor display, saving you the trouble of doing the job yourself. If the moni-
tor doesn’t turn off automatically, the upcoming section “Setup Menu 1” tells
you how to fix things; see the information related to the LCD Auto Off feature.
Keep in mind, too, that with the XSi/450D, you can opt to use the monitor
instead of the viewfinder to frame and preview your shots.
Because many of the functions connected with Live View shooting are similar
to those you use during picture playback, I cover both uses of your monitor
together in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 and 6 spell out some additional details of
setting exposure and focusing in Live View mode.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory
cards. Your Rebel XSi/450D uses a specific type of memory card called an SD
card (for Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. Other card types —
CompactFlash, Memory Stick, or any others — aren’t compatible with your
camera. However, if you use SD cards in your cell phone, portable music player,
or other device, you can use the same cards in your camera. Also, your camera
can use the new, high-capacity SD cards, which carry the label SDHC, as well
as plain old SD cards.
Figure 1-5: Insert the card with the label facing the camera back.

Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them —
requires just a few precautions:
 Inserting a card: First, be sure that the camera is turned off. Then put
the card in the card slot with the label facing the back of the camera, as
shown in Figure 1-5. Push the card into the slot until it clicks into place.
 Formatting a card: The first time you use a new memory card, take a few
seconds to format it by choosing the Format option on Setup Menu 1.
This step simply ensures that the card is properly prepared to record
your pictures. See the upcoming section “Setup Menu 1” for details.
 Removing a card: First, check the status of the memory card access
light, labeled in Figure 1-5. After making sure that the light is off, indicat-
ing that the camera has finished recording your most recent photo, turn
the camera off. Open the memory card door, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Depress the memory card slightly until you hear a little click and then
let go. The card should pop halfway out of the slot, enabling you to grab
it by the tail and remove it.
 Handling cards: Don’t touch
the gold contacts on the back
of the card. (See the left card in
Figure 1-6.) When cards aren’t
in use, store them in the protec-
tive cases they came in or in a
memory card wallet. Keep
cards away from extreme heat
and cold as well.
 Locking cards: The tiny switch
on the left side of the card,
labeled lock switch in Figure 1-6,
enables you to lock your card,
which prevents any data from
being erased or recorded to the
card. Press the switch toward
the bottom of the card to lock
the card contents; press it
toward the top of the card to
unlock the data.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your
photos, and perform various other operations. 
Lock switch
Paws off!
Figure 1-6: Avoid touching the gold contacts on
the card.

In later chapters, I discuss all of your camera’s functions in detail and provide
the exact steps to follow to access those functions. This section provides just
a basic road map to the external controls plus a quick introduction to each.
You may want to put a sticky note or other bookmark on this page so that
you can find it for easier reference later. (The cheat sheet at the front of the
book offers a similar guide, albeit with less detail.)
With that preamble out of the way, the next three sections break down the
external controls found on the top, back, and front-left side of the camera.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins on the top-right side of the camera, shown in Figure 1-7.
There are six items of note here, as follows:
 On/Off switch: Okay, I’m pretty sure you already figured this one out,
but just move the switch to On to fire up the camera and then back to
Off to shut it down.
By default, the camera automatically shuts itself off after 30 seconds of
inactivity to save battery power. To wake up the camera, just press the
shutter button halfway; you don’t need to use the On/Off switch. You can
adjust the auto shutdown timing via Setup Menu 1, covered later in this
chapter.
 Mode dial: Rotate this dial to select an exposure mode, which deter-
mines whether the camera operates in fully automatic, semi-automatic,
or manual exposure mode. The little pictographs, or icons, on the dial
represent Image Zone modes, which are automatic settings geared to
specific types of photos: action shots, portraits, landscapes, and so on.
Canon uses the term Basic Zone to refer collectively to the Image Zone
modes and Full Auto mode. (That’s the one represented by the green
rectangle on the Mode dial.) The more advanced modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP) get the label Creative Zone. I think that having all those
zones can be a little confusing, especially because the modes in the
Image Zone category are often referred to generically in photography
discussions as creative scene mode or creative modes. So, just to help
keep things a little simpler in this book, I use the generic terms fully auto-
matic exposure modes to refer to all the Basic Zone modes and advanced
exposure modes to refer to the Creative Zone modes. And note that none
of the exposure modes affect focusing; you can use autofocus or manual
focus in any of the exposure modes, as outlined earlier in this chapter.
 Main dial: Just forward of the Mode dial, you see a black dial that has
the official name Main dial. This dial plays such an important role in
choosing camera settings that you’d think it might have a more auspi-
cious name, but Main dial it is. 
19
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

20
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 ISO button: You use this
button, in conjunction with
the Main dial, to adjust the
camera’s ISO speed, which
determines how sensitive
the camera is to light.
Chapter 5 details this criti-
cal exposure setting.
 Shutter button: You proba-
bly already understand the
function of this button, too.
But check out Chapter 2 to
discover the proper shutter-
button-pressing technique —
you’d be surprised how
many people mess up their
pictures because they press
that button incorrectly.
 Red-Eye Reduction/Self-
Timer Lamp: When you 
set your flash to Red-Eye
Reduction mode, this little
lamp emits a brief beam 
of light prior to the real
flash — the idea being that
your subjects’ pupils will
constrict in response to the
light, thus lessening the chances of red-eye. If you use the camera’s self-
timer feature, the lamp blinks to provide you with a visual countdown 
to the moment at which the picture will be recorded. See Chapter 2 for
more details about Red-Eye Reduction flash mode and the self-timer
function.
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, you encounter a smor-
gasbord of buttons — 13, in fact, not including the viewfinder’s dioptric
adjustment control, discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 1-8 gives you a
look at the layout of backside controls.
Don’t let the abundance of buttons intimidate you. Having all of those exter-
nal controls actually makes operating your camera easier. On cameras that
have only a few external buttons, you have to dig through menus to access
the camera features, which is a big pain in the keister. But on your camera,
you can access almost every critical shooting setting via the external but-
tons. That’s a convenience you’ll come to appreciate after you familiarize
yourself with all the camera options.

Figure 1-8: Having lots of external buttons makes accessing the camera’s functions easier.
Also, as you look through this book, you may notice that the margins contain
little representations of the buttons to help you locate the one being dis-
cussed. So even though I provide the official control names in the following
list, don’t worry about getting all of those straight right now. The list I pro-
vide here is just to get you acquainted with the possibility of what you can
accomplish with all of these features.
Do note, however, that many of the buttons have multiple names because
they serve multiple purposes depending on whether you’re taking pictures,
reviewing images, or performing some other function. In this book, I refer to
these buttons by the first label you see in the following list just to simplify
things. For example, I refer to the AF Point Selection/Enlarge button as the 
AF Point Selection button. Again, though, the margin icons help you know
exactly which button I’m describing.
And here’s another tip: If the label or icon for a button is blue, it indicates
a function related to viewing, printing, or downloading images. Labels that
indicate a shooting-related function are either black or white, depending on
whether the camera body is silver or black.
21
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
With that preamble out of the way, journey with me now over the camera
back, starting at the top-right corner and working westward (well, assuming
that your lens is pointing north, anyway):
 AF Point Selection/Enlarge button: When you use certain advanced
shooting modes, you use this button to specify which of the nine autofo-
cus points you want the camera to use when establishing focus. Chapter
6 tells you more about this feature. But in Playback mode and in Live
View mode, you use the button to magnify the image display (thus the
plus sign in the button’s magnifying glass icon). See Chapter 4 for help
with that function.
 AE Lock/FE Lock/Index/Reduce button: As you can guess from the offi-
cial name of this button, it serves many purposes. The first two are
related to image capture functions: You use the button to lock in the
autoexposure (AE) settings and to lock flash exposure (FE). Chapter 5
details both issues. Additionally, during Live View shooting, the button
serves as the autofocus and autoexposure trigger, as explained in
Chapter 6.
The button also serves two image-viewing functions: It switches the dis-
play to Index mode, enabling you to see multiple image thumbnails at
once, and it also reduces the magnification of images when viewed in
Single-Picture mode. Again, Chapter 4 explains all these monitor-related
features. 
 Aperture/Exposure Compensation button: When you work in M
(manual) exposure mode, you press this button and rotate the Main dial
to choose the aperture setting, better known as the f-stop. In the other
advanced exposure modes, you instead use the button and dial to adjust
exposure compensation, a feature that enables you to adjust the expo-
sure selected by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. Chapter 5 dis-
cusses both issues.
 White Balance/Print/Share button: Press this button to adjust the
camera’s white balance setting, which is a feature you can use to adjust
image colors. This button is also involved when you transfer images to
your computer or print pictures directly from the camera. See Chapter 6
for details about white balance; check out Chapters 8 and 9 for informa-
tion about image transfer and printing, respectively.
 Set button and cross keys: The Set button and the four surrounding but-
tons, known as cross keys, team up to perform several functions, includ-
ing choosing options from the camera menus. You use the cross keys to
navigate through menus and then press the Set key to select a specific
menu setting. (The later section, “Ordering from Camera Menus,” has
the details.)
In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” just means to press
the one that sports the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up cross key”
means to press the one with the up-pointing arrowhead, and so on. 

The cross keys and the Set button also have individual responsibilities,
as follows: 
• Press the Set button to switch to Live View display. You must first
enable Live View through Setup Menu 2 and select one of the
advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). See the end of
Chapter 4 for details about using Live View.
• Press the right cross key to adjust the AF mode. This option controls
the camera’s autofocus behavior, as outlined in Chapter 6.
• Press the left cross key to change the Drive mode. The Drive mode
settings enable you to switch the camera from single-frame shoot-
ing to continuous capture or self-timer/remote-control shooting.
See Chapter 2 for details.
• Press the down cross key to change the Picture Style. Chapter 6
explains Picture Styles, which you can use to adjust color, contrast,
and sharpness of your pictures.
• Press the up cross key to change the exposure metering mode or to
use the Jump feature during picture playback. The metering mode
determines which area of the frame the camera uses when deter-
mining the correct exposure settings. Chapter 5 has details. The
Jump feature enables you to “fast forward” through your images
during playback; see Chapter 4 for specifics.
You can customize the functions of the Set button; Chapter 11 explains
how. But while you’re working with this book, stick with the default setup,
just described. Otherwise, the instructions I give in the book won’t work.
 Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture
review mode. Chapter 4 details the camera’s playback features.
 Erase button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for delete,
this button lets you erase pictures from your memory card. Chapter 4
has specifics. In Live View mode, also covered in Chapter 4, this button
is involved in the focusing process.
 Menu button: Press this button to access the camera menus. See the
next section for details on navigating menus.
 DISP button: The camera monitor turns on automatically when you
press the shutter button halfway, press the Menu button, or press the
Playback button. When you put your eye up to the viewfinder, the dis-
play automatically turns off. If the monitor doesn’t turn off or on as
expected, press this button to kick it into or out of gear.
But that’s just the start of the DISP button’s tricks. If the camera menus
are displayed, pressing the button takes you to the Camera Functions
display, explained in the upcoming section “Monitoring Critical Camera
Settings.” In Playback mode and Live View mode, pressing the button
changes the picture-display style, as outlined in Chapter 4.

Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, you find three more buttons, all
labeled in Figure 1-9. One, the lens-release button, is key to taking the lens off
the camera body, as discussed earlier in the chapter. The other two buttons
work as follows:
 Flash button: Press this button to bring the camera’s built-in flash out of
hiding when you use the advanced shooting modes. (In fully automatic
modes, the camera pops up the flash without your help if it decides the
flash light is needed.) Chapters 5 and 7 provide tips on flash photography.
 Depth-of-Field Preview button: When you press this button, the image
in the viewfinder offers an approximation of the depth of field that will
result from your selected aperture setting, or f-stop. Depth of field refers
to how much of the scene will be in sharp focus. Chapter 6 provides
details on depth of field, which is an important aspect of your picture
composition. Chapter 5 explains aperture and other exposure settings.

Ordering from Camera Menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, conve-
niently enough, appear when you press the Menu button, located atop the
upper-left corner of the camera monitor. Features are grouped into seven
main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

Table 1-1, each representing one of the seven menus. The icon that is high-
lighted is the active menu; options on that menu automatically appear on the
main part of the screen. In the figure, Shooting Menu 1 is active, for example.

Figure 1-10: Use the cross keys to navigate menus; press Set to access available settings.
Shooting Menu 2, Setup Menu 3, and My Menu do not appear in the menu dis-
play when you set the camera Mode dial to Full Auto or any of the other fully
automatic exposure modes (Portrait, Landscape, Sports, and so on). You see
these menus only when you use the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP). And some menu items on Setup Menu 2 are hidden in the fully
automatic exposure modes.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, just
familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting
options. Here’s the drill:
 To select a different menu: Press the right or left cross keys or rotate
the Main dial to cycle through the available menus.
 To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Press the up or
down cross key to highlight the feature you want to adjust. On the left
side of Figure 1-10, the Quality option is highlighted, for example. Next,
press the Set button. Settings available for the selected item then appear
either right next to the menu item or on a separate screen, as shown on
the right side of the figure. Either way, use the up and down cross keys
to highlight your preferred setting and then press Set again to lock in
your choice.
In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” simply means to
press the cross key to the left of the Set button — the one marked with
the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up cross key” means to press the
cross key on the top side of the Set button, and so on.
Again, I present this information just as a general introduction, so don’t
worry about memorizing it. I tell you exactly which button combos to use
whenever I explain a function that you activate via the menus.

Monitoring Critical Camera Settings
As you advance in your photography and begin to move beyond the auto-
matic exposure modes, you need a way to keep track of what camera settings
are currently active. To that end, your camera offers the Camera Settings dis-
play, shown in Figure 1-11. By default, the display appears automatically
when you turn on the camera and also when you depress the shutter button
halfway — unless your eye is up to the viewfinder. In that case, the display is
automatically turned off, but you can monitor some settings in the
viewfinder, as explained in the next section. You also can turn the monitor
display on and off by pressing the DISP button when no menus are active.
In Figure 1-11, you see an example of the settings that you can monitor in the
advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). In fully automatic
modes, many of the settings are hidden to make the display simpler. Either
way, if what you see looks like a big confusing mess to you now, don’t worry.
Most of it won’t mean anything to you until you make your way through later
chapters and explore all of the camera controls.
The figure does label two key points of data that are helpful even in fully
automatic modes, though: how many more pictures can fit on your memory
card at the current settings and the status of the battery. A “full” battery icon
like the one in the figure shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon
appears empty, go look for your battery charger.

In addition to the Camera Settings display, you can activate the Camera
Function Settings display, shown in Figure 1-12. To display this screen, first
display the camera menus by pressing the Menu button. Then press the DISP
button.
Again, the items listed on the screen
in the figure appear in the advanced
exposure modes. The following list
explains the settings that you can
monitor, detailed from top to bottom
in the order they appear on the
screen. (The last three lines of the
screen each display icons represent-
ing two different settings.)
 Freespace: This value indicates
how much storage space is left
on your current camera memory
card. How many pictures you can
fit into that space depends on the
Quality setting you select. Chapter 3 explains this issue.
 Color Space: This value tells you whether the camera is currently cap-
turing images in the sRGB or Adobe RGB color space, an advanced
option that you can investigate in Chapter 6.
 White Balance Shift/Bracketing: Add this to the list of advanced color
options covered in Chapter 6.
 Live View Shooting: Chapter 4 details this feature, which enables you to
use your monitor instead of the viewfinder to compose your shots.
 Auto Sensor Cleaning and Red-Eye Reduction flash mode: See “Setup
Menu 2,” later in this chapter, for more about automatic sensor cleaning;
check out Chapter 2 for information about red-eye reduction flash.
 Auto Power Off and Auto Rotate Display: For information on both
options, see the upcoming section, “Setup Menu 1.”
 Beep and LCD Auto Off: The first setting determines whether the
camera beeps at you after certain operations; you can adjust the setting
via Shooting Menu 1, as explained later in this chapter. The second set-
ting, covered in the section “Setup Menu 1,” controls whether the moni-
tor turns off automatically when you put your eye to the viewfinder.
 Date/Time: The section “Setup Menu 2” also explains how to adjust the
date and time.
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the Color Space, White Balance
Shift/Bracketing, and Live View Shooting status information doesn’t appear in
this screen because you can’t use those features unless you switch to an
advanced exposure mode.
Figure 1-12: Press the DISP button when the
menus are active to view this screen.

Of course, with the exception of the free card space value, you also can simply go
to the menu that contains the option in question to check its current status. The
Camera Settings display and Camera Function Settings display just give you a quick
way to monitor some of the critical functions without hunting through menus.
In addition, if you switch to Live View shooting, you also can display some of
the same settings in the monitor preview, along with your image. Chapter 4,
which introduces Live View shooting, shows you how to do so.
Decoding Viewfinder Data
When the camera is turned on, you can view critical exposure settings and a
few other pieces of information in the viewfinder as well as in the Camera
Settings display. Just put your eye to the viewfinder and press the shutter
button halfway to activate the display. You can then either release the shutter
button or keep the button pressed to initiate autofocusing. (I’m assuming
that Live View mode, in which you use the monitor as viewfinder, is disabled,
as it is by default. See Chapter 4 if you want more details about Live View.)
The viewfinder data changes depending on what action you’re currently
undertaking and what exposure mode you’re using. For example, if you set the
Mode dial to P (for programmed autoexposure), you see the current f-stop
(aperture setting), shutter speed, the current Exposure Compensation setting,
and ISO setting, as shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-13: You also can view some camera information at the bottom of the viewfinder.

Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land

30
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The final value (9, in the figure) shows you the number of maximum burst
frames. This number relates to shooting in the Continuous-capture mode,
where the camera fires off multiple shots in rapid-fire succession as long as
you hold down the shutter button. (Chapter 2 has details on this mode.) Note
that although the highest number that the viewfinder can display is 9, the
actual number of maximum burst frames may be higher. At any rate, you
don’t really need to pay attention to the number until it starts dropping
toward 0, which indicates that the camera’s memory buffer (its temporary
internal data-storage tank) is filling up. If that happens, just give the camera
a moment to catch up with your shutter-button finger.
Rather than give you a full guide to all the possible viewfinder readouts here,
which would only boggle your mind and cause lots of unnecessary page-
flipping, I detail the relevant viewfinder data as I cover the various photo-
graphic topics later in the book.
Reviewing Basic Setup Options
You know how sometimes you visit someone’s house and their kitchen cabi-
nets are arranged in a way that doesn’t make sense to you? Why are the mugs
above the microwave instead of above the coffeepot? And wouldn’t it be
better if the serving spoons were next to the stove instead of by the dish-
washer? That’s how I feel about the way that settings that relate to basic
camera setup are organized on the camera menus. They surely make sense to
somebody — namely, I’m guessing, the important somebodies at Canon. But
to me, a couple of the basic setup options are out of place, found on menus
other than Setup Menus 1, 2, or 3, where you might expect to find them. And
Setup Menus 2 and 3 offer some options that are related more to advanced
photographic controls than basic camera operation.
Well, I can’t rearrange the menus for you any more than I can put those mugs
near the coffeemaker, so instead, the following sections describe the options
found on the aforementioned trio of Setup Menus, plus two additional
options found on Shooting Menu 1.
If you don’t yet know how to select options from the menus, see the earlier
section, “Ordering from Camera Menus” for help.
In case you haven’t noticed, the icons that represent the menus are color
coded. Shooting Menus 1 and 2 have red icons; Setup Menus 1, 2, and 3 sport
yellow icons; the Playback menu has a blue symbol; and the My Menus icon
is green. 

Setup Menu 1
At the risk of being labeled conventional, I suggest that you start your camera
customization by opening this menu, shown in Figure 1-14.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu
item:
 Auto Power Off: To help save
battery power, your camera auto-
matically powers down after a
certain period of inactivity. By
default, the shutdown happens
after 30 seconds, but you can
change the shutdown delay to 1,
2, 4, 8, or 15 minutes. Or you can
disable auto shutdown altogether
by selecting the Off setting.
 File Numbering: This option con-
trols how the camera names your
picture files. When the option is set to Continuous, as it is by default, the
camera numbers your files sequentially, from 0001 to 9999, and places all
images in the same folder. The initial folder name is 100Canon; when you
reach image 9999, the camera creates a new folder, named 101Canon, for
your next 9999 photos. This numbering sequence is retained even if you
change memory cards, which helps to ensure that you don’t wind up
with multiple images that have the same file name.
By contrast, the Auto Reset option automatically starts file numbering at
0001 each time you put in a different memory card. I discourage the use
of this option, for the reason already stated.
Whichever of these two options you choose, beware one gotcha: If you
swap out memory cards and the new card already contains images, the
camera may pick up numbering from the last image on the new card,
which throws a monkey wrench into things. To avoid this problem, just
format the new card before putting it into the camera. (See the upcom-
ing Format bullet point for details.)
Finally, if you choose Manual Reset, the camera begins a new numbering
sequence, starting at 0001, for your next shot. The Continuous mode is
then automatically selected for you again.
 Auto Rotate: If you enable this feature, your picture files include a piece
of data that indicates whether the camera was oriented in the vertical or
horizontal position when you shot the frame. Then, when you view the
picture on the camera monitor or on your computer, the image is auto-
matically rotated to the correct orientation.
31
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-14: Options on Setup Menu 1 deal
mainly with basic camera behavior.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To automatically rotate images both in the camera monitor and on your
computer monitor, stick with the default setting. In the menu, this set-
ting is represented by On followed by a camera icon and a monitor icon,
as shown in Figure 1-14. If you want the rotation to occur just on your
computer and not on the camera, select the second On setting, which is
marked with the computer monitor symbol but not the camera symbol.
To disable rotation for both devices, choose the Off setting.
Note, though, that the camera may record the wrong orientation data for
pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up or down.
Also, whether your computer can read the rotation data in the picture
file depends on the software you use; the programs bundled with the
camera can perform the auto rotation.
 Format: The first time you insert a new memory card, you should use
this option to format the card, a maintenance function that wipes out
any existing data on the card and prepares it for use by the camera.
If you previously used your card in another device, such as a digital
music player, be sure to copy those files to your computer before you
format the card.
When you choose the Format option from the menu, you can opt to per-
form a normal card formatting process or a low-level formatting. The
latter gives your memory card a deeper level of cleansing than ordinary
formatting and thus takes longer to perform. Normally, a regular format-
ting will do.
 LCD Auto Off: When the Enable setting is selected, as it is by default,
the camera automatically turns off the camera monitor when you put
your eye up to the camera viewfinder. (The little sensor underneath the
viewfinder notes the presence of your eye and signals the camera to
turn off the monitor.) You can deactivate this feature by choosing the
Disable setting if you prefer. The monitor is one of the biggest battery
drains on the camera, however, so in my opinion, the auto shutoff fea-
ture is a good thing.
 Screen Color: If you don’t like the default background color of the
Camera Settings display, you can choose from three other color schemes
via this menu option. For this book, I use the default color scheme,
which is option 1.
Setup Menu 2
Setup Menu 2, shown in Figure 1-15, offers an additional batch of customiza-
tion options. But you can take advantage of only the following options in all
exposure modes (Full Auto, Manual, Portrait, and so on):

 LCD Brightness: This option
enables you to make the camera
monitor brighter or darker. After
highlighting the option on the
menu, as shown in Figure 1-15,
press Set to display a screen simi-
lar to what you see in Figure 1-16.
The camera displays a picture
from your memory card in the
main preview area; if the card is
empty, you see a black box
instead. Press the right and left
cross keys to adjust the bright-
ness setting. Press Set again to
return to the menu.
If you take this step, keep in mind
that what you see on the display may not be an accurate rendition of the
actual exposure of your image. Crank up the monitor brightness, for
example, and an underexposed photo may look just fine. So I recom-
mend that you keep the brightness at the default setting, which places
the brightness marker at dead center on the little brightness scale, as
shown in Figure 1-15. As an alternative, you can display the histogram, an
exposure guide that I explain in Chapter 4, when reviewing your images.
 Date/Time: When you turn on your camera for the very first time, it
automatically displays this option and asks you to set the current date
and time.
Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that information is
recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, you can then
see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for images by
the date they were taken. Chapter 8 shows you where to locate the
date/time data when browsing your picture files.
 Language: This option determines the language of any text displayed on
the camera monitor. Screens in this book display the English language,
but I find it entertaining on occasion to hand my camera to a friend after
changing the language to, say, Swedish. I’m a real yokester, yah?
 Video System: This option is related to viewing your images on a televi-
sion, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard;
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
That leaves the following menu options, which you can’t access (or access
fully) unless you switch to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP):
33
Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-15: Most options on Setup Menu 2
can be used only in advanced exposure
modes.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Sensor Cleaning: By default, the
camera’s sensor-cleaning mecha-
nism activates each time you turn
the camera on and off. This
process helps keep the image
sensor — which is the part of the
camera that captures the image —
free of dust and other particles
that can mar your photos.
In the fully automatic modes, you
have the option of turning the fea-
ture off, but I can’t imagine why
you would choose to do so. You
can also initiate a cleaning cycle
via this menu option at any time.
In the advanced exposure modes, you can access a third option that pre-
pares the camera for manual cleaning of the sensor. I don’t recommend
this practice; sensors are delicate, and you’re really better off taking the
camera to a good service center for cleaning. 
 Live View Functions: This part of the menu enables you to enable Live
View mode, in which you can preview your shots in the monitor, and 
to customize a couple of aspects of how the camera behaves in that
mode. Chapter 4 explains your options. (By default, Live View shooting
is disabled.)
 Flash Control: Here’s where you customize certain aspects of how your
flash behaves. Chapter 5 provides details on flash photography.
Setup Menu 3
This menu, shown in Figure 1-17, con-
tains the following offerings, which
you can access only in the advanced
exposure modes. Again, those modes
are P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. Chapter 5
introduces you to each mode.
 Custom Functions: Selecting this
option opens the door to cus-
tomizing 13 camera functions,
known as Custom Functions in
Canon lingo. These functions
either relate to advanced expo-
sure options or are otherwise
designed for people with some
photography experience. Check
the index to find out where to locate details about the various functions.
Figure 1-17: To display Setup Menu 3, you
must set the Mode dial to an advanced
exposure mode.
Figure 1-16: You can adjust the brightness of
the camera monitor.

 Clear Settings: Via this menu option, you can restore the default shoot-
ing settings that are used for the advanced exposure modes. You also
can reset all the Custom Functions settings to their defaults through this
option.
 Firmware Ver.: This screen tells you the current version of the camera
firmware (internal operating software). At the time of publication, the
current firmware version was 1.0.4.
Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the
Canon Web site (www.canon.com) regularly to find out whether your
camera sports the latest version. The site provides instructions on how
to download and install updated firmware if necessary.
Three more customization options
Shooting Menu 1, shown in Figure 1-18, offers two more basic setup options —
at least, these options fall into that category if you share my logic, which
some may consider a frightening prospect. At any rate, these two options
work as follows:
 Beep: By default, your camera
beeps at you after certain opera-
tions, such as after it sets focus
when you shoot in Autofocus
mode. If you’re doing top-secret
surveillance work and need the
camera to hush up, set this
option to Off.
 Shoot w/o Card: Setting this
option to Off prevents shutter-
button release when no memory
card is in the camera. If you turn
the option on, you can take a pic-
ture and then review the results
for a few seconds in the camera
monitor. The image isn’t stored anywhere, however; it’s temporary.
If you’re wondering about the point of this option, it’s designed for use
in camera stores, enabling salespeople to demonstrate cameras without
having to keep a memory card in every model. Unless that feature some-
how suits your purposes, keep this option set to Off.
Adding a final level of customization choices, the My Menu feature does just
what its name implies: You can create a personalized menu that contains up
to six functions from the existing menus. Then, instead of hunting through all
the other menus to find settings that you use frequently, you can access the
settings quickly just by displaying My Menu. Chapter 11 shows you how to
take advantage of this feature, which I happen to love a lot. Unfortunately,
you can take advantage of My Menu only in the advanced exposure modes.

Why does this camera have two names?
As is the case with some other Canon cameras,
yours goes by different names — EOS Digital
Rebel XSi or EOS 450D — depending on the part
of the world where it’s sold.
The EOS part, by the way, stands for Electro
Optical System, the core technology used in
Canon’s autofocus SLR (single-lens reflex) 
cameras. According to Canon, the proper 
pronunciation is ee-ohs, which is also how you
pronounce the name Eos, the goddess of dawn
in Greek mythology.
With apologies to the goddess, I save a little
room in this book by shortening the camera
name to simply Rebel XSi/450D, which is already
long enough.

A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television commercials
from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” declared one
actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. Then a narrator
declared the debate a tie and spoke the famous catch-
phrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Rebel XSi/450D. On
one hand, it provides a full range of powerful con-
trols, offering just about every feature a serious pho-
tographer could want. On the other, it also offers
fully automated exposure modes that enable people
with absolutely no experience to capture beautiful
images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” “It’s
as easy as ‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two, two cam-
eras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with
your camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters
cover. This chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side.
Even when you shoot in the fully automatic modes, following a few basic
guidelines can help you get better results. For example, your camera offers a
variety of fully automatic exposure modes, some of which may be new to you.

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chapter explains those
options. I also cover techniques that enable you to get the best performance
from your camera’s autofocus and autoexposure systems and review the
flash options and Drive mode settings available to you in automatic modes.
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your camera offers several fully automatic exposure modes, all of which
I explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good
photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Full Auto, as shown in
the left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the AF
(autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. (The figure
features the lens that is bundled with the Rebel XSi/450D. If you own a differ-
ent lens, the switch may look and operate differently; check your lens manual
for details.)
Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the Stabilizer switch to the On setting,
as shown in Figure 2-1. This setting turns on the Image Stabilizer feature,
which is designed to produce sharper images by compensating for camera
movement that can occur when you handhold the camera. Again, if you use a
lens other than the kit lens, check your lens manual for details about using its
stabilization feature, if provided.
Full Auto mode
Auto/Manual focus switch
Image Stabilizer switch

Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture:
1. Looking through the viewfinder, frame the image so that your subject
appears under an autofocus point.
The autofocus points are those nine tiny rectangles clustered in the
center of the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: The tiny rectangles in the viewfinder indicate autofocus points.
2. Press and hold the shutter button halfway down.
The camera’s autofocus and autoexposure meters begin to do their
thing. In dim light, the flash may pop up if the camera thinks additional
light is needed. Additionally, the flash may shoot out an AF-assist beam,
emitting a few rapid pulses of light designed to help the autofocusing
mechanism find its target. (The AF stands for autofocus.)
At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two critical
exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; in
Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/250 second and the f-stop is f/5.6. You
also see the current ISO setting and the maximum burst rate. (Chapter 5
details shutter speed, f-stops, and ISO; see Chapter 1 for information
about the maximum burst rate value.)

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
When focus is established, the camera beeps at you, assuming that you
didn’t silence its voice via Shooting Menu 1, as discussed at the end of
Chapter 1. Additionally, the focus indicator in the viewfinder lights, as
shown in Figure 2-3, and the dot inside an autofocus point starts to blink
red. That blinking dot indicates which autofocus point the camera used
to establish focus. Sometimes multiple dots blink, as in Figure 2-3, which
simply tells you that all the objects within those autofocus areas are
now in focus. The autoexposure meter continues monitoring the light up
to the time you take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed values
in the viewfinder may change if the light shifts. 
Figure 2-3: The green light indicates that the camera has locked focus.
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, the
memory card access lamp lights, as shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off
the camera or remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may
damage both camera and card.
When the recording process is finished, the picture appears briefly on
the camera monitor. By default, the review period is two seconds. See
Chapter 4 to find out how to adjust or disable the instant review and
how to switch to Playback mode and take a longer look at your image.
Active autofocus point
Focus indicator light

I need to add a couple important
notes about this process, especially
related to Step 2:
 Solving autofocus problems:
When you shoot in the fully
automatic modes, the camera
typically focuses on the closest
object. If the camera insists on
selecting an autofocus point
that isn’t appropriate for your
subject, the easiest solution is
to switch to manual focusing
and be done with it. Chapter 1
shows you how. Or you can use
the advanced exposure modes,
which enable you to select a
specific autofocus point.
Chapter 6 explains that option
plus a few other tips for getting
good autofocus results.
 Shooting moving subjects: If the focus indicator doesn’t light but you
hear a continuous series of beeps, the camera’s telling you that it
detected motion in the scene. To accommodate that motion, it shifts to
an autofocusing mode called AI Servo. (The AI stands for artificial intelli-
gence.) In this mode, the camera focuses continually after you press the
shutter button halfway. As long as you keep the subject within one of the
autofocus points, focus should be correct. See Chapter 6 for more tips
about this and other autofocus modes.
 Locking exposure: By default, pressing the shutter button halfway does
not lock exposure along with focus. Your camera instead continues meter-
ing and adjusting exposure until you fully depress the shutter button. If
you want to lock exposure, you must use an advanced exposure mode and
rely on the AE (autoexposure) Lock button. You also can simply switch
the camera’s Mode dial to M, which shifts the camera to manual exposure
mode, and then set your desired exposure settings (aperture, shutter
speed, and ISO). Chapter 5 discusses these and other exposure issues.
Alternatively, you can set up the shutter button to lock exposure instead
of focus; Chapter 11 explains this option, available through one of the
Custom Functions. (While working with this book, however, stick with
the default arrangement.)

the camera sends the picture data to the card.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Changing the Drive mode setting: In most of the automatic exposure
modes, your camera automatically sets the Drive mode to Single, which
records a single image with each press of the shutter button. But in
Portrait and Sports modes, the camera instead selects Continuous mode,
which records pictures as long as you hold down the shutter button. You
can change the Drive mode to a Self-Timer or Remote Control setting for
any exposure mode, however. See the end of this chapter for details.
 Shooting in Live View mode: Unfortunately, you can’t use Live View
mode, which enables you to frame your image using the camera monitor
instead of the viewfinder. If you want to take advantage of Live View, you
must switch to an advanced exposure mode. See Chapter 5 for details on
those modes; Chapter 4 provides a primer on Live View shooting.
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus or
manual focus mode, you determine only the
point of sharpest focus. The distance to which
the sharp-focus zone extends from that point —
what photographers call the depth of field —
depends in part on the aperture setting, or 
f-stop, which is an exposure control. Some of
your camera’s fully automatic exposure modes
are designed to choose aperture settings that
produce a certain depth of field.
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so
that background objects are softly focused — an
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape
setting selects an aperture that produces a large
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds,
they appear sharply focused. On your camera,
the Sports shooting mode automatically selects
a high shutter speed to help you “stop” action,
producing blur-free shots of the subject.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard
against allover blurring that results when the
camera is moved during the exposure. The faster
the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure time,
which reduces the time that you need to keep the
camera absolutely still. If you’re using the Rebel
XSi/450D kit lens, you can also improve your odds
of shake-free shots by enabling the Image
Stabilizer (IS) feature (set the Stabilizer switch on
the lens to the On position). For a very slow shut-
ter speed, using a tripod is the best way to avoid
camera shake.
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of
field to a greater extent than the automated
exposure modes produce, visit Chapter 6. For an
explanation of the role of shutter speed and
aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5.

Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
Your options for using flash depend on which of the fully automatic exposure
modes you choose, as follows:
 Sports, Landscape, and Flash Off modes: Flash is disabled for these
modes. For the Flash Off mode, that behavior makes sense, of course.
But why no flash in the other two modes? Well, Sports mode is designed
to enable you to capture moving subjects, and the flash can make that
more difficult because it needs time to recycle between shots. On top of
that, the maximum shutter speed that’s possible with the built-in flash is
1/200 second, which often isn’t fast enough to ensure a blur-free subject.
Finally, action photos usually aren’t taken at a range close enough for
the flash to reach the subject, which is also the reason why flash is dis-
abled for Landscape mode.
 Full Auto, Portrait, Close Up, and Night Portrait modes: In these
modes, the camera automatically pops up the built-in flash when
needed. You do have the option of setting the flash to either normal or
Red-Eye Reduction mode, however. You do so via the Red-Eye On/Off
setting on Shooting Menu 1. Select the option, as shown on the left in
Figure 2-5, and press the Set button to display the second screen in the
figure. Then highlight your choice and press Set again. When you turn
the feature off, the flash operates in normal mode.
In Red-Eye Reduction mode, the Red-Eye Reduction lamp on the front of
the camera lights up when you press the shutter button halfway. The
purpose of this light is to attempt to shrink the subject’s pupils, which
helps reduce the chances of red-eye. The flash itself fires when you press
the shutter button the rest of the way. See Chapters 5 and 7 for more tips
about using your flash.
Figure 2-5: Turn Red-Eye Reduction flash mode on and off via Shooting Menu 1.

Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
You can also verify the current flash
setting by displaying the Camera
Function Settings screen, shown in
Figure 2-6. To display this screen,
press the Menu button and then press
the DISP button. Additionally, the
viewfinder displays the following sym-
bols to alert you to the flash status:
 Flash On: A little lightning bolt
like the one you see in the margin
here and in the highlighted area
of Figure 2-7 tells you that the
flash is enabled. The viewfinder
symbol doesn’t indicate whether
the Red-Eye Reduction mode is
enabled, however.
 Flash Recycling: If you see
the word Busy along with
the lightning bolt, as
shown in Figure 2-7, the
flash needs a few moments
to recharge. When the
flash is ready to go, the
Busy message disappears.
 Red-Eye Signal: After you
press the shutter button
halfway in Red-Eye
Reduction flash mode,
a row of vertical bars
appears in the center of
the viewfinder display,
just to the left of the ISO
value readout. A few
instants later, the bars
turn off one by one. For
best results, wait until all
the bars are off to take the picture. (The delay gives the subject’s pupils
time to constrict in response to the Red-Eye Reduction lamp.)
Exploring Your Automatic Options
You can choose from seven fully automatic exposure modes, all of which you
access via the Mode dial on the top of the camera, shown in Figure 2-8.
Red-Eye Reduction flash status
Figure 2-6: The Camera Function Settings
screen indicates whether Red-Eye
Reduction flash is enabled.
Flash status indicators
Figure 2-7: A Busy signal means that the flash is
recharging.

The next sections provide details on
each of these options. For information
about the five other settings on the
Mode dial — P (programmed auto-
exposure), Tv (shutter-priority auto-
exposure), Av (aperture-priority
autoexposure), M (manual exposure),
and A-DEP (automatic depth-of-
field autoexposure), see Chapter 5.
Full Auto mode
In this mode, represented on the
Mode dial by the green rectangle you
see in the margin here, the camera
selects all settings based on the
scene that it detects in front of the
lens. Your only job is to lock in focus,
using the two-stage autofocus tech-
nique I outline at the beginning of the chapter, or by setting the lens to manual
focus mode and using the focus ring on the lens, as explained in Chapter 1.
Full Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these limita-
tions in mind:
 Picture Style: Full Auto mode records your photo using the Standard
Picture Style setting. The aim of this mode is to produce a crisp, vivid
image. You can get more details about how Picture Styles affect your
photos in Chapter 6.
 Drive mode: The camera selects the Single setting automatically, so you
record one image for every press of the shutter button. For information
on how to change the setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode,
see the last section in this chapter.
 Flash: The camera takes control over whether you can use flash. You
can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter doesn’t sense
that additional light is needed. Nor can you disable the flash or adjust its
intensity, a feature I cover in Chapter 5. You can, however, choose to use
Red-Eye Reduction flash mode; see the preceding section for details.
 Autofocus control: In most cases, the camera focuses on the object clos-
est to it. To focus on a different area, the easiest option is to switch to
manual focusing.
If you do stick with autofocus, note that the camera adjusts its autofo-
cusing behavior depending on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still
or moving subject. For still subjects, the camera locks focus when you
depress the shutter halfway. But if the camera senses motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus from the time you depress the shutter button halfway.
45
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Fully automatic exposure modes
Figure 2-8: You can select from seven fully
automatic exposure modes.

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
You must reframe your shot as necessary to keep the subject within one
of the nine autofocus points to ensure sharp focus.
See Chapter 6 for additional information on getting good autofocus results.
 Color: You can’t adjust color. If the image displays a color cast, you must
switch to a mode that enables you to adjust the white balance setting,
covered in Chapter 6.
 Exposure: You also give up total control over exposure to the camera.
Chapter 5 shows you what you’re missing.
 Quality: For the Quality setting, which determines both the image reso-
lution, or pixel count, and the file format, you are limited to settings that
use the JPEG file format. Chapter 3 discusses this issue.
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Full Auto mode
because, frankly, the results that this setting create vary widely depending on
how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait, land-
scape, action shot, or whatever. But the bottom line is that Full Auto is a one-
size-fits-all approach that may not take best advantage of your camera’s
capabilities. So if you want to more consistently take great pictures instead of
good ones, I encourage you to explore the exposure, focus, and color infor-
mation found in Part II so that you can abandon this exposure mode in favor
of ones that put more photographic decisions in your hands.
Automatic scene modes (a.k.a. Image Zone modes)
In Full Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you
want to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to
rely on the camera to make that judgment, your camera offers six other fully
automatic modes that are specifically designed for taking popular categories
of pictures. For example, most people prefer portraits that have softly
focused backgrounds. So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that
can produce that type of background. 
These six automatic modes — the ones represented by the little pictographs
on the Mode dial — are officially known as Image Zone modes in Canon lingo
and in your camera manual. For reasons I state in Chapter 1, I avoid using the
whole “zone” moniker system in this book and instead refer to the six Image
Zone modes as fully automatic scene modes. But if you should seek informa-
tion about these modes elsewhere, whether online or in your manual, be sure
to search for the topic under its official name. 
Whatever you call them, all six modes share a few limitations — or benefits,
depending on how you look at things: 
 Color: As with Full Auto mode, you can’t tweak color. Some modes
manipulate colors in ways that you may or may not appreciate, and
you’re stuck if you have a color cast problem.

 Exposure: The camera takes complete control of exposure, too.
 Quality: You can’t take advantage of the Raw file format (CR2, on your
Canon); you must use the JPEG format. See Chapter 3 to find out which
of the JPEG settings is most appropriate for the way you plan to use
your pictures.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the
scene modes. To see whether you approve of how your camera approaches
the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t happy with the
results, you can switch to one of the advanced exposure modes and then
check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to manipulate whatever aspect of
the picture isn’t to your liking.
Portrait mode
Portrait mode attempts to select an aperture (f-stop) setting that results in a
short depth of field, which blurs the background and puts the visual empha-
sis on your subject. Figure 2-9 offers an example. Keep in mind, though, that
the short depth of field produced by Portrait mode may result in softer focus
on objects set in front of your subject, not just those behind it. Either way,
the extent to which the depth of field is reduced depends on the current
lighting conditions (which affect the range of f-stops the camera can use), the
distance between your subject and those foreground or background objects,
and a couple of other factors that I discuss in Chapter 6.
Figure 2-9: Portrait setting produces a softly focused background.
47
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Along with favoring an f-stop that produces a shorter depth of field, the
camera selects these settings in Portrait mode:
 Picture Style: Logically enough, the camera automatically sets the Picture
Style option to Portrait. As detailed in Chapter 6, this Picture Style results
in a slightly less sharp image, the main idea being to keep skin texture nice
and soft. Colors are also adjusted subtly to enhance skin tones.
 Drive mode: Contrary to what you may expect, the Drive mode is set to
Continuous, which means that the camera records a series of images in
rapid succession as long as you hold down the shutter button. This
technique can come in especially handy if your portrait subject can’t be
counted on to remain still for very long — a toddler or pet, for example.
Should you want to include yourself in the portrait, you can switch the
Drive mode setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode. See the end
of this chapter for details.
 Flash: You have the option of using regular or Red-Eye Reduction mode —
but only if the camera decides that you need a flash to properly light the
scene.
For outdoor portraits, this can pose a problem: A flash generally
improves outdoor portraits, and if the ambient light is very bright, the
camera doesn’t give you access to the flash. For an illustration of the dif-
ference a flash can make, see Chapter 7. That chapter also contains tips
on using flash in nighttime and indoor portraits.
 Autofocusing: Portrait mode employs the One-Shot AF (autofocus)
mode. This is one of three AF modes available on your camera, all
detailed in Chapter 6. In One-Shot mode, the camera locks focus when
you press the shutter button halfway. Typically, the camera locks focus
on the object that’s closest to the camera. If your subject moves out
of the selected autofocus point, the camera doesn’t adjust focus to
compensate.
Keep in mind that you can use Portrait mode any time you want a slightly
blurry background, not just for people pictures. Try this mode when shooting
statues, still-life arrangements (such as a vase of flowers on a kitchen table),
and the like. And one more tip: If you’re not sure that your subject will remain
motionless, Sports mode, which is designed to capture moving subjects with-
out blur, may deliver better results. I often suggest this mode for shooting
children and pets, for example.
Landscape mode
Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas,
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, produces a large depth of field.

As a result, objects both close to
the camera and at a distance
appear sharply focused. Figure 2-10
offers an example. Notice that
everything from the foreground
saplings to the architectural
ruins to the background trees
appear about the same in terms of
sharpness.
Like Portrait mode, Landscape
mode achieves the greater depth of
field by manipulating the exposure
settings — specifically, the aper-
ture, or f-stop setting. So the extent
to which the camera can succeed
in keeping everything in sharp
focus depends on the available
light. To fully understand this
issue, see Chapter 6. And in the
meantime, know that you also can
extend depth of field by zooming
out, if your camera offers a zoom
lens, and moving farther from your
subject.
As for other camera settings,
Landscape mode results in the
following options:
 Picture Style: The camera automatically sets the Picture Style option to
Landscape, which produces a sharper image, with well-defined “edges” —
the borders between areas of contrast or color change. The Picture Style
setting also produces more vivid blues and greens, which is what most
people prefer from their landscape photos. You can read more about
Picture Styles in Chapter 6.
 Drive mode: The camera selects the Single option, which records one
image for each press of the shutter button. As with the other scene
modes, you can switch to a Self-Timer or Remote-Control setting by fol-
lowing the steps laid out at the end of this chapter.
 Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal:
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting
most landscapes anyway.
49
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Figure 2-10: Landscape mode produces a large
zone of sharp focus and also boosts color
intensity slightly.

50
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which means that focus
is locked when you depress the shutter button halfway. (See Chapter 6
for details.) Focus usually is set on the nearest object, but remember
that because of the large depth of field that the Landscape mode pro-
duces, both far and near objects may appear equally sharp, depending
on their distance from the lens.
Again, think beyond the Landscape moniker when you look for good ways to
put this mode to use: Try it when shooting long-range pictures of animals at
the zoo, for example, so that critters both near and far appear sharp.
Close-Up mode
Switching to Close-Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought.
But choosing Close-Up mode does
result in an aperture (f-stop) setting
that results in a short depth of field,
which blurs background objects so
that they don’t compete for atten-
tion with your main subject. I used
this setting to capture the crab
apple blossoms in Figure 2-11. As
with Portrait mode, though, how
much the background blurs varies
depending on the distance between
your subject and the background as
well as on the lighting conditions,
your camera-to-subject distance,
and the lens focal length. (Chapter 6
explains all these issues.)
Other settings selected for you in
Close-Up mode are as follows:
 Picture Style: Close-Up mode
uses the Standard picture
style, just like Full Auto. The
resulting image features crisp
edges and vivid colors.
 Drive mode: The Drive mode
is set to Single, so you record
one photo each time you fully depress the shutter button. You can, how-
ever, select a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode if needed.
Figure 2-11: Close-Up mode also produces short
depth of field.

 Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks additional light is
needed, and it’s disabled when the camera decides that the ambient
light is sufficient. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode, but
frankly, you shouldn’t be firing the flash at close range to either human
or animal subjects — you can hurt their eyes.
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot mode; again, that simply
means that when you depress the shutter button halfway, the camera
locks focus, usually on the nearest object.
See Chapter 6 for more details about AF modes and other focusing issues.
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Sports mode
Sports mode results in a number of
settings that can help you photo-
graph moving subjects, such as the
girl in the swing in Figure 2-12.
First, the camera selects a fast
shutter speed, which is needed to
“stop motion.” Shutter speed is an
exposure control that you can
explore in Chapter 5.
Also keep these Sports mode set-
tings in mind:
 Picture Style: The camera
automatically sets the Picture
Style option to Standard, the
same one used for Full Auto
and Close-Up mode. This pic-
ture style is designed to pro-
duce sharp images with bold
colors.
 Drive mode: To enable rapid-
fire image capture, the Drive
mode is set to Continuous.
This mode enables you to
record multiple frames with
a single press of the shutter
button. You also have the
option of switching to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode. Check out
the end of this chapter for details on Drive mode settings.
51
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Figure 2-12: To capture moving subjects without
blur, try Sports mode.

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Flash: Flash is disabled, which can be a problem in low-light situations,
but it also enables you to shoot successive images more quickly because
the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. In addition, dis-
abling the flash permits a faster shutter speed; when the flash is on, the
maximum shutter speed is 1/200 second. (See Chapter 5 for details
about flash and shutter speeds.)
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to AI Servo. In this mode, the camera
establishes focus initially when you depress the shutter button halfway.
But if the subject moves, the camera attempts to refocus.
For this feature to work correctly, you must adjust framing so that your
subject remains within one of the autofocus points. You may find it
easier to simply switch to manual focusing and twist the focusing ring
as needed to track the subject’s movement yourself. 
The other critical thing to understand about Sports mode is that whether the
camera can select a shutter speed fast enough to stop motion depends on the
available light and the speed of the subject itself. In Figure 2-12, the camera
selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, catch my subject in midswing;
although if you look very closely, you can see some slight blurring of the foot
near the bottom of the frame. 
To fully understand shutter speed, visit Chapter 5. And for more tips on
action photography, check out Chapter 7.
Night Portrait mode
As its name implies, Night Portrait mode is designed to deliver a better-looking
portrait at night (or in any dimly lit environment). It does so by combining
flash with a slow shutter speed. That slow shutter speed produces a longer
exposure time, which enables the camera to rely more on ambient light and
less on the flash to expose the picture. The result is a brighter background
and softer, more even lighting.
I cover the issue of using a slow shutter speed in detail in Chapter 5; Chapter 7
has some additional nighttime photography tips. For now, the critical thing
to know is that the slower shutter speed means that you probably need a
tripod; if you try to handhold the camera, you run the risk of moving the
camera during the long exposure, resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the
Image Stabilizer (IS) feature of your lens, if available, can help, but for night-
time shooting, even that may not permit successful handheld shooting. Your
subjects also must stay perfectly still during the exposure, which can also be
a challenge.

If you do try Night Portrait mode, be aware of these other settings that are
automatically selected by the camera:
 Picture Style: The Standard setting, designed to deliver sharp, bold
photos, is selected. See Chapter 6 for more about Picture Style options
and how they affect your images.
 Drive mode: The default setting is Single, but you also can choose a Self-
Timer or Remote Control mode. Check out the end of this chapter for
details on Drive mode settings.
 Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks more light is needed —
which, assuming that you’re actually shooting at night, should be most
of the time. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode if you
prefer. See the section “Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for details. 
 Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which locks focus when
you depress the shutter button halfway. Focus isn’t adjusted if your sub-
ject moves out of the selected autofocusing point before you record the
image.
Flash Off mode
The Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Full Auto mode but ensures
that the flash doesn’t fire, even in dim lighting. This mode provides an easy
way to ensure that you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that
don’t permit flash: museums, churches, and so on. But it can also come in
handy any time you prefer not to use flash. See Chapters 5 and 7 for informa-
tion about flash photography.
Changing the Drive Mode
Your camera offers the following Drive mode settings:
 Single: This setting, which is the default for all of the fully automatic
modes except Portrait and Sports, records a single image each time you
press the shutter button. In other words, this is normal-photography
mode.
 Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this setting records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button.
On the Rebel XSi/450D, you can capture as many as 31⁄2 shots per second.
Obviously, this mode is great for capturing fast-paced subjects, which is
why it’s the default setting for Sports mode. It’s also the selected option
for Portrait mode, which is a great benefit if your subject is the fidgety
type. (See Chapter 7 for more action-photography tips.)
53
Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Self-Timer/Remote Control: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select
this mode and then press the shutter button and run into the frame. You
have about 10 seconds to get yourself in place and pose before the
image is recorded.
I also often use the self-timer function when I want to avoid any possibil-
ity of camera shake. The mere motion of pressing the shutter button can
cause slight camera movement, which can blur an image. So I put the
camera on a tripod and then activate the self-timer function. This
enables “hands-free” — and therefore motion-free — picture-taking.
As another way to enable hands-free shooting, you can purchase the
optional, wireless remote-control unit sold by Canon. Choose the Self-
Timer/Remote Control mode to use that gadget to trigger the shutter
release button.
 2-Second Self-Timer: This mode works just like the regular self-timer
mode, but the capture happens just two seconds after you fully depress
the shutter button. Unfortunately, this mode isn’t available to you in the
fully automatic exposure modes; you can choose this option only in P,
Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP modes. I cover it here just so you’ll know the option
exists. (And by the way, this option, new to the Rebel family, makes
using the self-timer for hands-free shooting much more convenient —
you now don’t have to wait 10 seconds for each shot to fire off.)
 Self-Timer Continuous: With this option, the camera waits 10 seconds
after you depress the shutter button and then captures a continuous
series of images. You can record as many as 10 continuous images.
To select a Drive mode, press the left
cross key. You then see a screen simi-
lar to the one in Figure 2-13. However,
you see all five Drive mode options
only in the advanced exposure modes
(P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). In the fully
automatic modes, you see only the
default Drive mode option that the
camera uses for your selected expo-
sure mode, plus the Self-
Timer/Remote Control option and the
Self-Timer Continuous option.
Either way, press the right or left
cross key to highlight your Drive
mode of choice. For the Self-Timer
Continuous mode, press the up or down cross key to set the number of con-
tinuous shots you want the camera to capture, as shown in the figure. Finally,
press the Set button to lock in the setting.
Your selected Drive mode remains in force until you change it or switch to an
exposure mode for which the selected Drive mode isn’t available.

options only in advanced exposure modes.

A
lmost every review of the Rebel XSi/450D contains glowing reports
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve no doubt dis-
covered for yourself, those claims are true, too: This baby can create large,
beautiful images.
Getting the maximum output from your camera, however,
depends on choosing the right capture settings. Chief
among them, and the topic of this chapter, is the appro-
priately named Quality setting. Found on Shooting
Menu 1, this critical control determines two impor-
tant aspects of your pictures: resolution, or pixel
count; and file format, which refers to the type of
computer file the camera uses to store your picture
data.
Resolution and file format work together to deter-
mine the quality of your photos, so selecting from the
eight Quality settings on your camera is an important
decision. Why not just dial in the setting that produces
the maximum quality level and be done with it, you ask?
Well, that’s the right choice for some photographers. But
because choosing that maximum setting has some disadvantages, you
may find that stepping down a notch or two on the quality scale is a better
option every now and then.

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To help you figure out which Quality setting meets your needs, this chapter
explains exactly how resolution and file format affect your pictures. Just in
case you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first
section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition,
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image,
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show
five common digital-image defects.
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt

Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only two are affected
by the Quality setting on Shooting Menu 1. So if you aren’t happy with your
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies:
 Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which
you do via the Quality control. See the upcoming section, “Considering
Resolution: Large, Medium, or Small?” for details.
 JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as
JPEG artifacts. This defect is also related to the Quality setting; see
“Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)” to find out more.
 Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise is most often related to a very
long exposure time (that is, a very slow shutter speed) or to an exposure
control called ISO, which you can explore in Chapter 5. To adjust shutter
speed or ISO, you must switch to one of the advanced exposure modes
(P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
 Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s white bal-
ance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. Note,
though, that you also must use an advanced exposure mode to adjust
white balance.
 Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,” else-
where in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor cleaning. 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in your
photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. Some defects, espe-
cially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appearance until you see
them at a magnified view.
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your Canon is
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Decoding the Quality Options
Your camera’s Quality control determines both the image resolution and file
format of the pictures you shoot. To access the control, press the Menu
button and then display Shooting Menu 1, shown on the left in Figure 3-2.
Highlight Quality and press the Set button to display the screen you see on
the right in the figure.
Figure 3-2: You set resolution and file format together via the Quality menu.
In Figure 3-2, the right screen displays all the Quality settings available on the
Rebel XSi/450D. But see that little replica of the Mode dial, labeled Exposure
mode indicator in the figure? When the symbol representing an exposure
mode is dimmed, you can’t use that mode if you want to access all the set-
tings on the screen. In this case, for example, the graphic tells you that the
eight Quality options shown in Figure 3-2 are available only in the P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP modes. If you instead set the camera to Full Auto or one of the

Either way, if you’re new to digital
photography, the Quality settings
won’t make much sense to you until
you read the rest of this chapter,
which explains format and resolution
in detail. But even if you are schooled
in those topics, you may need some
help deciphering the way that the set-
tings are represented on your camera.
As you can see from Figures 3-2 and
3-3, the options are presented in
rather cryptic fashion, so here’s your
decoder ring:
 The first column of settings pro-
duce files in the JPEG file format.
 The little arc-like icons represent the level of JPEG compression, which
affects picture quality and file size. You get two JPEG options, which 
carry the labels Fine and Normal. The Fine setting is represented by the
smooth arcs; the Normal setting is represented by the stairstepped arcs.
Check out the section “JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard” for
details on this issue.
 Within the JPEG category, you can choose from three resolution settings,
represented by L, M, and S (large, medium, and small). See the next sec-
tion for information that will help you select the right resolution.
 The Quality settings in the second column enable you to capture images
in the Raw file format. Again, these two options appear only if you set
the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av,
M, or A-DEP). All Raw files are created at the Large resolution setting,
giving you the maximum pixel count. One of the two Raw settings also
records a JPEG Fine version of the image, also at the maximum resolu-
tion. The section “Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice” explains the benefits
and downsides to using the Raw format.
To select a Quality option, just highlight it and press the Set button. The
selected setting then appears next to the Quality item in Shooting Menu 1 and
at the bottom of the Camera Settings display, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Note that changing the Quality setting also changes the number of pictures
that you can store on your memory card. That number appears in the lower-
right corner of the display, as labeled in Figure 3-4. See the upcoming sidebar
“How many pictures fit on my memory card?” for details on this issue.

Figure 3-4: The Quality setting affects the number of pictures remaining.
So, which Quality option is best? The answer depends on several factors,
including how you plan to use your pictures and how much time you care to
spend in the digital darkroom, processing your images on your computer.
The rest of this chapter explains these and other issues related to the Quality
settings. 
Considering Resolution: Large, 
Medium, or Small?
To decide upon a Quality setting, the first decision you need to make is how
many pixels you want your image to contain. Pixels are the little square tiles
from which all digital images are made; the word pixel is short for picture ele-
ment. You can see some pixels close up in the right image in Figure 3-5, which
shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area of the left image.
The number of pixels in an image is referred to as resolution. Your camera
offers you three resolution levels, which are assigned the generic labels
Large, Medium, and Small and are represented on the list of Quality settings
by the initials L, M, and S. Table 3-1 shows you the pixel count that results
from each option. (If you select Raw as your Quality setting, images are
always captured at the Large resolution value.)

In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values.
This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP for short. One
megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off the megapixel values in the
table.)
To figure out how many pixels are enough, you need to understand how reso-
lution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sections
explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Pixels and print quality
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels,
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the
right example in Figure 3-5.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-by-10-inch
print at 200 ppi, for example, you need a pixel count of 1600 x 2000.
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)

Even though many photo editing programs enable you to add pixels to an
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with,
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does on printed photos. What resolution
does do is determine the size at which the image appears.

This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography,
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need way
fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For exam-
ple, Figure 3-6 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
For e-mail images, I usually stick with a maximum horizontal pixel count of
450 and a maximum vertical size of 400 pixels, depending on whether the pic-
ture is oriented horizontally, as in the figure, or vertically. If your image is
much larger, the recipient can’t view the entire picture without scrolling the
display.
In short, even if you use one of the Small Quality settings on your Rebel XSi/
450D, which produces images that contain 2256 x 1504 pixels, you’ll have
more than enough pixels for most onscreen uses. The only exception might
be an image that you want to display via a digital projector that has a very
high screen resolution. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue and also shows you
how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Figure 3-6: A 450-x-300-pixel image is plenty large for sharing via e-mail.

Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
Large files present several problems:
 You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on the
memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can
hamper fast-action shooting.
 When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and
download.
 When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But
note that file format, which is the other half of the Quality equation on your
Canon, also affects file size. See the section “Understanding File Type (JPEG
or Raw)” for more on that topic. The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures
fit on my memory card?” provides details on the file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the follow-
ing recommendations about whether to choose Large, Medium, or Small
when you select a Quality setting: 
 Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create a
low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online.
Chapter 9 shows you how.
Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print.
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the
print quality of a low-resolution image.

 For everyday snapshots, the Medium setting (6.3 MP) is probably suffi-
cient. I find 12.2 MP, which is what you get from the Large setting, to be
overkill for most casual snapshots, which means that you’re creating
huge files for no good reason. So I stick with Medium unless I’m shooting
critical images.
 Jump up to Large (12.2 MP) if you plan to crop your photos or make
huge prints. Always use the maximum resolution if you think you 
may want to crop your photo and enlarge the remaining image. For
example, when I shot the left photo in Figure 3-7, I wanted to fill the
frame with the butterfly, but I couldn’t do so without getting so close
that I risked scaring it away. So I kept my distance and took the picture
at the Large setting, which enabled me to crop the photo and still 
have enough pixels left to produce a great print, as you see in the 
right image.
 Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Lower resolution
produces smaller files, and the smaller the file, the less time the camera
needs to record the image to your memory card. Also see Chapter 7 for
other tips on action photography.

How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new
camera owners — and it’s an important one
because you don’t want to run out of space on
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the discussions in this chapter,
image resolution (pixel count) and file format
(JPEG or Raw) together determine the size of the
picture file which, in turn, determines how many
photos fit in a given amount of camera memory.
The table below shows you the approximate size
of the files, in megabytes (MB) that are generated
at each of the possible resolution/format combi-
nations on your Rebel XSi/450D. (The actual file
size of any image also depends on other factors,
such as the subject, ISO setting, and Picture Style
setting.) In the Image Capacity column, you see
approximately how many pictures you can store
at the setting on a 1GB (gigabyte) memory card. If
you have a 2GB card, double the picture counts;
for a 526MB (megabyte) card, expect to fit half
the number of pictures.

Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)
In addition to establishing the resolution of your photos, the Quality
setting determines the file format. The file format simply refers to the
type of image file that the camera produces.

Your Canon offers two file formats, JPEG and Raw, with a couple variations of
each. The next sections explain the pros and cons of each setting.
Don’t confuse file format with the Format option on Setup Menu 1. That
option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your camera, as it is
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 Web compatibility: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot
them.
 Small files: JPEG files are smaller than those produced by the other
common format offered by today’s digital cameras, known as Camera
Raw, or just Raw. And smaller files means that your pictures consume
less room on your camera memory card and in your computer’s storage
tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1, near the start of this chapter.
On your camera, the amount of compression that is applied depends on
whether you choose a Quality setting that carries the label Fine or Normal.
The difference between the two breaks down as follows:
 Fine: At this setting, represented by the symbol you see in the margin
here, very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many com-
pression artifacts, if any.
 Normal: Switch to Norm (for Normal), and the compression amount
rises, as does the chance of seeing some artifacting. Notice the jaggedy-
ness of the Normal icon, shown in the margin here? That’s your
reminder that all may not be “smooth” sailing when you choose a
Normal setting.
For comparison, Figures 3-8 and 3-9 show you the same subject shot at the
Large/Fine and Large/Normal settings, along with the respective file sizes that
each option produces. (I captured each image at the same resolution so that
file type is the only variable.)
67
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 3-8: The Fine setting produces very good image quality and reasonable file sizes.
Figure 3-9: Enlarging an image captured at the Normal setting reveals some quality loss.
When you view the left examples in the comparison figures, you may not see
much difference between the images, although the type on the lighter cases
looks a little sharper in the Large/Fine example. For most printed photos, in
fact, compression defects aren’t terribly distinct when the print size is small.
But when you enlarge your photos, as I did for the right examples in the fig-
ures, the exact nature of the quality loss that occurs with JPEG compression
becomes clearer.
Large/Normal, 2.2MB
Large/Fine, 4.3MB

Know, too, that compression artifacts usually are significantly easier to spot
when you view digital images on a computer monitor. (The print process
itself softens some of the compression defects.) Artifacting is also usually
more visible in areas of flat color than it is in detailed or textured areas.
For my money, the file size benefit you gain when going from Fine to Normal
isn’t worth the risk of artifacts, especially with the price of camera memory
cards getting lower every day. And of all the defects that you can correct in a
photo editor, artifacting is perhaps the hardest to accomplish. So if I shoot in
the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level
of artifacting you can accept. Again, artifacting is often much easier to spot
when you view images onscreen than I can reproduce here in print.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change
the file type to Raw, explained next.
Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice
The other picture-file type that you can create on your Canon is called
Camera Raw, or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw files; Canon’s are called CR2 files
(or, on some older models, CRW). If you use a Windows computer, you see
that three-letter designation at the end of your picture filenames.
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for two 
reasons:
 Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as
needed to produce the results that Canon believes its customers prefer.
With Raw, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and
uses special software known as a raw converter to produce the actual
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point.
The upshot is that “shooting Raw” enables you, not the camera, to have
the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting
that can occur with JPEG.
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages.
To wit:
69
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

70
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 You can’t do anything with your pictures until you process them with
a Raw converter. You can’t share them online or put them in a docu-
ment for example. Nor can you have them printed at your local drug-
store’s photo kiosk or your favorite online printer; if you want a hard
copy of a Raw image, you must print it yourself, using the Canon soft-
ware provided with your camera. Long story short, when you shoot Raw,
you add to the time you must spend in front of the computer instead of
behind the camera lens. Chapter 8 shows you how to process your Raw
files using your Canon software.
Note, too, that technology that may enable retail printers to print Raw
files is on the horizon, so you may not have to process the images to get
prints made in the near future. Of course, that means that the printer
would do the processing, making all those color, exposure, and other
judgments for you, but only for the prints you order. You could still
process the images for your own use on your computer. 
 Raw files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that Raw
applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is larger files. In
addition, Raw files are always captured at the maximum resolution avail-
able on your camera, even if you don’t really need all those pixels. For
both reasons, Raw files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so they take
up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s hard drive
or other picture-storage device.
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you
make up your mind, compare the Large/Fine JPEG image in Figure 3-8 with its
Raw counterpart, shown in Figure 3-10. You may be able to detect some
subtle quality differences in the enlarged view, but most people would be
hard pressed to distinguish between the two otherwise. And JPEG certainly
wins out in terms of convenience, time savings, and smaller file size. (Note
that during the Raw conversion process, I tried to use settings that kept the
Raw image as close as possible to its JPEG cousin in all aspects but quality.
But any variations in exposure, color, and contrast are a result of the conver-
sion process, not of the format per se.)
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your
photo editor later.
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But
keep in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I
don’t really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw
images. Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered
by imperfections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if
you will.)

Figure 3-10: The difference between Raw and Large/Fine images typically is noticeable only when images
are greatly enlarged.
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from the following two
Quality options:
 RAW: This setting produces a single Raw file at the maximum resolution
(12.2 megapixels).
 RAW+Large/Fine: This setting produces two files: the standard Raw file
plus a JPEG file captured at the Large/Fine setting. At first glance, this
option sounds great: You can share the JPEG online or get prints made
and then process your Raw files when you have time.
The problem is that, like the Raw file, the JPEG image is captured at the
maximum pixel count — which is too large for onscreen viewing. That
means that you have to edit the JPEG file anyway to trim down the pixel
count before online sharing, although you can produce great prints right
away. In addition, creating two files for every image eats up substantially
more memory card space. I leave it up to you to decide whether the
pluses are worth the minuses.
My take: Choose Fine or Raw
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you.
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of
JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and
interest to do the Raw conversion process, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 for
more information on the conversion process.
Raw, 15.3MB
71
Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality

72
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with
one of the Fine settings (Large/Fine, Medium/Fine, or Small/Fine). 
 Stay away from JPEG Normal. The tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my
opinion, worth the risk of compression artifacts. As with my recommen-
dations on resolution, this fits the “better safe than sorry” formula: You
never know when you may capture a spectacular, enlargement-worthy
subject, and it would be a shame to have the photo spoiled by compres-
sion defects.
 Finally, remember that the format and resolution together determine the
ultimate picture quality. So be sure that you select the Quality setting
that offers both the appropriate number of pixels and format for how
you plan to use your image. If you capture an image at the Small/Normal
setting, for example, and then print the photo at a large size, the combi-
nation of a lower pixel count and a higher level of JPEG compression
may produce a disappointing picture quality.
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo defects —
compression artifacts, pixelation, and the like —
is the impact of plain-old dust and dirt on picture
quality. But no matter what camera settings you
use, you aren’t going to achieve great picture
quality with a dirty lens. So make it a practice to
clean your lens on a regular basis, using one of
the specialized cloths and cleaning solutions
made expressly for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will. By
default, your camera performs an internal
sensor cleaning every time you turn it on and
off; you can also run the cleaning process at
any time you want by opening Setup Menu 2,
choosing the Sensor Cleaning option, and then
selecting Clean Now.
Especially if you frequently change lenses in a
dirty environment, however, this internal clean-
ing mechanism may not be able to fully remove
all specks from the sensor. In that case, you
need a more thorough cleaning, which is done
by actually opening up the camera and using
special sensor-cleaning tools. You can do this
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image
sensors are pretty delicate beings, and you can
easily damage it or other parts of your camera if
you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local camera
store that offers this service. In my area (central
Indiana), sensor cleaning costs about $30 to $50.
If you bought your camera at a traditional
camera store, the store may even provide free
sensor cleaning as a way to keep your business.
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean
never — try to clean any part of your camera
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can not
only damage the interior of your camera, blowing
dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be removed,
but it can also crack the external monitor.

ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photography is
being able to view my pictures on the camera monitor the
instant after I shoot them. No more guessing whether I cap-
tured the image I wanted or need to try again; no more
wasting money on developing and printing pictures that
stink. In fact, this feature alone was reason enough for
me to turn my back forever on my closetful of film
photography hardware and all the unexposed film
remaining from my predigital days.
Of course, with the Rebel XSi/450D, you can use the
monitor not only to review your photos, but also to
preview them. That is, if you turn on Live View shoot-
ing, you can use the monitor instead of the viewfinder
to compose and focus your shots.
Because both functions of your camera monitor involve some
of the same buttons, bells, and whistles, I cover them together in
this chapter. In addition, this chapter explains how to delete pictures that
you don’t like and protect the ones you love from accidental erasure.

For details about still more monitor-related topics, such as accessing camera
menus and viewing current shooting settings, check out Chapter 1 if you
haven’t already done so. Also visit Chapter 9, which covers some additional
ways to view your images, including how to create in-camera slide shows and
display your photos on a television screen.
Disabling and Adjusting Instant Review
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. By default, the instant-review period lasts just two seconds. But you can
customize this behavior via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1, as
shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: You can extend or disable automatic picture review.
Your choices are as follows:
 Select one of three specific review periods: 2, 4, or 8 seconds.
 Select Off to disable the automatic instant review altogether. You can
still view your pictures by pressing the Playback button. See the next
section for details.
Turning off the monitor can save battery power, so keep this option in
mind if the battery is running low. 
 Select Hold to display the current image indefinitely — or at least until
the camera automatically shuts itself off to save power or you put your
eye up to the viewfinder, which automatically turns off the monitor. (See
the Chapter 1 section about Setup Menu 1 to find out about the auto-
shutdown and auto-display-off features.)

Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To switch your camera to Playback mode and view the images currently on
your memory card, take these steps:
1. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-2 and shown in the
margin here.
The monitor displays the last picture you took along with some shooting
data.
To find out how to interpret the picture data and specify what data you
want to see, see the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” If you’re
curious about your options now, though, press the DISP button to cycle
through the available data-display formats. (Figure 4-2 shows the image
in the  mode that displays the least amount of shooting data.)
Figure 4-2: Press the Playback button to inspect your photos.
2. Press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
• Press the right cross key to view images starting with the oldest
one on the card.
• Press the left cross key to view images in reverse order, starting
with the most current picture.
Just keep pressing either key to browse through all of your images.

3. To return to picture-taking mode, press the Playback button or press
the shutter button halfway.
The camera exits Playback mode, and the Camera Settings display
appears on the monitor. Chapter 1 introduces you to that display.
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can also display multiple images at a time
and jump through images 10 or 100 at a time; the next two sections tell all.
Jumping through images
If your memory card contains scads of images, here’s a trick you’ll love: By
using the Jump feature, you can rotate the Main dial to leapfrog through pic-
tures instead of pressing the right or left cross key a bazillion times to get to
the picture you want to see. You also can search for the last image shot on a
specific date.
This feature works like so:
1. Press the Playback button
to put the camera into
Playback mode.
2. Press the up cross key.
The jump bar appears at
the bottom of the monitor,
as shown in Figure 4-3.
3. Select a Jump mode by
pressing the up or down
cross key.
The current Jump mode
appears on the jump bar.
You have four Jump mode
options:
• Jump 10 Images:
Select this option to advance 10 images at a time.
• Jump 100 Images: Select this option to advance 100 images at a
time.
• Jump Shot Date: If your card contains images shown on different
dates, you can jump between dates with this option. For example,
if you’re looking at the first of 30 pictures taken on June 1, you can
Figure 4-3: The current Jump mode appears on the
jump bar.

jump past all the others from that day to the first image taken on,
say, June 5.
• Jump 1 Image: This option, in effect, disables jumping, restricting
you to browsing pictures one at a time. More about the point of
this option later.
4. Rotate the Main dial to browse images using the selected Jump mode.
How many images you advance with each turn of the dial depends upon
the Jump mode you selected.
5. To exit Jump mode, press the right or left cross key.
Now you’re back to regular playback mode, in which each press of the
right or left cross key advances through your pictures one at a time. You
can return to your selected Jump mode by simply rotating the Main dial
at any time.
So what’s the point of the Jump 1 Image option, if you can return to one-
by-one playback just by pressing the right or left cross key? It’s simply
provided in case you prefer to use the Main dial to browse your images
instead of the cross keys. When you select the option, the Jump bar 
disappears, and then you can use either the Main Dial or the cross keys
to navigate your pictures.
You can jump through images only in regular, full-screen Playback mode. The
Main dial performs a different function in Index Display mode, in which you
can view four or nine image thumbnails at a time. The next section explains
this viewing mode.
Viewing multiple images at a time
If you want to quickly review and compare several photos, you can set the
camera to index display and view thumbnails of either four or nine images 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-4. Just press the AE Lock button, found on 
the upper-right corner of the camera back and shown in the margin here.
Press once to display four thumbnails at a time; press again to display nine
thumbnails.
Note the little blue checkerboard and magnifying glass icons under the
button — they’re reminders of the function the button serves in Playback
mode. The checkerboard indicates the index function, and the minus sign in
the magnifying glass tells you that pressing the button reduces the size of the
image display. (Remember, the black or silver labels near these buttons indi-
cate a function related to picture-taking.)

Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting

78
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-4: You can view four or nine thumbnails at once.
Remember these factoids about navigating and viewing your photo collection
in Index Display mode: 
 A highlight box surrounds the currently selected image. For example,
in Figure 4-4, the lower-right photo is selected.
 Use the cross keys to select a different image. Press the up cross key to
shift the selection box up, the right cross key to move it right, and so on.
 Rotate the Main dial to scroll through screens of thumbnails. Rotate
right to shift to the next screen; rotate left to go back one screen.
 Press the AF Point Selection button to reduce the number of thumb-
nails. This button lives right next door to the AE Lock button. It, too, has
a blue magnifying glass icon, this time with a plus sign in the center to
indicate that pressing the button enlarges the view. Press once to go
from nine thumbnails to four; press again to go from four thumbnails to
viewing the selected image at full-screen view. To return to Index Display
mode, press the AE Lock button again.
Rotating vertical pictures
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — that
is, whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo.
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file. Then when you view the
picture, either during the instant-review period or after you set the camera to
Playback mode, the camera reads the data and automatically rotates the
image so that it appears in the upright position in the monitor, as shown on
the left in Figure 4-5. The image is also rotated automatically when you view it
in the photo software that shipped with your camera.
Selected image

Figure 4-5: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or
sideways (right).
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented
pictures.
By default, automatic picture rotation is enabled for you. If for some reason
you want to turn it off, you can do so through the Auto Rotate option on
Setup Menu 1, as shown in Figure 4-6. You also can specify that you want the
picture to be rotated just on your computer monitor by choosing the second
of the two On settings (the one that doesn’t sport the little camera icon).
Figure 4-6: Go to Setup Menu 1 to disable or adjust automatic image rotation.
If you do turn off automatic rotation, you can rotate one or more images on
your memory card by taking these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Rotate, as shown in 
Figure 4-7.
79
Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-7: You also can rotate individual images from the Playback menu.
2. Press the Set button.
An image appears on the monitor, as shown on the right in Figure 4-7.
3. Navigate to the photo that you want to rotate.
Just press the right and left cross keys to do so.
4. Press Set to rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise.
Each time you press Set, you rotate the image another 90 degrees.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to rotate additional photos.
6. Press Menu to exit Rotate mode and return to the Playback menu.
You can also rotate images in Index Display mode; just use the cross keys to
select the photo that you want to rotate and then press the Set key.
Remember, the highlight box indicates the selected photo.
Zooming in for a closer view
By pressing the AF Point Selection button, posing here in the margin, you can
more closely inspect a portion of the onscreen image. This feature comes in
especially handy for checking small details, such as whether anyone’s eyes
are closed in a group portrait, for example, and for determining whether the
subject of your picture is sharply focused.
Here’s the scoop on this feature:
 Zoom in. You can enlarge an image display to a maximum of 10 times its
original size. Just keep pressing the AF Point Selection button until you
reach the magnification you want.

 View another part of the picture. Whenever the image is magnified, a
little thumbnail representing the entire image appears briefly in the
lower-right corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-8. The white box
indicates the portion of the image that’s currently consuming the rest of
the monitor space.
Use the cross keys to scroll the display to view a different portion of the
image. Press the up cross key to scroll up, the left cross key to scroll left,
and so on.
 View more images at the same magnification. Here’s an especially neat
trick: While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Main dial to dis-
play the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So, for
example, if you shot that group portrait several times, you can easily
check each one for shut-eye problems.
 View magnified images in Index Display mode. You can get close-up
views of the currently selected thumbnail (the one surrounded by the
highlight box) by pressing the AF Point Selection button. Just press the
button once or twice to get to full-frame view (depending on whether
you’re in 4-thumbnail or 9-thumbnail view). Then press again to shift to
magnify the selected image.
 Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the AE Lock
button. Continue holding the button down until you reach the magnifica-
tion you want.
Figure 4-8: Press the cross keys to scroll the display of the 
magnified image.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the AE Lock button
until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the Playback
button, which quickly returns you to the standard view.
Viewing Picture Data
In Playback mode, you can choose from four information-display styles,
which determine whether any shooting data appears along with the image in
the monitor.
The following list outlines the four display modes. To cycle through the vari-
ous modes, just press the DISP button. In single-image Playback mode, you
can access all four display styles. When you switch to Index mode (viewing
four or nine thumbnails at a time) or magnify an image, you can choose from
just the first two display modes.
Each display mode provides a different assortment of shooting information
along with your image. The next several sections offer a guide to the data you
can see in each mode, starting with the most basic and working up to the
most complex.
Basic information modes
In the simplest display mode, officially called Single Image display in the
camera manual, your photo appears on the monitor as shown in Figure 4-9.
Along the top of the screen, you see the following bits of information, labeled
in the figure:
 Shutter speed and aperture (f-stop): Chapter 5 explains these two expo-
sure settings.
 Exposure Compensation value: This option, also detailed in Chapter 5,
enables you to produce a brighter or darker image than the camera’s
autoexposure meter thinks appropriate. If you applied exposure com-
pensation, the amount appears to the right of the f-stop. A negative
value in the readout indicates that you requested a darker image; a posi-
tive value says that you ordered a brighter image. If you applied no
exposure compensation, this area of the display is empty.
 Protect: Using a feature described later in this chapter, you can “lock” an
image to prevent it from being accidentally deleted. If you do so, a little
key icon appears next to the Exposure Compensation value. Otherwise,
this part of the display is empty.
 Folder number and last four digits of file number: See Chapter 1 for
information about how the camera assigns folder and file numbers.

Figure 4-9: The most basic Playback mode displays your image with 
minimal shooting information.
From Single Image mode, press the DISP button again to shift to a mode
called Single Image Plus Quality. Now you get two additional pieces of infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 4-10: 
 Quality setting: This setting, covered in Chapter 3, determines the image
resolution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG or Raw).
The Quality symbols are the same ones used to indicate the Quality set-
ting on the camera menus and Camera Settings screen. Chapter 3 has a
chart to help you decode them.
 Image number/total images: This pair of values shows you the current
image number and the total number of images on the memory card. For
example, in Figure 4-10, you’re seeing picture 38 out of 61. (Don’t confuse
the image number with the actual file number; again, the last four digits
of the file number appear in the top-right corner of the display, along
with the folder number.)
To view more complete details about the camera settings you used to take a
picture, switch to Shooting Information display mode or Histogram display
mode. The next sections explain how to interpret all the data that appears in
these two modes.

Figure 4-10: Press DISP to add Quality setting information to the basic display.
Shooting Information display
In the Shooting Information display mode, the camera presents a thumbnail
of your image along with scads of shooting data, as shown in Figure 4-11.
(Remember: Just press the DISP button to cycle through display modes.)
Figure 4-11: You can view more data in Shooting Information playback mode.
Image number/total images
Quality setting

The chart-like thingy on the right side of the screen is an exposure-evaluation
tool known as a histogram. You can get schooled in reading histograms in the
next section.
If any areas of the image thumbnail are blinking, though, you don’t even need
to go that far to know that you may have an exposure problem. Those blink-
ing spots indicate areas that are completely white — known in the photogra-
phy business as blown highlights. Depending on where in the image those
areas occur, you may or may not have an exposure problem. For example, if
someone’s face contains the blinking spots, that someone is overexposed,
and you should take steps to correct the problem. But if the blinking occurs
in, say, a bright window behind the subject, and the subject itself looks fine,
you may choose to just ignore the alert.
To sort out the maze of other data, it helps to break the display down into
five rows of information — the row along the top of the screen and the four
rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histogram, as follows:
 Row 1 data: Here you see the same data that appears in the two basic
display modes, explained in the preceding section. Again, the Exposure
Compensation value and Protect icon don’t appear if you didn’t use
those features when you took the picture.
 Row 2 data: Jump now to the row of symbols just underneath the
thumbnail and histogram. Labeled in Figure 4-12, these symbols indicate
the following:
• Exposure mode: This symbol indicates which of the camera’s expo-
sure modes you used — Full Auto, P (programmed autoexposure),
Portrait, and so on. The symbols mirror what you see on the
camera Mode dial. You can find details about all the modes in
Chapters 2 and 5.
• Exposure Metering mode: This symbol represents the metering
mode, which determines which part of the frame the camera used
when calculating exposure. Chapter 5 explains.
Figure 4-12: This row contains additional exposure information.

• Flash Compensation amount: Here you can see whether you
adjusted flash power using the Flash Compensation feature,
detailed in Chapter 5.
• ISO speed: Chapter 5 also explains this option, which controls the
light sensitivity of the camera’s image sensor.
 Row 3 data: Information on this row of the display, labeled in Figure 4-13,
is mostly related to color settings. Here’s the scoop:
• White balance setting: Chapter 6 has details on this option, which
helps eliminate any unwanted color casts from your photos. AWB
stands for Auto White Balance; see the table in Chapter 6 for a look
at what the other symbols you may see here represent.
Figure 4-13: Look to this row for details about advanced color settings.
• White balance correction: Adjacent to the White Balance icon, this
collection of data tells you whether you applied any adjustment to
the white balance setting you used. Chapter 6 explains this
advanced color option.
• Picture Style: Notice that this symbol looks just like the one on the
bottom cross key on the camera back? In both cases, the symbol
represents Picture Styles, which enable you to tweak image color,
contrast, and sharpness. The S you see in Figure 4-13 represents
the Standard Picture Style, which is the default applied in most
exposure modes. The values to the right of the symbol relate to the
four characteristics that you can adjust for each Picture Style.
Chapter 6 explains how each Picture Style affects your image.
 Row 4 data: Labeled in Figure 4-14, this row tells you the following tid-
bits of information:
• Quality and file size: For details on the Quality setting and how it
affects file size and picture quality, see Chapter 3.
White balance
White balance correction 
Picture Style

Figure 4-14: The bottom two rows of the display offer this data.
• Original Decision Data: The Rebel XSi/450D enables you to tag an
image file with a code that indicates that the image is original —
meaning that it hasn’t been altered in a photo program or other-
wise tampered with after it was captured. In order to check the
code, you need a separate product called the Original Data
Verification Kit, which retails for about $650, unfortunately. If you
do enable the feature on the camera, which I explain how to do in
Chapter 11, a lock icon appears in this area of the playback screen.
Otherwise, this area is empty.
• Color space: Your camera can capture images in two color spaces,
sRGB and Adobe RGB. A color space is a definition of the spectrum
of colors that an image can contain. You can change color spaces
only in advanced exposure modes; Chapter 6 has details about
how and why to do so.
 Row 5 data: Wrapping up the smorgasbord of shooting data, the bottom
row of the playback screen holds two more pieces of information:
• Image number/total images recorded: Again, this pair of numbers
indicates the current image number with respect to the total
number of images on the current memory card. For example, the
values in Figure 4-14 show that you’re looking at the 38th of 61
images.
• Date and time: These values show you the exact moment that the
image was recorded. Of course, you must first set the camera date
and time, as Chapter 1 explains.
One note about Figures 4-11 through 4-14: I included all possible symbols,
values, and other shooting data just for the purposes of illustration. If any of
the data items don’t appear on your monitor, it simply means that the feature
wasn’t enabled when you captured the photo.

Understanding Histogram display mode
When you switch from Shooting Information display mode to the Histogram
display mode, you see the data shown in Figure 4-15. Again, you get the
thumbnail view of your image, but this time some of the extensive shooting
data is replaced by a second histogram.
Figure 4-15: Histogram display mode replaces some shooting data 
with an RGB histogram.
The next two sections explain what information you can glean from the his-
tograms. See the preceding sections for a map to the other shooting data on
the screen. 
Interpreting a brightness histogram
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include a
variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
RGB histogram
Brightness histogram

In Shooting Information display mode, areas that fall into this category blink
in the image thumbnail. This warning is a great feature because simply view-
ing the image on the camera monitor isn’t always a reliable way to gauge
exposure; the relative brightness of the monitor and the ambient light in
which you view it affect the appearance of the image onscreen. Again,
though, blinking highlights doesn’t necessarily indicate that your exposure is
off. If you have a dark subject against a very bright background, for example,
you may not be able to properly expose the subject without creating at least
some blown highlights in the background. 
For a detailed analysis of the image exposure, check the Brightness histogram,
which is a little graph that indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights,
and midtones in your image, as shown in Figure 4-16. Photographers use the
term tonal range to describe this aspect of their pictures. The Brightness his-
togram appears to the right of the image thumbnail in Shooting Info display
mode and in the lower right corner in Histogram display mode. 
The horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible picture brightness
values, from the darkest shadows on the left to the brightest highlights on
the right. And the vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular
brightness value. A spike indicates a heavy concentration of pixels.
For example, in Figure 4-16, which
shows the histogram for the peony
image shown in Figure 4-15, the 
histogram shows a heavy concentra-
tion of pixels in the dark-to-midtone
brightness values, with few highlight
pixels or black areas.
Keep in mind that there is no one
“perfect” histogram that you should
try to achieve. Instead, you need to
interpret the histogram with respect
to the amount of shadows, high-
lights, and midtones that comprise
your subject. For example, the his-
togram in Figure 4-15 might lead you
to worry that your image is lacking
in contrast because most of the
pixels are clustered in one area, and
there aren’t a lot of strong shadows or very bright highlights. But the his-
togram actually makes sense for this particular image; the subject itself con-
tains few very light or dark areas. You should pay attention, however, if you

Highlights
Figure 4-16: The Brightness histogram indicates
the tonal range of your image.

90
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
see a very high concentration of pixels at the far right or left end of the his-
togram, which can indicate a seriously overexposed or underexposed image
respectively.
Reading an RGB histogram
When you view your images in
Histogram display mode, you see
two histograms: the Brightness his-
togram, covered in the preceding
section, and an RGB histogram,
shown in Figure 4-17.
To make sense of the RGB his-
togram, you first need to know that
digital images are called RGB
images because they are created
out of three primary colors of light:
red, green, and blue. The RGB his-
togram shows you the brightness
values for each of those primary
colors.
By checking the brightness levels of
the individual color components,
sometimes referred to as color channels, you can assess the picture’s color
saturation levels. If most of the pixels for one or more channels are clustered
toward the right end of the histogram, colors may be oversaturated, which
destroys detail. On the flip side, a heavy concentration of pixels at the left
end of the histogram indicates an image that may be undersaturated.
A savvy RGB histogram reader can also spot color balance issues by looking
at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to
notice just by looking at the image itself. And understanding how to translate
the histogram data for this purpose requires more knowledge about RGB
color theory than I have room to present in this book.
If you are a fan of RGB histograms, however, you may be interested in another
possibility: You can swap the standard Brightness histogram that appears in
Shooting Information playback mode with the RGB histogram. Just visit the
Playback menu, highlight the Histogram option, as shown in Figure 4-18, and
press the Set button to display the right screen in the figure. Select RGB
instead of Brightness and press the Set button again.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Less saturated
More saturated
Figure 4-17: The RGB histogram can indicate
problems with color saturation.

Figure 4-18: You can change the histogram type that appears in Shooting Information
playback mode.
Deleting Photos
When you spot a clunker image during your picture review, you can erase it
from your memory card in a couple of ways, as outlined in the next three 
sections.
Erasing single images
To delete photos one at a time, take these steps:
1. Select the image that you want
to delete.
If you are viewing images in
single-frame mode, just display
the image on the monitor. In Index
Display mode, use the cross keys
to move the highlight box over
the image thumbnail.
2. Press the Erase button.
It’s the one with the little trash
can icon, as shown in the margin
here.
Two options — Cancel and 
Erase — appear at the bottom of
the screen, as shown in Figure 4-19.
3. Highlight Erase and then press the Set button.
Your picture is zapped into digital oblivion.
91
Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Figure 4-19: Highlight Erase and press Set to
delete the current image.

92
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore
it by using data-restoration software. One memory card manufacturer,
SanDisk, even provides this type of software free on some of its memory
cards. You also can buy stand-alone programs such as MediaRecover ($30,
www.mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also $30, www.lexar.com).
But in order to have a chance at recovering deleted data, you must not take
any more pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the
current memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture
data for good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Erasing all images on your memory card
To dump all the pictures on the memory card, take this approach:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Erase Images, as shown on
the left in Figure 4-20.
Figure 4-20: Use the Erase option on the Playback menu to delete multiple images quickly.
2. Press the Set button to display the right screen in Figure 4-20.
3. Highlight All Images on Card and press the Set button.
After you press Set, you see a confirmation screen asking whether you
really want to delete all of your pictures. Select OK and press Set to go
ahead and dump the photos. (Note, though, that pictures that you have
protected, a step discussed two sections from now, are left intact.)
4. Press Menu to return to the Playback menu.
Or press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting pictures.

Erasing selected images
If you want to erase many, but not all, images on your memory card, you can
save time by using this deleting option:
1. On the Playback menu, highlight Erase Images and press Set.
You see the main Erase Images screen, as shown on the left in Figure 4-21.
Figure 4-21: You can delete multiple selected images at once.
2. Highlight Select and Erase Images and press the Set button.
You see the current image in the monitor. At the top of the screen, a little
check box appears, as shown on the left in Figure 4-22.
Figure 4-22: Use the up and down cross keys to check the box for images you want to delete.
Marked for deletion
93
Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting

94
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
3. Press the up or down cross key to put a check mark in the box and tag
the image for deletion.
If you change your mind, press the cross key again to remove the check
mark. The image then won’t be touched when you go forward with the
erasing process.
4. Press the left or right cross keys to view the next image.
5. Keep repeating Steps 3 and 4 until you mark all of the images that you
want to trash.
If you don’t need to inspect each image closely, you can display up to
three thumbnails per screen, as shown in the right image in Figure 4-22.
Just press the AE Lock button, shown here in the margin, to shift into
this display gear. Again, just use the up and down cross keys to mark
images for deletion, and use the right and left cross keys to advance
through your images.
To return to full-frame view, press the AF Point Selection button, shown
in the margin here. And if you need an even closer look, just keep press-
ing the button to switch to a magnified view. Use the techniques outlined
earlier in this chapter, in the section “Zooming in for a closer view” to
adjust the magnification power and scroll the display to view other
areas of the image.
6. Press the Erase button on the camera back.
Your see a confirmation screen asking whether you really want to get rid
of the selected images.
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format com-
mand, which lives on Setup Menu 1 and erases
everything on your memory card. What’s the dif-
ference between erasing photos by formatting
and by using the Erase Images option on the
Playback menu to delete all your pictures?
Well, in terms of pictures taken with your
Canon, none. But if you happen to have stored
other data on the card, such as, say, a music file
or a picture taken on another type of camera,
you need to format the card to erase everything
on it. You can’t view those files on the monitor,
so you can’t use the Erase Images feature to get
rid of them.
One final — and important — note: Although
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere
in this chapter) prevents the Erase function from
erasing a picture, formatting erases all pictures,
protected or not. Formatting also ensures that
the card is properly prepared to store any new
images you may take.

7. Highlight OK and press Set.
The selected images are deleted, and you’re returned to the Erase
Images menu.
8. Press Menu to return to the Playback menu.
Or, to continue shooting, press the shutter button halfway.
Protecting Photos
You can protect pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to delete a 
picture.
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures.
See the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a
camera with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other
people know that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make
room on the memory card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This
step isn’t foolproof, though, because anyone can remove the protected status
from an image.)
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a
“read-only” file when you transfer it to a computer. Files that have that read-
only status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy can
remove the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing
around with your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system.
Of course, you have to know how to remove the read-only status yourself if
you plan on editing your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Canon
ZoomBrowser EX, the free Windows-based software that ships with your
camera, you can do this by choosing File➪Protect. That command toggles
image protection on and off. In ImageBrowser, the Mac version of the Canon
software, choose File➪Get Info and then click the Lock box to toggle file-
protection on and off.)
Anyway, protecting a picture on the camera is easy. Just take these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Protect Images, as shown on
the left in Figure 4-23.

Using Your Monitor as a Viewfinder
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot camera — that is, one that’s not 
an SLR model — you may be used to composing your pictures on the camera
monitor rather than by looking through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact
cameras no longer even offer a viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my

picture is protected.

opinion. Why? Because when you use the monitor to frame the image, you
must hold the camera away from your body, a shooting posture that
increases the likelihood of blurry images caused by camera shake. When you
use the viewfinder, you can brace the camera against your face, creating a
much steadier shooting stance.
Due to some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, most digital SLR
cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your XSi/450D,
however, does offer that feature, known as Live View in Canon nomenclature.
But using your monitor as a viewfinder on your camera isn’t quite as simple
as when you use a point-and-shoot, non-SLR model — again, the difference is
due to the more involved design of an SLR camera.
Here are the important points to know before you experiment with Live View
shooting:
 Live View is available only in advanced exposure modes. That is, you
must set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode. Live View doesn’t
work in any of the other modes.
 Manual focusing is recommended. You can use autofocusing, but
manual focusing usually offers faster, more precise results. Chapter 6
covers the autofocusing methods available in Live View mode just the
same.
 You must set some capture settings before switching to Live View
mode. After you enable Live View, you can’t adjust the Drive mode 
(covered in Chapter 2), the Picture Style (Chapter 6), the AF Selection
Point, or the AF mode (both covered in Chapter 6). Of course, the latter
two options, which relate to autofocusing, don’t matter if you’re using
manual focus. 
 Some other functions are either disabled or limited in Live View
mode. Here’s the short list:
• Flash limitations: Flash Exposure lock, covered in Chapter 5, is 
disabled. In addition, non-Canon flash units will not work in Live
View mode.
• A-DEP mode: This mode functions the same as P (programmed
autoexposure), meaning that it no longer tries to achieve a depth
of field that keeps all objects in the frame in sharp focus. Chapter 5
explains more about these two modes; Chapter 6 details depth of
field and its creative impact on your pictures.
• Continuous shooting: You can use the Continuous Drive mode, intro-
duced in Chapter 2, but the camera will use the exposure settings
chosen for the first frame for all the images. 
• Metering mode: You cannot use Spot, Center-Weighted Average, or
Partial exposure metering; the camera always uses Evaluative
metering in Live View mode. Chapter 5 explains metering modes.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
• Custom Functions 9, 10, and 11: You can’t enable mirror lock-up
(Custom Function 9) in Live View mode. Also, any custom settings
that you apply to the shutter button and AE Lock button through
Custom Function 10 don’t work. Finally, the Set button is used to
switch Live View on and off, so it can’t perform any of the func-
tions that you may assign via Custom Function 11. (See Chapter 11
for details on all these Custom Functions.)
 Using Live View for an extended period of time can increase image
noise. When you work in Live View mode for a long time, the camera’s
innards heat up, and that extra heat can create the right electronic con-
ditions for noise, a defect that gives your pictures a speckled look.
Shooting at a high ISO speed or selecting a very slow shutter speed can
also produce noise. To avoid compounding the risk of noise when you
use Live View, set up your shot and then give the camera a brief cool-
down by turning off Live View for a few minutes. You can then return 
to Live View mode and capture the image. See Chapter 5 for more 
information about the other two potential causes of noise.
 You must be extra careful to keep the camera steady during the image
capture. Just as with a point-and-shoot camera, holding the camera 
out in front of you to capture the image can cause slight camera shake
that can blur your image. But with an SLR, the risk is greater because 
of the added weight of the camera and lens. And if you use a so-called
long lens — a telephoto or zoom lens that extends to a long focal 
length — the potential for camera shake is compounded. So for best
results, mount the camera on a tripod when you use Live View.
Live View also has the same two disadvantages that you get when you frame
with the monitor on a point-and-shoot camera: First, any time you use the
camera monitor, whether it’s for composing a shot or reviewing your images,
you put extra strain on the battery. So keep an eye on the battery status icon
to avoid running out of juice at a critical moment. Second, the monitor dis-
play can wash out in bright sunlight, making it difficult to use for composing
outdoor shots.
This laundry list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m advising you not to use Live
View, however — just that you shouldn’t envision it as a full-time alternative
to your viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can help in
shooting situations where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome.
I find Live View most helpful for still-life, tabletop photography, especially in
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, set

up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then there’s a
period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If I’m shooting
from a high angle, requiring the camera to be positioned above the table and
pointing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a stepladder to
check things out through the viewfinder between each compositional or light-
ing change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop height or below, I
have to either bend over or kneel to look through the viewfinder, causing no
end of later aches and pains to back and knees. With Live View, I can alleviate
much of that bothersome routine (and pain) because I can usually see how
things look in the monitor no matter what the camera position.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the next few sections show you
how to enable Live View and provide a brief introduction to the process of
Live View shooting. Also see Chapter 5 for details about monitoring and
adjusting exposure in Live View mode; check out Chapter 6 for Live View 
autofocusing options.
Enabling Live View
Before you can use Live View, you
must take these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP.
You can use Live View only in
these exposure modes. Chapter 5
explains them all; for now, choose
P (programmed autoexposure) if
you’re not familiar with the other
modes and you just want to
experiment with Live View.
2. Press the Menu button and 
display Setup Menu 2.
3. Highlight Live View Function Settings, as shown in Figure 4-25.
4. Press the Set button.
You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 4-26.
5. Select Live View Shoot and press the Set button again.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 4-26.
6. Select Enable and press Set.

through Setup Menu 2.

Figure 4-26: Select Enable and press the Set button.
7. Adjust the metering timing (optional).
By default, the exposure meter shuts itself off after 16 seconds when 
you work in Live View mode to conserve battery power. You can adjust
this timing through the Metering Timer option, shown on the left in
Figure 4-26. Highlight the option, press Set, and then select a time
option. Your choices range from 4 seconds to 30 minutes. Press Set 
once more after making your selection. (Chapter 5 talks more about the
purpose of the exposure meter.)
8. Press the Menu button to return to Setup Menu 2.
After you enable Live View shooting, just press Set to toggle the monitor pre-
view on and off. Note, though, that turning the monitor preview off does not
officially disable Live View mode; you must revisit the Live View Shoot option
on Setup Menu 2 to do that. (Don’t forget that while Live View is enabled, you
lose access to certain other camera features; see the preceding section for
details.)
Taking a shot in Live View mode
After you enable Live View, follow this approach to focus and record your
shot:
1. Check the setting on the Mode dial on top of the camera.
Remember, you must set the dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP to use Live
View. (Again, if you’re just experimenting, select P.)
2. Set the focus switch on your lens to MF (for manual focus).
You can use autofocusing in Live View mode, but focusing manually is
easier, faster, and may be more precise. If you do want to use autofocus,
Chapter 6 spells out how to do so; you can set up the camera for two
types of Live View autofocusing, each of which works a little differently.

Note that if you use a lens other than the kit lens sold with the Rebel
XSi/450D, the switch that shifts you to manual focus may sport a label
other than MF. Consult the lens manual for specifics.
3. If the camera is mounted on a tripod, turn off the Image Stabilizer 
feature.
As explained in Chapter 1, image stabilization isn’t necessary when you
shoot with a tripod. And because it consumes extra battery power, turn-
ing it off is a good idea for Live View tripod shooting with most lenses.
However, check your lens manual just to be sure: Some lens manufactur-
ers vary in their recommendations on this issue.
4. Press the Set button to switch from normal viewfinder operation to
the Live View preview.
Now you see your scene in the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-27. At the
bottom of the screen, you see data similar to what is displayed in the
viewfinder during normal shooting: shutter speed and aperture (f-stop),
the exposure meter, the number of shots remaining on the camera
memory card, and the ISO speed setting.
Figure 4-27: Place the center square over the point where you want 
to establish focus.
Also note the rectangle in the center of the screen, labeled Focusing
frame in Figure 4-27. That frame is provided as a way for you to verify
focus, as detailed in Steps 5 and 6.

You can display other information by pressing the DISP button; see the
next section for a look at your options.
5. Frame the shot as desired.
6. Press the cross keys to move the focusing frame over the spot where
you want to focus.
Or, to put the focusing frame smack in the middle of the screen, press
the Erase button (the one that sports the trash can symbol).
7. Turn the lens focusing ring to set initial focus.
On the kit lens, the focus ring is at the far end of the lens. (See Chapter 1
if you need help.)
8. Press the AF Point Selection button to magnify the view and refine
focus if needed.
By pressing the button, you magnify the area within the focusing frame.
Your first press of the button magnifies the view by five, as shown on the
left in Figure 4-28. The second press zooms you to ten times magnifica-
tion, as shown on the right. 
Figure 4-28: Magnify the preview to double-check focus.
In the lower-right corner of the monitor, you see a label showing the cur-
rent magnification level. Underneath that label, the box inside the small
rectangle indicates the portion of the overall frame that you’re viewing.
If needed, you can reposition the focusing frame to check another part
of the image by using the cross keys.
Adjust the focusing ring as needed to achieve just the right focusing dis-
tance. When you’re happy with the focus, press the AF Point Selection
button once more to return to full-frame view.
Magnified image area

9. Press the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure metering.
If needed, you can adjust exposure in P, Av, and Tv modes by using
Exposure Compensation, a feature covered in Chapter 5. In Manual (M)
exposure mode, you can adjust shutter speed and f-stop as usual. Again,
Chapter 5 spells out the details.
10. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.
You see your just-captured image on the monitor for a few seconds as
usual. Then the Live View preview returns, and you’re ready to take the
next shot.
11. To exit the Live View preview, press the Set button.
You’re returned to the standard Camera Settings screen. You can then
return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
Customizing the Live View display
You can alter a couple of aspects of the monitor display for Live View shoot-
ing, as follows:
 Display an alignment grid. When
you’re doing the kind of work for
which Live View is best suited,
such as taking product shots or
capturing other still-life subjects,
the exact placement of objects in
the frame can sometimes be
important. To assist you in that
regard, the camera can display a
grid on the monitor, as shown in
Figure 4-29. 
To display the grid, visit Setup
Menu 2, highlight Live View
Function Settings, and press the
Set button. Then highlight Grid
Display, as shown on the left in Figure 4-30, press the Set button, high-
light On as shown on the right in the figure, and press Set again. Repeat
the process and choose Off to lose the grid.
 Display shooting information. By pressing the DISP button, you can
superimpose a few additional bits of shooting information on the scene,
as shown in Figure 4-31. For the most part, the icons you see here are
the same as when you view shooting information in Playback mode, a
topic discussed earlier in this chapter. Here’s a brief review: 
• Drive mode: The icon you see in the figure represents the Single
Drive mode, in which you capture one image for each press of the
shutter button. See the end of Chapter 2 for information about
other Drive mode options.

• Exp.SIM: This symbol, which stands for exposure simulation, indi-
cates that the image brightness you see on the monitor is simulat-
ing the actual exposure you will record. If the symbol blinks or is
dimmed, as in the figure, the camera can’t provide an accurate
exposure preview, which can occur if the ambient light is either
very bright or very dim. Exposure simulation is also disabled when
you use flash in Live View mode.
• AE (autoexposure) lock and flash status: The asterisk tells you that
autoexposure lock is in force; a steady flash symbol tells you that
the flash is ready to fire. Neither symbol appears if you don’t use
these features for your shot. See Chapter 5 for information about
both features.
• Shutter speed and aperture (f-stop): See Chapter 5 for help under-
standing these options, too.
• Exposure meter: Yep, here’s another exposure feature covered in
Chapter 5.
• Flash Compensation: If you enabled Flash Compensation to adjust
the flash power, this symbol appears. Otherwise, the area of the
screen is empty. Chapter 5 covers this feature as well.
• Shots remaining: This number tells you how many pictures will fit
on the memory card at your current Quality setting.
• ISO speed: This setting controls the camera’s sensitivity to light;
see Chapter 5 for information.
• Battery status: A full battery icon like the one in Figure 4-31 says
you’re good to go.
 Display a brightness histogram. After pressing DISP once to reveal 
all the icons shown in Figure 4-31, press again to add a brightness his-
togram to the mix, as shown in Figure 4-32. See the section “Interpreting
a brightness histogram,” earlier in this chapter, to find out what the 
histogram can tell you.

can see isn’t accurate because it
doesn’t reflect the exposure as it
will be when the flash is used). 
If you switch to autofocusing in Live
View mode, what you see on the moni-
tor differs slightly than what you see
in the figures in this chapter. For

Taking Creative

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your camera to
automatic mode and let it handle most of the
photographic decisions, I encourage you to also
explore the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av,
M, and A-DEP). In these modes, you can make
your own decisions about the exposure, focus,
and color characteristics of your photo, which is
key to capturing an image as you see it in your
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a
genius or spend years to be successful — adding
just a few simple techniques to your photographic
repertoire can make a huge difference in how
happy you are with the pictures you take. 
The ﬁrst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing
some necessary photography fundamentals and
details about using the advanced exposure modes.
Following that, Chapter 7 helps you draw together
all the information presented earlier in the book,
summarizing the best camera settings and other
tactics to use when capturing portraits, action
shots, landscapes, and close-up shots.

y using the fully automatic modes covered in 
Chapter 2, you can take great pictures with your
Rebel XSi/450D. But to really exploit your camera’s
capabilities — and, more important, to exploit your
creative capabilities — you need to explore your
camera’s five advanced exposure modes, repre-
sented on the Mode dial by the letters P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP. 
This chapter explains everything you need to know
to start taking advantage of these five modes. First,
you get an introduction to the critical exposure con-
trols known as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Adjusting
these settings enables you to not only fine-tune image expo-
sure but also affect other aspects of your image, such as depth
of field (the zone of sharp focus) and motion blur. In addition, this
chapter explains other advanced exposure features, such as exposure com-
pensation and metering modes, and discusses the flash options available to
you in the advanced exposure modes. 

110
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you’re worried that this stuff is too complicated for you, by the way, don’t
be. Even in these advanced exposure modes, the camera provides you with
enough feedback that you’re never truly flying without a net. Between the in-
camera support and the information in this chapter, you can easily master
aperture, shutter speed, and all the other exposure features — an important
step in making the shift from picture-taker to photographer.
Kicking Your Camera into Advanced Gear
The first step to taking the exposure reins is to set your camera’s Mode dial
to one of the five shooting modes highlighted in Figure 5-1: P, Tv, Av, M, or A-
DEP. You also need to shoot in one of these modes to use certain other
camera features, such as manual white balancing, a color feature that you can
explore in Chapter 6. Each of the five modes offers a different level of control
over two critical exposure settings,
aperture and shutter speed. Later in
this chapter, I explain these controls
fully, but here’s a quick introduction:
 P (programmed auto): In this
mode, the camera selects both
the aperture and shutter speed
for you. But you can choose
from different combinations of
the two, which gives you cre-
ative flexibility not possible in
the fully automatic modes dis-
cussed in Chapter 2. 
 Tv (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure): In this mode, you select a
shutter speed, and the camera
chooses the aperture setting
that produces a good exposure.
Why Tv? Well, shutter speed
controls exposure time; Tv
stands for time value. 
 Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting — thus
Av, for aperture value. The camera then selects the appropriate shutter
speed to properly expose the picture.
 A-DEP (auto depth of field): Depth of field refers to the extent to which
objects at a distance from your subject appear sharply focused. One
way to control depth of field is to adjust the aperture setting. In this
exposure mode, the camera assesses the distance between the lens and
major objects in the frame and tries to choose an aperture setting that
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-1: You can control exposure and other
picture properties only in P, Tv, Av, M, and 
A-DEP modes.

keeps all those objects within the zone of sharp focus. Then the camera
sets the shutter speed appropriate for the aperture it selected.
Although this mode is a nice feature for photographers not yet schooled
in manipulating depth of field, it provides the least amount of photo-
graphic control of all the advanced exposure modes because you’re stuck
with whatever aperture and shutter speed the camera selects. In addition,
when you use flash or enable Live View shooting, you lose the automatic
depth-of-field feature, and A-DEP mode works just like P mode — but with-
out giving you the benefit of being able to select from different combina-
tions of aperture and shutter speed. So after you digest the depth-of-field
discussion in Chapter 6, I suggest that you practice using Av mode
instead, where you can select the aperture yourself. Keep in mind that
your camera offers a depth-of-field preview feature so that you can see in
advance whether the aperture setting is appropriate. Chapter 6 spells out
how to use the feature. 
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and
aperture. 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that are
designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with some
photographic flexibility. A-DEP mode removes aperture and shutter speed
control from your hands but enables you to adjust other picture settings,
such as white balance. Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands.
But even in Manual mode, the camera assists you by displaying a meter that
tells you whether your exposure settings are on target.
Again, I realize that the descriptions of these modes won’t make much sense
to you if you aren’t already schooled in the basics of exposure. If you are and
you just want to know the specifics of using these modes on your camera, flip
ahead to the section “Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed,” later in this
chapter. For details about the aforementioned exposure warnings and meter,
see “Monitoring Exposure Settings” instead. Otherwise, the next several sec-
tions provide you with the fundamentals you need to make good use of the
advanced modes.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, it’s
the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are two barriers, known as the aperture and
shutter, which together control how much light makes its way to the sensor.
111
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

112
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The actual design and arrangement of the aperture, shutter, and sensor vary
depending on the camera, but Figure 5-2 offers an illustration of the basic
concept.
The aperture and shutter, along with
a third feature known as ISO, deter-
mine exposure — what most of us
would describe as the picture’s
overall brightness and contrast.
This three-part exposure formula
works as follows:
 Aperture (controls amount of
light): The aperture is an
adjustable hole in a diaphragm
set just behind the lens. By
changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of 
the light beam that can enter
the camera. Aperture settings
are stated as f-stop numbers, 
or simply f-stops, and are
expressed with the letter f followed by a number: f/2, f/5.6, f/16, and so
on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, as illustrated
by Figure 5-3.
The range of possible f-stops depends on your lens and, if you use a
zoom lens, on the zoom position (focal length) of the lens. For the kit
lens sold with the Rebel XSi/450D, you can select apertures from
f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed all the way out to the shortest focal length
(18mm). When you zoom in to the maximum focal length (55mm), the
aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal
lengths.)
 Shutter speed (controls
duration of light): Set
behind the aperture, the
shutter works some-
thing like, er, the shut-
ters on a window. When
you aren’t taking pic-
tures, the camera’s
shutter stays closed,
preventing light from
striking the image
sensor, just as closed
window shutters pre-
vent sunlight from
entering a room. When
you press the shutter

button, the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the
aperture to hit the image sensor.
The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed and
is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so
on. Shutter speeds on the Rebel XSi/450D range from 30 seconds to
1/4000 second when you shoot without flash. Should you want a shutter
speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) exposure mode also provides
a feature called bulb exposure. At this setting, the shutter stays open
indefinitely as long as you press the shutter button down.
If you do use a flash, the fastest available shutter speed is 1/200 second;
the slowest ranges from 1/60 second to 30 seconds, depending on the
exposure mode. See the section “Understanding your camera’s approach
to flash,” later in this chapter, for details.
 ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800,
and so on. Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensi-
tivity, which means that less light is needed to produce the image,
enabling you to use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
On your camera, you normally can select ISO settings ranging from 100
to 1600 when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. (You lose the
option of ISO 100, however, if you enable the Highlight Tone Priority
function, which you can explore later in this chapter.) For the fully auto-
matic modes, you’re limited to ISO speeds from 100 to 800, and the
camera chooses the setting for you automatically.
Distilled to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that
strikes the image sensor.
 ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
As illustrated by the images in Figure 5-4, you can create the same exposure
with different combinations of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. And
although the figure shows you only two variations of settings, your choices
are pretty much endless — you’re limited only by the aperture range allowed
by the lens and the shutter speeds and ISO settings offered by the camera.

Figure 5-4: Aperture and shutter speed affect depth of field and motion blur.
But the settings you select impact your image beyond mere exposure, 
as follows:
 Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I intro-
duce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow
depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway
objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a
greater distance.
As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field.
As an example, notice that the background in the first image in Figure 5-4,
which I shot using an aperture setting of f/13, appears noticeably sharper
than in the right example, which was taken at f/5.6. Aperture is just one
contributor to depth of field, however; see Chapter 6 for the complete
story.
f/13, 1/25 second, ISO 200
f/5.6, 1/125 second, ISO 200

 Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion
cleanly. Compare the fountain water in the photos in Figure 5-4, for exam-
ple. At a shutter speed of 1/125 second, the water droplets appear much
more sharply focused than at 1/25 second. At the slower shutter speed,
the water blurs, giving it a misty look. How high a shutter speed you need
to freeze action depends on the speed of your subject, of course.
If your picture suffers from overall image blur like you see in Figure 5-5,
where even stationary objects appear out of focus, the camera itself
moved during the exposure. As you increase the exposure time (by
selecting a slower shutter speed), you increase the risk of this problem
because you have to keep the camera still for a longer period of time.
Most people enter the camera-shake zone at speeds slower than about
1/50 second, although some people have steadier hands than others.
Turning on image stabilization, available on some lenses, also helps
raise the odds of sharp handheld shots at slower shutter speeds. (On
the kit lens, turn the Stabilizer switch on the side of the lens to On to
enable this feature.)
My abilities vary depending
on the day and my caffeine
intake; I was able to snap
the first example in Figure
5-4 at 1/25 second, but
frankly, that was a lucky
accident as I usually can’t
handhold at speeds that
slow, even with image stabi-
lization. At the 1/5 second
used in Figure 5-5, camera
shake was almost
inevitable.
To avoid this issue, use a
tripod or otherwise steady
the camera. (If you’re not
using the kit lens, check the
lens manual to find out
whether you should turn off
image stabilization for
tripod shooting.) See
Chapter 6 for tips on solving
other focus problems and
Chapter 7 for more help
with action photography.

ISO increases, making the
image sensor more reactive

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called noise. This
defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to film
grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO film.
Ideally, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your camera —
ISO 100 — to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting con-
ditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture and
shutter speeds you need.
As an example, I shot the iris images in Figure 5-6 on a windy day. I
wanted a depth of field that was large enough to keep both the front and
back petals of the flower sharp but short enough to blur the back-
ground. An aperture setting of f/9 did the trick. But at f/9, I needed a
shutter speed of 1/50 second to expose the image at ISO 100. Because
the flower was moving quite a bit in the wind, 1/50 second was too slow
to capture it without blur, as shown in the left image. By raising the ISO
to 400, I was able to use a shutter speed of 1/200 second, which resulted
in the blur-free shot you see on the right.
Figure 5-6: Raising the ISO enabled me to increase the shutter speed and avoid blur.
ISO 100, f/9, 1/50 second
ISO 400, f/9, 1/200 second

Fortunately, you usually don’t encounter serious noise with the Rebel
XSi/450D until you really crank up the ISO. You’d have to look pretty close
to detect much noise in the ISO 400 image in Figure 5-6, for example. But
take a look at the examples in Figure 5-7, taken at ISO 800 and 1600. You
may be able to get away with ISO 800 if you keep the print or display size of
the picture small — as with other image defects, noise becomes more
apparent as you enlarge the photo. Noise also is more problematic in areas
of flat color. When you bump ISO all the way up to 1600, however, expect to
see noise throughout the image, as in the right photo in the figure.
Just to give you a better look at how ISO affects noise, Figure 5-8 offers
magnified views of an area of my ISO 100, 400, 800, and 1600 images, plus
an additional shot captured at ISO 200.
One more important note about noise: A long exposure time — say, 1
second or more — also can produce this defect. Your camera offers
built-in noise-reduction filters that aim to compensate for both high ISO
noise and long-exposure noise; see the sidebar “Dampening noise” else-
where in this chapter for details.
Figure 5-7: Very high ISO settings usually produce “noisy” images, which appear speckled.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-8: Noise becomes more visible as you enlarge your images.
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look of your
photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of your images.
(Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)
Doing the exposure balancing act
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed,
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the
same image brightness. If you want a faster shutter speed, for example, you
have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in more light
during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the camera
more sensitive to the light, or both. And as the preceding section explains,
changing these settings impacts your image in ways beyond exposure. So
when you boost that shutter speed, you have to decide whether you prefer
ISO 100
ISO 200

the shorter depth of field that comes with a larger aperture or the increased
risk of noise that accompanies a higher ISO. Figure 5-9 offers an illustration to
help you envision this 
balancing act.
All photographers have
their own approaches to
finding the right combina-
tion of aperture, shutter
speed, and ISO, and you’ll
no doubt develop your
own system as you become
more practiced at using
the advanced exposure
modes. In the meantime,
here’s how I handle things:
 I always use the
lowest possible ISO
setting unless the
lighting conditions 
are so poor that I
can’t use the aperture
and shutter speed I
want without raising
the ISO.
 If my subject is moving
(or might move, as
with a squiggly tod-
dler or antsy pet), I
give shutter speed the
next highest priority in my exposure decision. I might choose a fast shut-
ter speed to ensure a blur-free photo or, on the flip side, select a slow
shutter to intentionally blur that moving object, an effect that can create
a heightened sense of motion. When shooting waterfalls, for example, I
use a slow shutter to give the water a blurry, misty look.
 For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shut-
ter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in
mind. For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low f-stop
number) so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft back-
ground for my subject. For landscapes, I go the opposite direction, stop-
ping down the aperture as much as possible to capture the subject at
the greatest depth of field.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation will
make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for spe-
cific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and
ISO settings. And for specifics on selecting exposure settings in each of the
four advanced exposure modes, jump ahead to the section “Setting ISO, f-
stop, and Shutter Speed.”
Monitoring Exposure Settings
When you press the shutter button halfway, the current f-stop, shutter speed,
and ISO speed appear in both the viewfinder display, as shown in Figure 5-10,
and in the Camera Settings display, as shown in Figure 5-11. In Live View
mode, the exposure data appears at the bottom of the monitor and takes a
form similar to what you see in the viewfinder. (The upcoming sidebar shows
you the Live View screen and provides information about other exposure-
related aspects of shooting in Live View mode.)
In the viewfinder and
on the monitor in
Live View mode, shut-
ter speeds are pre-
sented as whole
numbers, even if the
shutter speed is set
to a fraction of a
second. For example,
for a shutter speed
of 1/500 second, you
see just the number
500 in the display, as
shown in Figure 5-10.
When the shutter
speed slows to 1
second or more, you
see quote marks
after the number in
both displays — 1"
indicates a shutter
speed of 1 second, 4"
means 4 seconds,
and so on.
The viewfinder, Camera Settings display, and Live View display also offer an
exposure meter, labeled in Figures 5-10 and 5-11. This little graphic serves two
different purposes, depending on which of the advanced exposure modes
you’re using:
Shutter speed
f-stop
Meter
ISO
Figure 5-10: The shutter speed, f-stop, and ISO speed appear in the
viewfinder.

 In manual (M)
exposure
mode, the
meter acts in
its traditional
role, which is
to indicate
whether your
current settings
will properly
expose the
image. Figure
5-12 gives you
three examples.
When the expo-
sure indicator
aligns with the
center point, as
in the middle
example, the
current settings
will produce a
proper exposure. If the indicator moves to the left of center, toward the
minus side of the scale, as in the left example in the figure, the camera is
alerting you that the image will be underexposed. If the indicator moves
to the right of center, as in the right example, the image will be overex-
posed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus or minus sign,
the greater the potential exposure problem.
 In the other modes (P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP), the meter displays the current
Exposure Compensation setting. Exposure compensation is a feature that
enables you to tell the camera to produce a brighter or darker exposure
than its autoexposure brain thinks is correct. When the exposure indica-
tor is at 0, as in Figures 5-10 and 5-11, no compensation is being applied.
See the upcoming section “Overriding Autoexposure Results with
Exposure Compensation” for details.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Because the meter is designated as an exposure compensation guide when
you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the camera alerts you to expo-
sure problems in those modes as follows:
 Av mode (aperture-priority autoexposure): The shutter speed value
blinks to let you know that the camera can’t select a shutter speed that
will produce a good exposure at the aperture you selected. You need to
choose a different f-stop or adjust ISO.
 Tv mode (shutter-priority autoexposure): The aperture value blinks
instead of the shutter speed. That’s your notification that the camera
can’t open or stop down the aperture enough to expose the image at
your selected shutter speed. Your options are to change the shutter
speed or ISO.
 P mode (programmed autoexposure): In P mode, both the aperture 
and shutter speed values blink if the light is such that the camera can’t
select a combination of the two that will properly expose the image.
Your only recourse is to either adjust the lighting or change the ISO 
setting.
 A-DEP mode (auto depth of field): Either the aperture or shutter speed
value may blink. If the shutter speed value blinks 30" (for 30 seconds) 
or 4000 (for 1/4000 second), the light is too dark or too bright, respec-
tively, for the camera to expose the image properly at any combination
of aperture and shutter speed. To compensate for dim lighting, you can
raise the ISO or add flash or another light source. In too-bright light,
lower the ISO if possible — otherwise, find a way to shade the subject 
or relocate it.
If the aperture setting blinks, the camera’s telling you that the exposure
will be okay, but the f-stop won’t produce the depth of field needed to
keep everything in the frame in sharp focus. (See Chapter 6 for complete
details on depth of field and the A-DEP mode.)
Exposure and Live View shooting
Your camera’s Live View mode, detailed at the
end of Chapter 4, enables you to use your mon-
itor instead of the viewfinder to compose your
images. If you do switch to Live View mode,
keep these exposure-related tips in mind:
 Your camera strap sports a little rubber
viewfinder cover that you should place over
the viewfinder . Otherwise, light can seep in
through the viewfinder and affect exposure.
 Several exposure-related functions are dis-
abled in Live View mode. You can’t use Flash
Exposure lock; you’re limited to Evaluative
metering mode; and you can’t adjust the
function of the AE Lock (autoexposure lock)
button. All three features are explained else-
where in this chapter. In addition, the A-DEP
exposure mode works the same as P mode
during Live View shooting.

One more word of advice: Keep in mind that the camera’s take on exposure
may not always be the one you want to follow. First, the camera’s exposure
decisions are based on the current exposure metering mode. As covered next,
you can choose three different metering modes, and each one calculates
exposure on a different area of the frame. Second, you may want to purposely
123
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 Image noise may be increased if you
engage Live View shooting for a long period
of time. This issue is related to the fact that
Live View causes the camera to heat up
more than usual.
 You can display certain exposure settings
along with your image in the monitor.
Chapter 4 tells you how to do so; the figure
here reminds you of where to find the criti-
cal exposure settings.
 In addition to the settings shown in the
figure here, you can display an exposure
guide called a histogram with your image.
Chapter 4 explains what a histogram can
reveal about your exposure settings.
 The image brightness on the monitor may or
may not reflect the actual image exposure
you can expect from the current exposure
settings. If the Exposure Simulation symbol
is white, the image brightness will be
approximately the same as what you see on
the monitor. But if the symbol blinks or is
dimmed, as in the figure, don’t rely on the
monitor for an exposure preview. In extreme
lighting conditions, the camera may not be
able to simulate exposure properly. And if
you use flash, exposure simulation is auto-
matically disabled.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
choose exposure settings that leave parts of the image very dark or parts
very light for creative reasons. For example, in a sunset scene, you may want
to choose exposure settings that leave the foreground very dark but capture
the fading colors of the sky properly. Again, depending on the metering
mode, the camera may not understand your creative intent and report an
exposure problem. In other words, the meter and the blinking alerts are
guides, not dictators.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
The metering mode determines which part of the frame the camera analyzes
to calculate the proper exposure. Your Rebel XSi/450D offers four metering
modes, described in the following list and represented in the Camera Settings
display by the icons you see in the margins:
 Evaluative metering: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then
selects an exposure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 Partial metering: The camera bases exposure only on the light that falls
in the center 9 percent of the frame. The left image in Figure 5-13 pro-
vides a rough approximation of the area that’s factored into the expo-
sure equation.
 Spot metering: This mode works like Partial metering, but is based on
the center 4 percent of the frame. The circle in the center of the
viewfinder, shown in Figure 5-13, indicates the metered area.
 Center-Weighted Average metering: The camera bases exposure on the
entire frame but puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center.
Figure 5-13: The spotlights here indicate the metering area for Partial metering and Spot 
metering.
Partial metering area
Spot metering area

In most cases, Evaluative metering does a good job of calculating exposure.
But it can get thrown off when a dark subject is set against a bright back-
ground or vice versa. As an example, in the left image in Figure 5-14, the
amount of bright background caused the camera to select an exposure that
left the statue too dark. So I switched to Partial metering, which properly
exposed the statue. (Spot metering would have produced a similar result
here.)
Of course, if your background is very bright and the subject is very dark, 
the exposure that does the best job on the subject typically overexposes 
the background. You may be able to tamp down those highlights slightly by
turning on Highlight Tone Priority, a Custom Function explored later in this
chapter.
Figure 5-14: In Evaluative mode, the camera underexposed the statue; 
switching to Partial metering produced a better result.
You can verify which metering mode is currently active by checking the
Camera Settings display. The left image in Figure 5-15 shows you where to
find the metering mode icon.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-15: Press the up cross key to access your metering mode options.
You’re restricted to Evaluative metering in the fully automatic exposure
modes. In the advanced exposure modes, you can specify a metering mode 
as long as you don’t enable Live View shooting, which also limits you to
Evaluative metering. To set the metering mode, follow these steps:
1. Press the up cross key.
The key is marked with the same little icon that represents Evaluative
metering mode. The monitor then displays the screen you see on the
right in Figure 5-15.
2. Press the up or down cross key to highlight your choice.
You can also rotate the Main dial to highlight the option.
3. Press the Set button.
Your selected metering mode remains in force until you change it.
In theory, the best practice is to always check the metering mode before you
shoot and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in
practice, that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one
more capture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more
capture setting.
So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other 
controls on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is
Evaluative metering. That mode produces good results in most situations,
Metering mode icon

and, after all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how 
the camera metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjust-
ing the exposure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes 
the whole metering mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot
with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and
background, as my examples here. Then, switching to Partial, Spot, or Center-
Weighted Average metering may save you the time of having to adjust the
exposure for each image.
Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed
If you want to control ISO, aperture (f-stop), or shutter speed, you must 
set the camera to one of the five advanced exposure modes. Formally 
called Creative Zone modes in Canon nomenclature, these modes include
programmed auto (P), shutter-priority autoexposure (Tv), aperture-
priority autoexposure (Av), manual exposure (M), and auto depth of field 
(A-DEP).
I explain each of these modes at the start of the chapter, but Table 5-1 offers 
a quick recap, along with a recommendation of when to use each mode. (In
the table, the initials AE stand for autoexposure.) The next sections provide
specifics (finally, you say) on how to adjust ISO, aperture, and shutter speed
in all five modes.
Controlling ISO
As explained at the start of this chapter, your camera’s ISO setting controls
how sensitive the image sensor is to light. At higher ISO values, you need less
light to expose an image.
Remember the downside to raising ISO however: The higher the ISO, the
greater the possibility of noisy images. See Figure 5-8 for a reminder of what
that defect looks like.
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera selects an ISO from 100 to
800, depending on the available light. You have no control over ISO in those
exposure modes.

depth of field needed to keep 
all objects in the frame in 
sharp focus.
In the advanced exposure modes, you have the following ISO choices:
 Auto: You can still rely on the camera to adjust ISO for you in the
advanced exposure modes if you prefer. The same parameters apply as
for the fully automatic exposure modes; that is, the camera chooses an
ISO setting from 100 to 800, depending on the available light. However, if
you set the Mode dial to M, for manual exposure mode, or enable the
flash, ISO is always set to 400.

 Specific ISO speeds: You can choose from five ISO speeds — 100, 200,
400, 800, or 1600 — unless you enable the Highlight Tone Priority func-
tion, which I cover later in this chapter. If you do enable that option, the
minimum ISO you can select is 200. 
The current ISO is displayed in the upper-right corner of the Camera Settings
display, as shown on the left in Figure 5-16. You can also monitor the ISO in
the viewfinder display and in the Live View display.
Figure 5-16: Press the ISO button on top of the camera to access the ISO setting.
To adjust the setting, just press the ISO button, located just behind the Main
dial, on top of the camera. You then see the screen shown on the right in the
figure. Use the cross keys or rotate the Main dial to highlight your choice.
Then press the Set button.
In Auto ISO mode, the Camera Settings display and Live View display initially
show Auto as the ISO value, as you would expect. But if you press the shutter
button halfway, which initiates exposure metering, the value changes to show
you the ISO setting the camera has selected for you. You also see the selected
value in the viewfinder rather than the word Auto.
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can adjust aperture and shutter speed only in P, Tv, Av, and M exposure
modes. In A-DEP mode, the camera forces you to use its selected exposure
settings. (You can, however, tweak the exposure by using the exposure-com-
pensation feature discussed in the next section.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-8), can occur
for two reasons: a high ISO speed and a long
exposure time.
The Rebel XSi/450D offers two noise-removal fil-
ters, one designed to help eradicate ISO-related
noise and another to dampen the type of noise
that occurs during long exposures. Both filters
are provided through Custom Functions, how-
ever, which means that you can access them
only in the advanced exposure modes.
To enable ISO noise reduction, visit Setup Menu
3, select Custom Functions, press Set, and then
use the right or left cross key to select Custom
Function 4, as shown in the left figure here. 
(The Custom Function number appears in the
upper-right corner of the screen.) Press Set
again to activate the options, highlight On, and
press Set again.
For long-exposure noise reduction, select
Custom Function 3 and press Set. You then can
choose from these settings, shown in the right
figure here. The options work as follows: 
 Off: No noise reduction is applied. This is
the default setting.
 Auto: Noise reduction is applied when you
use a shutter speed of 1 second or longer,
but only if the camera detects the type of
noise that’s caused by long exposures.
 On: Noise reduction is always applied at
exposures of 1 second or longer.
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware
that doing so has a few disadvantages. First, the
filter is applied after you take the picture, as the
camera processes the image data and records
it to your memory card. The time needed to
apply the filter is about the same as the original
exposure time, which slows down your shoot-
ing speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primarily
by applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t
expect this process to totally eliminate noise,
and do expect some resulting image softness.
You may be able to get better results by using
the blur tools or noise-removal filters found in
many photo editors because then you can blur
just the parts of the image where noise is most
noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or
little detail, such as skies.
Finally, if you enable ISO noise reduction, you
lose the option of enabling white balance brack-
eting, an advanced color feature you can
explore in Chapter 6.

To see the current exposure settings, start by pressing the shutter button
halfway. The following things then take place:
 The exposure meter comes to life. If autofocus is enabled, focus is also
set at this point.
 The current aperture and shutter speed appear in the viewfinder. If you
take your eye away from the viewfinder, the Camera Settings display
appears, and you can view aperture and shutter speed there instead. 
In Live View mode, the settings appear under the image preview on 
the monitor.
 In Manual exposure mode, the exposure meter also lets you know
whether the current settings will expose the image properly. In the other
advanced exposure modes — Tv, Av, P, and A-DEP — the camera indi-
cates an exposure problem not with the meter, but by flashing either 
the shutter speed or f-stop value. (See the section “Monitoring Exposure
Settings,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
The technique you use to change the exposure settings depends on the expo-
sure mode, as outlined in the following list: 
 P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera initially displays its rec-
ommended combination of aperture and shutter speed. To select a dif-
ferent combination, rotate the Main dial.
• To select a lower f-stop number (larger aperture) and faster shut-
ter speed, rotate the dial to the right.
• To select a higher f-stop number (smaller aperture) and slower
shutter speed, rotate the dial to the left.
 Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right for
a faster shutter speed; nudge it to the left for a slower speed. As you
change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the aperture
as needed to maintain the proper exposure.
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop,
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed —
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need 
to compromise on shutter speed (or, in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
 Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right to
stop down the aperture to a higher f-stop number. Rotate the dial to the
left to open the aperture to a lower f-stop number. As you do, the camera
automatically adjusts the shutter speed to maintain the exposure.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you’re handholding the camera, be careful that the shutter speed
doesn’t drop so low when you stop down the aperture that you run the
risk of camera shake. And if your scene contains moving objects, make
sure that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that
the camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur
it, if that’s your creative goal).
 M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Main dial to the right for a faster
shutter speed; rotate left for a slower shutter. 
• To adjust aperture: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation
button, shown in Figure 5-17, as you rotate the Main dial.
See the Av label next to the button? That’s your cue as to the 
aperture-related function of the button — Av stands for aperture
value.
Rotate the dial to the right for a higher f-stop (smaller aperture);
rotate left to select a lower f-stop. Don’t let up on the button as 
you rotate the Main dial — if you do, you instead adjust the 
shutter speed.
Figure 5-17: To set aperture in M mode, press the Exposure 
Compensation button as you rotate the Main dial.
In M, Tv, and Av modes, the setting currently available for adjustment
appears in purple, with little arrows at each side. Your camera manual 
refers to this display as the Main dial pointer, and it’s provided as a reminder
that you use the Main dial to change the setting. For example, in M (manual

exposure) mode, the shutter speed appears purple until you hold down the
Av button, at which point the marker shifts to the aperture (f-stop) value, as
shown in Figure 5-17.
Keep in mind that when you use P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the settings that
the camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you
don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to Manual
exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver
the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode, you
can tweak the autoexposure settings by using the feature explained in the
very next section.
Overriding Autoexposure Results 
with Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP exposure modes, you
can enjoy the benefits of autoexposure support but still retain some control
over the final, overall exposure. If you think that the image the camera pro-
duced is too dark or too light, you can use a feature known as exposure com-
pensation, which is sometimes also called EV compensation. (The EV stands
for exposure value.)
Whatever you call it, this feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a
darker or lighter exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is
appropriate. Best of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the
whole camera to understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +2.0 EV to –2.0 EV.
 A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment. 
 For a brighter image, you raise the EV value. The higher you go, the
brighter the image becomes.
 For a darker image, you lower the EV value. The picture becomes pro-
gressively darker with each step down the EV scale.
Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one full stop.
In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure compensation
setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the camera adjusts either the aperture or shut-
ter speed to allow half as much light into the camera as you would get at the
current setting. If you instead raise the value to EV +1.0, the settings are
adjusted to double the light.
133
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
By default, the exposure is adjusted in 1/3 stop increments. In other words,
you can shift from EV 0.0 to EV +0.3, +0.7, +1.0, and so on. But you can change
the adjustment to 1/2-stop increments if you want to shift the exposure in
larger jumps — from EV 0.0 to EV +0.5, +1.0, and so on. To do so, display
Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set. Then select
Custom Function 1, press Set, and press the up or down cross key to change
the setting. Press Set again to lock in the new setting. If you make this change,
the meter will appear slightly different in the Camera Settings display and
Live View display than you see it in this book. (There will be only one inter-
mediate notch between each number on the meter instead of the usual two.)
The viewfinder meter does not change, but the exposure indicator bar
appears as a double line if you set the exposure compensation value to a 
half-step value (+0.5, +1.5, and so on). 
Exposure compensation is especially helpful when your subject and back-
ground are significantly different in brightness. As an example, take a look 
at the first image in Figure 5-18. Because of the very bright sky in the back-
ground, the camera chose an exposure that left the palm tree too dark.
One way to cope with this situation is to adjust the exposure metering mode,
as discussed earlier in this chapter. I took the images in Figure 5-18 in
Evaluative mode, for example, which meters exposure on the entire frame.
Switching to Partial or Spot metering might have done the trick, but frankly, I
find it easier to use exposure compensation than to fool with metering mode
adjustments in most situations. So I left the metering mode alone and just
amped the exposure compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced the
brighter exposure on the right.
Some photographers use a slightly lower exposure compensation value —
say, EV -0.3 — for all of their shots. The thinking is that while this setting may
underexpose some images, resulting in a little necessary retouching work
later, it helps protect against blown highlights, which are usually not easy to
repair. (Be sure to also check out the Rebel XSi/450D’s Highlight Tone Priority
option, explained next, which also is designed to guard against lost high-
lights.)
Whatever your reason for adjusting the exposure compensation setting, you
can get the job done as follows:
1. Hold down the Exposure Compensation button.
The button’s located near the top-right corner of the camera monitor;
you can see the button in the margin here and in Figure 5-17. If the
Camera Settings display is active, the exposure meter becomes high-
lighted, as shown in Figure 5-19. Again, the purple highlight and the two
pointers at the edges of the highlighted area are there to remind you

that you can now adjust the setting with the Main dial. If you’re looking
through the viewfinder or shooting in Live View mode, the meter
appears as usual.
Figure 5-18: For a brighter exposure than the autoexposure mechanism chooses, dial in a
positive exposure compensation value.
2. While keeping the button pressed, rotate the Main dial to change the
exposure compensation value.
As you rotate the dial, the exposure indicator moves right or left along
the exposure meter.
• Rotate the dial to the left to lower the value and produce a darker
exposure. In Figure 5-19, for example, I dialed in a setting of EV –1.0.
• Rotate the dial to the right to raise the value and produce a
brighter exposure.
• To return to no adjustment, rotate the dial until the exposure indi-
cator is back at the center position on the meter.
3. Release the Exposure Compensation button after you select the value
you want to use.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
How the camera arrives at the
brighter or darker image you request
depends on the exposure mode:
 In Av (aperture-priority) mode,
the camera adjusts the shutter
speed but leaves your selected f-
stop in force. Be sure to check
the resulting shutter speed to
make sure that it isn’t so slow
that camera shake or blur from
moving objects is problematic. 
 In Tv (shutter-priority) mode, 
the opposite occurs: The camera
opens or stops down the aper-
ture, leaving your selected shut-
ter speed alone.
 In P (programmed autoexposure)
and A-DEP mode, the camera decides whether to adjust aperture, shut-
ter speed, or both to accommodate the exposure compensation setting.
However, the camera can adjust the aperture only so much, according to the
aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, too, is limited
by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those ranges, you either have
to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO.
One final, and critical point about exposure compensation: When you power
off the camera, it doesn’t return you to a neutral setting (EV 0.0). The setting
you last used remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP exposure modes
until you change it.
Holding on to Highlights
When a scene contains both very dark and very bright areas, achieving a
good exposure can be difficult. If you choose exposure settings that render
the shadows properly, the highlights are often overexposed, as in the left
image in Figure 5-20. Although the dark lamp post in the foreground looks
fine, the white building behind it has become so bright that all detail has
been lost. The same thing occurred in the highlight areas of the green church
steeple.
Figure 5-19: In autoexposure modes, the
meter indicates the exposure compensation
setting.

Figure 5-20: The Highlight Tone Priority feature can help prevent overexposed highlights.
Your Rebel XSi/450D offers an option that can help produce a better image in
this situation. It’s called Highlight Tone Priority, and you access it like so:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes.
You can take advantage of the Highlight Tone Priority feature only in
these modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 3.
3. Highlight Custom Functions, as shown on the left in Figure 5-21, and
press Set.
You’re taken to command central for accessing custom functions.

4. Press the right or left cross key as needed to display Custom Function
5 and then press Set.
Look for the Custom Function number in the upper-right corner of the
screen, as labeled in Figure 5-21. 
Note that the Custom Functions are grouped into four categories that
are assigned Roman numerals: Custom Function I, II, and so on. The cat-
egory number appears in the top-left corner of the screen. Group II, of
which Highlight Tone Priority is a member, contains Custom Functions
related to exposure. Knowing the group number isn’t important; just
don’t confuse that number with the actual number of the individual
Custom Function, which lives in the upper-right corner.
5. Press the up or down cross key to highlight the Enable option.
6. Press Set.
The Enabled option turns blue, as shown in the right image in Figure 5-21,
indicating that Highlight Tone Priority is now enabled and will remain on
until you revisit the Custom Functions playground again to turn it off.
Note a couple of small details about this feature:
 When you enable Highlight Tone Priority, the lowest available ISO setting
is 200 instead of the normal 100. This restriction occurs because part of
the way the camera favors highlights is to actually process the image at
an ISO value one step below your selected setting by applying exposure
compensation and other adjustments. These adjustments may result in
slightly more noise than usual in the shadow areas.
 As a reminder that Highlight Tone Priority is enabled, the zeros in ISO
value are displayed at a smaller than normal size in the viewfinder,
Camera Settings display, and Live View display, as shown in Figure 5-22.
Figure 5-21: Enable the feature through Custom Function 5 on Setup Menu 3.
Custom Function number

Figure 5-22: The small zeros in the ISO value indicate that Highlight 
Tone Priority is enabled. 
Disabling Auto Lighting Optimization
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera
automatically checks each picture for two potential exposure problems: a
too-dark subject and a lack of contrast. If it detects either, it automatically
applies a subtle corrective tweak as it records the picture to the memory
card. Canon calls this feature Auto Lighting Optimization. 
In general, Auto Lighting Optimization is a good thing, which is why the fea-
ture is also applied by default in the advanced exposure modes if you shoot
in the JPEG format. (Chapter 3 explains JPEG and the other available format,
Raw.) However, if you don’t want the camera making these adjustments, you
can turn off the feature. You might want to do so if you’re purposely trying to
shoot a backlit subject in silhouette, for example, or your artistic goal is a
low-contrast image.
In addition, the correction filter that’s applied by Auto Lighting Optimization
can make some other exposure-adjustment features less effective. So turn it off
if you don’t get the results you expect when you’re using the following features:
 Exposure compensation, discussed earlier in this chapter
 Flash compensation, discussed later in this chapter
 Automatic exposure bracketing, also discussed later in this chapter

To disable Auto Lighting Optimization,
visit Setup Menu 3, select Custom
Functions, and press Set. Then press
the right or left cross keys to hunt
down Custom Function 6, press Set,
and highlight Disable, as shown in
Figure 5-23. Press Set again to finish
the job.
Note that for all Custom Functions, the
option that appears in blue text is the
one that’s active.
Locking Autoexposure Settings
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For example, say that you set your camera to shutter-priority autoexposure
(Tv) mode and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second. When you press the
shutter button halfway, the camera reports the f-stop that it considers appro-
priate to expose the scene at that shutter speed. But if the light in the scene
changes or you reframe your shot before snapping the picture, the camera
may shift the f-stop automatically to compensate. 
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right settings
for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture the
image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of
exposure settings. Here’s one such scenario: Suppose that you’re shooting
several images of a large landscape that you want to join together into a
panorama in your photo editor. Unless the lighting is even across the entire
landscape, the camera’s autoexposure brain will select different exposure 
settings for each shot, depending on which part of the scene is currently in
the frame. That can lead to weird breaks in the brightness and contrast of 
the image when you seam the image together. And if it’s the f-stop that’s
adjusted, which is what could happen in P or Tv exposure modes, you may
notice shifts in depth of field as well because the aperture setting affects that
aspect of your pictures.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the same f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings for each
shot. In manual mode, the camera never overrides your exposure decisions;
they’re locked until you change them.
Figure 5-23: You can disable automatic 
exposure correction via Custom Function 6.

But if you prefer to stay in P, Tv, or
Av mode, you can lock in the current
autoexposure settings. Here’s how: 
1. Press the shutter button
halfway.
If you’re using autofocusing,
focus is locked at this point.
2. Press the AE Lock button, high-
lighted in Figure 5-24.
The AE stands for autoexposure.
Exposure is now locked and
remains locked for four sec-
onds, even if you release the 
AE Lock button and the shutter
button. To remind you that AE
Lock is in force, the camera 
displays a little asterisk in the
viewfinder and on the monitor
in Live View mode. If you need
to relock exposure, just press
the AE Lock button again.
One critical point to remember about using AE Lock: The camera establishes
exposure differently depending on the metering mode, the focusing mode
(automatic or manual), and on an autofocusing setting called AF Point
Selection mode. (Chapter 6 explains this option thoroughly.) Here’s the
scoop:
 Evaluative metering and automatic AF Point Selection: Exposure is
locked on the focusing point that achieved focus.
 Evaluative metering and manual AF Point Selection: Exposure is
locked on the selected autofocus point.
 All other metering modes: Exposure is based on the center autofocus
point, regardless of the AF Point Selection mode.
 Manual focusing: Exposure is based on the center autofocus point.
Again, if all of this focusing lingo just sounded like gibberish, check out
Chapter 6 to get a full explanation.
By combining autoexposure lock with spot metering, you can ensure a good
exposure for photographs in which you want your subject to be off-center,
and that subject is significantly darker or lighter than the background.
Imagine, for example, a dark statue set against a light blue sky. First, select
spot metering, so that the camera only considers the object located in the
141
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

Figure 5-24: You can lock the current auto-
exposure settings by pressing this button.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
center 4 percent of the frame. Frame the scene initially so that your statue is
located within the circle you see in the center of the viewfinder. Press and
hold the shutter button halfway to establish focus and then lock exposure by
pressing the AE Lock button. Now reframe the shot to your desired composi-
tion and take the picture. (See Chapter 6 for details on selecting an autofocus
point.)
Note that all of these bits of advice assume that you haven’t altered the func-
tion of the AE Lock button, which you can do via a Custom Function. You can
swap the tasks of the shutter button and AE Lock button, for example, so that
pressing the shutter button halfway locks exposure and pressing the AE Lock
button locks focus. Chapter 11 offers details on the relevant Custom Function.
Bracketing Exposures Automatically
One of my favorite exposure features on the Rebel XSi/450D is automatic expo-
sure bracketing, or AEB for short. This feature makes it easy to bracket expo-
sures — which simply means to take the same shot using several exposure
settings to up the odds that you come away with a perfectly exposed image.
When you enable AEB, your first shot is recorded at the current exposure set-
tings; the second, with settings that produce a darker image; and the third,
with settings that produce a brighter image. You can specify how much change
in exposure you want in the three images when you turn on the feature.
You can take advantage of AEB in any of the advanced exposure modes.
However, the feature isn’t available when you use flash. If you want to bracket
exposures when using flash, you have to do it yourself, either by using expo-
sure compensation or, in manual exposure mode, by changing the aperture
and shutter speed directly.
Speaking of exposure compensation, you can combine that feature with AEB
if you want. The camera simply applies the compensation amount when it
calculates the exposure for the three bracketed images.
One feature you may want to disable when you use AEB, however, is the Auto
Lighting Optimizer option. Because that feature is designed to automatically
adjust images that are underexposed or lacking in contrast, it can render AEB
ineffective. See the section “Disabling Auto Lighting Optimization,” earlier in
this chapter, for information on where to find and turn off the feature.
With that preamble out of the way, take these steps to turn on AEB:
1. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight AEB, as shown on the left in
Figure 5-25.

Figure 5-25: Auto exposure bracketing records your image at three exposure settings.
2. Press Set to activate the little exposure meter, as shown on the right in
Figure 5-25.
3. Press the right cross key to establish the amount of exposure change
you want between images.
After you press the right cross key, you see three exposure indicators
under the meter. These indicators show you the amount of exposure
shift in the three shots the camera will record. Each whole number rep-
resents one full exposure stop.
For example, if you use the setting shown in Figure 5-25, the camera
shoots one image at the actual exposure settings, and it then takes 
the second image using settings that allow half as much light into the
camera. The third image is recorded using settings that allow twice as
much light.
To reduce the amount of exposure shift, press the left cross key, which
moves the exposure indicators closer together.
4. Press Set.
AEB is now enabled. To remind you of that fact, the exposure meter in the
Camera Settings display shows the three exposure indicators to repre-
sent the exposure shift you established in Step 3, as shown in Figure 5-26.
You see the same markers in the viewfinder and in the Live View display.
How you actually record your trio of exposures depends on whether the
Drive mode is set to Single or Continuous. The Drive mode, which I introduce
in Chapter 2, determines whether the camera records a single image or multi-
ple images with each press of the shutter button. (Press the left cross key to
access the screen that enables you to change this setting.)
 AEB in Single mode: You take each exposure separately, pressing the
shutter button fully three times to record your trio of images. 
143
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you forget which exposure you’re taking, look at the exposure meter.
After you press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, the meter
shows just a single indicator bar instead of three. If the bar is at 0, you’re
ready to take the first capture. If it’s to the left of 0, you’re on capture
two, which creates the darker exposure. If it’s to the right of 0, you’re on
capture three, which produces the brightest image.
 AEB in Continuous mode: The camera records all three exposures with
one press of the shutter button. To record another series, release and
then press the shutter button again. In other words, when AEB is turned
on, the camera doesn’t keep recording images until you release the shut-
ter button as it normally does in Continuous mode — you can take only
three images with one press of the shutter button.
 Self-Timer/Remote modes: All three exposures are recorded with a
single press of the shutter button, as with Continuous mode.
Figure 5-26: The three bars under the meter remind you that 
automatic exposure bracketing is enabled.
To turn off auto exposure bracketing, just revisit Shooting Menu 2 and change
the AEB setting back to 0.
AEB is also turned off when you power down the camera, enable the flash,
replace the camera battery, or replace the memory card. You also can’t use
the feature in Manual exposure mode if you set the shutter speed to the Bulb
option. (At that setting, the camera keeps the shutter open as long as you
press the shutter button down.)
Auto exposure bracket indicators

Using Flash in Advanced Exposure Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add
more light. The built-in flash on your camera offers the most convenient solu-
tion.
To pop up the flash, press the Flash button on the side of the camera, high-
lighted in Figure 5-27. To turn off the flash, just press down on the flash
assembly to close it.
As you can in the fully automatic
modes, you also can set the flash to
Red-Eye Reduction mode. Just display
Shooting Menu 1 and turn the Red Eye
option on or off. When enabled, the
camera lights the Red-Eye Reduction
lamp on the front of the camera for a
brief time before the flash goes off in
an effort to constrict the subject’s
pupils and thereby lessen the chances
of red-eye.
The next section goes into a little 
background detail about how the
camera calculates the flash power
that’s needed to expose the image.
This stuff is a little technical, but it will
help you better understand how to get
the results you want because the flash
performance varies depending on the exposure mode.
Following that discussion, the rest of the chapter covers advanced flash fea-
tures, including flash exposure compensation and flash exposure lock. You’ll
find some tips on getting better results in your flash pictures as well. For
details on using Red-Eye Reduction flash, flip back to Chapter 2, which spells
everything out. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional
flash and lighting tips related to specific types of photographs.
Understanding your camera’s approach to flash
When you use flash, your camera automatically calculates and adjusts the
flash power to match the light on the subject. This process is sometimes
referred to as flash metering. Your Rebel XSi/450D uses a flash-metering
system that Canon calls E-TTL II. The E stands for evaluative; TTL, for through
the lens. And the II refers to the fact that this system is an update to the first
version of the system.

It isn’t important that you remember what the initials stand for or even the
flash system’s official name. But what is helpful to keep in mind is how the
system is designed to work.
First, you need to know that a flash can be used in two basic ways: as the 
primary light source or as a fill flash. When flash is the primary light source,
both the subject and background are lit by the flash. In dim lighting, this typi-
cally results in a brightly lit subject and a dark background, as shown on the
left in Figure 5-28.
With fill flash, the background is exposed primarily by ambient light, and the
flash adds a little extra illumination to the subject. Fill flash typically pro-
duces brighter backgrounds and, often, softer lighting of the subject because
not as much flash power is needed. The downside is that if the ambient light
is dim, as in my nighttime photo, you need a slow shutter speed to properly
expose the image, and both the camera and the subject must remain very
still to avoid blurring. The shutter speed for my fill-flash image was 1/30
second, for example. Fortunately, I had a tripod, and the deer didn’t seem
inclined to move.
Figure 5-28: Fill flash produces brighter backgrounds.
Flash as primary light source
Fill flash

Neither choice is necessarily right or wrong, by the way: Whether you want a
dark background depends on the scene and your artistic interpretation. If
you want to diminish the background, you may prefer the darker background
you get when you use flash as your primary light source. But if the back-
ground is important to the context of the shot, allowing the camera to absorb
more ambient light and adding just a small bit of fill flash may be more to
your liking.
One more note on flash: Although most people think of flash as a tool for
nighttime and low-light photography, most outdoor daytime pictures, espe-
cially portraits, also benefit from a little fill flash. As a case in point, Figure 5-29
shows you the same scene, shot at a farmer’s market on a sunny morning, cap-
tured with and without fill flash.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as illus-
trated in Figure 5-29. This color shift occurs because when you enable the
flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to com-
pensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually lit
primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual
white balance adjustment.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
So how does this little flash lesson relate to your camera? Well, the exposure
mode you use (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP) determines whether the flash operates
as a fill flash or as the primary light source. The exposure mode also controls
the extent to which the camera adjusts the aperture and shutter speed in
response to the ambient light in the scene.
In all modes, the camera analyzes the light both in the background and on
the subject. Then it calculates the exposure and flash output as follows: 
 P: In this mode, the shutter speed is automatically set between 1/60 and
1/200 second. If the ambient light is sufficient, the flash output is geared
to providing fill-flash lighting. Otherwise, the flash is determined to be
the primary light source, and the output is adjusted accordingly. In the
latter event, the image background may be dark, as in the left example in
Figure 5-28.
 Tv: In this mode, the flash defaults to fill-flash behavior. After you select
a shutter speed, the camera determines the proper aperture to expose
the background with ambient light. Then it sets the flash power to pro-
vide fill-flash lighting to the subject.
You can select a shutter speed between 30 seconds and 1/200 second. If
the aperture (f-stop) setting blinks, the camera can’t expose the back-
ground properly at the shutter speed you selected. You can adjust either
the shutter speed or ISO to correct the problem.
 Av: Again, the flash is designed to serve as fill-flash lighting. After you
set the f-stop, the camera selects the shutter speed needed to expose
the background using only ambient light. The flash power is then geared
to fill in shadows on the subject.
Depending on the ambient light and your selected f-stop, the camera
sets the shutter speed at anywhere from 30 seconds to 1/200 second. So
be sure to note the shutter speed before you shoot — at slow shutter
speeds, you may need a tripod to avoid camera shake. Your subject also
must stay very still to avoid blurring.
If you want to avoid the possibility of a slow shutter altogether, you can,
however. Display Setup Menu 3, select Custom Functions, and press Set.
Then select Custom Function 2, as shown in Figure 5-30. At the Auto set-
ting, the camera operates as just described. If you instead select the
1/200 second option, the shutter speed is always set to that value when
you use flash. This ensures that you can handhold the camera without
blur, but obviously, in dim lighting, it can result in a dark background
because the camera doesn’t have time to soak up much ambient light.
 M: In this mode, the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO setting you select
determine how brightly the background will be exposed. The camera
takes care of illuminating the subject with fill flash.

 A-DEP: You can use flash in this
mode, but doing so disables the
automatic depth-of-field feature.
The flash and exposure systems
then operate as described for P
mode. However, you can’t choose
from multiple combinations of
aperture and shutter speed as
you can in that mode; you’re
stuck with the combination that
the camera selects.
If the flash output in any mode isn’t to
your liking, you can adjust it by using
flash exposure compensation,
explained next. Also check out the upcoming section “Locking the flash 
exposure” for another trick you can use to manipulate flash results.
Keep in mind, too, that in any autoexposure mode, you can use exposure
compensation, discussed earlier, to tweak the ambient exposure — that is,
the brightness of your background. So you have multiple points of control:
exposure compensation to manipulate the background brightness, and flash
compensation and flash exposure lock to adjust the flash output.
Adjusting flash power with flash 
exposure compensation
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure in the current lighting
conditions. On some occasions, you may find that you want a little more or
less light than the camera thinks is appropriate.
You can adjust the flash output by using a feature called flash compensation.
This feature works similarly to exposure compensation, discussed earlier in
this chapter. But flash compensation affects the output level of the flash unit,
whereas exposure compensation affects the brightness of the background in
your flash photos. As with exposure compensation, the flash compensation
settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value) numbers. A setting of 0.0
indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the flash power to +2.0 or
decrease it to –2.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature — again, available only when 
you shoot in the advanced exposure modes — take a look at Figure 5-31. I
snapped these tomatoes during bright daylight, but they were shaded by a
tent awning. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a
little more light, but at normal flash power, the flash was too strong, blowing
out the highlights in some areas, as shown in the middle image. By dialing the
149
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Figure 5-30: You can limit the camera to a
fast shutter when using Av mode with flash.

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
flash power down to EV –1.3, I got a softer flash that straddled the line per-
fectly between no flash and too much flash.
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a flash
compensation of +2.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
Whichever direction you want to go with flash power, display Shooting Menu
2 and highlight the Flash Exp Comp option, as shown on the left in Figure
5-32. Press Set to activate the little meter and then press the right or left
cross key to specify the amount of flash compensation, as shown on the right
in the figure. A higher value increases flash output; a lower value reduces it. 
By the way, if you use flash exposure compensation a lot, you can customize
the camera so that pressing the Set button displays that control, saving you
the trouble of using the menus. Chapter 11 shows you how.
To let you know that flash compensation is in effect, the icon labeled in
Figure 5-33 appears in the Camera Settings display. You see the same
plus/minus flash symbol in the viewfinder and Live View display, although in
both cases without the actual flash exposure compensation value.
Figure 5-31: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower flash compensation setting.
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV –1.3

Figure 5-32: Adjust flash power via Shooting Menu 2.
As with exposure compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control.
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash. In addition,
the Auto Lighting Optimizer feature, covered earlier in this chapter, can inter-
fere with flash exposure compensation, so you may want to disable it.
Locking the flash exposure
You might never notice it, but when you press the shutter button to take a
picture with flash enabled, the camera emits a very brief preflash before the
actual flash. This preflash is used to determine the proper flash power
needed to expose the image.
On occasion, the information that
the camera collects from the preflash
can be off-target because of the
assumptions the system makes
about what area of the frame is likely
to contain your subject. To address
this problem, your camera has a fea-
ture called flash exposure lock, or FE
Lock. This tool enables you to set the
flash power based only on the center
of the frame.
Unfortunately, FE Lock is not avail-
able in Live View mode. So if you
want to use this feature, you must
abandon Live View and use the
viewfinder to frame your images.
Then follow these steps to FE Lock:

1. Frame your photo so that your subject falls under the center autofocus
point.
You want your subject smack in the middle of the frame. You can
reframe the shot after locking the flash exposure if you want.
2. Press the shutter button halfway down.
If you’re using autofocusing, focus is set on your subject, and the green
focus confirmation dot appears in the viewfinder. You can now lift your
finger off the shutter button if you want.
3. While the subject is still under the center autofocus point, press and
release the AE Lock button.
You can see the button in the margin here. The camera emits the pre-
flash, and the letters FEL display for a second in the viewfinder. (FEL
stands for flash exposure lock.) You also see the asterisk symbol — the
one that appears above the AE Lock button on the camera body — next
to the flash icon in the viewfinder. 
4. If needed, re-establish focus on your subject.
In autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button halfway down.
(You need to take this step only if you released the shutter button after
Step 2.) In manual focus mode, twist the focusing ring on the lens to
establish focus.
5. Reframe the image to your desired composition.
As you do, keep the shutter button pressed halfway to maintain focus if
you’re using autofocusing.
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
The image is captured using the flash output setting you established in
Step 3.
Flash exposure lock is also helpful when you’re shooting portraits. The pre-
flash sometimes causes people to blink, which means that with normal flash
shooting, in which the actual flash and exposure occur immediately after the
preflash, their eyes are closed at the exact moment of the exposure. With
flash exposure lock, you can fire the preflash and then wait a second or two
for the subject’s eyes to recover before you take the actual picture.
Better yet, the flash exposure setting remains in force for about 16 seconds,
meaning that you can shoot a series of images using the same flash setting
without firing another preflash at all. 
Exploring more flash options
Setup Menu 2, shown on the left in Figure 5-34, offers an option called Flash
Control. Through this menu item, you can customize a few additional aspects
of your camera’s built-in flash as well as an external flash head.

Figure 5-34: You can customize additional flash options via Setup Menu 2.
To explore your options, highlight Flash Control, as shown on the left in
Figure 5-34, and press Set. You then see the screen shown on the right in the
figure. Here’s the rundown of the available options:
 Flash Firing: Normally, this option is set to Enable. If you want to disable
the flash, you can choose Disable instead. However, you don’t have to
take this step in most cases — just close the pop-up flash head on top of
the camera if you don’t want to use flash.
What’s the point of this option, then? Well, if you use autofocusing in
dim lighting, the camera may need some help finding its target. To that
end, it sometimes emits an AF-assist beam from the flash head — the
beam is actually a series of rapid pulses of light. If you want the benefit
of the AF-assist beam but you don’t want the flash to actually fire, you
can disable flash firing. Remember that you do have to pop up the flash
unit to expose the lamp that emits the beam. You also can take advan-
tage of this option when you attach an external flash head.
 Built-In Flash Function Setting: If you highlight this option, as shown on
the right in Figure 5-34, and press Set, you display options related to the
built-in flash, as shown in Figure 5-35. The first option is unavailable for
the built-in flash. The other three affect the flash as follows.
• Shutter Sync: By default, the flash fires at the beginning of the expo-
sure. This flash timing, known as first-curtain sync, is the best
choice for most subjects. However, if you use a very slow shutter
speed and you’re photographing a moving object, first-curtain sync
causes the blur that results from the motion to appear in front of
the object, which doesn’t make much visual sense. 
To solve this problem, you can change the Shutter Sync option to
second-curtain sync, also known as rear-curtain sync. In that flash
mode, the motion trails will appear behind the moving object. The
flash actually fires twice in this mode: once when you press the
shutter button and again at the end of the exposure.
153
Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting

154
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
• Flash Exposure
Compensation: This setting
adjusts the power of the
built-in flash, just like the
option with the same name
that lives on Shooting Menu
2. For details, see the earlier
section “Adjusting flash
power with flash exposure
compensation.” You can set
this option on either menu.
• E-TTL II: This option enables
you to switch from the
default flash metering
approach, called Evaluative. In this mode, the camera operates as
described in the earlier section, “Understanding your camera’s
approach to flash.” That is, it exposes the background using ambi-
ent light when possible and then sets the flash power to serve as
fill light on the subject.
If you instead select the Average option, the flash is used as the
primary light source, meaning that the flash power is set to expose
the entire scene without relying on ambient light. Typically, this
results in a more powerful (and possibly harsh) flash lighting and
dark backgrounds.
 External Flash controls: The final three options on the Flash Control list
(refer to the right screen in Figure 5-34) relate to external flash heads;
they don’t affect the performance of the built-in flash. However, they
apply only to Canon EX-series Speedlites that enable you to control the
flash through the camera. If you own such a flash, refer to the flash
manual for details.
As you can probably discern from these descriptions, most of these features
are designed for photographers who are schooled in flash photography and
want to mess around with advanced flash options. If that doesn’t describe
you, don’t worry about it. The default settings selected by Canon will serve
you well in most every situation — the exception being flash exposure com-
pensation, which you can just as easily adjust via Shooting Menu 2.
Using an external flash unit
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external flash
head like the one shown in Figure 5-36. The figure features the Canon
Speedlite 580EX II, which currently retails for right around $350.
Although certainly not the cheapest of camera accessories, an external flash
may be a worthwhile investment if you do a lot of flash photography, especially
Figure 5-35: These advanced flash options
affect only the built-in flash.

portraits. For one thing, an external flash offers
greater power, enabling you to illuminate a
larger area than you can with a built-in flash.
And with flash units like the one in Figure 5-36,
you can rotate the flash head so that the flash
light bounces off a wall or ceiling instead of hit-
ting your subject directly. This results in softer
lighting and can eliminate the harsh shadows
often caused by the strong, narrowly focused
light of a built-in flash. (Chapter 7 offers an
example of the difference this lighting tech-
nique can make in portraits.)
Whether the investment in an external flash will
be worthwhile depends on the kind of photogra-
phy you want to do. However, if you simply
want a softer, more diffused light than your
built-in flash produces, you have another
option: You can buy a flash diffuser attachment
like the one shown in Figure 5-37. This diffuser,
made by LumiQuest (www.lumiquest.
com), sells for just $13 and is a heck of a lot
lighter and smaller to tuck into your camera bag
than a flash head. This is just one of many diffuser designs, so visit your camera
store to compare all of your options.
If you decide to purchase an external
flash, I strongly recommend that you
shop at a reputable camera store
where the personnel can help you
match the flash unit to your shooting
needs. You don’t have to buy a
Canon flash, but be aware that non-
Canon flash units do not operate in
Live View mode.
You may also want to dig into some
of the many books that concentrate
solely on flash photography. There’s
a lot more to that game than you
may imagine, and you’ll no doubt
discover some great ideas about
lighting your pictures with flash. You
can start with Chapter 7, which pro-
vides some specific examples of how
to get better flash results when you
shoot portraits, whether you go with
the built-in flash, an external flash,
or, my favorite, no flash.

T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s true,
this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s not
much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you
can’t make out whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to
focus than simply getting a sharp image of a subject.
You also need to consider depth of field, or the dis-
tance over which objects remain sharply focused.
This chapter explains all the ways to control depth
of field and also discusses how to use your Canon’s
advanced autofocus options.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of color,
explaining such concepts as white balancing, which
compensates for the varying color casts created by dif-
ferent light sources, and color space, which determines the
spectrum of colors your camera can capture. Finally, a sec-
tion near the end of the chapter introduces you to Picture Styles,
which enable you to take even greater control over image sharpness and
color.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re
not reading this book from front to back, the following steps provide a recap
of the basic process of focusing with your Rebel XSi/450D.
These steps assume that Live View shooting is not enabled — that is, you’re
using the viewfinder to frame your images, which is recommended in most
situations. (To find out why, read the introduction to Live View shooting at
the end of Chapter 4.) Focusing works a little differently in Live View mode;
see the upcoming section “Autofocusing in Live View Mode” for details.
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight.
Look through the viewfinder and pay attention only to the autofocus
points, labeled in Figure 6-1. Then nudge the dioptric adjustment knob
until the brackets themselves appear sharp — don’t worry about the
scene in front of the lens. (The knob is located just to the right of the
viewfinder; Chapter 1 details this step if you need more help.)
Figure 6-1: The viewfinder offers these focusing aids.
AF (autofocus) points

2. Set the focusing switch on the
lens to manual or automatic
focusing.
If you want to focus manually,
set the switch to the MF posi-
tion. For autofocusing, set the
switch to the AF position, as in
Figure 6-2. (These directions are
specific to the kit lens sold with
the Rebel XSi/450D, shown in
the figure. If you use another
lens, the switch may look or
operate differently, so check the
product manual.)
3. For handheld shooting, turn on
Image Stabilization.
For sharper handheld shots, 
set the Stabilizer switch on the
kit lens to On, as shown in
Figure 6-2. If you use another
lens that offers image stabiliza-
tion (it may go by another name, depending on the manufacturer), check
the lens manual to find out how to turn the feature on.
For tripod-mounted shooting with a non-Canon lens, the manufacturer
may suggest turning stabilization off, so check the lens manual. You
don’t need to turn the feature off for most Canon IS lenses, but you can
save battery power by doing so.
4. To set focus in autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button
halfway down.
When focus is established, the focus indicator in the viewfinder 
lights, and one or more of the autofocus points turns red, as shown 
in Figure 6-1. Focus is maintained as long as you continue to hold the
shutter button down halfway. (Press the button the rest of the way when
you’re ready to snap the picture.)
A red dot indicates an active autofocus point, which the camera will use
to establish focus. When multiple points turn red, all those areas will be
sharply focused. You can select a specific autofocus point by following
the steps laid out in the next section.
5. To set focus manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens.
Note that even in manual mode, you can confirm focus by pressing the
shutter button halfway. The autofocus point or points that achieved
focus flash for a second or two, and the viewfinder’s focus indicator
lights up.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your Rebel XSi/450D’s autofocusing system: the
active autofocus point and the AF (autofocus) mode. The next two sections
explain these features.
Selecting an autofocus point
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes (Full Auto,
Portrait, Landscape, and so on) as well as in A-DEP mode, all nine of your
camera’s autofocus points are active. That means that the camera’s auto-
focusing system looks at all the points when trying to establish focus.
Typically, the camera sets focus on the point that falls over the object closest
to the lens. If that focusing decision doesn’t suit your needs, you have two
options:
 Focus manually.
 Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In those modes, you
can tell the camera to base focus on a specific autofocus point.
Chapter 1 explains how to adjust focus manually. If you want to use auto-
focusing and specify an autofocus point, the following steps spell out the
process.
These steps assume that you are not shooting in Live View mode. I explain
the intricacies of Live View autofocusing a little later in this chapter, in the
section cleverly named “Autofocusing in Live View Mode.” However, some of
the autofocusing concepts involved in normal shooting also come into play
for Live View autofocusing, so familiarize yourself with these steps before
you jump to that discussion.
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to
the issues discussed in this chapter. Any move-
ment of the camera or subject can also cause
blur. Both of these problems are actually related
to shutter speed, an exposure control that I cover
in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7,
which provides some additional tips for captur-
ing moving objects without blur.

1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av,
or M.
Again, you can specify an auto-
focus point only in these expo-
sure modes. 
2. Press and release the AF Point
Selection button, highlighted
in Figure 6-3.
When you do, you see the AF
Point Selection screen on the
monitor. The display indicates
whether the camera is currently
in Automatic AF Point Selection
mode or Manual AF Point
Selection mode, as follows.
• Automatic AF Point
Selection mode: All the AF
points appear purple in
the monitor, as shown in
Figure 6-4.
• Manual AF Point Selection
mode: Only one of the nine
autofocus points is
selected and appears in
the monitor, as shown in
Figure 6-5. In the figure,
the center autofocus point
is selected, but you can
select any of the nine
points. (See the next steps
for how-to’s.)
You can check the current mode
by looking through the view-
finder, too. When you press and
release the AF Point Selection
button, all nine autofocus points
turn red if you’re in Automatic
AF Point Selection mode. A single point turns red if you’re in Manual AF
Point Selection mode.

Figure 6-4: In Automatic mode, all nine

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
3. To choose a single autofocus
point, set the camera to Manual
AF Point Selection mode.
You can do this in two ways:
• Rotate the Main dial. This
option is easiest when your
eye is up to the viewfinder.
• Press the Set button. Pressing
the button toggles you
between Automatic AF Point
Selection and Manual AF
Point Selection with the
center point activated.
4. Specify which AF Point you want to use.
Here again, you have two options:
• Rotate the Main dial. Rotating the dial cycles through the nine
points and then back to Automatic AF Point Selection mode.
• Press the cross keys. Just press the up, down, left, or right keys to
highlight the point you want to use. In this case, cycling through all
the options doesn’t switch you back to Automatic mode.
That’s all there is to it — after you select the autofocus point, just frame your
shot so that your subject falls under that point and then press the shutter
button halfway to focus.
If you want the benefits of autofocus but find it bothersome to have to worry
about selecting an autofocus point, try this approach: Set the camera to
Manual AF Point Selection and select the center point as the active point.
Remember, you can do this easily by just pressing the Set button in Step 3.
Now the camera will always set focus based on whatever is at the center of
the frame — a setup that, in my opinion, is the most intuitive way to do
things. If you want your subject to appear off-center, you still can: Just frame
the picture initially so that the subject is centered, depress the shutter
button halfway to establish focus, and then reframe the image before press-
ing the shutter button the rest of the way. 
Do be careful about exposure if you use this technique, however. If the expo-
sure metering mode is set to either Partial, Spot, or Center-Weighted Average
metering and you reframe the image so that your subject isn’t at the center 
of the frame, exposure may be off. To compensate, you may need to lock
exposure (using the AE Lock button) before you reframe. In Evaluative 
Figure 6-5: You also can base autofocus on a
single point.

metering mode, this issue shouldn’t be a big problem because exposure is
based on the entire frame. Chapter 5 provides details about metering modes,
autoexposure lock, and other exposure issues. 
Changing the AF (autofocus) mode
Your camera offers three different autofocusing schemes, which you select
through a control called AF mode. The three choices work like so:
 One-Shot: In this mode, which is geared to shooting stationary subjects,
the camera locks focus when you depress the shutter button halfway.
Focus remains locked as long as you hold the shutter button at that
halfway position.
 AI Servo: In this mode, the camera adjusts focus continually as needed
from the time you press the shutter button halfway to the time you take
the picture. This mode is designed to make it easier to focus on moving
objects.
For AI Servo to work properly, you must reframe as needed to keep your
subject under the active autofocus point if you’re working in Manual AF
Point Selection mode. If the camera is set to Automatic AF Point Selection,
keep the subject within the diamond-shape area covered by the nine auto-
focus points. (The preceding section explains these two modes.)
In either case, the green focus dot in the viewfinder blinks rapidly if the
camera isn’t tracking focus successfully. If all is going well, the focus dot
does not light up at all, nor do you hear the beep that normally sounds
when focus is achieved.
 AI Focus: This mode automatically switches the camera from One-Shot
to AI Servo as needed. When you first press the shutter button halfway,
focus is locked on the active autofocus point (or points), as usual in
One-Shot mode. But if the subject moves, the camera shifts into AI Servo
mode and adjusts focus as it thinks is warranted.
Which of these three autofocus modes are available to you, however, depends
on the exposure mode, as follows:
 In P, Tv, Av, and M modes, you can select any of the three AF mode
options.
 In A-DEP mode as well as in Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, and
Close Up modes, the camera restricts you to One-Shot mode.
 Sports mode always uses AI Servo autofocus.
 Full Auto and No Flash modes always use AI Focus.
The AI stands for artificial intelligence, if that helps.
163
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
So, assuming that you can choose from all three, which mode is best? Well,
here’s my take: One-Shot mode works best for shooting still subjects, and AI
Servo is the right choice for moving subjects. But frankly, AI Focus does a
good job in most cases of making that shift for you and saves you the trouble
of having to change the mode each time you go from shooting still to moving
subjects. So, in my mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting
unless you’re shooting moving objects and want to be able to lock focus at a
specific position — in which case, my
recommendation would be to simply
switch to manual focusing anyway.
Whatever you decide, you can set the
AF mode as follows:
1. Press the right cross key (the
one labeled AF).
The monitor displays the screen
you see in Figure 6-6.
2. Press the left or right cross keys
to highlight your choice.
3. Press the Set button.
Autofocusing in Live View Mode
Chapter 4 covers the basics of shooting in Live View mode, which enables
you to compose your shots by using the camera monitor instead of the
viewfinder. As I mention in that discussion, using this photography mode on
a digital SLR isn’t as simple as it is on a compact point-and-shoot model
because of the complexities of SLR design. On the Rebel XSi/450D, shooting in
Live View mode requires some tradeoffs, such as not being able to use cer-
tain exposure features or any of the automatic exposure modes (Full Auto,
Portrait, and so on).
As for focusing, the simplest and usually most reliable choice is to focus 
manually, and the Chapter 4 guide to Live View shooting explains the steps
involved in doing just that. (The process is a little different in Live View mode
than when you use the viewfinder to preview your shots.)
You can use autofocusing in Live View mode, however. In fact, you have 
your choice of two autofocusing methods: Quick mode and Live mode. 
(Hint: Quick mode is the most convenient of the two.)
The next three sections explain the art of autofocusing in Live View mode.
Before you move on to those sections, though, note the following limitations
of autofocusing in Live View mode:
Figure 6-6: Press the right cross key to 
display the AF mode options.

 Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. You can set the AF mode to AI
Servo, but even if you do, the camera behaves as if you instead selected
the One-Shot option. In other words, the camera won’t track focus on a
moving subject during Live View shooting.
 Autoexposure and autofocus are set and locked together. When you
autofocus in Live View mode, you don’t press the shutter button halfway
to lock focus as you normally do. Instead, you focus by pressing the AE
Lock button — which also locks autoexposure, as explained in Chapter
5. If you want to lock exposure and focus separately in Live View mode,
you have to reset the function of the AE Lock button.
You do this through Custom Function 10, which you can explore fully in
Chapter 11. For the purpose of Live View autofocusing, select option 1,
AE Lock/AF. After you do, you lock autoexposure by using the shutter
button and lock autofocus by pressing the AE Lock button. (Trust me,
however, that simply focusing manually is much simpler than this con-
voluted process. And don’t make this change to the button functions
while working with this book, or things won’t work as described.)
 Autofocusing isn’t possible with remote-control shooting. If you want
to control the camera with a remote unit, either switch to manual focus-
ing or don’t enable Live View.
Enabling Live View autofocusing
By default, autofocusing is disabled for Live View shooting. If you want to 
autofocus, take these steps:
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
You can’t use Live View in any other mode.
2. Display Setup Menu 3 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on
the left in Figure 6-7.

3. Press Set and then press the right or left cross key to navigate to
Custom Function 8.
The Custom Function number appears in the upper-right corner of the
screen. You should see options shown on the right in Figure 6-7.
4. Press Set again to activate the options list.
5. Highlight your choice of autofocusing modes and then press Set.
The next two sections explain the difference between Quick mode and
Live mode autofocusing. After you press Set, your selected option
appears in blue text in the menu, as shown on the right in Figure 6-7.
(The blue always indicates the selected option for Custom Functions.)
Live View autofocus option 1: Quick mode
As its name implies, the Quick mode offers the fastest autofocusing during
Live View shooting. Here’s how it works:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes 
(P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
But remember that in Live View mode, the automatic depth-of-field 
feature supplied by the A-DEP mode is disabled, and the camera oper-
ates as it does when set to P (programmed autoexposure). See Chapter 5
if you can’t remember the difference between these two autoexposure
settings.
2. Select Quick mode for Custom Function 8, as explained in the preced-
ing section.
3. Set the AF mode to One-Shot.
To do so, press the right cross key to access the AF mode settings.
Highlight One-Shot and press Set. 
You can use the other two AF mode settings, but the camera can’t adjust
focus to track moving subjects in those modes as it normally can. In
addition, the other two settings can slow the autofocusing process.
4. Set the desired autofocus point.
You do this by pressing the AF Point Selection button and then using the
techniques spelled out earlier in this chapter, in the section “Selecting
an autofocus point.”
5. Press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting mode.
You can then release the shutter button.
6. Press Set to engage the Live View preview.
Now you see your subject on the monitor, along with either two or 
10 rectangles, as shown in Figure 6-8. Here’s the scoop:

• The large rectangle is the focusing frame that appears anytime you
use Live View. It becomes involved in autofocusing if you choose to
magnify the image display to check focus, as spelled out in Step 10.
• The small rectangles represent the autofocus points. If you’re 
using Automatic AF Point Selection, all nine points appear, as in
Figure 6-8. If you’re using Manual AF Point Selection, you see only a
single small rectangle that represents your chosen autofocus point.
Figure 6-8: The small rectangles represent autofocus points; the large 
rectangle, the Live View focusing frame.
7. Frame your shot so that an autofocus point falls over your subject.
Again, the small rectangle (or rectangles) represent the autofocus
point(s).
8. Press and hold the AE Lock button until you hear a beep.
As soon as you press the button, the monitor turns black, and the auto-
focusing mechanism kicks into gear. Keep pressing the button until the
camera beeps at you. The beep signals you that focus is set.
In P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP modes, the autoexposure system fires up and locks
exposure settings along with focus.
9. When focus is set, release the AE Lock button.
The live image reappears on the monitor.

10. Verify focus (optional).
You can magnify the Live View display to double-check focus if you
want. First press the cross keys to move the large focusing frame (refer
to Figure 6-8) over the area of interest. Then press the AF Point Selection
button to magnify the area inside the frame. Your first press displays a 
5-times magnified view; press again for a 10-times magnification.
If focus is off, you can try reframing the scene and repeating Step 8 —
that is, press and hold the AE Lock button until you hear the beep that
indicates that focus has been reestablished. You can’t, however, select a
different AF point without exiting from Live View mode. To do so, press
the Set button. You then can repeat Steps 4 through 6 to change the AF
point and return to Live View mode.
When you’re satisfied with focus, press the AF Point Selection button
again to return to the normal display magnification.
11. Press the shutter button to take the picture.
Because the shutter button doesn’t affect autofocus, as it does when
you’re not using Live View mode, you don’t have to use the normal two-
stage button press. You can press that baby all in a single motion. (But
press, don’t jab, or you may shake the camera and cause image blur.)
Live View autofocus option 2: Live mode
Live mode autofocusing enables you to select an autofocus point without
exiting Live View shooting mode, an option you don’t get with Quick mode
autofocusing.
On the very significant downside, however, Live mode autofocusing is notice-
ably slower than Quick mode, and the camera may have more trouble finding
the focus point than in Quick mode. (The difference is due to the autofocus-
ing system that the camera employs.)
To compare the two modes, first visit Custom Function 8, on Setup Menu 3,
and select Live mode from the list of options, as explained in the earlier sec-
tion, “Enabling Live View autofocusing.” Then set focus as follows:
1. Press Set to switch to Live View mode.
Remember, in order to use Live View, you must use one of the advanced
exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
After you press Set, your subject appears on the monitor. This time, you
see just the large rectangular focusing frame, labeled in Figure 6-8, with-
out the smaller autofocus point or points.
2. Position the focusing frame over the area on which you want to focus.
You can move the focusing frame by pressing the cross keys.

3. Press and hold the AE Lock button.
The camera attempts to establish focus and also sets exposure, if you’re
using any exposure mode but M (manual).
4. When the focus indicator turns green and you hear a beep, release
the AE Lock button.
The indicator and the beep are the camera’s signals to you that focus
has been established, and in the autoexposure modes, that exposure has
been set as well.
If the focus indicator lamp instead turns orange, the camera can’t estab-
lish focus. The best option here is to switch to manual focusing. (See the
instructions in Chapter 4 for help with manual focusing in Live View
mode.)
5. Verify focus (optional).
To zoom in on the area inside the focusing frame and check focus, press
the AF Selection Point button. Press once to zoom to a 5-times magnifica-
tion; press again to display the scene at 10-times magnification. You can
press the cross keys to shift the position of the focusing frame to inspect
another area of the image.
If focus appears off, you can press the AE Lock button again to restart
autofocusing. Again, wait for the beep and green focus indicator to
release the button.
When you’re happy with focus, press the AF Point Selection button once
more to return to normal, non-magnified view.
6. Press the shutter button to take the picture.
Although this option may seem like the easiest way to shoot in Live View
mode, I suspect that you’ll find that it’s actually the least successful because
of the length of time the camera needs to establish focus — assuming that it
can do so at all. Once again, if you enjoy Live View shooting, I strongly
encourage you to opt out of autofocusing and instead use the manual focus-
ing technique explored in Chapter 4.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer
home the lesson:
 Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph
appear sharply focused.
169
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

170
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 With a shallow, or small, depth of field, only your subject and objects
very close to it appear sharp. Objects at a distance from the subject
appear blurry.
 With a large depth of field, the zone of sharp focus extends to include
distant objects.
Which arrangement works best depends entirely on your creative vision and
your subject. In portraits, for example, a classic technique is to use a short
depth of field, as I did for the photo in Figure 6-9. This approach increases
emphasis on the subject while diminishing the impact of the background. But
for the photo shown in Figure 6-10, I wanted the historical marker, the light-
house, and the cottage behind to have equal weight in the scene, so I used
settings that produced a large depth of field, keeping them all in sharp focus.
Note, though, that with a short depth of field, you can just as easily throw
foreground objects into soft focus as background objects. In the lighthouse
scene, for example, if I had used settings that produced a short depth of field
and I set focus on the lighthouse, the historical marker and the cottage both
might be outside the zone of sharp focus.
Figure 6-9: A shallow depth of field blurs the background 
and draws added attention to the subject.
Shallow depth of field

So how do you adjust depth of field?
You have three points of control, as
follows:
 Aperture setting (f-stop): The
aperture is one of three expo-
sure settings, all explained fully
in Chapter 5. Depth of field
increases as you stop down the
aperture (by choosing a higher 
f-stop number). For shallow
depth of field, open the aperture
(by choosing a lower f-stop
number).
Figure 6-11 offers an example.
Notice that the trees in the back-
ground are much more softly
focused in the f/5.6 example
than in the f/11 version. Of
course, changing the aperture
requires adjusting the shutter
speed or ISO to maintain the
equivalent exposure; for these
images, I adjusted shutter speed.
 Lens focal length: In lay terms,
focal length determines what the
lens “sees.” As you increase
focal length, measured in mil-
limeters, the angle of view nar-
rows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the important point for
this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, the spatial rela-
tionship of objects changes as you adjust focal length.
As an example, Figure 6-12 compares the same scene shot at focal
lengths of 138mm and 255mm. I used the same aperture, f/22, for both
examples.
Whether you have any focal-length flexibility depends on your lens: If
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in or
out. (The Rebel XSi/450D kit lens, for example, offers a focal range of
18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is fixed, so
scratch this means of manipulating depth of field.
For more technical details about focal length and your camera, see the
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”

f/5.6, 1/1000 second
f/11, 1/200 second

 Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do,
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-13
and summed up in the following list:
 To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide as
possible (select the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum
focal length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the
highest possible f-stop setting, zoom out to the shortest focal length
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
Figure 6-13: Aperture, focal length, and your shooting distance determine depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 When depth of field is a primary concern, try using aperture-priority
autoexposure (Av). In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends
on your lens.
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject

Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range
of focal lengths it offers. Measured in millime-
ters, focal length determines the camera’s angle
of view, the apparent size and distance of
objects in the scene, and depth of field.
According to photography tradition, a focal
length of about 50mm is a “normal” lens. Most
point-and-shoot cameras feature this focal
length, which is a medium-range lens that
works well for the type of snapshots that users
of those kinds of cameras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is char-
acterized as a wide-angle lens because at that
focal length, the camera has a wide angle of
view and produces a long depth of field, making
it good for landscape photography. A short focal
length also has the effect of making objects
seem smaller and farther away. At the other end
of the spectrum, a lens with a focal length
longer than about 80mm is considered a tele-
photo lens and often referred to as a long lens.
With a long lens, angle of view narrows, depth
of field decreases, and faraway subjects appear
closer and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and
sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called
35mm equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal:
For reasons that aren’t really important, when
you put a standard lens on most digital cameras,
including your Rebel XSi/450D, the available
frame area is reduced, as if you took a picture
on a camera that uses 35mm film negatives (the
kind you’ve probably been using for years) and
then cropped it.
Chuck Pace

 Some of the fully automatic scene modes are also designed with depth of
field in mind. Portrait and Close-Up modes produce shortened depth of
field; Landscape mode produces a greater depth of field. You can’t
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the setting
the camera chooses. And in certain lighting conditions, the camera may
not be able to choose an aperture that produces the depth of field you
expect from the selected mode.
 The Rebel XSi/450D also offers a special autoexposure mode called 
A-DEP, which stands for automatic depth of field. In this mode, the
camera selects the aperture setting that it thinks will keep all objects in
the frame within the zone of sharp focus. You can read more about this
mode in the next section.
 Not sure which aperture setting you need to produce the depth of field
you want? Good news: Your camera offers depth-of-field preview, which
enables you to see in advance how the aperture affects the focus zone.
See the section labeled “Checking depth of field” for details on how to
use this feature.
 The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust depth of field
also is affected by the distance between the subject and the background.
For increased background blurring, move the subject farther in front of
the background.
 If you adjust aperture to affect depth of field, be sure to always keep an
eye on shutter speed as well. To maintain the same exposure, shutter
speed must change in tandem with aperture, and you may encounter a
situation where the shutter speed is too slow to permit hand-holding of
the camera. Lenses that offer optical image stabilization do enable most
people to handhold the camera at slower shutter speeds than non-stabi-
lized lenses, but double-check your results just to be sure. 
175
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also
called the magnification factor, varies depend-
ing on the digital camera, which is why the
photo industry adopted the 35mm-equivalent
measuring stick as a standard. With your
camera, the cropping factor is roughly 1.6. So
the 18–55mm kit lens sold with the Rebel
XSi/450D, for example, actually captures the
approximate area you would get from a
27–82mm lens on a 35mm film camera. In the
figure here, for example, the red outline indi-
cates the image area that results from the 1.6
crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is
required.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Using A-DEP mode
In addition to the four advanced exposure
modes found on most digital SLR cameras, your
Rebel XSi/450D offers a fifth mode called A-DEP,
as shown in Figure 6-14. The initials stand for
automatic depth of field.
This mode is designed to assist you in produc-
ing photos that have a depth of field sufficient
to keep all objects in the frame in sharp focus.
The camera accomplishes this by analyzing the
lens-to-subject distance for all those objects and
then selecting the aperture that results in the
appropriate depth of field. After choosing the
aperture, the camera then selects the necessary
shutter speed to properly expose the image at
the selected f-stop.
A-DEP mode isn’t a surefire bet, however, and it does have some restrictions
that may make it unsuitable for your subject. Here’s what you need to know:
 In very dim lighting, the shutter speed the camera selects may be too
slow to allow you to handhold the camera. So check the shutter speed in
the viewfinder after you press the shutter button halfway to meter and
focus the image.
 If the aperture value blinks in the viewfinder, the camera can’t set the 
f-stop so that you get both a good exposure and the depth of field neces-
sary to keep all objects in the frame in sharp focus. In this situation, the
camera assumes that your primary goal is a good exposure and so
adjusts the aperture as needed based on the available light.
 If the shutter speed blinks in the viewfinder, the light is either too bright
or too dim for the camera to properly expose the image at any combina-
tion of aperture and shutter speed. In bright light, you can lower the ISO,
if it isn’t already at 100, or reposition or shade your subject. In dim light-
ing, raise the ISO or add artificial light.
 You can use flash with A-DEP mode, but the minute you turn on the
flash, the camera no longer does its automatic depth-of-field calculation.
The same thing occurs if you switch to Live View shooting. In either
case, the camera simply presents you with a fixed combination of aper-
ture and shutter speed that will properly expose the image. The depth of
field may or may not be what you want.
Given these limitations, my personal recommendation is that as soon as 
you fully understand the impact of aperture on depth of field, you politely
decline the option of using A-DEP mode and instead work in aperture-priority
Figure 6-14: A-DEP stands for
automatic depth of field.

autoexposure mode (Av) instead. Then you can simply match the f-stop to
the depth of field you have in mind, without giving up the option of using
flash or Live View shooting.
Checking depth of field
When you look through your viewfinder and press the shutter button
halfway, you can get only a partial indication of the depth of field that your
current camera settings will produce. You can see the effect of focal length
and the camera-to-subject distance, but because the aperture doesn’t actu-
ally open to your selected f-stop until you take the picture, the viewfinder
doesn’t show you how that setting will affect depth of field.
By using the Depth-of-Field Preview button on your camera, however, you can
do just that. Almost hidden away on the front of your camera, the button is
labeled in Figure 6-15.
Figure 6-15: Press this button to see how the aperture setting will affect depth of field.
To use this feature, just press and hold the shutter button halfway down and
then press and hold the Depth-of-Field Preview button with the other hand.
Depending on the selected f-stop, the scene in the viewfinder may then get
either brighter or darker. Or in Live View mode, the same thing happens in
the monitor preview.

Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

178
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
After the preview engages, you can release the shutter button and then rotate
the Main dial to see how changing the f-stop affects the depth of field. (The
exception is when the camera is set to A-DEP mode, in which you have no
control over aperture.)
Note that the preview doesn’t engage in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode if your cur-
rent aperture and shutter speed aren’t adequate to expose the image prop-
erly. You have to solve the exposure issue before you can use the preview.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — resolu-
tion, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making sense of
your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems aren’t all
that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with a quick
shift of your camera’s white balance control. And getting a grip on color
requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs for an
endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control,
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your
camera renders colors. For information on how to alter colors of existing pic-
tures by using the software that shipped with your camera, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast.
The old-fashioned fluorescent lights found in
most public restrooms, for example, put out a
bluish-greenish light, which is why our reflec-
tions in the mirrors in those restrooms always
look so sickly. And if you think that your
beloved looks especially attractive by candle-
light, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight
casts a warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering
to the skin.
Science-y types measure the color of light, offi-
cially known as color temperature, on the Kelvin
scale, which is named after its creator. You can
see the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16.

Figure 6-16: Each light source
emits a specific color.

When photographers talk about “warm light” and “cool light,” though, they
aren’t referring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least not in the
way we usually think of temperatures, with a higher number meaning hotter.
Instead, the terms describe the visual appearance of the light. Warm light,
produced by candles and incandescent lights, falls in the red-yellow spec-
trum you see at the bottom of the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16; cool light, in the
blue-green spectrum, appears at the top of the scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluctuating colors of light because
our eyes automatically compensate for them. Except in very extreme lighting
conditions, a white tablecloth appears white to us no matter whether we
view it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through a
feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts
colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s automatic white bal-
ance setting, which carries the label AWB, tackles this process remarkably
well in most situations, which means that you can usually ignore it and con-
centrate on other aspects of your picture. But if your scene is lit by two or
more light sources that cast different colors, the white balance sensor can
get confused, producing an unwanted color cast like the one you see in the
left image in Figure 6-17.
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty
strong daylight to filter through. In automatic white balance mode, the
camera reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied
too much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just
switched the white balance mode from AWB to the Tungsten Light setting.
The right image in Figure 6-17 shows the corrected colors.
Unfortunately, you can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection if
you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes. So if you spy color prob-
lems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP mode. (Chapter 5 details all five exposure modes).

Figure 6-17: Multiple light sources resulted in a yellow color cast in Auto white balance mode
(left); switching to the Tungsten Light setting solved the problem (right).
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance 
correction; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance 
features.
Changing the white balance setting
To switch from automatic to manual white balancing, follow these steps:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
You can tweak white balance only in these advanced exposure modes.
2. Press the WB button.
You see the White Balance screen, shown on the left in Figure 6-18.
3. Press the right or left cross key to highlight the setting you want 
to use.

As you scroll through the list of options, the name of the selected setting
appears above the little icon. For some settings, the camera also dis-
plays the approximate Kelvin temperature of the light source that the
setting matches, as shown in the figure. (Refer to Figure 6-16 for a look at
the Kelvin scale.)
Figure 6-18: Press the WB button to access white balance options.
If the scene is lit by several light sources, choose the setting that corre-
sponds to the strongest source. The Tungsten Light setting is usually
best for regular incandescent household bulbs, by the way. And with the
Custom option, you can define your own white balance setting; see the
next section for details.
4. Press Set to lock in your choice.
You can confirm the current white balance setting by displaying the Camera
Settings screen. The symbol representing the setting appears in the position
labeled in the right image in Figure 6-18. (You also can display the symbol
during Live View shooting; see Chapter 4 to find out how.) Table 6-1 offers a
reminder of what setting each symbol represents.
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, M, and
A-DEP exposure modes until you change it again. So you may want to get in
the habit of resetting the option to AWB (automatic white balance) after you
finish shooting whatever subject it was that caused you to switch to manual
white balance mode.

Creating a custom white balance setting
If none of the preset white balance options produces the right amount of
color correction, you can create your own custom setting. To use this tech-
nique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral gray or absolute
white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-but-not perfect
white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this purpose in many
camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for
your photo. Then take these steps:
1. Set the camera to the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
You can’t create a custom setting in any of the fully automatic modes.
2. Set the camera to manual focusing and then focus on your reference
card.

Chapter 1 has details on manual focusing if you need help.
3. Frame the shot so that your reference card fills the center area of the
viewfinder.
In other words, make sure that at least the center autofocus point and
the six surrounding points fall over the reference card.
4. Make sure that the exposure settings are correct.
Just press the shutter button halfway to check exposure. In M mode,
make sure that the exposure indicator is at the midway point of the
exposure meter. In other modes, a blinking aperture or shutter speed
value indicates an exposure problem. If necessary, adjust ISO, aperture,
or shutter speed to fix the problem; Chapter 5 explains how.
5. Take the picture of your reference card.
The camera will use this picture to establish your custom white balance
setting.
6. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Custom WB, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19: You can create a custom white balance setting through Shooting Menu 2. 
7. Press Set.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-19. The image you
just captured should appear in the display. (The figure shows the picture
I took of a gray reference card.) If not, press the right or left cross key to
scroll to the image.

10. Press Set one more time to finalize the deal and return to Shooting
Menu 2.
Your custom white balance setting remains stored until the next time you
work your way through these steps. So anytime you’re shooting in the same
lighting conditions and want to apply the same white balance correction, just
press the WB button to access the white balance settings and then select the
Custom option.
Fine-tuning white balance settings
As yet another alternative for manipulating colors, your Rebel XSi/450D
enables you to tweak white balancing in a way that shifts all colors toward a
particular part of the color spectrum. The end result is similar to applying a
traditional color filter to your lens.
To access this option, called White Balance Correction, take these steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
You can take advantage of White Balance Correction only in these
modes.
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB Shift/Bkt, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-21.

Figure 6-21: White Balance Correction offers one more way to control colors.
3. Press Set to display the screen you see on the right in Figure 6-21.
The screen contains a grid that is oriented around two main color pairs:
green and magenta, represented by the G and M labels, and blue and
amber, represented by B and A. The little white square indicates the cur-
rent amount of white balance correction, or shift. When the square is
dead center in the grid, as in the figure, no shift is applied.
4. Use the cross keys to move the
square marker in the direction
of the shift you want to achieve.
As you do, the Shift area of the
display tells the amount of color
bias that you’ve selected. For
example, in Figure 6-22, I shifted
three levels toward amber and
one toward magenta.
If you’re familiar with traditional
lens filters, you may know that
the density of a filter, which
determines the degree of color
correction it provides, is mea-
sured in mireds (pronounced 
my-redds). The white balance grid
is designed around this system: Moving the marker one level is the
equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds.
5. Press Set to apply the change and return to the menu.
After you apply white balance correction, a little plus or minus sign
appears next to the white balance symbol in the Camera Settings dis-
play, as shown on the left in Figure 6-23. That’s your reminder that white
balance shift is being applied. The same symbol appears in the
viewfinder, right next to the ISO value.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You can see the exact shift values in Shooting Menu 2, as shown on the
right in Figure 6-23, and also in the Camera Function Settings display.
(Remember, to activate that display, first display any menu and then
press the DISP button. Chapter 1 provides more details.)
Figure 6-23: The +/- symbol lets you know that white balance shift is being applied.
Your adjustment remains in force for all the advanced exposure modes
until you change it. And the correction is applied no matter what white
balance setting you choose. So make it a point to check the monitor or
viewfinder before your next shoot — otherwise, you may forget to adjust
the white balance for the current light.
6. To cancel white balance correction, repeat Steps 1–3, set the marker
back to the center of the grid, and press Set.
Use the cross keys to move the marker back to the center of the grid. 
Be sure that values in the Shift area of the display are both set to 0. In
other words, your screen should look like what you see on the right in
Figure 6-21.
As an alternative, you can press the DISP button after you get to the grid
display. However, doing so also cancels white balance bracketing, a fea-
ture explained in the next section. After you press DISP, be sure to press
Set to lock in your decision. 
Many film-photography enthusiasts place colored filters on their lenses to
either warm or cool their images. Portrait photographers, for example, often
add a warming filter to give skin tones a healthy, golden glow. You can mimic
the effects of such filters by simply fine-tuning your camera’s white balance
settings as just described. Experiment with shifting the white balance a tad
toward amber and magenta for a warming effect or toward blue and green for
a cooling effect.

Bracketing shots with white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic exposure bracketing,
which enables you to easily record the same image at three different expo-
sure settings. Similarly, you can take advantage of automatic white balance
bracketing. With this feature, the camera records the same image three times,
using a slightly different white balance setting for each.
This feature is especially helpful when you’re shooting in varying light
sources — for example, a mix of fluorescent light, daylight, and flash.
Bracketing the shots ups the odds that the color renditions of at least one of
the shots will be to your liking.
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 You can’t use white balance bracketing if you set the camera’s Quality
setting to either Raw or Raw+Large/Fine. And frankly, there isn’t any
need to do so in Raw mode because you can precisely tune colors when
you process the Raw files. Chapter 8 has details on Raw processing.
 White Balance Bracketing is also disabled if you turn on High ISO Speed
Noise Reduction. You can read about that feature, accessed through
Custom Function 4, in Chapter 5.
 Because the camera records three images, white balance bracketing
reduces the maximum capture speed that is possible when you use the
Continuous shooting mode. See Chapter 2 for more about Continuous
mode. Of course, recording three images instead of one also eats up
more space on your memory card.
 The white balance bracketing feature is designed around the same grid
used for white balance correction, explained in the preceding section. 
As a reminder, the grid is based on two color pairs: green/magenta and
blue/amber.
 When white balance bracketing is enabled, the camera always records
the first of the three bracketed shots using a neutral white balance 
setting — or, at least, what it considers to be neutral, given its own mea-
surement of the light. The second and third shots are then recorded
using the specified shift along either the green/magenta or blue/amber
axis of the color grid.
If all that is as clear as mud, just take a look at Figure 6-24 for an example. 
I captured these images using a single tungsten studio light and the candle
light itself. I set up white balance bracketing to work along the blue/amber
color axis. So the camera recorded the first image at neutral, the second with
a slightly blue color bias, and the third, with an amber bias.
187
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-24: I captured one neutral image, one with a blue bias, and one with an amber bias.
To enable white balance bracketing, take these steps:
1. Make sure the Quality option is
not set to record Raw images.
You find this setting on Shooting
Menu 1. If you select Raw (or
Raw+Large/Fine), the camera
simply records each image the
same way. You then can adjust
colors in your Raw processor.
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and
highlight WB/Shift Bkt.
3. Press Set to display the grid
shown in Figure 6-25.
The screen is the same one you
see when you use the White Balance Correction feature, explained in the
preceding section.
4. Rotate the Main dial to set the amount and direction of the bracketing
shift.
Neutral
+3 Blue bias
+3 Amber bias
Figure 6-25: I used these settings to capture
the bracketed candle images.

Rotate the Main dial as follows to specify whether you want the bracket-
ing to be applied across the horizontal axis (blue to amber) or the verti-
cal axis (green to magenta).
• Blue to amber bracketing: Rotate the dial right.
• Green to magenta bracketing: Rotate the dial left. 
As you rotate the dial, three markers appear on the grid, indicating the
amount of shift that will be applied to your trio of bracketed images. You
can apply a maximum shift of plus or minus three levels of adjustment.
The BKT area of the screen also indicates the shift; for example, in
Figure 6-25, the display shows a bracketing amount of plus and minus
three levels on the blue/amber axis. I used the settings shown in Figure
6-25 to record the example images you see in Figure 6-24. As you can see,
even at the maximum shift (+/– 3), the difference to the colors is subtle.
If you want to get really fancy, you can combine White Balance
Bracketing with White Balance Shift. To set the amount of white balance
shift, press the cross keys to move the square markers around the grid.
Then use the Main dial to adjust the bracketing setting. (See the preced-
ing section for details about white balance shift.)
5. Press Set to apply your changes and return to the menu.
The bracketing symbol shown in
Figure 6-26 appears in the Camera
Settings display. The Camera
Function Settings display, which
you bring up by pressing DISP
when any menu is visible, also
reports the current bracketing
setting.
Your bracketing setting remains in
effect until you turn the camera off.
You can also cancel bracketing by
revisiting the grid screen shown in
Figure 6-25 and either rotating the
Main dial until you see only a single
grid marker or pressing the DISP
button. Either way, press Set to offi-
cially turn off bracketing.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
Normally, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the
digital imaging color world.) This color mode was created to help ensure
color consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor
and printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these
devices can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative,
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-27 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
Figure 6-27: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
sRGB spectrum.
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB

Some colors in the Adobe RGB spectrum cannot be reproduced in print. Still,
I usually shoot in Adobe RGB mode because I see no reason to limit myself to
a smaller spectrum from the get-go.
If you want to capture images in Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit Shooting
Menu 2 and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in Fig-
ure 6-28. Press Set to display the screen shown on the right in the figure.
Press the up or down cross key to highlight Adobe RGB and press Set again.
Remember that this color mode choice applies only when you shoot in the
advanced exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. In all other modes, the
camera automatically selects sRGB as the color space.
Figure 6-28: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as 
in _MG_0627.jpg. Pictures captured in the sRGB color space start with 
the letter I, as in IMG_0627.jpg.
Exploring Picture Styles
In addition to all the focus and color features already covered in this chapter,
your Rebel XSi/450D offers Picture Styles. Through Picture Styles, you can 
further tweak color, saturation, contrast, and image sharpening.
191
Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color

192
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to a
software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of
slightly sharper focus. I explain sharpening fully in Chapter 10, but the impor-
tant thing to note for now is that sharpening cannot remedy poor focus, but
instead produces a subtle tweak to this aspect of your pictures.
In fact, many of the adjustments that Picture Styles apply are pretty subtle, at
least to my eye. The impact of any of these settings varies depending on your
subject, but on the whole, if you want to make large-scale changes to color,
contrast, or sharpening, you’re probably going to need to use your computer
and photo editing software.
Again, though, your mileage may vary, as they say, as may your opinion of
what constitutes the optimum color and sharpening characteristics. So I
leave it to you to do your own testing and decide for yourself which of the
Picture Style settings you prefer for your photographs. (Inspect your test
shots on your computer monitor, where the differences produced by the vari-
ous Picture Style settings are easier to spot than on the camera monitor or on
these pages.)
The next section introduces you to your Picture Style options. Later sections
explain how to change the Picture Style setting, customize the six prefab
styles, and define your very own, custom styles.
Assessing the Picture Styles
When you set the Mode dial to Full Auto or any of the other fully automatic
exposure modes, the camera selects a Picture Style for you. In P, Tv, Av, M,
and A-DEP modes, however, you can specify which of the Picture Styles you
want to use. Here’s a quick description of the six styles:
 Standard: The default setting, this option captures the image using the
characteristics that Canon offers as suitable for the majority of subjects. 
 Portrait: This mode reduces sharpening slightly from the amount that’s
applied in Standard mode, with the goal of keeping skin texture soft.
Color saturation, on the other hand, is slightly increased. 
The Canon manual recommends this setting for portraits of women and
children — presuming, I guess, that men prefer not to be rendered with

slightly soft skin. But I suggest that it’s appropriate for portraits regard-
less of gender or age. 
If you shoot in the Portrait exposure mode, the camera automatically
applies this Picture Style for you.
 Landscape: In a nod to traditions of landscape photography, this Picture
Style emphasizes greens and blues and amps up color saturation and
sharpness, resulting in bolder images.
The camera automatically applies this Picture Style if you set the Mode
dial to the Landscape exposure mode.
 Neutral: This setting reduces saturation and contrast slightly compared
to how the camera renders images when the Standard option is selected. 
 Faithful: The Faithful style is designed to render colors as closely as
possible to how your eye perceives them.
 Monochrome: This setting produces, er, black-and-white photos. Only in
the digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true black-
and-white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
If you set the Quality option on Shooting Menu 1 to Raw (or Raw +
Large/Fine), the camera displays your image on the monitor in black and
white during playback. But during the Raw converter process, you can
either choose to go with your grayscale version or view and save a full-
color version. Or, even better, you can process and save the image once
as a grayscale photo and again as a color image.
If you don’t capture the image in the Raw format, you can’t access the
original image colors later. 
 User Defined 1, 2, and 3: These options enable you to create and save
three of your own Picture Styles. I cover this feature in the last section of
the chapter.
Figure 6-29 shows you how the camera rendered the same scene in each of
the six preset Picture Styles. As you can see, Landscape has the most notice-
able impact. To my taste, in fact, Landscape colors are a little over the top,
but that’s strictly a personal preference.
If you don’t like any of the Picture Styles, you can use the options discussed
in later sections to tweak them.

Setting the Picture Style
To select a Picture Style quickly, press the down cross key, which bears the
symbol you see in Figure 6-30. Pressing the button displays the screen you
see on the monitor in the figure.
Neutral
Faithful
Monochrome
Standard
Portrait
Landscape

Figure 6-30: Press the down cross key to quickly change the Picture Style.
Here’s what you need to know about this cryptic-looking screen:
 Picture Style icons: The two
columns of symbols on the right
represent the Picture Styles, as
labeled in Figure 6-30. The six
prefab styles are marked with an
initial (S for Standard, P for
Portrait, and so on). The 1, 2, and
3 icons represent the three User
Defined custom styles that you
can create. (Notice that the icons
representing the Picture Styles
bear the same symbol as the down
cross key.)
 Adjustment setting icons: On the
left side of the screen, you see the
name of the currently selected style
plus four more symbols, each
accompanied by a number. I labeled
these four symbols “Adjustment
settings” in Figure 6-30; you can get
a close-up view in Figure 6-31. The
icons represent the four character-
istics that the styles affect: sharp-
ness, contrast, saturation, and
color tone.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Note that the figures show you the symbols as they appear for all styles
but the Monochrome option; if you select Monochrome, the saturation
and color tone options are replaced by two other options, filter effect
and toning effect.
 Adjustment values: As for the numbers next to the symbols, they work a
little differently than you may expect. Sharpness values range from 0 to
7; the higher the value, the more sharpening is applied. At 0, no sharpen-
ing is applied.
The other values, however, all initially appear as 0, which in this case
represents a middle-of-the-road contrast, saturation, and color tone
values. If you customize the style, the number indicates the level of
adjustment that you applied to the style. For example, if you customize
the style so that it applies three levels more saturation than normal, you
see a 3 next to the saturation icon. If you go the other direction, tweak-
ing the style so that it applies three levels less saturation than normal,
you see a –3 instead.
See the upcoming section “Customizing Picture Styles” for a little more
detail about the four picture characteristics.
To select a style, press the up or
down cross key to highlight that
style’s icon. Press Set to lock in your
style choice. As soon as you do, the
Camera Settings display appears
automatically, and you can see the
icon for your selected Picture Style in
the position labeled in Figure 6-32.
You can also change the Picture Style
through Shooting Menu 2, shown on
the left in Figure 6-33. Highlight the
Picture Styles option and press Set to
display the screenful of options you
see on the right in the figure. (You
can see only the six prefab Picture
Style settings on the first screen;
scroll down using the cross keys 
to view the User Defined styles.) 
The symbols at the top of the Picture Style screen (right image in Figure 6-33)
are the same ones shown in Figure 6-30. And the numbers next to each style
show you the amount of adjustment for each of the four picture characteristics.
However you set the Picture Style, remember that you must do so before you
switch to Live View shooting, if you choose to turn on that feature. Once you
jump to Live View mode, you can’t change the Picture Style. See Chapter 4 for
an introduction to Live View shooting.

Figure 6-32: The icons in the Camera Settings
display match those on the Picture Styles
screen (shown in Figure 6-30).

Figure 6-33: You also can access Picture Style options via Shooting Menu 2.
Customizing Picture Styles
You can customize the results that you get from the prefab Picture Styles. For
the Standard, Landscape, Portrait, Neutral, and Faithful styles, you can adjust
sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone.
I’m guessing that the first three effects — sharpness, contrast, and saturation —
are self-explanatory. But the color tone option may not be so obvious. This
option, which is designed to help you tweak skin colors, enables you to make
your colors either a little more red or a little more yellow.
For the Monochrome Picture Style, saturation and color tone are irrelevant,
so they are replaced by two other options, Filter and Toning Effect. The Filter
effect options mimic color filters sometimes used by photographers shooting
black-and-white film. The color of the filter determines which colors in the
original scene become prominent in the black-and-white image. The Toning
Effect options enable you to apply a sepia, blue, purple, or green tint to your
monochrome image.
To dig into Picture Style customizing, take these steps:
1. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Picture Style, as shown on the
left in Figure 6-33.
2. Press Set.
Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-33.
3. Press the up or down cross key to highlight the Picture Style you want
to adjust.

Monochrome style, you see
Filter and Toning Effect options
instead of Saturation and Color
Tone.
5. Highlight the characteristic
that you want to tweak and
press Set.
The little scale next to the selec-
tion option becomes active.
6. Press the right or left cross key
to adjust the setting.
As soon as you adjust the setting, you see two markers: The gray one
shows you the default setting; the white one, your customized setting, 
as labeled in Figure 6-34.
For contrast, saturation, and sharpness, move the little marker on the
scale to the right to increase the effect. For color tone, move the slider
toward the minus sign to make colors less yellow and more red; move
the slider toward the plus sign to make colors less red and more yellow.
When you adjust the Filter and Toning Effect options for the
Monochrome style, the adjustment scale and slider are replaced by a
simple list of options; just highlight the one you want to use.
7. Press Set to lock in your adjustment.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 to adjust the other settings as desired.
9. Press the Menu button to return to the main Picture Styles screen.
10. Press Set to return to Shooting Menu 2.
Note that any user-adjusted setting appears highlighted in blue on the
Picture Style submenu.
If you later want to return to the default settings for the Picture Style, just
repeat Steps 1 through 4 and then highlight Default Set (at the bottom of the
screen shown in Figure 6-34) and press Set.
Unfortunately, you can’t preview how your adjustments will affect your image
because the Picture Style attributes are applied to the photo after you shoot it,
during the time the image is recorded to your memory card. So I’d like to offer
another alternative: If you shoot in the Raw format, you don’t have to worry
about in-camera adjustments to Picture Styles — or even selecting a Picture

Style, for that matter — because you can apply the style when you process
your Raw images. Just follow the directions laid out in Chapter 8 to use the
Raw converter provided in ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser
(Mac). On the Image Quality Adjustment panel, you can select a Picture Style
and then make the same adjustments to the style as you can in the camera.
The Raw converter method of applying Picture Styles is perhaps most benefi-
cial for creating monochrome images — unless you’re schooled in black-and-
white photography, it can be difficult to predict which of the Monochrome
settings will best translate your colors into a grayscale image.
At the very least, experimenting with Picture Styles in the Raw converter
should help you know what adjustments you may want to make to the actual
camera settings. And for creating monochrome images, using the Raw con-
verter tools enables you to experiment with all the different Filter and Toning
Effects options to find the one you like best.
Creating your own Picture Style
The User Defined options on the Picture Style menu enable you to create 
and store up to three of your very own Picture Styles. So if you hit upon a
combination of customized settings that you really like for a particular type
of subject — snow scenes, for example, or pictures of your pooch — you can
easily reuse those settings.
Follow these steps to create your custom Picture Style:
1. Display Shooting Menu 2, highlight Picture Style, and press Set.
You see the normal list of Picture Styles.
2. Press the down cross key to scroll the display until the User Defined
options come into view.
3. Highlight one of the User Defined options, as shown on the left in

trols affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter
pulls all that information together to help you set up your camera for specific
types of photography.
The first few pages offer a quick summary of critical picture-
taking settings that should serve you well no matter what
your subject. Following that, I offer my advice on which
settings to use for portraits, action shots, landscapes,
and close-ups. To wrap things up, the end of the chap-
ter includes some miscellaneous tips for dealing with
special shooting situations and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-

to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own,
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which settings
you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and shutter
speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But for a few
basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every shooting sce-
nario. Table 7-1 lists these options as well as how you access them. Figure 7-1
offers a reminder of where to find the buttons that are referenced in the table.
(The ISO button isn’t fully visible in this shot; the button’s on top of the
camera, right behind the Main dial).
Figure 7-1: You can access several critical settings with a press of a single button.
Other chapters detail all these settings, but here’s a quick reminder of how
each one affects your image:

and resolution of picture file the camera creates. For best quality and
the largest possible print size, choose Large/Fine or Raw (CR2). Keep in

mind that you must process Raw files in a raw converter; Chapter 8
explains that issue. For everyday images that you don’t plan to print
large or crop, Medium/Fine is also a good choice and creates smaller
files than the other two settings.
 White Balance: White balance compensates for the color casts pro-
duced by different light sources. Auto white balance (AWB) mode usu-
ally does the trick unless you’re dealing with multiple light sources; in
that case, you may need to switch to manual white balance control.
Chapter 6 tells you how. You can control this setting only in the
advanced exposure modes.
 ISO: This setting determines the light sensitivity of the camera’s image
sensor. Increasing the ISO value can create noise defects, so stick with
the lowest setting possible given the available light. You can’t select ISO
in the fully automatic exposure modes; the camera sets the value
between 100 and 800 for you. Chapter 5 details ISO.
 AF (autofocus) mode: Chapter 6 details this option, which affects the
autofocus system. In the AI Focus mode, the camera chooses the best
autofocus mode based on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still or

moving subject. (The AI stands for artificial intelligence.) In most cases,
this setting works well. You can control this option only in P, Tv, Av, and
M exposure modes.
 Drive mode: This setting enables you to shift from Single mode, in
which you record one image each time you press the shutter button, to
Continuous mode, in which the camera continues to capture images as
long as you hold down the shutter button. 
Single mode is the best choice in most cases, but Continuous can come 
in handy for action shots, as covered later in this chapter. But you can
select Continuous or Single only in the advanced exposure modes. In 
the fully automatic modes, the camera chooses for you. Note that your
camera also offers three other settings that permit self-timer and remote-
control shooting; see Chapter 2 for details on all the Drive modes.
 AF Point Selection: This control enables you to choose from two auto-
focusing setups when you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In
Automatic AF Point Selection mode, all nine of the camera’s autofocus
points are active, and the camera typically locks focus on the point that
covers the nearest object or person. In Manual AF Point Selection mode,
you can specify which of the nine autofocus points you want the camera to
use when establishing focus. The camera always uses the automatic option
when you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes or A-DEP mode.
 Metering mode: This option determines what part of the frame the
camera analyzes when calculating exposure. Evaluative metering takes
the whole frame into account, which produces good results for most
scenes. See Chapter 5 for the scoop on the other options, Partial, Spot,
and Center-Weighted Average metering, which are selectable only when
you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. All fully automatic modes
use Evaluative metering. 
 Picture Style: When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you
can manipulate color, sharpness, and contrast by selecting from one of
six preset Picture Style settings or by defining your own custom style. In
the fully automatic modes, the camera selects the Picture Style for you
based on which mode you’re using. For example, in Portrait exposure
mode, the camera selects the Portrait Picture Style setting. See Chapter
6 for a review of all the Picture Style controls.
 Live View: Enabling Live View shooting, in which you use the monitor as
a viewfinder, results in the loss of control over some important photog-
raphy options, including Metering mode, Drive mode, AF mode, and
Flash Exposure Lock (FE Lock). For this reason, along with some other
caveats that you can explore at the end of Chapter 4, I suggest that you
disable Live View for most shots. The exception is the scenario for
which Live View is really intended: still-life photography in which you
can use a tripod or otherwise stabilize the camera. In any case, you can
use Live View only in the advanced exposure modes.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed that
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically 
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the
way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for
every so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.
Shooting still portraits
By “still portrait,” I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who
aren’t keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children,
pets, and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and
use the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus, as shown in the examples in this section. This artistic
choice emphasizes the subject and helps diminish the impact of any distract-
ing background objects in cases where you can’t control the setting. The fol-
lowing steps show you how to achieve this look: 
1. Set the Mode dial to Av (aperture-priority auto exposure) and then
select the lowest f-stop value possible.
As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop number opens the aperture, which
shortens depth of field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-
stop value is the first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-
stop range available to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind
that the farther your subject is from the background, the more back-
ground blurring you can achieve.
I recommend aperture-priority autoexposure when depth of field is a pri-
mary concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the
camera to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image.
Just rotate the Main dial to select your desired f-stop. But if you aren’t
comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait mode also
results in a more open aperture, although the exact f-stop setting is out
of your control. Chapter 2 details Portrait mode.
Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current aperture and
shutter speed both in the Camera Settings display, as shown on the left
in Figure 7-2, and in the viewfinder display, as shown on the right.
205
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

206
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 7-2: You can view exposure settings in the Camera Settings display or viewfinder.
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both.
As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how
people look when you view them through a security peephole in a door.
3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
Shooting by available light rather than flash produces softer illumination
and avoids the problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-free,
turn on room lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a
sunny window.
In the Av exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed
disables the flash. In Portrait mode, unfortunately, you can’t disable the
flash if the camera thinks more light is needed. Your only option is to
change the exposure mode to No Flash, in which case the camera may
or may not choose an aperture setting that throws the background into
soft focus.
If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to
get better results.

4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash.
Even in bright daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’
faces, as discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated here in Figure 7-3.
Unfortunately, the camera doesn’t let you use flash in Portrait mode if
the light is very bright. In the Av exposure mode, just press the Flash
button on the side of the camera to enable the flash.
Remember that in dim lighting, the camera may select a shutter speed
as slow as 1/30 second when you enable flash in Av mode, so keep an
eye on that value and use a tripod if necessary to avoid blurring from
camera shake. On the flip side of the coin, the fastest shutter speed you
can use with flash is 1/200 second, and in extremely bright conditions,
that may be too slow to avoid overexposing the image. If necessary,
move your subject into the shade.
5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to engage exposure meter-
ing and, in autofocus mode, to lock in focus.
Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. (In the
viewfinder, active autofocus points turn red.) For best results, try to set
focus on your subject’s eyes.
Chapter 6 explains more about using autofocus, but if you have trouble,
simply set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing
ring to set focus.
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 Before pressing the shutter button, do a quick background check.
Scan the entire frame looking for intrusive objects that may distract the
eye from the subject. If necessary, reposition the subject against a more
flattering backdrop if possible. Inside, a softly textured wall works well;
outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide nice backdrops as long as they
aren’t so ornate or colorful that they diminish the subject (for example,
a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of
frame sizes. Your camera produces images that have an aspect ratio of
3:2. That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but
will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 
8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
 Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to automatic (AWB),
as I recommend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm
colors to compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also
lit by room lights or daylight, the result may be colors that are slightly
warmer than neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in por-
traits, giving the skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the
result or want even more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-
tune white balance. Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, Tv,
Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results.
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning,
however.)
• Try setting the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode for nighttime and
indoor portraits. Warn your subject to expect both a light coming
from the Red-Eye Reduction lamp, which constricts pupils, and the
actual flash. See Chapter 2 for details about using this flash mode,
which you enable through Shooting Menu 1.
• For nighttime pictures, try Night Portrait mode. In this autoexposure
mode, the camera automatically selects a slower shutter speed
than normal. This enables the camera to soak up more ambient
light, producing a brighter background and reducing the flash
power that’s needed to light the subject. A slow shutter, however,
means that you need to use a tripod to avoid camera shake, which
can blur the photo. You also need to warn your subjects to remain
very still during the exposure.

• Soften the flash light by attaching a diffuser to the flash head. This
inexpensive tool both softens and spreads the light. You can see a
picture of one type of diffuser in Chapter 5. You may need to bump
up exposure slightly to compensate for the light filtering that
occurs; the camera doesn’t know that you attached the diffuser
and so doesn’t adjust the exposure on its own. In the P, Tv, Av, or
A-DEP autoexposure modes, you can use exposure compensation
to adjust the image brightness or, as an alternative, you can
increase the flash power slightly. Again, Chapter 5 has details on
these exposure features.
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. 
An external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two por-
traits in Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the 
built-in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject 
and harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on 
the right, I used the Canon Speedlite 580EX II and bounced the 
light off the ceiling.
Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash and
moved the subject farther from the background (right).

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther 
from the background. I took this extra step for the right image in
Figure 7-4. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing 
but also softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short
depth of field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible,
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
• Study the flash information in Chapter 5, and practice before you
need to take important portraits. How the camera calculates the
aperture, shutter speed, and flash power needed to expose your
subject and background varies depending on the exposure mode
you use. So to fully understand how to get the flash results you
want, it pays to experiment with each of the advanced exposure
modes, all covered in Chapter 5.
For the maximum control over aperture, shutter speed, and flash
power, try working in Manual exposure mode and make friends
with the Flash Compensation and FE Lock (flash exposure lock)
features.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving
subject, whether it’s a spinning Ferris wheel, a butterfly flitting from flower to
flower, or in the case of Figures 7-5 and 7-6, a hockey-playing teen. In the first
image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow to catch the subject
without blur. For this subject, who was moving at a fairly rapid speed, I
needed to bump the shutter speed all the way up to 1/1000 second to freeze
the action cleanly, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, I use the tech-
niques in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
1. Set the Mode dial to Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure).
In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced autoexposure mode,
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But
be aware that you have no control over any other aspects of your pic-
ture (such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.

Figure 7-5: A too-slow shutter speed (1/125 second) causes the skater to appear blurry.
Figure 7-6: Raising the shutter speed to 1/1000 second “froze” the action.
211
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

212
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
2. Rotate the Main dial to select the shutter speed.
In the Camera Settings display, the option that appears in purple, with
the little arrow pointers at each side, is the one that you can adjust with
the Main dial. In Tv mode, the shutter speed is the active option, as
shown in Figure 7-7. After you select the shutter speed, the camera
selects the aperture (f-stop) necessary to produce a good exposure.
What shutter speed you need depends on how fast your subject is
moving, so some experimentation is needed. But generally speaking,
1/500 second should be plenty for all but the fastest subjects — speeding
hockey players like my subject, race cars, boats, and so on. For slower
subjects, you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.
If the aperture value blinks after
you set the shutter speed, the
camera can’t select an f-stop that
will properly expose the photo at
that shutter speed. See Chapter 5
for more details about how the
camera notifies you of potential
exposure problems.
3. Raise the ISO setting or add
flash to produce a brighter
exposure if needed.
In dim lighting, you may not be
able to get a good exposure at
your chosen shutter speed with-
out taking this step. Raising the
ISO does increase the possibility
of noise, but a noisy shot is
better than a blurry shot. The
current ISO setting appears just below the f-stop value in the Camera
Settings display, as shown in Figure 7-7.
Note that in Sports mode, the camera automatically overrides your ISO
setting if it deems necessary, but it can go only as high as ISO 800. If you
stick with Tv mode and raise the ISO above 400, you may want to enable
High ISO Speed Noise Reduction to help alleviate noise. However, doing
so can slow down the speed at which you can capture images, so it’s a
bit of a tradeoff. For more on all of these ISO issues, see Chapter 5.
Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And
third, remember that the fastest possible shutter speed when you
enable flash is 1/200 second, which may not be fast enough to capture a
quickly moving subject without blur. For more on this issue, check out
Chapter 5.
Drive mode
Shutter speed
AF mode
Figure 7-7: Changing the Drive mode to
Continuous allows rapid-fire shooting.

If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode, though;
it doesn’t permit you to use flash.
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Drive mode to Continuous.
In this mode, you can take as many as three pictures per second. The
camera continues to record images as long as the shutter button is
pressed. You can switch the Drive mode by pressing the left cross key;
the icon representing the current mode appears in the Camera Settings
display, as labeled in Figure 7-7.
If you do enable the flash, the pace at which the camera can record
images slows because the flash needs time to recycle between shots.
Chapter 2 explains more about all the Drive mode options.
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
You then eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in autofocus
mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you need help.
If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
• Set the AF Point Selection mode to Automatic. Press the button
shown in the margin here to adjust this setting.
• Set the AF (autofocus) mode to AI Servo (continuous-servo 
autofocus). Press the right cross key to access this setting.
Chapter 6 details these autofocus options.
6. Turn off automatic image review to speed up the camera even more.
You do this via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1. Turning the
option off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover
between shots.
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
You can always crop the photo later to a tighter composition. (I did so
for my example images, which originally contained quite a bit more
background than you see in the book.) Chapter 10 shows you how to
crop pictures.
8. Lock in autofocus (if used) in advance.
Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the action occurs,
just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your image-capture
time is faster because the camera has already done the work of estab-
lishing focus. Remember that in AI Servo mode, you must keep the sub-
ject under the active autofocus point (or points) in order for the camera
to maintain focus. Again, Chapter 6 details this feature.
213
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together

214
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast as
you can.
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to
help you photograph a landscape
the way you see it:
 Shoot in aperture-priority
autoexposure mode (Av) so
that you can control depth of
field. If you want extreme depth
of field, so that both near and
distant objects are sharply
focused, as in Figure 7-8, select
a high f-stop value. I used an
aperture of f/16 for this shot.
You can also use the Landscape
autoexposure mode to achieve a
large depth of field. In this mode,
the camera automatically selects
a high f-stop number, but you
have no control over the exact
value (or any other picture-
taking settings.) Of course, if 
the light is dim, the camera may
be forced to open the aperture,
reducing depth of field, to prop-
erly expose the image. (Don’t
confuse Landscape autoexpo-
sure mode with the Landscape
Picture Style; the Landscape
mode you want is the one you select from the Mode dial on top of the
camera. See Chapter 6 for more details about Picture Styles.)
Figure 7-8: Use a high f-stop value (or
Landscape mode) to keep foreground and
background sharply focused.

 If the exposure requires a
slow shutter, use a tripod
to avoid blurring. The
downside to a high f-stop is
that you need a slower
shutter speed to produce a
good exposure. If the shut-
ter speed drops below what
you can comfortably hand-
hold — for me, that’s about
1/50 second — use a tripod
to avoid picture-blurring
camera shake. No tripod
handy? Look for any solid
surface on which you can
steady the camera. You 
can always increase the 
ISO setting to increase light
sensitivity, which in turn
allows a faster shutter
speed, too, but that option
brings with it the chances
of increased image noise.
See Chapter 5 for details.
Also see Chapter 1 for
details about image stabi-
lization, which can help you
get sharper handheld shots
at slow shutter speeds.
 For dramatic waterfall and fountain shots, consider using a slow shut-
ter to create that “misty” look. The slow shutter blurs the water, giving
it a soft, romantic appearance. Figure 7-9 shows you a close-up of this
effect. Again, use a tripod to ensure that the rest of the scene doesn’t
also blur due to camera shake.
 At sunrise or sunset, base exposure on the sky. The foreground will 
be dark, but you can usually brighten it in a photo editor if needed. If
you base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the sky will
become so bright that all the color will be washed out — a problem you
usually can’t fix after the fact.
This tip doesn’t apply, of course, if your sunrise or sunset is merely 
serving as a gorgeous backdrop for a portrait. In that case, you should
enable your flash and expose for the subject. 
In the advanced exposure modes, you also can experiment with enabling
the Highlight Tone Priority option, which you do via Custom Function 5,
on Setup Menu 3. This feature can help you retain some additional
shadow detail without blowing out highlights. Chapter 5 offers more
information.
215
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-9: For misty waterfalls, use a slow shutter
speed (and tripod).

216
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in
Figure 7-10, taken by my friend Jonathan Conrad. Shutter speed for this
image was 8 seconds.
Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try
setting the speed to Bulb. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode,
this option records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter
button. So just take a series of images, holding the button down for dif-
ferent lengths of time for each shot. In Bulb mode, you also can exceed
the minimum (slowest) shutter speed of 30 seconds. Note that in Bulb
mode, the camera displays the elapsed capture time on the monitor.
Because long exposures can produce image noise, you also may want to
enable the Long Exposure Noise Reduction feature. You access this
option via the Custom Function option on Setup Menu 3; select Custom
Function 3 and change the setting from Off to Auto or On. Chapter 5 dis-
cusses this option in more detail.
 For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently
warmed look.
Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s white balance setting,
using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour light.
 In tricky light, bracket shots. Bracketing simply means to take the same
picture at several different exposures to increase the odds that at least one
of them will capture the scene the way you envision. Bracketing is espe-
cially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such as sunrise and sunset.
Jonathan Conrad
Figure 7-10: A slow shutter also creates neon light trails in city-street scenes.

Your camera offers automatic exposure bracketing when you shoot in
the advanced exposure modes. See Chapter 5 to find out how to take
advantage of this feature.
Also experiment with the Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone
Priority options; capture some images with the features enabled and
then take the same shots with the features turned off. You control both
options through the Custom Functions options on Setup Menu 3; see
Chapter 5 for details.
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, start with the basic capture settings outlined in
Table 7-1. Then try the following additional settings and techniques:
 Check your owner’s manual
to find out the minimum
close-focusing distance of
your lens. How “up close
and personal” you can get to
your subject depends on
your lens, not the camera
body itself. 
 Take control over depth of
field by setting the camera
mode to Av (aperture-
priority autoexposure)
mode. Whether you want a
shallow, medium, or extreme
depth of field depends on
the point of your photo. For
the romantic scene shown in
Figure 7-11, for example, I
wanted to blur the back-
ground to help the subjects
stand out more, so I set the
aperture to f/5.6. But if you
want the viewer to be able 
to clearly see all details
throughout the frame — for
example, if you’re shooting a
product shot for your com-
pany’s sales catalog — you
need to go the other direc-
tion, stopping down the aperture as far as possible.
217
Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-11: Shallow depth of field helps set the
subject apart from the similarly colored
background.

218
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Not ready for the advanced exposure modes yet? Try the Close-Up scene
mode instead. (It’s the one marked with the little flower on your Mode
dial.) In this mode, the camera automatically opens the aperture to
achieve a short depth of field and bases focus on the center of the frame.
 Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image to
show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. (Chapter 5 offers some
examples that illustrate this issue.)
 Use fill flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny
bit of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary
light source. You may need to reduce the flash output slightly, via the
camera’s Flash Compensation control. Chapter 5 offers details about
using flash.
Also keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed possible when you
use flash is 1/200 second. So in very bright light, you may need to use a
high f-stop setting to avoid overexposing the picture. You also can lower
the ISO speed setting, if it’s not already all the way down to ISO 100.
 When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light source.
Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your flash may be
too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If flash is inevitable,
turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the flash power that’s
needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in a pinch as a lighting
source. (Remember that if you have multiple light sources, though, you
may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of
diopters. A true macro lens, which enables you to get really, really close
to your subjects, is an expensive proposition; expect to pay around $200
or more. But if you enjoy capturing the tiny details in life, it’s worth the
investment. 
For a less expensive way to go, you can spend about $40 for a set of
diopters, which are sort of like reading glasses that you screw onto your
existing lens. Diopters come in several strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number indicating a greater magnifying power. I took
this approach to capture the rose in Figure 7-12. The left image shows
you the closest I could get to the subject with my regular lens; to produce
the right image, I attached a +6 diopter. The downfall of diopters, sadly, 
is that they typically produce images that are very soft around the edges,
as in Figure 7-12 — a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.

Figure 7-12: To extend your lens’ close-focus ability, you can add magnifying diopters.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, try
putting your lens flat against the glass. Then switch to manual focusing;
the glass barrier can give the autofocus mechanism fits. Disable your flash
to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, too. I used this technique to
capture the image of the turtle sticking his neck out in Figure 7-13.
 Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority autoex-
posure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate
for the movement of the car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your camera. 
 Shooting in strong backlighting: When the light behind your subject is
very strong and illuminating the subject with flash isn’t an option, you
can expose the image with the subject in mind, in which case the back-
ground may be overexposed. (Turning on Highlight Tone Priority, an
advanced exposure option discussed in Chapter 5, may enable you to
keep some highlights from blowing out, however.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
As an alternative, you can expose for the background, and purposely
underexpose the subject to create a silhouette effect. I opted for this
technique when capturing the image in Figure 7-14, which shows a
young friend standing mesmerized in front of an aquarium. Be sure to
disable your flash when trying to shoot silhouettes.
 Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. If
using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. Switch to
manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point possi-
ble on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, choose a relatively
high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a shutter speed of 1 to 3
seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with different
shutter speeds.
Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur the
image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your camera,
this is a good situation in which to use it.
You also may want to enable your camera’s Long Exposure Noise
Reduction feature because a long exposure also increases the chances of
noise defects. See Chapter 5 for details. (Keep the ISO setting low to fur-
ther dampen noise.)
Figure 7-13: To shoot through glass, place your lens flat against the glass.

Figure 7-14: Experiment with shooting backlit subjects in silhouette.
 Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, you
can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal by
using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $60. A
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a
certain angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must also
reflect off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, a
polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, which may
or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing filter isn’t a
surefire cure-all.
A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest in
a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-15, from
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com),
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200,
depending on size and features.

Picture Files

In this part . . .
You’ve got a memory card full of pictures. 
Now what? Now you turn to the ﬁrst chapter
in this part, which explains how to get those 
pictures out of your camera and onto your com-
puter and, just as important, how to safeguard
them from future digital destruction. After down-
loading your ﬁles, head for Chapter 9, which offers
step-by-step guidance on printing your pictures,
sharing them online, and even viewing them on
your television.

F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping
track of all of those image files is one of the more confusing aspects
of the art form. In fact, students in my classes have more ques-
tions about this subject than just about anything else.
Frankly, writing about the download and organizing
process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!)
The problem is that providing you with detailed
instructions is pretty much impossible because the
steps you need to take vary widely depending on
what software you have installed on your computer
and whether you use the Windows or Macintosh
operating system.
To give you as much help as possible, however, this
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize pictures
using the free software that came in your camera box. After
exploring these discussions, you should be able to adapt the
steps to any other photo program you may prefer.
This chapter also covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files,
including converting pictures taken in the Raw format to a standard image
format. Finally — and perhaps most important — this chapter explains how
to ensure that your digital images stay safe after they leave the camera.

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory
card to your computer:
 Connect the camera directly to the computer. For this option, you need
to dig out the USB cable that came in your camera box. Your computer
must also have a free USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If you aren’t sure
what these gadgets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you a look.
The little three-pronged icon you see on the plug and between the two
ports in Figure 8-1 is the universal symbol for USB. Be sure to check for
this symbol because a different type of slot, called a FireWire slot, looks
very similar to a USB slot, and your USB cable can even seem to fit (sort
of) into a FireWire slot.
 Transfer images using a memory card reader. Many computers now
also have built-in memory card readers. If yours has one that accepts 
a Secure Digital (SD) card, you can simply pop the card out of your
camera and into the card reader instead of hooking the camera up to 
the computer. Note that if you’re using the new SDHC (high capacity)
cards, the reader must specifically support that type.
As another option, you can buy stand-alone card readers such as the
SanDisk model shown in Figure 8-2. This particular model accepts a vari-
ety of memory cards. Check your photo printer, too; many printers now
have card readers that accept the most popular types of cards.
Figure 8-1: You can connect the camera to the computer using the supplied USB cable.
USB plug
USB ports

I prefer to use a card reader, for
two reasons: First, when you trans-
fer via the camera, the camera
must be turned on during the
process, wasting battery power.
Second, with a card reader, I don’t
have to keep track of that elusive
camera cable. And third, when I
copy photos to my desktop
system, transferring via the
camera requires that I get down on
all fours to plug the cable into the
computer’s USB slot, which is of
course located in the least conve-
nient spot possible. The card
reader, by contrast, stays perched
on my desk, connected to my com-
puter at all times, so there’s very
little physical activity involved in
transferring pictures, which is how
I prefer to live my life.
If you want to transfer directly
from the camera, however, the
next section explains some important steps you need to take to make that
option work. If you choose to use a card reader, skip ahead to the section
“Starting the transfer process” to get an overview of what happens after you
insert the card into the reader.
Connecting camera and computer
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for the process to work smoothly, Canon suggests that
your computer be running one of the following operating systems:
 Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise,
or Ultimate edition
 Windows XP with Service Pack 2
 Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later
 Mac OS X 10.3 and higher

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd),
check the support pages on the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) for the
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, the next steps show you how to get your
camera to talk to your computer:
1. Assess the level of the camera
battery.
Just look at the little battery-
status indicator at the bottom 
of the Camera Settings display. 
If the battery is low, charge it
before continuing. Running out
of battery power during the
transfer process can cause
problems, including lost picture
data. Alternatively, if you pur-
chased the optional AC adapter,
use that to power the camera
during picture transfers.
2. Turn the computer on and give
it time to finish its normal
startup routine.
3. Turn the camera off.
4. Insert the smaller of the two
plugs on the USB cable into the
USB port on the side of the
camera.
The slot is hidden under a little
rubber door just around the
corner from the buttons that
flank the left side of the monitor,
as shown in Figure 8-3. Gently pry open the little door and insert the
cable end into the slot.
5. Plug the other end of the cable into the computer’s USB port.
Be sure to plug the cable into a port that is actually built in to the com-
puter, as opposed to one that’s on your keyboard or part of an external
USB hub. Those accessory-type connections can sometimes foul up the
transfer process.
USB port
Figure 8-3: The USB port is hidden under the
little rubber door on the left rear side of the
camera.

6. Turn the camera on.
The Camera Settings screen appears briefly on the camera monitor, dis-
playing a “Busy” message. Then the monitor goes black and the card
access lamp (just to the right of the Erase button) begins flickering, let-
ting you know that the camera is communicating with the computer.
After a few moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your com-
puter), the Direct Transfer screen appears on the camera monitor, as
shown in Figure 8-4, and the Print/Share light, in the center of the WB
button, glows blue.
For details about the next step in the downloading routine, move on to
the next section.
The options you see on the Direct
Transfer screen relate to a method of
image downloading that requires you
to handle everything through the
camera menus. I don’t cover this
download technique because I think
that most people will find the alterna-
tive methods I discuss here easier and
more user-friendly. Nor do I cover the
Transfer Order item on the Playback
menu, which is related to the process.
However, if you’re curious about the
Wallpaper option on the Direct
Transfer screen, turn to Chapter 11,
which explains it. Your camera manual
also includes specifics about the other
download technique as well.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow the
steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 On a Windows-based computer, a Windows message box like the one
in Figure 8-5 appears. The box suggests different programs that you can
use to download your picture files. Which programs appear depend on
what you have installed on your system; if you installed the Canon soft-
ware, for example, one or more of those programs should appear in the
list. To proceed, just click the transfer program that you want to use and
then click OK. (The figure features the Windows XP Home Edition ver-
sion of the dialog box.)
229
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Figure 8-4: When the camera is ready to
download images, the Direct Transfer
screen appears.

230
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you want to use the same program for all of your transfers, select the
Always Use This Program for This Action check box, as I did in Figure
8-5. The next time you connect your camera or insert a memory card,
Windows will automatically launch your program of choice instead of
displaying the message box.
 An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download
wizard. For example, if you installed the Canon software, the EOS Utility
window or MemoryCard Utility window may leap to the forefront. Or, if
you installed some other program, such as Photoshop Elements, its
downloader may pop up instead. On the Mac, the built-in iPhoto soft-
ware may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.apple.
com, offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from
the previous program.
If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or
camera is properly connected, all
is probably well. Someone —
maybe even you — simply may
have disabled all the automatic
downloaders on your system.
Just launch your photo software
and then transfer your pictures
using whatever command starts
that process. (I show you how to
do it with the Canon software
tools later in the chapter; for
other programs, consult the soft-
ware manual.)
As another option, you can use
Windows Explorer or the Mac
Finder to simply drag and drop
files from your memory card to
your computer’s hard drive. The
process is exactly the same as
when you move any other file from a CD, DVD, or other storage device
onto your hard drive.
Figure 8-5: Windows may display this initial
boxful of transfer options.

As I say in the introduction to this chapter, it’s impossible to give step-by-
step instructions for using all the various photo downloaders that may be
sprinkled over your hard drive. So in the next sections, I provide details on
using Canon software to download and organize your files.
If you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Downloading images with Canon tools
The software CD that shipped with your Rebel XSi/450D includes several pro-
grams for transferring, organizing, and editing your photos. For downloading
images, I suggest that you use the tools discussed in the next two sections.
231
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy 
a long, healthy life, follow these storage 
guidelines:
 Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive for
long-term, archival storage. Hard drives
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives.
 Camera memory cards, flash memory keys,
and other portable storage devices are sim-
ilarly risky. All are easily damaged if
dropped or otherwise mishandled. And
being of diminutive stature, these portable
storage options also are easily lost.
 The best way to store important files is to
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for
brand-name CDs that have a gold coating
and are advertised as archival quality,
which offer a higher level of security than
other coatings.
 Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of
holding lots more data than a CD. However,
as of today, the industry still hasn’t settled
on a single, standard DVD format, and we
don’t yet have the archival-level gold coat-
ing for DVDs that’s available for CDs. For
those reasons, I’m not quite as comfortable
with DVDs as I am with CDs. So I use DVDs
only for noncritical images; precious family
photos go on CDs.
 Online photo-sharing sites such as
Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t
designed to be long-term storage tanks for
your images. Consider them only a backup
to your backup, and read the site terms
carefully so that you understand how long
the site will hold onto your files if you stop
buying prints and other products. 

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Before you try the download steps, however, you may want to visit the Canon
Web site and download the latest versions of the software in the suite. Even if
you recently bought your camera, the shipping CD may be a little out of date.
Just go to www.canon.com and follow the links to locate the software for your
camera. (You can also download updated manuals.)
In this book, the steps relate to version 2.4 of the EOS Utility and version 6.1.1
for ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). As I write this,
those versions are the most recent available. 
After taking care of the software download and installation chores, see the
next two sections for details on how to transfer your images.
Using EOS Utility to transfer images from your camera
Follow these steps to transfer images directly from your camera to the com-
puter using the Canon EOS Utility software:
1. Connect your camera to the computer.
See the first part of this chapter for specifics.
2. Turn the camera on.
After a few moments, the EOS Utility window should appear automati-
cally. If it doesn’t, just launch the program as you would any other on
your system. Figure 8-6 shows the Windows version of the screen; the
Mac version looks the same.
Figure 8-6: EOS Utility is designed for sending pictures from the 
camera to the computer.

3. Click the option named Lets You Select and Download Images.
With this option, you can specify which pictures you want to download
from the camera. After you click the option, you see a browser window
that looks similar to the one in Figure 8-7. The figure shows the Windows
version, but the Mac version contains the same components.
Along the right third of the window, you see thumbnails of the images cur-
rently on your camera or card. (Click the magnifying glass icons in the
lower-right corner of the window to enlarge or reduce the thumbnail size.)
4. Select the images that you want to copy to the computer.
Each thumbnail contains a check box in its lower-left corner. To select
an image for downloading, click the box to put a check mark in it.
For a quick way to select all images, press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A
(Mac). Or choose Edit➪Select Image➪Select All.
5. Click the Download button at the bottom of the window.
Now you see a screen that tells you where the program wants to store
your downloaded pictures. Figure 8-8 shows the Windows version of this
notice; the Mac version contains the same options.
Figure 8-7: Select the thumbnails of the images you want to transfer.
233
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

234
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-8: You can specify where you want to store the photos.
By default, pictures are stored in the My Pictures or Pictures folder in
Windows (depending on the version of Windows you use) and in the
Pictures folder on a Mac. You can put your images anywhere you like;
however, most photo editing programs look first for photos in those fold-
ers, so sticking with this universally accepted setup makes some sense.
6. Verify or change the storage location for your pictures.
If you want to put the pictures in a location different from what the pro-
gram suggests, click the Destination Folder button and specify the stor-
age location and folder name you prefer. You also can choose to have
the picture files renamed when they’re copied; click the File Name
button to access the renaming options.
7. Click OK to begin the download.
A progress window appears, showing you the status of the download. 
As the images are downloaded, each one appears for a brief moment in 
a preview window.
8. When the download is complete, turn off the camera.
You can then safely remove the cables connecting it to the computer.
That’s the basic process, but I need to share a couple of fine points:
 Setting download preferences: While the camera is still connected and
turned on, you can click the Preferences button at the bottom of the EOS
Utility browser (shown in Figure 8-7) to open a dialog box where you can
specify many aspects of how the transfer program works. Figure 8-9
shows the Windows version; Figure 8-10, the Mac version.

Figure 8-9: In Windows, click the tabs at the top of the window to access download options.
Figure 8-10: On a Mac, select a panel of options from the top drop-down list.
235
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

236
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
In Windows, click the tabs at the top of the Preferences dialog box to
reveal all your options. (You may need to use the scroll arrows at the
right side of the tabs to access hidden tabs.) On a Mac, display the 
various panels by choosing them from the drop-down list at the top of
the dialog box.
 Auto-launching the other Canon programs: After the download is com-
plete, the EOS Utility may automatically launch Canon Digital Photo
Professional or ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) so
that you can immediately start working with your pictures. (You must
have installed the programs for this to occur.)
If you want to change the program that’s launched, visit the Linked
Software panel of the EOS Utility’s Preferences dialog box. You then can
select the program that you want to use or choose None to disable auto-
launch altogether.
 Closing the EOS Utility: The utility doesn’t close automatically after the
download is complete. So you must return to the program window and
click the Quit button to shut it down.
Using MemoryCard Utility for 
card-to-computer transfers
Transferring images from a memory card reader involves a different Canon
tool, MemoryCard Utility. This tool is actually a component of ZoomBrowser
EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). To try it out, take these steps:
1. Put your card in your card reader. 
If all the planets are aligned — meaning that the Canon software was the
last photo software you installed, and some other program doesn’t try
to handle the job for you — the MemoryCard Utility window shown in
Figure 8-11 appears automatically when you put your memory card into
the card reader. The figure shows the Windows version of the window;
the Mac version is identical except that the top of the window refers to
ImageBrowser, which is the Mac version of ZoomBrowser EX.
If the window doesn’t appear, you can access it as follows:
• Windows: Open the program called ZoomBrowser EX MemoryCard
Utility, using the steps you usually take to start a program.
• Mac: Start the program called Canon Camera Window. The program
should detect your memory card and display the MemoryCard
Utility window.

Figure 8-11: The MemoryCard Utility enables you to transfer pictures using a card reader.
2. Click Lets You Select and Download Images.
You then see the browser window shown in Figure 8-12. The figure
shows the Windows version; the Mac version contains the same basic
components but follows conventional Mac design rules. Either way,
thumbnails of the images on your memory card are displayed in the
window.
Figure 8-12: Select the images that you want to download.
237
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

238
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
Use these techniques:
• To select the first photo, click its thumbnail.
• To select additional pictures, Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click
(Mac) their thumbnails.
• To quickly select all images in Windows, choose Select All from the
Select drop-down list, located on the toolbar near the top of the
window. On a Mac, the
list is called Select
Image and is located at
the bottom of the
window. (You also can
just press Ctrl+A in
Windows or Ô+A on a
Mac.)
4. Click the Image Download
button.
In Windows, the button’s near
the top-left corner of the
browser window; on a Mac,
it’s in the bottom-left corner.
Either way, a new window
appears to show you where
the downloader wants to put
your files and the name it
plans to assign the storage
folder, as shown in Figure 8-13.
If you’re not happy with the program’s choices, click the Change Settings
button to open a dialog box where you can select a different storage
location. In the same dialog box, you can also choose to have the picture
files renamed when they’re copied. Click OK to close the Change
Settings dialog box when you finish.
Remember: Most programs look first for photos stored in the location
suggested initially by the downloader. In Windows, that folder is named
either My Pictures or Pictures, depending on what version of Windows
you use. On a Mac, the folder is named Pictures. Sticking with these
default storage locations can simplify your life down the road, but of
course, you’re free to set up whatever image-organization system works
best for you.
Figure 8-13: Click the Change Settings button
to specify a different download folder.

5. Click the Starts Download button.
Your files start making their way to your computer. When the down-
load is finished, the MemoryCard Utility window closes, and either
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) appears, display-
ing your downloaded files. See the next section for details on using that
program.
Using ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
In addition to the aforementioned software tools, your Canon CD contains two
additional programs: ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac),
plus Digital Photo Professional. In this section, you can find out how to orga-
nize your photos using the ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser tool. Although
you can view thumbnails of your images in Digital Photo Professional, that
tool is designed for advanced users, so I don’t cover it in this book.
The next sections give you the most basic of introductions to ZoomBrowser
EX/ImageBrowser, which, in the interest of saving type, I may refer to from
here on in as just “the browser.” If you want more details, the CD that ships
with the program offers a very good online manual.
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use Canon’s software to download and organize your photos
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing,
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file
that you put on your system.
Getting acquainted with the program
Figure 8-14 offers a look at the ZoomBrowser EX window; Figure 8-15, the
ImageBrowser window. As you can see, the windows contain most of the
same basic components, although the Mac version of the browser is lacking
the row of task buttons found in the upper-left corner of the Windows ver-
sion. The two versions also offer a different set of image-viewing modes —
Preview Mode and List mode on the Mac and Zoom, Scroll, and Preview
modes in Windows.
Whichever version you use, you can customize the window layout via the
View menu. The arrangement you see in the figures is the Preview mode
setup. I prefer this mode because it provides easy access not just to your
images, but also to details about the camera settings you used to shoot the
picture. Here’s a quick guide to viewing your photos in Preview mode:

 Select the folder you want to view. Click the folder’s icon in the Explore
panel, found on the left side of the window and labeled in Figures 8-14
and 8-15. If you click the Favorite Folders tab, you see only the My
Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac) along with any
custom Favorites folders that you create, a topic that you can visit in the
upcoming section “Organizing your photos.” By default, picture files that
you transfer from your camera or memory card using the Canon soft-
ware go into these folders. To view all folders on your computer, click
the All Folders button.
 Preview the images in the selected folder. In Preview mode, the current
image appears at a large size in the middle of the window, as shown in
the figures, and a “filmstrip” of smaller thumbnails appears beneath.
Figure 8-14: Click a folder in the Explore panel to display its images.

Figure 8-15: Click a thumbnail to view that image in the main preview area.
To view the next image in the filmstrip, click its thumbnail. On a Mac,
you then can press the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard to
view your photos one by one. In Windows, the same technique works on
some keyboards; if not, click the Next and Previous buttons (under the
large preview) instead. Drag the scroll bar under the thumbnails to
scroll the thumbnail display as needed.
 View an image in full-screen mode. For a larger view of a photo, double-
click its thumbnail. (You must double-click the thumbnail, not the larger
preview image.) Doing so opens the image in its own browser window,
displaying the image as large as possible to fit the available screen
space. This full-screen window is called the Viewer window. The next
section explains more about the controls therein. To exit the Viewer
window and return to the main browser, just click the window’s close
button.

as metadata — is a great way to better understand what settings work
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting
up to speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the
other digital photography basics. (Note that you may need to scroll the

depending on the size of the program window.
Those are the basics of navigating through your images. In the next section,
you can find some hints about viewing your photos in full-screen mode,
inside the Viewer window. After that, the section “Organizing your photos”
explains how to customize the folder setup that the Canon software creates
for you.
Viewing photos in full-screen mode
Double-clicking a thumbnail in the main browser window displays the image
inside the Viewer window. Figure 8-16 shows the Windows version of the
Viewer; Figure 8-17 shows the Mac alternative.
After opening an image in the Viewer window, use these tricks to inspect it
more closely:
 Magnify the image. You can zoom in on your image for a closer look by
using these techniques:
• In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows): Drag the Zoom slider or click the
preview with the Zoom In tool, both labeled in Figure 8-16.
• In ImageBrowser (Mac): Choose a specific magnification level from
the Display Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 8-17.
 Scroll a magnified image. After you magnify the photo, a tiny Navigator
window appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown in the fig-
ures. The little red triangles in the Navigator window indicate the area
that you’re currently viewing in the main preview. To scroll the display
to see another portion of the image, put your cursor in the Navigator
window, within the area bounded by those little red triangles, and drag.
In Windows, you also can click the Hand tool, labeled in Figure 8-16, and
drag in the preview itself. On a Mac, just drag in the preview; your
cursor automatically sets itself to Hand-tool mode as soon as you
enlarge the image display.

Figure 8-16: To display an image in the Viewer window, double-click its thumbnail.
 Reduce the view size. In Windows, click the preview with the Zoom Out
tool or use the Zoom slider. (See Figure 8-16.) On a Mac, choose a
smaller zoom size from the Display Size drop-down list.
To zoom out so that you can see the entire image, click the Fit to Window
button in Windows. (See Figure 8-16.) On a Mac, choose Fit to Window
from the Display Size list instead.

Figure 8-17: The Mac version of the Viewer window looks like this.
 View the next image in the folder. If you want to inspect more images 
in the Viewer, just click the Previous and Next buttons, labeled in Fig-
ure 8-16, if you use Windows. On a Mac, click the Back or Next button
located under the preview.
 Edit the photo. To use the editing tools provided with the program, click
open the Edit drop-down list, found above the preview in Windows and
beneath it on a Mac. Then select the editing task you want to perform.
Chapter 10 provides more details about shifting into editing mode and
using the available tools.
Keep in mind that the preceding tidbits just give you the basics of using the

Organizing your photos
By default, the Canon download soft-
ware puts your picture files into either
the My Pictures or Pictures folder in
Windows and the Pictures folder on a
Mac. Within that folder, the download-
ing tools organize the images by
shooting date, creating a new folder
for each date found on the memory
card, as shown in Figure 8-18. Each
folder contains only the images shot
on that particular day.
If you don’t like this organizational
structure, you can change it. For
example, you may want to organize
images by category — family, travel,
work, and so on. I took this approach
to customize my folder collection in
Figure 8-18.
To keep things simple, I suggest that
you add these custom folders within
the My Pictures or Pictures folder
(Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac). That way, you’ll always know where to
look for images on your computer’s hard drive. And programs that default to
looking to those folders for photos will be able to find them as well. The next
mini-sections show you the basics you need to create custom folders and
then organize images in them.
Creating custom folders
Take these steps to add a folder to the My Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or
Pictures (Mac) list:
1. Click the Favorite Folders tab of the Explore panel, if it isn’t already
visible.
2. Click My Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or Pictures (Mac).
The folder should appear highlighted.
3. Choose File➪New Folder.
The New Folder dialog box appears.
4. Type the name of the folder in the text box and click OK.
Your folder appears as a subfolder under the My Pictures or Pictures
folder.
245
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Figure 8-18: You can create custom folders
to organize images by category.

246
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
To create a subfolder within your new folder, follow the same process, but
click the new folder in Step 2. For example, I created two subfolders within
my Travel folder in Figure 8-18.
Managing your image collection
After you create your folders, you can place images into them in two ways:
 Move an image from one folder to another. Display the image thumb-
nail and then drag it to the desired folder. The program moves the image
file to the new folder and removes it from the old one.
 Download new images directly to your desired folder. You can specify
a custom folder as the download destination when you use the EOS
Utility and MemoryCard Utility software to transfer images. See the ear-
lier sections of this chapter for details.
Use these techniques to maintain and further organize your image collection:
 Delete a folder. First, click the folder name to select it. Then, in Windows,
choose File➪Delete. On a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. In both cases,
the program displays a message asking you to confirm that you want to
get rid of the folder; click Yes (Windows) or OK (Mac) to proceed. 
Be careful: This step deletes both the folder and all images inside it!
 Rename a folder. Click the folder and choose File➪Rename. In the
dialog box that appears, type the new folder name and then click OK.
 Rename a picture file. Click the image thumbnail and choose File➪
Rename. Type the new name in the dialog box that appears and then
click OK. Note: Do not type the three-letter file extension (.jpg or .CR2)
at the end of the new filename. The program adds that data automati-
cally to the filename for you.
 Delete a picture. Click the image thumbnail to select it. Then, in Windows,
choose File➪Delete; on a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. As with delet-
ing a folder, you’re presented with a dialog box asking you whether you
really, really want to dump that image. Respond in the affirmative to do so.
Exploring Other Software Options
The Canon browser software is a pretty nifty tool for viewing and organizing
your photos. And it does enable you to perform basic retouching: You can
crop your image and make some adjustments to color, exposure, and sharp-
ness. Chapter 10 shows you how.

But the program isn’t designed for serious photo editing. For one thing, you
can’t perform selective editing — meaning, changing only the part of your
image that needs help. And you don’t get any tools for removing flaws such
as blemishes in portraits and the like.
So my recommendation is that you consider the browser as a good, free tool
for organizing your photos and doing simple picture fixes. But if you find
yourself doing a lot of photo editing, invest in something more capable. Here
are just some of the products to consider:
 Beginning/consumer programs: Unless you’re retouching photos for
professional purposes or want to get into photo editing at a serious level
for other reasons, a program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements ($100,
www.adobe.com) is a good fit. Elements has been the best-selling con-
sumer photo editor for some time, and for good reason. With a full com-
plement of retouching tools, onscreen guidance for novices, a built-in
photo organizer, and an assortment of tools and templates for creating
artistic photo projects, Elements offers all the features that most con-
sumers need.
Figure 8-19 offers a look at Elements 6 for Windows; the program is also
available in a Mac version.
Figure 8-19: Adobe Photoshop Elements offers a good balance of power and ease-of-use.

For other candidates in this category and price range, visit the Web sites
of Corel (www.corel.com) and ArcSoft (www.arcsoft.com). Both compa-
nies offer multiple programs aimed at the beginner-to-intermediate user.
 Advanced/professional tools: The best-known option in this category is
Adobe Photoshop, shown in Figure 8-20. Photoshop offers professional-
grade photo editing tools, a built-in photo organizer, and features
needed by people preparing images for commercial printing, Web
design, and other high-end uses.
Of course, all that power comes at a price: $650. And expect to spend
lots of time getting up to speed with the program, too, because you
don’t get the friendly interfaces and guidance offered by the beginner-
level programs. Nor does Photoshop offer the automated photo-creation
features, such as greeting card templates and clip art, that you find in
consumer programs.
Other programs aimed at the professional market include Apple
Aperture ($300, www.apple.com) and Adobe Lightroom (also $300).
These two programs are geared toward users who routinely need to
process lots of images but who typically do only light retouching work.
Figure 8-20: Adobe Photoshop is designed for advanced users and imaging professionals.

A few important tips before you buy:
 Check the software’s system requirements to make sure that your com-
puter can run the program. Some of the products I mention here aren’t
available for Macintosh computers; Apple Aperture, on the other hand,
isn’t available for Windows-based systems. Also make sure that your
computer offers the system memory (RAM), processor speed, and other
components that the software requires.
 You also can buy stand-alone photo organizing programs if you aren’t
interested in serious photo editing but want a more powerful image-
management tool than you get with the Canon software. Check out the
offerings in this category from ACDSee (www.acdsee.com), ThumbsPlus
(www.thumbsplus.com), and Extensis (www.extensis.com). 
You may be amused, as I am, to know that the photo industry uses the
term DAM software — for digital asset management — to refer to the
function provided by image-organizing programs. (I dare you to walk
into your local computer store and ask where you can find the DAM soft-
ware. Wait; I double-dare you.)
 Many software companies enable you to download free trials from their
Web sites so that you can actually use the software for a short period to
make sure that it fits your needs.

Using your mouse as a shutter button
Along with providing a convenient way for you
to download images, the EOS Utility software
enables you to use your computer to actually
shoot pictures as well.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, clicking the Camera Settings/Remote
Shooting button in the main EOS Utility window
displays a panel containing clickable controls
for adjusting the major camera settings, such as
aperture, white balance, ISO, and metering
mode. After you establish those settings, you
click another button to record whatever scene
is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, this feature is great in
scenarios that make having a live photographer
close to the subject either difficult or dangerous
— for example, trying to get a shot of a chemi-
cal reaction in a science lab or capture an
image of an animal that’s shy around humans.
Additionally, the software enables easy time-
lapse photography, enabling you to set the
camera to take pictures automatically at spec-
ified intervals over a period of minutes, hours,
or even days. 

250
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Processing Raw (CR2) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you
to capture images as raw data. The advantage of capturing Raw files, which
are called CR2 files on your Rebel XSi/450D, is that you make the decisions
about how to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can
specify attributes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and
so on — all of which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its
other file format, JPEG.
The bad news: You have to specify attributes such as color intensity, image
sharpening, contrast, and so on before you can do anything with your pic-
tures. Although you can print them immediately if you use the Canon soft-
ware, you can’t take them to a photo lab for printing, share them online, or
edit them in your photo software until you process them using a tool known
as a raw converter. At the end of the conversion process, you save the fin-
ished file in a standard file format, such as JPEG or TIFF.
If you do decide to shoot in the Raw format, you can process them with
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
1. Click the image thumbnail in the browser window.
2. In Windows, choose Tools➪Processing Raw Images; on a Mac, choose
File➪Processing Raw Image.
A message window may appear to provide you with general instructions
about the conversion. Just click OK to close the window and move on. 
(If you don’t want to be bothered with it each time you want to process
a Raw image, select the Don’t Show This Message Again check box
before you close the window.)
Now your photo appears inside the Raw Image Task window, shown in
Figure 8-21. (The window may appear slightly different, depending on
the options you choose in the View menu.)
3. Use the controls on the Image Quality adjustment panel to adjust the
image as needed.
Figure 8-22 gives you a look at the Windows version of the panel; the
Mac version contains the same components but is arranged a little dif-
ferently. Drag the scroll bar on the right side of the panel to scroll the
display as needed to access all the controls.
The panel offers the following controls:
• Digital Exposure Compensation: Drag this slider to adjust image
brightness.

Figure 8-21: You can convert Raw images using the browser’s Raw Image Task tool.
• White Balance: These controls, based on the white balance options
discussed in Chapter 6, adjust color. You can click one of the white
balance icons in the large panel, or you can drag the A/B (amber/
blue) and M/G (magenta/green) sliders to tweak the colors. Or
click the little white balance eyedropper, labeled in Figure 8-22, and
then click an area of the image that should be white, black, or gray.
• Picture Style: Here, you can actually apply one of the camera’s
Picture Style options to the photo. Or you can customize the style
by dragging the Sharpness, Contrast, Color Saturation, and Color
Tone sliders. (If you select Monochrome as the Picture Style, the
Color Saturation and Color Tone sliders are replaced by the filter
Effect and Toning Effect sliders.) Chapter 6 talks about Picture
Styles.
• Color Space: You can select either sRGB or Adobe RGB as the image
color space. As discussed in Chapter 6, the latter offers a broader
range of colors, although some of them may be beyond the print-
able range.
• Noise Reduction: If you select On for this option, the converter
applies a filter designed to soften noise, a defect that gives the
image a grainy look. The filter works by applying a slight blur to
the photo, so use with caution.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
At any time, you can revert the image to
the original settings by clicking the Shot
Settings button underneath the Image
Adjustment panel. (See Figure 8-21.)
4. Choose File➪Save Image.
You see the Save dialog box shown in
Figure 8-23.
5. Set the Save options.
Here’s the rundown on the options that
may be foreign to you:
• Conversion Target (Windows) or
Images to Save (Mac): These options
matter only if you are processing
multiple images at a time. If you
want to do this, the Help system
available in the Raw Image Task
window provides how-to’s.
• Image Type: This one is the critical
setting. Choose EXIF-Tiff (8 bits/
channel). This saves your image in
the TIFF file format, which preserves
all image data. Don’t choose the
JPEG format; doing so is destructive
to the photo because of the lossy
compression that is applied.
Chapter 3 has details.
• Resolution: This option does not
adjust the pixel count of your image, as you might imagine. It only
sets the default output resolution that will be used if you send the
photo to a printer. Most photo editing programs enable you to
adjust this value before printing. The Canon software does not,
however, so if you plan to print through the browser, I suggest you
set this value to 300. Chapter 9 talks more about printing.
• Save Folder and Rename File: Use these options to specify a stor-
age folder and filename for your converted image. 
6. Click Save.
A progress box appears to let you know that the conversion and file-
saving is going forward.
7. Close the Raw Image Task window to return to the browser.
White balance eyedropper
Figure 8-22: Set the characteristics
of your photo here.

As you can probably tell from looking at the Raw Task Window in Figure 8-21,
these steps give you only a basic overview of the process. If you do regularly
shoot in the Raw format, take the time to explore the Raw Task Window Help
system so that you can take advantage of its other features.
Figure 8-23: Always save your processed files in the TIFF format.
Also know that this raw processor isn’t your only option. Digital Photo
Professional, provided in the Canon software suite, offers its own raw conver-
sion tools. Because that program is designed for the more advanced user, the
conversion tools are slightly more complex, but they’re also a little more
powerful in some regards. Additionally, both Adobe Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements offer excellent raw converters. 
Whichever converter you choose, keep these final pointers in mind:
 Always save your processed files in a nondestructive format, such as
TIFF. (If you use Adobe Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, its format,
PSD, is also nondestructive.) If you need a JPEG image to share online,
Chapter 9 shows you how to create a duplicate of your original, con-
verted image in that format.
253
Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos

254
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 Some raw converters, including the ones in the Canon programs, give
you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. (A bit is a unit of computer
data; the more bits you have, the more colors your image can contain.)
Many photo editing programs either can’t open 16-bit files or limit you
to a few editing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit
image option. Your image will contain more than enough colors, and
you’ll avoid potential conflicts caused by so-called high-bit images.
 Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. Chapter 10
offers some additional information about sharpening and saturation to
help you find the right amounts of each.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print,
it was pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-
high prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail
photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, and online printing
services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good out-
come. Your Rebel XSi/450D can produce dynamic
prints even at large sizes, and getting those prints
made is easy and economical, thanks to an abun-
dance of digital printing services now in stores and
online. And for home printing, today’s printers are
better and cheaper than ever, too.
That said, getting the best output from your camera still
requires a little bit of knowledge and prep work on your
part. To that end, this chapter tells you exactly how to ensure
that your picture files will look as good on paper as they do in your
camera monitor.

256
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures electronically.
First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an important step
if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering their inboxes with
ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you can find out how to
create a digital slide show, view your pictures on a television, and join online
photo-sharing communities.
Avoiding Printing Problems
Although digital printing has come a long way in the past couple of years, a
few issues still can cause hiccups in the printing process. So before you print
your photos, whether you want to do it on your own printer or send them to
a lab, read through the next three sections, which show you how to avoid the
most common trouble spots.
Check the pixel count before you print
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality.
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick
recap as it relates to printing:
 On your Rebel XSi/450D, you set picture resolution via the Quality
option, found on Shooting Menu 1. You must select this option before
you capture an image, which means that you need some idea of your
ultimate print size before you shoot. And remember that if you crop
your image, you eliminate some pixels, so take that factor into account
when you do the resolution math. 
 For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience,
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi.
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably
those from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However,
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right resolu-
tion is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)

 If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine the
resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print size.
But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution cop.
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print
size or print quality.
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things must
happen:
 The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size to fill
the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a defect
known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairstepped,
along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually make out
the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look more like a mosaic
than, well, a photograph.
 The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels to
fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in your
photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the low
resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo infor-
mation out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks worse
than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details turn
muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 show you the same image as
it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of this book),
at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, there’s just
no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you need the right
pixel count from the get-go.
Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your Rebel XSi/450D produces images that have
an aspect ratio of 3:2. That is, images are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just
like a 35mm film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to the
standard 4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images,
which means the pictures must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 
8 x 10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those pro-
portions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.

Figure 9-1: A high-quality print depends on a high-resolution original.
As a point of reference, both images in Figure 9-3 show you an original, 
3:2 image. The blue outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a
5-x-7-inch frame and an 8-x-10-inch frame.
Chapter 10 shows you how to crop your image using the free Canon software
that shipped with your camera. You also can usually crop your photo using
the software provided at online printing sites and at retail print kiosks. But if
you plan to simply drop off your memory card for printing at a lab, be sure to
find out whether the printer automatically crops the image without your
input. If so, use your photo software to crop the photo, save the cropped
image to your memory card, and deliver that version of the file to the printer. 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as I did for the example in
Figure 9-3. Then you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what
print size you choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head
room, especially when describing portrait composition.)

Get print and monitor colors in sync
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue,
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 Your monitor needs to be
calibrated. When print
colors don’t match what
you see on your computer
monitor, the most likely
culprit is actually the moni-
tor, not the printer. If the
monitor isn’t accurately
calibrated, the colors it dis-
plays aren’t a true reflec-
tion of your image colors.
To ensure that your moni-
tor is displaying photos on
a neutral canvas, you can
start with a software-based
calibration utility, which is
just a small program that
guides you through the
process of adjusting your
monitor. The program 
displays various color
swatches and other graph-
ics and then asks you to
provide feedback about
what you see on the screen.
If you use a Mac, the oper-
ating system offers a built-
in calibration utility, called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-4
shows the welcome screen that appears when you run the program.
(Access it by opening the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the
Displays icon, clicking the Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate
button.) You also can find free calibration software for both Mac and
Windows systems online; just enter the term free monitor calibration 
software into your favorite search engine.

Software-based tools, though, depend on your eyes to make decisions
during the calibration process. For a more reliable calibration, you may
want to invest in a hardware solution, such as the Pantone Huey ($90,
www.pantone.com) or the ColorVision Spyder2express ($70, www. 
colorvision.com). These products use a device known as a colorimeter to
accurately measure your display colors.
Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every
month or so, as monitor colors drift over time.
 One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints look
great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is an
empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
If black-and-white prints have a color tint, you might assume that your
black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the problem
is usually a color cartridge instead. Most printers use both color and
black inks even for black-and-white prints, and if one color is missing, a
tint results.
When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-party
brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the perfor-
mance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manufacturer. 
A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the printer’s
ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously knows most
about that delivery system.
 You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced,
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 Your printer and photo software are fighting over color management
duties. Some photo programs offer color management tools, which are
features that enable the user to control how colors are handled as an
image passes from camera to monitor to printer. Most printer software
also offers color management features. The problem is, if you enable
color management controls both in your photo software and your printer
software, you can create conflicts that lead to wacky colors. So check
your photo software and printer manuals to find out what color manage-
ment options are available to you and how to turn them on and off.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t repro-
duce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition,
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source
has its own influence on the colors you see.
Printing Online or In-Store
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless,
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail
photo lab.
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, 
I suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing
with the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in
the required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come
out ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:
 Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little
as an hour.
 Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house.
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick
up your prints at a local store.

This service is a great way to share prints with friends and family who
don’t live nearby. I can upload and order prints from my desk in
Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed at a store located a few
miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
Printing from ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
If you prefer to print your own pictures on a home or office printer, the
process is much the same as printing anything from your computer: You
open the picture file in your photo software of choice, choose File➪Print, and
specify the print size, paper size, paper type, and so on, as usual.
The following steps show you how to get the job done using Canon
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Chapter 8 introduces
you to this free software, so you may want to pop over to that chapter to find
out how to browse your images using the program, if you haven’t already
done so. Then walk this way:
1. Click the thumbnail for the image that you want to print. 
2. Choose File➪Print➪Photo Print.
Your image then appears inside the Photo Print window, shown in Figure
9-5. The figure shows the Windows XP version of the Photo Print fea-
tures. If you’re a Mac user, your window lacks the gray task panel that
appears on the left in Windows, but don’t fret: The critical printing set-
tings remain the same, albeit with a slightly different look.
3. Select a printer.
In Windows, choose the printer from the Name drop-down list. On a
Mac, select your printer from the Printer drop-down list.
4. Specify your printer settings.
• Windows: Click the Properties button.
• Mac: Click the Page Setup button.
Either way, you’re taken to the standard print-setup dialog box for your
printer. The options therein depend on your printer, so check your
manual for guidance. But be sure to specify the following settings:
• Paper size
• Paper type (glossy, plain paper, and so on)
• Borderless printing on or off (if your printer offers this feature)
263
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

264
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-5: Your first step is to select a printer and paper size.
The browser software automatically chooses the print orientation 
(portrait or landscape) that best fits the image on the page. Even though
you can select an orientation option in your printer setup dialog box,
the program overrides you later if it deems necessary.
When you finish establishing the printer settings, click OK to return to
the Photo Print window.
5. Adjust the image cropping as necessary.
By default, the browser automatically enlarges and/or crops your image
to fit your chosen paper size if necessary. To see exactly what has been
cropped in Windows, click the Trim Image button. On a Mac, click the
button labeled Remove Unwanted Regions of Your Photo.
In both cases, your image opens in the Trim Image editing window,
shown in Figure 9-6, which contains some of the controls that you see
when you use the program’s editing functions.

265
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Figure 9-6: You can adjust the image cropping if needed.
Chapter 10 details the Trim Image editing controls, but here’s the short
story:
• The box with the little white squares around it indicates the crop
box. Anything outside the box won’t be printed.
• Drag any of those squares to adjust the size of the crop box. You’re
limited to setting the box to the same proportions as your selected
paper size.
• Drag inside the box to move it over a different part of the photo.
• Click the Orientation icons (Windows) or Trimming Frame buttons
(Mac) if you want to change the layout of the cropping box (hori-
zontal or vertical).
• Click OK to apply the new cropping and return to the Photo Print
window.
Crop box

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If you don’t want your photo to be cropped or enlarged at all, you need
to exit the printing process and adjust a program preference. See the
end of these steps for details.
6. Add the shooting date/time (optional).
You can print the date and time that the photo was taken by choosing an
option from the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list in the Photo Print
window (see Figure 9-5). The program determines the date and time
from data in the image file.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your Rebel XSi/450D offers two features that
enable you to print directly from your camera or
memory card — without using the computer as
middle-machine — assuming that your printer
offers the required options.
The first of these features, called DPOF, stands
for Digital Print Order Format. With this option,
accessed via your camera’s Playback menu,
you select the pictures on your memory card
that you want to print, and you specify how
many copies you want of each image. Then, if
your photo printer has a Secure Digital (SD)
memory card slot and supports DPOF, you just
pop the memory card into that slot. The printer
reads your “print order” and outputs just the
requested copies of your selected images. (You
use the printer’s own controls to set paper size,
print orientation, and other print settings.)
A second direct-printing feature, called
PictBridge, works a little differently. If you have
a PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can
connect the camera to the printer using 
the USB cable supplied with your camera. A
PictBridge interface appears on the camera
monitor, and you use the camera controls to
select the pictures you want to print. With
PictBridge, you specify additional print options,
such as page size and whether you want to print
a border around the photo, from the camera as
well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and
want to deliver prints to guests before they go
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing
up your computer, downloading pictures, and so
on. And if you invest in one of the tiny portable
photo printers on the market today, you can
easily make prints away from your home or
office — you can take both your portable printer
and camera along to your regional sales meet-
ing, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with
cabling the printer and camera together. Also,
the camera must be turned on for the whole
printing process, wasting battery power. But if
you’re interested in exploring either printing fea-
ture, your camera manual provides complete
details.

267
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
If you do choose to print the date and time, click the Properties button
to set the font, size, and placement of the type.
7. Add a caption to the photo (optional).
To add more type to your photo, click the Insert Text button (Windows)
or the Add or Modify Text to Print with This Photo button (Mac). Either
way, you’re taken to the Insert Text window, which offers most of the
same text tools as the regular Insert Text window, which I cover at the
end of Chapter 10. If you add text, click OK to close the Insert Text
window and return to the Photo Print window when you’re finished.
8. Click the Print button.
Your photo file is shipped to the printer.
As I mentioned in Step 5, you can choose to turn off the automatic cropping
that occurs by default. First, close the Photo Print window if it’s open. Then
take these steps:
 Windows: Choose Tools➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog
box. Click the Printing tab and select the Do Not Allow Trimming of the
Image option. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 Mac: Choose ImageBrowser➪Preferences. Select Photo Print from the
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box that appears. Then select Do
Not Trim and click OK.
If you take this step, the Trim function inside the Photo Print dialog box
becomes disabled, so you must do any cropping before you print.
Although it’s fine for casual printing, Photo Print lacks some features that are
typically found in most photo editors and even in the software that ships
with most photo printers. You can’t print multiple images on the same page,
for example, or even multiple copies of the same photo. So if you own other
software, you may find it more convenient than using the browser’s print
functions.
Whatever software you use, be sure to follow the resolution guidelines set
out near the beginning of this chapter. And note that the Photo Print window
doesn’t warn you if your image doesn’t contain enough pixels to produce a
good print at the size you select. So before you begin printing, check that
pixel count by displaying the Shooting Information panel in the main browser
window. The Image Size listing, highlighted in Figure 9-7, shows you the pixel
count.

268
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-7: Make sure that the pixel count is adequate for the print size. 
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one
in Figure 9-8? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your
monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number of
pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and the
capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the aver-
age photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess of
what the monitor can handle.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 450 pixels at its
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-9. This image measures 450 x 300 pixels. 
Photo resolution

Figure 9-8: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
Figure 9-9: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 450 pixels wide or tall.
269
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

270
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
This recommendation means that even if you shoot at your camera’s lowest
resolution setting (2256 x 1504 pixels), you need to dump pixels from your
images before sending them to the cyber post office. You can take care of that
task and then send the resized image right from ZoomBrowser EX (Windows)
or ImageBrowser (Mac).
As a first step, however, you need to check the file format of the photos you
want to share; they must be in the JPEG format. If they are Raw (CR2) or TIFF
images, the next section shows you how to create JPEG copies for online
sharing. If the pictures are already JPEGs, skip ahead to the section “E-mailing
photos from the browser.” 
Creating Web-friendly copies of Raw 
and TIFF photos
In Chapter 8, I advise you to save Raw files in the TIFF format after you process
them in a raw converter. TIFF is ideal because it is a nondestructive format —
that is, it retains all your picture data, resulting in the highest image quality.
But there’s one problem with TIFF files: E-mail programs and Web browsers
can’t display them. If you want to share your converted raw files online, you
need to create a copy of the file in the standard online format, JPEG.
Why not just save your converted raw files as JPEG images at the processing
stage? Because JPEG is a destructive format, eliminating some image data 
as a tradeoff for producing smaller file sizes. So the best practice is to save
your original raw conversions as TIFF files and then create JPEG copies for
online use.
In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac), you can use the
Export command to create a JPEG copy and reduce the pixel count to a reso-
lution suitable for onscreen display at the same time. Follow these steps:
1. Select the image by clicking its thumbnail in the browser.
2. Choose File➪Export➪Export Still Images (Windows) or File➪Export
Image (Mac).
Export is the geekspeak way of saying “save this file in a different
format.”
In Windows, you next see a window that contains the file-saving options,
as shown in Figure 9-10. On a Mac, you see the Write a Still Image box
instead; click Edit and Save Image and then click the Next button to get
to the file-saving options. They’re arranged a little differently on the Mac
than in Figure 9-10, but the basic controls are the same.

Figure 9-10: Use the Export command to create a JPEG copy of a TIFF photo.
3. Set the image size.
To keep the original pixel count, deselect the Resize Images During Export
check box (Windows) or Resize the Image box (Mac). If you do want to
resample the image (trim the pixel count), select the box, as shown in the
figure. Then click the Long Side option (Windows) or Specify the Length
Dimension (Mac) and type a value in the neighboring box. The value you
enter determines the number of pixels the image contains along its longest
side. When resizing the image, the program will automatically set the pixel
count of the shortest side to retain the original image proportions.
For e-mail images, I suggest setting the long side of the image to 450
pixels or less. This ensures that the recipient can view the entire image
without scrolling the e-mail window.
4. Select the Change Image Type check box.
5. Select the JPEG format from the drop-down list under the check box.
6. Use the Quality slider to set the desired image quality.
At the highest Quality setting, the program applies the least amount of
JPEG compression, which is the process that reduces file sizes by dump-
ing image data. For acceptable image quality, I suggest that you set the
slider either to Highest or High. (Your file size is already pretty small
because of the reduced pixel count.)
271
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

272
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
7. Specify a filename.
You have two options: If you deselect the Add a Prefix check box
(Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac), the program gives your
JPEG copy the same name as the original — for example, IMG_7813.TIF
becomes IMG_7813.JPG.
You also can assign a new filename. First, select the Add a Prefix check box
(Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac). Then type the text in the
adjacent text box. Note that the program automatically adds the numbers
0001 to the end of whatever text you enter. For example, if you type Web in
the box, the filename of your JPEG copy will be Web0001.jpg. If you stick
with the text that the program enters in the box for you automatically —
IMG_ — the filename will be IMG_0001.jpg.
8. Choose the folder where you want to store the JPEG file.
In Windows, you do this by using the Save to Folder option. Click Current
Folder to put the copy in the same folder as the original. Click My Pictures
(or Pictures, depending on the version of Windows you use) to put the
copy in that folder instead, or click Browse to select another folder.
In Windows, you may need to scroll the window display to access the
Save to Folder option, as shown in Figure 9-11.
Figure 9-11: Scroll the window display to reveal the Save to Folder option.

On a Mac, the current folder destination appears at the bottom of the
dialog box; click the Browse button to select a different storage bin.
9. Click Finish to save the copy.
After creating your Web-ready image, you can attach it to an e-mail message
just as you do any file.
E-mailing photos from the browser
You can resize and e-mail JPEG photos directly from ZoomBrowser EX
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
1. In the browser, select the images that you want to share.
Click the first image and then either Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click
(Mac) additional images.
2. Start the e-mail tool.
How you do it depends on your operating system:
• Windows: Choose Internet➪Send Images by Email.
• Mac: Choose Internet➪Create Image for Email.
In Windows, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-12. The Mac ver-
sion looks a little different, but it contains the same critical controls.
3. Click the Using Custom Settings button.
Why not use the program’s recommended settings? Because if you do,
your e-mail image is sized to 640 x 480 pixels. On some computer
screens, even that size is too large to be viewed without scrolling.
4. Click the Custom Settings button.
In Windows, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-13. The Mac ver-
sion contains the same basic options, plus a couple additional options
related to digital movies, which you can ignore. In both versions, the
dialog box enables you to specify the width or height of your picture and
then preview the resulting file size and onscreen display size.
5. Open the Image Size (Windows) or Still Image Size (Mac) drop-down
list and click Custom Size.
Now a second dialog box opens, offering the options shown in Figure 9-14.
Here, you can specify the exact pixel count you want the photo to have.
273
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos

274
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-12: Select Using Custom Settings and click Custom Settings to specify the pixel count.
6. Click the Long Side button and enter a size value in the adjacent box.
This value determines the maximum height of a vertically oriented pic-
ture or the maximum width of a horizontally oriented picture. Again, I
recommend a value of 450 pixels, but you make the call.
Whatever value you enter, the program will handle setting the value for
the shortest side when it resizes the image.
7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The image size you specified now appears as an option in the drop-down
list. So the next time you send an image, you can skip Steps 5 and 6 and
simply select that size from the list.
8. Specify the picture quality by dragging the Quality slider.
This setting determines how much JPEG compression is applied. As
Chapter 3 explains, JPEG compression reduces the size of a picture file
by getting rid of some image data. The more compression you apply, the
smaller the file and the lower the picture quality.

After you drag the slider, click
the Calculate button. The pro-
gram does a quick calculation,
and the Modified File Size value
then shows you the file size
that will result from the chosen
Quality setting. And if you click
the Preview button, you can
view a preview of how the
image will look at the selected
setting.
Because the new pixel count of
your photo already results in a
very small file, you can use a
high Quality setting without
worrying too much about
download times. The exception
is if you are sending a picture
to someone who uses a dial-up
connection, in which case I
would bump the Quality slider
down a notch. You also may
want to reduce the Quality
slightly if you are attaching
multiple pictures to the same
e-mail message so that the combined download time isn’t excessive.
9. Tell the program to automatically fire up your e-mail program after it
resizes the photo.
• Windows: Select the Attach to Email option.
• Mac: Select the Start Email
Application After Closing
option.
10. Click OK to close the Custom
Settings dialog box.
You’re returned to the main
e-mail utility window.
11. Click the arrow labeled
Confirm Current to review the
image size settings.
If anything is amiss, click the
Custom Settings button to
adjust the settings.
275

Figure 9-13: You can create a custom setting to
apply to all your e-mail photos.
Figure 9-14: Set the pixel count for the picture’s
longest side.

276
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
12. Click Attach to Email (Windows) or Finish (Mac).
The program creates your e-mail copy, fires up your e-mail program, and
creates a new message window. The images are automatically attached
to the message, so all you have to do is enter the recipient’s e-mail
address and any message you want to include. Then just send the 
message as you normally do.
The software does not save a copy of the resized e-mail image on your 
computer’s hard drive. If you do want to create and save a small copy of the
photo, follow Steps 1 through 8 and then proceed like so:
 Windows: Select the Save to Folder button and then click the Browse
button to select the folder where you want to store the resized copy of
the photo. In Step 12, click the Save to Folder button.
 Mac: Deselect the Attach to Email button in Step 9. Click OK to close the
Custom Settings box and then click the Finish button. You can’t specify a
different folder location; the copy is automatically placed in the same
folder as the original.
Windows or Mac, the program gives the resized image the same name as the
original but tags the characters “_1” onto the end of the name so that you
don’t overwrite the original. Your e-mail program isn’t started automatically,
but you can take care of that step yourself, creating your message and attach-
ing the picture files just as you do any file that you want to share by e-mail.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of
photos, consider posting your images at an
online photo-album site instead of attaching
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all
enable you to create digital photo albums and
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your
albums and images are deleted if you don’t
order prints or make some other purchase from
the site within a specified amount of time.
Additionally, many free sites enable you to
upload high-resolution files for printing but then
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In
other words, don’t think of album sites as
archival storage solutions.) And here’s another
little bit of fine print to investigate: The mem-
bership agreement at some sites states that you
agree to let the site use your photos, for free, for
any purpose that it sees fit.

Creating an In-Camera Slide Show
Many photo-editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a
DVD player. You can even add music, special transition effects, and the like to
jazz up your presentations.
But if you just want a simple slide show — that is, one that just displays all
the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a com-
puter or any photo software. You can create and run the slide show right on
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in
the next section, you can present your
show to a whole roomful of people.
Follow these steps:
1. Display the Playback menu and
highlight Auto Play, as shown in
Figure 9-15.
2. Press Set.
The images are displayed sequen-
tially on the monitor, with each
image appearing for about four
seconds. After the last image is
displayed, the show automati-
cally begins again.
During auto playback, you can control the display as follows:
 Pause playback. Press the Set button. Press the button again to restart
playback.
 Change the information display style. Press the DISP button. 
(See Chapter 4 for details about the available display styles.)
 Exit Auto playback mode. Press the Menu button.
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Your Rebel XSi/450D is equipped with a video-out port, which is tucked under
the little rubber cover on the left rear side of the camera, as shown in Fig-
ure 9-16. That feature means that you can output your pictures for display 
on a television screen.
277
Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Figure 9-15: Choose Auto Play to set up
automatic playback of all pictures on your
memory card.

278
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-16: You can connect your camera to a television, VCR, or DVD player.
To take advantage of this option, dig through your camera box until you find
the video cable. One end of the cable has a yellow plug; the other end has a
black plug. Then, making sure that the camera is off, plug the black end into
the camera’s video-out port, and plug the yellow end into the video-in port on
your television, as shown in the right side of Figure 9-16. You can also insert
the yellow plug into the video-in port on a VCR or DVD player that’s con-
nected to your TV, as shown in the figure.
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV (or VCR or
DVD) on. At this point, you need to consult your TV/VCR/DVD manual to find
out what channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input
devices like your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control play-
back using the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures on
your camera monitor. (See Chapter 4 for help.) You can also run a slide show
by following the steps outlined in the preceding section.
Note that you may need to adjust one camera setting, Video System, which is
found on Setup Menu 2. You get just two options here: NTSC and PAL. Select
the video mode that’s used by your part of the world. (In the United States,
Canada, and Mexico, NTSC is the standard).

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this
part of the book contains additional tidbits of
information presented in the always popular 
“Top Ten” list format.
Chapter 10 shows you how to do some minor 
picture touchups, such as cropping and adjusting
exposure, by using the free software that shipped
with your camera. Following that, Chapter 11
introduces you to ten camera functions that I 
consider specialty tools — bonus options that,
while not at the top of the list of the features I 
suggest you study, are nonetheless interesting to
explore when you have a free moment or two.

E
very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it hap-
pens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Erase button on your
camera. Many common problems are surprisingly easy to fix using the
tools found in most photo editing programs.
In fact, you can perform many common retouching tasks
using one of the free programs provided with your
camera. Called ZoomBrowser EX in Windows and
ImageBrowser on the Mac, this software offers tools
for removing red-eye, adjusting exposure, tweaking
colors, sharpening focus, and more.
Chapter 8 introduces you to these programs, show-
ing you how to use them to download, view, and
organize your pictures. If you aren’t already familiar
with those basics, you may want to visit that section of
the book first. Then return to this chapter, which lays
out the step-by-step instructions for using the editing tools
to repair and enhance your photos.

282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A couple of other notes before you start:
 If you shot your pictures using the Raw file format, you must process
them using the raw-conversion instructions laid out in Chapter 8 before
you can edit them.
 Although the tools provided in the free software are pretty good, they
don’t allow selective editing. That is, you can’t apply them just to the
part of your photo that needs help. You can’t brighten someone’s face,
for example, without also adjusting the rest of the image. For that kind of
retouching work, you need a more sophisticated photo editor. Chapter 8
offers some recommendations.
 With a couple of exceptions, the figures in this chapter feature the
Windows versions of the Canon software. Although the Mac version
looks different, the actual steps for getting your retouching work done
are the same unless I specifically state otherwise.
 For simplicity’s sake, I refer to ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser
generically in the instructions here as just “the browser.”
 Finally, Canon occasionally posts updates to its software on its Web site
(www.canon.com). So if you’ve owned your camera for a while, check
the Web site to make sure that you’re using the most current versions of
the available programs. This book features version 6.1.1 of
ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser.
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the Rebel XSi/450D.
Typically, the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense:
When little ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen,
creating more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
When red-eye does occur, take these steps to fix the problem:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Again, Chapter 8 shows you how to get your images into the browser
and keep track of your picture files.
After you double-click a thumbnail, the picture opens in its own Viewer
window. Figure 10-1 offers a look at how the window appears in
Windows; Figure 10-2 shows the Mac version.

Figure 10-1: In Windows, click the Edit list above the preview to access retouching tools.
2. Open the Edit drop-down list, as shown in Figures 10-1 and 10-2.
The list appears above the image preview in Windows and below it on 
a Mac.
3. Choose Red Eye Correction from the Edit list.
Your photo appears in the Red Eye Correction retouching window.
Figure 10-3 shows the Windows version; Figure 10-4, the Mac version.
4. Zoom in on your photo so that you can get a good view of the eyes.
• In Windows: Zoom and scroll the display using the controls labeled
in Figure 10-3, which work the same way as they do when you view
your photo in the initial Viewer window. Chapter 8 details all the
controls, but here’s a quick reminder: The fastest way to zoom in
and out is to drag the Zoom slider; to scroll the display, just drag in
the Navigator window, which appears whenever the entire image
isn’t visible at the current preview size. Or click the Hand tool,
labeled in Figure 10-3, and drag in the preview itself.

Figure 10-2: On a Mac, the Edit list appears at the bottom of the window.
• On a Mac: Zoom by choosing a magnification level from the Display
Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 10-4, or by clicking the Zoom
In and Zoom Out buttons. The Mac version of the retouching
window does not sport a Navigator window — instead, you use the
scroll bars to scroll the display.
5. Click the Manual Mode option.
Why not use Auto Mode? Because in that mode, the red-eye correction
tool can sometimes trip up, “correcting” red pixels that aren’t actually 
in the eye. You’re better off using Manual Mode, which enables you to
specify exactly where you want the program to do its retouching work.
6. In Windows, select the Red Eye tool, labeled in Figure 10-5.
The tool is ready to go if it appears highlighted, as in the figure. If not,
click the tool icon. Mac users can ignore this step.

7. Position your mouse cursor over one of the red eyes.
If the program detects fixable red pixels, a green circle appears, as shown
in Figure 10-5. The circle indicates the area that the tool will try to cor-
rect. As you move your cursor around the eye, the circle may change size
as the program searches for pixels that meet its red-eye criteria.
8. Click to initiate the repair.
If you like what you see, move on to the next eye. Or click Undo to get
rid of the correction and then try again.
9. After you finish all eye repairs, click OK.
The Red Eye Correction window closes, and your repaired photo
appears in the Viewer window.
10. Save your picture in the TIFF file format.
The last section of this chapter provides details (and explains why you
should use the TIFF format instead of JPEG).
Figure 10-5: The little green circle indicates the eye area that will be replaced.
Red Eye tool

Like most red-eye removal tools, the Canon version can do a good job in the
right circumstances. But if the eyes are very bright, the tool may not be able
to make the repair. The best solution is to simply paint in the correct eye
colors. For that type of retouching, you need a more capable photo editing
program; one (relatively) inexpensive yet powerful option is Adobe
Photoshop Elements. You can take a look at that program in Chapter 8. 
In addition, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal tools
know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes typically
turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. Again, the only answer is
to make the repair with a paint tool.
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Removing
excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my original
frog scene, shown on the left in Figure 10-6, and its cropped cousin, shown on
the right. In the original image, there’s just too much going on — the eye has
a hard time figuring out what’s important. Eliminating all but a little of the
surrounding foliage returned emphasis to the subject and created a stronger
composition.
Figure 10-6: Cropping creates a better composition, eliminating background clutter.
287
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

288
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You may also want to crop an image so that it fits a specific frame size. As
Chapter 8 explains, the original images from your Canon fit perfectly in 4-x-6-
inch frames, but if you want a 5 x 7, 8 x 10, or other standard print size, you
need to crop your image to those new proportions. (If you don’t, the photo
printer software or retail print lab will crop for you, and the result may not be
the composition that you’d choose.)
Whatever your cropping goal, follow these steps to do it in the Canon
browser software:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Your photo appears all by its lonesome in a new Viewer window.
2. Choose Trim (Windows) or Trimming Image (Mac) from the Edit drop-
down list.
Refer to Figures 10-1 and 10-2, in the preceding section, if you need help
finding the list.
After you choose the command, your image appears in the Trim Image
retouching window. A dotted outline, called a crop box, appears around
your photo, as shown in Figure 10-7. (The figure shows the Windows ver-
sion of the screen; the Mac version contains the same cropping controls.)
3. Click the Advanced Options button to display all the crop-size controls.
Figure 10-7 labels the button and shows the controls that appear when
you click it. (On a Mac, the control panel pops out of the side of the
dialog box instead of appearing within it.)
4. Choose an option from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list.
Your selection determines the proportions of the cropped image. You
can go in three directions:
• Manual: This option enables you to crop the image to any propor-
tions. I chose this setting for my frog photo.
• Maintain Original: If you choose this option, the program restricts
you to cropping to the same proportions as your original. In the
case of your Digital Rebel XSi/450D, that’s 3:2.
• Specific Aspect Ratios: You also can select from six specific aspect
ratios: 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, and 16:9. The first number in the pair
indicates the width and the second indicates the height.

Figure 10-7: You can specify a crop size via the Advanced Options controls.
5. In Windows, make sure that the Trim button is selected, as shown in
Figure 10-7.
It should be already selected unless you used the adjacent controls to
zoom or scroll the preview. Just click the button to select it if needed.
Mac users can skip this step.
6. Adjust the size and position of the crop box as needed.
Use these techniques:
• Move the crop box. Drag inside the box.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
• Resize the crop box. Drag any of the handles — those little squares
around the perimeter of the crop box. I labeled one of the handles
in Figure 10-7.
As you drag the handles, the W and H boxes in the Size of
Trimming Area portion of the dialog box reflect the new dimen-
sions of the crop box, with the measurement shown in pixels. Keep
in mind that pixel count is critical to print quality. Chapters 3 and 9
provide details, but the short story is that you need roughly
200–300 pixels per linear inch of your print. So if you have a fin-
ished print size in mind, monitor the W and H values as you adjust
the crop box size to make sure that you aren’t clipping away too
many pixels.
• Set a specific crop size. You also can enter specific pixel dimensions
in the W and H boxes. The crop box automatically adjusts to the
dimensions you enter.
Using the third option is the easiest way to crop your photo to a size
that doesn’t mesh with any of the specific aspect ratio choices. Say that
you want to produce a 5-x-7-inch print from your cropped photo, and
you want an image resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Just multiply the
print dimensions by the desired resolution and then enter those values
into the W and H boxes. For the 5 x 7 at 300 ppi example, the W and H
values are 1500 and 2100, respectively. If the resulting crop boundary
encompasses too much or too little of your photo, just keep adjusting
the W and H values, making sure to always keep the two at the same pro-
portions you originally entered.
7. Turn on the Use the Rule of Thirds gridlines (optional).
A classic composition rule is to imagine that your image is divided into
thirds vertically and horizontally and then position the subject at a spot
where two dividing lines intersect.
To help you visualize that concept, the Trim box can display those hori-
zontal and vertical grid lines as shown in Figure 10-8. Just click the Use
the Rule of Thirds check box to toggle the grid on and off.
8. When you’re happy with the crop box, click the Trim Image button.
The cropped photo appears in the preview. If you aren’t happy with the
results, click the Undo button and try again.
9. Click OK to close the retouching window.
10. Choose File➪Save As to save your cropped image.
The last section of this chapter has details.

Figure 10-8: The Rule of Thirds gridlines offer a compositional guide.
Adjusting Color Saturation
Saturation refers to the intensity and purity of color. A fully saturated color
contains no black, white, or gray. In other words, saturated colors are deep,
rich, and bold.
I find that the colors produced by the Rebel XSi/450D are already pretty
highly saturated, but on occasion, an image can benefit from a little satura-
tion bump in the digital darkroom. Figure 10-9 offers an example. I was drawn
to this scene by the mix of colors, and the original photo, shown on the left in
the figure, seemed a little lackluster in that regard. So I increased the satura-
tion ever so slightly to produce the image shown on the right.
Be careful about increasing saturation too much, however. Doing so actually
can destroy picture detail as areas that previously contained a range of satu-
ration levels all shift to the fully saturated state. In fact, you can often reveal
detail by lowering saturation a little in your photo editor. For example, com-
pare the original (left) and slightly desaturated (right) versions of the image
in Figure 10-10. Notice that the subtle gradations of color in the flower petals
become apparent only after saturation is reduced.

Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 10-9: I slightly increased saturation to make the colors pop a little more.
Whichever direction you want to go, take these steps to adjust saturation of
your image:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
Your photo opens inside its own Viewer window.
2. Click the Edit drop-down list.
The list appears above the image preview in Windows; it appears 
below the preview on a Mac. (Refer to Figures 10-1 and 10-2 for the 
exact locations.)
3. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the list.
Your image appears in the Color/Brightness Adjustment retouching
window. The window contents vary depending whether you’re using the
Windows or Mac version of the program; Figures 10-11 and 10-12 show
you both versions.
Original

Figure 10-10: Desaturating colors slightly can sometimes reveal hidden details.
4. Set the Retouching mode to Color Adjustment.
• In Windows: Select Color Adjustment from the drop-down list at the
top of the retouching window, as shown in Figure 10-11. After you
do so, the window offers three sliders: Brightness, Saturation, and
Contrast.
• On a Mac: Click the Color Adjustment button. The Mac version of
the tool offers just a Saturation and Brightness slider. (Don’t fret;
you don’t want to use that Contrast slider anyway, nor its sibling,
Brightness. More on that topic a bit later.)
5. Drag the Saturation slider to adjust the image as desired.
Again, I caution you against raising the Saturation value too much; you
can easily blow out subtle picture details.
6. Click OK to apply the change and close the retouching window.
7. Save the edited image, following the steps provided at the end of this
chapter.

And now for the promised note about the Brightness and Contrast controls:
Despite what their names may lead you to believe, these tools aren’t the best
options for adjusting image exposure and contrast. You can get much better
results by using the Level Adjustment and Tone Curve Adjustment tools, both
explained later in this chapter.
Tweaking Color Balance
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s white balance and Picture Style
controls to manipulate the colors in your pictures. If you can’t get the results
you want by using those features, you may be able to do the job using the
RGB Adjustment filter offered by the Canon browser. In Figure 10-13, for
example, I used the filter to tone down the amount of blue in the image and
bring out the warm yellow tones of the building instead.
Figure 10-13: I warmed colors to emphasize the buildings rather than the sky.

Follow these steps to use the filter:
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
You do this by just double-clicking the image thumbnail in the main
browser window.
2. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list.
Look for the list above the image preview if you’re a Windows user; on a
Mac, the list is below the preview. After you choose the command, your
photo appears in a retouching window. Figure 10-14 shows you both the
Windows and Mac versions of the window.
Figure 10-14: Select RGB Adjustment to tweak color balance.

3. Select RGB Adjustment as the edit mode.
In Windows, select that option from the drop-down list at the top of the
window, as shown in the top image in Figure 10-14. On a Mac, just click
the RGB Adjustment button, as shown in the lower image.
Either way, you gain access to three sliders: Red, Green, and Blue.
4. Drag the sliders to adjust image colors.
The filter is based on three color pairs: red-cyan; green-magenta; and
blue-yellow. (Those six colors happen to be the primary and secondary
colors of the RGB color world, which is the one in which all digital
images reside.) As you move the sliders, you affect both the primary
color and its secondary opposite, as follows:
• Red slider: As you drag the slider to the right, you increase red and
decrease cyan. Drag the slider to the left to diminish reds and
embolden cyans.
• Green slider: Drag this slider to the right to add green and reduce
magenta. Drag to the left to produce the opposite result.
• Blue slider: Dragging this slider to the right increases the amount of
blue and reduces the amount of yellow. Go the other direction to
increase yellow and tone down blues.
In imaging lingo, tools of this type are known as color balancing filters
because they shift the balance between the two opposite colors.
I used the slider settings shown in the figure for my example photo.
5. When you’re happy with the image colors, click OK to close the
retouching window.
6. Save your work according to the steps in the last section of this chapter.
Adjusting Exposure
Getting exposure just right is one of the trickiest aspects of photography.
Fortunately, the Canon browser software gives you three tools for tweaking
exposure. The next two sections introduce you to the two most capable of
those tools, the Level Adjustment filter and the Tone Curve Adjustment filter.
(The latter, by the way, is a professional-grade tool usually found only in
expensive programs like Photoshop.)
What about the exposure options that appear when you open the Color
Adjustment filter (discussed earlier and shown in Figures 10-11 and 10-12)? In
Windows, the filter offers a Brightness and Contrast slider; on a Mac, you get
just the Brightness slider. You might naturally gravitate toward using those
two sliders for correcting exposure. But doing so isn’t a good idea.
297
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The problem is that both sliders affect all pixels in your image. You can’t
brighten just the shadows in your image, for example, without also brighten-
ing the midtones (areas of medium brightness) and highlights. Ditto for the
contrast adjustment. For that reason, you rarely can get good results. So 
do yourself a favor and stick with the Level Adjustment or Tone Curve
Adjustment tools. They’re a little more intimidating at first than using the
simple Brightness and Contrast sliders, but they’re actually pretty easy to
use once you figure out what’s what — which is what the next two sections
help you do.
Three-point exposure control with 
the Level Adjustment filter
With a levels filter, found in many photo programs, you can adjust your pic-
ture’s shadows, midtones, and highlights individually. Figure 10-15 shows you
the Canon browser’s version of this filter as it appears in Windows; the Mac
version contains the same options, albeit in a slightly different layout.
Figure 10-15: The Level Adjustment tool isn’t nearly as difficult to use as it appears.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Wow, that looks way too complicated for
me.” Trust me, though, that this filter is actually pretty easy to use. First,
ignore everything but the graph in the middle of the box, known as a his-
togram, and the three sliders underneath, labeled Shadows, Midtones, and
Highlights in Figure 10-16. See? Easier already.
The histogram works just like
the Brightness histogram
that you can display while
reviewing your images on
your camera monitor, a topic
that I discuss in Chapter 4. To
recap, the horizontal axis of
the graph represents the pos-
sible brightness values in an
image, ranging from black on
the left side to white on the
right. The vertical axis shows
you how many pixels fall at a
particular brightness value. So if you have a tall spike, you have lots of pixels
at that brightness value. To adjust exposure, you just drag the three sliders
underneath the histogram, depending on whether you want to shift shadows,
midtones, or highlights. 
Take these steps to try it out:
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail to
open it in a new Viewer window.
2. Open the Level Adjustment retouching window.
• In Windows: Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit
drop-down list, found above the image preview. Then select Level
Adjustment from the drop-down list at the top of the retouching
window, as shown in Figure 10-15.
• On a Mac: Choose Level Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list,
which appears underneath the image preview. (Again, the Mac ver-
sion of the retouching window looks a little different from the one
in Figure 10-15, but the critical controls are the same.)
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
On a Mac, the option is unlabeled; it’s the pop-up list above the histogram. 
RGB should already be selected, but check just to be sure. (The other
options enable you to adjust brightness values of the red, green, and
blue color components of the image, which is a color-balancing trick
used by some advanced photo editing types.)

three sliders.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
4. Drag the sliders underneath the histogram to adjust exposure.
Use the sliders as follows:
• To darken shadows: Drag the Shadows slider to the right.
• To adjust midtones: Drag the middle slider to the right to darken
midtones; drag it to the left to brighten them.
• To brighten highlights: Drag the Highlights slider to the left.
Note that as you drag the Shadows or Highlights slider, the Midtones
slider also moves in tandem. So you may need to readjust that slider
after you set the other two.
You can compare your original image with the adjusted one by toggling
the dialog box preview on and off. In Windows, click the Show Original
Image box to turn the preview off; click again to return to the preview.
On a Mac, click the Preview box instead.
I dragged the sliders to the positions shown in Figure 10-17 to produce
the results you see in the preview.
5. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format.
See the last section of this chapter to find out how.
Figure 10-17: I brightened highlights and midtones but darkened shadows slightly.

Gaining more control with the 
Tone Curve Adjustment filter
Easily the most sophisticated of the browser’s retouching tools, the Tone
Curve Adjustment filter, often referred to generically as simply a curves filter,
gives you even greater exposure-adjustment control. Whereas a levels filter
offers three control points — you can manipulate shadows, midtones, and
highlights — a curves filter enables you to manipulate specific values along
the entire brightness spectrum.
Figure 10-18 offers a look at the Windows version of the Tone Curve
Adjustment retouching window. The Mac version is slightly different in
appearance, but it contains the same main components.
Again, the controls inside the window seem mighty perplexing at first. But
here’s all you need to know to take advantage of the filter:
 See that line that runs diagonally through the white grid? That’s just
another representation of the possible brightness values in a digital
image. Black falls at the lower end of the line; white, at the top. (The
shaded bars that run alongside the left and lower edges of the grid remind
you of that orientation.) Medium brightness falls dead center on the line.
Figure 10-18: With the Tone Curve Adjustment filter, you get even greater exposure control.
301
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 To adjust exposure, click and drag at the spot on the line that corre-
sponds to the brightness value you want to change. Drag up to brighten
the image; drag down to darken it. For example, in Figure 10-19, I dragged
the center of the line up. The resulting curve — tone curve, in imaging
parlance — produced the exposure change shown in the preview.
 After a drag, a control point appears at the spot on the line you dragged
to anchor that part of the tone curve, as shown in Figure 10-19.
 You can bend the tone curve as much as you want, in any direction you
want. Just keep clicking and dragging to add control points. But be care-
ful — extreme curves or curves with tons of points can produce really
ugly results and odd breaks in color and brightness. I usually aim for a
gentle curve that has no more than six points, including the ones that
are provided automatically at the black and white ends of the curve.
 To increase contrast, create an s-shaped curve; to decrease contrast,
create a reverse-s shape. I used the gentle s-shaped curve shown in
Figure 10-20 to produce the finished mushroom photo that you see in
the preview. The curve resulted in a slight bump in exposure to medium
and medium bright pixels and a slight darkening of medium dark and
dark pixels. The white and black areas of the image remain unchanged.
Figure 10-19: Drag upward to brighten the image; drag down to darken it.
Control point Tone curve

Figure 10-20: An s-shaped curve boosts contrast.
The best way to really understand this filter is to try it for yourself. So take
these steps:
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
You know the drill: Just double-click the thumbnail in the main browser
window. (See Chapter 8 if you need help.)
2. Open the Tone Curve Adjustment retouching window.
• In Windows: Click the Edit drop-down list at the top of the browser
window and choose Adjust Color/Brightness. When the retouching
window appears, select Tone Curve Adjustment from the drop-
down list at the top.
• On a Mac: Click the Edit drop-down list underneath the image pre-
view and choose Tone Curve Adjustment to open the retouching
window.
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
On a Mac, the option is the unlabeled pop-up list just above the grid.
303
Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks

304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As with the Level Adjustment filter, you can also manipulate the bright-
ness values of the red, green, and blue color components of the image
independently through this filter. But if you do, you alter the image
colors instead of making a pure exposure change. Most people find using
a regular color-balancing tool easier; see the earlier section “Tweaking
Color Balance” for a look at that option.
4. Bend the tone curve by adding and dragging control points.
See the preceding list for details on this step. If you need to delete a
point, click it to select it and then press Delete. (The selected control
point appears black.)
If your image doesn’t appear to change in the preview, check the status
of the box labeled Show Original Image. When the box is selected, the
window displays your photo in its original state. Deselect the box to
turn the dialog box preview on.
5. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the retouching window.
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format, following the steps at the end
of this chapter. 
Sharpening Focus (Sort Of)
Have you ever seen one of those spy-movie thrillers where the good guys
capture a photo of the villain’s face — only the picture is so blurry that it
could just as easily be a picture of pudding? The heroes ask the photo-lab
experts to “enhance” the picture, and within seconds, it’s transformed into an
image so clear you can make out individual hairs in the villain’s mustache.
It is with heavy heart that I tell you that this kind of image rescue is pure
Hollywood fantasy. You simply can’t take a blurry image and turn it into a
sharply focused photo, even with the most sophisticated photo software on
the market.
There is, however, a digital process called sharpening that can slightly
enhance the apparent focus of pictures that are slightly blurry, as illustrated
by the before and after images in Figure 10-21. Notice that I say “apparent”
focus: Sharpening doesn’t really adjust focus but instead creates the illusion
of sharper focus by increasing contrast in a special way.
Here’s how it works: Wherever pixels of different colors come together, the
sharpening process boosts contrast along the border between them. The
light side of the border gets lighter; the dark side gets darker. Photography
experts refer to those light and dark strips as sharpening halos. You can get a
close-up look at the halos in the right, sharpened example in Figure 10-22,
which shows a tiny portion of the pencil image from Figure 10-21. Notice that
in the sharpened example, the yellow side of the boundary between the pen-
cils received a light halo, while the blue side received a dark halo.

Figure 10-21: A slightly blurry image (left) can benefit from a sharpening filter (right).
Figure 10-22: Sharpening adds light and dark halos along color boundaries.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A little sharpening can go a long way toward improving a slightly soft image.
But too much sharpening does more damage than good. The halos become
so strong that they’re clearly visible, and the image takes on a sandpaper-like
texture. And again, no amount of sharpening can repair a truly out-of-focus
image, so all you do when you crank up sharpening is make matters worse.
Both the Windows and Mac versions of the Canon browser software offer a
simple Sharpening tool, shown in its Mac incarnation in Figure 10-23. To use
this tool, just follow the usual steps: Double-click the image thumbnail to open
it in its own Viewer window and then choose Sharpness from the Edit drop-
down list. (See Figures 10-1 and 10-2 if you have trouble finding the list.) Drag
the slider to the right to add sharpening and then click OK to finish the job.
Windows users, however, have the option of using a more flexible sharpening
tool, called an Unsharp Mask filter. To switch to this filter, just click the
Unsharp Mask tab at the top of the Sharpness retouching window, as shown
in Figure 10-24.
The three sliders provided for the Unsharp Mask filter enable you to control
where and how the sharpening halos are applied, as follows:
 Amount: This slider adjusts the intensity of the sharpening halos.
 Radius: This slider adjusts the width of the halos. Don’t go too high, or
the sharpening halos will become very noticeable.
 Threshold: With this slider, you can limit the sharpening effect just to
high-contrast color boundaries. Try raising the value a few notches up
from 0 when sharpening portraits to sharpen the image without adding
unwanted texture to the skin. I also used this technique to keep the sur-
face of the pencils smooth in my example photo while sharpening the
edges between them.
Figure 10-23: The Mac version of the browser offers only a simple sharpening slider.

Figure 10-24: The Unsharp Mask filter provides three levels of sharpening control.
Whichever sharpening filter you use, don’t forget to save the altered image in
the TIFF file format. The last section of this chapter explains this critical part
of the retouching process.
Shifting to AutoPilot
You may have noticed as you explored the Edit drop-down list an option
called Auto Adjustment. If you select this option, the program opens your
image in a retouching window, as usual. Figure 10-25 shows the Windows
flavor of the window; the Mac version is virtually identical. After the window
opens, you simply click the Auto Adjust Image button and sit back and wait.
The program analyzes your image and then makes whatever changes it
deems necessary. You can compare the “before” and “after” views of your
photo by clicking the Show Original Image box on and off.
As a rule, I don’t recommend this type of automatic image correction tool
because it so often doesn’t produce results as good as what you can do by
using the manual filter controls. Sometimes, the auto filters even muck up
color and exposure more than they “correct” them. And who’s to say that the
program won’t see as a flaw some aspect of the picture that you actually like?

Figure 10-25: Click Auto Adjust Image to see what changes the program thinks are needed.
That said, if you aren’t working on important images or you just don’t have
the time or interest in using the more sophisticated tools, go ahead and give
that Auto Adjust Image button a click. If you don’t like what you see, click the
Cancel button and do the job yourself, using the tricks laid out elsewhere in
this chapter.
Adding Text
You know that saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words?” Well, you can up
that count even more by adding text to your photo. You can do so as follows:
1. Open your photo in its own Viewer window by double-clicking the
image thumbnail in the main browser window.
2. Choose Insert Text from the Edit drop-down list.
Look for the list at the top of the window if you use the Windows version
of the program and at the bottom if you’re a Mac user. Either way, you see
your photo in the Insert Text retouching window. Figure 10-26 gives you a
look at the Windows version of the window. (Again, the Mac version is 
virtually identical except for sporting different controls for zooming and

scrolling the display. See the first section of this chapter for help with
those controls.)
3. Click in the preview at the spot you want to add the text.
(In Windows, be sure that the Text tool, located under the preview, next
to the Zoom tools, is selected before you click.) After you click, a text
box appears, as shown in the figure. At any time, you can resize the box
as needed by dragging the little boxes that appear around its perimeter.
To move the box (and any text inside), just drag inside the box.
4. Type your text.
The text appears both in the image preview and in the Text area on the
right side of the window.
If you want to add the date and time you shot the picture, don’t waste
time typing that information. Instead, just click the Import Shooting
Date/Time, and the program finds the data in the image file and adds it
to the text box for you. Similarly, if you added comment text when orga-
nizing your pictures in the main browser, clicking the Import Comment
button enters that text for you. (You can add comments via the
Comment pane that appears when you browse images in Preview dis-
play mode. Chapter 8 explains the basics of browsing images.)

5. Use the controls at the top of the dialog box to set the type 
characteristics.
You can specify a font (type design), size, and color and add bold, 
underline, or italic formatting.
The Antialias option smoothes the jagged edges that can occur when 
letters contain diagonal or curved lines. As a rule, keeping this option
enabled is a good idea.
6. When you finish creating your text, click OK.
The retouching window closes.
7. Save your edited file as outlined in the next section.
Saving Your Edited Files
Whatever retouching task you do, the last step is to save your edited picture
file. After you click OK to close the retouching window and return to the
Viewer window, choose the Save As command from the File menu. You then
see the standard Windows or Mac file-saving dialog box that appears any
time you save any type of file. 
You need to take two critical steps inside the dialog box:
 Select TIFF as the file type. TIFF is an image file format that produces
the best picture quality for saved images.
Do not use JPEG as the file type. Every time you edit and save a picture in
the JPEG format, you damage the picture quality slightly because of the
lossy compression that is applied in that format. Chapter 3 has details on
this issue. Should you need a JPEG version of your edited photo for
online use, save it first as a TIFF file and then follow the steps provided in
Chapter 9 to create a Web-sized copy of the picture in the JPEG format.
 Type a name for the picture in the File Name box (Windows) or the
Save As box (Mac). The filename of the original image appears automati-
cally in the box. You don’t have to change the filename — you won’t
overwrite the original file when you save because you aren’t saving it in
the JPEG format (and you can’t save in the Raw format). But I like to add
a tag to the filename that indicates the status of the image — for exam-
ple, IMG_7582 retouched, or PencilsSharpened, or the like.
After taking care of those two pieces of business, specify where you want to
store the file as you usually do. Then click the Save button to save the file
and close the dialog box.

C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of
one of those late-night infomercial offers — the part
where the host exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the cate-
gory of “interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of
features that drive people to choose one camera
over another, and they may come in handy only for
certain users, on certain occasions. Still, they’re
included at no extra charge with your Canon pur-
chase, so check ’em out when you have a few spare
moments. Who knows; you may discover that one of
these bonus features is actually a hidden gem that pro-
vides just the solution you need for one of your photog-
raphy problems.
Many of the features I discuss here involve Custom Functions, a
group of 13 advanced options that you access via Setup Menu 3. If you’re not
familiar with how to navigate the Custom Functions, the next section spells
things out.

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Changing the Function of the Set Button
Normally, the Set button serves two functions: When a menu is displayed,
you press the button to select menu options. And if you enable Live View
shooting, a feature introduced in Chapter 4, you press Set to switch from
normal shooting to Live View mode.
To make the Set button more helpful when Live View is not enabled, you can
change the function of the button so that pressing it displays the Quality
options or the Flash Exposure Compensation options. Doing so enables you
to access those settings more quickly than by using the menus.
You also can assign the Set button the same function as the Menu button, in
which case you can use either button to display the menus. Or you can tell
the camera that you want to use the Set button to toggle the monitor on and
off instead of using the DISP for that operation. I don’t think either of these
options is terribly useful, but you be the judge.
To customize the button, take these steps:
1. Set your camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP).
You can’t adjust the performance of the Set button in the fully automatic
exposure modes. Nor does the button perform whatever alternative
function you may assign when the camera is set to those modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 3 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-1.
This menu item enables you to customize 13 aspects of the camera’s
performance.
Figure 11-1: The Custom Function menu item provides access to 13 customization options.
Custom Function category
Custom Function number

3. Press Set.
The screen should look something like the one on the right in Figure 11-1,
at least along the bottom of the screen. What appears in the rest of the
screen depends on which Custom Function is currently selected.
The Custom Functions are grouped into four categories. The category
number and name appear in the top-left corner of the screen; the number
of the selected function appears in the top-right corner and is marked
with a bar at the bottom of the screen. And the blue text indicates the cur-
rent setting of the selected Custom Function. You also can see the number
of the option that’s currently selected at the bottom of the screen, under-
neath the Custom Function number. A zero represents the default setting.
4. If needed, press the right or left
cross key to display Custom
Function 11.
Now you should see the options
shown on the right in Figure 11-1. 
5. Press the Set button.
Now the list of options for
Custom Function 11 becomes
accessible, and a yellow highlight
box appears around one of the
options, as shown in Figure 11-2.
6. Press the up or down cross keys
to highlight your choice.
I highlighted the Flash Exposure Compensation option in Figure 11-2.
7. Press the Set button.
Now whenever you shoot in the advanced exposure modes and press Set
while no menus are displayed, the button takes on the function you just
assigned to it. To go back to the default setting, repeat these steps and select
option 0 (Normal: disabled) in Step 6.
Again, though, your custom Set button is available only when Live View is
disabled (through Setup Menu 2) and only when you set the Mode dial to one
of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). In Live View mode,
the button always toggles the Live View preview on and off. And in the other
exposure modes, the button has no function other than selecting items from
menus.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Customizing Exposure and Focus Lock Options
By default, pressing your shutter button halfway establishes and locks focus
when you use autofocusing. When you shoot in the advanced autoexposure
modes, you also can lock in the exposure settings the camera selects by press-
ing and holding the AE (autoexposure) Lock button, labeled in Figure 11-3.
You can customize the locking behaviors of the two buttons via Custom
Function 10. Here’s how:
1. Set the Mode dial to an
advanced exposure setting.
As with all Custom Functions,
you can take advantage of this
option only in the P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP exposure mode.
Additionally, the locking setup
you specify applies only to
those modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 3, high-
light Custom Functions, and
press Set.
3. Select Custom Function 10.
Press the right or left cross key
to scroll through the 13 Custom
Functions.
4. Press Set to activate the list
of settings, as shown in
Figure 11-4.
A highlight box appears, as
shown in the figure. The option
that appears in blue text is the
current setting; option number 0
represents the default setting.
5. Press the up and down cross
keys to highlight the option you
want to use.
You have the following four
choices. (The first part of the
setting name indicates what
happens with a half-press of
AE Lock button

button locks the autoexposure setting.

the shutter button; the second part indicates the function of the AE Lock
button.)
• AF/AE Lock: This is the default setting. Pressing the shutter button
halfway establishes and locks autofocus; pressing the AE Lock
button locks autoexposure.
• AE Lock/AF: With this option, pressing the shutter button halfway
locks autoexposure instead of focus. To focus, you instead press
the AE Lock button. In other words, this mode is the exact oppo-
site of the default setup.
• AF/AF Lock, no AE Lock: This mode is designed to prevent focusing
mishaps when you use AI Servo autofocusing, explained in Chapter
6. Here’s the deal: In the AI Servo mode, the autofocus motor con-
tinually adjusts focus from the time you press the shutter button
halfway until the time you actually take the image. This feature
helps you keep moving objects sharply focused. But if something
moves in front of your subject, the camera may mistakenly focus
on that object, which may leave your subject blurry.
To cope with that possibility, this locking option enables you to ini-
tiate autofocusing as usual, by pressing the shutter button halfway.
But at any time before you take the picture, you can press the AE
Lock button to temporarily stop the autofocusing motor from
adjusting focus if an intruder does move into the frame. When you
release the button, the autofocusing mechanism starts up again.
If you choose this option, exposure is set when you press the shut-
ter button all the way. You can’t lock autoexposure.
• AE/AF, no AE Lock: Similar to the preceding mode, this one also is
designed to help you capture moving subjects in the AI Servo
mode. Pressing the shutter button halfway initiates autoexposure
metering, which is adjusted continuously as needed until the time
you snap the picture. Pressing the AE Lock button starts the auto-
focusing servo system; releasing the button stops it. You cannot
lock autoexposure in this mode.
6. Press the Set button to finalize your choice.
Now when you shoot in an advanced exposure mode, the camera locks
focus and exposure according to the option you selected. In the fully
automatic modes, the settings have no effect; a half-press of the shutter
button still locks focus, and you can’t lock autoexposure.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Disabling the AF-Assist Beam
In dim lighting, your camera may emit an AF (autofocus)-assist beam from the
built-in flash when you press the shutter button halfway — assuming that the
flash unit is open, of course. This pulse of light helps the camera “see” its
target better, improving the performance of the autofocusing system.
If you’re shooting in a situation where the AF-assist beam may be distracting
to your subject or to others in the room, you can disable it. Take these steps
to control this aspect of your camera:
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
As with the other customization options discussed in preceding sec-
tions, this one is available only in these advanced exposure modes.
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
You’re taken to the main launching pad for adjusting all the Custom
Functions.
3. Press the right or left cross key as needed to select Custom Function 7.
4. Press the Set button.
Now the options shown in
Figure 11-5 become accessible.
5. Press the up or down cross key
to highlight your desired setting.
Setting 1 disables the AF-assist
beam of both the built-in flash
and compatible Canon EX-series
Speedlite external flash units.
Setting 2 disables the beam of the
built-in flash while allowing the
beam of a compatible EX-series
Speedlite to function normally.
6. Press the Set button.
Your chosen setting affects all the advanced exposure modes. In fully
automatic modes, the autofocus assist beam continues to light from the
built-in flash when the camera deems it necessary.
Without the aid of the assist beam, the camera may have trouble autofocusing
in dim lighting. The easiest solution is to simply focus manually; Chapter 1
shows you how.
Figure 11-5: You can disable the autofocus-
assist beam.

Enabling Mirror Lockup
One of the components involved in the optical system of an SLR camera is a
tiny mirror that moves when you press the shutter button. The small vibra-
tion caused by the movement of the mirror can result in slight blurring of the
image when you use a very slow shutter speed, shoot with a long telephoto
lens, or take extreme close-up shots. To eliminate the possibility, your
camera offers a feature called mirror lockup. When you enable this feature,
the mirror movement is completed well before the shot is recorded, thus pre-
venting any camera shake.
To try out this feature, take these
steps:
1. Set the Mode dial to an
advanced exposure mode.
Mirror lockup isn’t available in
the fully automatic exposure
modes. So set that dial to P, Tv,
Av, M, or A-DEP.
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight
Custom Functions, and press Set.
3. Press the right or left cross key
to scroll to Custom Function 9.
4. Press Set to access the options
shown in Figure 11-6.
5. Press the up or down cross key to highlight the Enable option, as
shown in the figure.
6. Press the Set button.
After you enable mirror lockup, you take a slightly different approach to
picture-taking than usual. Use this technique:
1. Frame your shot.
2. If using autofocus, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus.
Or, if you prefer manual focusing, twist the focusing ring as needed to
focus the image.
3. Press the shutter button all the way down to lock up the mirror.
At this point, you can no longer see anything through the viewfinder.
Don’t panic — that’s normal. The mirror’s function is to enable you to
see in the viewfinder the scene that the lens will capture, and mirror
lockup prevents it from serving that purpose.
317

Figure 11-6: Mirror lockup prevents camera
shake caused by the movement of the optical
system’s mirror. 

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
4. Press the shutter button all the way again.
The camera then takes the picture. 
Using a tripod or other support is critical to getting a shake-free shot in situa-
tions that call for mirror lockup. For even more protection, set your camera
to the 2-second self-timer mode, introduced in Chapter 2, and take your
hands completely off the camera after you press the shutter button in Step 3.
The picture is taken two seconds after the mirror lockup occurs.
Adding Cleaning Instructions to Images
You’ve no doubt noticed that your camera displays a message that says
“Sensor Cleaning” every time you turn the camera off. And when you turn the
camera on, a little “cleaning” icon flickers in the lower-right corner of the
Camera Settings display. These alerts tell you that the camera is performing a
self-maintenance step that is designed to remove from the sensor any dust
particles that may have made their way into the camera interior.
If you don’t see these alerts, open Setup Menu 2, choose the Sensor Cleaning
option, and then press Set. Next, set the Auto Cleaning option to Enable.
(There’s really no reason to disable this feature, although Canon gives you
the choice to do so.)
The automated sensor cleaning normally is all that’s necessary to keep the
sensor dust-free. But if you notice that small spots are appearing consistently
on your images, you may need to step in and take action on your own.
The best solution, of course, is to take your camera to a good repair shop
and have the sensor professionally cleaned. I do not recommend that you
take on this job yourself; it’s a delicate procedure, and you can easily ruin
your camera.
Until you can have the camera cleaned, however, you can use a feature on
Shooting Menu 2 to create a custom dust-removal filter that you can apply in
Digital Photo Professional, which is one of the free programs that ships with
your camera.
The first step in creating the filter is to record a data file that maps the loca-
tion of the dust spots on the sensor. To do this, you need a white piece of
paper or other white surface and a lens that can achieve a focal length of
55mm or greater. (The kit lens on the Rebel XSi/450D qualifies.) Then take
these steps:

1. Set the lens focal length at 55mm or longer.
If you own the kit lens, just zoom in as far as possible, which sets the
focal length at 55mm.
2. Switch the camera to manual focusing.
On the kit lens, just move the focus switch on the lens from AF to MF.
3. Set focus at infinity.
Some lenses have a marking that indicates the infinity position — the
symbol looks like a number 8 lying on its side. If your lens doesn’t have
the marking, hold the camera so that the lens is facing you and then turn
the lens focusing ring clockwise until it stops. 
4. Set the camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M,
or A-DEP).
You can create the dust data file only in these modes.
5. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Dust Delete Data, as shown on
the left in Figure 11-7.
Figure 11-7: You can record dust-removal data that can be read by Digital Photo Professional.
6. Press the Set button.
Now you see the Dust Delete Data message shown on the right in
Figure 11-7.
7. Press the right cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.
The camera performs its normal automatic sensor-cleaning ritual, which
takes a second or two. Then you see the instruction screen shown on
the left in Figure 11-8.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-8: The dust delete data is recorded when you press the shutter button all the way.
8. Position the camera so that it’s about 8–12 inches from your white
card or piece of paper.
Your card or paper needs to be large enough to completely fill the
viewfinder at this distance.
9. Press the shutter button all the way to record the dust delete data.
No picture is taken; the camera just records the dust-delete data in its
internal memory. If the process was successful, you see the congratula-
tory message shown on the right in Figure 11-8.
If the camera tells you that it couldn’t record the data, the lighting condi-
tions are likely to blame. Make sure that the lighting is even across the
entire surface of your white card or paper and that the paper is suffi-
ciently illuminated and then try again.
10. Press the Set button.
The date that you created the dust-delete data now appears on the ini-
tial Dust Delete Data screen (shown on the right in Figure 11-7).
After you create your dust-delete data file, the camera attaches the data to
every subsequent image, regardless of whether you shoot in the fully auto-
matic or advanced exposure modes. 
To clean a photo, open it in Digital Photo Professional and choose Start
Stamp Tool from the Tools menu. Your photo then appears in an editing
window; click the Apply Dust Delete Data button to start the automated dust-
busting feature. The program’s manual and Help system offer details about
this process; look for the Help entry related to using the Copy Stamp tool.

Turning Off the Camera Settings Screen
When you turn on your camera, the monitor automatically turns on and dis-
plays the Camera Settings screen. At least, it does if you stick with the default
setting selected for Custom Function 12, which bears the lengthy name of
LCD Display When Power On.
You can prevent the monitor from displaying the screen every time you power
up the camera if you choose. What’s the point? Well, the monitor is one of the
biggest drains on the camera battery, so limiting it to displaying information
only when you need it can extend the time between battery charges.
As with other Custom Functions, this option works only when the camera is
set to one of the advanced exposure modes — in other modes, the screen
still appears automatically. Still, any battery savings can be helpful when
you’re running low on juice.
To take advantage of this feature, take these steps:
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
3. Use the cross keys to select
Custom Function 12 and then
press Set.
You see the screen shown in
Figure 11-9.
4. Press the up or down cross key
to highlight Retain Power Off
Status.
5. Press Set.
6. Press the shutter button halfway
to turn the monitor off.
Now when you turn the camera
off and then on again, the moni-
tor will not automatically power
up and display the Camera Settings screen — as long as the Mode dial is
set to an advanced shooting mode, that is. Nor will the screen appear
when you press the shutter button halfway, as it normally does.
To view the screen, press the DISP button; press the button again to
return to monitor-off status.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Creating Desktop Wallpaper
You can quickly turn an image on your camera memory card into desktop
wallpaper — a background image that appears on your monitor, behind any
icons or program windows. For example, I plastered my Windows desktop
with a water lily image, as shown in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-10: You can use a favorite image as your monitor background.
To decorate your monitor, follow these steps:
1. Connect the camera to the computer, following the instructions in
Chapter 8.
After a short time, the Direct Transfer screen appears on the camera
monitor, as shown in Figure 11-11.
2. Highlight Wallpaper and then press the Set button.
The camera monitor displays your most recent image.

3. Press the right or left cross key
to scroll to the image you want
to use as wallpaper.
4. Press the Set button to start the
transfer.
The camera downloads the image
to your hard drive and then saves
a copy of it in the correct format
to use for wallpaper. The wall-
paper image then appears on the
computer desktop. 
If you prefer, you also can turn an
image that’s already on your com-
puter’s hard drive into wallpaper by using Canon ZoomBrowser EX
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). See the Help system in those programs
for how-tos. Also note that because the images your Canon creates have an
aspect ratio of 3:2, they won’t fully cover the desktop of most monitors,
which typically have an aspect ratio of either 4:3 or 16:9. If you want the
image to fully fill the screen, you must edit it to the correct proportions
and then use the Windows or Mac display customization tools to turn the
edited file into wallpaper. Chapter 10 shows you how to crop to specific
proportions.
Adding Original Decision Data
Now that photo editing has gone main-
stream, determining whether a digital
photo has been altered from its origi-
nal state is difficult. However, through
Custom Function 13, you now have a
way to prove that a picture file hasn’t
been edited.
If you enable this Custom Function,
as shown in Figure 11-12, the camera
adds to the image file a tag that veri-
fies the photo as original. There’s a
catch, though: In order to make use of
that tag when the file is opened on
your computer, you must use a special
piece of software called the Original
Data Decision Security Kit OSK-E3. You can buy that product for about $650.
If you want to know more about the whole issue, visit the Canon Web site.

Creating Your Very Own Camera Menu
Canon does a good job of making it easy to change the most commonly used
camera settings. You can access many critical options by pressing the but-
tons on the camera body, and others require only a quick trip to the camera
menus.
To make things even simpler for you,
the Rebel XSi/450D enables you to
create your own, custom menu con-
taining up to six items from the
camera’s other six menus. For exam-
ple, I created a custom menu that con-
tains the options shown in Figure
11-13. (The last item, My Menu
Settings, is always on the menu; more
about that later.) Logically enough,
the custom menu goes by the name
My Menu and is represented by the
green star icon, as shown in the figure. 
To create your menu, take these steps:
1. Set the camera Mode dial to an
advanced exposure mode.
Sadly, you can create and order from your custom menu only in P, Tv, Av,
M, and A-DEP exposure modes.
2. Press the Menu button and display the My Menu screen, shown on the
left in Figure 11-14.
3. Highlight My Menu Settings, as shown in the figure, and press Set.
Now you see the second screen in Figure 11-14.
4. Highlight Register and press Set.
You’re presented with a scrolling list that contains each and every
item found on the camera’s other six menus, as shown on the left in
Figure 11-15.
5. Highlight the first item that you want to include on your custom
menu.
If you want to add a specific Custom Function to your menu, scroll past
the item named Custom Functions to find and highlight the individual
function. (The item named Custom Functions simply puts the Custom
Functions menu item on your menu, and you still have to wade through
the multiple levels of steps to get to your function.)

You’re returned to the list of menu options. The option you just added to
your menu is dimmed in the list.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 to add up to five additional items to your
menu.
9. Press the Menu button.
You’re returned to the My Menu screen, where the items you added to

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
After creating your menu, you can further customize and manage it as follows:
 Give your menu priority. You can tell the camera that you want it to
automatically display your menu anytime you press the Menu button.
To do so, select My Menu Settings on the main My Menu screen and
then press Set. You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-14.
Highlight Display from My Menu and press Set. Highlight Enable and
press Set again.
 Change the order of the list of menu items. Once again, highlight My
Menu Settings and press Set. Then highlight the Sort option (refer to the
right screen in Figure 11-14) and press Set. Highlight a menu item, press
Set, and then use the up or down cross keys to move the item up or
down in the list. Press Set to glue the menu item in its new position.
Press Menu to return to the My Menu Settings screen; press again to
return to your custom menu.
 Delete menu items. Display your menu, highlight My Menu Settings, and
press Set. Then, to delete a single item, highlight Delete and press Set.
Highlight the menu item you want to remove and press Set again. To
remove all items from your custom menu, choose Delete All Items and
press Set instead. 
Getting Free Help and Creative Ideas
Okay, so this last one’s a bit of a cheat: It isn’t actually found on your camera,
but it will help you better understand the features that are. I speak of the
Canon Web site, which you can access at www.canon.com.
If you haven’t yet visited the site, I encourage you to do so. In the Support
section of the site, you can get free technical support for camera problems
and even download an electronic copy of your camera manual, should you
happen to misplace the one that shipped in the camera box. Most impor-
tantly, check periodically to make sure that your camera is running the latest
firmware, which is the geekspeak term for the camera’s internal software. 
Be sure to also check out the Learning Center section of the site. There, you
can find loads of tutorials and other great instructional offerings not only
about your camera but also about the software that ships with it.
