The measurement
problem
in quantum
mechanics
is re-examined
and it is shown that it cannot really be solved in a
satisfactory way, within the framework
of the usual interpretation
of the theory. We then discuss von Neumann's
attempts
to prove that quantum
mechanics
is incompatible
with the introduction
of hidden variables,
and develop a more detailed
form of Bell s argument,
showing
that von Neumann
s analysis
is invalid.
Using certain ideas that are implicit
in the
"differential-space"
theory of Wiener and Siegel, we go on to propose a new deterministic
equation
of motion, describing
a kind of coupling
of the measuring
instrument
to the observed
system that explains
in detail how the wave packet is
"reduced" during a measurement
in a continuous
and causally determined
way. By averaging
over the hidden parameters,
we then recover the usual statistical results of quantum
mechanics as a special case. However, a more detailed
analysis of
the theory
shows that new experimental
and theoretical
questions
can now be raised, which go outside
the framework
of the quantum
theory as it is now formulated.
These questions
are examined
briefly.
1. INTRODUCTORY
REMARKS
In recent years a number
of articles have been pub-
lished
indicating
a revival
of interest
in the problem
of the physical
interpretation
of quantum
mechanics.
In these
articles it becomes
evident
that
the
whole
question
is far from being settled in a clear and simple
way. It therefore
seems worthwhile
to go into this sub-
ject as carefully as possible. %e shall attempt to clarify
the nature of these questions
and problems, as well as to
suggest
some
tentative
steps
towards
answers
and
solutions.
Now, in one of the most widely accepted interpreta-
tions of the quantum
theory, i.e., that of the Copen-
hagen
school,'' the physical
state of a system
is as-
sumed to be completely
specihed by its wave function
which,
however,
defines
only
the probabilities
of re-
sults that can be obtained
in a statistical
ensemble
of
similar
measurements.
The possibility
that there exist
further
dynamical
variables
determining
the
actual
behavior
of each
individual
system
at the quantum
level is rejected. In support
of this orthodox
doctrine
there
is the well-known
proof of von Neumann'
that
the assumption
of such "hidden variables" is incompat-
ible with the established
results of quantum
mechanics.
On the other hand,
there are theoretical
as well as
practical reasons for regarding
the present
form of the
quantum
theory
as unsatisfactory.
The
now
classic
Einstein —Podolsky-Rosen
paradox'
suggests
that
the
theory
is incomplete
(in spite of refutations
by Bohr

and others) . The results of experiments
involving
very
high energies
(of the order of 10' ev or more)
or very
short distances
(of the order of 10 " cm or less) are
becoming
increasingly
more dificult to explain without
ad hoc extensions
to the theory.
In addition,
many
authors
have suggested
that the reasoning
involved
in
von Neumann's
proof is circular and that the conclusion
is tacitly assumed
in the premises
on which the argu-
ment is based. Other authors
(the most recent of whom
are Iauch
and
Pirons)
d.eny that
the
conclusion
de-
pends
on a
circular
argument.
Still others"
fully
accept
neither
the
Copenhagen
interpretation
nor
von
Neumann's
point
of view
and
yet, at least by
implication,
agree that
the usual
interpretation
is in
essence the only possible
one. Finally, it has recently
been pointed
out by Se08 that von Neumann's
proof
is based
on certain
unnecessarily
restrictive
assump-
tions and that when these are not made the proof breaks
down.
It seems,
then, that the question
of the possibility
of hidden
variables
underlying
the quantum
theory
is
still problematic.
Besides, as we shall
make
clear, if
the claims based on von Neumann's
theorem
are ac-
cepted as valid then it would foGow, from the facts con-
6rming
the current
quantum
theory,
that a different
general structure
of concepts is impossible.
Thus, it is
made to appear that the linguistic
structure
of quantum
mechanics
prevents
even the assertion
of the possibility
that the basic postulates
underlying
the theory may be
false. In effect, this would
mean that certain features
of the basic postulates
of the current
theory
are ab-
solute truths
that can never be falsihed,
or shown
to
be valid only as approximations
or limiting
cases. This

kind of unfalsi6ability
would
be almost
as dangerous
in any
theory
as is the
claim
to unfalsifiability
on
a priori grounds.
There
have
been many
attempts
to develop
other
interpretations
of quantum
mechanics
and a number
of hidden
variable
theories
have
been
proposed, '' "
which
supply
explicit
refutations
of von
Neumann's
proof.
Nevertheless,
these
theories
have
all
suQered
from
various
inadequacies
and,
for
this
reason,
are
largely
ignored
in current
research.
From the outset,
however,
this whole
controversy
has been plagued
by
tacit assumptions,
very often of a philosophical
rather
than a physical
character,
leading
to the kind of diffi-
culties referred to above concerning
the relationship
of
hidden
variable
theories
to
the
experimental
con-
tent of quantum
mechanics
and the relevance
of von
Neumann's
proof. In addition,
the theory of the process
of measurement
involves a great many unclear features
and
unresolved
problems,
arising
mainly
because
the
role of the measuring
instrument
in the
phenomenon
of the "collapse"
of the wave
packet
in a quantum
mechanical
measurement
process is obscure. This has
been referred to as the measuremertt
problem in quantum
mechanics.
In this article, as has been indicated,
it is hoped to
present
the controversy
in a more coherent and unified
manner
and to investigate
and propose
a solution
to
the measurement
problem.
After a review of the basic
principles
of quantum
mechanics
with
the
aim
of
clarifying
the problem,
we shall
consider
the Copen-
hagen
interpretation,
along
with
one of its
modern
variants, " which
latter
aims to give a more
detailed
mathematical
treatment
of the role of the
observing
apparatus
than Bohr does. These attempts
to treat the
"collapse" within the framework
of quantum
mechanics
will be seen to avoid the real problem,
because they do
not,
in fact, propose
a scheme
which
adequately
in-
corporates
the role of the measuring
instrument
into
the dynamics
of a theory
that
includes
the measure-
ment process. The idea that the quantum
mechanical
description
of phenomena
is incomplete,
and that there
are additional
variables
(at present
"hidden")
which
must be taken into account, seems therefore to provide
a very natural
basis for a proper understanding
of the
situation.
Before proceeding
with
the development
of
such a theory, however, it is of course necessary to con-
sider the claim that a hidden
variable
theory
under-
lying
quantum
mechanics
is impossible.
In this
con-
nection,
we shall
discuss
the assumptions
underlying
von Xeumann's
proof3 and
expose
their
inadequacy.

has been a more recent at-

tempt
by Jauch
and Piron'
to establish
the impossi-
bility of a hidden
variable
quantum
mechanics.
This
will be discussed
in a subsequent
paper. )
We present
a hidden
variable
theory
which
is an
extension
of the "differential
space" theory of Wiener
and Siegel"
3
and
develop
certain
ideas
which
are
only
tacitly
implied
in
their
work.
A deterministic
equation
of motion
is introduced
which
couples
the
measuring
instrument
to the observed
system
and so
explicitly
incorporates
the role of the
measuring
in-
strument
into the dynamics
of the theory.
Since the
apparatus
may be regarded,
from a physical
point of
view,
as merely
a particular
case of the
large-scale
environment
of the system,
this suggests
a multi-level
theory
in which
the general
movement
of a system
is
determined
by an
equation
of motion
coupling
the
large scale to the small scale. A measurement
process
is then interpreted
as a special case of this movement,
to which each system is always subject.
An important
feature
of any such
hidden
variable
theory
is its potential
contradiction
with
quantum
mechanics.
The latter is, of course, recovered
in a cer-
tain special case. This theory
therefore
opens up new
experimental
possibilities,
which
are brieRy examined.
It is dehnitely not proposed that the theory developed
here is likely to be a "right" one. Rather,
the main
aim of this theory
is to provide
a language
and a set
of concepts in which it is possible to show clearly the
meaning
behind
the diferent
interpretations
of quan-
turn mechanics
and to indicate what it means to assert
or deny
the existence
of hidden
variables.
However,
the discussion
of the questions
outlined
above
would
almost
certainly
be relevant
in any new hidden
vari-
able theory which might be developed,
even if the form
of the latter were very different
from the theory pro-
posed here. Thus,
while
this theory
serves
mainly
as
an example
for making
the discussion
more concrete,
at the same time it also suggests
certain
new kinds of
experimental
and theoretical
questions
whose relevance
transcends
the
particular
example
of the
theory
in
which they are raised.
2. REVIEW OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF
QUANTUM
MECHANICS
The
basic
principles
of quantum
mechanics
have
been expressed
in many different
ways in various
pub-
lications. It is, however, necessary to discuss brieRy here
certain
essential
features
of the quantum
description,
with the aim of clarifying
what the assumptions
behind
the usual interpretation
of quantum
mechanics
actually
are and how these may be changed
in the development
of a theory of hidden
variables.
In addition,
we shall
attempt
to distinguish
clearly between
those assump-
tions
confirmed
in
experiment
and
those
based
on
largely tacit notions
which are essentially
philosophical

rather
than
physical. It will become
evident
in this
discussion that some of these philosophical
assumptions
underlying
the
usual
interpretation
are
misleadingly
vague
and unclear,
especially
on the question
of the
relation
between
the properties
of individual
systems
and those of statistical
ensembles.
Two of the basic postulates
of quantum
mechanics
are the following:
(1) The state of a quantum
mechanical
system
is
dehned
by a continuous,
single-valued
wave function,
0'(x, t), which
obeys a deterministic
equation
of mo-
tion, Schrodinger's
equation:
iS(8@/ctt) =He.
(2) The wave function
determines
the probabilities
of the
possible
results
of any
measurement
on
the
system. Equivalently,
the average or expectation
value
for an ensemble
of measurements
of any
observable
R is derived
from 4' through
the algorithm:
R=(+,R+) =
+*(x)R(x,—iSV)@(x) dx,
(2.2)
where R is the operator
corresponding
to the observ-
able A.
These
two
postulates,
which
are
fundamental
in
any conventional
formulation
of quantum
mechanics,
incorporate
the notion of probability
into the theory in
an inherent
way. Yet it is not immediately
clear how
the ensembles,
to which
these
probabilities
refer, are
formed and what their individual
elements are. For the
very
terminology
of quantum
mechanics
contains
an
unusual
and signi6cant
feature,
in that what
is called
the physical
state of an indi'vidga/
quantum
mechanical
system is assumed to manifest itself only in an ensemMe
of systems.
Because it is indeed
mysterious
for an individual
system
thus to manifest
itself only in a statistical
en-
semble, there is a tendency
among physicists
tacitly to
avoid this problem
by interpreting
the wave function
as referring
directly to an ensemble
rather
than to an
individual
system.
In other
words,
it is quite
often
supposed
that a wave function
is not to be associated
with an individual
system, but only with an ensemble
of similar
systems.
This interpretation
is in fact un-
tenable,
as can be seen by the analysis
of a simple
hypothetical
experiment.
Consider a two-slit diRraction
experiment
with elec-
trons, which
is set up with a movie camera
replacing
the single photographic
plate in the usual arrangement.
If the 61m moves at the rate of one frame per second
and the electrons arrive at the slit system one at a time
at intervals
of one second, then each frame will record
a different
individual
track. If each electron
is simi-
larly prepared,
then their wave packets are similar
in
shape and will each be represented
by the same func-
tion O'. For example,
suppose
that the electron passes
through
a slit system and a time gate which localizes it
to within a region of size Ar. According to Schrodinger's
equation,
there will be a slowly expanding
wave packet,
initially
of this width,
which
moves
through
the slit
system to the plate. From this wave packet, something
is known
about
the
individual
system;
viz. , that
the
electrort is somewherein
the region where the wave flnction
is appreciable.
Likewise, the momentum
of the electron
is somewhere
in the region
in which
the Fourier
co-
e%cient of the wave
function
is appreciable.
Indeed,
this is just how
quantum
mechanics
approaches
the
dehniteness
of the classical concepts of momentum
and
position
of an individual
electron,
which are, however,
limited
in their
degree
of simultaneous
definition
by
the uncertainty
principle.
Therefore,
if one considers
the movement
of the packet representing
an individual
electron
as it passes
through
the slit system
and de-
velops a set of fringes, according to Schrodinger's
equa.-
tion, one can predict that it will strike a certain region
of one frame of the film in which the transformed
wave
function
4' is appreciable.
After
the
experiment,
a
superposition
of all the frames will yield the diffraction
pattern
determined
by
~ 0 [', where + is a typical wave
function.
Although
they are all represented.
formally
by the same function
of x, each electron
has a wave
function that depends on the time t in its own way (such
that only one electron
is in the system at the time).
The packets are similar in shape, but diGerent
in their
times of going through
the slit system.
Therefore,
the wave function
refers primarily
to an
individual
electron and the statistical
ensembles
refers
to a set of electrons having
different
wave functions
of
similar
shapes.
Nevertheless,
because
the probability
interpretation
is the only physical
meaning
given
for
the precise shape of the wave function
(as opposed
to
its general
extension
in x or p space), it cannot give a
model
of how
the electron
moves
in the slit system,
which is more detailed
than the limits of applicability
of classical concepts
to individual
particles,
as deter-
mined
by the uncertainty
principle.
To bring
out in
more detail what
this means,
we note that the wave
function
of the electron at a point x to the right of the
slits is
e(x) =e&(x)+e&(x),
(2.3)
where +g(x) represents
that part of the wave reaching
the point x that has come from slit A and 4'e(x) repre-
sents that part
which
has come from slit B. If only
slit A were open,
then
the probability
of an electron
reaching the point x would be equal to P~(x) = ) %~(x) ~',
while
if only slit B were open this probability
would
be Ptt(x) =
) %e(x) P. When both slits are open, however,
the probability
is
P(x) =
I +~(x)++~(x) I'
=Pg (x) +Ptt (x) ++~*(x)+e(x)+@e*(x)4'~ (x) .

(2.5)
In addition to the "classical" probability
terms Pz+P&,
P contains
the
interference
terms,
%~*@R+@R+g,
which would not be present if the experiment
involved
a probability
distribution
of classical particles,
coming
either through
slit A or slit B. (These terms may, for
example,
cause 4 to vanish
at certain
points
where
there would have been a nonvanishing
probability
with
only one slit open. ) Therefore
the particle
model
fails
as a description
of the details of the motion
of an in-
dividual
electron
within
the slit system.
On the other
hand,
since the electron
acts like an individual
par-
ticle in producing
a track on one frame of the film, the
wave model also fails to describe the order and structure
of this motion adequately.
At the risk of laboring
an obvious point, we repeat:
Each individual
quantum
system
is associated
with
a certain
wave
function.
All
information
about
the
system is assumed
to be contained
in the wave function
through
the probabilities
that can be deduced
from it.
But this
function
provides
no representation
of the
detailed
movement
of an individual
electron. To call
4 the state functi os of such an individual
electron there-
fore leads to confusion,
because the significance
of this
function
is in general
manifested
physically
only in an
ensemble
of systems having wave functions
of a similar
form.
On
the
other
hand,
because
these
functions
actually
all refer in a certain way to diferent
systems,
it is also wrong to say that the wave function
belongs
oe/y to an ensemble.
It seems therefore that there is no clear physical con-
cept of the detailed state of movement
of the individual
electron.
At best,
then,
the
quantum
theory
can be
regarded
as an elaborate
system of algorithms
for com-
puting
the probabilities
of experimental
results. Never-
theless,
most of those physicists
who follow
the usual
probabilistic
interpretation
of the theory are not con-
tent to do this, so that they are ultimately
faced with
the inability
to provide a satisfactory
resolution
of the
question
of how the individual
and the ensemble
are
related,
as they try to interpret
the algorithms
with
the aid of physical concepts. It will be our intention
to
show that this difhculty
can be removed
by extending
the concepts of the theory,
in a manner
equivalent
to
the introduction
of some kind of hidden variables.
Before continuing
with a third,
and yet more prob-
lematic, postulate
of the usual theory,
we shall digress
here brieQy in order to clarify the distinction
between
pure and mixed ensembles
in quantum
mechanics.
A Pure
(or homogeneous)
ensemble
consists
of in-
dividuals
(e.g., electrons)
which
all have similar
wave
functions,
although
they are generally
ordered
in dif-
ferent places or times. In a pure
ensemble,
therefore,
the typical
wave
function + defines
the probability
distribution
for the ensemble,
so that the expectation
value of an observable E is given by the relation:
A mixed ensemble
is composed
of individuals
whose
wave packets are not all similar; e.g., electrons
which
boil out of a 61ament have a distribution
of energies,
hence a distribution
of wave functions.
If, in a given
representation,
the coeScients
of the expansion
of a
wave
function
4' into
an
orthonormal
(discrete,
for
simplicity)
set of basis functions 5;(x) are P;, then the
expectation
value
determined
by this
wave
function
for an observable E may be expressed as:
8=g P,*Ref;,
(2 6)
(R)A,—
—Tr (f R) .
(2.8)
From
the
above
assumptions,
it
follows
that f is
Hermitian
and (B)A„ is real.
We come now to postulate (3):
(3) After a precise measurement
of the observable
represented
by the operator R yielding
the eigenvalue
R;,
the
wave
function
4'(x) =g,Q,R;(x)
becomes
R;(x).
This
phenomenon
is known
as the
"collapse"
or
"reduction"
of the wave packet and the postulate
in
question
is sometimes
referred
to as the "projection
postulate",
because
the vector in Hilbert
space repre-
senting 0' is projected after the measurement
onto one
of the basis vectors of the representation
in which
the
matrix
of the
operator
representing
the
observable
measured
is diagonal. The postulate
is necessary to en-
sure
the reprodgcibility
of measurement
results:
after
measuring
E and finding
the result R;, an immediate
subsequent
measurement
should
yield the same value
E;, or the theory
would
clearly be inadequate.
It is,
however,
incompatible
with
Schrodinger
s equation,
since an ensemble
of measurements
on systems similarly
prepared
with wave functions +, i.e., a pure ensemMe,
will
yield
a mixed
ensemble
represented
by a prob-
ability distribution
of eigenfunctions,
R;(x), each with
weight p;= t f; ~2. This represents
an irreversible
change
involving
a nonunitary
transformation
of %. In con-
trast to the classical situation,
where every dynamical
process
is, in principle,
covered by Hamilton
s equa-
tions, the measurement
process in quantum
mechanics
is placed in a category on its own.
It may
perhaps
clarify
the situation
to point
out
here
that,
according
to the
usual
interpretation
of
quantum
mechanics,
the process of collapse is equiva-
lent to assuming
that a given wave function
is replaced
where A@is the matrix (5;,RS,).For a mixed ensemble,
the expectation
value is determined
by averaging
over
all the wave functions
present, i.e.,

by a second
wave
function
after
measurement,
but
for no assignable
reason:
the
second
wave
function
cannot be derived as a solution of the Schrodinger
equa-
tion of motion for the systeIn initially
described by the
first wave function. If we consider a pure ensemble
of
similar first wave functions,
as in the cine camera
ex-
periment,
then
this
ensemble
is associated
with
an
ensemble
of second
wave functions
which
will not in
general be pure, i.e., the individual
members
will have
different
wave
functions.
The relative
frequencies
of
these different
second wave functions
are given by the
usual rules of the quantum
theory.
It is not easy to avoid the feeling that such a sudden
break in the theory (i.e., the replacement,
unaccounted
for in the theory, of one wave function by another when
an
individual
system
undergoes
a measurement)
is
rather arbitrary.
Of course, this means the renunciation
of a deterministic
treatment
of physical
processes,
so
that the statistics
of quantum
mechanics
becomes ir-
reducible
(whereas
in classical statistical
mechanics
it
is a simplification —
in principle
more
detailed
predic-
tions are possible
with
more information).
More
sig-
ni6cant
still, a precise
conceptual
description
of the
process of measurement
in quantum
mechanics becomes
in principle
impossible,
so that
one also gives up all
hope of ever being able to obtain a clear conception
of
the nature of the individual
electron or of how it moves.
The physicist
may
have
a rough
picture
of a wave
packet,
which
supplies
a limited
kind
of physical
in-
tuition,
but this does not in any
sense
complete
the
picture of what. the electron is and of what it does.
The deeper
signi6cance
of the lack of such a clear
concept of the electron and its motion can be brought
out more
clearly by considering
the fact that,
in an
ensemble
of electrons with similar first wave functions,
the differences among the second wave functions cannot
be referred
to differences
that exist in the individual
members
of the first "pure" ensemble. Does it not seem
natural,
however,
to suppose
that
differences
in the
later states of an ensemble
of systems should be related
to corresponding
differences
in the earlier states of the
systems?
The assumption
that
differences
appear
in
time
which
are totally
unrelated
to
aery
differences
whatsoever
in the earlier states of the systems
implies
a kind of breakdown
of physical
law that should
not
be accepted
lightly
without
some clear proof that an
assumption
of this nature
is unavoidable.
For, once it
is accepted,
we shall tend very strongly
to cease to be
interested
in looking
for such
relationships,
so that
even if they shouM exist, we are unlikely
to 6nd them.
At this point, the idea seems quite naturally
to sug-
gest itself that the differences
in the second wave func-
tions (after a measurement)
could be referred
to dif-
ferences, before the measurement,
in the values of some
new
kinds
of variables,
at present
"hidden"
(but in
principle
ultimately
observable
with the aid of suitable
new
methods
of observation
may later
be suggested
by thinking
in terms of such variables).
Since the be-
havior
of each system
would
depend
on these hidden
variables, as well as on the wave function,
we can under-
stand
how electrons
with
initially
similar
wave
func-
tions can display
diferent
properties
when
they
are
observed,
through
the differences
of the hidden
vari-
ables before
measurement.
The quantum
mechanical
distributions
of observed results could then be recovered
by averaging
over a suitable
ensemble
of hidden
vari-
ables in the first (pure)
ensemble.
Such a theory
would,
in certain
ways,
be rather
similar
to classical statistical
mechanics,
in which
the
large-scale
thermodynamic
properties,
relationships
of
I', V, T, etc., are explained
in terms of statistical
dis-
tributions
of atomic
variables.
Relative
to the large-
scale level,
these variables
are at first "hidden, " but
(as has been suggested
with regard to hidden variables
of quantum
mechanics)
they are ultimately
observable
with
new
kinds
of instruments —
Geiger
counters
or
cloud chambers
instead
of thermometers
and pressure
gauges —
which have in fact been developed
as a result
of the
new
ideas
suggested
by thinking
in terms
of
atomic concepts.
3. INADEQUACY
OF THE COPENHAGEN
INTER-
PRETATION
AND OTHER RELATED THEORIES
OF MEASUREMENT
There
are
various
reasons
for
developing
such
a
hidden
variable
theory.
As
we
have
indicated,
the
Copenhagen
interpretation
of
quantum
mechanics,
in which the collapse of the wave packet is accepted as
a fundamental
and irreducible
phenomenon
(an ulti-
mate fact of nature
which
is incapable
of any further
analysis),
entails
the renunication
of any conception
of the order
and structure
of movement
of a micro-
system
in favor of a set of rules
for the prediction
of
the results of speci6c experiments.
Of course, a system
of calcula, tion of experimental
probabilities
is useful.
Nevertheless,
science is surely
more than
merely a set
of algorithms
for an engineer's
handbook.
Science also
aims at an Nrlderstuedieg
of the over-all structure
and
order
of movement
of matter
from the atom to the
galaxies. While science also has the aim of prediction
and
useful
application,
these
in
themselves
cannot
correctly
be identified
with
the
whole
of the
a,ct of
understanding,
in which one grasps the order the struc-
ture of a complex process in a uni6ed
coherent
set of
concepts. From these latter, one can abstract relation-
ships
of the parts,
which
make
predictions
possible.
However,
the
difference
between
understanding
and
mere prediction
can be illustrated
by the example
of
trying
to 6nd one's way through
a city that one does
not know. One may be given directions,
which in effect
constitute
predictions
of the order of streets and build-
ings that one will discover if one walks in certain ways.
3ut a map of the city gives a uni6ed
coherent
under-
standing
of its over-all order and structure,
from which
useful predictions
can be taken by reading it. Quantum

mechanics
at present
yields
a coherent
structure
of
mathematics
However,
its physical
cottcepts
resemble
the giving of directions to find one's way through
a city.
Thus,
if electrons
enter
a slit system,
quantum
rne-
chanics predicts
the distribution
with
which
they will
leave. But this is not deduced
from a concept of the
over-all
order and structure
of movement
of the elec-
trons. Rather, as has been indicated, it has the character
of a mathematical
algorithm,
equivalent
to a set of
"directions. "This algorithm
is surely a reaction
of the
whole of natural
law. But to assume
that all theories
must henceforth
take the form of such algorithms
will
evidently
limit
understanding
and
channel
research
into a study of the statistical
properties
of observation
processes involving
such "collapses. "
This point can perhaps
be further
clarified
by con-
sidering
the fact that there is a very important
method-
ological
justification
for the
consideration
of hidden
variable
theories,
even those which are not necessarily
seriously
regarded
as "right" ones. For the language
of
quantum
mechanics
in the usual interpretation
of the
formalism
makes it virtually
impossible
even to assert
linguistically
what is to be meant by the detailed
order
and structure
of this process of collapse,
because
the
denial that this process has any meaning
is incorporated
into the very structure
of the language. In this way the
theory seems to provide a justification
for an inherently
statistical
concept of an individual
system.
This, by itself, is a very serious fault in the present
formulation
of quantum
mechanics.
As Popper"" has
indicated,
it is a basic requirement
of any
scientific
theory that it should
be expressed
in terms that make
it falsijiable. But current
quantum
mechanics
has been
given a linguistic
form that prevents
even the hypo-
thetical
assertion
of the contrary
to any of the basic
postulates,
because
this
would
apparently
entail
a
change
in the experimental
facts on which
the theory
is based. (As will be shown later, it was the aim of von
Neumann's
theorem
to prove this. ) Since to deny the
experimental
content of the theory is evidently
absurd,
and since we can neither
say nor think
anything
con-
trary to the basic principles
of quantum
mechanics,
it
seems
that
the
latter
are
inescapable
and
absolute
truths, proved by a tremendous
number
of experiments.
It is not generally
realized
that in the present
lan-
guage
we can only ask questions
and consider
experi-
ments
that
do not go outside
the
structure
of this
language.
As long as we use this language,
no experi-
ment is ever likely to be devised that could conceivably
refute the basic postulates
of quantum
mechanics
and
thus in principle
provide a test of these postulates.
We
shall always
search for energy
levels, scattering
prob-
abilities,
magnetic
moments,
etc., and if they are not

as predicted
we can always
suppose
that a change
of
the forces between
atoms, the introduction
of particles
with new properties,
new groups such as SU3, SU6, V~2
and other
such orders, etc., will eventually
bring
ex-
periments
back into agreement
wi.th the theory, without
changing
the basic postulates
given
above,
except in
the way of enriching
and
adding
to them:
we need
never
take a step that
contradicts
them.
Of course,
in a way,
every
theory
can be adapted
by means
of
enough
assumptions
to accommodate
any kind of data
whatsoever. But the current linguistic
form of quantum
mechanics
has the further
special feature that it asserts
the logical impossibility
of any other scheme that would
fit the facts as they are known
today. It is, therefore,
necessary
to challenge
such a point of view, for other-
wise it might
lead to our being trapped
in a given set
of concepts, without
our even realizing that we are thus
trapped. As we have already indicated,
we shall do this
by changing
the language
of quantum
mechanics,
so
that questions
may be asked which
would
show what
it could
mean
if the basic postulates
of the current
theory were false. Even if the theory in terms of which
the new
language
is embodied
should
not be correct
in detail, such a questioning
on a theoretical
basis can
be useful,
because it may ultimately
lead to the pro-
posal of experiments
that test these postulates.
A number
of authors,
notably
Ludwig, '~
Green, "
and the group
Daneri,
Loinger,
and
Prosperi"
have
proposed
theories
of measurement
which
take
into
account
the macroscopic
nature
of the measuring
in-
strument.
This point of view differs from that of Bohr
and
the
Copenhagen
school,
since
the
macroscopic
measuring
instrument
is in fact treated
as a quantum
mechanical
system, with certain added conditions which
enable
"macroscopically
distinguishable
states" of the
system to be defined
in some way. These rnacrostates
are, of course, related to probability
distributions
over
microstates
of the
system,
so that
the measurement
process is treated
as a problem
of quantum
statistical
mechanics.
Before the
measurement
interaction,
the
apparatus
is assumed
to be in a thermodynamically
metastable
state, such that a very small perturbation
makes
it
evolve
(irreversibly)
towards
a
thermo-
dynamically
stable state, dependent
on the state of the
microsystem.
The most sophisticated
and general
analysis
along
these
lines
has been
given
by Daneri,
Loinger,
and
Prosperi
and
many
prominent
physicists,
including
Rosenfeld, "have favored
this apparent
solution to the
problem.
The argument
is essentially
that the collapse
of the wave packet
in a measurement
process
is not
really a problem,
because
interference
is destroyed

the process
of amplificatiort
involved
in the detection
of a microsystem
by a macroinstrument,
so that prob-
ability amplitudes
become ordinary
probabilities
in the
irreversible
transition
of the amplifying
apparatus
to
a condition
of stable
equilibrium.
Hence
what
"col-
lapses"
is only
our keoxledge
of the system
and not
some property
of the system itself. However,
in the cine
camera
experiment,
we have
seen that,
according
to
the basic principles
of quantum
mechanics,
the wave
function
always
refers to an individual
system.
The
fact that
interference
between
different
parts
of the
wave
function,
corresponding
to different
values
for
the
observable
measured,
is effectively
destroyed
in
the
amplification
process
does not
explain
why
the
wave function of the individual
total system "condenses"
onto one and only one of the component
noninterfering
wave packets that are produced
in the interaction
with
the measuring
apparatus.
Thus,
the
question
of the
behavior
of an individual
total system is avoided.
In order to clarify
this criticism,
we can also refer
to the example of the measurement
of the
s' component
of the
angular
momentum
of an atom
with
angular
momentum
ft/2 by means
of a Stern —Gerlach
experi-
ment (Ref. 20, p. 593). In this experiment,
an atom is
passed through
an inhomogeneous
magnetic 6eld which
gives it a momentum
that is directed
up or down, ac-
cording to whether
the spin is up or down. The result-
ing s motion of the atom after it leaves the 6eld carries
it to a height that depends
on the spin and, in this way,
a rather
rough
observation
of the position
determines
whether
the spin was up or down.
It can be shown
that, after the measurement
inter-
action, the wave function
of the total system
of atom
plus
measuring
instrument
takes the form of two lo-
calized
wave
packets
which
no
longer
interfere
sig-
nificantly.
But this does not alter the fact that
only
ouse of these packets can be "actual" if the total system
is to be in a certain
de6nite state after the measure-
ment. In terms
of the cine camera
experiment,
if an
individual
electron is sent through
this apparatus,
until
it arrives at the photographic
film it is represented
by
a wave packet spread over a large region of space. When
this packet arrives at the film it begins to interact with
the wave
functions
of the atoms
of the 61m. In the
interaction
it is "broken up" into
many
very
small
packets,
which
cease to interfere
coherently.
What
is
still unexplained,
however,
is that
only
one of these
packets
contains
the electron:
there
is no possibility
within
the theory
of understanding
how and why the
individual
electron
suddenly
"condenses"
into one of
the packets. In other
words,
there
is no logical cor-
rection between
the first wave function,
which may be
regarded
as "broken up" into noninterfering
localized
packets,
and the second
wave
function,
which
repre-
sents a definite result.
"D. Bohm, Quantum
Theory
(Prentice-Hall,
Inc., Englewood
CliBs, N.J., 1951).
To be sure, if we now average over the resulting
wave
functions
in an ensemble
of measurements
on similarly
prepared
systems,
then
the pure
ensemble
of similar
first wave
functions
is connected
statistically
to the
ensemble
of second wave functions,
i.e., the probability
distribution
of second wave functions
is determined
by
the algorithm
of quantum
mechanics. But this averag-
ing process
can only be understood
as an empirical
average
over
the wave
functions
which
are actually
present
after an ensemble
of measurements:
there
is
no corresponding
distribution
of any parameter
over
the
ensemble
of first
wave
functions
which
can be
averaged
over to produce
the resulting
distribution
of
second
wave
functions.
This amounts
to a confusion
between
the individual
and the statistical
interpreta-
tion of the
meaning
of the
wave
function.
For, the
attempt
to regard
the
different
components
of the
"broken up" first wave function
as nothing
more than
probabilities
would
make
sense if the wave
function
were given oely a statistical
interpretation.
The purely
statistical
aspects of the treatment
are in themselves
therefore
perfectly
clear, and would
be still clearer,
if
it made no claims at all (beyond
limits determined
by
the uncertainty
principle)
to discuss the details of the
movement
of individual
electrons. But then, it would
also be very obvious that no explanation
has been given
for how
an individual
electron
arrives
in oee of the
packets. The assertion
that the individual
has in fact
been adequately
treated is just what leads to the con-
fusion,
in which
the one word "electron" is required
at the same time to refer to individual
and statistical
ensemble.
And this assertion
is based on the tacit as-
sumption
that the current
interpretation
of quantum
mechanics
is complete.
Thus, although
the analyses
of Daneri, Loinger, and
Prosperi,
and other such treatments
do help to clarify
the measurement
process to a certain
extent by em-
phasizing
the existence
of an amplifying
stage in the
process, the basic problem
is still unresolved.
A thermo-
dynamic
averaging
operation
is performed
over an en-
semble
and
reasonable
probability
functions
are ob-
tained, but it remains
unclear
exactly what the statis-
tical mechanical
parameters
are. The question
of the
behavior
of an
individual
system,
for
example
the
process of movement
of an individual
electron through
the apparatus
of the movie camera
experiment,
is not
answered. The analysis of Daneri, Loinger, and Prosperi
does not alter the fact that the extended
wave model is
needed
to
describe
the
movement
of the
electron
through
the slits,
while
after
the packet
reaches
the
film and interacts
with it there is a set of noninterfering
localized
packets,
only
one
of which
contains
the
electron.
We conclude
that the attempts
to develop a theory
of measurement
within
the
quantum
theory
do not
succeed in solving the real problem,
and that the order
and structure
of the process by which
a microsystem

such as an electron
is measured
cannot
be conceived
within
the
formalism
of quantum
mechanics
alone.
Before proceeding
with
the development
of a hidden
variable
theory,
however,
we must first dispose of von
Neumann's
proof
that
any
attempt
to explain
the
probability
distributions
of quantum
mechanics
in this
way would
be impossible,
because it would contradict
the experimental
facts on which the theory is based,
4. YON NEUMAN¹S PROOF
Von Neumann's
proof" that
hidden
variables
can
be excluded in quantum
mechanics,
contained
in Chap.
IV of the
"Mathematical
Foundations
of Quantum
Mechanics, "is based on the following
assumptions:
(i) There corresponds
to each observable
of a quan-
tum
mechanical
system
a
unique
hype rmaximal
Hermitian
operator
in Hilbert space. This correspond-
ence is assumed
to be one-one, i.e., each such operator
corresponds
to an observable.
(Page 313.) (In place
of the
term
"observable",
von
Neumann
uses
the
neutral
phrase "physical quantity, "but with the same
connotation. )
(ii) If the observable
R has the operator R, then
the observable f(R) has the operator f(R). (I, page 313.)
(iii) If the observaMes
R, S,
~ ~ have the operators
R, S, ~, then
the
observable
R+S+ ~ ~ ~
has
the
operator R+S+ ... (The simultaneous
measurability
of R, S,
~
~ is not assumed. ) (II, page 314.)
(iv) If the observable R is by nature a nonnegative
quantity,
for example,
if it is the square
of another
quantity
5, then B&0, where B is the expectation
value
of R for an
ensemble
of measurements.
(A',
page 311.)

observables
and a, b,

real
numbers,
then

(B', page 311.)
Two definitions
are also relevant:
(a) An
ensemble
is dispersion free
if (R)'=-(R')„„
for every observable R. (n', page 312.)
(b) An ensemble
is honIogeneous
or pure if it cannot
be split
into
subensembles
with
diferent
statistical
properties. In other words, if the ensemble
is split into
any
two subensembles,
so that R—R'+8" for every
observable R, then 8'=c'R, 8"=c"R (where c', c" are
constants c'+c"= 1; c', c")0).
On the basis of these
assumptions,
von
Neumann
demonstrated
that
there
exists a linear,
semide6nite,
Hermitian
matrix
U' „,such that for any observable E:
R= Q U'„„R„„=Tr (UR).
(4.1)
tnn
Thus,
every
elisemble
in quantum
mechanics
is char-
acterized by a certain
(density)
matrix
(or statistical

R=R(qI

~
~ ~ )
(4.2)
which
is abbreviated
symbolically
to R(q,p). If the
"state" of the system is only defined by certain thermo-
dynamic
(i.e., large-scale)
variables,
then the expecta-
tion value of R for such a system is computed
as the
average
over a suitably
de6ned ensemble
of systems:
R=
p(T, q, p)R(q, p) dqdp=R(T),
(43)
where
the symbol T is used to represent
the thermo-
dynamic
variables
which
define
the "state" of the
system macroscopically
and p is a probability
density.
In the equilibrium
case the statistical or thermodynamic
properties
of the system may be derived from the "nor-
mal" Boltzmann
distribution
function C exp (—E/kT):
R=
C exp (—E(q, p)/kT)R(q, p) dqdp,
(4.4)
where T is the temperature.
In general
we may con-
sider any distribution
function p(T, q, p), in particular
the extreme
case of a b-function,
representing
a dis-
persion free ensemble
in which the values
q, p are pre-
cisely defined
and determine
a value for every observ-
able R(q, p) without
dispersion.
Similarly,
in a statistical
explanation
of quantum
mechanics
by hidden
variables,
there should
be "non-
normal"
distributions
of these parameters
possible
as
well as a "normal" distribution
which would reproduce
the results
of quantum
mechanics.
The extreme
case
of such a "nonnormal"
distribution
would
be the dis-
persion free ensemble,
in which the values of all hidden
parameters
are precisely
defined
and hence determine
operator),
from which
the average
of any observable
can be deduced
according to a certain algorithm.
Since
there
is
no
physically
meaningful
density
matrix which gives zero dispersion
for all observables R,
von Neumann's
first conclusion
was that there are no
dispersion
free ensembles. In addition,
there are density
matrices
which
represent
homogeneous
ensembles,
which means that it is not always
possible to split an
ensemble
into
subensembles
with
diQ'erent
statistical
properties.
The interpretation
of this
result
for the
question
of hidden variables
is that the statistics of the
homogeneous
ensemble
cannot
result
from
averaging
over
the
hidden
variables
because,
firstly,
the
ho-
mogeneous
ensemble
could
then
be represented
as a
mixture
of two diGerent
ensembles
and, secondly,
be-
cause
the
dispersion
free subensembles
consisting
of
one or more individual
systems
in the same precisely
defined state do not exist.
The argument
here follows the analogy with classical
statistical
mechanics.
A classical observable
is dered
as a function
of the coordinates
and momenta
(hidden
variables)
which
determine
the
microstates
of the
system:

a particular
value for every observable.
Von Neumann
demonstrated
that the existence of such "nonnormal"
ensembles,
with
statistical
properties
violating
those
of quantum
mechanics
(which
is certainly
implicit
in
any
hidden
variable
theory),
is impossible.
He con-
cluded this proof with the remark that:
".. . we need not go any further
into the mecha-
nism of the 'hidden parameters'
since we now know
that the established
results of quantum
mechanics
can never be re-derived
with their help""
and he even stressed that:
".. . it is therefore not, as is often assumed, a ques-
tion of a re-interpretation
of quantum
mechanics, —
the present
system
of quantum
mechanics
would
have to be objectively
false, in order that another
description
of the elementary
processes
than
the
statistical
one be possible. ""
Thus, since the concept of hidden
variables
is incom-
patible
with
von Neumann's
assumptions,
and
since
the denial
of these assumptions
would
seem to entail
the denial of the postulates
of quantum
mechanics
as a
special case, it appears that any hidden variable
theory
would
contradict
the experimental
results
confirming
quantum
mechanics.
If von Neumann's
assumptions
are accepted,
then
his conclusion
is indeed
inescapable.
However,
these
assumptions,
in spite of their apparent
innocence,
are
unnecessarily
restrictive.
If
the
dispersion
in
the
measured
values
of an observable
R is assumed to be
due to a distribution
in the values
of certain
hidden
parameters
over
the
ensemble
of systems
measured,
then the expectation
value of R, 8, is clearly to be re-
garded
as an average
over this distribution
of hidden
variables. Hence, the relation
where
the symbol
X is used generically
to denote
the
set of hidden variables
Xq, X2,
and p(X) =p(Xq, 4, . )
is a probability
distribution
function
defined
over the
hidden
variables.
LThe above expression
is, of course,
only true for a pure ensemble.
In the case of a mixed
ensemble,
there is a certain probability, I'(+), of any
particular
quantum
state. Hence R must be averaged
over the distribution
of quantum
states as well as the
distribution
of hidden variables:
(R)A,=Q
U „R p(X) dX,
(4.8)
In an ensemble:
R=P(%', X, R ).
(4.10)
R=
P %)R „p)
dX
(4.11)
and
we would
expect to obtain
the statistical
results
of quantum
mechanics
from
a "normal"
ensemble
speci6ed by some p~(X) .
Von Neumann's
implicit choice of a particular
linear
form for F as a function
of the R „,i.e.,
where
U „ is averaged
over the distribution
of wave
functions,
not over
'A.j
This relation for R implies that, for particular
values
of 4' and X (i.e., the dispersion
free case), the value of
R is determined
by a relation of the form:
R'= P U„„(+',X')R„,
(4.9)
mn
where the ' is used to denote a particular
value of the
relevant
parameter.
This is a linear
relation
between
the value of the observable R and its associated matrix
R
N„o. w, u priori,
there is no reason
why the value
of R should not be determined
by some moelieear func-
tion of 4, the hidden
variables
and the matrix R „:
F=g U. (4, X)R„.,
(4.12)
should be expressed as:
R=g U„R„„,

Von

justified
the
assumption
(v) by the
remark
that it is always
true in quantum
mechanics,
i.e., for any quantum
state 4:
(+, (8+5)@)= (@,M)+(@,5&).
Hence (v) is true for every pure or Inixed ensemble. But
this relationship
could conceivably
be reproduced
for
IIornsal
ensembles,
specified
by
some
pN(X)
without
rejecting the possibility
of a nonlinear
function F. This
would
imply
that
the
assumption
(v)
is in general
false and is valid
only in a certain
special case which
includes
the ensembles
of quantum
mechanics.
(This
has been pointed out by Bell.')
Without
the assumption
of linearity

tacitly
contained
in von Neumann's
assumption
(v),
the proof fails, because it is based
on an analysis
of
the statistical
properties
of the density
matrix
U =
U „(O', X)p(X) dX,
which is now no longer characteristic
of all conceivable
ensembles.
This proof discouraged
further
work on hidden
vari-
able theories
for some time. In the light of the above
analysis
it seems
that
the
proof
rejects
only
those
hidden
variable
theories
which
depend
on a linear
law
of the form (4.7). We shall therefore
turn our attention
to theories
which contain the more general assumption
(4.11):
R=
F(4, X, E
)p(X) dX.
As we have demonstrated,
the assumption
(v) is now
no longer valid and von Neumann's
proof breaks down.
A more recent
impossibility
proof has been proposed
by Jauch and Piron, in which
they come to the same
conclusion
as von Neumann
without
using the linearity
assumption
(4.7) or (v). We shall
demonstrate
the
inadequacy
of this proof in a subsequent
article.
A theory
which
embodied
the possibility
of such a
nonlinear
assumption
for E was first proposed
by one
of us in 1951.' However,
that
theory
was
suggested
merely
in order to demonstrate,
by a counter-example
to von Neumann's
proof,
the possibility
of a hidden
variable
theory. It was not seriously
envisaged
as an
ideal theory and suGered from a lack of simplicity
and
elegance of structure. We now wish to propose a hidden
variable
theory, an extension of certain ideas of Wiener
and Siegel, which
we consider is at least a step toward
what could seriously be considered as a tentative
theory,
insofar
as it suggests
certain
questions
which
we feel
to be relevant.

This dual vector space is different to the original space
and,
whereas
the

Schrodinger's

the dual vector (P I obeys an entirely diGerent

which
we shall discuss presently.
We shall use the components
of the vector (t

sent the hidden
variables
corresponding
to the
X in
Eqs. (4.10), (4.11).
We propose
also that
for the "normal"
quantum
mechanical
ensemble
these
hidden
variables
are ran-
domly distributed
on the hypersphere
of unit radius
in
Hilbert
space
defined
by g,

the aid
of certain
further
assumptions,
which
in effect de6ne
the function F of Eqs. (4.10), (4.11), we shall demon-
strate that this distribution
reproduces
the usual quan-
turn
mechanical
averages
for all observables.
Never-
theless,
the
theory
also
allows
subensembles
which
have less dispersion
than the "normal" ones and even,
in the limiting
case, dispersion

in which

(5.3)
S. THE THEORY
We propose,
firstly,
that one of the basic variables
of the theory
is the wave function %. In fact, as in-
dicated
in Sec. 2 ("Review of the Basic Principles
of
Quantum
Mechanics" ) we regard
the 4 as playing
a
role somewhat
analogous
to the thermodynamic
vari-
ables I', V, T, etc. in classical statistical
mechanics.
As I', V, T, can be known
from measurements
on a
classical
thermodynamic
system
done with
the aid of
suitable
instruments,
so the measurement
of a "com-
plete set of observables"
enables us to know the wave
function
of a quantum
mechanical
system
(by finding
the
eigenfunctions
of the
corresponding
operators).
Thus, after a measurement,
the wave function
can be
known.
At this stage,
this is a basic postulate
of the
usual
theory,
but we shall later derive it from deeper
assumptions
concerning
the hidden
variables.
In order to simplify
the presentation
in the following
we shall consider the problem
of a system
whose wave
function
can be represented
as a vector
in a two-
dimensional
Hilbert
space, for example
a spin-~
par-
ticle without
translational
motion.
Vsing
the Dirac
notation
to represent
vectors
in Hilbert
space,
the
vector
I 4'& may be expressed
in the form:
I +&=&I
I 5I&+A
I 5,),
(5.1)
where
I 5i),
I 5,) is the basis in which
the operator
of
the
spin
observable
S is diagonal.
We assume
that
I +) is normalized
(I QI I'+I fs I'=1).
We postulate
a due/
Hilbert
space, a typical vector
of which
is represented
with respect to the same basis
by:

(We assume
for the present
that the $; are constants,
at least during
a measurement
process. They may be
changing,
but so slowly that this change
can be neg-
lected. during
the measurement
interaction. I.ater,
in
fact, we shall
discuss
such relatively
slow changes
in
the P,.)
If R1)E2 and J2~0, then J1 must
always
increase
and
Ju must
always
decrease.
Since Jl+Ju —

process

Thus, the motion
described
by these equations
pro-
duces the eigenstate
I Sl) or
I Su) after a measurement
of S, representing
a spin value
of +f' /2
d'or —5/2, re-
spectively. In an ensemble of measurements,
this results
in the mixture
represented
by the statistical
operator
f= I p l' lI Sl)(S1I+I4 I'
I Su)(Su I. We
see that
the
result of a measurement
of the spin is determined.
both
by the Hilbert space vector of the system

the dual vector

I $1 I'/I tl I'& 1, then the result is +fr/2, while if Ru& Rl,
or
I $2 I'/I

These
two possibilities
are mutually
exclusive
and
between
them they cover every possible
set of values
of the components
of the dual vector fi, $2 whenever
the quantum
state, i.e., 1J1, $2, is determined.

leaves
and postulate
that,
in addition
to the change
in
I +)
dered
by
the
Schrodinger
equation,
the
following
deterministic
equations
operate
during
a measurement
process of the observable 5:
4'1/dt

(5 4)
where
& is a suitable
quantity
that
remains
nearly
constant
during
a measurement
and negligible
before
and after. (We assume that y is always positive. )
(For simplicity,
we
are
considering
an
irlpudsiute
measurement,
where the interaction
with the apparatus
is so great that the effects of the Hamiltonian
of the

system can be neglected
during
the inter-
action. The generalization
to include arbitrary
measure-
ments is straightforward
and does not essentially
alter
the argument. )
From these equations it follows that:
dJ1/dt=2y(R1 —Ru) J1Ju
dJu/dt= 2y (Ru
R,)J2J,.
—
(5.5)
Hence d( Jl+Ju) dt=0, so that
I lI') remains normalized
during
the measurement
process.
Also:
only the case:
I p, I'= I pl I' and
I $2 I'=
I pu I' a set of
measure
zero which
has no eGect on the statistics:
whatever
we assume
for this case it will have no sig-
ni6cance
for physical
measurements,
which
are never
Perfectly precise.
Now,
in general,
the hidden
parameters
pl,
pu could
have
any
conceivable
statistical
distribution.
As in-
dicated earlier, we demonstrate
that a certain "normal"
distribution,
with probability
function
p~, determines
the usual results of quantum
mechanics.
We write:
Substituting:
$1=pl exp (igl) =Gl+'till

pu=p sing

= 2p' d (sin' @) dp dgl dgu.
(5.9)
We assume
now
that
the dual vector
is also nor-
rnalized, i.e., p= 1, so that the dual point is on the sur-
face
of
the
three-dimensional
hypersphere
of unit
radius in the four-dimensional
space—
i.e., the complex
two-dimensional
space. Hence
we ignore
dp hereafter;
the element of volume
of interest
(with p=1) is
dQ= 2 d(sinu@) dg, dg,.
(5.10)
Our basic assumption
is that p~=constant

Integration
over the range
of sin'P
gives
(with
the
correct normalization
for the surface area of the hyper-
sphere):
&i=I@ I'
(5.13)
For R2)Ri, a similar calculation
gives the result
I P2 I2.
The form of the deterministic
equations
guarantees
that
the Hilbert
space vector
representing
the wave
function
of the system after a measurement
of the spin
S is
I Si) if Ri)R2 and
I S2) if R2&Ri. The inequality
E~&E2 or E2&E~ is maintained
after a measurement,
since
either Ji=j Pi I' or J2—
—
I f2 I' becomes
and
re-
mains
unity
in
this
representation
while
the
other
becomes
and
remains
zero
So, .if Ri)R2 before
the
measurement
then,
since Ri—
—J'i/I $i I' increases
(or
remains
the
same)
during
the
measurement,
while
R2=J2/I b I' decreases to zero (or remains
the same),
this
inequality
is satisfied
after
the
measurement
as
well. Hence
the result
of a measurement
will be re-
produced
if the same observable
is measured
immedi-
ately afterwards
on the same system. This conclusion
is not altered
if the P; should
undergo
a change after
completion
of the
measurement,
because
if, for ex-
ample, Ji=1, J2= 0 we always
have Ri= I fi I'/I gi I'=
1/I 6& I'&1 (and R2= I A I'/I 6 I'=0) for any
values
of $i, $2 (except
I $, I'= 1 and
I $2 I'=0, a set of measure
zero which can be neglected. )
It is clear that we have developed
here a theory of
hidden variables that reproduces
the usual probabilities
of quantum
mechanics
as well as the feature
of the
"collapse" of the
wave
packet.
However,
the prob-
abilities are now the result of a random
distribution
of
"hidden"
variables
(and not "irreducible" ) and
the
"collapse" is due to a deterministic
process that satis-
fies a law that could in principle be studied with regard
to its order and structure
of movement.
Of course, the
theory is similar to the usual quantum
theory
in that
it also makes statistical
assumptions
of a certain kind.
But it is different
in the crucial respect that these as-
sumptions
permit a more general kind of statistics, con-
taining
the usual
quantum
statistics
as one possible
limit, and a "delta function" distribution
of the hidden
variables
as another
limit
(in which
the behavior
is
in fact completely
specified and determined).
In addi-
tion, the theory
opens up the possibility
of a further
study,
aimed at demonstrating
that our statistical
as-
sumptions
might
be justified
(as is done
in classical
statistical
mechanics)
by showing
that
the equations
of motion
of complex
systems
imply
a quasi-ergodic

(5 12)
Integration
over
Oi, 82 (from 0 to 2n)
then
gives the
measure
or probability
of the set of points (on the unit
"shell" ) for which Ri)R2 as:
character
to the solutions.
Evidently,
such questions
would have no meaning
in terms of the usual linguistic
structure
of quantum
mechanics.
Before investigating
these consequences
of the theory
further,
we shall outline
briefly the generalization
to a
Hilbert
space
of E dimensions
(where,
in principle,
Q—moo).
The generalized
deterministic
equations
describing
the change
in
I 4) during
a measurement
process are:
dP;/dt=~; Q J,(R,—R;)
(i=1, 2,. ~ ~, X). (5.14)
If g;
I f;
I =g,J;=1 initially,
a simple
calculation
shows
that d(g; J;)/df=0 and the normalization
of
I +) is therefore
unaltered.
Further,
it is easily dem-
onstrated
that if 8, is a maximum
then J, will increase
faster than any other J;, so that eventually J,—+1 and
all the other J;+0. Thus,
I 4) is projected
onto the
vector corresponding
to the result s. U we assume that
the dual vector
($
I is randomly
distributed
over the
hyperspherical
surface g; I $; I'= 1, then
a
similar
calculation
gives for the probability
of the result s:
P,=
I f. I', in agreement
with
quantum
mechanics.
A
remeasurement
of the same observable
will always yield
the same result.
6. SOME CONSEQUENCES
OF THE THEORY
It may now be of interest
to re-examine
von Neu-
mann's
proof
in the light
of this theory.
As already
indicated,
the theory
goes beyond
the assumption
of
linearity
in the proof: (aR+bS+
~
~ ~ )A,=aR+bS+ ~ . ~ .
For example,
in the spin case, let:
S=0„,
aR+bS+cT = d= cos ad,+ cos pd„+ cos yd„.
(6.1)
d„d„,and 6, are operators representing
the components
of the spin in three orthogonal
directions. The operator
d represents
the component
of the spin in some arbi-
trary
direction
inclined
to these
axes. Consider
the
special
case of a dispersion
free ensemble,
in which
the hidden variables
$i, $q, the components
of the vector
(( I
in
the
dual
space,
are
precisely
delned.
These
parameters
determine
the
result
of every
possible
measurement.
Now,
every
measurement
gives
either
+1 or —1 for o;, 0„,o„and o. Hence, since the distri-
bution
is now a delta function
of the hidden
variables,
we have
0'= 0 = cos 0!0g+ cos 0!00+ cos uog
= cos n(&1)+ cos p(&1)+ cos y(&1).
(6.2)
On the other hand, we also have:
Therefore,
in general, it is not true that o = cos ao.,+
cosPo.„+costa, . So the linearity
assumption
is not

D. BOHM AND J. BUB
Measurement
en Quantum
Mechanecs
465
satisfied
by this model and von Neumann's
proof has
no relevance here.
The
deterministic
equations
which
we
have
pos-
tulated
in
addition
to
the
movement
defined
by
Schrodinger's
equation
have
a
form
dependent
on
the representation
in which
the matrix of the operator
representing
the observable
measured
is diagonal:
Physically,
we postulate
that the representation
chosen
depends
on the effect of the measuring
apparatus.
Thus,
an apparatus
that measures
0., creates a diferent
mo-
tion in the Hilbert space of the wave function
than an
apparatus
that
measures
0-„. These
two motions
are
incompatible:
a movement
projecting
the vector repre-
sentative
of 4' onto one or another
of a particular
set
of axes in Hilbert
space cannot be carried out at the
same
time as a movement
onto another
set of axes.
This provides
a simple explanation
of the impossibility
of measuring
simultaneously
two "observables"
whose
operators
do not commute. The two "observables"
are
associated
with
two different
measuring
instruments,
represented
in the theory by two different
orthonormal
bases in Hilbert
space. From the point of view of the
system
alone,
these
"observables"
represent
certain
"potentialities"
only, i.e., the
wave
function
of the
system,
represented
as a vector in Hilbert
space, de-
termines
only a set of potential
results
for each "ob-
servable". By defining
a particular
set of axes in the
space, the formal effect of each apparatus
is to choose a
particular
set of potentialities
and the hidden variables,
represented
by the dual vector, then determine
which
result in this set is actually
realized.
For this
reason
the term
"observable"
as used
in
ordinary
quantum
mechanics
seems
to be highly
in-
appropriate.
In our theory,
the state of a system
is
determined
by the wave function
as well as the values
of a certain set of hidden
variables,
i.e., these param-
eters
are
sufhcient
to determine
the
dynamical
be-
havior
of the system.
These
additional
variables
are
regarded as being in principle
observable
or measurable,
as in the
statistical
explanation
of the
macroscopic
properties
of matter
we assume
that the atomic vari-
ables are measurable.
On the other hand,
the quantum
"observable"
is no longer
identified
with any physical
quantity
or measurable
property
of the system
in the
usual
(classical)
sense of these terms
and. is not a dy-
namical
variable
of the
system
O,love. Instead,
each
quantum
observable
is to be associated
with a specific
process of interaction
between the system and a certain
"apparatus",
i.e., another
system
with
certain
well-
defined characteristics
which differentiate
it both from
the original system and from other apparatus
systems.
The
hidden
variables
which
define
the state
of the
system
in the sub-quantum
level
determine
the out-
come of this process and it is this result which is labelled
with a specific value
of the quantum
observable.
The
process of interaction
is said to constitute
a "measure-
ment" of the "observable. "
Physically,
the measuring
apparatus
is merely part
of the large-scale
environment
of the system
and it
would be completely
artificial to postulate
a particular
process for "measurement
interactions"
which
would
not also be characteristic
of all interactions
between
a
quantum
system
and its large-scale
environment.
In-
stead of Schrodinger's
equation,
therefore,
we suggest
that the equation
of motion of the system is in general
of the form:
P;=+;g J,(R, E,) —
(e/fi)—Q H;,Q; (t=1, 2, - ~, rt)
(6.3)
where
the additional
nonunitary
term
represents
the
effect of the large-scale
environment
on the system.
We may consider
the possibility
that the motion
of
the wave function
depends
to some extent on all levels
of its environment,
out to the cosmological scale. There
may, for example,
be a "natural"
set of variables
on
the large-scale, say space and time, determined
in some
as yet unknown
way by the relationship
of the atomic
to
the
cosmological
level.
Einstein's
notion
in
the
general
theory
of relativity,
that
the metric
depends
on the large-scale distribution
of matter in the universe,
does suggest
a deep relation
between
the large-scale
and small-scale
levels. It is interesting
to consider such
an extension
of his idea to include
the "natural"
ob-
servables.
Since our
theory
explicitly
couples
the
large-scale
and the small-scale
levels together,
all macro-quantities
can not be calculated
completely
from the micro-laws.
In fact, according
to the Copenhagen
interpretation,
this was always
implicit
in quantum
mechanics,
but
with the unacceptable
qualification
that such a multi-
level theory dealing with the totality, in which quantum
and subquantum
movements
depend
on the large-scale
movement
and vice versa,
is in principle
incapable
of
being developed.
Lastly, it is clear that
the idea of a measurement
distlrbieg
a system
is completely
inappropriate
in this
model. We have proposed
that the wave function
and
Schrodinger
equation
do not provide
adequate
terms
of description
of the whole
physical
process,
and
we
have extended
these terms to include
the dual space,
the effects of the large-scale
level
(which
includes
the
measuring
instrument
as a special case) and the eclua-
tion coupling
the wave function,
the dual vector and
the large-scale level. The motion described by Eq. (6.3)
is in fact the usual motion of the system and a measure-
ment process is only a special and simple
case of this
motion which leads to results that are easy to interpret.
In practice, it is realized by an arrangement
of matter
for which
p is appreciable
for long
enough
to carry

Therefore,
the quantum
mechanical
probabilities
will
not in general be reproduced
for a subsequent
measure-
ment of the spin component
in some other
direction,
unless
there are further
equations
of motion
which de-
fine a quasi-ergodic
movement
of the $,, leading
to an
eventual
random
distribution
of these variables
over
the unit
"shell." These
equations
may,
for example,
be due to a coupling
of the f, with the P, which is neg-
ligible during
a measurement.
As we have shown,
such
a movement
in the (; after measurement
will not affect
the inequalities
E~&E2 or E2&R~, and so will not alter
the requirement
of reproducibility
of the measurement
result. However,
in a long enough time after a measure-
ment
the $; may
be completely
randomized
so that
the theory
will imply
the usual
quantum
mechanical
probabilities
for the results ofa subsequent
measurement.
This raises the interesting
question
of the amount
of
time needed to randomize
the dual vector. This is, of
course,
unknown,
but some plausible
suggestions
can
be made at this stage.
(i) Since most systems
are either
in thermal
equi-
librium
or have emerged
from a source in equilibrium,
it seems plausible
to assume
a random
process result-
ing from this. The characteristic
unit of time of ther-
mal
processes
in relation
to quantum
mechanics
is:
r=fi/kT~10 " sec, for room
temperatures.
Typical
measurements
generally
involve
longer
times,
so that
0' over to one of the eigenfunctions
of the representa-
tion. If y were not great enough
during
the time of the
interaction,
no
nseasurenseet
would
be possible,
but
there would still be a complex change
in + that
would
be difFicult
to interpret.
Thus,
when
a measurement
takes place, the motion
of the wave function
is only
quuetitizely
diferent
from
otherwise,
not qualitative/y.
7. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXPERIMENTAL
TEST OF THE THEORY
The
theory
has
certain
interesting
consequences
which
suggest
situations
in which it might be possible
to test these against
the predictions
of quantum
me-
chanics.
In
the
two-dimensional
example,
which
we
have
analyzed
in detail, suppose a measurement
of the spin
is made
in a certain
direction.
Now,
in order to re-
produce
the
usual
quantum
mechanical
probabilities
it was necessary
to assume
that
the dual vector
Q
~
was randomly
distributed
on the surface
of the unit
hypersphere.
However,
after
the
measurement,
this
vector will no longer be completely
random,
since from
the result of the measurement
it is possible to deduce
that the components
of g
~ satisfy one or other of the
relations:
the
usual
results
of quantum
mechanics
are
to be
expected.
(ii) The time
for randomization
might
be related
to the lifetime
vo of the quantum
state in the conven-
tional
sense of the word. This would
require
that the
equations
of motion
for the dual vector
couple it to
the wave function
in additional
ways that would make
the randomization
process depend
on what is at present
called the "quantum
state. "
The double Stern —Gerlach experiment,
in which two
consecutive
measurements
are made of the spin com-
ponents
in different
directions,
might
provide
a pos-
sible test of the theory. Such experiments
have not so
far been done for short enough
times with the required
accuracy in statistics
(about 1%).
Otherwise,
phenomena
of superconductivity,
super-
Quidity, or low-temperature
measurements
seem to o6'er
the best possibilities
of tests.
Besides investigating
the dependence
of the statistics
of successive measurements
on the time between
them,
one could investigate
the time needed
to "complete"
a measurement,
i.e., to bring
P, to exp (ip, ) and
all
the other P; to 0 (the "collapse" of the wave packet) .
A discrepancy
with the usual predictions
of quantum
mechanics
would overthrow
the whole conceptual struc-
ture and logical foundation
of orthodox
quantum
me-
chanics and open up the possibility
of investigating
the
order and structure
in the process of measurement.
8. MEASUREMENT
OF THE "HIDDEN
VARIABLES"
As indicated,
the P; are "observable. " At present,
the $; are unobserved,
since no experiments
have so far
been designed to test for their effects. This is, of course,
understandable
since the very existence
of such vari-
ables has generally
been tacitly and explicitly
assumed
to be in convict with the experimental
facts of quantum
mechanics.
However,
they
are not
intrinsically
un-
observable.
Thus, in the spin example,
after the meas-
urement
of the spin component
in a certain direction,
if there
has been no time for randomization,
) 4') is
either
~ SI) or
( S~) and hence the variables
(I, f2 must
be such as to satisfy
either
the inequality E»1, or
R2)1. This is a rough observation
of the f, Asubse-.
quent measurement
of the spin component
in a different
direction
would restrict the possible range of values for
the $; still further.
This process can be continued
until
a fairly
accurate
measurement
has been made. It is
clear that
the "hidden"
variables
are in principle
as
observable
as the P;, but they must be observed
with
the aid of techniques
based on new relationships
arising
in a time sequence of successive measurements
relation-
ships that cannot
even be stated
or thought
about
in
terms of the linguistic
structure
of the usual interpreta-
tion of the mathematical
formalism
of quantum
me-
chanics.

9. GENERALIZATION
TO A RELATIVISTIC
THEORY
It may be as well to mention
here that the equation
of motion:
(63)
is both nonlocal and nonlinear.
The change in the com-
ponent P, of the state vector depends
in a complicated
way
on the values
of all the other
components.
The
analogous
equation
for the continuous
case:
would
therefore
imply
that
the
change
in the wave
function at a particular
point in space depends
on the
values
of the wave
function
at every
other point
in
space.
Clearly
there
is no possibility
of generalizing
this
theory
to include
relativistic
phenomena
if the
equation
of motion is retained
in its present form, which
incorporates
an explicit causal mechanism
whereby
any
eGect in one part of space is instantaneously
transmitted
to another part. The theory is therefore limited to non-
relativistic
phenomena.
Another
limitation
of the
theory,
connected
with
this nonlocal
character
of the equation
of motion,
is
that
only
complete
measurements
are
now
feasible.
For example,
in the case of a composite
system
con-
sisting
of two
interacting
particles,
the
theory
only
deals with a process of measurement
in which the state
vector
of the
composite
system
"collapses"
onto
an
eigenvector
of an observable
of the composite
system.
The possibility
of carrying
out a measurement
on one
particle
alone
does not exist: this can be interpreted
now
only in the sense that a complete
measurement
has been made and certain
information
ignored.
Con-
sequently,
the paradox of Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen
does not arise in this theory, because a composite system
must always be regarded as an indivisible
totality which
in principle
cannot
be subdivided
into independently
existing
units.
(This
is really
the
essence
of Bohr's
refutation
of the paradox. ) Of course,
this is a fault
and not an advantage
of the theory,
which
has been
formulated
in terms which
exclude the framing
of the
paradox. If the paradox is accepted as a real inadequacy
in our present
theoretical
description
of certain
phe-
nomena,
then
the problem
of finding
a theory
which
satisfactorily
resolves the paradox remains.
As we have
repeatedly
emphasized,
we regard
the
present nonrelativistic
theory merely as a step towards
a more elaborate theory, which should include relativis-
tic phenomena.
The Einstein —Podolski —Rosen paradox
seems relevant
in this -connection
and suggests
a pos-
sible line of research, i.e., we require
a theory
which
resolves
the paradox
in the terms
in which it is pre-
sonted. Nevertheless,
in spite of its shortcomings,
the
nonrelativistic
theory does provide a theoretical
struc-
ture
which
makes it possible
to discuss
relationships
which go beyond
those of formal
quantum
mechanics,
relationships
which
we
believe
are
relevant
to the
understanding
of the measurement
problem.
10. IRREVERSIBlLITY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
EQUATIONS
OF MOTION
It is a well-known
fact that the equations
of motion
of both
classical
and
quantum
mechanics
are
time-
reversible,
in the sense that to every
solution
of the
equations
representing
a forward
motion there is a cor-
responding
solution
representing
a reversed
motion.
The
irreversible
behavior
of
macro-systems
is
ex-
plained
in a statistical
sense as the average or probable
movement
of a system
from
one imprecisely
defined
state to another.
Boltzmann's
H theorem
is applicable
to such
systems
and
the
irreversible
transition
to a
condition of macroscopic or thermodynamic
equilibrium
is characterized
as a transition
to a condition
corre-
sponding
to a minimum
value
of H, i.e., a maximum
value
of the entropy, —B. In formal
quantum
me-
chanics,
an entropy
can be defined
which
is zero for
pure
ensembles
and positive
for mixed
ensembles
so
that the collapse
of the wave packet leads to an in-
crease
in entropy,
i.e., the
process
of measurement
itself introduces
an irreversible
change
in the state of
the system
measured.
However,
as we have seen, the
measurement
process in quantum
mechanics
is rather
obscure and even an analysis which treats the measuring
instrument
as a
macroscopic
system
cannot
avoid
certain
inherent
problems.
Nevertheless,
it does seem
that the irreversibility
associated
with a measurement
process, in the sense of an interaction
between a micro-
system
and a macro-system,
may be very significant
for the whole question
of irreversibility
and the "arrow
of time" in general
which,
in view
of certain
recent
experiments
indicating
a
breakdown
of
the
CPT
theorem,
is still a controversial
subject.
In the theory developed
here, the fundamental
equa-
tions
of motion
are
clearly
irreversible.
The
terms
pP,g, J;(R;—R;) in the equations (63):
describe
an
exponential-type
decay
of (n—1) com-
ponents P; of the wave function
in a particular
repre-
sentation
and a simultaneous
exponential-type
growth
of one component f, to a limiting
absolute
value of 1.
This process is intrinsically
diferent
in character
from
the
reverse
process
Lan
exponential-type
growth
of
(se—1) components
of the wave function
and a simul-
taneous
exponential-type
decay
of one
component),
which
could not, therefore,
be described
by equations

of the same form. Hence
there
is no reverse
motion
of the
system
which
would
develop
the
initial
past
wave
function
from
the 6nal eigenfunction
produced
by the movement
described by these equations.
As well as being reversible,
the equations
of motion
of classical
mechanics
are time-symmetrical
with
re-
pect to the prediction
of the results
of future
measure-
ments
from a given
initial
state
and
the
retroChctiorI,
of the results
of past measurements
from a given final
state. Thus, Hamilton's
equations
can be used to retro-
dict the past, by following
the solution of the equations
backwards
in time, in the same way that they can be
used to predict
the future,
by following
the solution
forwards
in
time.
On
the
other
hand,
in
quantum
mechanics,
whereas
the
equation
of Inotion
for the
wave
function
is formally
time-reversible,
the prob-
abilistic
interpretation
introduces
an asymmetry
with
respect
to prediction
and
retrodiction.
For example,
an initial pure ensemble
of systems,
each in the same
quantum
state, will yield a mixed enseIDible after meas-
urement.
From
a knowledge
of the
initial
quantum
state, it is possible
to predict
the relative
frequencies
with
which
the different
states will actually
be found
in the Ineasurement.
However,
if one uses Schrodinger's
equation
to calculate
what
the
wave
function
must
have
been
before
the
measurement,
this
will not
in
general
give
a correct
statistical
retrodiction
of the
earlier states, from which the system
came (assuming,
for exainple,
that someone
else had already made such
a set of measurements
and. that the data were available).
It seems to be characteristic
of all statistical
theories,
and not necessarily
a feature
of quantum
mechanics
alone, that
the predictive
and retrodictive
situations
are
symmetrical
only
under
certain
special
circum-
stances. Katanabe23
has argued that phenomenological
one-way-ness
has its origin in the very notion of prob-
ability, i.e., the temporal
asymmetry
is related
to ir-
retrodictability
and has nothing to do with the structure
of the dynamical
laws. He formulates
general
criteria
for retrodictability
and predictability
and
shows
that
quantum
mechanics
is irretrodictable,
microscopically
as well as macroscopically,
whether
or not it is invariant
with respect to time-reversal
in the usual sense.
Aharanov,
Bergmann,
and Lebowitz'4
have
also in-
vestigated
time-symmetrical
situations
in
quantum
mechanics.
They demonstrate
that if both
the initial
and
final
states
are
fixed,
then
the
predictive
and
retrodictive
formulae,
from the initial
and final state,
respectively,
to an intermediate
state
(later
in time
than the initial state, but earlier in time than the final
state)
are symmetrical.
If only one state is fixed, i.e.,
the initial or final state, the predictive
and retrodictive

formulae
are asymmetrical.
The explanation
suggested
for this asymmetry
is that,
while
the future
behavior
of a micro-system
depends
on the present
(macroscopic)
boundary
conditions,
which
de6ne its quantum
state,
we do not believe that the past behavior
of the system
can be affected
by the boundary
conditions
which
we
choose to establish
now.
In our theory,
the equations
of motion (6.3) can be
used to predict, for a certain future
time, the result of
the measurement
of the "observable" defining the repre-
sentation,
if the hidden
variables
are known,
or the
probabilities
of different
results if the hidden
variables
are not known.
They
make
no sense
retrodictively.
Thus, the asymmetry
of prediction
and retrodiction
is
associated
with
the time irreversibility
of the funda-
mental
equations.
In order
to solve
the problem
of measurement
in
quantum
mechanics,
we have proposed
a hidden
vari-
able theory
which
incorporates
a basic irreversibility
into
the dynamics
of an interaction
coupling
micro-
and macro-levels.
This is a new concept; it provides
a fresh
insight
into the asymmetry
of prediction
and
retrodiction
in quantum
mechanics and its development
in a more sophisticated
theory might conceivably clarify
the
relationship
between
macro-
and
micro-physics
and the nature
and origin of irreversibility
in general.
&i. CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated
the falsity of von Xeumann's
proof, which rejects the possibility
of hidden
variables
underlying
the statistics
of quantum
mechanics,
both
by exposing
the inadequacy
of the assumptions
upon
which
the proof is based and by explicitly
developing
a hidden
variable
theory.
The
current
formulation
of
quantum
mechanics
must
be regarded
merely
as a statistical
algorithm,
which
provides
no conceptual
structure
in terms
of
which
the
movement
of individual
systems
can be
understood.
In order to be able to raise questions
about
the behavior of individual
systems, it seems to be neces-
sary to extend the linguistic
structure
of the theory by
the concept of hidden
variables.
The problem
of meas-
urement
is at present
a problem
only because
of an
inadequate
set of concepts
and
the
confusion
which
arises with
the attempt
to interpret
this set as com-
plete. There is, therefore,
no solution
to the measure-
ment
problem
within
the
framework
of
quantum
mechanics.
A careful analysis
of the reasons for the inadequacy
of the von Neumann
proof suggests
that,
in ord r to
succeed,
a hidden
variable
theory
should
incorporate
a nonlinear
relation
between
the value
of a quantum
mechanical
observable
and
the
precise
state
of the
systerm.
In the
theory
proposed
here,
a completely
speci6ed physical
state is dehned
by two vectors: the
Hilbert space vector of the system and the dual vector.

Measurement
in Quantum

From
this
point
of view,
the
quantum
mechanical
specification of the state of a system by a wave function
only, represented
by a vector in Hilbert
space, is in-
complete and we recover the statistical results of quan-
tum mechanics
from an ensemble
of systems
with the
same
) 4') vector but with a random
distribution
for
the dual vector
(& ) representing
the hidden
variables.
The "collapse" of the wave packet in a measurement
process is described, by a nonlinear
deterministic
equa-
tion of motion, as a real dynamical
process which takes
a certain amount
of time to complete. The measuring
apparatus
is regarded
as a part of the large-scale
en-
vironment
of the system
and its inhuence
is reQected
in the above
equation
of motion
by the representa-
tion chosen.
This suggests
a genera, l modification
to
Schrodinger
s equation
and an interpretation
of a physi-
cal process as a coupling
of the large-scale
and small-
scale levels. The measurement
process is then merely
a particular
case of this process. This theory has some
interesting
consequences,
which may be used to provide
an
experimental
comparison
with
the
predictions
of
quantum
mechanics.
In particular,
the
equation
of
motion
introduces
an inherent
irreversibility
into
all
physical processes, which becomes especially
significant
in the case of a measurement
process.
The theory, in its present form, suGers from a number
of inadequacies,
but it does'provide
a new conceptual
structure
in which certain questions
can be considered,
which cannot even be formulated
within the framework
of quantum
mechanics.
Thus,
to describe
the
same
facts in a new linguistic
structure
may be significant.
The rather prevalent
idea that dif'ferences
of language
for saying
the same
thing
are aheays
unimportant
is
false. In some cases a different
language
opens up a
diferent
structure
of thinking
and thus
leads to new
kinds
of actions
in relationship
to nature.
What
is
needed
now
is a hypothetical
tentative
approach,
to
attempt
both by theory and by experiment
to inquire
into the conditions
in which quantum
mechanics
might
break down, to reveal a new structure
of physical
law
and a new order in physical Inovement.
Experiments
de-
vised
in order
to study
questions
raised
in such
an
inquiry
could, in principle,
falsify the basic principles
of quantum
mechanics
and show the need for new ones.
