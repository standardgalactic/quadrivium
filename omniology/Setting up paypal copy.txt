For this method you will need; 
 
 a PayPal (Active and Verified is better, but not required) 
 
 
A paypal account is required for this method since we will be using ebay. If you 
have a previous account, I suggest creating a new one for this method. 
 
 
Make a PayPal premier account. Except your country, fake all of your addresses 
and do not add a bank or a credit card. Do not make up a random address; 
PayPal will check if your address is real. For your phone number, put in your real 
phone or you can get one online if you donâ€™t want to use your real information 
(you will need a valid phone number later for ebay.
