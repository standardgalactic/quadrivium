UBUNTU FOR NON-GEEKS

 

PRAISE FOR UBUNTU FOR NON-GEEKS
“A fast, crystal-clear topical tour of the amazing collective accomplishment 
embodied in Ubuntu. I learned something new in every chapter, and ended up 
with a computer that did more of what I wanted it to do, faster. This book should 
come with every Ubuntu Live CD—it’s just the documentation I needed to take 
some of the mystery out of my machine.”
—BOING BOING
“Highly recommended to all Ubuntu newcomers.”
—PC WORLD
“If you’re a Linux novice, or an experienced user who wants a good book to 
recommend, I give this book a big thumbs up.”
—LINUX TODAY
“This very nice book on Ubuntu Linux is clearly targeted at the neophytes who 
wish to take their first steps in installing and using Ubuntu. The author explains 
in a step-by-step manner the solutions to the problems that one might face in 
installing, configuring and using Ubuntu Linux.”
—SLASHDOT
“Grant makes it seem easy with his step-by-step instructions and plenty of 
screen shots.”
—LINUX.COM
“This is a good, practical book that reads well and doesn’t involve the victim in 
lots of superfluous stuff.”
—UNIX REVIEW
“With books like this in the hands of non-geeks, the lines of distinction between 
geeks and non-geeks might just begin to blur!”
—IT WORLD
“The best thing in Rickford Grant’s Ubuntu Linux for Non-Geeks is plenty of 
practical examples.”
—LINUX MAGAZINE
“Highly recommended for both new Linux users and new computer users in 
general.”
—BLOGCRITICS

friend, John Cremin, who was kind, completely selfless, and a truly good 
heart. I miss you both.

Rickford Grant
My computing life began long ago, in the Commodore/Atari days. No doubt 
inspired by Alan Alda’s television commercials at the time, I purchased my 
first machine, an Atari 600XL with a cassette drive for storage and 16KB of 
RAM—more than I thought I would ever need. Most of my time on that 
machine, I must admit, was spent playing cartridge-based games and tran-
scribing pages and pages of machine code from the now-defunct magazine 
Antic to create even more games. Eventually, my interest in computers 
increased, especially after seeing my first (and actually the first) Macintosh 
at the UCLA bookstore. The very in-your-face nature of the Mac’s operating 
system caused me to become an operating system maniac. To date, I have 
worked with a lot of different operating systems, including Mac OS up to and 
including OS X, every Windows version from 3.1 to 7, and even IBM’s much 
forgotten OS/2.
Though tempted to join the Linux fray, I continued to steer away from it 
for a long time because I could not help but see it, as so many others do, as a 
system for never-seen-the-light-of-day-faced, late-night Dr Pepper–drinking, 
Domino’s-pizza-eating compu-geeks. However, when I moved to Japan and 
was suddenly surrounded by machines loaded with Japanese versions of Win-
dows, I encountered numerous problems, especially language constraints. 
Since everything, including Help files, was written in Japanese, I ended up

using only a fraction of the full potential of most software. Then there were 
those annoying Windows-type problems, such as the constant freezes and 
restarts and the gradual system slowdowns, which were eventually remedied 
only by reinstalling the system. Getting the software I needed to do the things 
I wanted to do also took its toll on my wallet, and I began to rethink my initial 
resistance to Linux. With Linux’s multilingual support, system stability, and 
extensive and free software packages, there were plenty of incentives for me 
to get over my preconceived notions about the typical Linux user.
After a few failed attempts at getting Linux to work on the oddball, 
Frankenstein-like collection of junk that was my computer, I finally suc-
ceeded with a CD-based Knoppix distribution, which worked well enough 
to reel me in a little further. I moved on to Mandrake (now known as Man-
driva), since that was claimed to be the most newbie-friendly version, and 
then I tried SUSE as well, which I found to be rather quirky. Eventually, I 
tried Red Hat Linux and stuck to that because it just didn’t give me any grief; 
and I, like most others, do not want any more grief than necessary.
I started off with my three desktop machines at work and home set up as 
dual-boot systems running both Linux and Windows, but I gradually found 
myself using only Linux. Although I had expected to encounter numerous 
limitations in Linux that would force me to return to Windows often, I 
instead found that I had actually increased my productivity. Other than 
lack of native support for Windows streaming media, I was actually able to 
do more because of the extensive software base that was now installed on my 
machine. Without having to fork out money that I could ill afford to spend, I 
was able to manipulate my digital images, rip songs from CDs, create vector 
drawings, create PDF files, and do a variety of other things that I wasn’t able 
to do under Windows. It was only a matter of time before my dual-boot setups 
became full Linux-only setups. I ceased to be a Windows user.
Since those early Linux days, I have gone on to try a number of other dis-
tributions, including JAMD, Xandros, Damn Small Linux, and more recently, 
Ubuntu. I am happy to report that things have continued to get easier and 
better, and those early frustrations I suffered trying to get things to work with 
this machine or that piece of hardware have become more and more a thing 
of the past. Best of all, with even more distributions being available as live CDs, 
which allow you to try Linux before you actually install it, you usually don’t 
even have to take a leap of faith to get started.
Of course, getting started in the world of Linux can be a bit intimidating, 
especially when you don’t have anyone around to help you out. In fact, I 
actually started writing this book as a primer on Red Hat 9 for my mother, 
whom I had just given one of my extra computers with Red Hat installed. At 
that time, I was not planning on writing a book at all; it was just that there 
really weren’t any books out there written with average users in mind. The 
books available then were all more or less geek-oriented, and as such, they 
would just not do for the mater. I thus created a somewhat elaborate instruc-
tion set that would tell her everything she might want to do on the machine 
in a way that she could understand.

My auntie caught hold of the “manuscript” and decided that I must try to 
publish it. I responded with the obligatory, “Yeah, right,” before putting it 
out of my mind for a while. My auntie, being a rather persistent character, 
however, did not relent, and so I moved to quiet her by submitting the book 
for publication. Surely a rejection slip would do the trick; however, I did not 
get a rejection slip, and instead my first book, Linux for Non-Geeks, based on 
Fedora Core I, was born. I later switched to Ubuntu, and the Non-Geeks line 
followed along with Ubuntu for Non-Geeks.
I continued with two subsequent editions of the Ubuntu books, but my 
new day job was making it harder and harder to devote the time necessary to 
keep the whole book up-to-date and up-to-snuff and get it all written in a 
rather limited timeframe. It seemed time to bring in a coauthor to keep things 
moving. Enter Phil Bull. Phil was the technical editor on the third edition of 
Ubuntu for Non-Geeks, and because of his familiarity with the book, in addition 
to his work on Ubuntu documentation, he seemed a perfect candidate for 
the job. The fact that he lives closer than I to Stanage Edge, where I imag-
ine myself one day standing, pulling the Keira Knightley Pride and Prejudice 
pose, didn’t hurt matters either.
Such rêves de vacances aside, having Phil in on the project has allowed us 
to not only update the book so as to reflect changes in the system and bun-
dled applications, but also to expand it to cover changes in available technol-
ogy and hardware and to address suggestions from readers of past editions. 
These changes, I believe, have made for an even more well-rounded volume 
than before—a book that even better serves the original purpose of the series: 
helping you get into the world of Linux easily and comfortably. 
Phil Bull
I worked as the technical reviewer on the previous edition of Ubuntu for Non-
Geeks. This time around, Rickford and Bill felt that the book could use some 
fresh input and asked me to coauthor. I was happy to oblige!
So, what’s my background? Well, computers have taken up most of my 
free time since I was eight years old. I started off playing games on my 
uncle’s old DOS machine, and I soon found myself ripping apart our home 
PC and putting it back together again just to see how it worked. The geeki-
ness doesn’t stop there; I taught myself to program using Microsoft Word 
and Visual Basic for Applications (ugh) when I was 14, and I even worked in 
technical support for a while in my teens. However, physics became my call-
ing in life at the end of school, and now I study cosmology full time. I haven’t 
completely forsaken computers, though; it turns out that numerical simula-
tions are pretty important in my line of work, and I currently spend a lot of 
time simulating particle collisions on an eight-core Mac inexplicably named 
“WiganPier.”
My Linux journey started off with an old copy of PC Pro magazine from 
1999. There was an article on this weird, alien-looking operating system in 
there, and I just knew I had to try it out. Unfortunately, my dial-up modem 
balked at the prospect of downloading a 650MB file, so I had to wait until 
some time around 2004, when a friend sent me a Xandros Linux CD. The

rest, as they say, is history: I rapidly migrated to Fedora, and then settled 
down with Ubuntu in 2006. Not long after, I started writing documentation 
for Ubuntu, a pastime that I’ve kept up ever since. I just love to figure out 
problems, and writing clear, understandable instructions for people felt more 
productive (and often, more challenging!) than doing the crossword.
Writing this book with Rickford is, in many ways, the culmination of the 
last decade or so of my computing life, and I hope you’ll find my contribu-
tions to this volume fun, easy to read, and above all, useful. In the rest of this 
section, I’ll explain the changes I made and some of the logic behind them.
All manner of online activities, formerly the preserve of hard-core nerds, 
are now part of the non-geek’s daily routine, so I’ve given our Internet cover-
age a significant overhaul to reflect this. New in this edition are an introduc-
tion to social networking with Twitter and Gwibber, setup instructions for 
“3G” mobile broadband connections, and extra tips on using the Firefox web 
browser.
Ubuntu isn’t just a collection of software; there’s a large, friendly com-
munity behind the project, and everyone is invited to participate. This can be 
a little unexpected for those used to the rigid, corporate world of computer 
stores and support hotlines that most other operating systems inhabit, but 
the “community vibe” really is one of Ubuntu’s killer features. I’ve tried to 
get that message across in the new Chapter 20. You’ll learn about how the 
community works, what the community can do for you, and how you can join 
in and help out if you like. In particular, there’s lots on getting help and sup-
port via IRC and the forums.
Computers go wrong from time to time, so chances are you’ve learned a 
few tricks to deal with Windows hiccups or Mac disasters over the years. How-
ever, experiencing a problem as a new Ubuntu user can be daunting, since 
you may not yet have the experience to know how to handle it. To help you 
out, I’ve included a whole new chapter of troubleshooting tips and tricks. 
Although some specific, common problems are covered, I’ve kept most of 
the discussion quite general. The idea is to equip you with a problem-solving 
toolkit comparable to the one you painstakingly built up over the years for 
your previous operating system, and I hope that by the end of Chapter 21 
you’ll feel much more confident if faced with an unexpected error or mis-
behaving hardware.
One of the most common stumbling blocks for Linux newcomers is the 
first one, installation—so we’ve really beefed up our coverage of it this time 
around. A big chunk of Chapter 21 is dedicated to solving installation prob-
lems, so you can feel more confident than ever to try out Ubuntu. There’s 
one new appendix (A) dedicated to installing from a USB memory stick, which 
is the method of choice for owners of netbooks and other computers lacking a 
CD drive. Hard disk partitioning is another oft-cited source of bewilderment, 
so I’ve added another new appendix (C) packed with advice on how to man-
ually partition your hard disk during installation, too.
Once Ubuntu is installed, you may find that you miss certain aspects of 
your former operating system. For most people, that former operating sys-
tem is Windows, so I’ve added a new chapter (18) on getting Ubuntu and

Windows to play together nicely. There’s some enhanced coverage of Wine 
too, so running Windows programs in Linux need no longer be a chore.
This Ubuntu release comes with some big changes in the way you install 
applications. Things are much simpler now, so to reflect this we’ve consoli-
dated pretty much everything you need to know about software installation 
into Chapter 6. Gone are the ugly workarounds and complicated programs 
that were sometimes necessary to get a program installed; they’ve been 
replaced by safer, more elegant ways of doing things, like the Ubuntu Soft-
ware Center, PPAs, and APT-URL.
Finally, in response to the common, but erroneous, gripe that there are 
“no games for Linux,” Rickford and I have dedicated the whole of Chapter 17 
to the state-of-the-art in Linux gaming. (Rumors that it was inserted purely so 
that we could goof off and play a bunch of games have been greatly exagger-
ated.) Don’t forget to check it out; we tried to include something for everyone.
New material aside, we’ve been over the book with a fine-toothed comb 
to check that everything is accurate, up-to-date, and easy to understand. I 
hope you enjoy reading it. Oh, and one last thing . . . welcome to Ubuntu!


A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S
There are a good number of people who deserve thanks for the help and 
support they provided either while or before this book was written, and there 
are still others whose help will come after the book is released. I (Rickford) 
would like to acknowledge all of them now.
Starting with my family and friends, I’d like to thank my mother, Dixie 
Angelina Burckel-Testa; my auntie and uncle, Danica Lucia and David Zollars; 
and Sumire, who continues to inspire me with her art and creativity. And, 
somewhere in the dimension between family and geistfreund, a special shout-
out to Mini—“Pakalaka!” I also send thanks to my long-time friends Donald 
Hammang, Tracy Nakajima, and Kimberly Jo Burk, who help to give me a 
needed sense of continuity and balance; and to my very dear friends back in 
Japan, Keith Hagan, Enryo Nagata, and Setsu Uesaka, who keep me con-
nected with the sensibilities and joys I acquired there. Very special thanks 
also go out to my godfather, Theophan Dort, who is an always kind and 
patient ear for my incoherent ramblings and who does his best to keep me 
relatively sane in the context of my otherwise whacko world.
In the production of any book, editors are so very important, and so I 
would like to thank the editor of this edition of Ubuntu for Non-Geeks, Keith 
Fancher, who had the unenviable task of dealing with files flying in from two 
different authors, one of whom (me) is particularly good at mucking things 
up in the numbering and attachments department. Good job, Keith! Thanks 
also go out to Milo Casagrande, the technical editor on this edition, who did

his best to ensure that all of the details in the book were straight duck, and 
Kim Wimpsett, the copyeditor, who made sure that every t was crossed and 
bit of orphaned text was found and dealt with. Thanks also to those folks 
whose job it is to turn the jumble of text and images we submit into a book—
Megan Dunchak, Ansel Staton, and Riley Hoffman, who also taught us a 
thing or two about indexing. Sweet! And finally, a very special set of thanks 
go out to William Pollock for not only taking a chance on the completely 
unknown writer that I was but also for turning me on to a great pupuseria in 
San Mateo, California.
Having worked on my own for the previous editions of this book, working 
with a coauthor this time around was a new and pleasant experience, and for 
that reason I would also like to add a couple lines of thanks to that coauthor, 
Phil Bull. Working with Phil not only provided me with some new inspiration 
and ideas for the book, but it also made working on this edition a lot more 
fun and less lonely than working on the previous editions had been. It’s 
always nice to have someone to bounce ideas around with. 
Finally, a special thanks to my sweet little black cat and dear feline 
friend, Muju, who, despite vociferously protesting as I spent her time writing 
this book, continues to listen to whatever I have to say and keeps me sane 
when I’m feeling down—though I admit to losing it a bit when she demands 
that I spin her around on my swivel chair at 4 AM. Such is life in service to 
one’s cat. Meow.
With two authors you get two sets of acknowledgments, so I’d like to take 
this opportunity to thank all of the people who’ve helped me (Phil) through 
the writing of this book, too.
First and foremost, I want to thank my parents, Julie and Jeff, for all of 
the love, support and home cooking they’ve provided over the years. Someday, 
as an expression of my gratitude, I might even remove all of my old computer 
junk from their house! I’d also like to acknowledge my sister, Ellen, for keep-
ing things interesting; Nan, Gramps, and Nana for their affection; and my 
auntie and uncle, Pam and Roy Beeson, for being (mostly) willing Ubuntu 
guinea pigs.
Emily Johnstone has been superb in putting up with my nonsense and 
helping me through some of life’s little obstacles. I hope she knows how 
much I appreciate her friendship. My good friends (and fellow nerds) Kiran 
“K-Dizzle” Joshi and Leo “Tenacity” Huckvale waded through my initial scrib-
blings and gave me the confidence to keep writing, and Will “Willybobs” 
Whyles was the inspiration for the troubleshooting chapter; thanks, guys! 
I’m also grateful to Adam Blundred who, despite his misguided attempts to 
convince me that Windows is better than Linux, has been a wonderful friend, 
and to Matt Glover, Jamie Poole, and the other folks back in Stoke for all the 
fun times.
While I’ve been in Manchester, Christina Smith, Amanda Jackson, 
Michel Schammel, Sarah Johnson, Sara Rehman, and Jack Mason have made 
every day interesting, and their friendship has been so important to me. Sally 
and the Millican family have also been a big part of my life these past few 
years, and I’m grateful to them for all the adventures we’ve shared. Thanks

must go out to the guys in the physics department at the University of 
Manchester, too; Bob, Richard, Fred, Lucio, Giampaolo, and all the rest 
have turned me into the cosmologist I am today (whether they intended to 
or not), and I’m sincerely grateful for their support.
Being part of the open source documentation community maintains my 
faith in humanity. It’s a privilege to be involved in the Ubuntu and GNOME 
projects, and people like Matthew East, Shaun McCance, Paul Cutler, Daniel 
Holbach, and Emma-Jane Hogbin are the reason why. In particular, I’d like 
to single out Jim Campbell for his endless generosity and Rich Johnson for 
trying to get me use my accent for no good.
This is my first book, and the guys at No Starch Press have turned the 
process from a daunting leap into the unknown into a rewarding and plea-
surable experience. Keith Fancher, our editor, has been a rock; his com-
ments and advice always cut straight to the point, and without his guidance 
it’s fair to say I would have been lost. As our copyeditor, Kim Wimpsett has 
dealt admirably with the task of turning the output of two different authors 
into a readable, coherent whole, and Milo Casagrande deserves thanks not 
only for the sterling job he made of the technical reviewing but also for giv-
ing me a place to stay one windy night after a post-conference visit to a blues 
bar. Riley Hoffman, Ansel Staton, and all the other folks behind the scenes 
should also be praised for their hard work in getting this book out on the 
shelves. Lastly, I want to say thanks to William Pollock for a series of out-of-
the-blue job offers that have kept me pleasantly occupied over the last couple 
of years. It’s always fun working with you!
Finally, I’d like to express my gratitude to my coauthor. This edition of 
Ubuntu For Non-Geeks wouldn’t have been possible without the extremely solid 
base he’s put in place over the course of the previous revisions, and working 
with him has been nothing less than enjoyable. Thanks, Rickford!


I N T R O D U C T I O N
If you’re standing in the aisle of your 
local bookstore reading this right now, you 
may well be wondering who this book is for. 
Ubuntu for Non-Geeks, as you might imagine, is 
for readers who are interested in Linux but who 
feel the need for a jumping-off point of sorts.
If you’re familiar with computers but unfamiliar with Linux, or if you are 
somewhat familiar with Linux but not with Ubuntu, this book is for you. This 
is not primarily a book for those seasoned geeks or power users; it’s an intro-
ductory guide that will provide you with some hands-on experience that will 
get you up, running, and comfortable with the Ubuntu Linux distribution 
without pain. Think of this book as a map, a compass, and a comfy pair of 
hiking boots, rather than a harness, a rope, and a set of crampons. 
Version Compatibility
This fourth edition of Ubuntu for Non-Geeks is based on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid 
Lynx) Desktop edition. The CD bundled with this book is the Ubuntu Desk-
top CD, which lets you both try Ubuntu without installing it and install

Introduction
Ubuntu to your hard drive once you’re ready. It’s called a live CD. You can 
boot your computer from the CD and run Ubuntu directly off the CD with-
out touching your hard disk so that you can see if you like Ubuntu and make 
sure that Ubuntu will work with your hardware. If, after running the live CD, 
you like what you see and everything seems to work, you can install Ubuntu 
on your computer using the same disc. (There are instructions for doing so 
in Chapter 2.)
NOTE
The world of computers is dynamic, and there may be changes in the software or the 
links to the files for projects in this book after publication. Please see http://www
.edgy-penguins.org/UFNG/ for updates.
Concept and Approach
This book is intended as both a handy reference and a dynamic learning 
experience: You’ll get some hands-on experience as you work through it. 
The text is organized by increasing skills, so that as much as possible you 
won’t be asked to do something that you haven’t already learned. In addi-
tion, you can put the various morsels of knowledge you acquire into practice 
through several exercises, or projects. 
The projects in this book serve a secondary purpose as well: By working 
through them, you will learn to configure and customize your Ubuntu sys-
tem. By the time you finish this book, you should have pretty good mastery 
over Ubuntu. 
These chapter descriptions should give you a better idea of what is in 
store:
Chapter 1: Becoming a Penguinista—Welcome to the World of Linux
What’s Linux? What’s Ubuntu? What’s a distribution? Can I . . .? Will 
my . . .? Chapter 1 holds the answers to these and many other questions 
you might have as it introduces you to the world of Linux and what it 
takes to get it up and running on your machine.
Chapter 2: Wading and Diving—Running and (If You Like) Installing Ubuntu
The CD that comes with this book works as both a live CD and an install 
CD. Chapter 2 tells you how to run a live Ubuntu session from the CD 
and, assuming you catch the Linux bug after doing so, how to install 
Ubuntu on your hard disk either as your sole operating system or 
together with Windows.
Chapter 3: A New Place to Call Home—Getting to Know the Desktop
Regardless of whether you are an émigré from the Windows or Mac 
worlds, you’re probably already familiar with the concept of a desktop. 
Chapter 3 points out the differences between Ubuntu’s GNOME desk-
top and the one on your previous operating system, and it teaches you 
a number of cool tricks you can use to customize the look and feel of 
things. It also includes a couple of nifty GNOME Easter eggs (hidden 
surprises).

Introduction

Chapter 4: More Than Webbed Feet—Connecting to the Internet
“Have computer, will cybertravel” could well be the mantra of the Inter-
net age, and that being the case, Chapter 4 is an indispensable part of 
your Ubuntu experience. In this chapter, you will learn how to connect 
to the Internet and set up wireless and mobile broadband connections. 
You’ll also find tips for using a modem and some handy troubleshooting 
advice just in case you struggle to get connected.
Chapter 5: Slipping and Sliding—Exploring the Internet, Linux Style
With Chapter 4 behind you, it’s time to get serious about all this Internet 
business and start putting it to good use. Chapter 5 takes you on a tour 
of Ubuntu’s suite of Internet applications, in particular the Firefox web 
browser. You’re introduced to Ubuntu’s email and instant messaging 
tools before embarking on a crash course in social networking with 
Twitter and Gwibber.
Chapter 6: Rounding Out the Bird—Downloading, Installing, and Updating 
Programs the Easy Way
The default Ubuntu installation includes most of the software you need, 
but there is still much more available out there, free and waiting on the 
Internet. Chapter 6 teaches you how to easily download and install appli-
cations using the Ubuntu Software Center. You’ll learn about system and 
application updating and how to broaden your software horizons using 
third-party repositories.
Chapter 7: A Tidy Nest—File and Disc Handling in Ubuntu
From creating folders to copying files to browsing your system and net-
work, Chapter 7 covers all things file management. You’ll learn how to 
work with USB storage devices, transfer files via Bluetooth, burn data 
CDs and DVDs, deal with CD-RW disks and multisession CDs, and create 
space-saving compressed archives of files and folders.
Chapter 8: Dressing Up the Bird—Customizing the Look and Feel of Your 
System
Tired of looking at the same old desktop? Feeling nostalgic for the desk-
top in your previous operating system? Chapter 8 tells you how to beat 
the déjà vu blues by changing the look and feel of just about every visual 
element of your system and how to take control of Ubuntu’s visual effects 
engine, Compiz.
Chapter 9: Simple Kitten Ways—Getting to Know the Linux Terminal and 
Command Line . . . and the Cool Things It Can Do
Many people shy away from Linux because they perceive it as a system in 
which everything still needs to be done by entering commands. That per-
ception is, as the saying goes, a load of squashed avocados. Still, there is a 
lot of cool stuff that can be done via the command-line based Terminal, 
and Chapter 9 will tell you all about it as it tames your fears and piques 
your interest in commands. Really.

Introduction
Chapter 10: Gutenbird—Setting Up and Using Your Printer and Scanner
Just about everyone with a computer has or needs a printer. Chapter 10 
tells you exactly how to get your printer (or scanner) working with 
Ubuntu.
Chapter 11: Polyglot Penguins—Linux Speaks Your Language
Need to jot off a note in Urdu? Write a book in Korean? Send a letter in 
Chinese to your friend in Chengdu? Chapter 11 gives you what you need 
to read and write in just about any language in the world.
Chapter 12: Penguins at Work—Getting Down to Business in Linux
Work can be a drag, especially when there are so many other things you 
could be doing. Still, wearing the ole’ fingers to the bone is part of life 
for just about everyone outside of a Jane Austen novel, and you’ll be glad 
to know that Linux has lots to offer in this regard. Chapter 12 introduces 
you to the various productivity applications available.
Chapter 13: Brush-Wielding Penguins—Linux Does Art
Those with an artistic bent will find Chapter 13 especially useful. Work-
ing with your digital camera, modifying images, and building web albums 
are just some of the topics covered.
Chapter 14: Tux Rocks—Music à la Linux
Chapter 14 is the music lover’s treasure trove. You’ll learn how to rip 
CDs, encode MP3 or Ogg Vorbis audio files, and even create your own 
mix-and-match audio CDs. Several audio ripping and playback applica-
tions are also covered.
Chapter 15: Pluggin’ In the Penguin—Working with Your iPhone, iPod, and 
Other Digital Media Devices
Do you have an iPod? An iPhone? A Droid? A $19 MP3 player from the 
flea market? Want to use it in Ubuntu? Chapter 15 tells you how.
Chapter 16: Couch Penguins—Video and DVD Playback in Ubuntu
Sitting in your dorm room trying to figure out how to play your DVD 
copy of The Baxter on your Ubuntu-ized computer? Just finished filming a 
video of your sibling talking while asleep and want to do some creative 
editing of the evidence? Chapter 16 covers these and other video-related 
topics.
Chapter 17: Feathered Flippers—Linux Gaming
If music and art don’t keep your mind off things enough, Chapter 17 
presents you with more diversions: games. In addition to learning what 
games your system comes with, you will also learn how to add more and 
even how to run Java-based games.
Chapter 18: Penguins at the Gates—Working with Ubuntu in a Windows 
World
Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is probably here to stay (for the fore-
seeable future, at least). Chapter 18 shows you how to share files between 
Windows and Ubuntu over a network, install Windows fonts, and even 

Introduction
xxxv
install Windows programs to run under Ubuntu. Dual-booters take note: 
You’ll learn how to access your Windows files from Ubuntu and change 
the boot menu.
Chapter 19: Defending the Nest—Security
Although Linux is about as safe and secure an operating system as you 
are likely to use, Chapter 19 tells you how to add a few additional lines of 
defense to your system.
Chapter 20: A Colony of Penguins—The Ubuntu Community
If there’s one thing that sets Ubuntu apart from most Linux distribu-
tions, it’s the friendly, ever-growing Ubuntu community that surrounds 
it. In Chapter 20 you’ll learn how to participate in the Ubuntu commu-
nity by reporting bugs, sharing ideas, and talking to other users. 
Chapter 21: Wounded Wings—Fixing Common Problems
Don’t panic! If a computer problem crops up and is spoiling your fun, 
flip to Chapter 21 and take heed of the many (and varied) trouble-
shooting tips within. You’ll find fixes for the most common issues, and 
some general advice on diagnosing and treating your poor PC.
Appendix A: Installing Ubuntu from a USB Flash Drive
What with the proliferation of netbooks in recent years, installing 
Ubuntu from CD is beginning to seem a little passé. Appendix A shows 
you how to install Ubuntu from a USB memory stick, which will be par-
ticularly useful if your computer lacks a CD drive or if you found the disc 
included with this book far too attractive to not be used as a coaster.
Appendix B: Ubuntu Desktop CDs for AMD64, Opteron, or Intel Core 2 Users
The CD bundled with this book is designed to work with i386 processors. 
It will also work with most 64-bit processors, although not in 64-bit mode. 
If you’ve got what it takes to run Ubuntu in 64-bit mode, Appendix B will 
show you how to get what you need to do it.
Appendix C: Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk
If the basic partitioning advice in Chapter 2 wasn’t enough for you, 
Appendix C shows you how to carve up your hard disk as you desire, 
free from the constraints of the Ubuntu installer’s sensible, but ulti-
mately simple, suggestions. If you’re a dual-booter and want an easy way 
to share files between Windows and Ubuntu, this appendix is for you.
Appendix D: Resources
Are you crazy for Ubuntu and want to say so? Check out a forum. Do you 
have a hardware compatibility question? Some websites seem to have all 
the answers. Are you looking for free downloads, or do you want to read 
up on the other Linux distributions? Appendix D is a great place to start.

Introduction
How to Use This Book
You can use this book simply as a reference, but that’s not the main idea 
behind its design. Ideally, you should go through the book chapter by chapter, 
doing the projects along the way. This will give you a much broader under-
standing of how things are done (and of how you can get things done), and 
it will reduce the chance for anxiety, confusion, and, worse yet, mistakes.
It is best to read this book and complete its projects when you are relaxed 
and have time to spare. Nothing makes things go wrong more than working 
in a rush. And keep in mind that Linux and the projects in this book are fun, 
not just work exercises. Linux is fun so enjoy it!
About the Conventions Used in This Book
There are a few points worth noting about the conventions used in this book. 
Items in bold type are ones that you need to click or manipulate in any way, 
such as buttons, tabs, and menus. Where words or phrases are defined, they 
have been set in italics. Text to input into a Terminal window is in a bold 
monospace font. 
About the Projects in This Book
The projects and other information in this book are primarily geared toward 
readers who have installed Ubuntu using the CD that comes with this book. 
Most of the information also applies to Ubuntu live sessions run from the live 
CD. Note, however, that some projects and actions cannot be performed in 
live sessions because they require write access to your hard disk, which is not 
possible during live sessions.

Welcome to the World of Linux
In this first chapter, we begin our project 
to get you up and running in the world of 
Linux. If you have already made the com-
mitment and have Ubuntu installed on your 
machine, you are essentially ready to go. Others of you 
might have made the commitment psychologically but
have yet to act on that commitment. And some of you are probably reading 
these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering about Linux and about 
whether you should spend your money on this book or on a latté every morn-
ing for the next couple of weeks. For those in this last group, I can only say, 
“Get this book.” Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.
In any case, the first thing we need to do is get you up to snuff on what 
this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and 
what you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions 
along the way and, if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by 
the time you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, 
your doubts will be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. 
Anyway, until you are ready to make the commitment, you can still follow 
along, because the CD that comes with this book contains, in addition to the 

2
Chapter 1
Ubuntu installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a 
taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience without having to even touch what you 
have on your hard drive. You can kick back, put your worries in check, and 
go with the flow.
What Is Linux?
Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is 
really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it 
can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it to 
do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The 
OS takes a well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and 
educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do. 
You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many 
operating systems that exist today, or did in the past. Windows, DOS, OS/2, 
and Mac OS are all such operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, 
however, different from these other operating systems, in terms of both its 
capabilities and its heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by 
some corporate wanna-be out to make money. The Linux core, referred to 
as the kernel, was created by computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a member of 
Finland’s Swedish ethnic minority, who wanted to create a Unix-like system 
that would work on home computers—particularly his.
Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to 
the world, so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it 
better and more powerful. It is this combination of applications built around 
the core of the Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions 
today.
Linux has acquired many fans and followers since its creation in 1991. 
Such devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, 
reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, 
on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are 
no windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once 
you are behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly 
a black-screen, command line–driven operating system. I guess you could 
think of it as DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the 
thought. Sorry.
Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by 
typing commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things 
when Linux is used as a server), you don’t have to do that. It is fair to say that 
with the advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user 
interface (GUI, pronounced “goo-ee”), DOS users began suffering something 
akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The 
final result was Windows, which gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-
wary users into the Microsoft world. 
Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to 
go graphical. The community at large developed various GUIs (called window 
managers and desktop environments) and a subsystem with which to handle them 
(somewhat confusingly referred to as the X Window System) to bring about the 

Becoming a Penguinista

change. The graphical desktop environment that is included in your Ubuntu 
distribution—GNOME—is one example of the fruit of that development.
About the Penguin
You may have been wondering about the penguin in the chapter title, so I 
might as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as 
the Linux mascot, and what has come to be thought of as the Linux penguin 
was designed by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see Figure 1-1). This explains 
not only the ornithological references and graphics throughout the book but 
also why there are so many penguin icons in Linux distributions and so many 
programs that include penguin or Tux, such as TuxRacer, XPenguins, and 
Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps 
explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to as Penguinistas. True, Ubuntu 
doesn’t play up the penguin as much as other distributions, but Linux is 
Linux, and so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too . . . just a bit less conspicuously.
Figure 1-1: Tux, the Linux mascot
Why Should You Use Linux?
People use Linux for different reasons. For many, it is a matter of power, stabil-
ity, multilingual capabilities, or even personal philosophy. However, for others, 
crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money. Just think for a moment about 
what it usually costs to get started with an operating system. Go to wherever it 
is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make a list in your 
head of all the things you want to buy and how much each costs: an office 
suite; a game or two; maybe a graphics program with which to make yourself 
look better in your digital photos; and a collection of all those firewall, antispam, 
antivirus, and anti-adware programs that you really need to protect yourself 
in the Windows world. Now do the math.
After you pick yourself up off the floor, you will understand that we are 
talking big bucks here. On the other hand, for the price of this book, you will 
have all of the things you wanted and more in the Linux world. Despite the 

4
Chapter 1
worries that many people have, making the move to Linux means not only 
savings for you but also more computing versatility. You will not be hamstrung 
at some point along the way because you don’t have this or that program 
when you need it most—you’ll have it all from the get-go or else be able to 
download it easily . . . and at no cost!
You might counter with the fact that there are a lot of freeware applica-
tions out there for other operating systems, but c’mon, let’s face it—these 
are often rather limited in terms of their capabilities. The programs with a lit-
tle more oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these 
days are limited in some way, or they let you use them only for a short time 
unless you are willing to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, 
but $25 here and $35 there eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of 
change. There is also the problem that some of these programs, unbe-
knownst to you, install backdoors or keyloggers or make your system a sud-
den garden of adware. Finally, at least in my experience, the majority of such 
programs are hardly worth the money asked.
Is It All Just About Money?
Although money is important to the average user, it is certainly not the only 
reason for taking the Linux plunge; there are a variety of other reasons as 
well. As I mentioned, Linux is noted for its stability. Try running your cur-
rent system for a month without restarting and see what happens. Linux has 
been known to run without a reboot for more than a year without a hitch or 
decrease in performance. With its multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a 
perfect choice for language students or users in a multilingual environment.
In addition, Linux is infinitely customizable: You can get your system to 
look and act the way you want it to without being “wizarded” to death. And 
then there are the applications that come with most Linux distributions. In 
addition to their wide variety, most are well up to industry snuff, with some, 
such as Evolution, the GIMP, and Inkscape, being sources of envy for those 
outside the Linux world.
Finally, with the advent of Microsoft’s Windows 7 system and its more 
demanding hardware requirements (especially if you want to take advantage 
of its most touted new features), you may find your current machine on the 
fast track to obsolescence. Turning it into a Linux machine will ensure it sev-
eral more years of working life. After all, it’s a shame to put good hardware 
out to pasture so early. 
But Is Linux Really Ready for the Desktop?
Despite the advances Linux has made in recent years, this question still pops 
up quite often, and that’s fair enough. But consider this: When you install a 
program on your current Windows system and get an error message saying 
that the program can’t run because some DLL file is missing, or when you 
connect a piece of hardware and can’t get it to run, no one asks if that oper-
ating system is ready for the desktop. 

Becoming a Penguinista

In my own experience, I have found no reason to doubt that Linux is 
ready. Sure, Linux has its occasional quirks, but so does every other operat-
ing system. Linux is ready and able. If my mother, hardly a computer wiz, can 
do the work she needs to do and can keep herself amused until the middle of 
the night using her Linux system (without blowing the whole thing up), then 
I think it’s pretty safe to say that you’ll do all right too. 
What Is a Distribution?
An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different 
functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and distrib-
ute the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer 
in working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has 
fallen to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user groups, and 
even private individuals. These entities create Linux system and application 
collections called distributions, or distros. You could bypass such distros and try 
to collect everything you’d need to set up a system all on your own, but you 
would undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the 
geekiest, opt for the distros. 
Most of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, basically 
consist of the same main elements: the core operating system (that’s the 
Linux kernel I mentioned earlier); some sort of installer program to get all 
the system parts and applications properly installed on your machine; the X 
Window System to provide graphical interface support; one or more graphi-
cal desktop environments; and a series of applications, such as word proces-
sors, audio players, and games; as well as all the files needed to make these 
things work.
There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared toward 
specific audiences, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, program-
mers, system administrators, and specific language users. What makes each 
distro different is the software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well 
as other convenience features such as the package (or application) installation 
mechanism and the installer for the system itself. Some distros are especially 
appropriate for home users because of their ease of installation. Ubuntu, a 
relative newcomer to the Linux world, is one of these, joining other distros 
that have long been popular in the ease-of-use arena, such as Mandriva, SUSE, 
and Fedora Core. Although some of these entities charge for their distros, 
most also provide them free for download.
What Is Ubuntu?
Ubuntu is a completely free, easy-to-use, and extremely popular Linux distri-
bution that is geared toward the desktop user. It is one of the hottest Linux 
distros in the marketplace today. It is also one of the few Linux distros with 
what could be described as a social agenda behind it.

Chapter 1
Ubuntu was the brainchild of South African millionaire entrepreneur 
Mark Shuttleworth, who is probably better known for being one of the first 
space tourists—the first African in space, to be exact. Shuttleworth invested 
more than $10 million in starting the Ubuntu Foundation based on his belief 
in free software and in order to fix what he describes as “bug #1”—Microsoft’s 
dominance of the desktop PC marketplace (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+bug/1). 
As Shuttleworth states the following in his blog (available at https://
wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth): 
I believe that free software brings us into a new era of technology, 
and holds the promise of universal access to the tools of the digital 
era. I drive Ubuntu because I would like to see that promise delivered 
as reality.
As you can see, it’s a vision thing.
Befitting the nationality and goals of the man who brought it into being, 
the word ubuntu comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu, accord-
ing to Wikipedia, is a concept meaning something along the lines of “humanity 
toward others” or “I am because we are.” If you’re interested, the 2005 film In 
My Country, although not one of the greatest films ever produced, is on many 
levels a 100-minute examination of the concept of ubuntu.
Why Ubuntu Then?
With so many distros out there, you may wonder why you should opt for 
Ubuntu. Well, as they say, numbers don’t lie, and Ubuntu’s popularity is 
not without good cause. These traits are especially crowd pleasing:
Easy to install
It’s fair to say that most Linux distributions these days are pretty easy to 
install (and definitely easier and faster to install than Windows). Ubuntu 
is right in line with these improvements, and the fact that you can install 
it with only a few mouse clicks while running the live CD means it is pretty 
much ready to go whenever you are. 
Easy to use
Ubuntu is easy to use in that it is very Windows-like in operation, and yet 
it’s more Linux-like than other Windows user–oriented distributions. It 
is designed with the needs of real people in mind, not just compu-nerds 
and geeks.
DEB based
Ubuntu is based on the Debian distribution, which means that it utilizes 
Debian’s very convenient DEB package system for application handling 
and installation. The two preconfigured, graphical package installers 
that come with Ubuntu make installing applications even easier. So 
many packages are available for Debian systems like Ubuntu that you are 
likely to find more software out there than you’ll ever know what to do 
with.

Up-to-date
Some distros are updated at a snail’s pace, while others strive to be so 
cutting edge that they are often plagued with bugs. Ubuntu, with its 
reasonable six-month release cycle, tries to stay as up-to-date as possible, 
while at the same time making sure that things are not released before 
they are ready for prime time. In this way, you are ensured of having an 
up-to-date yet less buggy distro at your disposal.
Dependable and robust
I know these terms come across as mere hype, but after you smack Ubuntu 
around a bit, you come to understand what they mean. Knock things 
down and around, and they bounce right back—this is very important 
for beginners who often have a knack for screwing things up. Nothing 
turns a new user off more than a twitchy system that has to be velvet-
gloved all the time.
Desktop user–oriented
A lot of Linux distributions, although quite capable in the desktop arena, 
cater more to geeks and developers, taking up valuable disk space with a 
lot of junk you’ll probably never use. Ubuntu’s purpose is to grab desk-
top market share from the Redmond folks, so the needs of the common 
end user are always in mind. The result is that Ubuntu’s GNOME desk-
top environment is a very comfy place for the average desktop user to be.
Hardware Compatibility
Well, enough of this background babble; it’s time to get things rolling. If you 
haven’t installed Linux on your machine yet and are wondering whether you 
can, rest assured: Ubuntu will run on most machines out there today. Of course, 
you just never know until you get up and running. There are so many minor 
parts to your machine that it is difficult to say whether each part will cooperate 
with your installation. There are video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, 
and so on, and they all need to be considered.
Diving In
If you are going to buy a new machine on which to run Ubuntu, then it is rea-
sonable enough to do a bit of worrying and check things out first, but if you 
are going to install it on the machine you have, I recommend just diving in. 
After all, you don’t really have to install anything the first time out. You have 
a live CD right here in this book, after all, so you can just pop that CD in your 
drive, boot up your machine, and, biff, bam, zowie, you’ll be up and running 
(or not) in a minute or two. If everything seems to be going as it should . . . 
well, your worries are over, and you can go ahead and install the system when 
you’re ready and willing. That is one of the Ubuntu advantages—not only do 
all the essentials fit on a single CD (compared to four or more for other distros), 
but that CD is both a live operating environment and the installer! You can’t 
get much more convenient than that.

Chapter 1
When Research Is Required
If things don’t work out for you with the live CD, you can start by taking a 
look at Chapter 21. If you don’t find the answer to your problem there, 
search the Web to see whether you can identify what part of your hardware 
puzzle is causing your problems. (Or if you are looking to buy a machine on 
which to install Ubuntu, you can search for hardware that is supported by 
Linux.) Of course, before you can do this, you need to know what models of 
hardware you have. You should know at least what motherboard, central pro-
cessing unit (CPU), monitor, and video card you have if you want to be able 
to find out anything of value. Identifying your CPU and monitor should be 
easy enough, but the motherboard and video card may require a bit more 
searching. 
If you have no documentation that clearly states the make and model 
of these devices, you can find out most things you need to know from within 
Windows by going to the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking System, 
and then clicking the Hardware tab in that window. Once on the Hardware 
tab, click the Device Manager button, and see what you can find about your 
system components. Sometimes the information there is rather limited, so 
you might instead want to try a shareware application such as HWiNFO (http://
www.hwinfo.com/) or Sandra (http://www.sisoftware.net/) to get more useful 
details, such as the specifications of your motherboard or the supported 
video modes for your current setup.
Both HWiNFO and Sandra should give you the information you need 
about your motherboard, but if they don’t (or if you don’t feel like bothering 
with them), you can always just open the case of your computer and look at 
your board, though I wouldn’t recommend doing so if you have a laptop. 
Once inside, you needn’t worry about damaging anything because you don’t 
need to touch anything—so don’t. You may need a flashlight to find it, but 
the model name and number should be stamped on there somewhere, either 
in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example, says 
quite clearly in the middle of the board “AOpen MX46-533V.” You should be 
looking for similar information.
Once you have all your information, you can do a variety of things to 
check out your hardware’s compatibility with Ubuntu. You can simply do a 
Yahoo! or Google search by entering your motherboard’s make and model 
plus the word Linux. This works for other hardware devices too. 
You can also post a question to the Ubuntu User Forums (at http://
www.ubuntuforums.org/) or one of the other various Linux forums or mailing 
lists on the Web. Chapter 20 might provide you with additional sources of 
information, and Appendix D lists still other sources. When posting a forum 
question, just write that you are a newbie and want to know whether anyone 
has had any experience using Ubuntu with the board (or other hardware) in 
question. You will probably get quite a few responses. Linux users are usually 
rather evangelical in terms of trying to draw in new Penguinistas.

Hardware Requirements
All worries about compatibility aside, you will need to meet some minimum 
hardware requirements:
z
Any computer with a 1 GHz or higher i386-based processor, or an Intel 
or AMD 64-bit processor
z
About 5 gigabytes (GB) of hard disk space, though having at least 10GB 
would be a bit more comfy
z
Sufficient memory (RAM)
NOTE
The CD that comes with this book is designed to work on machines with i386-based pro-
cessors (basically, all the Pentium chips, including Celeron, Xeon, and the new Core 
Duo, as well as processors from AMD). Though this CD will install Ubuntu on a computer 
with an AMD or Intel 64-bit processor, it will run in 32-bit mode only. To make full use 
of your 64-bit processor, you need to download the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Additional 
information is provided in Appendix B.
As for random access memory (RAM), the official specs tell you that you 
need a minimum of 512 megabytes (MB) to run Ubuntu. Although you can 
no doubt get by with this, you’d get by much better with more. My basic rule 
of thumb, no matter what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recom-
mended (not the minimum) memory plus at least 128MB. Regardless of what 
the official specs say, put in more. You won’t regret it. 
Saying “the more memory you have, the better” may sound a bit simple, 
and perhaps even cavalier, but trust me on this one. When you have too little 
memory, no matter what system you are running, weird things happen: Appli-
cations seem to take years to open or don’t open at all, menus take forever to 
render their little icons, and freezes and general system meltdowns just happen 
much more often. In other words, running your machine on too little RAM is 
sort of like trying to do jumping jacks in a broom closet. Sure, you could do 
it, but you would be all contorted, and you’d be smashing your hands into 
the walls every 1.4 seconds. 
Fortunately, it is pretty hard to find a machine with less than 512MB of 
RAM these days (256MB, perhaps, on the really old beasties), but if you do 
happen to have such a machine, you can at least take solace in the fact that 
memory is relatively cheap, so go for it.
Good News for 64-Bit Machine Users
It is again important to mention that the CD that comes with this book is 
designed to work on machines with i386-based processors, which pretty much 
covers the vast majority of PCs out there. If your machine is 64-bit compatible, 
you will be glad to know that it will also work, albeit not in 64-bit mode. Sorry, 
but no go. 

10
Chapter 1
Fortunately, there is good news for those of you who were a bit disappointed 
by the content of that previous paragraph. Ubuntu is available in a native 64-bit 
version. Check Appendix B for information on how to get it. The informa-
tion provided there will also be of use to i386 users who happen to lose or 
damage the disc that comes with this book.
Mixed News for Mac Users
Those of you with pre–Intel era PowerPC Macs (such as those with G3, G4, and 
G5 processors) may be aware that previous Ubuntu releases have been avail-
able in PowerPC versions. Unfortunately, as of the Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn 
release, this is no longer the case. This means that if you are a PowerPC Mac 
user, you will have to use one of the older Ubuntu releases or use an unofficial, 
community-supported release of Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx (more on that name 
in the following section) for PowerPCs (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/).
Of course, if you are using an Intel-based Mac, you’re in luck: The disc 
that comes with this book will work on your Mac. After all, the i in i386 stands 
for “Intel.”
Speaking Ubuntu
It’s worth noting that you are bound to come across a lot of weird phrases 
when dealing with Ubuntu, especially when searching for information on the 
Net. In particular, I am referring to seemingly incongruous phrases, such as 
Warty Warthog, Hoary Hedgehog, Breezy Badger, Dapper Drake, Edgy Eft, Feisty Fawn, 
Gutsy Gibbon, Hardy Heron, Intrepid Ibex, Jaunty Jackalope, and Karmic Koala. 
These are the unlikely code names of each of the releases of Ubuntu since its 
first appearance in 2004. The important one for you to remember is that of 
the current release, which is the one on the book’s disc: version 10.04, 
known as Lucid Lynx.
You are also likely to come across a few other variations of the Ubuntu 
theme. These are Kubuntu, a KDE-based version of Ubuntu; Edubuntu, a 
special version of Ubuntu designed for use in the classroom; Xubuntu, a 
lightweight version of Ubuntu based on the XFCE desktop; and Ubuntu Studio, 
a new flavor of Ubuntu, aimed at “creative people,” which contains a strong 
suite of graphics, video, and music applications. There’s even a slimmed-
down version of Ubuntu, called Ubuntu Netbook Edition, designed specifi-
cally for netbooks. 
Where Do I Go from Here?
Now that you know more about the world of Linux and Ubuntu and you have 
your disc in hand, it’s time to get down to it. If you have already installed 
Ubuntu on your machine, just flip ahead to Chapter 3. If your machine is still 
Linuxless, though, it’s time to take it out for a spin and see whether you like 
it. So for now, strap yourself down in front of that computer, clip on your 
spurs, and go straight to the next chapter. It’s time to become a Penguinista!

Running and (If You Like) Installing Ubuntu
As I have already mentioned, one of the 
great things about Ubuntu is that it comes 
on a live CD, which means that you can try it 
before you install it . . . or never install it at all, 
if that’s what you prefer. Better yet is the fact that, unlike 
earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don’t need an additional
installation CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu Desktop CD func-
tions as both a live CD and an install CD. And in the good-better-best swing 
of things, the best point of all is that installation from the live CD is actually 
much, much easier than any other installation process you’ve ever dealt with, 
and it even gives you more than one way to go about it.
In this chapter, I will cover the basics of starting up and running Ubuntu 
from the live CD and then, assuming you’ve caught the Linux bug, the pain-
less steps of installing Ubuntu on your hard disk as your sole operating system, 
in its own partition on your hard disk in a traditional dual-boot setup (with 
Windows in its own partition), or, for the slightly less adventurous, from within 
your Windows system. If your computer doesn’t have a CD drive, don’t worry, 

12
Chapter 2
you can still join in—take a look at Appendix A to see how you can run or 
install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive instead. Whatever way you end up 
going about things, let’s put this book to use and get Ubuntu up and running.
Going for a Dip
To get a taste of what Ubuntu is all about (and to check out your hardware to 
see whether it’s all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way 
to go than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the 
Ubuntu Desktop CD in your disc drive and restart your machine. When the 
machine starts up, it should boot up from the CD, and after a second or two, 
you should see a purple Ubuntu startup screen with a couple of icons at the 
bottom of it. If the screen does not appear and your machine instead boots 
up into your usual operating system, then it is very likely that your machine’s 
BIOS settings need to be changed to allow you to boot from a CD.
You can access your machine’s BIOS by restarting and then pressing what-
ever key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS setup. 
This is usually DELETE or F1 (F2, F10, and ESC are also common), but not all 
machines are the same. If the onscreen information passes by so fast that you 
miss it, you can check your user’s manual to see what the correct key is. Once you 
get into the BIOS setup, change the boot sequence so that your CD drive is first.
Once your machine boots from the live CD and you see the purple 
Ubuntu startup screen, either you can wait for a few seconds for Ubuntu to start 
booting into the live CD proper or you can press a key (any key) to display a 
menu where you can choose your language and other settings. The default set-
tings should suffice for our purposes, so leave the keyboard untouched for a few 
seconds, and the purple screen will give way to a loading screen (also purple).
After a couple of minutes or so, the loading screen will disappear, and in 
its place will come an Install window like the one in Figure 2-1. You should 
now be able to use your mouse as well as the keyboard, so unless you want 
to change the language using the list on the left of the screen, click the Try 
Ubuntu 10.04 button to start a live session. After a few more seconds of load-
ing, you’ll be presented with an Ubuntu desktop, all run from the CD. And 
remember, your hard disk will go untouched, so rest easy—you’re not going 
to change, let alone hurt, anything. When you get to this point, you’re ready 
to roll—but I’ll hold off on talking about that until Chapter 3.
NOTE
Special input mechanisms that are required for typing certain languages (that is, 
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are not supported in live CD sessions.
If you’d like to get out of the live CD and return your computer to normal, 
click the power button at the top right of the screen, choose Restart, and 
then choose Restart again from the window that appears. After a little while, 
you’ll be asked to remove the CD from the drive and press ENTER. The com-
puter will restart and return you to your normal Windows desktop soon after. 
If you have no luck with the Restart button for some reason, it should be safe 
to just turn your computer off and then on again using the power button on 
the front of it.

Choices, Choices, Choices—Installation Options
If you have already installed Ubuntu on your machine, are satisfied running 
it from the live CD, or still haven’t made up your mind what to do, you can 
skip the rest of this chapter and continue to the next one to get started work-
ing with the Ubuntu desktop. If, however, you haven’t installed Ubuntu yet 
and are ready and rarin’ to do so, then you had better stay right where you 
are and continue reading. 
Going for a Swim—Installing Ubuntu Inside Windows (the Wubi Installer)
It used to be that if you enjoyed Ubuntu enough to want to run it off your 
hard disk but were afraid to do it for fear of damaging the delicate state of 
your Windows setup, you were . . . well, out of luck. Things have changed, 
however, because there is now an installation option called Wubi that lets you 
install Ubuntu directly on your Windows C: drive as if it were any other Windows 
program. Once installed, every time you start up your machine, you will be 
able to choose between starting up into Windows or into Ubuntu from the 
Windows bootloader screen. Your Windows system stays as it is; you don’t have 
to partition your hard disk; and if you want to get rid of Ubuntu later for what-
ever reason, you can do so like you would with any other Windows application. 
It’s a great way to go about things for the faint of heart.

14
Chapter 2
Admittedly, this approach could be described as a half measure, in that it 
doesn’t really give you the full experience you would normally get from a 
dedicated Ubuntu installation. It also takes longer to install, because Wubi 
needs to download the installation files from the Internet (the right ones 
aren’t on the CD). But it is a pretty good compromise—it definitely runs 
quicker and is much, much more usable and enjoyable than an Ubuntu live 
CD session. You also have the added benefit of being able to save files and 
settings to disk, which means you can follow along with anything described in 
this book. Pretty cool.
If this alternative installation approach doesn’t seem appealing to you, 
move on to “Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Win-
dows” on page 16. If you haven’t made up your mind yet and would like to 
know a bit more about this Wubi installer, point your browser to http://
wubi-installer.org/. If, on the other hand, you’ve decided that the Wubi 
installer is the answer to your prayers, here’s what you need to do: Insert 
the Ubuntu live CD that comes with this book into your computer’s disc 
drive while Windows is up and running. A window like the one in Figure 2-2 
will automatically appear.
Figure 2-2: An Ubuntu live CD automatically launched in Windows
1.
In that window, click the Install inside Windows button. The Ubuntu 
Installer window will appear (Figure 2-3).
2.
Use the Installation drive option to specify where you want the Ubuntu 
files to be put. Make sure you have enough space on that drive!
3.
Windows and Linux can’t share the same disk space, so you need to set 
some aside for use by Ubuntu only (you can easily reclaim the space by 
uninstalling Ubuntu, discussed in a moment). Choose how much disk 
space you’d like to have available in Ubuntu by selecting a size from the 
Installation size drop-down list. Anything less than 6GB will probably be 
very restrictive.

4.
Leave the Desktop environment set to its default value (Ubuntu), and 
then choose a username and a password. Click the Install button once 
you’re happy with your choices.

5.
If your machine is not already connected to the Internet at this point, 
you will be told to get it connected. Do so if you need to, and click the 
Retry button if the warning window appears.
At this point, Wubi will begin downloading the files it needs in order 
to create a bootable Ubuntu installation within your Windows environment. 
Depending on your connection speed, this could take quite some time.
After all is done, you will see a window like the one in Figure 2-4 
asking you to reboot. 
Figure 2-4: Ubuntu has completed the first phase of its inside-Windows installation.

6.
Select Reboot now and click the Finish button in that window, after which 
your machine will reboot.
7.
When the machine restarts, you will see the Windows bootloader, a black 
screen with white text, which allows you to decide whether to boot up in 
Windows or in Ubuntu. Use your down arrow key to select Ubuntu, and 
then press ENTER.
Your machine will then begin the Ubuntu startup process, which should 
be new territory for you. Once the Ubuntu desktop appears, Ubuntu will get 
to work setting things up for you, which might take a bit of time, depending 
on the speed of your machine. When it’s done, you will be delivered to the 
login screen (Figure 2-5); you can now flip to Chapter 3, because you are 
done here.
If you decide that you do not want to keep Ubuntu on your machine, you 
can remove it from within Windows by going to the Windows Control Panel, 
selecting Add or Remove Programs, and then selecting Wubi for removal.

Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows
If you don’t already have Windows installed on your machine, you can skip 
this section. If you do, then you are going to have to decide whether you want 
to keep it.
It is possible to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same 
machine and for them to happily coexist. This is known as a dual-boot setup. 
It has also become incredibly easy to set up such a system. I started out with a 

Wading and Diving
17
dual-boot setup, though I eventually found that I used the Linux side of things 
exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I 
didn’t use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped 
the whole thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup.
My feeling is that you should try the Wubi route of installing Ubuntu 
inside Windows first and then, when you’re ready, go for a Linux-only setup 
and ditch Windows completely. Most people find that Ubuntu can do every-
thing they need, so there’s no need to dual-boot unless you require some 
specific application that has no equivalent on Linux.
If you do opt for a dual-boot setup, starting up in either system is easy. 
When you start up your machine, you will be greeted by the GRand Unified 
Bootloader (better known as GRUB) screen, from which you can choose to 
continue booting up Linux or choose Windows instead. After that, bootup 
proceeds as normal for the system you selected. This setup works fine and is 
easy to use, so you needn’t worry.
So as you see, either way you decide to go, you can’t really go wrong. Just 
be sure to back up your important files before starting the installation. Pro-
ceed with common sense, patience, and a positive attitude, and you’ll be fine. In 
short, don’t worry. 
Getting Ready for Action
There is less you need to do to prepare for an Ubuntu installation than for 
many other Linux distributions. Once you’ve decided whether you want to 
go the dual-boot route, all you really need to have on hand is your single 
Ubuntu Desktop CD and, for guidance and security, this book. The only 
mental energy you’ll probably need to expend is to come up with a username 
and user password, just as you do for most other operating systems.
Usernames and User Passwords
Your username is something that you will be seeing quite a bit. You will need 
to click it every time you boot up your system, among other things, so be sure 
it is something you can live with. It can be just your first name or your initials 
or whatever you want it to be. It must, however, begin with a lowercase letter, 
followed by numbers and/or other lowercase letters. Mine, for example, is 
simply rg, but you could use something like hope4u2pal, though that would 
get rather tiring to look at.
You also need to come up with a user password, which you will need to 
type every time you log in. You will need to use it when you install new soft-
ware or change certain system settings, as well. It should be a minimum of 
eight characters in length and consist of numbers and letters (upper- and 
lowercase) for improved security. You can, of course, get by with fewer char-
acters and only letters if you prefer. The installer will advise you if the password 
you enter is unacceptable, so don’t worry too much. Be sure to write it down 
and keep the paper you’ve written it on in a safe place so you don’t end up 
locking yourself out of your system.

18
Chapter 2
NOTE
If you have experience working with other Linux distributions, you may be surprised 
to learn that the root account is disabled by default in Ubuntu. There is, therefore, no 
installation step for inputting a root password. You can check the forums (http://
www.ubuntuforums.org/) to learn ways of getting around this setup. You can also 
set up a root password later at any time after the system is installed, so if having a root 
account is important to you, don’t worry.
Dual-Booters Take Note
If you are going to be creating a dual-boot setup, it is a good idea to first defrag-
ment your current Windows disk before moving on to installing Ubuntu. 
This step isn’t strictly necessary, but it can make the repartitioning phase of the 
installation process a little faster, and it helps guard against unwanted surprises. 
If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, your system is set up by 
default to automatically defragment your hard disk on a regular basis, so you 
should be good to go without any additional effort on your part. On other 
versions of Windows, however, you’ll have to defragment your disk manually. 
In Windows XP, you can do this by double-clicking My Computer, right-clicking 
the icon for your hard disk, and selecting Properties. You can then defragment 
your hard disk by clicking the Tools tab in the Properties window and clicking 
the Defragment Now button. In Windows 2000, you can do this by going to 
the Start menu and selecting Control PanelAdministrative ToolsComputer 
ManagementDisk Defragmenter, while in Windows 98 and some other 
versions, you can do the same by selecting ProgramsAccessoriesSystem 
ToolsDisk Defragmenter. Defragmenting can take quite a while, so you 
might want to leave it running overnight.
Doing the Deed
Well, now that I’ve covered all that preliminary stuff, let’s get down to the 
actual Linux installation. Set this book on your lap so you can follow along, 
and then get ready for action. It’s time to do the deed!
Fortunately for you, the installation process is extremely easy, because 
there are very few steps in which you actually have to do anything. Most of 
what you will be doing is clicking buttons on your screen. Nothing hard about 
that, eh?
Of course, when you look at the directions and descriptions listed here, 
it may look like a long and cumbersome process. It is not. It will be over more 
quickly than you can imagine. As a beginner frequently referring to this text, 
you might take a bit longer, of course, but all in all, the whole process is 
faster and easier than that for Windows or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that 
with Windows and OS X you are installing the operating system with just a 
few bundled applications. In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, you 
are installing not only the operating system itself but also most of the applica-
tions you will ever want or need to use. You will thus be getting a lot done in 
one fell swoop.

One more thing before we start. Some people approach installing a sys-
tem with a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as if 
the house is going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing somewhere 
along the line. Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as 
you have backed up your data, you will be OK. If you screw up the installation 
the first time out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, because you 
have nothing to harm. Just make sure that you give yourself more time than 
you need for the process. Don’t start installing one hour before you have to 
be at work or before you have to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes 
people do weird things. Make things easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty 
of time and, as I mentioned before, by backing up any data you would mourn 
the loss of.
If you’re ready, here are the steps:
1.
Start ’er up. If you haven’t already done so, boot up your machine from 
the Ubuntu Desktop CD.
2.
Start the installation. This time, when you get to the Install window shown 
in Figure 2-1, click the Install Ubuntu 10.04 button to start the installa-
tion. This will open the first page of the installation wizard, Where are 
you? (Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-6: Selecting your location from the Where are you? screen
3.
Choose your location. The Ubuntu installer will select the default loca-
tion for the installation language you have chosen. If your location is 
different, select the one appropriate for you by clicking the map directly. 
Once you’ve made your selection, click Forward.

20
Chapter 2
4.
Select a keyboard layout. The default keyboard layout for the installation 
language you have chosen will appear on the next wizard screen. If your 
keyboard layout is different, select Choose your own, make the appropriate 
choice from the location list in the left pane of the screen, and then 
choose from among the available layouts for that location in the right 
pane. If you’re not sure you’ve made the right choice, you can double-
check by typing a few words in the text box at the bottom of the window. 
Once you’ve done this, click Forward. If need be, you can add other key-
board layouts later, after the system is installed.
5.
Prepare disk space. What you do at this point depends on what you have 
on your machine. Assuming you have an operating system on the disk 
already, such as Windows, accept the uppermost option (Install them side 
by side). This will reduce the size of your Windows (or other OS) installa-
tion to allow for installation of Ubuntu in a new partition. By default, the 
partitioner will use the minimum amount of space necessary to install 
Ubuntu, but you will no doubt want a bit more so as to give yourself room 
to grow and store files. To create a bigger partition for Ubuntu, drag the 
gray button between the two partitions on the colored bar at the bottom 
of the screen until you come up with a combination that you think will 
work for you (Figure 2-7). Once done, click the Forward button.
If you have no operating system on your hard disk or if you intend to 
eliminate what you currently have and replace it with Ubuntu, you should 
instead choose the second option, Erase and use the entire disk; then, 
if given a choice, select the main drive onto which you want to install 
the system.
Figure 2-7: Partitioning your hard disk (or not) to make way for Ubuntu

Wading and Diving
21
If you’d like to do something more elaborate with your disk space, 
such as having separate partitions for your data and system files (conve-
nient if you ever need to reinstall or want to easily share files between 
Windows and Ubuntu), you’ll need to specify the partitions manually 
using the last option. This is more advanced—check out Appendix C for 
some guidance. Once your selection is made, click Forward.
Depending on the partitioning scheme you chose, once you’ve clicked 
the Forward button, a small window may appear reminding you that any 
changes you’ve made thus far will now be written to disk (Figure 2-8).
Figure 2-8: A warning that the changes you’ve 
requested are about to be made permanent
6.
Click the Continue button, keeping in mind that, if you saw the warning 
message, this is the point of no return. After that, wait for the partitioner 
to do its stuff (depending on the size of your disk and what you have on 
it, this could take some time).
WHAT IS A HARD DRIVE PARTITION?
I’ve mentioned partitions several times so far, but it may not be obvious to you what 
I meant. A partition is an area of your hard disk that is “cordoned off” from other 
areas of the disk. It’s a useful way of keeping things such as operating systems sepa-
rate. Because they are isolated from each other, different partitions are treated as if 
they are different hard disks attached to your computer, even though they’re on the 
same physical hard disk.
Most computers have just one partition that fills up the entire hard disk. This is 
like having a house with a completely open floor plan—the whole house is just one 
big room. If you want to completely remove Windows and install Ubuntu instead, 
Ubuntu can happily take over the entire partition (and thus the entire disk) and kick 
out its former resident, Windows.
If you want to install two operating systems on the same computer, you have to 
give each one its own partition (after all, they need their privacy). Back with the 
house analogy, it’s l ke erecting a partition wall to carve up the house into two rooms. If 
you choose to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, the installer will automatically do this 
partitioning for you. Of course, you can choose how big each partition is: The big-
ger you make the Ubuntu partition, the more disk space will be available to you in 
Ubuntu (and the less in Windows). After all, the house is the same size; it’s just the 
position of the dividing wall that you’re changing.
You can find some information on manually partitioning your hard disk in Appen-
dix C, if you fancy taking control of the process yourself. There should be no need 
to, however, since the Ubuntu installer will be happy to handle the task for you.

Specify who you are. On the next page of the installation wizard, you are 
asked to provide your real name, your login name, and a password. The 
wizard will automatically generate a name for your computer based on 
your username (rg-laptop in my case), but you are free to change this to 
something else if you like (I changed mine to Ubuntu-Acer). Once you’ve 
filled in all the fields, as I’ve done in Figure 2-9, click Forward. If you’re 
warned that your password is too weak, go back and add a few extra char-
acters to it and try again (or just ignore the message and click Continue).
NOTE
The security-conscious among you might consider selecting the Require my password 
to log in and to decrypt my home folder option at the bottom of the window. This will 
encrypt your home folder (where all your documents are stored) so that no one can see 
any of the files in it without your password. This is nice to have if you work with confi-
dential information, since the data will be pretty safe even if your computer is stolen.
Figure 2-9: Providing your username, password, and computer name in the 
installation wizard

Migrate documents and settings. If your machine already has another 
operating system on it and you are setting up a dual-boot system, the 
installer will scan your hard disk to try to find certain settings, folders, 
and documents that it can transfer to your new Ubuntu system environ-
ment. If a migration window appears, just check the boxes next to the 
items you want to transfer, and then click Forward.

Get ready to install. The final page of the wizard (Figure 2-10) lists the 
details of your soon-to-be installed system and hard disk partition setup, 
along with a point-of-no-return warning. You’ve come this far, so you 
might as well go for it, even though there’s no turning back (if you saw 
the warning message in Figure 2-8, that is). Click Install.
Figure 2-10: Ready to install—the final page of the installation wizard
The partitioner will then do whatever writing to disk it must do in 
order to finish the partitioning process, after which the installation itself 
will seamlessly begin, without any additional input necessary from you. 
The progress of the installation will be indicated in progress windows 
along with a brief slide show so that you don’t have to fret (and so you’ll 
know how much more time you have left to “veg out” in front of the TV).
10. The installation is complete. When you’ve come to the end of the first 
phase of the installation, you will be notified in a new window. You are 
given the option of either continuing to use the live CD or restarting the 
machine and running Ubuntu directly from your hard disk. Well, you 
didn’t go through all of this just to keep using the live CD, so let’s go for 
the second option by clicking the Restart now button, removing the live 
CD from your drive when it is automatically ejected, and pressing ENTER 
when prompted to do so. Your machine will then restart.

Chapter 2
After that . . . well, that’s basically it. You now have Ubuntu installed on 
your machine. Congratulations!
How Can I Get Back into Windows?
If you installed your system in a dual-boot configuration, with Ubuntu along-
side Windows, you should see a new boot menu appear when the computer 
starts up. After 10 seconds Ubuntu will boot up automatically, but you can 
just hit ENTER to speed up the process.
If you want to start Windows instead, use your keyboard’s arrow keys to 
select the Windows option in the boot menu, and then hit ENTER. Windows 
should start as normal. Take a look at Chapter 18 if you want to make Windows 
the default or change the boot time delay.
Oh No, My Computer Won’t Boot!
If the installation process fails, you may not be able to boot your computer. 
Thankfully this is very rare, but if it happens to you, don’t panic! There’s 
plenty you can do to get up and running again, so flip your way to Chapter 21 
for some troubleshooting advice.

Getting to Know the Desktop
Now Ubuntu is up and running, and you are 
ready and rarin’ to go. If you are running 
Ubuntu from your hard disk, you will first 
see the login screen that will appear each and 
every time you boot up (Figure 3-1). There’s no need 
to keep the login screen waiting, so click your username, 
type your password, and press ENTER. Within moments, 
you will be face to face with your desktop in Ubuntu.
Welcome to the GNOME Desktop
Figure 3-2 shows Ubuntu’s implementation of the GNOME desktop, and as 
you can see, it isn’t all that different from what you might be used to in a 
Windows or Mac OS environment, other than that it has taskbars, or panels, 
at both the top and the bottom of the screen. There are also no desktop 
icons, except when running a live session from the Ubuntu Desktop CD, in 
which case you’ll see a launcher to run the installation wizard (labeled Install 
Ubuntu 10.04) and an Examples folder, which contains a number of sample

Chapter 3
Figure 3-1: The Ubuntu login screen
files for many of the applications that come bundled with Ubuntu. All in all, 
it is a very uncluttered place to be, and despite its superficial similarities to 
other OS desktop environments, things in the GNOME are different enough 
to be interesting.
The main elements of the GNOME desktop are the panels at the top and 
bottom of the screen and the icons that appear upon those panels. The desk-
top itself, although empty at startup, does see its share of action, but I’ll come 
to that later. For now, I’ll focus on the two panels.
Figure 3-2: The GNOME desktop in Ubuntu

A New Place to Call Home
27
The Top Panel
Of the two GNOME panels on your desktop, the top panel is basically where 
all the action is. As you can see, there are three menus and a few icons at the 
left end of the panel and a number of odds and ends at the other end (Fig-
ure 3-3). So that you understand what each of the panel items does, I will 
now briefly describe each of them, moving from left to right, as seems to be 
the fashion these days.
Figure 3-3: The left and right sides of the top GNOME panel
The Left End
At the far left of the top panel, you will find a set of three menus. These menus 
provide access to most of what your system has to offer in terms of applica-
tions, locations, and utilities:
Applications menu
The access point to the majority of your applications, 
a software manager, and some system tools
Places menu
Your system navigator, from which you can access your 
home folder, browse your computer’s filesystem and connected net-
works, and search for files on your hard disk
System menu
The access point for your system preferences and admin-
istration tools
Immediately to the right of the three menus is a set of two launchers. 
When these icons are clicked, they launch the following applications:
Firefox
Your web browser
Help
Access to the Ubuntu Help files installed on your hard disk
The Right End
At the right side of the top panel are a series of icons that can perform a variety 
of functions. Some of these are indicators, while others are applets that allow 
you to perform certain functions:
Network Manager Applet
Lets you see your network status and configure 
your network devices. When used with a wireless network connection, this 
icon indicates the wireless signal’s strength and allows you to switch between 
wireless networks easily.
Volume Control
A volume controller. Duh.

28
Chapter 3
Mail/Message Indicator
An indicator that lets you know when you 
receive email or chat messages. It also allows you to easily send email 
messages, check your address book, and even check and send messages 
to social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, via an 
application called Gwibber (Figure 3-4), which you’ll learn more about 
in Chapter 5.
Figure 3-4: Gwibber allows you to see and send messages on 
social networking sites.
Calendar/Clock
Date and time and weather.
Session Indicator
Shows the name of the current user and allows you 
to change your IM status and access the options for your social networks, 
IMs, and Ubuntu One. 
Quit/Logout
Allows you to lock your screen, log out, shut down, restart, 
or switch users.

A New Place to Call Home
29
Other indicators will appear depending on your hardware configuration 
or system status:
Bluetooth Manager
As the name implies. This appears only on machines 
with Bluetooth capabilities.
Battery Indicator
On laptops, shows whether you are using battery or 
line power and, if battery, the amount of power your battery has remaining.
The Bottom Panel
The  bottom panel, as you can see in Figure 3-5, is a much simpler affair, con-
taining only the four items I will now briefly describe:
Show Desktop
A button that minimizes all open windows and allows 
you to see your desktop when it is obscured from view.
Window List
A list of windows or applications you have open. If nothing 
is open, there will be no windows in the list. This is very similar to what 
happens in the Windows taskbar.
Workspace Switcher
An application that allows you to switch between 
virtual desktops. (I’ll talk about this more in “Virtual Desktops” on page 40.)
Trash
There is nothing mysterious about the Trash . . . other than its 
rather Mac OS X–ish location on the panel.
Figure 3-5: The bottom GNOME panel
The GNOME panel is not a static thing. You can add launchers (respectively 
known as program shortcuts or aliases to Windows and Mac users), utilities, and 
even amusements to make it do almost anything you want—within limits, of 
course. In the various stages of this project, you will customize your panel to 
get some hands-on experience working with it and to make things more con-
venient for you as you make your way through the rest of this book. You are, 
of course, free to change any of the customizations I ask you to make (though 
you won’t have a say in the matter if you’re working in a live session from the 
Ubuntu Desktop CD, because you won’t be able to save your settings).
Each of the following subprojects is very simple. Most are only three-
step, point-and-click procedures that you should be able to handle without 
any difficulty.
Project 3A: Customizing the GNOME Panel

Chapter 3
3A-1: Adding Utility Buttons to the Panel
The GNOME panel allows you to add a number of utility applications, known 
as applets. Each of these has some specific function, such as tracking your stocks, 
telling you the weather, or performing some particular system-related func-
tion. To start, let’s add a useful utility to the top panel: the Force Quit but-
ton. The Force Quit button lets you quickly and easily deal with non-
responding windows.
Yes, it does happen on occasion: A window suddenly refuses to do anything. 
Regardless of what you want it to do or what it is supposed to be doing, it just 
sits there as if it is on strike (maybe it is). With just one click of the Force Quit 
button, your cursor becomes a powerful surgical instrument that will kill the 
window you click. You definitely don’t want to be without this button, so here’s 
how to add it to the panel:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the pop-up menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to 
Panel window will appear.
3.
In that window, scroll down, and click Force Quit once to highlight it, as 
I’ve done in Figure 3-6. Click the Add button, and then click Close to 
finish the job.
Figure 3-6: Adding launchers and utility applets to the panel

A New Place to Call Home
31
To reinforce what you’ve just learned how to do, let’s add another utility 
to the panel: the Run Application applet. Once you start installing applications 
in Ubuntu, you will find that some of those applications do not automatically 
install program launchers in your Applications menu. This means that you 
have to open a Terminal window and type a command every time you want to 
run such programs, which can get old rather fast. The Run Application applet 
is one way around this problem.
To add the Run Application applet to the panel, just follow the same 
steps you used when adding the Force Quit button, but this time in Step 3, 
highlight Run Application in the Add to Panel window instead of Force Quit. 
NOTE
If you later decide not to keep the Run Application applet on the panel or if you just prefer 
keyboard shortcuts to pointing and clicking, it is worth noting that you can also open 
the applet by pressing ALT-F2.
3A-2: Adding Amusing Applets to the Panel
The GNOME panel not only allows you to add very functional utilities, but it 
allows you to add quite seemingly useless amusements as well. In this part 
of the project, you will be adding two such amusements: Eyes and a little fish 
called Wanda.
At first glance, Wanda does little more than bat her tail around and spurt 
out a bubble or two. However, if you install a little application called Fortune 
via the Ubuntu Software Center, which you will learn how to use in Chapter 6, 
and then click Wanda, a window pops up in which she will spew out quotes and 
offbeat one-liners.
To get a glimpse of Wanda in action, limited though that action may be, 
the steps are essentially the same as those in Project 3A-1, but I’ll run through 
them one more time:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the pop-up menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to Panel 
window will appear.
3.
In that window, click Fish once to highlight it, click the Add button, and 
then click Close.
With Wanda now in place on your panel, you can add Eyes, which is a 
pair of eyes that follows your mouse cursor around as it moves around your 
desktop. Follow the same procedure, but click Eyes instead of Fish in Step 3.
3A-3: Adding a Program Launcher to the Panel
Now let’s move on to something a bit more practical—adding program launch-
ers to the panel. Although it is very easy to run an application by navigating 
through the Applications menu, there are no doubt some applications that 
you will be using frequently enough to want even easier access to them. The 
OpenOffice.org word processor, Writer, is probably one of those applications.

32
Chapter 3
Method 1
You can add a launcher to the panel in a number of ways, but let’s start with 
the most conventional. To add a panel launcher for OpenOffice.org Writer, 
follow these steps:
1.
Right-click any open space within the top panel.
2.
Select Add to Panel in the pop-up menu to open the Add to Panel 
window.
3.
In that window, select Application Launcher, and click the Forward button 
that then appears.
4.
A new screen will then appear, showing the contents of the Applications 
menu (Figure 3-7). Click the + next to Office to expand that menu, 
and then scroll down and click OpenOffice.org Word Processor to 
highlight it.
5.
Click the Add button, and then click Close to complete the process.
Figure 3-7: Adding an application launcher to the panel
Method 2
There’s another way to add program launchers to the panel that is actually 
a tad quicker. As an example, you’ll add a launcher for the OpenOffice.org 
spreadsheet program, Calc. Here are the steps:
1.
Go to the Applications menu, and navigate your way to and right-click 
OfficeOpenOffice.org Spreadsheet.

A New Place to Call Home
33
2.
In the pop-up menu that then appears, select (that’s the usual ol’ click) 
Add this launcher to panel (Figure 3-8). The spreadsheet launcher will 
then appear in the panel.
Figure 3-8: Another way to add application launchers to the panel
Method 3
Now that you’ve learned two ways to add application launchers to the panel, 
I might as well let you in on a third, even easier method. Just open a menu, 
select the item you want to add to the panel, and then drag it there. Well, it 
can’t get much easier than that, eh?
3A-4: Changing Panel Launcher Icons
You may think your two new program launchers are somewhat plain, and 
therefore, it is rather difficult to distinguish one from the other. Fortunately, 
you can change the icon for any launcher quite easily. To learn how to do it, 
I’ll address any immediate concerns with the two OpenOffice.org launchers. 
Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Right-click the first program launcher you added (the word processor), 
and select Properties from the pop-up menu.
2.
In the Launcher Properties window that then appears, click the 
OpenOffice.org Word Processor icon, which will open a Choose an icon 
window.

34
Chapter 3
3.
In that window, click the Browse button to open the Browse window.
4.
At the top of that window, click the icons button. In the right pane, double-
click the hicolor folder, double-click the 48x48 folder within the hicolor 
folder, and then double-click the apps folder within the 48x48 folder.
5.
Scroll down in that window and click openofficeorg3-writer.png once 
(Figure 3-9).
Figure 3-9: Selecting a new panel launcher icon
6.
Click the Open button in that window, which will close it.
7.
You will then be back at the Launcher Properties window, which should 
now look like Figure 3-10. If so, click Close.
Figure 3-10: A Launcher Properties window
Once you have completed the transformation, follow essentially the same 
steps for the word processor launcher, but this time around you should select 
openofficeorg3-calc.png as the icon in Step 3.

3A-5: Adding a Drawer to the Panel
One of the features I quite like about the GNOME panel is the drawer. The 
drawer is a little applet that saves on panel space by letting you add drop-
down panels, in which you can place launchers that you do not have room to 
place elsewhere. These drawers are also handy locations to place launchers 
for applications that you must normally run by typing a command in a Terminal 
window or via the Launch Application window, such as those you compile 
yourself from source code or that are run via scripts. You’ll learn how to do 
this in Chapter 9. Of course, you can put anything you want in a drawer, includ-
ing frequently used files or even whole menus.
Adding a drawer to your panel is very easy and is basically the same pro-
cedure that you used to add the Force Quit button to the panel. Here is all 
you need to do:
1.
Right-click any open space on the top panel.
2.
From the pop-up menu, select Add to Panel, after which the Add to Panel 
window will appear.
3.
In that window, click Drawer once to highlight it, and then click the Add 
button. Close the window by, quite logically, clicking Close.
3A-6: Adding Program Launchers to the Drawer
The drawer you’ve just added is empty at this stage, so let’s put it to good use 
by adding launchers for three useful, yet less glamorous, system utilities. These 
are System Monitor, which allows you to view your computer’s running appli-
cations and processes, memory and CPU usage, and storage device usage; 
Terminal, in which you can type and execute commands (slightly geeky, I 
admit, but very useful); and the Ubuntu Software Center, which you can use 
to download and install applications.
Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Right-click the drawer applet in the panel, and select Add to Drawer in 
the pop-up menu.
2.
In the Add to Drawer window that then appears (and looks and behaves 
the same as the Add to Panel window), select Application Launcher, and 
then click the Forward button that appears.
3.
On the next screen, click the small + next to Accessories, scroll down and 
click Terminal to select it, and then click the Add button. The Terminal 
launcher will now be loaded into the drawer.
4.
Next, scroll way down and click the small arrow next to Administration.
5.
Scroll down within that category until you find Ubuntu Software Center, 
click it to select, and then click Add.
6.
Finally, add a launcher for the System Monitor by scrolling down to the 
System Tools category, clicking the small + next to that category, select-
ing System Monitor from within that group, and then clicking Add. You 
can now close the Add to Drawer window.

36
Chapter 3
3A-7: Adding the Entire Contents of a Menu to the Panel
If you find that you use the applications in a particular submenu of your 
Applications, Places, or System menus a lot, you can opt to add the entire 
menu to the panel either as a menu or as a drawer in a manner similar to 
the one you used in Project 3A-3’s “Method 2” section on page 32. To learn 
how to do this, let’s add the Games submenu to the panel as a menu and 
the Sound & Video submenu as a drawer. Here is what you need to do:
The three launchers should now be 
loaded in the drawer, so click the drawer to 
sneak a peek. Yours should look the same as 
mine in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11: Launchers 
in a panel drawer
1.
Add the Games menu to the 
panel by selecting Applica-
tionsGames and then right-
clicking any of the launchers 
within that submenu.
2.
In the pop-up menu that 
appears, select Entire menu
Add this as menu to panel.
3.
Add the Sound & Video sub-
menu to the panel as a drawer by 
selecting ApplicationsSound 
& Video and then right-clicking 
any of the launchers you find 
there.
4.
In the pop-up menu, select 
Entire menuAdd this as 
drawer to panel.
You should now have two new 
launchers on your panel with icons 
matching those found in the Appli-
cations menu next to the relevant 
items. As you can see in Figure 3-12, 
these two icons act somewhat 
differently.
Figure 3-12: Adding menus to the panel

37
3A-8: Moving Things Around on the Panel
Well, now you’ve added all you are going to be adding to the panel in this 
chapter. It may seem a little messy up there right now, so let’s do a bit of 
housekeeping by moving things around. You will try to group things together 
somewhat thematically so as to make them easier to deal with.
Fortunately, you can move panel launchers quite easily by right-clicking 
the launcher in question, selecting Move from the pop-up menu, and then 
dragging the launcher to the spot you want to place it. Once the launcher is 
where you want it to be, click the launcher once, and it will stay there.
To get some practice with this moving business, let’s move the launchers, 
menus, and drawers you added by placing them in the following order, from 
left to right: Applications, Places, System, Firefox, Help, OpenOffice.org Writer, 
OpenOffice.org Calc, Sound & Video, Games, Drawer. Place the remaining 
launchers toward the right end of the panel, to the left of the Network 
Manager applet or any others that appear their automatically, in the following 
left-to-right order: Eyes, Wanda (Fish), Force Quit. Finally, place the Run 
Application applet by itself, midway between the two clusters of launchers. 
When you’ve made all your changes, your panel should look pretty much 
like mine in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13: The GNOME panel with the new launchers
More Panel Fun
In addition to the basic customization you did in Project 3A, you can do a lot 
more to change the look and feel of your panel. Of course, you can remove 
any of your launchers, drawers, or menus by right-clicking the item in ques-
tion and then selecting Remove From Panel in the pop-up menu, but there 
are still more options. Most of these are available by right-clicking any open 
space in the panel and then selecting Properties, which will open the Panel 
Properties window.
From this window you can change the position of the panel, alter its size, 
change its color, or make it transparent—very cool. You can also set the 
panel so that it will automatically disappear when you are not using it and 
have it reappear when you bring your mouse cursor into the area where the 
panel normally resides. Don’t feel afraid to play around—that’s half the fun!

38
Chapter 3
Now that you have learned about some of the cool and useful things you can 
do with your panel, let’s now move on to the topic of menus. A very nice fea-
ture of GNOME is that it allows you to edit its menus. You can add launchers, 
remove items, move items, and even change the icons that appear within the 
menus. All in all, you have a lot of control over things, but for this project, you’ll 
limit the work to two of these areas: changing icons and moving menu items.
3B-1: Changing Icons Within Menus
As you no doubt recall, one of the problems with the OpenOffice.org Writer 
and Calc launchers you added to the panel was that they shared rather similar 
icons. If you select ApplicationsOffice, you will see that the icons for the 
various OpenOffice.org modules, although not the same, are also a bit similar. 
To remedy this state of affairs, you will change these icons to the same set 
you used for the two panel launchers in Project 3A-4. In this case, just follow 
these steps:
1.
Right-click the Applications menu and select Edit Menus, or go to the 
System menu and select PreferencesMain Menu.
2.
In the menu editor window that then appears (Figure 3-14), click Office 
in the left pane. The contents of that menu will then appear in the 
right pane.
3.
In the right pane of the window, click OpenOffice.org Word Processor 
once, and then click the Properties button. A Launcher Properties window 
will then appear.
4.
In the Name box of that window, first shorten the name of launcher 
down to Writer or Word Processor or whatever naming works for you.
5.
Next, click the Icon button (it doesn't say Icon but rather has the Writer 
icon on it). Using the method described in “Project 3A-4: Changing Panel 
Launcher Icons” on page 33, navigate to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/
apps in the Choose an icon window that then appears.
6.
Scroll down to and click openofficeorg3-writer.png, and then click Open.
7.
The new icon should now appear in the Launcher Properties window. 
Click Close, and you will be able to see the change in the menu editor 
window.
8.
Repeat the process for OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet, and even 
OpenOffice.org Presentation, if you like. Just be sure to choose an 
appropriate name and to select the appropriate icon for each 
(openofficeorg3-calc.png for Spreadsheet and openofficeorg3-impress.png for 
Presentation, for example). Once you’re done, leave the editor window 
open to continue work on Project 3B-2.

39
Figure 3-14: Customizing your menus
3B-2: Changing the Order of Icons Within Menus
While you still have everything open to the Office menu, let’s deal with what 
I consider to be another problem: the order of the items in the menu. It just 
doesn’t make sense to me to have what is arguably the most commonly used 
office application, your word processor, way down there at the bottom of 
the menu.
Remedying this situation is easy. Just click the OpenOffice.org Word 
Processor icon in the right pane of the menu editor window. Then click the 
Move Up button on the right side of the window as many times as necessary 
until the Word Processor icon is right there at the top of the list.
Now that your word processor is up there at the top of the menu, the 
other OpenOffice.org modules seem a bit out of place down at the bottom, 
so you might as well move the other OpenOffice.org modules up near the 
top too by using the same method.
While I’m being logical and all, why not make things even better by getting 
the Evolution launcher out of the Office menu and moving it over to the Inter-
net menu, which seems a far more natural place for it to be? If you agree and 
want to hide this instance of Evolution, just uncheck the box next to its name. 
The name of that entry should then switch to italic typeface, indicating that the 
item in question will not be visible in the actual drop-down menu. Once you’re 
done, your menu editor window should look something like mine in Figure 3-15. 
If all seems fine to you, click Close and then select ApplicationsOffice to 
check out the results.

Chapter 3
Figure 3-15: Managing menus with the menu editor
Now add Evolution to the Internet menu by clicking Internet in the left 
pane of the menu editor window and then clicking the New Item button. In 
the Create Launcher window that appears, type Evolution Mail and Calendar 
in the Name box and evolution in the Command box. The Evolution icon 
should then automatically appear in the icon button. Once done, click OK, 
after which the new Evolution entry will appear in the Internet menu. Close 
the menu editor window. 
Virtual Desktops
It is now time to discuss a rather convenient feature of Linux: virtual desktops. 
Although the virtual desktop feature has only recently made its way into other 
operating systems, it has been a Linux feature for years (yes, it started here, 
folks). But rather than babble on about what this virtual desktop business is 
and what it can do for you, it is probably best to have you learn about it by 
giving you some hands-on experience.
In your GNOME panel, click the Wanda (Fish), OpenOffice.org Writer, 
and Firefox launchers. You will then have three windows open in your 
present desktop, or workspace. Now look at the Workspace Switcher to the 
right of the bottom panel. There should be four boxes, with the one on the 
left (your present workspace) in light gray. If you click the box next to that, 
now in dark gray, all your open windows will suddenly disappear.
Actually, nothing has really disappeared—you are just viewing a new desk-
top. All your other windows are still open and running in the previous desktop.

In this second desktop, you can open something else: Select Applications
GamesAisleRiot Solitaire. The AisleRiot Solitaire card game will soon appear.
You now have windows open in two different desktops, and you can switch 
back and forth between them. To do so, just go to the Workspace Switcher in 
your panel, and click the now gray left box, which will take you to your origi-
nal desktop. Once you’ve done that, the box for the workspace you were 
just in will turn dark gray, and you can then click that one to go back to your 
game desktop.
As you can imagine, this feature has some potential benefits for you, in 
addition to helping you avoid clutter. Just imagine that you are at work typ-
ing some long document in OpenOffice.org Writer. Eventually, you get tired 
and decide to goof off a bit by playing a game, such as Mines, for a while. To 
do this, you switch to another desktop where you open and play the game. A 
bit later, when you notice your boss making the rounds of the office, you sim-
ply switch back to the first desktop so that you look busy when he walks by 
and asks, “Keeping yourself busy, Boaz?”
Phew!
By the way, you can also switch between virtual desktops by simultaneously 
pressing and holding CTRL-ALT and then pressing your left and right arrow 
keys to move to your targeted desktop.
So, what happens if, let’s say, you are running OpenOffice.org Writer in 
one workspace and the GIMP in another but suddenly think that it would be 
handy to have them both running in the same workspace? Do you quit the 
GIMP and start it up again in the other desktop? Fortunately, things are much 
simpler than that, and there are actually two ways to get the job done.
The first of these ways is to right-click the title bar of the window you want 
to move, and then select Move to Workspace Left or Move to Workspace Right. 
You can also select Move to Another Workspace and then select the workspace 
you want to move the window to by number: Workspace 1, Workspace 2, 
Workspace 3, and so on.
If you prefer keeping your hands more on your keyboard than on your 
mouse, you can also move a window from workspace to workspace by using 
hotkeys. With the window you want to move active (on top of the pile, so to 
speak), press and hold SHIFT-CTRL-ALT, and then use the left and right cursor 
keys to move the window to the desired desktop
Wanda Revisited—GNOME Easter Eggs
Well, now that you’ve finished with your work in this chapter, it’s time to 
goof around a bit by revisiting our precocious piscean pal, Wanda. Knowing 
what you now do about Wanda the fish, you might find it odd for me to start 
talking about her again, but Wanda has a few more tricks beneath her fins. 
In fact, she is a good means by which to introduce two of GNOME’s most 
famous Easter eggs. Easter eggs, in case you don’t know, are hidden snippets 
of code that programmers seem to love to sneak into their programs. They are 
usually pretty useless things, but they can be found in all operating systems, 
numerous applications, and even on DVDs (to find out more about those, go 
to http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/). A good example of an Easter egg is my first 

42
Chapter 3
encounter with one on my first Mac, an ancient Mac SE with a whopping 
2MB of RAM. On that machine, you could bring up an image (or was it a 
slide show?) of the Mac SE development team by pressing the seldom used 
debug key on the side of the machine and then typing G 41D89A. Pretty cool, I 
guess, but I would never ever have stumbled upon it had I not read about it 
in some magazine.
As my example shows, accessing these Easter eggs usually requires some 
unusual maneuvers, ones that you would never perform in the normal course 
of things. To see a Wanda-related Easter egg in action, click the Run Application 
button you just added to the panel, type gegls from outer space in the Com-
mand box, and then click Run. You will then see an odd little game of the 
Space Invaders genre, shown in Figure 3-16, in which Wanda defends our 
beloved planet from . . . well, gegls, I guess.
Figure 3-16: One of GNOME’s Wanda-related Easter eggs
To try the other Wanda Easter egg, open the Run Application panel applet 
again, but this time type free the fish, and then click Run. Wanda will now 
appear swimming around your desktop. If you then click her, she will swim 
away and out of the picture . . . but she’ll be back.
To put an end to Wanda’s comings and goings, you will need to restart 
the GNOME panel. There several rather inelegant ways of going about this, 
but for now you can do it by opening the Run Application panel applet again, 
typing killall gnome-panel, and then clicking Run. Your panels will disappear 
for a second or two but will shortly reappear. Wanda, however, will be gone.

Shutting Down
The actual shutdown will take a few seconds as the system closes its various 
services. When it is all done, the system should power down your computer as 
well, in which case you are done. On a few machines, however, the system 
might not be able power down your machine. You will know whether this is 
so in your case because all screen activity will come to an end. If you get to 
that point and nothing else happens for 15 seconds or so, then just power 
down the machine manually by pressing the power button. It is completely 
safe to do so at that point.
Figure 3-18: Pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE in unison brings up the 
Shut Down the Computer window
Now that you know your desktop environment 
so well, you may feel like calling it a day and 
shutting down your machine. To do so, just 
click the Quit button at the far-right corner of 
the top panel (it looks like a power button). 
A menu (Figure 3-17) will appear with eight 
choices to choose from: Lock Screen, Guest 
Session, Switch from rg (whatever your user-
name happens to be), Log Out, Suspend, 
Hibernate, Restart, and Shut Down. (Hiber-
nate is not an option when running a live ses-
sion from the Ubuntu Desktop CD). Select 
Shut Down, and a small window will appear to 
confirm your decision. Click Shut Down, and 
the shutdown process will begin. If, however, 
nothing seems to happen within a few seconds, 
press CTRL-ALT-DELETE in unison, which will 
open a Shut Down the Computer window 
(Figure 3-18). In that window, click Shut 
Down, after which shutdown will commence.

Connecting to the Internet
These days, the average home computer 
user spends more time surfing the Web and 
writing email messages than doing just about 
anything else. Even if you’re not much of a 
surfer, there are still numerous other applications that 
aren’t really Internet applications per se but that still 
use the Internet in some way, such as gathering song
and album information when you rip audio CDs to create MP3 files. Having a 
computer that isn’t hooked up to the Internet is like buying a new Maserati 
and then refusing to take it out of the garage. 
Of course, how you connect to the Internet depends on your hardware 
and provider. There are a number of possibilities in this area, including 
high-speed local area networks (LANs), cable modems, mobile (3G) broad-
band, and ADSL connections from phone companies. Some computers still 
have an internal 56Kbps modem or can be connected to external dial-up 
modems for slower connections over regular phone lines. Depending on 
what you have, setting things up on your system should prove a cinch in the 
case of LAN connections and any others that use your Ethernet port (such as 

46
Chapter 4
cable modems), possibly a bit more work in the case of wireless and mobile 
connections, and sometimes a bit of a challenge when it comes to dial-up 
connections. In this chapter you will learn how to set up these connections, 
and in the next chapter you will  learn a bit about what Linux has to offer in 
terms of the most commonly used Internet applications.
How Do You Connect?
The way you go about setting up your connection really depends on how you’re 
trying to connect to the Internet. Here’s a list to help you decide which method 
to use:
z
If you connect your computer to a wall socket, a router, or a cable modem 
by using an Ethernet cable, go to “Setting Up a Wired Connection” on 
page 46.
z
If you connect to a wireless network or your own wireless router, head to 
“Setting Up a Wireless Connection” on page 49.
z
If you connect using a dial-up modem connected to your phone line, the 
section “Setting Up a Dial-up Connection” on page 53 is the one for you.
z
If you have an ADSL or DSL modem that is built in to your computer or 
connects to a USB port, try “Connecting with a DSL or ADSL Modem” 
on page 52.
z
If you connect using a mobile (3G) broadband connection that plugs 
in to your computer, skip to “Mobile (3G) Broadband Connections” on 
page 55.
Setting Up a Wired Connection
If you have a high-speed Internet connection from your cable television com-
pany or ISP or if you are connected to the Internet by a LAN at your office, 
you are really in luck, because these setups are probably the easiest to deal 
with. I’m going to assume that you’ve already set up your router or modem 
according to your Internet provider’s instructions, so all that remains is to 
connect an Ethernet cable between the modem/router (or LAN wall socket) 
and your computer’s network socket. After you’ve done that, you should be 
ready to go without any further settings to fool with.
Checking Your Connection
If you like, you can see whether you’re connected by opening Firefox (click 
the Firefox launcher in the top panel, right next to the System menu) and 
then, once it starts up, trying to navigate to a common site, such as http://
www.yahoo.com/. If the site comes up, you know you’re all set.
If you have a problem getting online and you are trying to connect via a 
LAN or cable modem, you could try to refresh your connection by right-click-
ing the Network Manager icon in the top panel, unchecking the Enable 

More Than Webbed Feet
47
Networking box in the pop-up menu, waiting a few seconds, and then checking 
the Enable Networking box in the pop-up menu again. If that doesn’t work, 
try restarting your machine while physically connected to your Internet 
source with the Ethernet cable. If the lack of connectivity persists, it is possible 
that your network card is not supported by Linux. This is relatively rare but, 
fortunately, easily remedied (by replacing it). 
The problem could also be that your network or service provider does 
not automatically assign addresses via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP). DHCP is a means by which your Internet provider can automatically 
provide your system with the configuration information it needs in order to 
connect to the Internet. If your provider does not use DHCP, you will have to 
get the necessary information about settings from the network administrator 
or service provider and enter the settings yourself.
Setting Up a Cable or Ethernet Connection for Providers Not Using DHCP
To input your cable or Ethernet settings yourself, first get the settings you 
need from your network administrator or Internet provider, and then per-
form the following steps:
1.
Select SystemPreferencesNetwork Connections.
2.
Choose the Wired tab (Figure 4-1), and select the network connection 
from the list by clicking it once (it should have a name like Auto eth0). If 
there are no entries in the list, then your network card hasn’t been prop-
erly recognized. Take a look at “Installing Drivers for Your Network/
Wireless Card” on page 390 to see how to fix this.
Figure 4-1: The Network Connections window
3.
Click Edit, and you’ll be presented with a settings window. Choose the 
IPv4 Settings tab, and change the Method setting from Automatic (DHCP) 
to Manual.

48
Chapter 4
4.
Click the Add button to enter the IP address information for your com-
puter. This should have been provided by your ISP or network adminis-
trator and will consist of an IP address, default gateway, and netmask 
(see Figure 4-2 for an example). Enter the DNS server address that you 
were given too.
Figure 4-2: Manually inputting network IP settings
5.
Make sure that the Available to all users option is checked if other users 
of your computer will be using the connection.
6.
Click Apply to save the settings. You’ll be asked to enter the password for 
your user account, so do that, and click Authenticate.
7.
Network Manager will try to establish the connection using the details 
you just provided. If it’s successful, a message will pop up saying that the 
network was connected. If that doesn’t happen, click the Network Man-
ager icon on the top panel, and choose Disconnect.
8.
Then, click the Network Manager icon again, and select your network 
underneath where it says Available.
NOTE
If you are wondering what Internet Protocol (IP) and Domain Name Service (DNS) 
are all about, you can simply think of them in this way: DNS translates the easy-to-
remember URLs that you have come to know, such as http://www.google.com/, 
into numerical, or IP, addresses that the Internet can understand. The address http://
www.google.com/ thus becomes http://209.85.229.104. You can type the numeri-
cal version into your browser later to see for yourself.

Setting Up a Wireless Connection
With the right wireless hardware, you can now surf the Web just about any-
where you can catch a (radio) wave, so to speak. Whether you happen to be 
at your breakfast table, in the library of your university, or at your local Star-
bucks, you can now go online without having to physically hook up your com-
puter to anything. 
Fortunately, the process of setting up wireless networking in Ubuntu is 
quite easy and not very different from what you just read in the previous section.
Hardware
If you lead a solely wired existence or are just inexperienced in this particular 
area, there are a few things worth knowing. To get started, you need to have 
the right hardware. If you just want to go wireless, then all you need is a wire-
less network card (sometimes referred to as an 802.11a/b/g/n card or WiFi 
card). These are built in to almost all modern laptops, while for older models 
they are usually add-ons in the form of cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot 
on the side of your computer (as shown on the right of Figure 4-3). 
Figure 4-3: All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card
Some wireless cards plug into one of your machine’s USB ports or, in the 
case of desktop models, one of its PCI slots. Although support for cards of 
this type has improved through the past couple of years, there are still gaps, 
and some can be rather tricky to deal with. You’ll find some tips on how to 
deal with awkward cards in Chapter 21, but if you’re looking for a sure thing, 
Centrino IPW-2100 and IPW-2200 cards are definitely supported by Ubuntu. 
As for cards of the built-in or PC card variety, you will find support much better, 
but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the card you are 
using is Linux compatible. No matter what wireless card you are wondering 
about, the easiest way to find out whether it will work is to just try it. The 
Linux kernel now comes with many wireless drivers built in, and Ubuntu 

50
Chapter 4
updates often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is compatible with 
one of those drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things don’t seem to 
work, check Ubuntu’s list of supported cards (https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/), or check the Ubuntu forums to 
find a driver that is compatible or to see whether anyone has experience with 
your particular card.
If you want to set up a wireless system in your home or office, then you will 
also need to get a wireless access point (WAP), shown on the left of Figure 4-3. 
Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not really much of an issue in this depart-
ment, because the access point doesn’t physically interface with your computer, 
and the settings are handled via your web browser.
NOTE
Access points come in several different types. The most common type is a wireless router, 
which many ISPs provide for free.
You should be aware, however, that a few access points require you to 
use Internet Explorer to handle their setup chores. Although it is possible 
to get Internet Explorer up and running in Linux via Wine (as you’ll see in 
Chapter 18), you can’t be 100 percent sure that it will work. Unless you have 
a Windows machine somewhere in your house or office to handle such chores, 
it is probably a good idea to steer clear of access points of this kind.
Activating Your Wireless Card
Setting up a Linux-compatible wireless PC card is actually relatively simple. 
First connect your access point to your Internet source, and then turn on 
the access point. Once it is up and running, plug your wireless card into the 
PCMCIA slot or USB port on your laptop (unless your wireless connection 
is built in, in which case you can forgo this step). Any LEDs on the external 
card will most likely light up at this time.
If your access point was on when you booted up your computer and your 
wireless card was in place during bootup, you probably don’t need to do much 
else to access the Internet. Just follow these steps:
1.
Click the Network Manager icon on the top panel to reveal a drop-down 
menu showing the wireless signals that are present in your vicinity and 
the strength of each signal (Figure 4-4). 
2.
From that menu, select the signal for your access point (or any other 
wave you are entitled to latch onto) by clicking it. 
3.
Your system will then try to connect to the Internet. Once a connection 
is made, the Network Manager icon will morph into a small signal-
strength indicator. Pretty handy.
4.
If your network has a WEP or WPA password, you’ll be prompted to enter 
it. It can be useful to check Show password before you type the password 
so you can check for any mistakes. Click Connect when you’re finished.

More Than Webbed Feet
51
NOTE
Most access points employ an added level of security in the form of Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP) or a Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) key. If you didn’t choose your own 
password when you set up the access point, try looking for a sticker on the base or side of 
the access point to see whether a default one is used. If you’re trying to connect to a net-
work for which you don’t happen to know the key, then chances are you are not supposed 
to be making the connection in the first place. Naughty, naughty.
Figure 4-4: The Network Manager shows you avail-
able wireless networks and their signal strengths.
If you were not successful in making your wireless connection (the system 
will tell you whether that’s the case), you have a few possibilities beyond the 
annoying noncompatible-card scenario. First, double-check to make sure 
your card is actually physically turned on. I know that sounds dumb, but I have 
been guilty of this oversight myself on numerous occasions. Many laptops have 
a key you can press to enable or disable the wireless card; on mine you have to 
press the function key (FN) and F2 at the same time.
Another, less common, possibility is that your network does not use 
DHCP, in which case you will have to manually input your connection set-
tings as provided by your network administrator or service provider. Armed 
with that information, simply follow the steps listed in “Setting Up a Cable or 
Ethernet Connection for Providers Not Using DHCP” on page 47. Just be 
sure to use the Wireless tab instead of the Wired one.
If you still have no luck connecting wirelessly, the drivers may not be 
installed for your card, or Ubuntu may not support the card. You can try 
plenty of tricks to get things working, so head over to Chapter 21 and look 
for “Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card” on page 390.
Switching Off or Refreshing Your Wireless Connection
Sometimes you’ll want to disconnect from a wireless network, such as when 
you use your laptop on an airplane or when you just want to connect to a 

52
Chapter 4
different network, as you might when moving your laptop from one wireless 
hotspot to another.
To do this, click the Network Manager icon once to reveal the list of 
available wireless networks (that is, signals). In that list, click the Disconnect 
option below the name of the wireless network to which you are connected. 
Within a second or two, you will be disconnected.
If you want to turn off your wireless card (as you should do if you’re 
boarding an airplane) and you don’t have a physical way to do it, like a switch 
or a button, just right-click the Network Manager icon, and then deselect 
Enable Wireless. And if you want to turn that card back on again, just get 
back to that menu, and select Enable Wireless again.
Sometimes, your wireless card might lose its connection for no apparent 
reason, so it can be useful to refresh the connection (that is, turn it off and 
on again) to try to get it back. The quickest way to do this is to click the Net-
work Manager icon and then click the name of your wireless network in the 
list. You’ll be disconnected and then automatically reconnected.
If that doesn’t work, try disabling and then enabling the wireless connec-
tion using Network Manager’s Enable Wireless option, as described earlier. If 
you still have no luck, try turning the wireless card off and on again using a 
switch or button if you have one, or unplug it and plug it back in again. Finally, if 
nothing seems to be working, try restarting the computer.
Connecting with a DSL or ADSL Modem
How easy it is to set up your DSL or ADSL modem depends on the connector 
that it has. If it can be connected using an Ethernet cable, use that, and fol-
low the instructions in “Setting Up a Wired Connection” on page 46; it’ll be 
much easier than trying to use a USB cable! If you have a USB or internal 
modem, try the instructions in this section and hope for the best.
The first step is to check whether Ubuntu recognized your modem. 
Assuming it’s already plugged in, click SystemPreferencesNetwork 
Connections, and select the DSL tab. If a connection is listed in that window, 
your modem was recognized, and you can begin setting it up. If the list is 
empty, refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/internet/C/modems-adsl-usb.html to 
see whether there are any steps you can follow to get your modem working.
Select the connection by clicking it once, and then click Edit. Click the 
DSL tab of the Editing window that appears, and enter your username and 
password into the appropriate fields. Then enter your connection informa-
tion (usually a phone number) into the Service box, and click Apply. Now, 
click the Network Manager icon on the top panel, and choose your DSL con-
nection from the list. Network Manager will try to connect using your modem—
if it’s not successful, go back and try changing some of the settings to see 
whether you can get it to cooperate.

Setting Up a Dial-up Connection
Although much of the world is moving to high-speed Internet connections, 
many of you may still be using dial-up Internet connections, which means 
you need to have a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your box to 
the outside world. In case you broadband surf-gods have forgotten, modems 
are those wonderful machines that whistle, chime, screech, and spit when-
ever you dial up your Internet provider. I suppose you could think of them as 
noisy telephones in need of a good burp.
Now here comes the bad news—in the world of Linux, very few internal 
modems are supported, and for those that are, the setup process can be quite 
frustrating. The main reason behind this compatibility problem is that most 
built-in modems are software dependent, and the software they depend on is 
part of, or designed for, Windows. Such modems are thus called Winmodems.
Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with 
these Winmodem beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. Though 
support for the wide variety of Winmodem models out there is still rather 
spotty, things are better than before, so you might just luck out. My advice is to 
hold off on the wondering and worrying and just give your modem a try to see 
whether it works. If it does, then you’re all set. If it doesn’t, well, then you do 
have some options, and at least you haven’t done any damage to your system.
With all that intro-babble out of the way, let’s get down to the steps for 
setting up your dial-up connection. First, get the settings information you 
need from your Internet provider. Most providers aim their operations at 
Windows and often Mac users, and very few offer Linux support. Still, there is 
no technical reason for your Linux system not to work via their setup, so just 
nag and push them until they give you the information you want. After that, 
make sure your modem is connected to a live telephone connection—for 
example, the phone jack in your wall.
Now it’s time to set up the connection. I’ll use the GNOME PPP pro-
gram to do all of the setting up here, but there’s a caveat: It’s not installed by 
default, and you need an Internet connection to install it! If you have access 
to some other Internet connection that you can use temporarily, connect to 
that, and use the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install GNOME 
PPP (see Chapter 6 to learn how to install software). The alternative is to use 
the pppconfig command, which is installed by default but is difficult to use. 
Find another computer and check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/
DialupModemHowto/SetUpDialer/ for instructions if you have no alternative 
but to use pppconfig.
Assuming that you got GNOME PPP installed using a borrowed Internet 
connection, you can follow these steps to set up your modem:
1.
Select ApplicationsInternetGNOME PPP, after which GNOME PPP 
will appear.
2.
Click Setup, and make sure you’re looking at the Modem tab.

54
Chapter 4
3.
Click the Detect button to identify your modem. If you get a message 
saying that no modem was found on your system, then you’re out of 
luck—the best you can do is ask for advice on the Ubuntu forums 
(http://www.ubuntuforums.org/) or try selecting items from the Devices 
drop-down list by trial and error.
4.
How you change the rest of the settings depends on how your modem 
and ISP are set up, so select the defaults for now. If these don’t work, 
trial and error is a potential way forward again.
5.
Click Close to get back to the GNOME PPP window. Type your user-
name and password, and enter the phone number provided by your ISP.
6.
Click Connect. You should then hear your modem begin its dialing, 
spitting, and churning sequence as it makes the connection with your 
provider.
7.
If you manage to get connected, you can start your browsing, emailing, 
or whatever else it is you do online. If you get an error message, there’s 
little you can do but take a deep breath and click the Setup button to try 
tweaking your settings.
What to Do If Your Modem Isn’t Compatible
Though it may not sound that way, what I’ve just described is pretty much a 
best-case scenario. What happens, however, if your modem and Ubuntu do 
not see eye to eye? Well, there are a few options. My first, more radical sug-
gestion, is to dump your dial-up ISP and find a broadband provider that cov-
ers your local area. If that is not an option, then you have two ways to go. One 
is to try to geek around with your modem to see whether you can get it to 
work. This is a slightly more complicated process, but there are instructions 
at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto. If you are faint of 
heart or a novice user, you may find what the process entails to be a bit more 
than you’re willing to deal with. 
The simpler, although costlier, way to get your modem to work is to pur-
chase a true hardware modem. Hardware modems are not software dependent, 
so they work with any operating system. You can think of them as telephones 
without a handset.
Such modems come in two forms: internal and external. As for the inter-
nals, the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal 
slot) and 56 PC Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true hardware 
modems that are easily available and are said to work. You can check out the 
USRobotics site (http://www.usr.com/) for more information on these models, 
though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions is always a good idea. 
Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an external dial-up modem. They 
come with either serial or USB connectors and sit in a box outside your com-
puter. Because the modem doesn’t use your operating system to operate, it 
does not tie up system resources while it’s busy, which may result in a possible 
pickup in computer speed.

More Than Webbed Feet
55
Linux support for USB modems can be patchy, so do your research before 
buying one. External serial modems are a safer bet since most of them should 
work with your system . . . if you have a serial port, that is. Modern computers 
rarely have them any more, so check to see whether you have one by looking 
at the back of your computer for a connector with little prongs in it (see 
Figure 4-5). If you are worried and are looking for a sure thing, Zoom Tele-
phonics (http://www.zoom.com/) makes an external serial modem that is com-
patible with Linux, and the company says so right on its website. The USRobotics 
56K V.92 External Faxmodem is also said to work, though I haven’t tried this 
model myself.
Figure 4-5: Serial port and connector
If you find another model that you think will do the trick, before you 
commit to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search with 
that modem’s make and model number, along with the word linux, and see 
what search results you get. Of course, you can also try one of the Linux forums 
and ask about the modem make and model there. A lot of people are in the 
same boat, so you are sure to get plenty of opinions and advice. 
Mobile (3G) Broadband Connections
Wireless networks, for all the convenience and freedom that they offer, still 
have quite a limited range. This won’t be an issue if your computer never 
strays from within the general vicinity of your house or office, but it can get 
mighty inconvenient if you’re on the road, miles from the nearest wireless-
enabled coffee shop. This being the 21st century, there are, of course, ways 
around this limitation.
If you’re a computer-equipped traveler, you’ve probably already come 
across mobile broadband technology, also known as 3G. All you need to get 
a high-speed connection on the go is a 3G card (also inexplicably called a 

56
Chapter 4
dongle), which plugs into your computer and connects you to the Net via a 
cell phone network (Figure 4-6). Ubuntu has pretty good support for most 
3G cards right from the get-go, and the setup process is a snap:
1.
Plug your 3G card or dongle into the computer; the New Mobile Broad-
band Connection Wizard should open automatically. If it doesn’t, click 
SystemPreferencesNetwork Connections, open the Mobile Broadband 
tab, and click Add.
2.
The first page of the wizard has a drop-down list that should have the 
make and model of your 3G card displayed in it. If it says Any Device 
instead, your card may not have been recognized, so take a look at https://
wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager/Hardware/3G/ to see whether there are 
any steps you need to take to get Ubuntu to recognize the card.
3.
Click Forward, select your country from the list, and then click Forward 
again.
4.
Pick your mobile broadband provider from the list, and then hit Forward.
5.
Now you need to select your broadband billing plan from the drop-down 
list (Figure 4-7). It’s important that you choose the right plan to avoid 
being wrongly charged. If you don’t see a plan that looks appropriate, 
choose My plan is not listed, and call up your broadband provider to ask 
what to put in the Access Point Name (APN) box.
6.
Click Forward, check that all of the details look OK, and click Apply. 
You’ll be taken to an Editing window where you can enter details such as 
your account PIN and password if needed.
7.
Click Apply, and then close the Network Connections window to finish up.

Figure 4-7: Choosing a broadband billing plan
To connect to mobile broadband, click the Network Manager icon on 
the top panel, and choose your broadband service from the list. Network 
Manager will spend a few seconds establishing the connection, after which 
you’ll be notified that you’re connected (or not, as the case may be). Discon-
necting happens in just about the same way: Click the Network Manager icon 
again, but this time select the Disconnect item just below the name of your 
broadband service when the list pops up.
I’m Connected . . . So Now What?
Ideally you’re cabled in, wired up, or otherwise happily connected to the Inter-
net. (If not, take a look at Chapter 21 for some connection-troubleshooting 
tips.) That’s great news, because now you can put Ubuntu through its paces 
by trying some of the interesting web-related software that comes preinstalled. 
Prime your clicking finger for action, and flip the page to see what life online 
is like as a new Linux user.

Exploring the Internet, Linux Style
Now that you have a working Internet con-
nection, what can you do with it? The good 
news is that Linux can match anything that 
your previous operating system could do online, 
and in many cases it can do it faster or more easily. 
Ubuntu was born on the Web, so it should be no surprise 
that it comes with a very healthy suite of Internet-ready 
applications right out of the box.
In this chapter, you’ll take a tour of Ubuntu’s Internet software so you 
can start really getting a feel for what this Linux stuff is capable of. You’ll 
begin with old stalwarts like the web browser and email client, tour briefly 
through instant messaging, and then head off in the more modish direction 
of Twitter and microblogging.

Chapter 5
Firefox: Your Internet Browser
The default web browser in your Ubuntu system is Firefox, which is enjoying 
increasing popularity in not only the Linux world but in the Windows and 
Mac worlds as well. Chances are you are already a Firefox user, but if you are 
not, then you needn’t worry—things work more or less the same in all browsers. 
That being the case, you should be able to use Firefox’s basic features without 
any instruction. Of course, some of its features do distinguish Firefox from its 
competition, so I will mention those.
Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs
Usually when you click a link on a web page, the new page opens in the same 
window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a 
new, separate window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a 
new window by right-clicking the link and then selecting the Open Link in 
New Window option. This can be very useful; however, once you have more 
than a few browser windows open, it gets sort of hard to find what you’re 
looking for in all those open windows. It can also slow things down a bit.
This is where Firefox’s tab feature comes in handy (so handy, in fact, that 
almost every other browser out there has copied it). To see how it works, try 
it yourself right here and now. Open your Firefox browser by clicking the 
launcher on the top GNOME panel (or selecting ApplicationsInternet
Firefox Web Browser); then search for the word nyckelharpa using Firefox’s 
handy search box, which is at the top-right corner of the browser window (see 
Figure 5-1). By default, Firefox will perform searches for keywords entered in 
the search box using Google. You can, if you like, select other websites to 
search by clicking the colored g icon in the search box and then making your 
selection. Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! are available, to name a few, and 
you can even add others. For now, however, let’s stick to Google for our 
present search, by typing nyckelharpa in that search box. Once you’ve finished 
typing, press the ENTER key, after which a page of search results should 
appear in the main pane of the Firefox window.
One of the top results should be the American Nyckelharpa Association, 
and you are now going to open that page in a new tab, rather than in the same 
or a new window. To do that, right-click the link, and in the pop-up menu that 
appears, select Open Link in New Tab. You can, if you prefer, make things 
a tad easier and dispense with the pop-up menu selection step by simply click-
ing the link with the middle mouse button (or with both mouse buttons 
simultaneously) or by holding down the CTRL key as you click the link. 
Either way, the new page will appear in a new tab, while your original page of 
search results remains, ready and waiting in the other tab (see Figure 5-2). I 
am pretty confident in saying that, once you get used to this feature, you will 
wonder how you ever got along without it.

Chapter 5
Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks
The Web is awash with all sorts of news and information, and it can be hard 
to keep tabs on it all. Personally, I hate missing my daily dose of offbeat stories 
from Boing Boing, the aptly subtitled “directory of wonderful things” (http://
www.boingboing.net/). Fortunately, Firefox has a neat way of dealing with your 
information overload, called live bookmarks (also known as RSS feeds). These 
provide you with an automatically updated list of articles from any website that 
supports them. To see an example, click the Latest Headlines link underneath 
Firefox’s address bar—it’s a live bookmark for the BBC News website and 
should show you a long list of current news stories.
You can check whether a website has an RSS feed by looking in the address 
bar for an orange beacon symbol (like the one shown in Figure 5-3). If it has 
one, you’re in business! Let’s use Boing Boing as an example: Load http://
www.boingboing.net/ in Firefox, and click the beacon icon. You’ll get a list of 
the most recent articles along with an invitation to subscribe to the feed in 
the box at the top of the page. Click Subscribe Now, and in the window that 
appears, click Subscribe to add the live bookmark to the same toolbar as the 
Latest Headlines link.
Figure 5-3: The beacon icon is displayed when a 
website has an associated RSS feed.
Some websites provide links to their RSS feeds rather than showing them 
in the address bar. If you find one of these links (it’s normally called ATOM 
or RSS/XML), click it, and you should be taken to a list of articles with a box 
at the top, like in the previous example. From there, the steps for adding the 
feed to your bookmarks are the same.
Pop-up Manager
Firefox has a number of other useful features. One is its Popup Manager, 
which suppresses those annoying pop-up windows that often appear when 
you access a new web page. You can enable or disable this feature from the 
Preferences window (EditPreferences) by clicking the Content icon in the 
top pane of that window and then checking or unchecking the Block pop-up 
windows box. You can also permit certain sites to provide pop-up windows 
(some pop-ups are not only useful but necessary for the correct functioning 
of a site) by clicking the Exceptions button to the right of that Block pop-up 
windows entry and inputting the web address for the site in question.
Multimedia Plug-Ins
One of the coolest things about Firefox is that it allows you to further expand 
its functionality by adding various extensions. The most commonly used exten-
sions come in the form of plug-ins. These allow web pages to do much more 
than just display text and pictures—you’ll often need a plug-in to watch videos 
or play games online. Three plug-ins are used far more widely than any others, 
so I’ll concentrate on those here.

Slipping and Sliding
63
Flash
The most frequently used browser plug-in for any system is Adobe’s Flash 
Player. Flash provides websites with all sorts of exciting multimedia effects 
and capabilities, and as a result, it is used by an ever-increasing number of 
sites. In fact, chances are you’ve probably seen numerous Flash-enhanced 
pages without even being aware of it. For example, if you’ve ever watched a 
video on YouTube, you’ve enjoyed the wonders of Flash.
How do you get the Flash Player plug-in? Well, all it takes is a few clicks 
and a working Internet connection:
1.
Select ApplicationsUbuntu Software Center to open the Software Center.
2.
Type adobe flash in the search box at the top right of the window.
3.
In the list that appears, click the Adobe Flash plug-in item once. An Install 
button will appear (Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-4: Installing the Flash plug-in with the Ubuntu Software Center
4.
Click Install; then, if prompted, type your password, and click Authenticate. 
The plug-in will be downloaded and installed.
5.
When the plug-in has finished installing, a green check will appear next 
to the Adobe Flash plug-in’s icon in the list. Close the Ubuntu Software 
Center, and open Firefox (if it was already open, close it, and then start it 
up again).
6.
To check that the plug-in is working, find a site that uses Flash. If you don’t 
know of one offhand, try YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/). Once you 
have arrived at YouTube, click any video link you see. If Flash was installed 
successfully, a video should appear and start playing (Figure 5-5).

64
Chapter 5
Figure 5-5: Playing a YouTube video after installing the Flash plug-in
Silverlight
A relative newcomer to the plug-in scene is Microsoft’s Silverlight. It’s less 
common than Flash but seems to be used on the websites of TV channels and 
major sporting events quite a lot. Unfortunately, Microsoft is a little behind 
the times, and it hasn’t made Silverlight available for Linux yet. But never 
fear: An alternative, open source plug-in called Moonlight is available. To 
install Moonlight, follow these steps:
1.
Open Firefox, and browse to http://www.go-mono.com/moonlight/.
2.
Click the Install button on the Moonlight page, and scroll down to section 3, 
Download the plug-in.
3.
Now, click the green down-pointing arrow. A narrow bar will appear at 
the top of the screen saying that the website was prevented from install-
ing software.
4.
Click the Allow button in the (usually black) bar, and a Software Installa-
tion window will pop up. Click Install Now, and wait for the plug-in to 
download.

Slipping and Sliding
65
5.
Once that’s finished, another bar will appear at the top of the Add-ons 
window. Click Restart Firefox to finish installing the plug-in (all of the 
pages that you have open will reappear when Firefox opens again).
6.
Head over to http://www.farseergames.com/waterdemo/. If Moonlight was 
installed properly, you should now see a little boat bobbing around on 
the waves (Figure 5-6).
Figure 5-6: Checking that the Moonlight plug-in is working properly
Some Silverlight/Moonlight-enabled websites might require you to install 
extra plug-ins, especially if they are trying to display videos. If this is the case, 
yet another bar will appear at the top of the page, telling you that plug-ins are 
missing. Click the Install Missing Plugins button, and follow the onscreen 
instructions to install everything that you need.
Java
One last plug-in that you’re likely to encounter is Java, which is used to run 
Java applets. A Java applet is a little application that you can run in your web 
browser, and they’re commonly used for games and demonstrations. Ubuntu 
comes preinstalled with a Java plug-in called IcedTea, so there’s no need to 
install anything extra. It’s still a good idea to take a look at it in action, though, 
so head over to http://www.turbotanks.com/. An arcade “tanks” game should 
load if IcedTea is working properly (Figure 5-7).

66
Chapter 5
Figure 5-7: Running the TurboTanks game in Firefox
The plug-ins I covered earlier are near-essentials that pretty much everyone 
has installed, but hundreds of other, less vital extensions are available for 
Firefox too. These come in the form of add-ons and include all sort of things; 
many are quite functional, while others are just plain fun and goofy. They 
range from blog-writing tools and to-do lists to image viewers and travel guides. 
For this project, however, you will install a blog editor called ScribeFire (Fig-
ure 5-8) that allows you to write entries, log in to your blog, and upload your 
addition. All of this is available at the click of a button from an icon in the 
bottom-right corner of the window.
NOTE
If you don’t have a blog but you’d like to give blogging a try, you can sign up for an 
account on a free hosting website, such as http://www.blogger.com/, http://
wordpress.com/, http://www.tumblr.com/, or http://www.livejournal.com/.

5-1: Downloading and Installing the ScribeFire Extension
To get started with the process of installing any Firefox extension, you have 
to first find and download one. To do this, go to the Firefox Tools menu, and 
select Add-ons. The Add-ons window will then appear, showing you the exten-
sions, themes, and plug-ins you already have installed. To add the ScribeFire 
extension, click the Get Add-ons button in the pane at the top of the window, 
after which Firefox will make some download recommendations that you can 
accept or ignore.
ScribeFire wasn’t one of Firefox’s recommendations at the time of writing, 
and chances are that it won’t be when you open the Add-ons window either. 
This being the case, just do a search for scribefire in the search box (Figure 5-9). 
Once you find it, click the Add to Firefox button.
A Software Installation window like the one shown in Figure 5-10 will then 
appear. Just click the Install Now button in that window after it becomes 
active to start the installation.

When Firefox first starts up after you’ve installed the ScribeFire extension, 
you will see a small icon in the lower-right corner of the window. Just click 
that icon, and ScribeFire will appear as a resizable pane in the lower half of 
your current Firefox window. A ScribeFire Account Wizard will also pop up, 
asking for details about your blog. Follow the instructions to get it working 
with your blog.
Email with Evolution
Evolution is the default email program in Ubuntu, and it is probably best 
described as a better-groomed, spunkier clone of Microsoft Outlook (see 
Figure 5-12). It allows you to send and receive mail, make appointments, and 
keep a list of tasks. It can also filter junk mail, which is a necessity these days, 
and even synchronize with your PalmPilot, if you still have one of those. Also, 
if such things are important to you, it can connect to a Microsoft Exchange 
server.
Figure 5-12: Ubuntu’s default email client—Evolution
To start using Evolution, just click the envelope icon (called the indicator 
applet) on the top panel, and select Set Up Mail; or select Applications
InternetEvolution Mail.
NOTE
The Set Up Mail option will change to just plain Mail once you’ve entered your 
account details.
When you first run Evolution, you will be greeted by a setup wizard, so 
have the account details you received from your email provider handy. These 
should consist of your POP host address for receiving mail, your SMTP host 
address for sending mail, and your mail password, which is very often different 

70
Chapter 5
from your Internet logon password. Your mail password is not actually 
entered during the various wizard steps, so check the Remember password 
checkbox when filling in the POP details. When you first connect to your 
mail server, you will be prompted for your mail password, so you can type it 
at that time, and you won’t have to deal with it again.
An Email Alternative: Thunderbird
Evolution is the most fully featured email software in the Linux world, but 
despite its obvious attractions and popularity, I prefer the more straightforward 
Thunderbird for my email chores. In contrast to the multifunctional Evolu-
tion, Thunderbird (Figure 5-13) is a more mail-oriented program that is very 
straightforward to use yet includes most of the most important email functions 
you’ve come to expect, such as junk mail filters. In fact, it is remarkably simi-
lar to Windows Mail in terms of appearance and handling. The fact that 
Thunderbird is also available in both Mac and Windows versions means that 
you may already be familiar with it.
Figure 5-13: The Thunderbird email client
Thunderbird does not come bundled with Ubuntu, so if you want to try 
it, you will have to download it and install it yourself. Now that you have set 
up your machine to connect to the Internet, however, you can easily do this 
after going over the contents of Chapter 6 (OK, so I’m jumping the gun a bit 
again). Just do a search in the Ubuntu Software Center for thunderbird, click 
the Mozilla Thunderbird Mail/News item once, and click Install to install it. 
You may be asked to type the password for your Ubuntu user account, so do 
that and click Authenticate. Once it is installed, you can then run Thunder-
bird by selecting ApplicationsInternetMozilla Thunderbird Mail/News.

Slipping and Sliding
71
As I mentioned, both Evolution and Thunderbird are equally capable 
and possess essentially the same features in terms of mail handling. The dif-
ference is primarily a look-and-feel matter. Why not try both Evolution and 
Thunderbird and see which you like better?
By the way, if you find that you prefer Thunderbird to Evolution, you can 
add a panel launcher for it to make things easier on yourself when you want 
to run the program. Just go to ApplicationsInternetMozilla Thunderbird 
Mail/News, right-click that entry, and then in the pop-up menu that appears, 
select Add this launcher to panel.
Chatting with Your Friends via Empathy
Email is an extremely useful tool, but there’s often quite a delay between 
sending a message and getting a response. What if you just fancy a quick 
chat? That’s where instant messaging (IM) comes in. If you’re not familiar with 
the concept, all you do is find your friend on an IM network and type a short 
message to them. Your message will show up on their screen in the blink of an 
eye. They can then reply to it, and you receive their reply just as quickly. So it 
continues, until you say goodbye and disconnect from the network.
There are lots of different IM networks out there, such as AIM, MSN/
Windows Live, and Yahoo! Messenger. You can usually talk only to those 
people who are using the same network as you, and you’ll need an IM client 
application to connect to any of them. Ubuntu comes preinstalled with a 
fully featured IM client called Empathy, which has the ability to connect to 
multiple networks at once.
Starting a Chat
For this section, I’m going to assume that you already have a user account on 
an instant messaging network. If you don’t, you’ll need to go to the network’s 
website and sign up (most of them are free). Now that you have your account 
details ready, let’s get Empathy connected to your chosen network:
1.
Select SystemPreferencesMessaging and VoIP Accounts. The Empathy 
Accounts window will open.
2.
Choose Yes, I’ll enter my account details now, and click Forward.
3.
Select your IM network from the drop-down list at the top of the window, 
and then enter your account details (Figure 5-14). You’ll normally need 
to enter your username and password.
4.
Choose the No, that’s all for now option at the bottom of the window, 
and then click Forward.
5.
You’ll be asked to enter your personal details. These are used to enable 
a feature that lets you talk to other people connected to the same local 
network as you—just enter them for now, choose a nickname, and click 
Apply. The Accounts window will disappear.

72
Chapter 5
Figure 5-14: Entering your instant messaging account details
Your account should now be set up and ready to go, so let’s take it for a 
test run. Click the envelope icon/indicator applet on the top panel, and 
choose Chat from the list (see Figure 5-15). An empty-looking Contact list 
will appear. To get online, choose Available from the drop-down list. If any 
of your IM contacts/friends/buddies are online, they’ll be displayed in the 
main window. If nothing appears, try selecting ViewOffline Contacts in 
case all of your contacts are offline at the moment.
Figure 5-15: Accessing your chat account 
via the indicator applet
If someone is online and available to chat, they’ll have a green speech 
bubble icon next to their name. Double-click their name to start up a conver-
sation. A new window will appear—type a message into the box at the bottom 
of the window, and then hit ENTER to send it (see Figure 5-16 for an example). 
Your messages, and those of your friend, will be displayed in the main part 
of the conversation screen. Ending a conversation is easy too—just close the 
conversation window.

73
Figure 5-16: Chatting to friends using the Empathy IM client
I’ve only scratched the surface here. Empathy has lots of other features 
that you might want to try: You can send pictures and files to people, make 
phone and video calls, broadcast your location using geotagging, and even dis-
play your desktop on someone else’s computer screen. Explaining all of this 
would probably take a whole chapter on its own, so instead I’m going to point 
you at Empathy’s user guide, which should give you the lowdown on what 
else you can do and how you can do it. In any Empathy window, select Help
Contents, wait a few seconds for the help window to pop up, and then look 
through the list of topics until you find something relevant.
Telling People When You Don’t Want to Chat
Chatting is great, but very few people have the stamina to do it all day long. 
Once you’ve connected to an IM network, it can be annoying if people try 
to start conversations with you while you’re busy. Fortunately, there’s an easy 
way of letting everyone know that you don’t want to be disturbed.
On the top panel you should see your username next to a speech bubble 
icon. If you’re connected to an IM network, the bubble will be filled in with a 
solid color, which means that other people can tell that you’re online. Click 
the speech bubble icon, and choose a different status (Away or Busy, for 
example) from the menu that pops up (Figure 5-17). Depending on the status 
you choose, other people either will be told that you’re busy when they try to 
start a chat or won’t be able to see that you’re online at all. Peace and quiet, 
only a couple of clicks away.

Microblogging—Twitter and Friends
Blogging (writing an online diary/journal) is now a well-established Internet 
pastime. There are millions upon millions of blogs out there covering all sorts 
of subjects, from astronomy to economics to fluffy kittens. The quality of con-
tent varies wildly, but for the most part blog entries are typical newspaper-
opinion-column types of pieces. So, what if you had a blog where you were 
forced to write everything you wanted to say in less than 140 characters? That 
is the idea behind microblogging: making frequent, very short, bulletin-like 
posts.
Twitter is the most well-known microblogging website (http://www
.twitter.com/). People find all sorts of uses for Twitter: You can let your friends 
know what you’re up to at the moment, receive breaking news, discuss popular 
topics with other users, write posts using your mobile phone . . . the list goes 
on. I just followed a Twitter conversation between a few of my friends who 
were watching a live hockey game. They sent messages every time something 
exciting happened, so I could follow the action textually, within seconds of it 
happening. News travels fast on Twitter.
Perhaps it’s the sort of thing you need to try to appreciate, so if you don’t 
have an account already, click the Sign up now button on the Twitter home 
page, and follow the instructions. Once you’ve done that, take a look around 
the website to see how things work. The basic idea is that you post messages 
(tweets) for your followers to see. People can choose to follow you by clicking a 
button when they view your user profile. You can choose to follow other peo-
ple too—when you do this, all of their tweets will be displayed on your 
Twitter home page for you to read. Most people follow a few people and 
typically have a handful of followers themselves, but there are no restrictions 
on how many of each you can have.

Ubuntu’s portal to the world of microblogging is called Gwibber, which 
was first mentioned in Chapter 3. Let’s get it set up so you can see what it 
can do:
1.
Select ApplicationsInternetGwibber Social Client to start Gwibber. 
Since this is the first time you’ve run it, the Accounts window will be 
shown, asking what sort of account you’d like to add.
2.
Several types of account are available, but I’ll use Twitter in this example. 
Select Twitter from the drop-down list, and click the Add button just 
below it.
3.
A Twitter account screen will appear like the one in Figure 5-18. Enter 
your Twitter username and password, and then click the Add button on 
the right side of the window.
4.
A new account will be displayed in the list on the left side of the Gwibber 
Accounts window. Click Close to finish adding accounts.
Figure 5-18: Entering your Twitter account details
Now it’s time to get microblogging! Click the indicator applet (the enve-
lope icon), and select Broadcast from the list that pops up. The Gwibber 
window will appear and should look something like the one in Figure 5-19. 
Tweets from other users are shown in the main pane. If there’s nothing in 
there, you probably need to go to the Twitter site and start “following” some 
people—just click the Follow button on their profile page, and any posts they 
make will turn up for you to read in Gwibber.
To send your own tweets, type something into the message box at the 
bottom of the window: Ubuntu is awesome, for example. You’re allowed a maxi-
mum of 140 characters per tweet, and the number of characters you have 
remaining is displayed in the bottom right of the box. When you’re happy 
with what you’ve written, click Send to post the message for everyone to see. 
Do this as often as you like; you can tweet away all day!

Figure 5-19: Viewing recent tweets in the main Gwibber window
Twitter isn’t solely a broadcast medium, and you can converse with other

a couple of buttons will appear inside it. Click the one that looks like an enve-
lope with an arrow next to it, and that person’s username will appear in the 
message box, sandwiched between an @ sign and a colon (Figure 5-20). This 
is how you reply to someone else’s tweet—just type your message as normal, 
but after the colon.
The other button, which looks like a set of cogs and gears, displays a menu 
when you click it (Figure 5-21). Retweet is an interesting option from that menu—
click it, and you’ll post a copy of the message for all your friends/followers 
to see. This is how Twitter users share links and spread news throughout the 
network. It’s often the case that you hear about something cool from the friend 
of a friend of a friend, all thanks to these retweets.
If you’re finished with Gwibber for now, just close the window. You can 
easily open it again by clicking the envelope icon, as you did earlier.

Other Internet Applications
What I’ve covered thus far in terms of Internet applications is just the tip of 
the iceberg (might as well use that worn-out phrase before there aren’t any 
icebergs left, right?). There are still more Internet applications that you might 
want to consider downloading and installing after you’ve completed Chapter 6, 
including Liferea (a stand-alone RSS feed reader) and Miro (an Internet TV 
browser). If this all sounds enticing, get those fingers of yours flipping—the 
mother lode awaits!

Downloading, Installing, and Updating Programs the Easy Way
One of the handiest things about Ubuntu 
is that it is equipped with a very simple-to-
use application installation mechanism. The 
engine behind this is called Advanced Package 
Tool (APT), which allows you to easily download, install, 
update, and remove software packaged in DEB archives, 
or packages.
APT is a rather foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go miss-
ing, since it automatically downloads and installs any files that the main appli-
cation you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called 
dependencies, proves to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The 
painful quest of finding and then installing this file or that, as well as any 
dependencies that those files themselves might have, has led to the missing 
dependency problem being referred to as dependency hell. APT makes that 
pretty much a thing of the past. 
So, where does APT find all these files and applications? Well, the packages 
that APT searches for, downloads, and installs are located in a set of specific 
online repositories. These repositories are online servers in which a great number 

80
Chapter 6
of applications, support files, and more are stored for use with your particular 
system. All of the files that originally came bundled with your system, includ-
ing the system (kernel) itself and updates, when available, are stored there 
too. This is quite unlike Windows or Mac OS, where you normally need to 
buy a CD or download an installer file from a website to get new software.
The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might 
consider a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means 
you control it via commands in a command Terminal. Fortunately, Ubuntu 
has a number of different graphical frontends for APT that allow you to 
bypass the command line and make everything about as easy as you could 
ever hope it would be. In this chapter, you will be focusing on three of these 
frontends.
By far, the easiest to use of the APT frontends is the Ubuntu Software Center. 
Being the most graphically satisfying of the frontends, it is especially useful 
when it comes to browsing for cool or handy applications. To get a feel for it, 
go to the Applications menu and select Ubuntu Software Center. The window 
that opens will look similar to Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1: The Ubuntu Software Center
As you can see, items in the Ubuntu Software Center are categorized 
pretty much in the same manner as in the Ubuntu Applications menu. If you 
click any of the department icons in the main pane of the window, you will 
jump to a list of all the items available for that category. Applications that 
you’ve already installed are marked with a green check mark over their icons, 
while those that are not installed just display the plain icon. Not surprisingly, 
Project 6A: Installing Applications via the Ubuntu 
Software Center

Rounding Out the Bird
81
you will find that the installed items within each category mirror those in 
the relevant submenu of the Applications menu. To see a list of all your 
installed programs, click the Installed Software item in the pane on the left 
side of the window.
6A-1: Selecting Applications for Installation
The Ubuntu Software Center can install multiple applications simulta-
neously, so to give it a whirl, you can try installing a few interesting applica-
tions in this section. Let’s start by selecting the very cool and decidedly 
useful address book application Rubrica (shown in Figure 6-2). To select 
Rubrica, click the Office department in the main pane of the window, 
scroll down the list of available applications, and double-click the Rubrica 
Addressbook item. A page containing information about Rubrica will be 
displayed. All you need to do now is click Install - Free and type your pass-
word if prompted. This will start the installation.
A progress indicator will appear on the page while Rubrica is downloaded 
and installed. Once the installation has completed, the Rubrica page will reload 
with a green check icon next to the word Installed to show that it was added to 
your computer successfully. That’s all there is to it! Select Applications
OfficeRubrica Addressbook to start the program.
Figure 6-2: Rubrica—a very cool address book
6A-2: Searching for Applications
Next up is Sound Converter (which I’ll talk more about using in Chapter 14). 
Scrolling through the list of programs can be tedious, so this time, try using 
the search feature: Type Sound Converter into the search box at the top right 
of the screen, and watch as the search results fly in. Sound Converter should 
appear at the top of the list of results, so select it and click Install. The instal-
lation will start like before—but this time, try clicking Get Software while the 
program is still installing. 

82
Chapter 6
All the installation magic will continue in the background, and you can 
still browse for other programs. No need to wait!
Finally, let’s add a useful utility by the name of Sysinfo (Figure 6-3), 
which is a system profiler that can tell you all sorts of things about your com-
puter. Just type sysinfo in the search box, click the Sysinfo search result that 
appears, and then click Install to add it to the installation queue. It’ll be 
installed as soon as the Ubuntu Software Center has finished dealing with 
Sound Converter.
You can run the applications you’ve installed by going to the Applica-
tions menu and looking in the submenu that matches the Ubuntu Software 
Center “department” where you found the program—that would be Office for 
Rubrica, Sound & Video for Sound Converter, and System Tools for Sysinfo.
Figure 6-3: Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo
6A-3: Uninstalling Applications
As you can see, installing applications via the Ubuntu Software Center is 
quite simple. And fortunately, it’s just as easy to uninstall them. Navigate to 
(or search for) the program you want to remove, click it once in the list, and 
click the Remove button that appears. Enter your password again if asked, 
and watch as the program is uninstalled.
Performing System Upgrades via Update Manager
The second graphical frontend for APT that I’ll cover in this chapter is Update 
Manager, which is used for updating your system. Updates are made avail-
able quite regularly and consist of newer versions of packages you already 
have installed. Most of the time a newer version will have been released 
because it fixes some security issue, but updates can also fix problems with 
software and introduce new features.
To get started, select SystemAdministrationUpdate Manager, and 
make sure that the Ubuntu Software Center isn’t currently installing or 
removing anything (you can’t use two APT frontends at the same time). 

Rounding Out the Bird
83
Once the Update Manager window appears (Figure 6-4), click the Check but-
ton to make sure the package information is as up-to-date as possible. You will 
then be prompted for your password. Type it, and after a short while, a list of 
all the available updates will appear in the Update Manager window.
Figure 6-4: Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager
If there are any applications you don’t want to upgrade, you can go 
through the list and uncheck the box next to their names. But for now, it’s 
safest to just leave all the boxes checked. Either way, once you’re ready, click 
the Install Updates button. The selected updates will then be downloaded 
and installed. Once the installation is complete, you will be notified in a sep-
arate window. Click Close in that window and in the Update Manager window 
to finish up. Depending on what you installed, another notification may 
appear telling you that you will have to restart your system in order for the 
changes to take effect. If so, it is best to be obedient and reboot.
How Often Should You Install Updates?
Ubuntu will check for updates every day, and the Update Manager window will 
appear on your desktop if it finds any. If this is happening too often and you 
find yourself being pestered by updates, select SystemAdministration
Software Sources. When the Software Sources window appears, select the 

84
Chapter 6
Updates tab (Figure 6-5), and under Automatic updates, change the Check 
for updates option to something else. Weekly updates should be fine.
You’ll find a couple of other interesting options there too. If you select 
Install security updates without confirmation, updates will happen automati-
cally, without any intervention from you. Alternatively, you can choose to have 
updates download in the background so they’ll be ready to install immediately 
when Update Manager pops up.
Figure 6-5: The Updates tab in the Software Sources window
If an Update Ruins Your Day . . . or System
Now, I don’t want to worry you too much, but one thing about massive sys-
tem updates is that afterward sometimes things just go all screwy, leaving you 
with all sorts of regrets and a mouthful of expletives just waiting to be 
uttered. This is a fact of life no matter what operating system you are using. 
It can happen in Windows, it can happen in Mac OS, and it can happen in 
Linux. Therefore, it is always a good idea to wait a bit before installing a 
seemingly major update and to check the user forums first to see whether 
there are any disaster stories about a particular update. Leaving a week 
between noticing an update and installing it should protect you from most 
rare mishaps, but there are no guarantees.
NOTE
To decide whether an update is “major,” look for updates with linux- in their name 
(linux-generic, for example, as seen in Figure 6-6). These are important system 
packages and are the ones most likely to cause problems.

Rounding Out the Bird
85
Figure 6-6: Updates with linux in their name are usually important system packages
If you install an update only to find that your system won’t start up again, 
don’t worry. All is not lost. In fact, nothing is lost . . . most likely. Just start up your 
machine again. If you have a dual-boot system, you will arrive at the GRUB boot 
menu, just like always. If you’re not a dual-booter, you’ll have to get to this menu 
by holding down SHIFT as soon as you start the computer. Don’t let go of the 
SHIFT key until the GRUB menu appears (or Ubuntu starts, in which case you 
missed your cue, and you’ll have to restart the computer and try again).
In the GRUB menu, you will see that you seem to have more than one 
Ubuntu system installed on your hard disk, which is true to some extent. For 
a short-term fix, you can take advantage of this by traveling back in time to 
the core system (the Linux kernel) that you had in place before your ill-fated 
upgrade. Just use your arrow keys to select a kernel that ends in a number 
lower than the highest (2.6.32-20 rather than 2.6.32-22, for example), press 
ENTER, and voilá, you are back to the system you have come to know and love. 
You’ll have to do this each time you start up your machine, but at least you 
will have the chance to back up your valuable files before doing some research 
on the problem and trying again later.
With all this disaster and recovery talk, I hope I haven’t scared you away 
from the idea of updating your system. After all, chances are great that noth-
ing like this will ever happen to you. Still, it is good to know that if things do 
go awry, there is no need for panic. You’ve got backup.

Chapter 6
Adding Extra Software Repositories
The Ubuntu software repositories contain more than 30,000 packages—
enough to last a lifetime, or so you might think. But as it turns out, a whole 
world of software is waiting for you outside the official Ubuntu repositories, 
and it’s not much more difficult to reach. Various individuals and companies 
compile small numbers of packages that are not available in Ubuntu into their 
own third-party repositories. These are typically free to access, if you can find 
them. All you need to do is tell APT to search for packages in one of these 
repositories as well as Ubuntu’s, and you’ll be able to get at the extra software.
Each repository has its own APT line. This is similar to a web address but 
contains extra information about the repository, which APT uses to figure 
out what sort of packages it contains. You’ll need to get the correct APT line 
from the website of the repository you’re trying to add, so let’s pick an exam-
ple to see how it works. Open Firefox, and head over to http://www.getdeb.net/
updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install. GetDeb specializes in making packages for 
software that hasn’t officially made it into Ubuntu yet. There should be some 
instructions on installing packages from GetDeb in a box at the top of the 
page, so skip to the second item in the list and find the APT line, which should 
look something like this: deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu lucid-getdeb apps. 
This follows the same format as all APT lines: the word deb, followed by a web 
address, followed by a couple of other words that specify which part of the 
repository should be checked by APT when it’s looking for programs. High-
light the APT line, right-click it, and select Copy from the pop-up menu.
While you’re in Firefox, you’ll also need to grab the repository’s GPG key 
(which I’ll explain more at the end of this section). It should be linked to from 
the same website you got the APT line from; in the case of GetDeb, go to http://
archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key; when the Opening getdeb-archive.key window 
opens, select Save File, and click OK to save the key file.
Now that you’re in possession of these vital bits of information, adding 
the repository to your system is pretty straightforward:
1.
Select SystemAdministrationSoftware Sources. Enter your password 
if asked, and then click the Other Software tab in the Software Sources 
window that appears.
2.
Click Add. You’ll be prompted to enter the APT line, so paste it into the 
box, and then click Add Source (Figure 6-7). A new entry should appear 
in the Other Software list.
3.
Select the Authentication tab, and click Import Key File. Use the window 
that appears to find the .key file you downloaded earlier. (It’s probably in 
your Downloads folder.)
4.
Select the .key file by clicking it once, and then click OK. Check the list of 
trusted software providers to make sure that the GetDeb Archive Auto-
matic Signing Key is now present, as it is in Figure 6-8.

Rounding Out the Bird
87
Figure 6-7: Entering the APT line for the GetDeb repository

GetDeb key is there
5.
Close the Software Sources window. You’ll be told that the information 
about available software is outdated, so click Reload to fetch the most 
recent package information. It might take a little while to download.
6.
Open the Ubuntu Software Center (or close it and then reopen it, if it 
was already open), and search for the program you wanted from the new 
repository. For instance, try searching for BookWrite, a fun little program 
to help you write your own novel. It should appear in the search results 
just like any other application, so you can install it in the usual way.
That was quite a few steps to go through, but that’s all there is to it. It 
beats driving to your local computer store to buy a new program, eh?

88
Chapter 6
One final note: Remember all that business about authentication and 
GPG keys? It was related to a security measure that checks whether the pack-
ages are from where you think they’re from. (In theory, it’s possible that 
someone could hijack a repository and put harmful fake packages in there.) 
If you don’t add the GPG key, the Ubuntu Software Center will refuse to dis-
play any of the packages from the repository since it won’t trust it. Having 
the GPG key isn’t enough to keep you completely safe from nasty surprises, 
though. You should always exercise caution when using a third-party (that is, 
non-Ubuntu) repository; make sure it’s trustworthy before you add it.
APT-URL: Installing from Websites
Now that you’ve added GetDeb to the list of available software repositories, you 
can take advantage of yet another APT frontend. Go to http://www.getdeb.net/, 
and click the Apps tab. Peruse the list of programs until you find something 
agreeable—I chose a time management application called hamster-applet—and 
click Install this now, just below its picture. Now you can click a link on a web-
site to install software, without needing to visit the Ubuntu Software Center!
A Launch Application screen will appear with the apturl option selected—
click OK, and enter your password if prompted. You’ll then be shown a win-
dow that looks like the one in Figure 6-9; click Install, and wait as the usual 
downloading-and-installing activity carries on. When it’s all over, hit Close in 
the window that appears, and go find your new program in the Applications 
menu (or wherever else it ends up). Quick and easy.
Figure 6-9: Installing a package from a website with APT-URL
Plenty of websites support APT links, but you won’t be able to download 
software from them unless you’ve added their repository on your computer, 
like you did with GetDeb. If the link is for a program that is already available 
in the Ubuntu repositories, however, this can be installed as normal, without 
any further messing around in Software Sources.
Many Ubuntu enthusiasts catch the programming bug and decide to come 
up with their own software. There are all sorts of little programs out there 
that someone has written to scratch an itch of theirs, and plenty of them are 
available to you, for free, if you know where to get them. Luckily, most of 
them can now be found in personal package archives (PPAs) on Ubuntu’s 
Project 6B: Installing Software from a PPA: OpenSonic

Rounding Out the Bird
89
project website, Launchpad. PPAs are miniature software repositories and 
are an easy way for people to share their home-brewed software with others 
(emphasis on the home-brewed—sometimes software from PPAs doesn’t work). 
You can find software in PPAs by visiting https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas 
and searching for what you want.
In this example, you’ll see how to install OpenSonic, an open source 
remix of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog game (see Figure 6-10):
1.
Type lucid games into the search box at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+ppas, and click Search to get underway.
2.
The first search result should be Games (Lucid), so click that link, and 
look at the section titled Adding this PPA to your system on the page that loads.
3.
Copy the bit that says ppa:falk-t-j/games—it’s a shortcut that you can use 
to add this repository, instead of having to use the more cumbersome 
APT line. (You can still see the APT line by clicking the Technical details 
about this PPA link, if you’re curious.)
4.
Select SystemAdministrationSoftware Sources, and select the Other 
Software tab.
5.
Click Add, and paste the PPA shortcut into the box provided. Then, click 
Add Source.
6.
This time, the GPG key will be added automatically, so you can close the 
Software Sources window now.
7.
Click Reload when prompted to update the package information, and 
then open the Ubuntu Software Center and install OpenSonic like you 
would any other package.
Figure 6-10: Playing OpenSonic

Chapter 6
This is just an example—PPAs aren’t only used by enthusiasts to distrib-
ute nostalgic games. Some Ubuntu developers use PPAs to make the latest 
versions of software available, albeit in an unofficial and untested manner. 
If a major new version of OpenOffice.org or Firefox comes out, for example, 
keep your ear to the Ubuntu forums (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/) to see 
whether someone has made the latest and greatest available through their PPA.
As you may recall, the applications you install from the various repositories via 
the Ubuntu Software Center are in the form of DEB packages. And although it 
might seem that these repositories contain just about every piece of software 
possible, certain packages, for one reason or another, will never find their way 
into a repository. Skype is one of these packages.
Skype, shown in Figure 6-11, is Voice over IP (VoIP) software that allows 
you to speak to other Skype users over the Internet, with the clarity of a regular 
telephone line. And the best part is, it doesn’t cost anything—even if you call 
users overseas. Skype also offers paid services, such as SkypeOut, which allows 
you to call regular mobile and landline telephone numbers from your com-
puter at a fraction of what it would normally cost from a regular telephone.
Figure 6-11: Skype
Project 6C: Installing DEB Packages Not Available via the 
Ubuntu Repositories: Skype

Rounding Out the Bird
91
Although it is true that open source VoIP packages such as Ekiga Softphone 
are available in Ubuntu, they are not compatible with the much better known 
and more widespread Skype. Since it is very likely that the majority of people 
you know who are using a VoIP software package are using Skype, it only 
makes sense to use Skype so that you can easily communicate with them.
Because Skype is not available from the Ubuntu repositories, you will 
need to get it yourself from the Skype website (http://www.skype.com/). Once 
there, click the Download button, which will automatically take you to the 
download page for Linux versions of Skype. On that page, click the link for 
Ubuntu, and then click the Save File button in the window that appears.
Once the download is complete, you will find the Skype DEB package on 
your hard disk, probably in your Downloads folder. Double-click that package 
to open the Package Installer window (Figure 6-12). Click Install Package, 
after which you will be prompted for your password. Once the installation is 
complete, click the Close button in the window that appears and again in the 
Package Installer window.
NOTE
As is the case with all APT frontends, you cannot use Package Installer while another 
APT frontend is open. Make sure that Update Manager and the Ubuntu Software Cen-
ter are closed before using Package Installer.
Once all the pieces have been installed, you can run Skype by selecting 
ApplicationsInternetSkype. If you find that you can’t make calls or the 
sound doesn’t work properly, take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/
Skype/ for troubleshooting hints. Also, while we’re on the topic of sound, 
remember that it is best to use Skype with a headset. Trying to talk with a 
stick microphone could cause feedback or echoes, because the microphone 
will pick up and transmit sounds from the speakers.

File and Disc Handling in Ubuntu
No matter which operating system you are 
using, you have to deal with files. Some 
people are very organized, placing every file 
in a logically named folder as soon as that file 
is saved for the first time. Then there are people like 
me, who save everything to the desktop until it is so full 
of junk that they can no longer make out the wallpaper, 
and only at that point do they start organizing in earnest 
(if placing all of those files in a single folder called 
March17Cleanup can be called organizing).
Of course, not only do files get stored on your hard disk, but they are 
also copied to and from CDs, DVDs, external hard disks, flash drives, and 
other storage media and devices. They are also often saved in archives, which 
are then compressed to reduce their spatial footprint, making them easier to 
send via email or to fit onto removable storage media.

94
Chapter 7
With that introduction, you may have already guessed that in this chap-
ter I will be dealing with file handling in Ubuntu, particularly in relation to 
the Nautilus file manager, which is at the heart of GNOME’s file-handling 
capabilities. 
Nautilus: Your File Manager
As I mentioned, the program that creates the file viewing and organizing 
interface on your system is called Nautilus, and it comes as part of the GNOME 
desktop environment. You may not have thought of an operating system’s 
file manager as a program before, but in fact, that is what it is. (The Windows 
file manager is called Windows Explorer.) To take a look at Nautilus, just go 
to the Places menu, and select Home Folder. 
When Nautilus opens to your home folder (shown in Figure 7-1), you will 
find that you can store your files thematically: Documents, Downloads, Music, 
Pictures, Public, Templates, and Videos. There is also another folder, titled Desktop, 
which, if double-clicked, will show everything you have stored on your desk-
top (a lot in my case; most likely nothing in yours). There is also another 
folder, called Examples, which contains sample files that give you an idea of 
what Ubuntu has in store for you.
You can create additional folders and files to your heart’s content, so this 
preconfigured state of affairs is sure to change once you get down to really 
using your system. In fact, you will be making some changes in Chapter 8, 
which will make everything look a bit more lived in.
Figure 7-1: The contents of your home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window

A Tidy Nest
95
The Side Pane
Nautilus has a lot of interesting features that deserve mention, and the most 
obvious of these is the side pane, which appears at the left side of the win-
dow. The side pane allows you to view a variety of information via selectable 
views. You can make your choices by clicking the drop-down menu at the top 
of the side pane (Figure 7-2). 
Figure 7-2: Selecting views for 
the Nautilus side pane
The default view in Ubuntu is Places, which is a sort of quick navigation 
tool. In Places you will find icons representing various data-storage locations 
available to your system, such as your home folder, desktop, full filesystem, 
any network shares you are connected to (more on that in a moment), and any 
removable storage media or devices you have in or connected to your system. 
Clicking any of these icons will show the contents of that location in the right 
panel of the Nautilus window.
There are, of course, other views, such as Tree, which provides you with 
an expandable hierarchical view of your filesystem, and History, which shows 
you where in your filesystem you have been most recently, much in the way 
the history function works in a web browser. There are still other views for 
you to choose from, a couple of which you will work with in Chapter 8.
Now You See It; Now You Don’t
The side pane is a rather handy feature, but sometimes you may prefer to 
have more space to view the contents of your window and thus want to get rid 
of the pane temporarily. You can do this quite easily by clicking the little gray 
close button in the upper-right corner of the pane or by going to the View 
menu of a Nautilus window and then deselecting Side Pane. The check mark 
next to that entry will then disappear, as will the side pane. To get it back, 
just return to the View menu, and select Side Pane again. The check mark 
will then reappear, as will the side pane itself.

96
Chapter 7
There is another way to hide the side pane that many people seem to 
stumble upon accidentally, usually resulting in a bit of unnecessary panic. If 
you look at the gray border at the right side of the side pane, you will notice 
that there is a small ribbed section in the center (see Figure 7-3). Dragging 
this ribbed section allows you to resize the width of the pane. What most folks 
don’t realize straight off, however, is that simply clicking that ribbed section 
acts as a toggle to hide or show the side pane. When the pane is hidden in this 
way, the ribbed section still appears at the left border of the window, which is 
not true when the pane is hidden in one of the ways mentioned earlier.
So there it is—the side pane’s little secret. No, it’s not a particularly 
interesting secret, but it’s one that should provide you not only with an 
added layer of convenience but also with some peace of mind. 
Figure 7-3: Another way of showing and 
hiding the Nautilus side pane
File Handling in Nautilus
Since Nautilus is primarily a file manager, it only makes sense to get down to 
the business of using it at that level. Of course, most folks who use computers 
today are already familiar with the basics of drag-and-drop and a few other 
means of creating folders and copying, cutting, and moving files. But for those 
who are unfamiliar with one way or another of performing these essential 
procedures, I’ll spell it all out. If you find this all a bit redundant, please bear 
with me for the good of the masses.
Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders
Creating a folder is a simple enough task, and there are two ways of going 
about it. The easiest (in my opinion) is to right-click any empty space within 
a Nautilus window, and select Create Folder in the pop-up menu that appears. 

A Tidy Nest
97
If you prefer using menus over right-clicking empty space, you can instead 
start things rolling by selecting FileCreate Folder.
Regardless of where you made your Create Folder selection, a new folder 
with the name untitled folder will appear in the Nautilus window. The name 
box of the folder will be highlighted and surrounded with a black box, which 
means you can immediately give that folder a name by simply typing one—
nothing to click or do other than that. Press ENTER, or click any open space 
in the Nautilus window to complete the job.
If you later decide that the name you gave your folder needs some tweak-
ing or even a complete revision, you can rename it by right-clicking it and 
selecting Rename in the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can click the folder 
once to highlight it and then select EditRename. After that, you can type 
the new name for the folder and then press ENTER, or you can click any open 
space in the Nautilus window to seal the deal.
Moving Files and Folders
Perhaps the easiest of all file manipulations you can perform in Nautilus is 
moving a file by means of drag-and-drop. I am pretty sure that anybody who 
has wielded a mouse is familiar with that particular move. There is another 
way of moving files and folders, however: cut and paste. 
The easiest way of doing this is to right-click the file (or folder) you want 
to move and then select Cut from the pop-up menu (EditCut will also do 
the trick). At this point, it will seem as if nothing has happened, because the 
file will still be there, but don’t worry. 
After that, right-click any open space in the folder to which you want to 
move the file, and then select Paste in the pop-up menu. The file will then 
disappear from its original location and appear in its new one. 
Can you use key combinations to do this? Sure. Simply follow the direc-
tions I just gave, but press CTRL-X to cut and CTRL-V to paste. 
Copying Files and Folders
Based on the instructions I just gave, you can pretty well imagine the methods 
for copying files and folders, because they are essentially a variation on the 
same theme. Just right-click the file you want to copy, select Copy from the 
pop-up menu, right-click any open space within the target location, and then 
select Paste. Keystroke-wise, that would be CTRL-C to copy and, as before, 
CTRL-V to paste. 
It is also possible to copy folders and files via the wonders of drag-and-drop, 
though this involves more hands than required for a simple drag-and-drop 
move; fortunately, the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold the 
CTRL key while you drag the file or folder you want to copy to the target loca-
tion. Be sure to release the mouse button and then the CTRL key (releasing in 
the opposite order will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its 
new location.

Navigating in Nautilus
Navigating through your various folders and subfolders in Nautilus is quite 
straightforward. In fact, all is conceptually pretty much the same as what you 
are accustomed to in Windows and Mac OS. You can simply move into and 
out of folders through a combination of double-clicking folders and clicking 
the Back, Forward, and Up buttons.
Browsing with Breadcrumbs in Nautilus
In addition to the hierarchical view option provided in the side pane, another 
handy feature can make your navigation chores even easier: Nautilus’s bread-
crumb bar feature. As you wander ever deeper into your forest of folders, 
Nautilus will leave a trail of breadcrumbs (they look like buttons, actually) in 
the navigation bar for each folder you opened on the way to the one you are 
currently viewing. 
Say, for example, that you have a folder called gooseberries inside a folder 
called Dalarna inside a folder called SwedeStuff inside a folder called NordicStuff, 
which itself is in your home folder. As you click your way to that gooseberries 
folder, starting by double-clicking the NordicStuff folder, Nautilus will display 
a button for that folder . . . and any folder opened before it. Take a look at 
Figure 7-4 to see what I mean.
Figure 7-4: Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus
As you can see, there is a button for each of the folders within the path 
from your home folder to your target: gooseberries. So what, right? Well, say 
you want to go back to the NordicStuff folder to open a file in which there’s 
some text that you want to copy and then paste into a document within the 
gooseberries folder. That sounds like a minor pain, right? 
Well, rather than goof around with the Back button, just follow the 
breadcrumbs! Simply click the NordicStuff breadcrumb button, and the con-
tents of that folder will be there before you. Need to go back to gooseberries? 
Just click the gooseberries button. Back to SwedeStuff, you say? Just click the 
SwedeStuff button. All quite fantastisk!

Spelling It Out—Typing File Paths in Nautilus
If you prefer typing to clicking, you will be happy to know that you can navi-
gate to a folder by typing its path. Just click the Go menu and select Location 
(keyboard shortcut lovers can press CTRL-L instead). A box will then appear 
in the location bar (Figure 7-5) showing the current location, which, in the 
case of my berried example, would be /home/rg/NordicStuff/SwedeStuff/Dalarna/
gooseberries. You can type the path to your target folder in that box and then 
press ENTER, after which the contents of the target folder will appear below in 
the main pane of the Nautilus window. 
Figure 7-5: Typing the path to your target folder
Bookmarks Within Nautilus
With all this clicking away to deeply buried subfolders, it is worth mentioning 
another very handy feature of Nautilus: bookmarks. Yes, Nautilus lets you 
bookmark folders to which you have navigated. Although you are no doubt 
familiar with creating bookmarks for web pages that you frequent, you may 
be wondering why on Earth you would want to create bookmarks within your 
filesystem.
Well, imagine that you have a folder you need to use often, but it is even 
more buried away than my gooseberries folder in the previous section. Getting 
there would take an excessive number of mouse clicks, and all that clicking is 
bound to eventually give you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Although 
that is great for your doctor, it is most decidedly not good for you. Instead of 
maiming yourself, you could click your way to that folder once and then, in 
the Nautilus window, select BookmarksAdd Bookmark. After that, whenever 
you want to get back to that buried folder, you can just click the Bookmarks 
menu, and the folder will be right there waiting for you in the drop-down list. 
Another handy thing about Nautilus bookmarks is that they also appear 
in Save As dialog boxes, such as when you save an OpenOffice.org document 
or download a file via Firefox. To use them in any such Save As dialog box, 
just click the Save in folder button, and you will find your bookmarks.

Understanding the Linux Filesystem
With all that path typing, navigating, and bookmarking you’ve just been 
learning, you should pretty much be able to figure out how to get from here 
to there in your home folder. Still, it is probably a good idea to know where 
your home folder actually is in the scheme of things, just in case you manage 
to get yourself really lost someday. To understand this, you should have a 
basic understanding of the Linux filesystem that, as you will find, is a bit dif-
ferent from what you were accustomed to in your previous operating system. 
Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem all stems from a single point called 
root and is represented by a solitary forward slash (/). Your own user account 
folder is located within a subfolder of root called home. This is represented as 
/home or, to put it into words, the home folder within root. If your user account 
were to have the same name as mine, rg, the path to that folder would be /home/
rg, or the rg folder within home within root. Whatever the name of your user 
account or the names of any other accounts you have on your machine happen 
to be, just remember that when you are lost, your folder, and those for all the 
other folks with user accounts on your machine, are located within the home 
folder. If you’re a more graphically oriented person, the map in Figure 7-6 
should help you. 
Figure 7-6: The location of your users’ folders within the Linux filesystem

What’s in All Those Other Folders?
Needless to say, there is more to the Linux filesystem than the root, home, 
and user account folders. Several other directories appear at the same level 
as home, though for the most part, you shouldn’t be mucking around with 
them unless you know what you’re doing. Fortunately, most of these folders 
are write protected, so you should be fairly well protected from yourself. Still, 
it is natural to be curious about what those other folders are there for, since . . . 
well, they’re there. So, to satisfy your curiosity a bit, I’ll do a little explaining. 
In Ubuntu, four folders contain most of the applications on your system. 
The essential elements of your system are located in /sbin. Other elements that 
need to be there, though they may not be used, such as commands and the 
like, are located in /bin. Most of the applications that you actually think of as 
applications and use in a hands-on way are located in /usr. Finally, there are 
some add-on applications, such as RealPlayer, that install themselves into /opt.
Three other top-level folders that might be of interest to you are /etc, /lib, 
and /media. The first of these, /etc, is the location of all the configuration files 
on your system. The second, /lib, is the home of all of the libraries that are 
required by your system or applications installed on it. These libraries are the 
Linux equivalent of a Windows .dll file. Finally, /media is where the contents 
of your various attached external media (such as USB drives and CDs) appear 
when present.
There are other top-level folders, but their purposes are a bit less straight-
forward for the average Linux newbie and, to be honest, probably not all that 
interesting to you at this stage. Anyway, as I mentioned, there is no reason 
for you to be mucking around with any of these folders for the time being, 
because you can access the items located within them in different, and much 
safer, ways.
Using Nautilus as a Network Browser
Another handy Nautilus feature is its ability to function as a network browser. 
You can, for example, see what networks and shares are available to you on 
your home or office network by clicking Network in the side pane of the 
Nautilus window or by going to the Places menu in the GNOME panel and 
selecting Network. You can do the same from within a Nautilus window by 
going to its Go menu and selecting Network. Icons for any networks or com-
puters on that network would then appear in the Nautilus window, like in 
Figure 7-7. From that window, you can then double-click your way to a share 
that you have permission to access, such as the Shared Documents folder of a 
Windows machine or the public folders of a Mac. By the way, in case you are 
wondering what a share is, I’ll clear that up for you: A network share is a location 
on a computer, such as a folder, where other users on a network can access 
and save files. The Shared Documents folder on a Windows system is a good 

102
Chapter 7
example. Other users on a network can copy files from and (usually) write 
files to the Shared Documents folder, whereas they cannot access any other part 
of the filesystem on that host machine.
If the share you are trying to open requires a username and password, 
you will be asked for those in a new window. Note that, in this case, the user-
name and password you need to enter are those for the machine to which 
you are trying to connect—not the ones you’re using in Ubuntu (unless the 
usernames and/or passwords happen to be the same, of course). You can then 
copy files to and from that share as if it were a folder on your own hard disk.
Figure 7-7: Viewing the computers on your network
In some cases, especially when trying to access shares on a Mac running 
OS X, the double-click method will not work. You will not be able to access 
any share on a particular machine, even if an icon for that machine appears 
in the Nautilus window. In such cases, double-click the icon for the machine 
you are trying to access and then, once open (to an empty window), select 
GoLocation. A text box will appear in the location bar (just like in Figure 7-5) 
with the location of the machine you are trying to access already listed. 
To that location, add a forward slash (/) followed by the username used 
on the target machine. For example, if the target machine is called cowboycats 
and the username is mewtoyou, the location would be smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou. 
You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the machine, as 
long as you know the path to that folder, by adding to the path you’ve already 
typed; smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou/Documents, for example. If you prefer, you can 
type smb:// and your Mac’s IP address, which consists of a set of four numbers 

A Tidy Nest
103
separated by periods. In the case of one of my machines, I would type smb://
192.168.0.100. (You can find a Mac’s IP address by going to the Mac’s System 
Preferences, clicking Sharing, and then clicking Windows Sharing. The address 
should appear immediately below the service selection pane.)
NOTE
In case you are wondering, the smb at the head of that path stands for server message 
block, but to make things easier (and perhaps more useful in terms of your memory), 
you can just think of it as being short for Samba, which is software used by Unix-based 
systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X) in order to interact with Windows networks.
Once you’ve made your way to the folder you want to browse on the 
networked machine you’ve connected to, it might be a good idea to use the 
bookmark function in Nautilus to bookmark that open share window. You 
can then easily access that share in the future by choosing the share’s name 
in the Nautilus Bookmarks menu. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself. 
Using Nautilus as an FTP Client
Not only does Nautilus allow you to browse and mount shares on local net-
works, but it can also act as a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client, say when 
you want to change the files for your website on a remote server. To do this, 
go to the Connect to Server window (FileConnect to Server), and then 
select FTP (with login) for the service type. Then type the information pro-
vided by your website host, and click the Connect button. An FTP Network 
Share icon will then appear on the desktop and in the side pane. Double-
click that icon, type your password (for that account—not the one for your 
Ubuntu system, unless it happens to be the same) when prompted to do so, 
and then you will be able to view and add to the files you have there. 
File and Folder Permissions Within Nautilus
As you make your way in the world of Ubuntu, you will find that occasionally 
you’ll come across files or folders that are in some way locked, in terms of 
your being able to read them, being able to alter them, or both. These read-
ability and alterability states are referred to as permissions.
Now, you may be wondering what the point of this permissions business 
is, so in order to help you understand, I will give you some examples of how it 
can be useful. Let’s say you have some files that you don’t want your spouse 
or kids to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas shopping list, for example. 
By denying read permission to those files or to a folder containing those files, 
no one would be able to sneak a peek unless they were savvy at changing per-
missions and had the permissions necessary to change permissions for those 
files or folders.
As another example, imagine you have a file that you have worked many 
hours on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might acci-
dentally ruin that file in some way, you could deny yourself write permissions. 
By doing this, you wouldn’t be able to save any changes you make to that file. 

104
Chapter 7
You would be given the Save As option, but if you wanted to change the file 
itself, you would have to change the permissions. When you place such restric-
tions on a file or folder, a lock emblem appears on the icon for it, as shown in 
Figure 7-8.
Figure 7-8: Nautilus tells you when permissions 
restrict your freedom of movement.
Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus
To change file or folder permissions in Nautilus, just right-click the file or 
folder in question, and then select Properties from the pop-up menu. Once 
the Properties window opens, click the Permissions tab, and you will see 
who the owner of the file or folder is and what you and others are allowed 
or not allowed to do with it. As you can see in Figure 7-9, the options for fold-
ers and files are slightly different.
Figure 7-9: Changing permissions in a Nautilus Properties window for files and folders
You might find this permissions business a bit confusing, but it is really 
quite simple to understand. Permissions can be granted or denied to the owner 

A Tidy Nest
105
of the file or folder (you), to a specified group, or to others (everybody else). 
Traditionally, these permissions are referred to as follows:
Read
Permission to view the contents of a file or folder
Write
Permission to alter the contents of a file or folder
Execute
Permission to run a program or script
Nautilus has tried to spell things out a bit more, as you can see in Figure 7-9. 
In general, however, you needn’t worry all that much about setting permis-
sions for your own files, because you are really the only one who has access to 
your user account. One possible exception you might run into is when you 
transfer files from CD to your hard disk. In this case, the files will be write 
protected, meaning you cannot alter the files until you change the permissions 
for them. You can change the permissions of such files in order to allow your-
self to alter them by going to the Owner section of the Properties window and 
selecting Read and write in the menu next to the word Access (for files) or 
Create and delete files in the menu next to the words File access (for folders). 
Once you are done, click the Close button, and you’ll be on your way.
Keeping Your Home Folder Private
Another exception to my you-don’t-need-to-worry-about-permissions claim, 
and a potentially important one at that, is the state of permissions for your 
home folder, particularly when other people have user accounts on your 
machine. In Ubuntu, when someone logs in to their own account on your 
computer, they can click their way to your user folder and view its contents. 
To remedy this situation—and thus protect the sanctity of your home 
folder, the privacy of its contents, and the peace of mind of its owner (you)—
you can change the permissions of your home folder. Here’s what you need 
to do:
1.
Open a Nautilus window, and then click File System in the side pane. 
The contents of your entire hard disk will then appear in the right pane 
of the Nautilus window.
2.
Look for and then double-click the folder named home. When the con-
tents of the home folder you just clicked appear in the right pane, there 
should be only one folder there—your own folder, which will have the 
same name as your own username. For example, mine, as I mentioned 
earlier, is named rg. 
3.
Right-click your folder, and then select Properties in the pop-up menu.
4.
In the username Properties window (mine says rg Properties), click the 
Permissions tab.
5.
In the Permissions tab, go down to the Group and Others sections, and 
select None in the drop-down menus next to the words Folder access. Be 
sure to do this in both the Group and Others sections. When you’re done, 
your window should look like mine in Figure 7-10. If so, click Close.

folder for privacy
Reading Data CDs and DVDs
Dealing with data CDs and DVDs in Ubuntu is quite simple, because every-
thing is automatic. To read a CD or DVD with data on it, rather than music 
or video, place the disc in your drive, and a CD or DVD icon (they look the 
same) will automatically appear on the desktop and, if you have a Nautilus 
window open, in the side pane. You can double-click either of those icons, 
after which the disc’s contents will appear in Nautilus. After that, you can 
copy files from the CD or DVD to your hard disk using standard drag-and-
drop or copy-and-paste procedures. 
When you want to remove the CD or DVD, just right-click the desktop 
icon for that disc or the icon for that disc in the side pane, and then select 
Eject in the pop-up menu. The disc will be ejected automatically. 
Burning Data CDs and DVDs
Burning data CDs and DVDs in GNOME is extremely easy, as long as you 
have a CD or DVD burner hooked up to your computer! All you have to do is 
place a blank CD-Recordable (CD-R) or DVD (DVD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD+RW 

A Tidy Nest
107
are all supported by Ubuntu) in your drive, making sure to select a media 
format supported by your drive, and a Blank Disc window will appear asking 
what you want to do. Just click OK to open Nautilus’s CD/DVD Creator win-
dow, which as you no doubt notice looks pretty similar to other Nautilus win-
dows, save for the colored band below the location bar and the Write to Disc 
button (Figure 7-11).
Figure 7-11: A Nautilus CD/DVD Creator window with files ready to be burned to disc
Once the CD/DVD Creator window is open, copying the files you want to 
burn to disc is pretty much a simple drag-and-drop maneuver. Just open a new 
Nautilus window, and drag the files you want to burn to disc from that window 
to the CD/DVD Creator window. If you prefer to do things in a decidedly 
Windows-esque fashion, you can select the files you want to transfer to disc by 
clicking each file once, holding down the CTRL key while doing so, for multiple 
selections. If you want to select multiple consecutive files, you can click the 
first file in the group, press and hold SHIFT, and then click the last file in the 
group, automatically selecting all the files in between. Once you’ve made your 
selections, release the CTRL or SHIFT key, right-click any of the highlighted 
files, and select Copy in the pop-up menu. After that, go back to the CD/DVD 
Creator window, right-click any open space, and then select Paste in the pop-
up menu.
It is probably worth mentioning that the files you copy to the CD/DVD 
Creator window are not actually copied. Instead, what you see in the CD/
DVD Creator window are essentially links pointing to the original files in 
their original locations. Thus, if you move one of the files from its original 
location before burning the contents of the CD/DVD Creator window to 
disc, the link won’t work any more and the file won’t be copied onto the disc. 
This isn’t too much of a problem, since all of the other files will be put onto 
the disc correctly, but it is something worth being aware of.

108
Chapter 7
Once you have copied all the files you want to burn to disc, click the 
Write to Disc button, after which a window (shown in Figure 7-12) will appear, 
telling you, among other things, how many megabytes of files you can still add 
to the disc (click Cancel to go back and add more if you want). Most people 
are happy to accept the default options (which are pretty sensible), so all that 
remains is to choose a more interesting name for the disc. However, if you’d 
rather not leave anything to chance, you can adjust the speed at which your 
disc will be burned (a slower speed means fewer chances for errors) by click-
ing Properties and picking a slower speed.
Once you are ready to burn the disc, just click the Burn button, and the 
CD/DVD Creator will do its work.
Figure 7-12: Setting options before burning a CD or DVD
NOTE
If you intend to transfer the files to a Windows system, make sure you rename your files 
according to Windows naming conventions before you get down to the actual burning. In 
particular, avoid special characters and diacritics (such as umlauts and accents), and do 
not use the following characters, which are reserved for Windows system functions:
/ : ? * '' < > |.
Once the burning gets under way, its progress will be shown in a new 
window, and when the job is done, you will be asked what you would like to 
do next. Assuming you are done with your disc burning for the day, click 
Eject and then Close. 
In case you are wondering, the discs you burn in Linux will be readable 
in other operating systems.
Dealing with CD-RWs 
CD-RWs are pretty much like CD-Rs except that they can be erased and then 
written to again. They are also quite a bit more expensive than CD-Rs and, 
generally, cannot handle faster burning speeds. 
Using CD-RWs is much like working with CD-Rs. If the disc is blank, there 
is no difference in the process at all, which makes things quite simple. And, 
even if the CD-RW already has data on it that you want to replace with some-
thing else, the process is only slightly different. 

A Tidy Nest
109
One of these differences is that Nautilus will treat your CD-RW as a regu-
lar data disc rather than a blank one. This means that when you pop your 
disc into the drive, a regular Nautilus window will automatically open, rather 
than a CD/DVD Creator window. 
To write to the disc, you will need to manually switch from the Nautilus 
window to a CD/DVD Creator window, which is easily done by selecting 
CD/DVD Creator in the Go menu of the Nautilus window opened for that 
disc. If you can’t see a CD/DVD Creator option, click GoLocation and type 
burn:/// into the location bar (followed by ENTER) instead. Once you’ve done 
this, the window will become a CD/DVD Creator window. Now drag the files 
you want to burn to CD to that window; once you are ready to burn, click the 
Write to Disc button.
As is the case with regular CD-Rs or DVDs, a CD/DVD Creator window will 
appear. When you click the Burn button in that window with a used CD-RW 
in the drive, however, a slight difference occurs. At this point, a new window 
like that in Figure 7-13 will appear telling you that the disc seems to have files 
already written on it. Click the Blank Disc button in that window, and the 
CD/DVD Creator will erase the files already on the CD-RW and replace them 
with the new ones that you dragged to the CD/DVD Creator window. Not 
bad at all, eh?
Figure 7-13: Erasing a CD-RW with Nautilus
Burning ISO Images to Disc
When you download Ubuntu or other Linux distributions from the Internet, 
you usually download them in the form of one or more disc images, which 
are commonly referred to as ISOs because such files end in the .iso extension. 
An ISO is an image of a CD’s file contents, which means that it is the CD 
minus the media itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the ISO 
would be the soul of a CD; take away the CD’s metal and plastic, and the 
remaining data would be an ISO. 
Because it is impossible to download a physical CD over the Internet, the 
bodiless ISOs are the next best thing. For example, to get a working copy of 
Ubuntu from the Web, you usually need to download an ISO, which you 
then burn onto a blank CD in order to give the images their bodies back, so 
to speak. In the process, you create the working installation disc that you 
need to install Ubuntu. 

110
Chapter 7
Fortunately, burning an ISO to disc is a pretty simple chore. Just open a 
Nautilus window, and locate the icon for the ISO file you want to burn to disc. 
Right-click the ISO file, and in the pop-up menu that appears, select Write to 
Disc. Once you do this, the Write to Disc window will appear; just click the 
Burn button, and you’ll be on your way.
Creating Your Own ISO Images
While on the topic of ISOs, it is good to know that you can create ISOs of 
your own. Of course, you’re probably not going around creating your own 
Linux distros, but you might come up with a set of files that you need to 
repeatedly burn to disc now or in the future. To create your own ISO, follow 
the normal process for creating a data CD, but when the Write to Disc win-
dow (Figure 7-12) appears, select Image File in the drop-down menu below 
the words Select a disc to write to. After that, click Properties, which will open a 
new window asking for a filename for your new disc image. Give it a name, 
click Close, and hit the Burn button. In a very short time, you will have an 
ISO of your own creation.
Burning Multisession CDs
If you are coming from the Windows environment, you are no doubt familiar 
with multisession CDs. These are CDs on which data is added one session at a 
time. For example, you burn a few files to disc today and add a few more to 
the disc tomorrow and a few more files the day after that. Each time you burn 
additional files to the same disc, you are adding a session, which explains the 
name multisession. If that explanation seems a bit obtuse, you can basically 
think of them working like floppy disks (albeit with considerably more stor-
age capacity).
Nautilus has basic support for multisession discs, but let’s try something 
a little more specialized this time: Brasero, which is a more fully featured 
application that you can use for all of your disc-burning chores.
You can run Brasero from the Applications menu by selecting Sound & 
VideoBrasero Disc Burner. In the main Brasero window that then opens, 
click the Data project button.
To burn the first session to a CD, drag the files you want to burn from 
Nautilus into the empty Brasero window (Figure 7-14), or click the Add button 
(which looks like a + ) on the Brasero toolbar to browse for files manually. 
When you have all the files in place that you want to burn, put a blank 
disc into the drive, choose a name for the disc using the box at the bottom 
of the screen, and click the Burn button. A Properties window will appear. In 
that window, check the Leave the disc open to add other files later box. (This 
is the step that sets up a multisession disc.) Once you’ve done that, click 
Burn to start the burning process. Brasero will eject the disc when the burn 
is complete.

A Tidy Nest
111
Figure 7-14: Using Brasero to create multisession discs
Burning Subsequent Sessions
Adding a new session to a multisession disc in Brasero is similar to the process 
used for creating the initial session. Here’s what you do:
1.
Run Brasero, and click the Data project button.
2.
Insert your multisession disc into the drive, and when the drive stops 
spinning and you’ve gotten any Nautilus windows for that disc out of the 
way, click the Import button, after which the contents of your previous 
session will appear in the Brasero window. 
3.
Add files to the previous session, using either of the methods you used 
when creating the original session (via drag-and-drop or by selecting and 
clicking Add).
4.
When you’ve added the files you want, click Burn. The process from then 
on out is exactly the same as it was for the first session. To add files in 
subsequent sessions, just follow the process outlined earlier yet again. 
Duplicating CDs and DVDs
Now that you are familiar with Brasero, I’ll introduce another of its features: 
CD/DVD duplication. To duplicate a disc, place it in the drive, start Brasero, 
and then click the Disc copy button. In the window that then appears (Fig-
ure 7-15), click the Copy button.
Brasero will begin copying your disc. When it’s done, it will eject the disc 
and ask you to insert a blank one. A few seconds after you insert the blank 
disc, Brasero will automatically start writing to it. When the process is com-

USB Storage Devices
Unless you have been under a digital rock for the past few years, you are no 
doubt well familiar with USB devices. Your printer is very likely a USB device, 
as is your scanner. And although your digital camera is not a USB device in 
the traditional sense, chances are that every time you connect it to your com-
puter in order to transfer photos, you are doing so via a USB connector. 
Among the most popular USB devices out there are those used for file 
storage. These include external hard disks, flash memory card readers, and 
the tiny, finger-sized devices known as flash drives (Figure 7-16). Flash drives 
are especially popular today and deservedly so: They are inexpensive, handy 
when you need to transfer large amounts of data, and pretty safe in terms of 
cross-platform (including Linux) compatibility.
Working with USB storage devices is really easy. Just plug the device into 
one of the USB ports on your computer. The LED on the device will do a bit 
of blinking while the system reads what’s on it, and after that, a disc icon 
for that device will appear on your desktop. A few moments later, a Nautilus 
window will open, revealing the contents of the device. An icon for the USB 
device will also appear in the side pane of the Nautilus window. You can then 
copy files to and from the device using the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste 
procedures I mentioned earlier in this chapter. 
Once you are done and want to remove the device, right-click its desktop 
icon, and select Safely Remove Drive in the pop-up menu. (You can also right-
click the icon in the Nautilus side pane and select the same option.) If there 
is any data that needs to be written to the device, the system will start writing. 
Once it’s complete, the icon for the device will disappear from the desktop 
and Nautilus folder. Make sure that you always safely remove USB drives like 
this, rather than simply disconnecting them—otherwise, you risk losing data.

Working with Bluetooth Devices
While we’re on the topic of file handling, it is probably a good time to learn 
how to work with Bluetooth devices. As I mentioned in Chapter 3, if you have 
a Bluetooth adapter in your machine, either built in or plugged into a USB 
port, a Bluetooth icon will appear in the right half of the GNOME upper panel. 
Pairing Devices
Before you can transfer files between your Bluetooth devices, you need to 
pair them. This is how you do it:
1.
Click the Bluetooth icon in the top panel, and select Set up new device. 
2.
In the Bluetooth setup wizard that appears, click Forward. 
3.
Ubuntu will then search for Bluetooth devices in the vicinity of your 
computer. Once it discovers a device, that device will appear in the center 
pane of the window, as in Figure 7-17. Once the device you want to pair 
to appears, click it, and then click the Forward button. 
4.
In the next page of the wizard, a personal identification number (PIN) 
will appear (Figure 7-18). An input window should also then appear in 
the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to. Input the PIN into that 
input box. 
5.
Assuming the pairing is successful, the final page of the wizard will then 
appear. Click Close to complete the pairing process.

Sending Files by Bluetooth
To send a file by Bluetooth from your computer to another Bluetooth-
capable device, click the Bluetooth panel icon, and select Send files to 
device. A window will then appear in which you can navigate to the target 
file. Once you have made your selection, click Open. The Select Device win-
dow will then appear (Figure 7-19). Select the recipient machine, and click 
Send to. Your machine will then begin transferring the file. If the recipient 
machine is set up to seek permission first before accepting a Bluetooth file 
transfer, you or the recipient will have to perform the appropriate action on 
the recipient machine before the transfer can be completed.
Figure 7-19: Selecting paired Bluetooth devices to receive sent files
Receiving Files by Bluetooth
To receive files via Bluetooth from another Bluetooth-capable device, you 
have to first set up your device to allow such transfers. To do this, click the 
Bluetooth panel icon, and select Preferences. In the Bluetooth Preferences 
window, click the device you want to set up, and then click Receive Files. A 
Personal File Sharing Preferences window will then appear. In that window, 
check the box next to the words Receive files in Downloads folder over Bluetooth. 
For your safety, select Only for set up devices in the drop-down menu button 
to the right of the words Accept files. Your window should then look like that 
in Figure 7-20. If so, click Close. Your machine will then automatically 
receive files sent to it via Bluetooth and save them to the Downloads folder.

sent from other Bluetooth devices.
Backing Up Your Files
You’ve worked hard to accumulate all of your files. Hours of typing, hundreds 
of photos, piles of music CDs—it’s all there on the hard disk. So, what hap-
pens to it if something goes wrong with your computer? In many cases the 
answer is, unfortunately, that all of the data is lost forever. To save you the 
pain of this experience, it’s a great idea to make regular backups.
Plenty of backup utilities are available, but Déjà Dup stands out to me as 
being the easiest to use. Open the Ubuntu Software Center, and install the 
Déjà Dup Backup Utility. It’ll put itself in the System Tools section of the 
Applications menu, so head over there and start it up.
Now is a good time to decide what you’re going to use to store your back-
ups. I have an external USB hard disk that does the trick, but you can use a USB 
flash drive, recordable CD or DVD, or even a web server. I wouldn’t recommend 
putting your backups on the same computer, though. The best policy is to 
put some distance between the original files and the backups, so if there’s a 
fire or some other disaster, you’ll have at least one copy of them left intact. 
Make sure you have enough space for the backup too; regular CDs are only 
700MB, but my Pictures folder alone weighs in at a whopping 4.3GB!
Connect, insert, or otherwise prepare your chosen backup device, and 
click the Backup button in Déjà Dup. A Preferences window will pop up like 
the one in Figure 7-21. Choose the location in which you’d like to save the 
backup files from the drop-down box. If you have sensitive files that you don’t 
want anyone snooping around in, check Encrypt backup files.

A Tidy Nest
117
Figure 7-21: Choosing where to save the backup files in Déjà Dup
NOTE
If you want to put your backup files on a CD or DVD, you’ll have to save them to a 
folder somewhere first and then copy that folder onto a disc using the burning software 
mentioned earlier this chapter.
Hit Forward, and you’ll be presented with the screen in Figure 7-22. 
Your first task is to decide what you want to back up, so check out the list 
labeled Include files in folders, which should have only your Home folder in it 
at the moment. This is a pretty sensible choice for most people, since abso-
lutely all of your files should be in your Home folder. You can add and remove 
other items as you please using the buttons to the right of the list. 
Figure 7-22: Selecting which files you want to backup
There’s another list on that screen, labeled Except files in folders. You can 
use this to define any files or folders that you don’t want to back up. Say, for 
example, that you wanted to back up everything in your Home folder except 
for your pictures—maybe you don’t have space on your backup disk for all 
of them. All you’d need to do is to make sure that your Home Folder is in the 
Include files in folders list and your Pictures folder is in the Except files in folders list.

118
Chapter 7
When you’ve chosen what to keep and what to ignore, click Forward 
again to get to the summary page. Check that everything looks hunky-dory, 
and click Backup to start the backup. If you chose to encrypt your backup, 
you’ll be asked to type a password, so do this and click Continue. 
Make sure you keep that password safe; otherwise, you won’t be able to 
recover your backed-up files at a later date! A flurry of file copying will ensue 
and may last for some time if you have lots of files to back up. Once that’s fin-
ished, click Close, and safely remove your backup disk (or whatever you have 
instead).
That should be it . . . for now. But remember, there’s little point in back-
ing up if you don’t do it regularly, since you’ll only be able to recover your 
older files (and not more recent ones) if something does go wrong. I make a 
backup about once a month, but I should probably do it more regularly than 
that. It’s not much of a chore; when you next use Déjà Dup, it’ll remember 
all of your settings from the previous backup. If you want to do something 
different, click EditPreferences in the main window, and change the options 
there. You’ll find options for automatically backing up as well; check the 
Automatically backup on a regular schedule setting in the Preferences window, 
and then choose how often you’d like the backup to happen. Click Close, 
and Déjà Dup should take care of the rest. 
NOTE
Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, now offers an online backup service called 
Ubuntu One. Take a look at https://one.ubuntu.com/ for more information on that.
Recovering from a Backup
Ideally you’ll never have to recover your backup, but if you do, here’s a 
quick guide:
1.
Find your backup disk, hook it up to the computer, and start Déjà Dup.
2.
Select EditPreferences, and make sure that the disk is selected as the 
Backup location. Click Close to get back to the main screen.
3.
Click Restore, and enter the password you chose for the backup if you 
encrypted it.
4.
You’ll be asked to choose which backup you want to restore. Choose the 
one that looks right (normally the most recent one), and click Forward.
5.
If you want the files to be put back exactly where they came from, choose 
Restore files to original locations. Otherwise, you can choose a folder to 
restore them to. Click Forward again.
6.
Glance over the summary to make sure everything looks OK, and click 
Apply to restore your files. There’s a chance that you might have to 
reenter your encryption password, so go ahead and do so if asked.
7.
Click Close once the restoration has finished, and check that the files 
have been put back correctly.
Everything should have returned to normal now. Phew!

Removing Unwanted Files
Remember all that talk of keeping a tidy nest at the start of the chapter? Well, 
now it’s time to dust off your spring cleaning gear and give your home folder 
the once over.
The first stop is the Trash. Sometimes I’m surprised by just how much 
stuff accumulates here; I can go for weeks on end without emptying it. Luck-
ily, this trash lacks the unpleasant odor of its real-world counterpart, so all 
that stands in your way is a quick check to make sure you didn’t accidentally 
throw anything away. Click the Trash icon on the bottom panel, and when 
the window opens, click Empty Trash to delete all the files in there. They will 
be deleted permanently, with no way of getting them back.
Next up is something a little more sophisticated. If you’re running low 
on hard disk space and want to know why (or just want to snoop around your 
files a little), select ApplicationsAccessoriesDisk Usage Analyzer. When 
the window appears, click Scan Home, and wait for a little while as your folders 
are sized up. A colorful ring chart will appear, accompanied by a list showing 
where all your hard disk space is being eaten up. Hover the mouse over one 
of the colored segments on the chart to see what’s taking up the most room, 
or double-click one of them to zoom in on a particular folder. After that, it’s 
up to you to weed out the hard disk hogs: Click a folder in the left list, and 
choose Move to Trash to delete it.
Since I have been talking about file storage, it seems only fitting to wrap things 
up in this chapter by teaching you how to create and extract compressed files. 
In the Windows world, these are generally referred to as Zip files, while in the 
Linux world, tarball is the operative name. The Linux name, in case you’re 
wondering, comes from the application that is used to create the archive for 
such files, Tar. Compressed archives are great for two reasons: They let you 
bundle a load of files together into one handy package, and they also squeeze 
all the files down so that they take up less space on your hard disk. If you’ve 
ever tried to email a bunch of files to someone, you know how useful this 
can be.
Anyway, to get some of the hands-on stuff down, you’ll be creating a 
Windows/Linux/Mac–friendly Zip file and then extracting it. You can get 
down to business by opening a Nautilus window and creating a couple of 
dummy files to work with. Do this by going to the Nautilus File menu and 
selecting Create DocumentEmpty File. A new file will appear in the Nautilus 
window, with its name highlighted. You can type a name for the file, such as 
the one I’m using: dogwood. Now repeat the process to create a second file. 
I’ll be calling that one violet. Use something equally evocative for yours. 
Project 7: Creating and Extracting Compressed Files

120
Chapter 7
Now that you have two files to work with, you can create the compressed 
archive by following these steps:
1.
Select the two files either by clicking your mouse to the side of the files 
and then dragging the cursor (with the mouse button still pressed) over 
both files until they are highlighted or by holding down the CTRL key 
and clicking each file individually.
2.
Once both files are highlighted, right-click either one, and select Compress 
from the pop-up menu. 
3.
In the Compress window that then appears, type blossoms in the Filename 
text box, and then select .zip from the drop-down menu button to the 
right of that. Once everything looks like what I’ve set up in Figure 7-23, 
click the Create button, after which a compressed archive of your two 
files (blossoms.zip) will appear in your home folder.
Figure 7-23: Creating a compressed archive
Now that you know how to put things together, let’s get back to work and 
learn the equally simple task of ripping it all apart—well, OK, extracting it:
1.
Drag the original dogwood and violet files to the Trash to get them out of 
the way.
2.
Double-click the blossoms.zip file you’ve just created. A window showing 
the contents of the file will then appear (Figure 7-24). 
Figure 7-24: Extracting a compressed archive

3.
In that window, click the Extract button, after which another window, 
Extract, will appear. 
4.
Click the Extract button in that window, and within a second (two at the 
most), you will find two new copies of dogwood and violet in your home 
folder.
Now you’ve created and extracted a compressed archive, which is in this 
case a Zip file. You can also create a compressed tarball in the future by fol-
lowing the same procedure (probably with real rather than dummy files), but 
when it’s time to select an archive type, select .tar.gz instead of .zip. Other 
than that single step, it is the same creation and extraction process.

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your System
Before entering the world of Linux, I had 
used just about every desktop operating sys-
tem around. Despite the differences among 
them all, however, one thing that I eventually 
suffered from in each case was a kind of visual boredom. 
I suppose you might call it GUI fatigue. It wasn’t that I 
was tired of using a graphical interface; it was just
that I couldn’t help but get sick of looking at the same old icons, window bor-
ders, and color schemes. Of course, there were some changes that could be 
made, but it just wasn’t possible to get around the basic look and feel without 
add-ons that demanded a price in terms of performance.
One of the features of Linux that pleased me to no end, and continues 
to do so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don’t mean 
just the icons and backgrounds but everything, including the actual window 
borders and controls. Add to that the variety of graphical desktop environments 
and window managers available for Linux, and you have a totally customizable 
system. Is it any wonder that there are so many more Linux desktop screenshots 

124
Chapter 8
on the Web than for any other system? If you don’t believe me, just take a 
look at a site dedicated to Linux screenshots, http://www.lynucs.org/, and click 
the Screenshots link.
You may not be as fickle as I am in terms of the look and feel of your system, 
but you can learn to use and enjoy all the graphical customization power that 
Linux offers you as you work through this chapter.
If you are reluctant to alter the look of your current setup, you can create a 
new user account and experiment with making the changes in this chapter 
when logged in to the new account. If you opt to go this route, your regular 
home environment will remain untouched, because look-and-feel customiza-
tions that are performed in one user account do not affect other user accounts. 
When you are all done with the project, you can then simply delete the new 
user account. Either way, it’s up to you.
8A-1: Creating the Account
To set up a new user account, follow these steps:
1.
Select SystemAdministrationUsers and Groups. 
2.
Once the Users Settings window appears, click Add. If asked for your 
password, type it into the box, and click Authenticate.
3.
In the Create New User window that appears (Figure 8-1), type a new 
username in the Short Name box; I’m using graphika for my example. In 
the Name field, you can type whatever you like; I’m using Graphics Lover.
4.
Click OK to add the new user. A Change User Password window will appear.
5.
The Set password by hand option should be selected. Type a password 
for the new user; you should put numbers and letters in the password to 
make it more difficult to guess. Retype the password in the Confirmation 
box to confirm your choice, and then click OK.
6.
You’ll be taken back to the Users Settings window (Figure 8-2). Select the 
new graphika account from the list on the left of the window, and then 
click the Change button next to where it says Account type.
7.
In the window that appears, give yourself the ability to install software 
and perform other administrative tasks in the new account by selecting 
Administrator. Click OK to return to the main Users Settings window.
8.
Click OK, and close the Users Settings window. The new account should 
be ready to use.
NOTE
Normally, the privilege to install software and perform other system-wide changes 
(Administrator) is not selected by default on new user accounts, since you probably 
don’t want your kids, workmates, or anyone else with their own user account on your 
computer installing all sorts of weird stuff and screwing up your system settings. We 
need it here because we’re going to be installing things, though.

Figure 8-2: The new user account displayed in the Users Settings window
8A-2: Logging In to Your New Account
To use this new account, click the power button at the far right of the top 
panel, and click Log Out. A countdown will appear, but you can skip that; 
just click the Log Out button. After a few seconds, you will be back at the 
login screen. Click your new username in that window, type the password for 
the account, and press ENTER. You will soon be at the new, untouched desk-
top of your just-created user.
When you log out of a user account, all the programs you have running 
will be closed—if you were planning to use a different account for only a few 
minutes, it can be annoying to have to open everything again when you get 

126
Chapter 8
back to the original account. Fortunately, there’s an alternative: You can tem-
porarily switch users. Switching users differs from the logout/login approach, 
in that you remain logged in to your original account while you log in to your 
other account (or while someone else with an account on your computer logs 
in to theirs). Going this route keeps all the windows and applications you have 
open. These windows will not appear in the account you are switching to, but 
they will be there, conveniently waiting for you, when you switch back to the 
account from whence you came.
This is a good way to proceed if you plan to be switching back and forth 
between your two accounts. It is also a good approach when, say, your child 
needs to log in to their account for a moment to do a quick email check, burn 
a CD to play on the way to the beach, or print a file for school. When your 
child is done, you can quickly get back to what you were doing without having 
to reopen files, web pages, or whatever else you happened to be dealing with 
at the time of the switch.
You can switch users quite easily by clicking the power button on the top 
GNOME panel and selecting the user account you want to switch to. After a 
few seconds you’ll be asked for the password for the account you selected, 
so type it into the box, and press the ENTER key. After that, you will be at the 
desktop of the selected user account.
To get back to your original user account after going the switch-user 
route, just click the power button, click the username from which you came, 
and after a few seconds of darkness, a window will appear into which you 
must type the user password of the account you are returning to. Type your 
password, click Unlock, and you will be back at your original desktop, with 
everything as it was when you last saw it, open windows and all. Pretty cool.
Whichever user account you’ve decided to play with, you are now ready for 
action. By the time we get to the end of the process, you will have created a 
much wilder and gaudier desktop environment than you’ve ever seen before. 
All of this is in good fun, of course, and when you are done, you should be 
able to completely and confidently customize things the way you want on your 
own. So, let’s go.
8B-1: Adding Emblems to Folders
One of the coolest things about Nautilus is that it allows you to add little 
folder-top icons called emblems. These emblems can graphically remind you 
what each folder is for, and they’re not only for folders—you can add them to 
files too. The look of these emblems also changes when you change your desk-
top themes, so you’re in for more visual excitement later in this chapter. For 
now, however, let’s learn how to use them by adding one to the Documents folder. 
Open your home folder, right-click Documents, and then select Properties in 
the pop-up menu. When the Properties window appears, click the Emblems 
Project 8B: Customizing Your Desktop Environment

Dressing Up he Bird
127
tab, and scroll down until you see the emblem called Personal (Figure 8-3). 
Click the checkbox next to it, and then click the Close button. The emblem 
should now appear on your folder.
Figure 8-3: Choosing emblems for your folders
Now, for additional practice, try adding the Sound emblem to your Music 
folder. Just use the same steps as before, and substitute the appropriate items 
and entries. When you’re finished, you should have a Music folder that is sur-
rounded by musical notes—one is the emblem, the other is the folder’s default 
icon. Not all folders have default icons, so that’s when emblems really come 
in handy.
8B-2: Setting Window Backgrounds (and Emblems Again)
Once you’ve added those two emblems, your folders should look a bit spunkier 
(and you’ll make those emblems look spunkier still later in the chapter). 
Nevertheless, the background of the Nautilus window is still plain and white. 
You need not stand for that if you don’t want to; you can change it as well. To do 
so, just go to your home window, click the Edit menu, and select Backgrounds 
and Emblems. The Backgrounds and Emblems window will then appear (see 
Figure 8-4).

128
Chapter 8
Figure 8-4: Choosing a background for your Nautilus window
From this window, you can drag any pattern into your home window, or 
into any other Nautilus window for that matter, and the pattern will then 
become the background for all your Nautilus windows. So, for experience’s 
sake, scroll down to find the pattern called Manila Paper, and then drag it to 
the whitespace in the main pane of your home window. Once you’ve done 
that, the previously white window area will look like the wallpaper in a law-
yer’s office. Very nice, if you like that sort of thing. You can change it to a 
different background in the same way, of course, or you can go back to the 
default white by dragging the Reset swatch into the window.
NOTE
If you prefer to use an image of your own for the Nautilus window background, you 
can do so quite easily. Just locate the image in a new Nautilus window, click it with 
both the left and right mouse buttons (or just the middle mouse button, if you have a 
three-button mouse), and then drag the image to any open space within the target win-
dow. When you release the buttons, select Set as Background in the pop-up menu that 
then appears.
In addition to the buttons for pattern and color swatches, there is a third 
button in the Backgrounds and Emblems window called Emblems. Clicking 
the Emblems button reveals all the emblems you saw in Project 8B-1, thus pro-
viding you with another way to add them to your folders. This method is far 
handier when adding emblems to several folders or files in the same go.
To see how this works, click the Emblems button. Then drag the Camera 
emblem onto your Pictures folder and the People emblem onto your Public 
folder. The selected emblems will immediately appear on those folders, add-
ing to the growing proliferation of icons in the window.

Dressing Up he Bird
129
8B-3: Dolling Up the Side Pane (and Emblems Yet Again)
Now let’s change the look of the Nautilus side pane. Keeping the Backgrounds 
and Emblems window open (if you already closed it, open it again), click the 
Places menu button in the Nautilus side pane, and select Information.
You can add a different background pattern to the side pane now as well, 
but for practice let’s add a color instead. To do this, click the Colors button 
in the Backgrounds and Emblems window. The window will now be filled 
with swatches of color. Drag the Grapefruit swatch to your side pane, and it 
will turn from gray to, of all things, grapefruit (albeit a very dark and unusually 
colored grapefruit). You can also create a two-color gradation effect by adding 
yet another color. Drag the Mango swatch to the very bottom of the side pane 
(but still within the pane), and you should have a grapefruit-to-mango, top-
to-bottom gradation within the pane. Of course, if you are not pleased with 
this tropical color set, you can get back to your original default gray panel by 
dragging the Reset swatch onto the area. When you’re done, you can close 
the Backgrounds and Emblems window.
The side pane of your Nautilus window provides yet a third way to work 
with emblems. But before I let you in on this third (and last) way, let’s add 
another folder to your home folder. Create a folder and name it Finances, 
which you can use to store files dealing with your relative worth in the mod-
ern scheme of things.
After you’ve created the new folder, go to the side pane, click the 
Information drop-down menu, and select Emblems. A list of emblems will 
appear within the side pane. Select the Money emblem, and drag it onto your 
Finances folder. Next, select the Plan emblem, and drag it onto the Finances 
folder too. Add even more emblems to it if you like—you should be able to 
fit about four on there before Nautilus decides to end the madness and pre-
vent any more from being displayed. Your window should now look something 
like the one shown in Figure 8-5.
Once you are done, go back to the drop-down menu, and select Places to 
get everything back to relative normalcy again.
Even if it’s not your cup of tea, you have to admit that your Nautilus window 
is definitely more colorful now. You can, of course, change it to look however 
you want, but I’ll ask you to hold off on that a little while longer, because you 
are going to be doing some more playing around with it shortly.
8B-4: Changing the Desktop Background
Now that your home folder window is all gussied up (or gaudied up, depend-
ing on your aesthetic sense of things), you may think your desktop looks rather 
drab in comparison. 
You can easily change the desktop background (often called wallpaper) 
by right-clicking any open space on the desktop and selecting Change Desktop 
Background in the pop-up menu. This will open the Appearance Preferences 
window, opened to the Background tab (see Figure 8-6).

Installing Additional Wallpapers
As you can see if you hover your mouse over it, the default wallpaper in Ubuntu 
is called Ubuntu. If purple blobs aren’t your style, click any of the other wall-
papers to immediately change the wallpaper on the desktop. There are quite 
a few to choose from, but maybe you’d prefer to use some images of your 
own. These could be photos from a digital camera, works of art you created 
on your computer, or just about anything you want to put there. In this case, 
however, you are going to venture out onto the Web to get and then install 
some wallpaper.
A number of sites provide free desktop wallpaper—two sites specifically 
geared toward Linux users are http://www.gnome-look.org/ and http://art
.gnome.org/, but you can get wallpaper from wherever you like. Astronomy 
Picture of the Day (http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) is a particular favorite of mine. 
If you want to follow along using the same bigger-than-life-Tux wallpaper 
that I use here, however, go directly to the wallpaper image by pointing your 
web browser to http://www.taiabati.com/linux/OLDindex.php/, scrolling down 
the page a tad to the second TUX section, and then clicking the download but-
ton next to the image size that best matches your screen. When the picture 
appears in the browser window, right-click it, and then select Save Image As. In 
the Save Image window, give it an easy-to-remember name (wall_TUX-2_1024
x768.png may be exact, but it might prove a bit much to deal with after a 
while), or use the one I gave it, mightyTux.png, and click Save. If you prefer, 
you can download any wallpaper you like from wherever you like, as long as it is 
in a supported format, such as BMP, PNG, or JPEG. It’s all up to you.
Once you’ve downloaded your wallpaper, move it from your Downloads 
folder into your Pictures folder. You may want to create a Wallpapers subfolder 
to keep things better organized, but that’s up to you, too. After that, you can 
install the new image by going to the Background tab in the Appearance Pref-
erences window and clicking the Add button. In the Add Wallpaper window 
that then appears, navigate to your new wallpaper, click it once to highlight 
it, and then click Open. The wallpaper will then appear highlighted in the 
Appearance Preferences window and will soon thereafter appear on the desk-
top (Figure 8-7). Once it does, click Close to complete the process.
Wallpaper from Internet to Desktop—Quick and Easy
It’s also possible to almost automatically set an image from the Web as your 
desktop wallpaper by right-clicking that image within your web browser and 
then selecting Set As Desktop Background. A small window will then appear, 
in which you can preview what the download will look like onscreen (Figure 8-8). 
You can also adjust the position (tiled or centered, for example) and back-
ground color for your desktop in this window. Once you’re done making 
adjustments, click the Set Desktop Background button. The image will then 
appear on your desktop, while the image file will be saved to a download loca-
tion (your home folder, by default) with the title Firefox_wallpaper.png.

8B-5: Hiding the Bottom Panel
You may have noticed that you can barely see the panel at the bottom of the 
screen in Figure 8-7. This is because the panel obscured the bottom of the new 
wallpaper, which irritated me. I went to the Panel Properties window by right-
clicking some empty space in the bottom panel and selecting Properties in 
the pop-up menu. In the Panel Properties window, I clicked the Autohide 

Dressing Up he Bird
133
checkbox and then clicked Close. The autohide function works just like it 
does in Windows or Mac OS X—the panel stays out of view until you move 
your mouse into the general vicinity of where it should be. You can make the 
same change if you like, but that is an aesthetic matter that I will leave up to 
you. Ah, the sweet taste of artistic freedom.
8B-6: Downloading and Installing the Art Manager (GNOME Art)
Searching the Internet for wallpaper to install can in itself be a rather fun 
adventure, but sometimes it can also feel like quite a chore. Fortunately for 
you, me, and all involved in such things, there is an even easier way: the Art 
Manager. The Art Manager, also known as GNOME Art, is a handy application 
that searches the http://art.gnome.org/ site and downloads a list, with thumb-
nails, of all the wallpapers that are available there. It can also do this for the 
various window borders, controls, and icon theme sets that you can use in the 
following parts of this project. Using the thumbnail lists, you can easily down-
load and install whatever you want—all without ever placing a cursor in your 
web browser. Needless to say, the Art Manager is decidedly cool!
Unfortunately, the Art Manager is not installed by default. However, 
after having gone through Chapter 6, you know how easy it is to download 
and install applications like the Art Manager. All you have to do is run the 
Ubuntu Software Center, search for gnome-art, and then install the Art 
Manager.
You can then run the Art Manager by selecting SystemPreferences
Art Manager. The GNOME Art window will then appear with absolutely nothing 
in it. To put it to use and relieve that emptiness, select ArtBackgrounds
GNOME. (You can select All instead of GNOME if you like, but it will take 
longer to download the list of available wallpapers.)
Once you’ve made your selection, the Art Manager will begin download-
ing a list of all that is available for you at http://art.gnome.org/. It may seem 
like nothing is happening for a minute or so, but that is normal; just hang in 
there. It might take a few minutes to download previews of the backgrounds, 
but when it’s done, you will see a list of thumbnails for you to choose from 
(Figure 8-9).
You can now install wallpaper by scrolling down until you find one that 
suits your fancy, clicking it once to highlight it, and then clicking the Install 
button. The Art Manager will then download and install it. After that, open 
the Appearance Preferences window, and choose the wallpaper you just down-
loaded as your desktop wallpaper. As I said before, the Art Manager is a very 
handy tool to have, especially since you’ll be using it more soon within this 
project.

8B-7: Changing Window Borders, Controls, and Icon Sets 
Now we get to my favorite part of this journey through the world of digital 
cosmetic surgery—changing the way window borders and controls look in 
GNOME. The procedure is really quite easy. Select SystemPreferences
Appearance. The Appearance Preferences window will open to the Theme 
tab, showing you a list of the themes that are installed on your system (see 
Figure 8-10). The default theme in Lucid Lynx is called Ambiance, but, as you 
can see, there are several others.
To get the hang of things, take a look at each of the themes listed by click-
ing them one by one. The changes will take effect immediately. Just clicking 
a theme will change your window borders, controls, and even, if you take a 
peek in your home folder, the icons. This is especially noticeable when you 
click Dust Sand or New Wave.
Each theme consists of a window border, a set of controls, and a collection 
of icons. It’s also possible to mix and match these elements on your own. For 
example, let’s say that you like the subdued look and color of the controls in 
Dust, but you prefer the window icons in Clearlooks and the borders in Dark-
Room. Well, you needn’t despair, because you can create a custom theme 
consisting of these three different elements.
To create your own mix-and-match theme, just click the Customize button 
on the Theme tab of the Appearance Preferences window. A new window will 
open, in which you will find five tabs: Controls, Colors, Window Border, Icons, 
and Pointer (Figure 8-11). From within each of these tabs, you can select the 
components you prefer. For now, let’s first click the Controls tab and select 
Dust. Then click the Window Border tab, and select DarkRoom. Finally, click 
the Icons tab, and select GNOME.

136
Chapter 8
Now keep the Customize Theme window open, but open your home 
folder and take a look at what you’ve done. Hmm . . . not bad. But, perhaps 
you don’t really like the look of those DarkRoom window borders all that much. 
To find something that suits you better, click the Window Border tab again, 
go down the list, and click each entry until you see something you do like 
(New Wave seems to do the trick for me) and select that. Better? Now that 
you are satisfied, you can click the Close button.
You will now be back at the Appearance Preferences window, where you 
will notice your new theme listed with the name Custom. If you want to save 
this new combination for later use, click the Save As button. Doing so will 
open a dialog box in which you can name your theme and write a brief com-
ment about it. So, name your theme, write a comment if you like, and then 
click Save. Your new theme will now appear in alphabetical order within the 
theme list under the name you chose.
Once that’s all done, your home folder window should look like that in 
Figure 8-12 (and take a look at your panel and Applications menu while you’re 
at it). Ah, très cool!
Figure 8-12: Changing the look of your system windows
8B-8: Installing Additional Window Borders, Controls, and Icons
If you are excited about this customization thing but you’re not satisfied with 
the theme choices included with the system, you can download and install 
still other window borders, controls, and icons. To show you how to do this, I 
will walk you through creating a faux Mac theme, which will look fairly similar 
to the standard Aqua theme of Mac OS X, as you can see in Figure 8-13.

Figure 8-13: An “Aquafied” Ubuntu desktop
Getting and Installing the Files You’ll Need
To get the files you’ll need to do this, take the Art Manager for another ride. 
Once it is up and running, select ArtBackgroundsOther. Once the list of 
available wallpapers appears in the Art Manager window, scroll down until you 
find one called Real shoot, install it by clicking the Install button, and then 
select and apply it on the Background tab of the Appearance Preferences 
window.
NOTE
If the Art Manager does not automatically start downloading a list of available files 
when you make a selection from the Art menu, just restart the Art Manager and try 
again.
Next, get a set of matching application control widgets and window borders 
by selecting ArtDesktop ThemesApplication in the Art Manager. When 
the list is downloaded, look for a file called Yattacier 3, and install it. In the 
Appearance Preferences window that then appears, select Yattacier 3 in the 
list on the Theme tab.
To round things up, let’s add some new icons to the mix by returning to 
the Art Manager and selecting ArtDesktop ThemesIcon. Once the list 
has finished downloading, look for and install Snow-Apple. After that, it’s 
basically a repeat of the previous step, but this time around, click the Icons 
tab in the Customize Theme window, and then select Snow Apple.

138
Chapter 8
Finishing Touches
Well, things are certainly sort of Mac-ish now, but there is even more we can 
do to emphasize the effect. Open the Panel Properties window for your bottom 
panel by right-clicking a blank area of the panel and selecting Properties in 
the pop-up menu. In the General tab of that window, uncheck Expand, and 
then increase the size of the panel to about 54 pixels. When you’re done, 
click Close, and then start adding launchers for the applications you use most. 
You might also want to remove the Workspace Switcher and the Window List 
to complete the effect. Right-click the little dotted or ridged bit immediately to 
the left of where the names of currently open windows are displayed and 
choose Remove From Panel to get rid of the Window List, and right-click any 
of the set of four boxes on the bottom panel and choose Remove From Panel 
to remove the Workspace Switcher.
NOTE
If you’d like a more OS X–ish Dock, plenty are available; try Avant Window Navigator, 
Cairo Dock, or Docky, all of which are available via the Ubuntu Software Center. You 
must have Visual Effects turned on (that is, set to Normal or Extra) on the Visual 
Effects tab of the Appearance Preferences window in order to use these.
Once you’re done, go to the top menu, and remove the two icons next to 
the System menu. After that, add a Window Selector applet so that you have 
some way to navigate through your open windows. You might also want to 
change the background in your home folder, since the warm tones currently 
there no longer match your new cooler configuration.
The transformation is now complete, but you can also add trash can and 
computer icons to your desktop by going on to Project 8B-10, after which 
your desktop should look something like mine back in Figure 8-13. You can 
stick with your new OS X–ish theme or switch to something else. For consis-
tency’s sake, I will switch back to the default theme now. By the way, if you do 
decide to keep the faux Aqua theme, remember to click the Save As button 
in the Appearance Preferences window and give the theme a name.
8B-9: Changing the Order of the Window Buttons
If you’re used to Windows, you might be finding the order of the buttons at 
the tops of windows a little . . . weird. Instead of having your minimize, maxi-
mize, and close buttons at the top right of the window, Ubuntu puts them at 
the top left. I don’t mind this layout so much, but if you’re struggling with it, 
you’ll be glad to know it’s easy to change them to the right:
1.
Press ALT-F2 to open the Run Application window.
2.
Run the GNOME Configuration Editor by typing gconf-editor in that 
window and then pressing ENTER.
3.
When the Configuration Editor window appears, click the small + next to 
apps, scroll down to metacity, and click the + next to that.
4.
Click general in that expanded metacity section to display a set of options.

Dressing Up he Bird
139
5.
Scroll down to the button_layout option. It should be set to close,minimize,
maximize: at the moment—this gives the order of the buttons (for example, 
the maximize button is the third one along) and the side of the window 
that they appear on (for example, all three are on the left side of the 
colon, so the buttons will appear on the left of the window).
6.
To get the buttons into the familiar Windows order, click the value of the 
button_layout option to start editing it. Type :minimize,maximize,close in 
place of the old value.
7.
Press ENTER to finish editing, and the window buttons in all your win-
dows should switch sides immediately (as shown in Figure 8-14).
Figure 8-14: Putting the window buttons on the right side of the window
8B-10: Placing Home and Trash Icons on the Desktop
As you are already aware, unlike Windows, Mac OS X, or other Linux distri-
butions, Ubuntu has a completely empty desktop upon installation. A lot of 
people advocate this approach because it discourages the permanent use of 
the desktop as a location to store files and program launchers. After all, as the 
argument goes, you don’t place your trash can or file cabinet on the desktop 
in your office, do you?
All such logic aside, many people prefer to have their trash can, hard disk, 
and home folder on their desktops, thank you very much. If you are one of 
them, as I am, here’s what you need to do:
1.
Open the GNOME Configuration Editor, as you did in “Project 8B-9: 
Changing the Order of the Window Buttons” on page 138.
2.
Click the + next to apps, scroll down to nautilus, and click the + next to that.

140
Chapter 8
3.
Click desktop in the nautilus section, after which the options for that 
item will appear in the right pane of the window (Figure 8-15).
Figure 8-15: Adding icons to the desktop with the Configuration Editor
4.
Check the boxes next to the items you would like to appear on 
the desktop. You have four unchecked choices to choose from: 
computer_icon_visible, which is like the (My) Computer folder in 
Windows; home_icon_visible, which is for quick access to your home 
folder; network_icon_visible, which is to create a link to your Network 
folder, if you use it; and trash_icon_visible, which is for you-know-what. 
5.
Check any that look useful, and when you’re done, close the Configura-
tion Editor.
8B-11: Stretching Desktop Icons
A pretty cool feature in the GNOME desktop is stretchable icons. This allows 
you to make individual desktop icons any size you want, which can be not 
only aesthetically pleasing but also quite functional. For example, you could 
stretch one of your most commonly used launchers to make it easy to locate, 
or you could stretch the thumbnail of a photo file so that it appears as desk-
top art (see Figure 8-16).
To stretch a desktop icon, right-click the icon, and select Stretch icon in 
the pop-up menu. Four blue squares will appear at each of the corners sur-
rounding the icon (as shown in Figure 8-17). Just click and drag any of those 
squares until the icon is the size you want. Once you are done stretching, click 
anywhere on the desktop, and the squares will disappear. If you have second 
thoughts and want to revert the icon to its original size, right-click it, and 
choose Restore Icon’s Original Size from the menu.

8B-12: Doing It All Again!
Now that you’re equipped with the necessary know-how to customize just 
about everything, it’s time to say goodbye to graphika and start work on your 
own user account. Click the power button at the top right of the screen, select 
Log Out, and then click the Log Out button to get back to the login screen. 
Now, log in to your usual user account and begin the task of imposing your 
sense of style on the place. . . .
Font Feathered Frenzy: Changing Your Fonts
By now Ubuntu should be starting to feel a little more you; you’ve got your 
favorite desktop wallpaper, chosen the most appealing window borders, and 
added icons galore . . . so what else is there to tweak? Why, your fonts, of course! 
Most of the time you look at your computer screen will be spent reading, so 
it’s only logical to want to spruce up the text too. To get started doing this, 
select SystemPreferencesAppearance, which will open the Appearance 
Preferences window again. Click the Fonts tab in that window to see the options 
available to you (Figure 8-18).

142
Chapter 8
Figure 8-18: The Fonts tab
As you can see, you can specify font preferences in five categories: appli-
cations, documents, desktop, window titles, and the Terminal (fixed width 
font). To change any of these, just click the corresponding font button, and 
a Pick a Font window will appear. This lets you choose the font family, style, 
and size, and it will preview your current selection at the bottom of the 
window.
Once you click OK, the choices you make take effect immediately, so you 
will soon know whether you can live with them. Unlike the other aspects of 
customization, those choices could drive you stark raving mad. Sure, it is easy 
and fun to live with the gaudiest desktop imaginable, the wildest and most 
mismatched color scheme on the planet, and the goofiest icons ever to be seen 
by post-Neanderthal man, but if your font selections get too out of hand, 
watch out! You do have to be able to read the results, after all.
The fonts you see on your screen generally look quite smooth and clean. 
If you are using an LCD monitor, however, you may find that fonts will look 
even better if you select Subpixel smoothing (LCDs) in the Rendering section 
of the Font tab in the Appearance Preferences window. If you’re not sure 
whether you need to do this, just give it a try to see whether you notice any 
difference. GNOME applies the changes immediately upon selection, so if 
you keep a window with text in it open behind the preferences window, you 
can easily see the effect of each of your selections as you make them.

Your Ubuntu system comes with a wide variety of very usable and, at least to 
my eyes, rather handsome TrueType fonts. However, these tend to be a bit 
on the conservative side of the aesthetic spectrum, and many users will want 
to add a few more distinctive fonts to the system repertoire. In my own case, 
I had this really cool idea of writing messages to my friend in old Scandina-
vian runes. (Of course, my friend wet-blanketed the idea, so it all came to 
naught. . . .)
You probably won’t be interested in sending cryptic, runic messages to 
your friends, but you may want to print an award for an event using some sort 
of Gothic font, or you might be preparing a newsletter for the local chapter of 
your snail-breeders society and want to use a font that is round, bubbly, and 
slimy. Whatever your penchant, purpose, or desire, you will probably come to 
the point when you want to install some other TrueType fonts on your system, 
so in this project I’ll tell you how to do just that.
How you install fonts depends on who is going to use them. If you have 
only one user account on your machine, the easiest way is to install the fonts 
locally, as described in “Project 8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally” on page 144. 
Locally installed fonts are ones that only you or someone logged in to your 
user account will be able to use. On the other hand, if you have more than 
one user account and want the fonts to be available to all the users on your 
machine, you’ll need to install them globally—in this case, see “Project 8C-3: 
Installing TrueType Fonts Globally” on page 145.
8C-1: Getting the Font Files
The Internet is awash in free fonts. For this project, I will point you to the 
http://www.fontfreak.com/ site, which has a very nice collection of fonts. Once 
you get to the FontFreak home page, click the Fonts link under the “FREE 
FONTS” heading on the left side of the page. The next page will ask you 
whether you want to download all the free fonts on the site in one single file; 
click No thanks, I will download them one by one. This will lead you to the 
main list of free fonts; browse through the various pages until you find one 
that is to your liking, and then click it. Which font you download is completely 
up to you, but be sure to choose the PC version, not the Mac version. You can 
do this by clicking the Windows icon at the bottom of the font page (next to 
where it says Download). When the download window pops up, choose Save 
File and click OK to save the font as a .zip file. To follow along with this project, 
download a couple of fonts—I chose Aajax Surreal Freak and Accidental 
Presidency.
When you’ve finished downloading, drag the font files from the Downloads 
folder (or wherever you saved them) to your home folder so it’s easy to fol-
low along with my instructions. Also, be sure to unzip your font files before 
going on to the installation steps. (Right-click each .zip file, and choose Extract 
Here.)

Chapter 8
8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally
If you’re the sole user of your computer, installing fonts locally will do just 
fine. To get started, you need to set up your system by providing it with a 
location to place your fonts. You will need to do this only the very first time. 
Here’s what you must do:
1.
Open your home folder, and, in that window, create an invisible fonts 
folder by selecting FileCreate Folder.
2.
When the folder appears, name it .fonts (the period before the name 
means that it will be hidden).
3.
Hide the new folder by clicking the Reload button. Your .fonts folder 
should no longer be visible. If this is the case, you can close the window—
your setup was successful.
Now that everything is set up, let’s continue with this project using one 
of the fonts you downloaded. After you’ve decided which font to use, follow 
these steps:
4.
Choose the unzipped font file (its name probably ends in .ttf ), and copy 
it by right-clicking and selecting Copy.
5.
Press CTRL-L, or select GoLocation. This will display the location bar in 
Nautilus.
6.
In the location bar, type ~/.fonts, and press ENTER. The ~ sign is a short-
cut that means “my home folder.”
7.
You should be taken to the empty .fonts folder you just created, like the 
one in Figure 8-19. Right-click anywhere in the folder, and select Paste to 
copy the font into the folder.
Now that you have installed your font, you can give it a try in one of your 
applications, such as OpenOffice.org Writer. (Any running applications 
need to be restarted before the new font will appear in that application’s font 
menu.)

8C-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally
As I mentioned earlier, the font you just installed locally can be used only 
when you log in under your usual username. If, however, you want to install 
fonts that can be used by you and anyone else who has an account on your 
computer, the process is slightly different and will require a little “superuser” 
action. You can use the other font you downloaded for this part of the project.
The folder for globally installed fonts is in root territory, so you will need 
to open the file browser as superuser in order to install the fonts. Superuser is 
another name for the root (administrative) user. It’s possible to run a program 
as root without switching to a different user account by using a system called 
sudo (more on this in Chapter 9), but since root can modify important system 
files, you shouldn’t run a program in sudo mode unless you absolutely must.
Here are the steps for getting your font file into the global font directory:
1.
Press ALT-F2, and then type gksudo nautilus /usr/share/fonts/truetype into 
the box that appears. Click Run, and type your password if prompted.
2.
A File Browser window will open. Select FileCreate Folder to create a 
new folder; call it MyFonts.
3.
Open a normal File Browser (Nautilis) window by selecting Places
Home, find the .ttf font file you want to install, and copy it (for example, 
by right-clicking it and selecting Copy).
4.
Switch back to the truetype File Browser window, open your newly created 
MyFonts folder, and paste the font file into it.
5.
Be sure to close the superuser File Browser window—leaving it open is a 
recipe for disaster!
NOTE
The gksudo command in Step 1 is the graphical environment version of the non-graphical 
sudo command that you will learn to use via the command Terminal in Chapter 9.
Now you can test things by opening OpenOffice.org and looking for the 
font in the font menu. Remember that you will need to restart OpenOffice.org 
if it was already open when you installed the font.
There’s always a holdout. You may have gotten your desktop and windows 
looking just the way you like, but the screen that’s displayed when you log in 
hasn’t changed one bit—it’s still the same old default theme, with the same 
old default background. It’s time to give it a makeover.
The login screen, also known as the greeter, is shown to everyone who has 
a user account on your computer, so you might want to check with others before 
making some of the following cosmetic changes. If you’re the only person 
who uses the computer, then ask yourself for permission and carry on.
Project 8D: Changing Your Login Screen

146
Chapter 8
8D-1: Beautifying the Login Screen
The software that displays the login screen is called GDM, and it has its own 
hidden user account on your computer. This might seem a little strange, but 
this is the way lots of Linux programs do things when they are shared between 
several users. What you need to do now is log in to this hidden user account 
and change the settings for GDM. Fortunately, it’s a pretty straightforward 
process and doesn’t even require you to log out of your own account:
1.
Press ALT-F2 to open the Run Application window.
2.
Type gksu -u gdm dbus-launch gnome-appearance-properties into the box, as 
shown in Figure 8-20.
Figure 8-20: Typing the command into the Run Application 
window
3.
Click Run. You’ll be asked for your password, so type it, and click OK.
NOTE
Some extra icons might appear on your panel when you perform this step. Don’t worry, 
they’re harmless and will disappear when you log out and log back in again.
4.
The Appearance Preferences window should appear. This Appearance 
Preferences window works the same way as the one you used earlier in 
this chapter.
5.
Use the Background tab to change the wallpaper that appears behind 
the login screen and the Theme tab to change how the login window 
looks.
6.
When you’re happy with your changes, click Close, and log out of your 
user account to get back to the login screen and inspect your changes.
Take a look at Figure 8-21 to see what you can do. I changed the back-
ground to a delicious-looking picture of cherries and the login window to the 
browny-orange Human theme, for a slightly more rural feel.

8D-2: Adding a Picture to Your User Account
Aesthetics aside, it’s time to make things a little more personal. What better 
way to do this than by adding a picture to your user account? Select System
PreferencesAbout Me, and when the window appears (Figure 8-22), click 
the button that looks like a blank face. The Select Image window will appear—
choose one of the stock images from the list, or use the pane on the left of 
the screen to find a picture from elsewhere (a passport photo, perhaps). Now, 
click Open to finalize your selection, and the picture will appear next to your 
username in the About Me window.
While you’re there, fill out some of the other information if you like. It’s 
not used for very much, but as anyone who has ever possessed a permanent 
marker knows, it can be fun to stamp your identity all over your things. When 
you’re finished, close the About Me window. The picture you chose will be 
displayed next to your username on the login screen the next time you start 
the computer (as you can see in Figure 8-21).

8D-3: Logging In Automatically
While you’re tinkering with the login screen, it seems like a good idea to 
mention some of the other login-related options that you can change. Log in 
to your user account again, and select SystemAdministrationLogin Screen. 
Click the Unlock button, and type your password to gain access to the settings 
in the Login Screen Settings window that appears.
If you’re the only person who uses the computer, you can save time by 
having your user account automatically log in when the machine starts up. 
Select the Log in as option, and choose your username from the drop-down 
list (it should be selected automatically). If you’re not the only user but you’re 
the person who uses the computer for most of the time, there’s also a setting 
to give other people a chance to log in before you’re logged in automatically. 
Check Allow 30 seconds for anyone else to log in first, and change the amount 
of time you’d like GDM to wait before logging you in.
The last option in this window (the one talking about default sessions) can 
be used to switch between different desktop environments. As you know, Ubuntu 
uses the GNOME desktop by default, but you can install others like KDE and 
Xfce instead. That’s a bit of a teaser for you would-be geeks out there—if you 
want to perform the ultimate customization and change the whole desktop 
environment, this is one of the settings you’re going to need to change. Chang-
ing desktops is beyond the scope of this book, though, so I’m just going to leave 
it there! (If you’re interested in trying a different desktop environment, you 
might find https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FromUbuntuToKubuntu/ useful.)
NOTE
If you’re not keen on the sound that plays every time you log in, uncheck the Play log-in 
sound option in the Login Screen window.

When you’re happy with your changes, close the Login Screen Settings 
window, and restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Then, 
depending on which option you chose, either you’ll be logged in straight-
away or an Automatic Login button will appear and count down the seconds 
until it logs you in. In the latter case, you can stop the automatic login by 
selecting a different username.
Choosing a Screensaver
Screensavers used to be a must-have (and must-use) item for computer users 
who wanted to prevent damage (burn-in) to their monitors. Video display 
technology, however, has now advanced to the point where screensavers are 
no longer necessary. Nevertheless, screensavers are cool to look at, and 
plenty are available online to supplement the 15 that come installed by 
default. Right out of the box, the screensaver is set up to merely blank 
your screen after 5 minutes. However, you can also choose to have the 
various screensavers switch randomly every few minutes, or you can opt 
for a single screensaver that you especially like. You can change these set-
tings by selecting SystemPreferencesScreensaver, after which the 
Screensaver Preferences window (Figure 8-23) will appear.
NOTE
If you’d prefer a screensaver with a more personal touch, choose the Pictures folder 
option from the list on the left of the window. This will display a slide show of all the 
photos in your Pictures folder when the screensaver is activated.

Taking Screenshots
Now that you know how to make your Ubuntu desktop look a bit more like 
your own, you might want to share or record the results of your artistic endeav-
ors, and taking screenshots is the way to do just that. The easiest way to go 
about this is by selecting ApplicationsAccessoriesTake Screenshot.
The Screenshot application, shown in Figure 8-24, will appear. In this win-
dow you can decide whether you want to take an image of the whole screen, a 
section of the screen, or a selected window. You can also apply a delay before 
the screenshot is taken to give yourself some wiggle time. You can even add 
effects to your window shots, such as a drop shadow.
Figure 8-24: Taking a screenshot in Ubuntu
When you’re ready, click Take Screenshot, and a window like the one in 
Figure 8-25 will appear. In that window, you can name the image and decide 
where to save it.
Figure 8-25: Saving a screenshot in Ubuntu
If you prefer, it is also possible to take screenshots via key combinations. 
To take a shot of the entire screen, just press the PRINT SCREEN key. To take a 
shot of a single window, press ALT-PRINT SCREEN.
If you try taking screenshots of single window, you may find that the win-
dow borders refuse to appear no matter what you do. This is not a problem 
with the screenshot mechanism but rather a side effect of your system’s visual 
effects engine, Compiz, which I’ll talk about more in the next section. One 

Dressing Up he Bird
151
solution is to use the GIMP for your screenshot-taking chores (discussed in 
Chapter 13). Alternatively, you can just shut off Compiz: Select System
PreferencesAppearance, and click the Visual Effects tab in the Appearance 
Preferences window that appears. Once on that tab, select None (Figure 8-26); 
the change should take place almost immediately, and once it does, you can 
close the Appearance Preferences window and try taking your screenshot again.
Figure 8-26: Shutting off Compiz using the Visual Effects tab
Customizing Visual Effects
Having learned how to customize your system using the more traditional 
tools at your disposal, it’s time to let loose and have some fun with some of 
the newest customization tools the Linux world has to offer. Compiz, Ubuntu’s 
visual effects engine, provides all sorts of wild and interesting visual effects 
for your desktop.
Compiz will be automatically enabled at startup only if you have a graphics 
card that supports its basic set of features. An easy way to tell whether Compiz 
has kicked in on your machine is to open any window (your home folder, for 
example) and then check to see whether that window has a drop shadow (see 
Figure 8-27 for an example). If it does, Compiz is at work.

152
Chapter 8
Figure 8-27: The window on the left has a drop shadow; the one on the right does not.
The effects that are active by default are really the tip of the iceberg. 
Depending on the capabilities of your graphics card, you will get the drop 
shadows and a few other bells and whistles, such as cooler window-opening 
transitions, but that’s about it . . . on the surface, at any rate. If you like, you can 
kick the effects up a notch by selecting SystemPreferencesAppearance, 
clicking the Visual Effects tab of the Preferences window, and finally selecting 
Extra in that tab.
I should warn you not to be freaked out at first when you try to move 
your windows and they start wiggling like jelly—that’s one of the additional 
effects (Wobbly Windows).
Whatever the hardware capabilities of your system, if you really want to 
take control of all that Compiz has to offer, it is worth your while to install 
the CompizConfig Settings Manager (Figure 8-28), which you can get via the 
Ubuntu Software Center (search for Advanced Desktop Effects Settings and install 
it). Once it’s installed, you can run it by selecting SystemPreferences
CompizConfig Settings Manager.
Once the CompizConfig Settings Manager is installed, you can see every-
thing Compiz is capable of doing, and you can pick and choose from those 
features as you see fit. Although most of what Compiz has to offer is essentially 
eye-candy (which is what this chapter is all about, after all), there are some 
functional utilities and extras. A favorite of mine is the Annotate tool, which 
allows you to write all over your screen while making presentations, brain-
storming, or just flipping out (shown in Figure 8-29).
To activate the Annotate tool—or any other Compiz feature—open the 
CompizConfig Settings Manager, and check the box next to its name. To 
figure out how to actually use what you’ve enabled, click the name of the 
feature. This will open a tab showing its settings, including the keystrokes 
needed to initiate that feature (Figure 8-30).

Some of the keys used for the default Compiz shortcuts may seem unfamiliar; of these, 
the most commonly used ones are the Super key (typically the Windows key on your key-
board) and Button1 (usually your left mouse button).

You can also edit the various key-

your new choices in the Edit window 
that appears (Figure 8-31). When 
you’re done with the settings for an 
individual feature, click the Back but-
ton in the lower-left corner of the 
CompizConfig Settings Manager win-
dow to go back to the main screen.

Getting to Know the Linux Terminal and Command Line . . . and the Cool 
Things It Can Do
Many people shy away from Linux because 
they envision it as a system for compu-geeks, 
an environment in which you do everything 
the hard way—by command line. In this era of graphi-
cal interfaces, the idea of typing commands to get 
things done seems like a dreadful throwback to the 
days of DOS, and that puts many people off, especially 
those who remember what it was like in the “old days.”
This reaction is fair enough, but it is not really an accurate reflection of 
the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some 
sort of graphical interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they 
hope to achieve through drop-down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many 
are able to survive quite happily without ever once opening their Terminal. 
The same could be true of you.

156
Chapter 9
Be that as it may, there is still much to be said for the power and conve-
nience of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be 
utilized within a graphical environment also makes it much less forbidding. 
The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of graphical bodies 
(see Figure 9-1). Using the command line can be as pain-free as anything 
else you do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a little fun if 
you are willing to give it a try.
Figure 9-1: Putting the Terminal in perspective
Unfortunately, many guides to using the command line are written by 
hard-core command-line junkies, whose enthusiasm for what they see as a 
really good thing inadvertently makes what they write seem even more off-
putting to the recent Linux immigrant or wanna-be.
For your sake, I will try to curb my own enthusiasm so as not to scare you 
right back to Chapter 6 and the more comfortable world of the Ubuntu Soft-
ware Center. I will also try to help you keep things in perspective by teaching 
you, whenever possible, to use the command line as a complement to the var-
ious graphical tools that you have at your disposal, rather than presenting it 
as the sole way of going about things. Of course, I am not going to cover every 
possible angle in this regard—just enough to give you some exposure and 
experience and, ideally, make you feel at least a little more at ease with the com-
mand line. Who knows; could you actually come to think of using the command 
line as . . . fun? Well, I won’t get too carried away.
Meet the Terminal
You can run the Linux command-line Terminal application in your Ubuntu 
system by selecting ApplicationsAccessoriesTerminal. When the Terminal 
opens, it will, in all its simplicity, look much like Figure 9-2.

Simple Kitten Ways
157
Figure 9-2: The Terminal application
As you can see, all it says is rg@rg-desktop:~$. In this case, rg is my user-
name, rg-desktop is the name I gave my computer during installation, and 
the tilde (~) signifies that I am in my home folder. If it were to say ~/Music, 
for example, it would mean that I am currently in the Music folder within my 
home folder. Of course, all this will be different in your case, because your 
username and computer name will be different. If your username is frog 
and your computer’s name is wetrock, for example, the command line will 
say frog@wetrock:~$. If all this is sounding rather obtuse to you, just think of it 
this way: username@computer_name:~$ in the Terminal is the equivalent of your 
home folder in Nautilus.
Typing in the Terminal is straightforward enough; you just type as you 
usually do. You can also delete and insert letters or phrases by using the DELETE 
and BACKSPACE keys and the arrow keys. For practice, try the following:
1.
Type I like strawberries so very much.
2.
Change strawberries to cherries (because cherries are, in fact, so much 
better). Just use your left arrow key to move the cursor in front of the 
first s in strawberries. 
3.
Tap your DELETE key as many times as necessary to erase the word straw-
berries (uh, that would be 12 times, methinks).
4.
Type cherries, and then use your right arrow key to move the cursor back 
to the end of this meaningful sentence.
Now that you’ve completed this fascinating bit of typing practice, press 
the ENTER key. As you will almost immediately see, the Terminal’s response 
to your efforts thus far is merely a dismissive I: command not found. Although 
you’ve typed a string of text that has meaning to you, it means absolutely 
nothing to your system. In fact, the system was so shortsighted that it could 
see nothing other than the first word you typed in the Terminal (I); and 
because I is not a valid command, the system had no idea what do to with it.

158
Chapter 9
Some Goofy Yet Useful Fun with the Command Terminal
A rather cool thing about typing in the command Terminal is that it has what 
you might call short-term memory. Try it by typing the word cherry and then 
pressing ENTER. Ignoring the command-not-found message, go on and type 
vanilla, and press ENTER. Now type gelato, and press ENTER. So far, so dumb, 
right? Well, not really. Let’s type everything we’ve typed thus far again, but 
this time let’s do it with only one key. 
Huh?
Yes, just press the up arrow key once, and what do you see? That’s right—
the last command you typed appears, which in this case would be gelato. 
Press the up arrow key again, and the command that you typed before that 
will appear—vanilla. One more time? Yes, cherry. And one more time for the 
grand finale . . . I like cherries so very much. 
Considering what we have thus far, this may all seem a bit silly, but imag-
ine that you’re not typing goofy little words and instead have to deal with 
considerably longer strings, such as a simple copy command (which you’ll 
learn about later in this chapter) like this:
cp Photos/mypics/stpierre/coastal/onthebeach1_27.jpg /home/frog/
photos_for_mom/stpierre
By typing that string, you are copying an image called onthebeach1_27.jpg 
from the coastal folder to another folder called stpierre. If you wanted to copy 
another photo in the coastal folder, onthebeach1_16.jpg, for instance, you could 
simply press the up arrow key once, use the left arrow key and DELETE key to 
move over to and delete the 27, and replace it with 16. All in all, it would be 
much simpler and much faster. It would also help you avoid mistakes in typing. 
Not so dumb anymore, eh?
Nontoxic Commands
As you now know, all of this typing is easy enough, but to actually do some-
thing useful with your Terminal, you need to type commands—and there are 
more of them than you could ever hope or need to know. To get you started, 
we will begin with some commands that are easy to understand, nontoxic, 
and completely kitten-friendly.
$ whoami
There is no command as easy, safe, or even as seemingly useless as whoami. 
Rather than help those with multiple-personality disorders discover who they 
are at any given moment, the whoami command simply tells you which user is 
currently logged in. Try it by typing whoami after the $ and then pressing the 
ENTER key. Remember that commands are case sensitive.

Simple Kitten Ways
159
The Terminal will now tell you the username of the person currently 
logged in. If you are logged in as frog, you should get frog as the answer to 
your command.
$ finger
If you enjoyed discovering who you are with the whoami command, then you 
might enjoy finding out even more about yourself using the finger command. 
You can use the finger command in a number of ways, but a very simple one 
is finding out about a particular user. Try this on yourself by typing finger 
and then your username. In my case, that would be finger rg. Once you’ve 
typed the command, press ENTER, and see what you get. You can see my 
results in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3: Output from the finger command
As you can see, my login name is rg, my real name is Rickford Grant, my 
home directory is /home/rg, and I am using the Bash shell for typing my com-
mands. I have been logged on since Wednesday, April 14, at 19:59 Eastern 
daylight time (EDT), and I’ve had my Terminal session open since Thursday, 
April 15, at 19:26. I have no mail or plan. It doesn’t tell you my Social Security 
number or my mother’s maiden name, but it is pretty cool, don’t you think?
What Is a Shell?
As you noticed, I mentioned that the results of the finger command showed I 
was using the Bash shell, so you may be understandably wondering just what 
Bash is. Well, Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the many shells that are 
used in Linux systems, and it’s the one that happens to come with your 
Ubuntu distro (and most others, for that matter). A shell is a program that 
interprets the commands you type into the Terminal and delivers them, so to 
speak, to your system so that it can act upon them. I like to think of it as a 
command-handling subsystem, for which the Terminal acts as a graphical 
frontend.

160
Chapter 9
What Is a Plan?
I also mentioned that the results said I had no plan, so you may also be 
wondering what that is all about. A .plan file is a small file kept in your home 
folder that other users see when they use the finger command on you. Tradi-
tionally, a .plan file contained information about where you were going to be 
or what you were working on. These days, however, most people use them to 
leave odd little messages, quotations, or whatever, much as they do in email 
signatures. Take a look at Figure 9-4 to see what happens after I add a .plan 
file to my home folder. 
Figure 9-4: Output from the finger command with a plan
You can now see my plan, which is a quotation from Kurt Vonnegut’s 
The Sirens of Titan (or Al Stewart’s song by the same name, for that matter), 
though you can put anything you want in your own. You will get the chance 
to create your own plan file in Project 9A, so if this all seems fun to you, just 
hang in there.
Before moving on, I should mention that you can also use the finger 
command to do a little domestic espionage of sorts. Let’s say your child, Chris, 
has a user account on your machine. Chris, who wants your permission to go 
to the movies, claims to have been hard at work on the computer all day 
writing a report for school. Having your doubts, you could type finger chris 
to see what the facts actually are. It may be a bit underhanded and rotten, but 
it works. It also works both ways; others can check up on you as well. You can 
try it by seeing when the last time you logged in to your graphika account was 
(assuming you created such an account in Chapter 8). Just type finger graphika, 
and then press ENTER.
You can even use the finger command to find out facts about people on 
other systems, providing their network’s finger service is active and you know 
their email address. Typing something like finger username@hostname.com 
would do the trick. It’s kind of cool but also kind of spooky, I suppose.

$ pwd
If you know who you are but aren’t exactly sure where you are, pwd (print 
working directory) should come in handy. The pwd command tells you 
exactly where the Terminal is in your directory tree. 
Let’s say, for example, that my Terminal is in my personal home directory 
(which is actually called rg) in the system’s home directory (which is actually 
called home and which is where all the user account directories are located) 
when I use the pwd command; I would, after pressing the ENTER key, get /
home/rg printed to my Terminal. You should get similar results if you try it.
NOTE
The word print, in this case, has nothing to do with your printer; it merely means that 
the response will be printed to, or displayed in, the Terminal.
$ df
Another safe and easy, but much more useful, command is df (disk filesystem). 
The df command tells you how much disk space you have used, as well as how 
much space you still have available, on each of the partitions on your various 
mounted disks. Try it by typing df and then pressing ENTER. Your output 
should look something like that shown in Figure 9-5 (depending, of course, 
on the size of your mounted disks and how they are set up).
Figure 9-5: Output from the df command 
As you will notice, the sizes are given in kilobytes (KB) rather than the 
gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB) you are probably more used to, but 
there is a way around this. Many commands accept a flag, or option, to further 
fine-tune how the command performs. These flags are written directly after 
the main command and are preceded by a space and a hyphen. 
In this case, you can try using the -h (human readable) flag to have your 
figures come out in the way you are most familiar with. Try this by typing df -h 
on the command line and pressing ENTER. The output should now appear in 
a more familiar format (see Figure 9-6).

162
Chapter 9
Figure 9-6: Output from the df command with the -h flag
$ ls
Another harmless but handy command is ls (list directory contents). The ls 
command shows you what is in your current directory. This is the nongraphical 
equivalent of double-clicking a folder in Nautilus to see what is inside. Try it 
by typing ls and then pressing the ENTER key. 
If you’ve been following my commands so far, your results should list all 
of the folders in your home directory. You can also use the -R flag to show not 
only the list of files in the folder but also what is within the subfolders. Of 
course, you should have no subfolders in any of the folders you created in 
Chapters 7 and 8, so you can hold off experimenting with this for a while. 
Instead, try typing ls -a to see your invisible, or hidden, files.
$ calendar
I’ll let you experiment with this one on your own. Just type calendar, and 
press ENTER to see the somewhat interesting results.
$ exit
The exit command is a simple one that allows you to exit the Terminal. Just 
type exit, and press ENTER. The Terminal window will close.
Commands with Some Teeth
The simple commands you have tried so far are all of the safe-and-sane, fire 
marshal–approved variety; they merely print information to your Terminal. 
Now you are going to try to get some real tangible results from the commands 
you use. These commands are also essentially safe and sane if you follow my 
instructions.

Simple Kitten Ways
163
$ mkdir
You have already learned how to create folders by means of menus and your 
mouse, but you can also do this using the command line. The command is 
mkdir (make directory), and it is easy as pie to use (though I’ve never been 
quite sure how pie is easy).
To see how this command works and to work with the commands that 
follow, use the mkdir command now to create a folder called command_exp 
(for command experiments). All you have to do is type mkdir command_exp in 
a new Terminal window and press ENTER. The new folder should appear in 
your home folder, so go ahead and check to see whether it is there by click-
ing the home icon on your desktop.
OK, good, bra, bueno! Now let’s create another new folder within that 
new folder—a subfolder, if you will. We’ll call this one sub. So, just type mkdir 
command_exp/sub, and press ENTER. You can now take a peek and see whether 
the sub folder appears within the command_exp folder, if you like.
$ mv
The next command is the mv (move) command, but before you experiment 
with it, you need to create a dummy file—you need something to move, after 
all. You can do this by using another command—touch. To make the file—
let’s call it expfile.txt—go to the Terminal, type touch expfile.txt, and press 
ENTER. The new file will now appear in your home folder.
To move the file that you’ve just created, you will use the mv command, of 
course. Just type mv expfile.txt command_exp/sub (this tells the system which file 
to move and where to move it to), and press ENTER. The file will now be in 
your sub folder.
$ cd
Until now, you have been using the command line from your home folder. 
With the cd command, you can change your Terminal’s location to another 
folder. This is a very handy command that you will be using quite a lot when 
doing the projects in this book. To take it out for a spin, let’s get inside the 
command_exp folder by typing cd command_exp and pressing ENTER. If you’ve 
done this correctly, the prompt in your Terminal should now read username@
computer_name:~/command_exp$. If so, you can pat yourself on the back.
While you are there, you might as well try the ls command with the R 
(recursive) flag to see how that works. Just type ls -R, and press ENTER. Your 
Terminal should now show that you have a subfolder there called sub and a 
file inside that subfolder called expfile.txt. 
That is all you really want to do in there for now, so to get back to your 
home directory, just type cd and press ENTER, which will take you back home, 
so to speak.

164
Chapter 9
For future reference, it is worth noting a couple of other cd command 
shortcuts. If you are within a subfolder of a subfolder and want to move back 
a step (from /home/rg/peas/pudding to /home/rg/peas, for example), you can 
do so by typing cd .. (with a space between cd and ..) and pressing ENTER. 
You can also type cd - (with a space between cd and -) in order to get back to 
a directory where you were previously (from /home/rg to /home/rg/peas/pudding, 
for example).
$ cp
Being fickle, as humans are by nature, you might decide that not only do you 
want your expfile.txt file in the subfolder but that you also want a copy in your 
home directory, where it was in the first place. To copy expfile.txt, you can use 
the cp (copy) command.
To do this, the command needs to know where the file you want to copy 
is, what it is called, and where you want to copy it, which in this case is to your 
home folder. Normally you would type cp command_exp/sub/expfile.txt /home/
username to do this, but if you recall my mention of it near the beginning of 
this chapter, you can abbreviate the /home/username portion of the command 
string to ~/, which means the same thing and is an important tip to remember, 
because the tilde is frequently used in online instructions. Because reducing 
wear and tear on the fingers is always a desirable goal, type the following 
command, and then press ENTER:
cp command_exp/sub/expfile.txt ~/ 
Be sure to put a space between the file you are copying and its destina-
tion (in this case, between expfile.txt and ~/). 
Once you’ve done this, you should have two copies of expfile.txt, one in 
your home folder and one in your sub folder. Go take a look to see the fruit 
of your endeavors.
$ rm
When you were a kid, you may well have experienced the joy of building a 
castle out of LEGO bricks and then the even greater joy of tearing the whole 
thing down (preferably by hurling D cell batteries at it). You will now embark 
on a similar move. The first tool in this nostalgic endeavor is the rm (remove) 
command, with which you can trash files.
The rm command, albeit very useful and easy to use, should be used with 
caution. Once you remove a file with this command, there is no going back—
the file will not be placed in the Trash; it is gone for good. 
To play it safe, let’s try the rm command by getting rid of that new copy 
of expfile.txt that we just created in the home folder. The basic rm command 
structure consists of the command itself, rm, followed by the name of the file 
you want to remove. In this case, you want to remove the file called expfile.txt 
located in your home folder. Assuming your Terminal shows you to be home, 

Simple Kitten Ways
165
remove the file by typing rm expfile.txt followed by a tap on the ol’ ENTER 
key. The file will then be gone, and gone for good.
Now, double your pleasure by getting rid of the version of expfile.txt that is 
located in the subfolder sub. In this case, you need to specify where the file is 
because it isn’t in the folder that the Terminal is in. Just type rm command_exp/
sub/expfile.txt, and then press ENTER. Oooh, very cool. Brings ya back, 
doesn’t it?
$ rmdir
You will now continue the fun with the rmdir (remove directory) command, 
which is a bigger and more powerful version of the rm command.
You should use the rmdir command, like the rm command, with caution. 
There are no do-overs with rmdir. Once you remove a directory or folder with 
this command, it is gone for good.
To try this command, you can get rid of that sub folder you created. Type 
rmdir command_exp/sub, and press ENTER. The sub folder should now be gone. 
Finally, to round out the fun, use the rmdir command once more to get rid of 
the command_exp folder you created earlier. You’ve probably got it down by 
now, but just in case you don’t, type rmdir command_exp, and then press ENTER. 
$ chmod
In Chapter 7, you learned how to change file permissions via the Nautilus 
interface. This is without a doubt the easiest way to go about such things, but 
you might find times when it is easier to use the command-line approach. 
The command for changing file permissions is chmod (change mode). To 
use it, just type the command followed by the permissions you want to extend 
to a file and then the location of the file itself. For example, let’s say you cop-
ied a JPEG file, mybirthday.jpg, from a CD to the personal subfolder within the 
Photos folder on your hard disk, and the file is write protected. To change the 
file so that you have write permissions (meaning that you can alter the file), 
you would type the following and then press ENTER: 
chmod 744 ~/photos/personal/mybirthday.jpg 
To change the permissions of all the files and subfolders (and all the 
files within those subfolders) in one fell swoop, you can add the -R (recur-
sive) flag to the chmod command. The command would thus be as follows: 
chmod -R 744 ~/photos/personal
The number 744, by the way, extends read, write, and execute (run) 
permissions to you, the owner, but gives read-only rights to everyone else—
a pretty safe choice when in doubt. If you want to figure out permission num-
bers for yourself, it is pretty easy. You are basically dealing with three number 
positions, each of which has eight numerical possibilities (0–7). The left slot 

166
Chapter 9
represents permissions for the owner, the center slot represents permissions 
for the group, and the third slot represents permissions for others.
The meanings of the numbers themselves are as follows:
Figure 9-7 points out the meaning of each of these numbers and what 
each number slot represents. In fact, if you don’t mind a bit of simple addition, 
things are even easier to understand. To start with, remember that 1 = execute, 
2 = write, and 4 = read. Add any of those numbers together, and you get the 
other permission combos. For example, 1 (execute) + 4 (read) = 5 (read and 
execute). As you can see, permissions aren’t all that complicated. 
Figure 9-7: The meaning of permission numbers
Now if you’re more of a letters than numbers sort of person, you’ll be 
happy to know that there is another way to change permissions that is proba-
bly even easier. In this approach, you have to deal only with two groups of let-
ters and the symbols + and -. 
The first group consists of the following:
7
Read, write, and execute permissions
6
Read and write permissions
5
Read and execute permissions
4
Read-only permissions
3
Write and execute permissions
2
Write-only permissions
1
Execute-only permissions
0
No permissions
u
User (owner of the file)
g
Group (specified group of users)
o
Others (anyone who is not the user or a member of the group)
a
All (all of the above)
764
The owner can read,
write, and execute
The group can read and write,
but not execute
Others can only read

167
The second group consists of the following:
You might already be able to figure out how this is all going to work, but 
I’ll spell it out just in case your intuition is worn out for the day. Let’s say you 
want to change the permissions of a file (butterhaters.txt, for example) so that 
all users on your machine can read and write to it. After opening a Terminal 
window, you can make the change by typing chmod a+rw butterhaters.txt and 
pressing ENTER. 
Oops! Just remembered that you don’t want anyone changing the con-
tent of the file, eh? Well, to take back the write permissions for that file, you 
just need to type chmod a-w butterhaters.txt and then press ENTER. As you can 
see, the + gives permissions, while the - taketh away.
That’s much simpler, you’ve got to admit.
$ sudo
When you ran the Ubuntu Software Center in Chapter 6, you were first asked 
to input your password before you could run the program. The reason for 
this, as I mentioned then, is that the Ubuntu Software Center installs the files 
it downloads in various folders throughout your system, almost all of which 
are write protected. By supplying your password, you are telling your system 
that you, as holder of the password, have the right to allow the Ubuntu Soft-
ware Center to do that.
The command version of that same password-giving process is the sudo 
command. To perform an operation in a folder that is write protected, you 
would first type sudo and then the command you want to perform. For example, 
if you wanted to copy an icon image, let’s call it myicon.png, to the globally 
located and write-protected pixmaps folder (/usr/share/pixmaps), you would 
type sudo cp myicon.png /usr/share/pixmaps.
After typing a command preceded by the sudo command and pressing 
ENTER, you will be prompted for your password. Once you type your pass-
word and press ENTER again, the command will be executed. I should men-
tion that once you input your password, it will stay in memory for about five 
minutes. This means that you will not be prompted for your password when 
using the sudo command again within that time frame.
$ locate
Now that you are familiar with the sudo command, let’s take it out for a spin 
by working with the locate command. The locate command is essentially a 
command-line alternative to the graphical Search tool found in the Places 
menu. Using the command is quite easy: Simply type the command followed 
by a space and the name of the file you want to find. 
r
Read
w
Write
x
Execute

168
Chapter 9
Before you can use this command, though, you will need to create a data-
base of filenames for locate to use. This is where using the sudo command, 
along with yet another command, updatedb, comes into play. Just type sudo 
updatedb, and press ENTER. After you type your password when asked to do so, 
it will seem that nothing is happening for a while, but don’t worry. As long as 
the cursor in your Terminal is blinking, progress is being made, and when 
your user prompt returns, you will have successfully created the database file. 
After that, you can use the locate command.
Oh, and in the future if you think that the process seems to be taking 
longer and longer, don’t worry—it is. The more files and applications you 
add to your system, the longer it will take your system to catalog them all.
To take this new command for a test drive, let’s look for the 
openofficeorg3-writer.png file that you worked with in Chapter 3. Just type the 
following, and press ENTER: 
locate openofficeorg3-writer.png
Your results should look like those in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8: The results of a locate search
$ apt-get
Let’s move on to a command that might seem a bit familiar to you: apt-get.  
Yes, this command is indeed a means of controlling the powerful package 
download and installation tool, APT, which I covered in Chapter 6. Although 
it might not be as pleasing to use APT via the command line as it is via the 
Ubuntu Software Center, doing so can come in handy. I’ll cover the basics 
for you here.
Just for fun and to get a bit of nontoxic practice with apt-get, open a Ter-
minal window, type apt-get moo, and press ENTER. The result of this endeavor, 
as you will see, is an example of another Easter egg lurking within your system 
(Figure 9-9). Useless, yes, but a safe first step in working with apt-get.

Simple Kitten Ways
169
Figure 9-9: Discovering an Easter egg via apt-get
To actually put the apt-get command to use, start by making sure to close 
any APT frontends you might have open, such as the Ubuntu Software Center. 
As I mentioned, you can run only one APT tool at a time. Once the coast is 
clear, you should always start out any operations involving apt-get with an 
update of the APT database so that you will be downloading the newest stuff. 
To do this, just type the command sudo apt-get update. 
If you want to install a single package without heading over to the Ubuntu 
Software Center, you can do so by typing sudo apt-get install package-name. 
For example, if you want to download and install the Shufflepuck game clone, 
Tuxpuck, you would type sudo apt-get install tuxpuck. If you eventually get 
annoyed with Tuxpuck after having lost one too many times, you can unin-
stall it by typing sudo apt-get remove tuxpuck.
Finally, bearing in mind all the warnings offered in Chapter 6, if you want 
to upgrade your entire system via the command line, you can do so by typing 
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (but only after doing a sudo apt-get update first).
$ aptitude
To wrap up this section, let’s finish with an increasingly popular alternative 
to apt-get, called aptitude.  One of the differences responsible for aptitude’s 
popularity is that it is considered to have superior dependency handling to 
apt-get; in addition, it is arguably easier to use, because of its semigraphical 
interface (Figure 9-10). Because of this hybrid graphical interface, a lengthy 
discussion of how to use aptitude would take us from the main purpose of this 
chapter, which is learning to work with commands. That being the case, I will 
only briefly touch upon its use.
Start aptitude by typing sudo aptitude in a Terminal window and pressing 
ENTER. To install a package, you would click Search in the blue menu ribbon 
at the top of the window, select Find in the drop-down menu that appears, 
type the name of the package you are looking for in the search box, and then 
click Ok (Figure 9-11).

170
Chapter 9
Figure 9-10: The semigraphical interface of aptitude
Figure 9-11: Performing a package search in aptitude
Back in the main aptitude screen, you would select the package you want, 
click Package in the blue menu strip at the top of the page, and then select 
Install. If you prefer, you can just press the + key after selecting the target 
package to accomplish the same thing. Your package should now appear in 
green text. You may select other packages to install at the same time in the 
same way. Once done, press G on your keyboard, and the download and 

Simple Kitten Ways
171
installation process will begin. If you are first presented with a screen telling 
you that certain packages will also be installed or removed, read through that 
screen, and then press G again to move on to the actual installation.
It is also possible to use aptitude strictly in command mode in almost the 
same manner as apt-get, using pretty much the same arguments. To make 
sure the package lists that aptitude uses are up-to-date, you would start with 
the command sudo aptitude update. To install a package, such as the puzzle 
game Tangrams (aka gtans), you would type sudo aptitude install gtans. You 
would uninstall the package by typing sudo aptitude remove gtans.
A Couple of Other Biters You’ll Be Using Soon
This is as good a place as any to introduce two more commands that you will 
be called upon to use in this chapter and elsewhere in the book: ln and tar. 
You needn’t practice with these yet, because you will be using them very soon, 
but you might as well know what they are all about.
$ ln
You use the ln (link) command to create a link file that launches or activates 
another file located in a separate folder. This is very useful when trying to 
activate a file that is buried deep in the subfolder of a subfolder of a sub-
folder somewhere on your hard disk. The command is very often used with 
the -s (symbolic) flag, which provides essentially the same thing as the short-
cut you’ve come to know in Windows or the alias on the Mac.
The easiest way to use the ln command is to first use the cd command to 
change the Terminal’s location to the folder where you want to place the 
link. Then you can type the ln command on the command line, followed by 
the path of the file to which you want to link. For example, let’s say you want 
to put a link in your home folder for an OpenOffice.org Writer file of your 
autobiography called myLife.odt.
The file is pretty well buried in a nest of subfolders deep within your home 
folder: /home/username/Documents/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.odt. To 
create the link, you would open a new Terminal window, type the following 
command string, and then press ENTER:
ln -s Documents/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.odt
Once you are finished, the link will appear in your home folder as an 
icon matching the original file in appearance, albeit sporting an arrow to 
signify that it is a link.
$ tar
In Chapter 7 you learned to create and extract archives, or tarballs, but did 
you know that you can also create and extract tarballs using the command 
line? The tar command is your key to doing this.

172
Chapter 9
To create an archive, you would simply type tar -cvf, followed by the 
name the final tarball will be, and then the name of the folder or file you are 
trying to archive. For example, let’s say you want to create an archive of your 
photos folder, and you want to call it pics4pals. In this case, you would type 
the following command and then press ENTER:
tar –cvf pics4pals.tar photos
As you no doubt noticed, there are some flags after the tar command in 
that string. The c tells the tar program to create a new archive. The v tells the 
program to be verbose, or, in other words, to tell you what it is doing in the 
Terminal as it is doing it. Finally, the f tells the program that what follows is 
the file information.
If, after creating the archive, you suddenly remember that there is one 
more file you want to add to the mix, you can use the -r flag to append the 
archive.
For example, to add a file called cranky.png to the archive, you would type 
the following and then press ENTER:
tar -rvf pics4pals.tar cranky.png
Of course, chances are that you will be doing more tarball extracting 
than creating, so you no doubt want to know how to do that. Fortunately, the 
process is pretty similar to what you use when creating the tarball. The main 
difference is in the first flag. Rather than using the tar command with the -c 
flag, you would instead use it with the -x flag, which tells the tar program to 
extract the specified archive. So if you want to extract a tarball called spicyfood.tar, 
type the following command, and press ENTER:
tar -xvf spicyfood.tar
What you have been doing thus far is creating and extracting archives, 
which are basically just collections of files. They are not, however, compressed. 
In fact, most tarballs you find will be compressed, and you can tell by the 
ending tar.gz. That gz means that the archive was compressed using the gzip 
program. Extracting a compressed tarball is just as easy as extracting a straight 
tar archive; all you have to do is add the -z flag, which tells your system to use 
the gzip program to decompress the archive. For example, if you want to 
extract a compressed tarball called goosedown.tar.gz, type the following command, 
and press ENTER:
tar -xzvf goosedown.tar.gz
Well, now that you know how to decompress and extract a gzipped tarball, 
you probably want to know how to create one. This is, again, little different 
than creating the tar archive itself; you would just add the -z tag to tell the 

Simple Kitten Ways
173
program to use gzip to compress the folder. For example, to create a com-
pressed version of your Documentia folder, which we’ll call tightdocs.tar.gz, you 
would type the following and press ENTER:
tar –czvf tightdocs.tar.gz Documentia
It’s worth mentioning at this point that you may also come across some 
files compressed with the bzip program. Such files are recognizable by some 
variation on the .bz or .bz2 file extension.  Dealing with these files should pose 
no problem, because the commands are almost identical to those for gzip. 
Just substitute -j for -z in the command string.
Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files
If you want to compress or decompress a single file, you don’t really need to 
use the tar program at all, since its purpose is to create archives consisting of 
several files. You can instead use the gzip and gunzip commands directly. For 
example, to compress a file called matilda.png, you would type gzip matilda.png 
and press ENTER. The matilda.png file would then become matilda.jpg.gz. To 
decompress the file, you would type gunzip matilda.jpg.gz and press ENTER, 
after which the matilda.jpg file would be back to normal.
So, can you compress an archive you’ve already created with the tar 
command? Sure. For example, to compress the spicyfood.tar archive mentioned 
earlier, you would type gzip spicyfood.tar, and voila—you’ve got yourslf a 
compressed spicyfood.tar.gz archive. Pretty cool, don’t you think?
Now that you have a bit of command experience, it’s time to get some prac-
tice and put all those commands to good use. In this project, you’ll start off 
easy by creating a .plan file, like the one mentioned earlier in the chapter.
The actual .plan file is a hidden file (as you can see by the dot before its 
name), which contains the plan or message that you add to that file. That 
message will appear in the output of someone’s Terminal when they use the 
finger command to find out more about you. You may not need such a .plan 
file, but it is an easy enough way to get started working a bit more with com-
mands and the Terminal itself, so let’s give it a try.
To start out, you’ll open the Terminal-based Pico editor to create the 
.plan file. To do this, open a Terminal window, type pico .plan (being sure to 
put a space between pico and .plan), and press ENTER. Your Terminal should 
now look a bit different, as you can see in Figure 9-12.
You will now be looking at your new, and totally empty, .plan file within 
the Pico editor. All you have to do now is type your plan or message. Once 
you’ve done that, press CTRL-X to exit the Pico editor, and it will ask you 
whether you want to save your work. You do, so type Y, after which you will be 
presented with a set of save options. You have already named the file .plan, as 
you can see near the bottom of the screen, so all you have to do is press ENTER. 
You will be back at your now-familiar user prompt in the Terminal window.
Project 9A: Creating a Plan

174
Chapter 9
Figure 9-12: The Pico editor
To wrap things up, you want to change the permission of the new .plan 
file by typing chmod 644 .plan in the Terminal window and then pressing ENTER. 
The .plan file should now be in your home folder and readable (see Note 
below) by all, so go on and test your work by typing finger username and press-
ing ENTER. The message you entered in your .plan file should now appear in 
the results in place of the no Plan you found there earlier. If you want to 
change the contents of your .plan file later, just follow the same steps, and 
change the text when the .plan appears in the Pico editor.
NOTE
The name of the .plan file is preceded by a period, which means that it is a hidden file. 
Thus, if you take a look in your home folder, you will not be able to see the file unless 
you have checked the Show hidden and backup files box in the Nautilus Preferences 
window.
Now let’s get some more experience with the Terminal by installing a simple, 
and admittedly kind of silly, oracle program called pyWings (see Figure 9-13). 
pyWings will give you cryptic guidance in response to whatever questions you 
may ask it.
To use pyWings, type whatever your confusion is in the input box, click 
one of the concern icons on the left (self, another, world), click one of the 
realm icons on the right (love, work, truth), and hit the big button that looks 
like half an eye. The oracle will then tell you what it has to say. As an example, 
I asked the oracle why I feel so down when the skies are so sunny, and I picked 
self as my concern and truth as the realm. Figure 9-14 shows the wisdom that 
was bestowed upon me.

176
Chapter 9
As you can see, the oracle told me, “What we bring closer, grows to us,” 
which I will interpret as . . . well, I’m not sure what to interpret it as.
Hmmm. 
pyWings was written in a programming language called Python, which 
actually creates scripts rather than true conventional programs. You will 
learn a little more about this distinction in later in the chapter, but one of 
the differences I can mention right off the bat is that you don’t actually have 
to install pyWings; you are simply going to put it on your hard drive in your 
home folder and run it from there, more or less as is. 
9B-1: Getting Ready for pyWings (Installing Tkinter)
As I mentioned, one difference between pyWings and most of the other 
applications you know is that pyWings is a Python script. To create a graphical 
interface for itself, pyWings uses a toolbox known as Tkinter, which is the de facto 
standard (though not the only) GUI toolbox for Python. Tkinter, however, 
no longer comes bundled with Ubuntu, so you will need to download and 
install it yourself. Fortunately, this is quite easily done.
Although it is possible to whip open the Ubuntu Software Center and 
install Tkinter by the simple means learned in Chapter 6, it seems more 
appropriate in this command line–oriented chapter to . . . yeah, you got it, 
use the command line. That said, open a Terminal window, type sudo apt-get 
install python-tk, and then press ENTER. When asked for your password, type 
it, and then press ENTER. APT will search the online repositories and find 
your file, along with anything else it requires to function properly. Once it is 
ready, it will ask you whether you want to continue. You do, so type y, and 
then press ENTER. When your username prompt reappears, you’ll know the 
job is done, and you can go on to the next step.
NOTE
If you prefer, you can perform this installation using aptitude instead, using the tech-
niques we discussed earlier in the chapter.
9B-2: Getting pyWings
You are just about ready to begin “installing” pyWings, but before you do, 
you need to get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywings/. Once there, 
click the View all files button, and then download the file pywings-1.1.tar.gz. 
Then place the file in your home folder so that you can follow along easily 
with the rest of this project.
9B-3: Creating a LocalApps Folder for pyWings
As I mentioned earlier, you will be installing the pyWings program locally in 
your home folder. Installing a program locally means that you are installing 
the program and all its support and data files in your home folder. This makes 
things a bit easier, but it also means that the program will not be available to 
other users. It also means that if you’re not careful, you might inadvertently 
delete it. 

Simple Kitten Ways
177
To make things a bit easier and safer for you, you are going to create a 
folder in your home folder in which to place pyWings and all other applica-
tions that you install locally on your machine in the future. You will, logically 
enough, call the folder LocalApps. 
Let’s make the folder using a command in order to get some more 
practice. Go to the Terminal, make sure you are in your home folder, type 
the following command, and then press ENTER:
mkdir LocalApps
9B-4: Extracting the pyWings Tarball
Now it is time to extract the tarball. You could do this by the double-click 
method you learned in Chapter 7, but since you’re working with the com-
mand line here, let’s use that instead. 
To start, you’re going to place the tarball in the same folder into which 
you extract its files. Usually this isn’t necessary because the contents of most 
tarballs are already packaged in a folder of their own. By double-clicking the 
tarball to open it in File Roller, you can see whether things are packed in a 
folder or simply as a group of files. In the case of pyWings, it is the latter, so 
follow these steps:
1.
Create a pywings folder by typing mkdir pywings and pressing ENTER.
2.
Move the pyWings tarball into that folder by typing mv pywings*.gz pywings 
and pressing ENTER.
You can see that in this step you used an asterisk (*) to save some 
wear and tear on your fingers. The asterisk is a wildcard character that in 
this case told your system to move any file beginning in pywings and end-
ing in .gz. Fortunately you had only one item matching those criteria.
3.
Move to the new pywings folder by typing cd pywings and pressing ENTER.
4.
Now you get down to the process of extracting the tarball itself using the 
tar command. To do this, type tar –xzvf pywings*.gz, and press ENTER.
Again, notice that you used the asterisk to save youself some key-
strokes, though you could just as well have typed -1.1.tar in its stead.
5.
Finally, type cd, and press ENTER to bring the Terminal back to your 
home folder.
9B-5: Moving the pyWings Folder to Your LocalApps Folder
The extraction process is now complete. Before going on to running pyWings, 
however, let’s move it to the new LocalApps folder you created in Project 9B-3. 
To do this, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
mv pywings LocalApps

9B-6: Running pyWings
Now that you have pyWings in place and ready for action, let’s start up the 
great oracle right now so that you can get a better perspective on how to deal 
with the aspects of life that trouble you. 
In the Terminal, make sure you are in your home directory, type the fol-
lowing command string, and then press ENTER:
python ~/LocalApps/pywings/pywings.py
Since pywings.py is a Python script, rather than an application, you are 
calling Python’s attention to that fact so that Python will know it needs to 
deal with that script. If all went according to plan, pyWings should be up and 
running and will soon be making you a wiser person.
9B-7: Creating a Launchable Link for pyWings
The method of running pyWings that you’ve just used works well enough, 
but it is a pain to open your Terminal and type that somewhat lengthy string 
every time you want to find out what fate has in store for you. Let’s find a way 
to make things easier in the future. 
To run an application from the Terminal, you generally type the name 
of that application, or, to put it more precisely, the name of that program’s 
executable file; the application’s name thus acts as a sort of command. For 
your system to recognize that command, however, the command (the execut-
able file or a link to it) must be in a location where the system can find it. 
Whenever you run a command of any sort, your system checks a series of 
locations (most of which are bin folders, where executable files are located) to 
find that command. 
You can easily find out where these locations are by typing echo $PATH in 
a new Terminal window and then pressing ENTER. As you will see, on your 
Ubuntu system, these locations are as follows: 
NOTE
The results of the echo $PATH command will not appear as they do in the easier-to-read 
chart shown here but, rather, in a single line divided by colons. The actual output 
shown in the Terminal is /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/
sbin:/bin:/usr/games.
If the command you typed is in one of those locations, the program, or 
script, will run. As you no doubt know, however, pyWings is not in any of 
those locations. It is in /home/username/LocalApps/pyWings and is thus, in a 
sense, out of your system’s sight.
/usr/local/bin
/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/usr/games
/usr/sbin

Simple Kitten Ways
179
To remedy this situation, you could add the path of your pyWings script 
to the list of paths that the system checks for run commands, so as to make 
the system aware of your new application’s existence. However, let’s try 
another method that I think is easier. What you will do is create a link to 
pyWings, a sort of launchable alias, in one of the locations your system does 
check for commands. 
To create this link, you will be using three commands: cd (to change 
directories), sudo (to give yourself write access to the destination folder), 
and ln -s (to create the link). 
1.
In the Terminal, type cd /usr/games, and press ENTER. This puts you in 
one of the folders your system searches when you enter commands.
2.
Type sudo ln -s /home/username/LocalApps/pywings/pywings.py pywings, and 
press ENTER. (Note that there is a space between the words pywings.py 
and pywings at the end of that command string.) 
The pywings at the end of that command string is the name that you 
are giving the link; the name of the link thus becomes the command you 
will use to run the application. If you type nothing, the link will be called 
pywings.py, which would mean three more keystrokes for you every time 
you wanted to start the program.
3.
Type your password when prompted to do so, and then press ENTER.
4.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
9B-8: Running pyWings Again
Now that you have created the link, you should be able to run the pyWings 
program much more easily. To try it, quit pyWings (if it is still running), type 
pywings in the Terminal window, and press ENTER. Your personal pyWings 
oracle should appear again.
You’ve managed to cut down on the number of keystrokes required to 
run pyWings from the Terminal. However, if you are really into this pyWings 
thing and want to use it often, it will probably be handiest to add a launcher 
to your panel, a drawer, or the Applications menu. 
To add a pyWings panel launcher, for example, right-click any open 
space in the panel, and select Add to Panel. When the Add to Panel window 
appears, click the Custom Application Launcher item, and click Add. In the 
Create Launcher window that appears, type pyWings in the Name section, any-
thing you want in the Comment section (Your Obtuse Guru, for example), and, 
assuming you created a launchable link in Project 9B-7, type pywings in the 
Command section. For an icon, click the No Icon button, and then look 
around until you find an icon that suits your fancy. I like gnome-eog.png 
myself. Once you’ve made your selection, click Add in the Browse icons 
window, and then click OK in the Create Launcher window.

9B-9: Adding Emblems to Your LocalApps Folder
Now that pyWings is successfully installed and working, it is probably a good 
idea to add an emblem to your new LocalApps folder so that you don’t inad-
vertently dump it in the Trash someday. You already learned how to do this 
in Chapter 8, so I won’t give you the step-by-step instructions.
If you want to reinforce the skills you’ve put to use in the previous project, 
why not go a bit Continental and try Briscola—a simple, yet very traditional, 
Italian card game (see Figure 9-15)? Unlike pyWings, which is a Python script, 
Briscola is a script of a different flavor, written in a scripting language called 
Tcl, which uses something called Tk to create its graphical interface.
Figure 9-15: Briscola
9C-1: Getting Briscola
You are just about ready to begin “installing” Briscola, but before you do, you 
must get it. You can get Briscola by going to the project’s home page at http://
www.rigacci.org/comp/software/ and downloading it in the traditional manner, 
but since we’re working with commands, let’s instead get Briscola by using a 
new command: wget. 
To do this, just open a Terminal window, type the following command 
string, and then press ENTER:
wget http://www.rigacci.org/comp/software/briscola/briscola-4.1.tar.gz

181
NOTE
If you have any trouble downloading Briscola in this way, you can also download it 
from the site for this book: http://www.edgy-penguins.org/UFNG/.
In your Terminal window, you will see wget in action as it connects to the 
site where Briscola is stored and then downloads the file. When it’s done, you 
will find the Briscola tarball in your home folder.
9C-2: Extracting the Briscola Tarball and Renaming the Briscola Folder
Extracting the Briscola tarball is essentially the same process as that for pyWings; 
however, Briscola is already packaged within its own folder, so you won’t 
have to create a special folder for it. 
Although I am sure you now know the drill, I’ll tell you again. Just open a 
Terminal window, type the following command, and press ENTER:
tar –xzvf briscola*.gz 
A new folder, Briscola-4.1, will now appear in your home folder with all 
the Briscola files in it. To make things easier to deal with in the future, let’s 
shorten the name of the folder to simply briscola. You already know how to do 
this via the right-click method, but this time around let’s to do it via the com-
mand line. To do this, you use, perhaps surprisingly, the mv command followed 
by the name of the file whose name you are going to change, followed by the 
new name of the file.
Give it a go by typing the following command and pressing ENTER:
mv briscola-4.1 briscola
9C-3: Preparing the Briscola Script
Most applications that come in tarball form include a README file, which 
includes information on what you need to do to install and use the applica-
tion. If you double-click the README file in the briscola folder in Nautilus, 
you will see that the “HOW TO START” section tells you to adjust the first line 
of the briscola.tk script to point it to your Tk shell, and to adjust the second 
line of the script to point to the directory where the various Briscola files are 
located. 
To perform the adjustments as instructed in the README file, just fol-
low these steps:
1.
Find the Tk shell, called Wish, by typing locate wish in the Terminal 
window and pressing ENTER, and then note the location given on a piece 
of paper. You may get a number of locations in your search results, but 
the one you want is /usr/bin/wish.
2.
Direct the Terminal to the briscola folder by typing cd briscola and press-
ing ENTER.

182
Chapter 9
3.
Use the Pico editor, which we used in Project 9A, to edit the briscola.tk 
file by typing pico briscola.tk and pressing ENTER. The briscola.tk file will 
appear in the Pico editor in your Terminal window.
4.
Change the very first line of the briscola.tk file from #!/usr/local/bin/wish 
to #!/usr/bin/wish.
5.
In the second line, change /usr/local/games/briscola to /usr/share/games/
briscola, which is where you will place Briscola in just a bit. Your editor 
window should now look like Figure 9-16.

6.
Press CTRL-X on your keyboard.
7.
Type y, and press ENTER to save your changes.
8.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
9C-4: Moving the Briscola Folder to a Global Location
You could move the briscola folder to the LocalApps folder and play it from 
there, as you did with pyWings, but this time around, let’s do things a bit dif-
ferently by moving the whole thing to global territory. This not only keeps it 
safe from any obsessive housekeeping tendencies but also allows all users on 
the same computer to play the game. You will need to use the sudo command 
to do this so that you can have write access in those protected folders. 
To do this, just type the following command in the Terminal window, 
and press ENTER:
sudo mv briscola /usr/share/games
When you are prompted for your password, type it, and press ENTER. 

Simple Kitten Ways
183
9C-5: Creating a Launchable Link for Briscola
Even though you’ve moved Briscola to a global location, you still can’t run it 
with a simple one-word command because the briscola.tk file is not in the system’s 
command search path. Just as you did for pyWings, you will now create a 
launchable link for Briscola to solve that problem. Here are the steps:
1.
In the Terminal, type cd /usr/games, and press ENTER.
2.
Now create the link by typing sudo ln -s /usr/share/games/briscola/
briscola.tk briscola, and press ENTER.
3.
Type cd, and press ENTER to return the Terminal to your home folder.
You can now easily run Briscola by typing briscola in the Terminal and 
pressing ENTER.
Can You Do the Same Thing with pyWings?
Sure. If you want to move pyWings to a global location, just follow the same 
procedure for moving the pywings folder and creating the link as you did for 
Briscola, making the necessary substitutions, of course. You will have to 
remove the previously created pyWings link, though, by typing the following 
command and pressing ENTER:
sudo rm /usr/games/pywings
After that, move the pywings folder to global territory by typing sudo mv ~/
LocalApps/pywings /usr/share/games/pywings and pressing ENTER. When prompted 
for your password, type it, and press ENTER. You can then create the launch-
able link by typing cd /usr/games, pressing ENTER, typing sudo ln -s /usr/share/
games/pywings/pywings.py pywings, and pressing ENTER once more.
Playing Briscola
As I already mentioned, Briscola is easy—about as easy a card game as there 
is. It is a trick-taking game, which means that you put out a card and then 
your opponent puts out a card, and the one who puts out the higher point-
value card wins the hand, or trick. Points are awarded on the basis of the 
cards involved in that trick. The winner of the trick then goes on to lead the 
next trick, meaning that the winner puts out his or her card first the next 
time around. When all the cards are played, the points for each player are 
then tallied, and the player with the higher points wins. It’s much simpler to 
do than it is to describe.

Chapter 9
Though it was far more common in the earlier days, compiling programs from 
source seems to be a phrase you still hear more in the Linux world than in any 
other. For the beginner, just the mention of compiling a program from source 
seems off-putting enough. The words compile and source seem to instill a sense 
of foreboding in the heart of the new user. That certainly was the case for 
me, anyway. 
You can live long and prosper without ever bothering to compile any-
thing on your system. You can move along quite happily with your system as 
is, or you can just install programs by means of the much more convenient 
Ubuntu Software Center. Still, once in the Linux world, you are likely to come 
across this installation method and may well become curious, especially if 
you move into the geekier side of the community.
So, What Is Source?
To get started, it is probably a good idea to understand what source is so as 
to help you to understand a bit about how a program actually gets from its 
primitive state on the programmer’s computer to an up-and-running applica-
tion on your machine. First the programmer writes a program in a program-
ming language. You have probably heard of programming languages such as 
BASIC or C, and there are many others. What the programmer actually writes 
with such a language is a set of instructions called the source code, or source. 
Your computer, however, cannot actually understand any of that source on 
its own. It is as if the computer speaks ancient Greek, and the source code is 
all written in French. The computer therefore needs some sort of interpreter 
to help it out.
The various languages that programmers use are called high-level languages—
they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, on the other 
hand, only understands low-level languages, which are quite difficult for most 
mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the high-level language 
instructions to a low-level language, the computer needs some other program 
to translate.
If this translation process actually takes place while a program is running, 
the translator program is called an interpreter. Applications that run using an 
interpreter are usually called scripts. The pyWings and Briscola applications 
earlier in this chapter are examples of such script applications.
The problem with such scripts is that they can be slower than most of the 
applications you’re familiar with—the computer must run an interpreter, 
interpret the source code, and run the actual application all at the same 
time. This is like having a French book translated into Greek by a live inter-
preter; it’s very slow indeed.
As an alternative, most programs use a compiler instead of an interpreter. 
A compiler translates the high-level source code into low-level machine code, 
or object code, that the computer can understand before the application is 
Project 9D: Compiling and Installing Programs from Source: 
Xmahjongg

Simple Kitten Ways
185
actually run. Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother 
with the high-level instructions again; it can merely read the translated ver-
sion each time it runs the program. This is like having a translated version of 
a foreign book that you can read any time you want. Because computers can 
run compiled programs without simultaneously using an interpreter, com-
piled programs run faster than scripts. Most applications for all operating sys-
tems are, therefore, compiled.
The Basics
The actual process of compiling an application from source and then installing 
it is quite simple—a truly “one, two, three” bit of presto change-o. Basically, 
after extracting the source code from an archived file (usually in the form of 
a tarball), you would use the following commands to accomplish the task:
./configure
To configure a makefile, which provides instructions for the 
make command
make
To translate the source code into object code that the computer 
can understand
sudo make install
To give yourself write privileges in protected folders 
and then install the application
make clean
To tidy up the leftovers once the process is complete (to 
clean up the mess)
I know that sounds like a lot of commands, but as I always say, it is easier 
to actually do than it looks like on the page, so fear not.
9D-1: Installing the Tools You Need
Before doing anything else, you have to get your system ready to do what 
you’re about to ask of it. Because Ubuntu is designed with the average com-
puter user in mind, it does not come with the various applications and libraries 
you need to compile applications from source. Fortunately, however, every-
thing you need to get the job done is available via the Ubuntu Software Center. 
To get ready for the work at hand in this chapter (and many other jobs you 
are likely to do on your own in the future), perform searches for and install 
the following packages:
z
build-essential
z
libgtk2.0-dev
9D-2: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg File
To get some hands-on experience with compiling a program from source, you 
will be working with a game called Xmahjongg, which you can see in Figure 9-17. 
If you’ve tried the version of Mahjongg that comes with your Ubuntu distri-
bution, you will notice that this one is much easier on your eyes and is a bit 
more colorful (check out the project site at http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/ to 
catch a glimpse of it in its full-color glory). 

186
Chapter 9
Figure 9-17: The Xmahjongg game
Xmahjongg is available via the Ubuntu Software Center, so it is not abso-
lutely necessary to install it in the way you are about to, but doing so provides 
a perfect opportunity to learn how to compile a program from source. The 
amount of source code isn’t all that great, so it won’t take too much time to 
do, and it requires no tinkering.
To get started, you will first have to download the Xmahjongg source code. 
You can get this from the Xmahjongg project page at http://www.lcdf.org/
xmahjongg/. Download the tarball xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz, or a newer version if 
there is one. Do not download any of the other file types available on that page. 
If you prefer, you can instead download the Xmahjongg tarball by using 
the wget command that you learned in Project 9C-1. Just open a Terminal 
window, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
wget http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz
Once you have the file on your hard disk, untar the xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz 
file. You can do this either by using the command line, as you learned to do 
earlier in the chapter, or by double-clicking the file and dragging its contents 
into the appropriate folder. To make it easier for you to follow along with the 
directions I’ll be giving you, be sure to place the untarred Xmahjongg folder 
in your home folder. Then you will be ready to roll.
Normally at this point, you would look through the folder to find some 
instructions for dealing with the package, just as you did earlier in the chapter 
for Briscola. In most source code packages, this information is included in an 
INSTALL file, like the one in the xmahjongg-3.7 folder (Figure 9-18). To read 
the INSTALL file, just double-click it, and it will open in Gedit.

Simple Kitten Ways
187
In this case, you can simply close the INSTALL file, because it prescribes 
the same steps I’ve listed next. However, in the future, when you install other 
programs from source, you will need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL 
files that come with the source files. However, with most INSTALL files, the 
instructions will match the process I am about to describe.
Of course, it may well happen that you take a look at the contents of the 
INSTALL file and start wondering what alien tongue it is written in. In cases 
when you have no idea what the INSTALL file is going on about, just look for 
a configure file in the package folder. If you find one, you should be able to 
follow the instructions in this project.
Figure 9-18: Identifying a package’s INSTALL file
9D-3: Running configure and make for Xmahjongg
Now that you have downloaded and untarred the Xmahjongg tarball, instal-
lation is pretty standard. Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Open a Terminal window, and then move into the new folder by typing 
cd xmahjongg* and pressing ENTER.
The next step is sort of a setup phase that runs the configure script 
in the xmahjongg-3.7 folder. The configure script checks what files, com-
pilers, and other things it needs, and then it searches your computer to 
see whether those things are there and, if so, where. Based on this infor-
mation, it writes a file called a makefile, which is a set of instructions that 
will tell the make command in the subsequent step how to set things up 
specifically for your system configuration.

188
Chapter 9
2.
Configure the program by typing ./configure and pressing ENTER. 
While you are running configure, you will see lots of odd and mysteri-
ous things flowing through your Terminal window; this is essentially a 
running account of what is going on, each step of the way. This can take 
a bit of time, but don’t worry. As long as the mysterious text keeps flowing 
and you don’t get an error message at the very end of the whole process, 
all will be well. 
When configure has done its thing, you will see your prompt again, 
and you can go on to the next step, which is the translation, or compilation, 
step. The make command reads the makefile created by configure to see 
how things need to be set up on your machine. Then it proceeds to call 
on the compiler to translate the high-level source code into low-level, 
machine-readable files that can be installed in the subsequent step. 
3.
To perform this translation, type make, and press ENTER.
Again, you will be treated to even more mysterious text flowing 
through the window and a short wait, usually a tad longer than for the 
configure process. Once make has done its job and you see your prompt 
again, you are ready to install the program. 
Up to this point, you have not changed your system in any way. All the 
changes thus far have taken place in the xmahjongg-3.7 folder only—your 
system is still as pure as the day you started. Of course, all that is going to end 
right now when you perform the final installation step.
9D-4: Installing and Running Xmahjongg
Now you’ve come to the last step in this part of the process, make install. Here 
you are telling your system to install what you have created, or compiled, in the 
make step. Note that because installation takes place in permissions-protected 
parts of your system, you will need to add sudo to the command string to give 
yourself administrative privileges.
To perform the installation, type sudo make install, and press ENTER. You 
will then be prompted for your password. After typing it and pressing ENTER, 
the installation process will take place. Once your Terminal brings you back 
to your user prompt, Xmahjongg will be installed and ready to run. As a 
general rule, programs compiled from source do not automatically install a 
launcher in your Applications menu; you must instead run them by command. 
Although you can run a program for the first time by typing a command in 
the Run Application panel applet, it is better to run the program for the first 
time by typing the command in your Terminal window. If anything has gone 
amiss during installation, the Terminal will tell you what the problem is, 
whereas the Run Application method would just leave you wondering what’s 
going on.
To run Xmahjongg, just type xmahjongg in a Terminal window, and then 
press ENTER. If everything goes as it should, you can then create a program 
launcher for Xmahjongg in your Applications menu, on the GNOME Panel, 
or in a panel drawer.

189
9D-5: Cleaning Up and/or Uninstalling Xmahjongg
Once you are done and everything seems to be working as it should, you would 
normally tidy things up in the Xmahjongg folder by getting rid of any unnec-
essary files. You can do this via the Terminal by using the cd command to go 
back into the Xmahjongg folder, typing make clean, and then pressing ENTER. 
If you want to uninstall Xmahjongg, open a Terminal window, go back 
to the Xmahjongg folder by using the cd command, type sudo make uninstall, 
and finally press ENTER. The routine is essentially the same for any applica-
tions installed in this way, though as you might imagine, uninstallation isn’t 
always as smooth a process as what I’ve just described (and it’s definitely not 
as easy as it is via the Ubuntu Software Center).
The main reason for the uninstallation process being less than coopera-
tive is that the make uninstall routine requires you to keep the original project 
folder, which means you have to keep a bit of clutter you normally wouldn’t 
need to bother with. On top of this, some projects do not provide a make unin-
stall routine at all. This means that you have to keep track of where every-
thing has been installed in your system and then remove each item using a 
series of sudo rm commands.
All that negativity aside, go ahead, have some fun, and put your command-
line skills to the test. You’ll have something to tell your grandkids about in 
the future.
Customizing the Terminal
The Terminal is a very simple application in terms of looks, though you can 
spice things up a bit if you’re so inclined. Not only can you change the back-
ground and text colors in the Terminal, but you can even display one of your 
favorite photos as a background (as shown in Figure 9-19) or make the back-
ground transparent.
To change the Terminal background, go to the Terminal, and select 
EditProfiles. When the Profiles window appears, select the profile you 
want to edit, which the first time out would be Default, and then click the 
Edit button. In the Editing Profile window that appears, click the Background 
tab, select Background image (Figure 9-20), and then navigate to the photo 
you want to use as your background by clicking the Menu button next to the 
words Image file and then finding the file in the Select Background Image 
window. When you’ve found the photo of your choice, click Open. Depend-
ing on the image you use for your background, you may find it rather diffi-
cult to see the text once your image appears in the Terminal. If so, try moving 
the slider under the words Shade transparent or image background in the Editing 
Profile window. If that still doesn’t do the trick, click the Colors tab, deselect 
Use colors from system theme, and then try some of the preset Foreground 
and Background combinations from the menu button next to the words 
Built-in schemes.

190
Chapter 9
Figure 9-19: A Terminal window with customized background and font colors
Figure 9-20: Customizing the Terminal window
If you just want to make the background transparent, go back to the 
Background tab, select Transparent background, and drag the slider to the 
right. You can also use the slider to adjust the shading of your background 
image if you choose to go that route.

Simple Kitten Ways
191
Depending on the colors present in your background image or in your 
desktop wallpaper (if you’ve gone the transparent route), you may also want 
to change the font color for your Terminal to make things easier to see. To 
do this, click the Colors tab, deselect Use colors from system theme, and 
then make the appropriate font color selection.
Tabbed Shell Sessions in the Terminal
To wrap things up in this chapter, I thought I might mention one particu-
larly convenient feature of the GNOME Terminal: tabs. Just as you can view mul-
tiple web pages in one Firefox web browser window through the use of tabs, 
tabs in the Terminal application allow you to have more than one shell ses-
sion running at the same time without having more Terminal windows open 
(see Figure 9-21). This reduces the amount of desktop clutter and generally 
makes things easier to deal with. You can open a new tab within the Termi-
nal by going to the Terminal and selecting FileOpen Tab.

Setting Up and Using Your Printer and Scanner
Two of the most common computer periph-
erals are printers and scanners. This only 
makes sense, because it is those two tools 
that turn a web-surfing, game-playing, music-
churning, number-crunching box of chips into a mean-
ingful production tool—a virtual publishing house, if 
you will. These two tools help your computer convert
digital information into hard copy (in the case of printers) and convert hard 
copy into digital information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising, 
therefore, that these tools often come together these days in the form of mul-
tifunction printers.
In this chapter, you will learn how to connect these useful devices to your 
computer, how to set them up, and how to use them. If you’re more into work-
ing with your digital camera than with a scanner, you might want to sneak a 
peek at Chapter 13; otherwise, put on your printer’s smock, and read on.

194
Chapter 10
Printers
Unless the only thing you use your computer for is playing games, listening 
to MP3s, or stopping doors on hot, breezy days, you will no doubt want to 
hook up your machine to a printer. Despite the paperless-office era that the 
personal computer was supposedly going to usher in, it seems that the com-
puter’s strength as a desktop-publishing and general work tool has made pro-
ducing high-quality printed documents an even more attractive proposition 
than ever before.
Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported
Setting up a printer to work with your new system is a pretty easy task, and it 
seems that printer support in the Linux world gets better with each release. 
In general, support for Epson, Brother, Samsung, and Hewlett-Packard printers 
is good, while support for other makers and other printer types is a bit spottier 
(though improving).
If you really want to make sure your printer is supported, just try it by 
following the instructions in the next section. If you are thinking about 
buying a printer or are trying to decide whether to switch to Linux, go to http://
www.linuxprinting.org/. On that site, you can check out the online database to see 
whether your printer is currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings 
for supported printers also include information on what drivers are best for your 
purposes. There is also a page of suggested makes and models, in case you’re 
considering buying a printer with the intent of using it with your Linux system. 
Read this before making your purchase decision. You might also want to consult 
Ubuntu’s list at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/.
Getting Ubuntu to Automatically Recognize and Set Up Your Printer
Printer handling in Ubuntu is pretty much a no-brainer, because Ubuntu 
automatically detects most printers. If you have a USB printer, connect it to 
your computer, and then power up the printer (vice versa should work just 
fine, too). Assuming Ubuntu recognizes your printer, and chances are it will, 
a small printer icon will appear in the upper-right panel while the system goes 
through its automatic setup routine. When it is done, a small notification 
bubble like the one in Figure 10-1 will appear, telling you that your printer 
has been recognized. There is nothing more for you to do in this case—your 
printer is set up and ready to roll.
It is also possible, however, that Ubuntu will recognize your printer but 
not find a driver that is an exact match for it. In this case, it will offer a substi-
tute driver, and the autorecognition window will look slightly different from 
the one in Figure 10-1.

Gutenbird
195
Figure 10-1: Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically 
recognized and configured your printer.
If you find yourself in this situation, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to print a 
test page to see whether the substituted driver works as it should. You can do 
this by clicking SystemAdministrationPrinting and then double-clicking 
your printer in the Printing window that appears. A Printer Properties window 
will open; make sure that Settings is selected from the list to the left of the 
window and then click the Print Test Page button (Figure 10-2). If the test 
page looks normal (something like Figure 10-3), things should be fine, and 
you can close the Printer Properties and Printing windows.
Figure 10-2: Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window
If you have a printer that plugs into your computer’s parallel port, auto-
detection and setup should also work if the printer was connected when you 
turned on the computer. If it was not, shut down your system and turn your 
computer off, connect your printer to the computer, turn on the printer, 
and then start your computer again. With luck, your printer should be recog-
nized and set up automatically this time around. You can also try this same 
approach with a USB printer that was not recognized initially.

Manually Configuring Printers
If your printer isn’t automatically recognized, you can still set things up man-
ually. Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Select SystemAdministrationPrinting. A Printing window will appear, 
showing the printers that have already been recognized and/or configured.
2.
Click the Add button, after which the system will show any new finds in a 
New Printer window (Figure 10-4).
3.
Click the entry for your printer in the left pane of that window, and then 
click Forward.
4.
The system will then begin searching for drivers for your printer and will 
identify the make of your printer in the next screen of the wizard. Check 
that the correct make is selected, and then click Forward.
5.
On the next screen, your printer model should appear in the left pane, 
while the recommended driver will appear in the right pane (Figure 10-5). 
Click Forward.

6.
In the final screen of the wizard, fill in the blanks to suit your needs, and 
then click Apply, after which the wizard will close and you’ll be asked 
whether you’d like to print a test page. To make sure that everything is 
hunky-dory, it is always a good idea to print a test page, so click Yes.
Your system will send a test document to your printer and let you know it 
has done so in a small window, which you can close. The printer should print 
the test page shortly.
NOTE
If your test page didn’t come out the way it should or if your printer wasn’t configured 
automatically or correctly by the system, check out http://www.linuxprinting.org/ 
to see whether there are any special requirements or caveats for your model.
Setting Up Printers Connected Over a Network
If you want to use a printer connected via a home or office network, just follow 
these steps:
1.
Select SystemAdministrationPrinting. A Printing window will appear, 
showing the printers that have already been recognized and/or configured.
2.
Click the Add button, after which the New Printer window will appear.

For the Driverless Among You
As I mentioned, Linux does not yet have built-in support for some printers. 
For those of you who find yourselves with such printers, you can take a few 
routes in order to get things working.
Checking the Connections
You’d be surprised how many times I have triumphantly solved someone’s 
printer problems by simply turning on the printer or wiggling or replugging 
the USB or parallel connectors. Printers that are powered down and/or that 
have loose connections are often to blame if the printer’s model name fails 
to appear in the first page of the printer setup wizard.
If that approach fails, browse to http://www.linuxprinting.org/, because it 
is sometimes the case that Linux can support certain printers only if they are 
connected via the parallel port, even if they work via USB in other systems.
Trying Your Windows Drivers
If your printer came with an installation disc, you might want to see whether 
you can find a driver for it there. The driver on such a disc should end in .ppd 
(for “PostScript printer description”). To use one of these drivers, try adding 
your printer as described earlier, but when you get to the New Printer window 
where you select your printer’s make, click the Provide PPD file option. Then 
try to locate the appropriate file by clicking the button that says (None) in 
the middle of the page. If you find your driver, click the Forward button, and 
then continue the printer setup.
Using Third-Party Drivers
Recently, more Linux printer drivers are becoming available. If you don’t find 
your printer on that second page of the printer setup wizard, just try googling 
the make and model of your printer plus the word linux. In the past, for exam-
ple, I had a laser printer that did not appear at http://www.linuxprinting.org/, 
so I googled the printer, samsung+SCX4100+linux, which led me to http://
www.driverstock.com/, a site that provides free printer drivers for most operating 
systems, including Linux. On that site, I found not only the driver for my 
printer but also the driver for its built-in scanner.
You might also want to check the website for the manufacturer of your 
printer, because many now provide Linux drivers for a number of their print-
ers. Brother, Lexmark, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Samsung do, to name a 
few. There is also a German company (http://www.turboprint.info/) that provides 
Linux drivers, albeit for a fee, for machines that are really hard to deal with 
and for high-quality graphics solutions.
If you happen to find and download a driver for your printer that does 
not come with its own installer, just follow the directions given for trying 
Windows drivers. Finally, don’t forget to give the Ubuntu forums (http://
www.ubuntuforums.org/) a try to see whether anyone there has any experience 
getting the printer in question to work on their system.

200
Chapter 10
Trial and Error
Finally, there is always the old trial-and-error approach, which works on occa-
sion. When setting up your printer via the wizard window, try choosing one 
of the other printer models and/or drivers available from your printer’s 
manufacturer.
After you are done with the wizard, double-click the printer you added in 
the Printing window, click the Settings tab, and then click the Print Test Page 
button to see what happens. If nothing happens, click the Change button at 
the far right end of the Make and Model row on the Settings screen, select a 
different printer model and/or driver, and then, back on the Settings screen, 
click the Print Test Page button again. Repeat that process until something 
works. With any luck, something will . . . might . . . well, just give it a try if 
you’re desperate.
Printing Details
Now that your printer is set up, you will no doubt want to start printing! This 
is an easy task, and it isn’t very different from how it works in the Windows 
and Mac worlds, so you shouldn’t need much explanation to proceed. In fact, 
printing in Ubuntu has become easier than ever, because all the settings you 
would normally want to toy with are all on their own tabs within the Print 
window that appears when you select Print in an application’s File menu. I 
would even dare say that figuring out printing options in Ubuntu is now eas-
ier than it is in Windows or OS X.
You should be aware that the function of the tabs can vary depending on 
the application you happen to be printing from. For instance, the tabs you’ll 
see when printing from the GIMP will be slightly different from those you 
will see when printing from Firefox. The General and Page Setup tabs will 
almost always be there, however. All that said, I’ll give you an idea of some of 
the settings that are available within some of the Print window’s tabs:
General
Printer selection, pages to print, number of copies, order of 
printing, collating
Page Setup
Pages per sheet, scaling, paper type, paper source, output tray
Options
Print frames, shrink to fit page, print background, headers 
and footers
Image Settings
Size, resolution, page positioning
Job
Print timing (now, later, at time), cover page
Image Quality/Advanced
Output resolution (DPI), printing speed and 
quality

Printing in OpenOffice.org
Occasionally, you will come across an application such as OpenOffice.org 
that has a slightly different way of handling printing. Fortunately, the differ-
ences may actually make printing in OpenOffice.org more Windows-like and 
thus easier for newbies from the Windows world to follow along with. As you 
can see in Figure 10-7, the main Print window for OpenOffice.org applications 
allows you to select the printer you want to use, the range of pages, and how 
many copies you want to print. You can access other options by clicking the 
Properties and/or Options buttons.
Figure 10-7: Print settings in OpenOffice.org modules
Printing to PDF
One of the nice features of Linux is that you can save most documents or web 
pages as PDF files. In some cases, such as in OpenOffice.org, you do this by 
exporting the document to PDF. In most other applications, however, you do 
it via the Print window, in which case you are said to be “printing to PDF.” 
Whether you are saving as PDF, exporting to PDF, or printing to PDF, you are 
essentially doing the same thing: creating a PDF file of your document.
This is very handy, because it allows you to create documents that cannot 
be altered by others and yet can easily be read regardless of the word proces-
sor program or operating system the reader is using. Best of all, this feature, 
which you would have to pay a pretty penny for in the Windows world, costs 
you nothing, because it is built in to your system.
In most GNOME applications (and now in Firefox, too), you can print to 
PDF by going to the File menu of the application in question and selecting 
Print. When the Print window (Figure 10-8) appears, select Print to File in 
the list of printers, and make sure PDF is selected as the output format. Choose 
a name for the PDF file, and then click the Print button to save it.

Canceling a Print Job
It happens to all of us. You wanted to print just 1 page of a 57-page document, 
but you accidentally started printing the whole thing. What can you do to 
save your ink and 56 sheets of paper? Fortunately, the solution is simple.
Once you’ve clicked the Print button and the print job is sent to your 
printer, a small printer icon will appear somewhere at the right end of the 
top GNOME panel (usually to the left of the other items there), as you can 
see in Figure 10-9.
Figure 10-9: A printer icon appears in the 
GNOME panel while printing.
Just click that icon once, and a window showing your current and queued 
print jobs will appear (as shown in Figure 10-10). Your errant print job will be 
listed in that window, so right-click the name of the job to select it, and then, 
in the pop-up menu, select Cancel. You’ll be asked whether you really want 
to cancel the job; click Yes.
After you do this, the print job listed in the queue window will disappear, 
and your printer will stop printing. You can then close the print queue win-
dow. This is a very easy process that you may well find is more effective than 
what you’ve experienced in other operating systems.

Gutenbird
203
Figure 10-10: Canceling a print job via the print queue window
In some cases, things will be even easier, particularly if you installed your 
printer driver yourself by means of the installer that came packaged with the 
driver. In many such cases, the driver will provide its own progress window 
that will appear whenever you print a document. If so, you can simply click 
the Cancel button (or equivalent) in that window to cancel the printing job.
NOTE
In some cases, you may have to clear your printer after canceling a print job. You can 
do this by turning your printer off, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it on again.
Checking Ink Levels and Other Printer Maintenance Tasks
Printer ink (and toner) has a knack of vanishing at a rate of knots, so it’s 
natural to want to check up on how your cartridges are doing. You might also 
run into problems with the printer, such as streaks on printouts or jagged 
lines that should really be straight, so it might be necessary to clean or align 
the print heads too. Unfortunately, there’s no one simple method of doing 
this since every make of printer handles it differently. I’ll just mention a few 
ways you can access these options for the most common brands:
HPLIP
This works only for Hewlett-Packard printers. Open the 
Ubuntu Software Center, and install HPLIP Toolbox. Select System
PreferencesHPLIP Toolbox to run it, and use the Supplies tab to 
check ink levels and the Actions tab to align and clean your cartridges.
Inkblot
This works for a number of Epson, Canon, and HP printers—
check http://libinklevel.sourceforge.net/#supported/ to see whether your printer 
is supported. Open the Ubuntu Software Center, install Inkblot, and then 
select ApplicationsSystem ToolsInkblot to check your ink levels.
escputil
This works for some Epson printers and is worth a try if Ink-
blot doesn’t support your model. Open the Ubuntu Software Center, 
and install escputil. Then, open a Terminal by selecting Applications
AccessoriesTerminal. Type escputil -i (don’t forget the space) and hit 
ENTER to display the ink levels. To clean the print head, type escputil -c.

204
Chapter 10
If you have no luck with these utilities or if your printer’s make isn’t listed, 
you might still be able to access ink levels and maintenance functions using 
the manufacturer’s own Linux driver, if one exists. Also, some newer printers 
allow you to check ink levels and align and clean cartridges using controls on 
the printer. When in doubt, check your printer’s manual.
Scanners
Scanners are extremely useful and about as cheap a peripheral device as you 
can get. They allow you to take images or pages of text and input them, in 
digital form, into your computer—in much the same way as you would dupli-
cate a document on a copy machine.
Even though scanners have been around for a relatively long time, support 
for them in Linux is still a bit spotty. Fortunately, this is changing for the better 
with every new Linux release. The backend—the hidden part of your system 
that handles scanner recognition and support in Linux—is called Sane. If 
you are wondering whether Linux will be able to recognize your scanner or 
if you are trying to figure out what type of scanner to buy, you can visit the 
Sane website at http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html/.
There you will be able to see whether your scanner is supported or get 
tips about what scanner to buy. The page is pretty long, so you might want to 
use the Find function in your web browser (select EditFind in Firefox) to 
search for your scanner model. As I have mentioned, you can also try the 
Ubuntu forums (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/) and ask for Ubuntu-specific 
recommendations there.
Scanning, No Questions Asked, with Simple Scan
Simple Scan is a new addition to Ubuntu’s line-up of default applications, and 
it certainly lives up to its name—it doesn’t take many clicks to get a document 
from scanner bed to computer screen. To run Simple Scan, make sure that 
your scanner is connected and switched on, and then select Applications
GraphicsSimple Scan. If you get a warning saying that no scanners were 
detected, skip to “Unrecognized Scanners” on page 207.
Assuming that your scanner has been recognized, you’ll be presented 
with the screen in Figure 10-11.
It’s pretty easy from here—select the type of document you’re scanning 
(Text or Photo) from the drop-down menu next to the Scan button (the 
menu’s icon is a small down-arrow), and then click Scan. Your scanner will 
roar into action, and, after a short wait, you’ll be presented with a preview 
of the picture or document you placed on the scanner. You can crop and 
rotate the image by using the options in the Page menu or by right-clicking 
the preview. When you’re happy with your scan, select DocumentSave to 
finish up.
One little tip: To change the resolution of your scans, select Document
Preferences, and tweak the settings in the window that appears. Higher reso-
lutions take longer to scan and take up more disk space, but lower resolutions 
can look terrible, so choose wisely!

Not-So-Simple Scanning with XSane
Simple Scan will be able to handle most of your scanning needs, but if you have 
some particularly complex scanning that you need to do, you can use XSane. 
XSane is a real monster of a scanning program, packed full of professional 
features and fine-tuning options (see Figure 10-12). Search for and install 
XSane using the Ubuntu Software Center, and then select Applications
GraphicsXSane Image Scanner. XSane will perform a search for an attached 
scanner. If it finds one, it will start up. If it doesn’t, a window will appear 
that says “No devices available.” If this happens, click the Close button, and 
skip to “Unrecognized Scanners” on page 207.
Figure 10-12: Scanning with XSane

206
Chapter 10
To actually scan something, place your photo or document on the scanner 
bed, and click the Acquire preview button in the bottom-left corner of the 
XSane Preview window. Once the preview appears, use the selection tools to 
define the exact area you want to scan, and then choose your resolution and 
color depth settings in the main XSane window. When everything is ready, 
click the Scan button. Your scanned image will then appear in a Viewer win-
dow (as shown in Figure 10-13).
Figure 10-13: The results of your scan are displayed in a separate Viewer 
window.
In that window, you can perform some minor tweaks of the scanned 
image using the buttons and menu items provided and then save the image 
by selecting FileSave image.
If you want to convert a scanned document into a text file, you’ll first 
have to install the Gocr package using the Ubuntu Software Center. Gocr 
performs a process called optical character recognition, which tries to figure out 
what text the image contains by recognizing the shapes of individual letters. 
(It only works for typed text, not handwriting.)
Once Gocr is installed, scan your document into XSane as before. This 
time, click the second button from the left (the one that says ABCDEF) before 
you click Save image, and you will find that you can save the file as a text doc-
ument now as well. The text recognition isn’t perfect, so make sure you go 
over the text file to look for typos afterward.
XSane has plenty more tricks up its sleeve—visit http://www.xsane.org/
doc/sane-xsane-doc.html/ for information on what features are available and 
how to use them.

Unrecognized Scanners
If you receive a message telling you that no scanners were detected when you 
open a scanning program, your scanner may not have been recognized prop-
erly by Ubuntu. Here are a few things you can try to work around this:
z
Install the libsane-extras package using the Ubuntu Software Center. This 
contains a handful of scanner drivers that aren’t installed by default. Once 
it’s installed, try opening your scanning program again to see whether it 
worked.
z
Press ALT-F2 to open the Run Application window; then type gksudo simple-
scan, and click Run, entering your password if prompted. This will start 
Simple Scan with root (administrator) privileges, a step that sometimes 
manages to raise the scanner from its slumber.
z
If you still have no luck, check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hardware
SupportComponentsScanners/ to see whether there are any special instruc-
tions that you need to follow, or ask for advice on the Ubuntu forums 
(http://www.ubuntuforums.org/).
Why Are My Scanned Images So Big?
To wrap up this section on scanning, let me address a question that seems to 
confuse a lot of people: Why does a scanned image on the computer screen 
seem so much bigger than its real-life counterpart? One of the first areas of 
confusion is that there is a general blurring of how the terms pixels per inch 
(ppi) and dots per inch (dpi) are used. Most applications use these terms inter-
changeably, and yet they aren’t really the same thing. To make things simple, 
when you are talking about images on your screen, you are talking about pixels 
(the little squares that make up your screen image) per inch, and when you 
are talking about printer resolution, you are talking about dots (of printer ink) 
per inch.
Your computer screen generally has a resolution of 96ppi, while most 
modern inkjet and laser printers have a resolution range of 300 to 1200dpi, 
or sometimes even more. This means that a photo scanned at 96ppi, which 
looks just fine on your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it. 
On the other hand, when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will look 
much better in your printout but will be gigantic if you display it “full size” on 
your screen. This is because there will be three times as many pixels per inch, 
so it looks three times bigger onscreen.
As an example, look at Figure 10-14, where you can see an identical image 
scanned at three different resolutions: 96ppi, 150ppi, and 300ppi. As you can 
see, the 96ppi image at the far left (measuring 5 by 6 inches—about the size 
of the hard copy itself) is the smallest, while the other two images are propor-
tionally bigger (about 10 by 12 inches for the 150ppi image and about 22 by 
25 inches for the 300ppi image).

208
Chapter 10
Figure 10-14: The same image scanned at three different resolutions
Which Resolution Should I Use When Scanning?
Which resolution you use when scanning depends on a variety of factors, the 
most important of which is what you plan to do with the image when you’re 
finished. When I look at Figure 10-14 on my computer screen, the smallest 
image looks best, the middle image looks OK, and the largest looks a bit odd, 
not as sharp as the other two. Basically, when scanning images for display on 
a computer—on web pages, for instance—it is probably best to stick with a 
ppi similar to typical screen resolutions or slightly larger: 96 to 150ppi.
When it comes to printing, a whole new set of considerations comes into 
play. First, there are the limitations of your scanner, since different models 
have different maximum resolutions. The resolution limits of your printer 
are also, naturally enough, a major consideration. For example, laser printers 
and inkjet printers have different characteristics; laser printers will generally 
produce better-quality images than inkjet printers, while inkjet output will be 
more greatly affected by the type of paper used than a laser printer will be. 
Of course, your printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images 
at higher resolutions than those at which you plan to print them, but you will 
end up with a lot of files taking up too much disk space. Remember, the higher 
the resolution of a scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk space. If this 
is of concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you’re done printing 
using an application such as the GIMP (more on that in Chapter 13), but if 
you would prefer not being so cavalier with your use of disk space from the 
get-go, you can follow these very general guidelines:
z
If you are using a laser printer, scan at the same resolution at which you 
are going to print.
z
If you are going to use an inkjet printer with photo-quality paper, scan at 
about 80 percent of your target printout resolution—about 240ppi for a 
300dpi printout.

Gutenbird
209
z
If you are using an inkjet printer with regular paper, scan at about 65 
percent of your target printout resolution—about 195ppi for a 300dpi 
printout.
Needless to say, these are just suggestions to get you started. What works 
best for you and your particular scanner/printer setup may be slightly differ-
ent. Nothing works better than a bit of experimentation and trial and error. 
In this case, you can’t really go wrong. Just give yourself some time, don’t get 
frustrated, and, most importantly, don’t wait until you desperately need to 
scan something before trying things—stay ahead of the game.

Linux Speaks Your Language
These days, almost all operating systems 
are multilingual, or at least capable of 
becoming so. This is true of Linux as well. 
Just open your web browser and, without per-
forming any special installations, you can read pages in 
any European language, including those with Cyrillic 
alphabets, such as Russian. You can even view pages in 
Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Arabic, and Hebrew, to name 
but a few.
But the multilingual capabilities of Linux are much greater than this, 
and the way that it handles multilingual matters makes it quite easy to take 
advantage of these capabilities. As you will soon see, you can even set up your 
system to give you a totally foreign language environment, allowing you to 

212
Chapter 11
function completely in the language of your choice. Add to this the ever-
expanding number of free programs available for language study, and you 
have a truly meaningful language-learning tool.
Read-Only Language Support
If all you want is to be able to read web pages or documents written in a foreign 
language, you don’t need to install any additional language support except 
in some rare cases. From the get-go, you will be able to view documents in just 
about any language you happen to throw at your system—it doesn’t matter if 
it’s Swedish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Vietnam-
ese, Armenian, or Thai. You will be able to read whatever you are linguisti-
cally capable of reading (see Figure 11-1 for an example).
Figure 11-1: A Japanese web page displayed in Firefox
Firefox usually automatically recognizes the language in which a web 
page is written and thus displays the page correctly. Sometimes, however, the 
author of the page may neglect to include the character coding for that page 
in the HTML, in which case Firefox, not knowing that the page is prepared 
in another language, will very often open it in the default language of your 
system. The result is a page in which you see nothing but odd combinations 
of symbols and letters that have no meaning. In this case, try changing the 
character coding in Firefox to the language encoding you believe the page 
to be in. Some languages employ more than one encoding scheme, so if 
you’re not sure, give each one a try. You can make your choices by going to 
the Firefox View menu and selecting Character Encoding. From the submenu 
there, you can select the appropriate coding for the language of that page.

Typing Nonstandard Characters
Typing characters that are not standard in English, such as é, ç, ß, ø, æ, and å, 
can be done quite easily in Linux without any modifications. In most situations, 
you can do this by using the Character Map utility included in your system, 
which can be found at ApplicationsAccessoriesCharacter Map. Upon run-
ning Character Map, a window like the one shown in Figure 11-2 will appear.
Figure 11-2: Inputting characters with the Character Map utility
To input the character you want, just select the language or character set 
in the left pane of the window, and then, in the right pane, double-click the 
character you want to input. The character will appear in the little input box 
next to the words Text to copy at the bottom of the window. Just click the Copy 
button, and then paste the character wherever you want to place it.
OpenOffice.org offers a method of its own that you can use. Click Insert 
in the menu bar, and then select Special Character. A selection window will 
open, and you can select the character you want there. Once you’ve done 
that, click the OK button, and the character will appear in your document, 
after which the selection window will close by itself. Double-clicking the char-
acter you want will also accomplish the same thing.
Using the Compose Key Option
If you need to type an accent or umlaut only once in a while and don’t feel 
particularly keen on opening an application or going to a special menu to do 
so, using the compose key option for your keyboard is a good way to go. Basically 
this means you use one of the lesser-used keys on your keyboard in conjunc-
tion with six symbols (` , ' ~ " ^) to help in the creation, so to speak, of accented 
characters.

214
Chapter 11
Before you can use this feature, you have to select which key you want 
to use as your compose key. For this example, I’ll use the right ALT key, since 
most people don’t use it much. Here’s what you need to do: 
1.
Go to the System menu, and select PreferencesKeyboard.
2.
In the Keyboard Preferences window that appears, click the Layouts tab, 
and then click the Options button.
3.
In the Keyboard Layout Options window, click the + button next to the 
words Compose key position.
4.
Check the box next to the key you want to use as your compose key 
(Figure 11-3). Then close the Keyboard Layout Options window and 
the Keyboard Preferences window.
Figure 11-3: Selecting your compose key
Once you’ve done that, you can use your compose key to type those char-
acters. Let’s say, for example, that you wanted to type an umlauted u (that is, ü). 
While pressing the right ALT key (or whatever key you selected as your compose 
key), you would press ". Then you would release the right ALT key, press u, 
and voilà—you’d have yourself an ü! Here are some more examples:
á
right ALT + ' then a
ç
right ALT + , then c
è
right ALT + ` then e
ñ
right ALT + ~ then n
ô

NOTE
These sequences are based on U.S. keyboard layouts. Combinations for other layouts 
may differ.
Adding Keyboard Layouts
If you often type in a particular foreign language, it might be more convenient 
for you to add a whole new keyboard layout for the language or languages 
you use. For example, if you often type in Swedish and thus use the characters 
å, ä, and ö regularly, using the appropriate keyboard layout would be easier 
than repeatedly using the Character Map. This is even more true if you type 
in Greek, Russian, Serbian, Georgian, or any other language that uses a com-
pletely different alphabet. Of course, you will have to familiarize yourself with 
the keyboard layout, or keymap, for each language you choose, but this is a 
relatively easy task.
To add foreign language keyboard layouts to your system’s repertoire, 
here’s all you need to do:
1.
Select SystemPreferencesKeyboard.
2.
In the Keyboard Preferences window, click the Layouts tab.
3.
Once in the Layouts tab, click the Add button.
4.
In the Choose a Layout window that then appears, select the keyboard 
layout you want to add, and when done, click Add (Figure 11-4).
5.
Repeat Steps 3–4 to add other layouts (up to a maximum of four layouts).
6.
When done, your window should look something like Figure 11-5 but 
with slightly different keyboard layout selections. Click Close to complete 
the process.
Figure 11-4: Selecting and viewing foreign-language keymaps

216
Chapter 11
Figure 11-5: Viewing the active keyboard layouts on your system
After closing the Keyboard Preferences window, a keyboard layout indi-
cator will appear in the upper-right corner of the top panel. The letters USA 
or GBr will appear, indicating that you are currently using your English lan-
guage keymap. If you click that indicator, you will toggle between any of the 
other layouts you’ve activated. If you are not sure where the keys are located 
in your current keymap, you can get some help by right-clicking the indica-
tor and selecting Show Current Layout in the drop-down menu, after which a 
map of the new layout will appear in a separate window. The keymap shown 
in that window can be rather hard to make out, so you will probably need to 
expand the window by dragging it by one of its bottom corners. You can also 
print a copy of the layout from this window by clicking the Print button.
If you just want to choose a single keyboard layout to replace your current 
one (such as British English instead of American English or German instead 
of Spanish), you can do so from the Keyboard Preferences window. Simply 
add the keyboard layout you want to use, and remove any additional layouts 
by clicking each one and then clicking the Remove button.
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Input
For most European languages (and many other alphabet-based non-European 
languages), pressing a letter on the keyboard simply prints that letter to the 
screen. However, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean require a kind of conversion 
process that is handled by a special application (actually a set of applications) 

Polyglot Penguins
217
called an input method editor (IME). Each of these languages has its own IME, 
and each is quite different because of the basic differences in the three writ-
ing systems.
Chinese
Although most people (at least those in the linguistic know) would think that 
Chinese would be the most complicated system, because the writing system 
consists of thousands of characters, it is in fact the simplest. The Chinese 
IME simply takes the Romanized keyboard input, known as pinyin, and converts 
it into Chinese characters, or Hanzi. For the IME, it is essentially a simple 
dictionary lookup task—big dictionary, simple IME. In the event that there is 
more than one character for the pinyin input, a list of possible candidates 
will appear, and the user can then simply select the appropriate character 
from that list. More recent Chinese IMEs also have predictive capabilities, by 
which they judge what you are trying to type on the basis of what you’ve typed 
so far (Figure 11-6). Although these more “intelligent” IMEs can be a bit 
squirrelly to use at first, they prove to be rather handy once you get the hang 
of things.
Figure 11-6: Chinese IMEs can predict 
what you’re going to write . . . kind of.
Japanese
The Japanese IME has a considerably more complicated task to perform, 
because it has three writing systems to deal with: Kanji (ideographic characters 
borrowed long ago from China), hiragana (the phono-alphabetic system used 
mainly for tense and case endings), and katakana (used mainly for words bor-
rowed from other languages). Still, the standard input method for Japanese 
is primarily via the standard Roman keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-
function keys. Thus, typing in Japanese is a two-step process whereby the IME 
first converts the romanized text into hiragana as it is typed and then converts 
it to appropriate Kanji, katakana, or hiragana elements after the spacebar is 
pressed.
You can see an example of these steps in Figure 11-7. In the first line, the 
IME has already converted the Romanized input on the fly. It has converted 
rinakkusdenihongonyuuryokugamodekimasu (which means You can input Japanese 

218
Chapter 11
in Linux) to hiragana. When a line of hiragana is highlighted, it means that 
the line has not yet been converted beyond that. In the second line, how-
ever, the user has subsequently pressed the spacebar, which caused the IME 
to convert the hiragana string into the appropriate Kanji, hiragana, and kata-
kana elements. The first word, Linux, has been converted to katakana text, 
because it is a borrowed word, while Japanese input has been converted to 
Kanji; the rest stays in hiragana.
Figure 11-7: IME conversions while typing in Japanese
Korean
The job of the Korean IME is again quite different from that of the Chinese 
and Japanese IMEs, because the language is written in a very different way. 
Korean is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called Hangul, or in a 
combination of Hangul and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese 
called Hanja. While the Hanja characters are essentially the same as their 
Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Hanzi and Kanji, the Korean phonetic 
alphabet, Hangul, has it own unique appearance, as you can see in the Korean 
word for Korea, Hangug(k), in Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-8: Korea (Hangug) written horizontally in Hangul 
This seems simple; however, the representation is not quite correct, because 
Korean is very unique in the way that its alphabetic characters are put to the 
page. Unlike the usual side-by-side positioning of hiragana, katakana, and 
most other languages written with an alphabet, Hangul letters are grouped 
in pairs, triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a general rule, 
clockwise. The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually based on a Korean 
alphabetical keyboard layout) while it is being typed, and it must adjust the 
size, spacing, and positioning of each of the letters as it puts them into appro-
priate clusters (see Figure 11-9).

So, what do you do if, for example, you want to be able to type Chinese, Japa-
nese, Korean, Hindi, Thai, or Nepali while still in your usual English environ-
ment? What if you want to be able to type all of those languages in the same 
document? Can you do it?
You bet.
There are actually several ways of going about this, but the default method 
in Ubuntu is the easy-to-use Intelligent Input Bus (IBus). IBus supports most 
Asian languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it provides a 
number of input methods for many of these.
11-1: Selecting Input Method Modules
The first thing you will need to do to use IBus is select the appropriate input 
modules for the language(s) you want to input. To do this, go to the System 
menu, and select PreferencesIBus Preferences. A window will then appear 
asking you whether you would like to start the IBus daemon. Click Yes, after 
which yet another window may appear telling you what to do if you cannot 
get IBus to work. Click OK in that window. (Fortunately, these two windows 
will appear only when you first start IBus.) The IBus Preferences window will 
then appear. Click the Input Method tab.
NOTE
A daemon is a program that runs in the background, unbeknownst to the average 
user, providing a system with added functionality. In the case of IBus, that added 
functionality is the ability to input complex character sets.
On that tab, click the Select an input method drop-down button, select 
the input method you require, and then click Add. The input method you 
just added will then appear in the main pane of the window beneath the 
default method, English. Repeat the process for any other input methods 
you want to add. When done, your window should look like a variation on 
what you see in Figure 11-10, depending on which languages you actually 
select. When you’re done making your selection, click the Close button.

Figure 11-10: Selecting complex character input methods in IBus
As you will notice when selecting input methods, some languages, such as 
Chinese, have a number of methods to choose from (as shown in Figure 11-11). 
To give you some quick help, I will suggest appropriate choices for the student 
or casual user of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
z
For simplified Chinese standard pinyin input support, select Chinese – py.
z
For traditional Chinese zhuyin/Bopomofo input support, select Chinese 
– bopomofo.
z
For Japanese input support, select Japanese – anthy.
z
For Korean input based on the standard English keyboard, select Korean 
– romaja.
For those studying or teaching Chinese, you might also want to select 
Chinese – pinyin, which allows you to easily type the Chinese words in Roman 
letters with tone markings, as shown in Figure 11-12. Just type each character 
phonetically in pinyin followed by the character’s tone number (type zhong1 
guo2 for China, for example), and then the diacritic tone markings will appear 
above the Romanized output. Very handy.

to choose from.
Figure 11-12: IBus lets you easily show pinyin character readings 
with tone markings.
11-2: Typing Asian Languages with IBus
Once you have chosen your input methods and closed the IBus Preferences 
window, a small icon that looks like a mini keyboard will appear to the right 
of the volume controller in the top panel. If you click that panel, you will see 
all the available input methods listed in the drop-down menu that appears 

222
Chapter 11
(as shown in Figure 11-13). To put this menu to use, you’ll need to open an 
application that allows text input. To try things, let’s use gedit (Applications
Accessoriesgedit Text Editor).
Figure 11-13: Accessing language input methods 
from the IBus Panel applet
Once gedit appears, select the input method you want to use from the 
IBus panel applet. An input palette for the language you’ve selected will 
appear in the bottom-right corner of your desktop (Figure 11-14). You can 
now start typing in gedit using the input method you’ve selected.
Figure 11-14: The IBus input palette
To switch from one input method to another, there are three options. 
First, you can go to the IBus Panel applet and change methods from the 
menu options. Second, you can make the change from the input palette: 
Clicking the name of the current input method will reveal a menu from which 
you can choose an alternative method (Figure 11-15). Finally, you can switch 
between methods with hotkey combinations: CTRL-spacebar toggles IBus on 
and off, while ALT-SHIFT-L switches you from one input method to the next.

from the IBus input palette

223
Setting Up IBus to Automatically Start Up When You Log In
As you probably recall from when you first opened the IBus Preferences win-
dow, you have to start up IBus each time you log into your system. If you use 
IBus a lot and would thus prefer forgoing this extra step, you can easily set up 
your system to start it automatically when you log in. All you have to do is 
select SystemAdministrationLanguage Support.
In the Language tab, select ibus in the drop-down menu button next to 
the words Keyboard input method system, as shown in Figure 11-16. When done, 
close the window. The next time you log in, IBus will automatically start up 
and be ready for action when you need to use it.
Figure 11-16: Setting up your system so that IBus automatically starts 
at login
If IBus still does not start up automatically the next time you log in, 
try adding it to your system’s list of startup applications. To do this, select 
PreferencesStartup Applications, and in the Startup Applications Prefer-
ences window, click the Add button. In the Name box type Ibus, and in the 
Command box type /usr/bin/ibus-daemon -d. When done, click Add, and 
then close the Startup Applications Preferences window.
Viewing Your System in Another Language
One of the many things that originally attracted me to the Linux world was 
being able to install language support for languages other than English and 
come up with a whole new system in a different language. On one of my 
machines, I have installed support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and my 
default, English. With just a simple logout and a few more clicks, I can log 
back in with an interface in a totally different language. I can have a Chinese, 
Japanese, or Swedish system whenever I want.

224
Chapter 11
This is very useful if you’re in an environment where not everyone shares 
the same native language. At my former university, for example, where my 
Japanese and Chinese students sometimes used my computer, the additional 
language support allowed them to log in using their own language. It’s even 
pretty handy if you are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself 
as much exposure as possible to it. All in all, it is a very useful feature.
Taking advantage of this feature in the GNOME environment is very easy. 
Basically all you have to do is install a group of support files for each language 
you want to add to your system. You can do this by going to the System
AdministrationLanguage Support, after which the Language window will 
appear. In that window, click the Install/Remove Languages button. In the 
Installed Languages window that then appears, choose from the various lan-
guages available by checking the appropriate boxes. If you are installing 
language support for languages with complex writing systems, such as Japanese, 
be sure to also check the boxes next to the words Input methods and Extra fonts 
(Figure 11-17).
Once you have made your selections, click the Apply Changes button. You 
will be prompted for your password at this point, so provide what is required, 
and the Language Support tool will begin downloading and then installing 
the support packages you specified. Once it is done, you will be notified and 
left with the Language window.
Figure 11-17: Selecting additional languages to install
Once you have installed support for the additional languages you want, 
you can choose to have your system open in a different language environ-
ment by using the Language window (SystemAdministrationLanguage 
Support). In the language tab of that window, select the language you want 
to use when you next log in, and drag it to the top of the list (Figure 11-18). 
For languages with complex input systems, you can also select your input 
method of choice, such as IBus, in the menu button next to the words Keyboard 
input method system. You can then close the window, log out, and then log in 
again, after which your system will appear in the language you chose.

Figure 11-18: Selecting the language in which you want your 
system to appear when you next log in
If you prefer, you can instead make these login choices from the login 
screen. Once you click your name in the list of users, a set of menus will appear 
in a panel at the bottom of the screen. Choose the language you want to use 
from the Language menu in that panel. If the language you want is not there 
and you know that you installed it, select Other, and then select the language 
you are looking for in the window that appears. Once done, click OK, and 
then proceed to log in normally.
Your startup process will then continue, and everything will progress as it 
usually does. Depending on what language you’ve chosen, once your desktop 
appears you will be in another linguistic world. Your menus, applications, 
and even the little tips windows that pop up when you run your mouse over a 
panel icon will all be in the newly selected language (Figure 11-19).

Getting Down to Business in Linux
I have to admit it, when I think about the 
joys of computing, I tend to think of the 
more hedonistic, self-indulgent areas like 
gaming, music, and graphics. Still, as is the 
case for most computer users, what I usually end up 
doing on my computer is work, and writing this book 
falls into that category.
Fortunately, Linux can get down to business and do it as well as the next 
OS. I think it’s safe to say that you are missing nothing and are probably gain-
ing quite a bit in terms of home and office productivity programs in the world 
of Linux. In this chapter, I’ll walk you through the Linux offerings in this 
department.
OpenOffice.org
Whether they should be or not, people are quite obsessed with office suites, 
even though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The de 
facto standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in 

228
Chapter 12
both the Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, because it is a Microsoft 
product, you can be quite sure that no Linux version is available. 
Fortunately, Linux does have an exceedingly capable office suite in the 
form of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in 
free) in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some light-
weight sour-grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a 
full-featured contender, and in some cases, OpenOffice.org is a clear winner.
OpenOffice.org Applications
The entire OpenOffice.org office suite consists of a number of application 
modules, and the most commonly used ones come bundled with Ubuntu. 
These include a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), and a presen-
tation creator and player (Impress), all of which you can find by selecting 
ApplicationsOffice. In addition, there is a very handy vector drawing program 
(Draw), which you’ll find by selecting ApplicationsGraphics. The database 
module (Base) and the mathematical formula editor (Math), though no 
longer packaged with Ubuntu, are still available as separate downloads via 
Ubuntu Software Center (by searching for and marking openoffice.org-base and 
openoffice.org-math, respectively).
Since giving full and detailed instructions on how to use each of these 
applications would take up an entire book (and there are entire books on 
the subject), I will simply introduce each module to you.
Writer
As I mentioned earlier, the word processor is the office application that the 
majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, OpenOffice.org Writer is 
a good one (see Figure 12-1). It is chock-full of features and can read and 
save Microsoft Word files. Like Word, it will even let you save your docu-
ments as HTML files so that you can easily change your documents into 
web pages.
As I said, Writer is a very straightforward word processor, so I won’t go on 
about it, but if you would like an introduction to using Writer (or the other 
OpenOffice.org modules), check out the various tutorials and other resources 
available at http://support.openoffice.org/.
Calc
Calc is the OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application, and it is similar to Excel 
in terms of capabilities and general layout (see Figure 12-2). It can also, quite 
importantly, read and save Microsoft Excel files.
Since most people who use spreadsheets generally understand what they 
are all about and, after a bit of poking around, can figure out how to use 
them, I won’t go into any sort of primer about using Calc. However, because 
there are many others who don’t see any need to even try using spreadsheets, 
I will mention a few of the simpler tasks that can be done with Calc, in the 
hope of enticing some of you into trying it.

Figure 12-2: A graph created in OpenOffice.org Calc

230
Chapter 12
Most people who don’t use spreadsheets think of them as sort of giant 
calculators used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, such as 
payrolls (which was the original purpose of such applications). That’s right, 
of course, but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too, such as pro-
jecting household budgets, calculating grade point averages (by teachers or 
students), figuring out how long it will take you to save up for your trip to 
Hungary, or even comparing the seat heights for the four or five motorcycles 
you are trying to choose among. And when doing any of these minor mathe-
matical tasks, you can easily create graphs in order to make all the abstract 
numbers speak to you visually.
If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating 
lists of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, address 
lists . . . whatever. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical 
order, sort them by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to 
find some use for Calc, so don’t ignore it entirely.
And if you are still not convinced that Calc has a place in your life, you 
might at least find some amusement from an Easter egg hidden within the 
program, which allows you to play a Space Invaders clone called Star-Wars 
(Figure 12-3). Just type =GAME("StarWars") into any cell in Calc, and press ENTER. 
The instructions are in German, but it should be easy enough to figure out 
how to play even if you don’t remember any of your high-school Deutsch. 
Figure 12-3: Space Invaders in OpenOffice.org Calc? Yup.

Impress
Impress is OpenOffice.org’s answer to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, with which it 
is compatible. It allows you to create attractive slides for use in presentations 
and also allows you to create notes or handouts to accompany them. Although 
these features make Impress quite handy in business and education settings, 
you may not find as much value in it as a home user. 
Draw
More useful to the home user is OpenOffice.org Draw. Although Draw isn’t 
great for creating true graphics in the artistic sense, it is very useful for creating 
flowcharts, organizational diagrams (such as seating arrangements for wedding 
receptions or conferences), or any other document in which you want a bit 
more control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the 
two are combined), such as fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this 
sense, Draw can be used quite effectively as a simple page layout program, 
as you can see in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4: A newsletter created (and displayed) in OpenOffice.org Draw
Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org File Compatibility
Although I mention the point throughout this section, it is worthwhile to 
reemphasize that OpenOffice.org can read and write Microsoft Office files. 
This compatibility is quite good, though tables sometimes prove slightly 
problematic. 

232
Chapter 12
To read Microsoft Office files, all you need to do is double-click the file 
in question, and it will open in the appropriate OpenOffice.org module. When 
saving files within OpenOffice.org to use within earlier versions of Microsoft 
Office, however, you must save them into the appropriate format, because 
OpenOffice.org will otherwise save files into its native format (.odt for Writer 
documents, .ods for Calc documents, and .odp for Impress documents) by 
default, and only the most recent versions of Office can deal with these files.
To do this when saving a file, click the small + next to the words File type 
in the Save window, and select the appropriate Microsoft Office format from 
the list of available file formats that appears below—choose Microsoft Word 
97/2000/XP for a Writer document, for example.
OpenOffice.org Features
The three main applications in OpenOffice.org (Writer, Calc, and 
Impress) are quite similar to their pre–Office 2007 equivalents in Microsoft 
Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), so switching to the OpenOffice.org 
applications should be relatively easy if you were weaned on those versions 
of Microsoft Office. 
If you don’t have any experience with Microsoft Office, you should still 
find it straightforward, because the basic layout is pretty intuitive. And if you 
are lacking in the intuition department, the built-in Help files are pretty good, 
too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just like tool tips in the 
Windows and Mac worlds. (In case you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, 
tool tips are those little yellow boxes that pop up to tell you what a button or 
menu item does when you place your mouse over that button or menu item.) 
Another cool and useful help feature is What’s This, which is a more detailed 
version of the Tips system. If you select HelpWhat’s This, your cursor will 
turn into a little question mark. Move that question mark cursor over almost 
any item in the OpenOffice.org interface, and you’ll find out what it does 
rather than just what the item is called.
Despite all the straightforwardness I am speaking of, a few interface items 
will most likely be unfamiliar to you. That being the case, I will briefly discuss 
those items. I’ll be using the word processor, Writer, as I describe these things, 
so if you want to run OpenOffice.org while following along, Writer might be 
a convenient starting point for you too.
Getting to Know the Buttons
Although you should be able to figure out what most of the buttons on the 
OpenOffice.org toolbars do, a few buttons are common to all OpenOffice.org 
modules and deserve a bit more explanation.
Export to PDF
The Export to PDF button is situated to the left of the two printer buttons 
(Print and Page Preview). You can use this button to export, or save, your doc-
ument as a PDF file.

Penguins at Work
233
Hyperlink
Clicking the Hyperlink button, the button to the left of the Table button, 
opens the Hyperlink window, from which you can assign links to specified 
documents—not only to web pages but also to documents on an individual 
computer and even targets within that document. Although a hyperlink on 
a web page is something we have all come to take for granted, the idea of 
hyperlinking between text documents sounds like a pretty radical concept. It 
is, in fact, a rather old one that has been around since before you or I even 
heard of the Internet. 
Navigator
The fourth to the last button in the top row (the one that looks like a star-
burst) is the Navigator button. Clicking this button (or just pressing the F5 
key) opens the Navigator window (see Figure 12-5), which is a pretty cool 
navigational feature that comes in handy when working with lengthy or oth-
erwise complex documents. 
The Navigator allows you to easily bounce back and forth between pages 
in a document or even between elements therein, such as sections, links, and 
so on. Let’s say you have a document with lots of illustrations in it (like this 
chapter), and you want to jump directly from graphic to graphic. In this case, 
you would double-click the word Graphics in the main pane of the Navigator 
window and then click the jump buttons (the odd little buttons to the left of 
the page number selector) to begin jumping.
Figure 12-5: The Navigator window
If you are dealing with a document containing various heading levels, 
such as all of the chapters in this book, you can also use Navigator to switch 
among those levels. Say you’ve decided to add a new main heading at the last 
minute to a document you’ve been writing. You thus need to drop all of the 
headings you had before down a notch; the former main heading becoming 
a subheading, and so on. By double-clicking the word Headings, the text of all 
the headings you have listed in the document appears. You can then select a 
heading in that list and click the Demote Level button (that’s the one at the 
far right of the second row of buttons) to move it down a level.

234
Chapter 12
Gallery
To the right of the Navigator button is the Gallery button. By clicking this 
button, the Gallery, a library of graphical elements for use in your documents 
or web pages, will appear in a separate pane at the top of your document 
window (see Figure 12-6). The elements within the Gallery range from vari-
ous types of lines to buttons to colored three-dimensional doughnuts, and 
you can even add items of your own.
Figure 12-6: The Gallery
Inserting a graphic into your document is a simple enough task even 
when not using the Gallery. All you need to do is select InsertPicture
From File and then locate the image file you want to insert. It can be handier 
to use the Gallery, however, when you intend to use certain graphics frequently. 
Once in the Gallery, your graphics are always only a click or two away and can 
be conveniently viewed in the Gallery browser window. 
The collection of artwork that comes with OpenOffice.org is mostly 
geared toward building web pages, but other clip art is available elsewhere. For 
example, you can find a great collection online at http://www.openclipart.org/. 
Everything there is in the public domain, so it is all free to use. Be sure to 
check out the “Game baddie” collection—it’s one of my favorites.
Adding these (or any other) graphic files to the Gallery is relatively easy 
to do. First you have to create a new category (called a theme) for each group 
of images you want to add. To create a Gallery theme of your own, just click 
the New Theme button in the Gallery window. This will open the Properties 
of New Theme window, where you should give your theme a name. Once 
you’ve done that, click the Files tab and then the Find Files button, which 
will open the Select Path window. From there you can navigate to the folder 

Penguins at Work
235
in which you are storing your clip art, photos, or other graphics. Once you 
have found the folder, click the OK button, after which a list of all the files in 
that folder will appear in the Properties of New Theme window. 
From this window, you can easily add images to your new Gallery theme 
by clicking the name of each image you want to add (you might want to make 
sure that the box next to the word Preview is checked to make things a bit 
easier) and then clicking the Add button. Once you have done that, a copy 
of the image will immediately appear in the Gallery browser in your theme, 
where it will remain for future use (Figure 12-7). When you are done adding 
images to your new theme, click the OK button, after which the Properties of 
New Theme window will close, revealing your new theme and its contents. To 
use one of the images in the Gallery, just right-click the image you want to 
insert into your document, choose Insert, and then select Copy or Link in 
the pop-up menu.
If you’re more of a convenience-oriented type, you will be happy to know 
that you can use the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install a sig-
nificant portion of the clipart available from http://www.openclipart.org/. Just 
search for and install openclipart-openoffice.org. After the somewhat lengthy 
download and installation process is complete, restart OpenOffice.org (if it 
is running), and click the Gallery button. Your new collection will all be 
there!
Figure 12-7: Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery
Styles and Formatting
The final stop on our tour through OpenOffice.org’s unfamiliar buttons is the 
Styles and Formatting button, which is located at the far left side of the second 
row of buttons. This button acts as a toggle for the Styles and Formatting window 
(Figure 12-8), from which you can select and then apply styles to any of the 

236
Chapter 12
various elements within your document. Oh, and if you just can’t take your 
hands off the keyboard for a moment to fiddle with the mouse, you can also 
open the window by pressing the F11 key.
Figure 12-8: The Styles and Formatting window
To give you an example of how convenient using styles can be, imagine 
that you are typing a bibliography page for some document you’ve prepared. 
You typed each entry as you might any paragraph, as in the following:
Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech 
between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. The 
Journal of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes, 
20 (2), 125-147.
Like most paragraphs you type, the entry is formatted as a first-line indent, 
which is fine and dandy except that you want a hanging indent, which is the 
norm for bibliography entries. Rather than messing around with tabs or 
margins to get things the way you want, all you have to do is click your mouse 
anywhere within the paragraph and then double-click the Hanging indent 
entry in the Styles and Formatting window. After that, as if by magic (though 
you know better), the transformation is made:
Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech between non-
human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. The Journal of the 
Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes, 20 (2), 125-147.

Penguins at Work
237
You could follow the same procedure for each of your other entries or, 
with Hanging indent selected, click the paint can button in the Styles and 
Formatting window, after which your mouse cursor, when placed over the 
document, will appear as a paint can. Click in any other paragraph in your 
bibliography, and that entry, too, will be formatted in the new style. The 
process is essentially the same when applying different styles to any other 
document elements.
One thing that might annoy you when using the Styles and Formatting 
window is that it can be a pain at times, floating around as it does. It has a 
tendency to get in the way of your text no matter where you put it. Sure, you 
can toggle it on and off, but if you’re using it a number of times within the 
same document, this can be get old too.
A happy compromise is to dock the Styles and Formatting window into 
the main document window. You can do this by dragging the Styles and For-
matting window to the top-left or top-right corner of the document work area. 
When an outline of the Styles and Formatting window appears around the in-
document portion of the window (as you can see in Figure 12-9), release the 
mouse button. The Styles and Formatting window will now appear as a pane 
on the side of the document window (Figure 12-10).

Word Processing Done Lightly with AbiWord
If OpenOffice.org’s Writer is a bit more powerful than what you need for 
your everyday word processing chores and you would prefer something that 
pops up as soon as you click the launcher, then you might want to consider 
giving another word processor, AbiWord, a try (Figure 12-11). 
Figure 12-11: The other Linux word processor—AbiWord

239
AbiWord has a very straightforward and easy-to-use interface, which you 
should be able to figure out without much, if any, help. It also has a couple of 
rather interesting features, such as its autoresize function, which magnifies 
the onscreen document size (fonts, images, and everything) or shrinks it as 
you increase or decrease the size of the program window. And in case you’re 
wondering, AbiWord can save and read Microsoft Word DOC files and save 
documents as PDF files.
You can easily install AbiWord via the Ubuntu Software Center by per-
forming a search for abiword. Once you have AbiWord installed, you can run 
it by selecting ApplicationsOfficeAbiWord.
Some Other Cool Productivity Apps
In addition to the more traditional office applications, a number of other 
applications are either included with or available for your system that can 
be grouped together under the “productivity” label. I will introduce a few of 
those to you here.
Sticky Notes
Mac users will be well familiar with the digital version of the now ubiquitous 
little yellow Post-it-like notes called Sticky Notes (Figure 12-12) that come as 
part of the GNOME desktop. GNOME’s Sticky Notes is a panel applet that 
you can add to your own panel by right-clicking any open panel space and 
then selecting Add to Panel in the pop-up menu that appears. When the Add 
to Panel window appears, click Sticky Notes, and then click the Add button. 
Close the Add to Panel window by clicking Close. You will then be ready for 
note-taking action.
Figure 12-12: GNOME’s Sticky Notes

240
Chapter 12
Tomboy
If Sticky Notes just doesn’t cut it for you and your more dramatic note-taking 
needs, then perhaps you will find yourself better served by another applica-
tion that comes with your system, called Tomboy (Figure 12-13). Like Sticky 
Notes, Tomboy also works as a panel applet, but it is a bit more full featured, 
albeit without making any claims to stickiness. Instead, the various notes you 
create can be viewed by selecting them from the menu that appears when 
you click the Tomboy panel applet. All in all, it’s a very handy approach.
What really gives Tomboy its bragging rights, however, is its search and 
hyperlink functions. These allow you to search for entries within your entire 
Tomboy note library and create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to 
another linked note. In fact, Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink 
whenever you type a word that matches one of your existing note headings. 
To make matters even more exciting (or at least more useful), Tomboy, by 
means of its plug-ins feature, allows you to export notes to HTML or print 
them, either as hard copy or as PDF docs. 
If you’d like to try Tomboy, start it by selecting ApplicationsAccessories
Tomboy Notes, after which Tomboy will appear in the top GNOME panel.
Figure 12-13: Notes taken seriously—Tomboy
GnuCash
If you are familiar with the personal financial management software Quicken, 
then you might be interested in GnuCash, which is the Linux world’s best-
known offering in the personal finance arena. It reads Quicken and Intuit 
QIF files, which makes things even nicer should you be making the transition 
from another operating system. Unfortunately, unless you live in Germany, 
you cannot use GnuCash for online banking. But as the GnuCash folks them-
selves say, don’t blame them; blame your bank.

Penguins at Work
241
To install GnuCash, just do an Ubuntu Software Center search for gnucash, 
and then install both gnucash and gnucash-docs. Once these are installed, 
you can run the application by selecting ApplicationsOfficeGnuCash 
Finance Management.
Scribus
To round things out, we come to a open source desktop publishing applica-
tion, Scribus (Figure 12-14), for those times when OpenOffice.org Writer 
and Draw just don’t cut it. Scribus is designed to produce commercial-grade 
output, with support for professional publishing features, such as CMYK colors, 
PostScript handling, and creation of color separations, to name but a few. 
Figure 12-14: Scribus
You can download and install Scribus by doing an Ubuntu Software Cen-
ter search for scribus. Once the installation is complete, you can run the 
application by selecting ApplicationsGraphicsScribus.

Linux Does Art
Now that you know you can get down to 
business in Linux, it is time to don that beret 
of yours and address the artistic side of things. 
Yes, Linux does art, and as you will soon find 
out, a good number of programs on your system allow 
you to create and manipulate graphic files. These days, 
however, there is perhaps nothing as important to most 
users’ graphical repertoires as their digital cameras, so 
that is where we’ll begin. 

244
Chapter 13
Although scanner support for Linux can prove a bit spotty, support for digital 
cameras is practically a worry-free affair. In fact, if Ubuntu can’t figure out 
what kind of camera you have, it just treats it as if it were an external hard 
drive or flash drive plugged into your computer’s USB port. And even if your 
camera doesn’t seem to communicate with your computer when connected 
directly, you can still transfer your images to your hard disk by removing the 
memory card from your camera, inserting it into a USB flash memory card 
reader, and plugging that reader into one of your computer’s USB ports. In 
that case, your system will mount the card reader as if it were an external 
drive (which is pretty much what it is), thus allowing you to copy the images 
to your hard disk. Of course, you can use this method even if your camera 
works just fine with Ubuntu—some people find it to be the easiest way to deal 
with things, anyway.
13A-1: Importing Images from Camera to Computer Somewhat Automatically 
via F-Spot
When you connect your camera to your computer via a USB cable, put your 
camera in play mode, and power it on, Ubuntu will usually automatically rec-
ognize it and open a window that asks how you want to import the photos on 
the camera. To import the photos via F-Spot, accept the default selection in 
the drop-down menu button, Open F-Spot (as shown in Figure 13-1), and 
then click OK. After that, here’s what you need to do:
1.
In the window that appears, you will see thumbnails and filenames of 
all the photos on your camera. By default, all the images are selected. 
However, if you prefer to copy only some of the images, you can do so by 
holding down the CTRL key and clicking the desired images, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
2.
Once you’ve made your selections, click the Target location button, and 
choose where to copy your photos. Your Pictures folder, or a subfolder 
within it, might be a logical spot. 
3.
You can also tag the photos you are about to import by checking the 
Attach tag box and then selecting the desired tag from the menu button 
to the right. I’ll talk more about tagging in Project 13B-2.
4.
Finally, click the Copy button.

F-Spot will then begin the copying process, showing its progress in a 
separate window. When the download is complete, the words Download 
Complete will appear within the progress bar of that window. Click the OK 
button. You can now view your images within the main F-Spot window 
(Figure 13-3).

Figure 13-3: Viewing your imported digital camera images in F-Spot
13A-2: Transferring Images from Camera to Computer via Nautilus
As I mentioned, you can also use Nautilus to import photos from your cam-
era. The process for doing this starts pretty much the same as I discussed in 
Project 13A-1, albeit with a slight twist. Here’s how you do it:
1.
Plug your camera into one of your computer’s USB ports, and put your 
camera into play mode. Within seconds, a window like that in Figure 13-1 
will appear. In that window, select Open Folder in the drop-down menu 
button instead of the default F-Spot, and then click OK. A Nautilus window 
will appear revealing the contents of your camera’s storage card. An icon 
for your camera will also appear in the side pane of that window and any 
other open Nautilus window (Figure 13-4) and on your desktop as a double-
clickable launcher. 
2.
Double-click your way through the folders on your camera until you find 
the photos you want to import.
3.
Drag and drop or copy and paste the images from your camera to any 
logical spot in your home folder. 

Brush-Wielding Penguins
247
4.
When you’re done with your transfers, either click the eject icon next to 
the entry for your camera in the left pane of a Nautilus window or right-
click the icon for your camera on the desktop, and select Unmount. The 
icon for your camera will then disappear from the side pane and desk-
top. Or, easiest of all, just turn off your camera, and both the desktop 
and Nautilus instances of your camera should automatically disappear.
Figure 13-4: You can also drag and drop photos from your digital camera as if it were 
a USB drive.
F-Spot not only imports images from you camera to computer but also acts as 
a handy photo-organizing, browsing, viewing, and editing tool. And working 
in conjunction with Evolution, the default email software in Ubuntu, F-Spot 
allows you to easily send images via email (FileSend by Mail) without fiddling 
around with attachments. You can run F-Spot by selecting Applications
GraphicsF-Spot Photo Manager. Note that the first time out, you will be 
asked to select the folders that hold the images you want to import into F-Spot. 
13B-1: Exporting Images to Online Albums and Galleries
A very cool feature of F-Spot is that it allows you to export images to numerous 
online gallery or album sites, such as Flickr and Picasa, much like Windows 
Live Photo Gallery. Exporting an image to an online gallery or album is 
Project 13B: Working with Digital Images in F-Spot 
Photo Manager

248
Chapter 13
pretty simple, and I’ll use a Picasa web album for this example. Here’s what 
you need to do:
1.
Select the photos you want to place into your online album by holding 
down the CTRL key and clicking each photo once.
2.
In the main F-Spot window, select PhotoExport toPicasaWeb, after 
which an Export window like the one in Figure 13-5 will appear. 
Figure 13-5: Exporting images to online galleries via F-Spot
3.
The first time out, you will need to click the Add button at the top of the 
window (to the right of the word Gallery) to set things up so that F-Spot 
can access your online gallery. 
4.
In the small window that appears, type the username and password for 
your online album/gallery service (not your username and password 
for Ubuntu). Click Add in that window when you’re done. 
5.
You can also decide which of your online albums you want to add the 
photos to by clicking the drop-down menu in the Album section. Or, if 
you want to create a new album, click the Add button to the right of that 
menu, provide a title and description in the small window that appears, 
and then click Add.
6.
Once back in the Export window, click the Export button.
F-Spot will then start uploading your images to your online gallery site, 
letting you know what it’s doing in a progress window. Once done, your web 
browser will open to your online gallery page, revealing your newly uploaded 
images. You can toggle this post-export automatic browser opening feature 
by checking or unchecking the Open album in browser when done uploading 
box in the Export window (Figure 13-5).

13B-2: Organizing Your Photo Collections with Tags
As your photo collection grows and grows, it can get rather tough to sort 
things out and find exactly what you need. Fortunately, F-Spot has a few ways 
of making this easier to deal with, one of which is the timeline slider, located 
immediately above the thumbnail-viewing pane, which allows you to locate 
images by year and month.
An additional and interesting way of organizing things is by using tags, 
which allow you to identify images thematically. Applying tags and using such 
tags to narrow down your photo searches is pretty easy to do.
First, to apply tags to your images, just drag the appropriate tag icon 
from the left pane of the F-Spot window directly onto the image you want to 
tag. You can place more than one tag on a picture. Once you have added the 
tag, a small version of the tag icon will appear below the image, as you can 
see in Figure 13-6. 
Figure 13-6: Using F-Spot’s tags feature to help deal with hefty photo collections
The number of preset tags is rather limited, but you can add your own by 
selecting TagsCreate New Tag. 
Give your tag a name in the Create New Tag window that appears, and 
click Create. The new tag will then appear in the left pane of the F-Spot 
window, albeit without an icon. There are two ways to add an icon. One is to 

250
Chapter 13
simply the drag the iconless tag to a photo you want to tag with it, after which 
a mini-thumbnail of that image will become the icon for the tag.
The other approach is to right-click the new tag and select Edit Tag in 
the pop-up menu. In the window that appears, click the iconless button next 
to the word Icon, and then select one of the predefined icons in the window 
that appears. You can also use this approach to edit the photo of an automat-
ically created tag, which allows you to determine exactly what portion of a 
picture you want to use as the icon for that tag (Figure 13-7).
Figure 13-7: Modifying the portion of photo used as an icon tag in F-Spot
Searching for images by tag is perhaps even easier than adding the tags 
to the images in the first place. Let’s say you wanted to find all of your images 
that were tagged as Events. You would first go to the Find menu and select 
Find Selected Tag. A find bar will then appear directly above the thumbnail-
viewing area of the F-Spot window. Drag the icon for the Events tag to that 
find bar, and almost immediately images tagged as Events will appear in the 
thumbnail area below. Sweet.
Getting Arty with the GIMP
The Windows and Mac worlds may have Photoshop, but the Linux world has 
the GIMP (see Figure 13-8). Although arguably not as powerful as Photo-
shop, the GIMP is a capable contender, which may explain why it has been 
ported to both Mac and Windows. The GIMP allows you to create bitmap 
graphics and, quite importantly, retouch or completely doctor image files. 

Brush-Wielding Penguins
251
With the GIMP you can get rid of red-eye in your digital photos, airbrush out 
unwanted shadows (or even facial blemishes), give your image a canvas tex-
ture, change a photo into an oil painting, and even add a bell pepper here 
and there—with drop shadows no less. 
Figure 13-8: Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP
Because not everyone needs or uses the power of the GIMP, the powers 
that be unfortunately decided to no longer bundle it on the Ubuntu Desktop 
CD, thus freeing up space for more frequently run applications. Pity though 
that might be, you can still install the GIMP via the Ubuntu Software Center. 
Just do a search for GIMP, and then install it as you would any application, 
as you learned to do in Chapter 6. Once installed, you can run the GIMP by 
selecting ApplicationsGraphicsGIMP Image Editor.
Using the GIMP to Resize Images and Convert File Formats
Like F-Spot, the GIMP is also a very handy tool for resizing images. You can 
do this by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then 
selecting ImageScale Image in the pop-up menu. This will open the Scale 
Image window, where you can set the new size of the image.
The GIMP is also an excellent tool for converting images from one file 
format to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (.bmp) file and save 
it as a PNG (.png) file, save a JPEG (.jpg) file as a GIF (.gif) file, and so on. 

252
Chapter 13
Although this can also be done with other graphics applications, the GIMP 
supports an extremely wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save an 
image file as a compressed tarball, which makes it a true file conversion king. 
To perform a file conversion, just right-click an image opened within the 
GIMP, and then select FileSave As in the pop-up menu. You can make the 
same selection from the File menu if you prefer. Either way, the Save Image 
window will then appear. In that window, you can specify the new file format 
by replacing the original file extension in the Name box at the top of that 
window with the extension for the format you want to convert the image to. 
If you’re not sure what formats are available to you, click the small arrow to 
the left of the words Select File Type (By Extension), and then choose from the 
options in the pane that appears below. To save a work in progress, use the 
GIMP-native XCF format so that you can continue working on the image later.
Learning More
It is lots of fun to learn to use the GIMP by just playing around with it for a 
while. To get you started, most of the fun stuff is located in the Filters menu 
of any image window. Of course, you should make a backup copy of any file 
you are planning to experiment with before altering it. 
If you prefer working through manuals and tutorials over just learning 
by goofing around, you can download and install the GIMP User Manual via 
the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for gimp-help-en and then installing 
Documentation for the GIMP (English). Once it is installed, you can access 
the manual from within the GIMP from the Help menu. You can also view the 
manual online at http://docs.gimp.org/en/, and you can find a series of tutorials 
at http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/.
Phatch Photo Batch Processor
While the GIMP and F-Spot are quite capable in terms of handling the vast 
majority of your photo-organizing and editing chores, they lack an easy-to-use 
batch file conversion method that allows you to apply various conversions to a 
group of files at the same time. For example, let’s say you want to convert 100 
of your photos so they look like black-and-white snapshots with white borders, 
are 50 percent smaller than the originals, have a similar thematic filename, 
and are saved in .tiff rather than .jpg format. Applying all these changes one 
by one would be excruciating—fortunately, Phatch comes to the rescue! 
(See Figure 13-9.)
You can download and install Phatch via the Ubuntu Software Center 
by doing a search for phatch. Once installed, you can run it by selecting 
ApplicationsGraphicsPhatch PHoto bATCH Processor.

Figure 13-9: Batch photo file conversions with Phatch
Using Phatch
Using Phatch is easy, and actually quite a bit of hocus-pocusy fun. However, 
its interface might not be obvious for a first-time user. With that in mind, 
here is a brief rundown on how to use Phatch:
1.
Click the + button in the main Phatch window, and the Phatch actions 
window will appear.
2.
In that window, select the action (conversion) you want to apply to your 
photos, and click Add. Repeat this process for any other actions you want 
to apply. 
3.
Once you have added all the actions you want, click each action in the 
main Action List, and enter the appropriate parameters for each action 
(size, file format, size of border, output location, and so on). 
4.
If the actions are not listed in the order you want them to occur, click the 
action you want to move, and then change its position using the up and 
down arrow buttons. 
5.
Once everything is ready, save your Action List with a meaningful name 
so you can use it again if need be, and then select ToolsExecute. 

254
Chapter 13
6.
In the window that appears, click the Browse Folder button to find the 
photos you want to convert, and then click the Batch button. 
7.
Another window will then open showing you which files will be acted 
upon. Click Continue in that window. 
Phatch will then perform the conversions listed on your Action List in 
the order listed. It will show you the progress of its work, and then a small 
window will appear telling you it’s done. You can then find the new converted 
copies of your original photos in the destination folder you chose. If you 
failed to choose a destination folder, the newly created conversions should 
appear in a Phatch folder on your desktop.
gpaint
If the GIMP comes across as a bit overwhelming for you or if it seems to be 
overkill for your simpler tasks, you might want to try an application known as 
gpaint (or GNU Paint), which you can download and install via Ubuntu Soft-
ware Center (search for gpaint). As you can see in Figure 13-10, gpaint is similar 
to Windows Paint and MacPaint, and just as simple.
Figure 13-10: Art done simple—gpaint

Brush-Wielding Penguins
255
Once you have installed gpaint, you can run it by selecting Applications
GraphicsGNU Paint.
Inkscape
The GIMP, like other so-called paint programs, creates bitmap images in 
various file formats. These are images in which the location and color of 
every single pixel is recorded. The image is essentially a collection of dots, or 
pixels. The file you create is a rather hefty map of these pixels, and this map 
tells your system where everything in your image is supposed to go when it is 
displayed or printed. 
Drawing programs, on the other hand, create vector images, which are 
actually collections of mathematical formulae representing the various shapes 
in your image. This may sound rather unimportant to you, but such drawings 
have advantages in certain cases. One of these advantages is that vector image 
files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another, and per-
haps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain 
their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as 
a bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges (“the jaggies”) 
when enlarged to any extent, while the same circle in a vector image would 
remain smooth and round no matter how much you increased its size.
If you’re interested in giving a drawing program a go, then try Inkscape 
(see Figure 13-11). To download and install it, do a search in the Ubuntu 
Software Center for inkscape. Once it is installed, you can run it by selecting 
ApplicationsGraphicsInkscape.

It wouldn’t be right to dedicate a whole chapter to Linux’s graphical capabil-
ities without mentioning one of the newest entries in the Linux application 
arena—Picasa. Those of you coming from the Windows and Mac worlds are 
no doubt familiar with this very popular image-viewing, organizing, and edit-
ing application from Google, and you will no doubt be pleased to discover 
that it is available for Linux. Picasa is not an open source application, which 
may cause some Linux diehards to turn away, but it is free, feature rich, nice 
to look at, and decidedly cool (Figure 13-12). It also gives you easy access to 
various online photo blogs, photo finishers, and product providers, such as 
PhotoStamps, Shutterfly, Kodak, and even Walgreens.

Picasa is free, and getting it is relatively easy—just point your browser to http://
picasa.google.com/linux, and click the Download Picasa for Linux button. Once 
on the download page, click the appropriate download link (that would be 
the one under For Debian/Ubuntu i386 if you’re using the disc in this book).

then click OK to begin the installation. When the installation process is com-
plete, you will be notified in the installation progress window. After that, you 
can close both that and the Package Installer window.
13C-2: Running and Setting Up Picasa
Once Picasa is installed, you can run it by going to the Applications menu and 
selecting GraphicsPicasaPicasa or OtherPicasa (the location varies, 
even with difference user accounts on the same computer!). The first time 
you do this, you will be greeted by a warning window telling you that Picasa 
can be integrated with GNOME so that whenever you hook up a digital cam-
era to your computer, GNOME will run Picasa in order to handle the photo 
importation process. Make the choice you feel most comfortable with, after 
which another window about Picasa/Firefox integration will appear (click 
OK), and then finally a Picasa License Agreement window will appear. Agree 
to what you’re asked by clicking Next and then in the next screen I Agree.
Picasa will then scan your desktop and home folder for images and add 
any images it finds to its library.
Working with Picasa should be very straightforward, but if you want to 
find out more, check out http://picasa.google.com/linux/. On that page, you 
will find a basic overview, links to more Linux-specific information (includ-
ing FAQ and forum pages), and a Picasa Getting Started Guide.
A Few Other Graphics Apps to Consider
In addition to the graphics applications I have covered in this chapter, there 
are still more available. You can grab all of them via the Ubuntu Software 
Center. Although you can experiment with what’s available, I will point out a 
few others worth noting. If nothing else, these applications will give you an 
idea of the breadth of stuff out there waiting for you.
gThumb Image Viewer
In earlier editions of Ubuntu, an application called gThumb (Figure 13-13), 
handy for use in photo-handling chores, used to come preinstalled. Some 
folks wish it still did. It has almost all the same features as F-Spot and a few of 
its own (such as creating original web album pages and some limited batch 
conversion capabilities). That said, it all really boils down to whether you pre-
fer F-Spot or gThumb (or even Picasa, for that matter). They’re all free and 
easy to use, so try them all to see which you like. If you do, install gThumb via 
the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for gthumb. Once installed, run it 
by selecting ApplicationsGraphicsgThumb Image Viewer.

Blender
Perhaps one of the most impressive open source applications available today 
is Blender. Blender (Figure 13-14) is a professional-level 3D modeling, ani-
mation, and rendering program. It is rather complex, but that is the source 
of its power and popularity (it comes in versions for just about every operating 
system out there). If you would like to find out a bit more about Blender 
before taking the time (and disk space) to install it, go to http://www.blender3d
.org/. Find it via the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for blender; once the 
program is installed, you can run it by selecting ApplicationsGraphics
Blender (fullscreen) or Blender (windowed). 
QCad
Another open source application that has found its way into almost all oper-
ating systems is QCad (Figure 13-15). QCad is a 2D computer-aided design 
(CAD) program with which you can create technical drawings such as room 
interiors, machine parts, or even musical instruments. (I’ve seen a plan for a 
Nyckelharpa done on QCad!) To find out more, go to the project home 
page at http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html/. Search the Ubuntu Software 
Center for qcad, and install the application. Once it is installed, you can run it

Tux Paint
To wrap things up, let’s turn to an application for the kids (or the kids within 
us) and have a look at Tux Paint. With its big colorful buttons and fun and 
funky tools, Tux Paint, shown in Figure 13-16, is an application that your chil-

opinion) are its stamps, of which there is a good variety—everything from

Music à la Linux
It’s now time to move on to the audio side 
of things. Yes, Linux does indeed rock, and 
in this chapter you will find out about those 
musical talents that your system possesses. You 
will learn how to rip CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis 
files (files that you can recognize by their .mp3 and .ogg 
filename extensions), add album cover art, change file tags, play music files, 
and burn files onto audio CDs that you can play in any CD player. You’ll also 
learn how to play a variety of audio streams. If you’re interested in learning 
how to work with your iPod, iPhone, or other digital media device, or how to 
convert audio files from one format to another, well, you’ll have to wait until 
Chapter 15.
Audio File Formats
Before we go any further, it is probably best to discuss the various formats in 
which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the 
de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the 

262
Chapter 14
.wav extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the .au extension), and 
AIFF (from Apple and using the .aiff extension), all of which are uncom-
pressed formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly 
large, with an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 
10MB per minute. To put that in perspective, back in 1988 my first Macin-
tosh had a 40MB hard disk—more space than I thought I would ever need 
but not enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s “Come as You Are.”
As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines 
they are today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done 
about those disk-space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were 
thus developed. These compression formats work, to oversimplify things a 
bit, by cutting out the portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot 
hear—sort of a dog-whistle approach. The most widely known and embraced 
of these audio compression formats is MP3. Audio files encoded in MP3 for-
mat can end up being as little as one-twelfth the size of the original WAV file 
without any noticeable loss in quality. 
Another audio compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. 
Ogg Vorbis was a product of the open source community, so, unlike MP3, 
which has always been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent 
rights, it was free of patent and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of 
that and the fact that it was the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and perfor-
mance (if not, as many claim, better), Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the 
Linux community.
As you work with ripping audio files in this chapter, you are sure to notice 
yet another encoding option—FLAC. Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is 
an encoding format that, unlike the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats, does not 
remove any audio information from the audio file during the encoding pro-
cess. The downside of this is that FLAC provides space savings of only 30 to 
50 percent, which is much less than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved 
by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. The upside, of course, is that the FLAC files should be 
equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.
Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC becomes an ideal choice if 
you are not satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 
files. It is also a good choice if you want to create both Ogg Vorbis and MP3 
files . . . or if you just don’t know which one you want to work with yet. In such 
cases, you can just rip the file and encode it in FLAC format. As I mentioned 
earlier, once you get to Chapter 15, you will learn how you can convert the 
FLAC file later, when you know what you want or need. 
All that talk about Ogg Vorbis and FLAC aside, there are still many people 
who like or need to deal with MP3 files. You may, for example, already have 
numerous MP3 files ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy lis-
tening to one of the many Internet radio streams that are broadcast in MP3 
format. Unfortunately, MP3 playback and encoding support is not included 
Project 14A: Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps

Tux Rocks
263
in Ubuntu because of licensing concerns. Even if you plan on using the Ogg 
Vorbis format in your future ripping and encoding endeavors, installing MP3 
support is a good idea so as to cover all your audio bases. It’s also a very easy 
process.
The easiest way to install MP3 playback support is to double-click an MP3 
file that you have on your hard disk. A window will appear, asking whether 
you want to search for the plug-ins necessary to play the file. Click Search, 
after which another window will appear, showing you what you need to install 
(Figure 14-1). Check both boxes in that window, click the Install button, and 
in the confirmation window that then appears, click Confirm. You will then 
be asked for your password, so provide it, and then just wait until the process 
is complete. Once done, you’ll be able to play not only your MP3 audio files 
but also MPEG and WMV videos.
Figure 14-1: Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.
If you prefer, you can download and install these plug-ins quite easily via 
the Ubuntu Software Center by doing a search for gstreamer and then installing 
gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg (GStreamer ffmpeg video plugin), gstreamer0.10-fluendo-
mp3 (Fluendo mp3 decoder GStreamer plugin), and gstreamer0.10-plugins-
ugly (GStreamer extra plugins).
As for MP3 encoding support, which enables you to rip CDs and create 
your own space-saving MP3 files, well, things aren’t so automatic. But it’s not 
much of a chore, either, because all you need to do is use the Ubuntu Software 
Center to search for and install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse. If you also 
want to give yourself AAC encoding ability, you should install gstreamer0.10-
plugins-bad-multiverse as well. You will then be ready for action, as described in 
the next section.

Rhythmbox—Your Audio Player
The main audio player in Ubuntu is called Rhythmbox (see Figure 14-2), 
which seems to function pretty much like a simplified version of Apple’s 
iTunes application. It’s a relatively easy-to-use audio player that, despite 
some quirkiness in its early stages, has developed quite a following in the 
Linux world. To run Rhythmbox, just go to the Applications menu and 
select Sound & VideoRhythmbox Music Player.
Figure 14-2: The Rhythmbox audio player
Adding Songs and Albums to the Rhythmbox Library
If you are familiar with Apple’s iTunes, then you should understand 
the Library in Rhythmbox too, because it is essentially the same concept. 
Rhythmbox should automatically import everything you have in your Music 
folder without any extra work on your part. If you prefer to add songs to the 
Rhythmbox library manually, you can open the preferences window (Edit
Preferences), click the Music tab, and then uncheck the Watch my library 
for new files box. After that, you can add new albums to your Rhythmbox 
Library by going to the Music menu, selecting Import Folder, and then navi-
gating to the folder for the new album you want to add. If you want to add a 
number of albums by the same artist, just navigate to and select the folder for 
that artist instead. If you want to add just a single audio file, you can also do 
that—select MusicImport File, and then navigate to the song in question.
If you are not the navigating type, you can also add files and folders by 
other means. The simplest way is to drag the folder or song you want to add 
to the Library into the right pane of the Rhythmbox window. You can also 

Tux Rocks
265
add a song to the Library directly by right-clicking the file and selecting 
Open withOpen with Rhythmbox in the pop-up menu that appears.
Ripping Audio CDs with Rhythmbox
Like iTunes, Rhythmbox also allows you to rip songs directly from a CD; 
convert them to Ogg Vorbis, MP3, or other audio formats; and then add 
the ripped tracks to its music library. The steps are as follows:
1.
Open the Preferences window (EditPreferences), click the Music tab, 
and select the encoding format you want to use (Ogg Vorbis is the 
default). Once you’re done, click Close. Unless you change encoding 
formats often, you won’t have to do this more than once.
2.
Select your audio CD in the left pane of the Rhythmbox window.
3.
Click the Copy to library button in the upper-right part of the Rhythm-
box window. The ripping and encoding process will then begin, and the 
progress will show in the bottom-right corner of the Rhythmbox window. 
Once done, the ripped songs will automatically appear in the Rhythm-
box Library.
NOTE
If you have not installed the gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse package, the 
MP3 option will not appear in the Output Format menu.
Browsing the Rhythmbox Library
The Rhythmbox Library, which you can make visible by clicking Music in the 
left pane of the Rhythmbox window, is a collection of all the music you add 
to it. This can prove to be a bit unwieldy as your collection grows. Fortunately, 
Rhythmbox has a nice browser function, like the one in iTunes, that can be 
toggled on and off by clicking the Browse button, shown in Figure 14-3. This 
function allows you to see lists of the artists and albums in two separate panes 
above the main Library list. If you click a specific artist in the Artist pane, a 
list of albums by that artist will appear in the right pane. You can then double-
click one of the albums in that right pane to play it. If you want to play all the 
albums you have by that artist, just double-click the artist’s name in the left 
pane. All in all, it’s a very handy feature.
Figure 14-3: The Browse button in Rhythmbox
If you want to add a layer of categorization to the browser, you can do so by 
adding a Genre pane. To do this, just go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, 
select the General tab of the window that appears, and then select Genres, 
artists, and albums. After clicking the Close button in the Preferences win-
dow, you will have a three-pane browser in Rhythmbox (Figure 14-4).

266
Chapter 14
Figure 14-4: The Rhythmbox browser with expanded categorization
Creating Playlists in Rhythmbox
Of course, you can tailor things even further to match every situation and 
your every mood. There are days, after all, when you’re feeling a bit too 
ethereal for Adam Lambert (and thank goodness for that). To prepare for 
such moments, you can create playlists, which are lists of songs to be played 
in a predetermined order. Just think of each playlist as an all-request radio 
station . . . where all the requests are your own.
To create a playlist in Rhythmbox, select MusicPlaylistNew Playlist. 
When the Playlist icon appears in the left pane of the Rhythmbox window, 
type a name for the list, and then add the songs you want by simply dragging 
them from the Library pane to the Playlist icon. The songs themselves will 
remain in the Library, so you aren’t really moving anything—just creating 
aliases.
You can also create automatic playlists, which are lists that automatically 
scan the Library for songs that match your creation criteria. You could choose 
to create a list for the all the songs in your Library by a particular artist or 
of a specific genre. To do this, just select MusicPlaylistNew Automatic 
Playlist. A window will appear in which you can specify what the list is to con-
tain. You can even specify how many songs you want in the list.
Once you’ve created your lists, you can play one by clicking the list 
once and then clicking the Play button near the top of the window (or by 
just double-clicking the list).

Online Music Stores via Rhythmbox
While iTunes only has the iTunes store, Rhythmbox provides you with options, 
all of which can be accessed from the left pane in the Rhythmbox window 
under the Stores heading. Two of these stores, Jamendo and Magnatune, 
provide music released under Creative Commons or open license by inde-
pendent artists. The other store is the Ubuntu One Music Store, which pro-
vides music by major artists from the 7digital catalog. The songs sold there 
are free from the digital rights management (DRM) limitations found in 
many songs purchased from other online stores.
Other Cool Features in Rhythmbox
Rhythmbox includes a few cool features worth noting. In addition to being 
able to manage podcasts, it also supports displaying album cover art. As you 
can see in Figures 14-2 and 14-4, whenever you play a track in Rhythmbox, 
the album cover art for that track is automatically downloaded and displayed 
in the lower-left corner of the window (assuming that Rhythmbox can find 
the cover online).
Another cool feature has to do with lyrics. To use this feature, you must 
first activate it by selecting the Edit menu and selecting Plugins. In the Con-
figure Plugins window that appears (Figure 14-5), check the Song Lyrics box, 
and then click the Close button. After that, go to the View menu, and select 
Song Lyrics. Rhythmbox will then search the Internet for the lyrics to the 
track you are currently playing and display them in a separate window 
(Figure 14-6).
Figure 14-5: Activating Rhythmbox’s lyrics function

Chapter 14
Finally, if you are an iTunes user and attached to a bit of visual stimula-
tion while playing your tunes, Rhythmbox can now satisfy you with a visual-
izer of its own. To activate it, go to the View menu and select Visualization 
(you can turn it off in the same way). The right half of the Rhythmbox window 
will then be filled with the wild, swirling shapes and colors of psychedelia that 
you’ve come to know and love.
Figure 14-6: Rhythmbox displays the lyrics to the track 
currently playing.
In addition to allowing you to play audio CDs or the music you have stored 
on your hard disk, Rhythmbox also allows you to play Internet radio streams 
in either MP3 or Ogg Vorbis format. To add a stream, click the Radio icon in 
the left pane of the Rhythmbox window—you will come face to face with only 
about a dozen stations the first time around. In this project, I will try to fatten 
up your collection a bit by showing you how you can add streams on your own.
14B-1: Adding Radio Streams to Rhythmbox
To get started, let’s try adding FIP, a French music station specializing in the 
eclectic. The process for adding FIP is essentially the same for adding any 
other stream. Here are the steps:
1.
Click Radio in the left pane of the Rhythmbox window.
2.
At the right end of the button strip below the menu bar, click the Create 
new Internet Radio Station button (the one that looks like a little red 
radio).
3.
In the window that then appears, type http://www.tv-radio.com/station/
fip_mp3/fip_mp3-128k.m3u/, and click Add.
4.
Double-click the new entry for your stream to play it.

14B-2: Adding Additional Radio Streams to Rhythmbox
Now that you’ve had a taste of what Rhythmbox does with radio, you may 
well be hungry for more. Ah, but where do you find these radio streams? For 
the largest collection of MP3 streams, go to http://www.shoutcast.com/, find a 
stream that seems interesting to you, right-click the Tune In! button for that 
stream, and then select Copy Link Location in the pop-up menu. After that, 
paste the URL in the URL box of Rhythmbox’s New Internet Radio Station 
window, and click Add. You can then double-click the stream in the right 
pane of the Rhythmbox window to play it.
Creating Audio CDs
All this talk about encoding and listening to MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files on 
your computer is fine and dandy, but there are no doubt times when you 
would like to have your songs on a plain audio CD that you can play while 
you slog your way to work on the New Jersey Turnpike or the Ventura Free-
way. Luckily, this is easy enough to do, and there are a couple of ways to go 
about it.
Burning Audio CDs with Rhythmbox
For Rhythmbox users, the easiest way of going about things is to do it all from 
within Rhythmbox. To do this, first create a playlist with the songs you want 
to burn to CD, and then click the Create Audio CD button. A confirmation 
window will appear, asking you whether you want to create the CD you’ve just 
The only problem with what 
you’ve just done is that the title of 
the stream appears in the Rhythm-
box window as the URL you typed 
in, and the genre, for its part, 
appears as unknown. Needless to 
say, this isn’t all that handy a way 
to have things, especially once you 
have more than a couple of streams 
listed and have to go wading through 
them to figure out what is what.
Remedying this state of affairs 
is a simple process. Just right-click 
the stream, and select Properties. 
In the window that appears, change 
the content of the Title and Genre 
boxes so that they represent some-
thing more meaningful to you. As 
you can see in Figure 14-7, I used 
Radio France – FIP for the title and 
Eclectic for the genre.

genre properties in Rhythmbox

Chapter 14
set out to create. You no doubt do, so click the Create button, and copies of 
your tracks will be created in WAV format. When that process is complete, 
you will be prompted for a blank CD, so pop one into your drive, click OK, 
and the burn process will begin. When it’s done, the progress window will 
vanish, and your new audio CD should pop out of your drive. Simple.
Burning Audio CDs with Brasero
Another way to create “play-anywhere” audio CDs from your ripped MP3 and 
Ogg Vorbis files is with Brasero, which we first discussed in Chapter 7. To go 
this route, place a blank CD in your drive (and close the Nautilus window 
that pops up to handle it), and then select ApplicationsSound & Video
Brasero Disc Burner. When Brasero appears, click Audio project. Now add 
any mix of songs (in any mix of audio formats) to the blank area of the win-
dow. You can do this by navigating to the songs you want in the left panes 
and then clicking the Add button (or just dragging the files to the right 
pane). You can also drag files from any open Nautilus window to the right 
pane of the Brasero window.
As you add songs to the Brasero window, a bar at the bottom of the win-
dow will show you how much more space you have available on the disk (Fig-
ure 14-8). Keep an eye on that so as not to queue up more than your disk can 
hold. Once you are ready, just click the Burn button, and then click Burn in 
the setup window that appears after that. A progress window will appear, and 
once the burn is complete, Brasero will let you know and eject your disk. You 
can then take the disk, plop it in your car stereo or wherever else you want to 
play it, and enjoy the results.

14C-1: Downloading and Installing RealPlayer
Installing RealPlayer in Ubuntu, once a hit-or-miss sort of minor pain, is now 
easier than it’s ever been before, so you can rest easy as you go through this 
project. Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Open Firefox, go to http://www.real.com/realplayer/linux/, and click the 
Download DEB Installer link.
2.
In the window that then appears, accept the default option, Open with 
Gdebi Package Installer, by clicking OK.
3.
A Package Installer window will soon open showing you what you are 
about to install. Click the Install Package button, and then provide your 
password when prompted.
In a few seconds, RealPlayer and all the dependencies your system 
requires to run RealPlayer will be installed. When the process is done, close 
the Package Installer.
14C-2: Setting Up RealPlayer and Testing Your Installation
Once Real Player 11 is installed on your machine, you will need to go 
through the final setup steps and then test it all. You can start by selecting 
ApplicationsSound & VideoRealPlayer 11. A simple setup wizard will 
appear, which you will have no trouble with on your own, because all you 
really have to do is click the button in the bottom-right corner of the window 
a few times. Once you have completed the wizard, the RealPlayer window will 
appear.
Project 14C: Listening to RealMedia Streams with RealPlayer
Now that you know how to play 
MP3 Internet broadcast streams, it 
is time to help round out your sys-
tem a bit by installing RealPlayer 11 
(Figure 14-9). Although not as 
common as in the past, RealMedia 
streams are still widely available on 
the Internet. You can also use Real-
Player to play RealVideo streams, 
when they’re available.
Figure 14-9: RealPlayer 11

272
Chapter 14
You can test your installation of RealPlayer by making your way to a web-
site with RealAudio content, such as http://www.notmuch.com/. Click the link 
for any file you want to play, after which a window will appear asking you what 
to do with the file. Accept the default, /opt/real/RealPlayer/realplay (default), by 
clicking OK. RealPlayer will then open, playing the stream you chose.
Other Cool Audio Apps
The applications I have covered so far are only a taste of what Ubuntu has in 
store for you in its repositories. You can start by browsing through the offerings 
listed in the Ubuntu Software Center. Try them, keep them if you like them, or 
remove them if you don’t. After all, it doesn’t cost you anything in Linux.
To give you a starting point, I will mention a few applications that I think 
might be worth investigating.
Alternative Players
If the music players that I’ve covered in this chapter have whetted your appe-
tite for more, you are in luck—there are plenty of others, as a browse through 
Ubuntu Software Center’s Sound & Video category will reveal. Check out 
Exaile, Banshee, Audacious, and Listen to get started. Oh, and as you’ll 
find out in Chapter 16, if you haven’t discovered it already, the Totem video 
player that comes with your system also doubles as an audio player. Wow.
Streaming Music with Streamtuner
If you are an Internet radio junkie, there is probably no application as useful 
to you as Streamtuner (Figure 14-10). Streamtuner is, as its name implies, an 
online radio stream tuner. It works by downloading lists of available streams 
from a variety of sources, which you can then easily browse. When you find 
something you like, just select the stream, click the Tune in button, and the 
stream will open in the player of your choice. The default player for most 
streams is Audacious, so when you download Streamtuner, the Ubuntu Soft-
ware Center will also automatically download Audacious, which is a pretty 
cool audio player. You can, however, switch the default player for Stream-
tuner playback by going to its Edit menu, selecting Preferences, and then 
in the right pane of the Preferences window, changing the default applica-
tions for playback by typing the command for the application you want to 
use. This is usually the name of the application in all lowercase letters. For 
example, if you want your playback to be from Totem, you would click Listen 
to a .m3u file, scroll to the right, and change audacious %q to totem %q.
You’ll also be happy to know that you can rip the streams you are listen-
ing to (and even those you aren’t listening to) and save them as MP3 files. To 
record a stream from within Streamtuner, just right-click the target stream, 
and select Record in the pop-up menu.

EasyTAG and Audio Tag Tool
For the true audio geek, these two applications allow you to alter the tags of 
your MP3 and Ogg Vorbis music files. EasyTAG is the more full-featured of 
the two, but Audio Tag Tool (Figure 14-11) has a friendlier user interface. 
Give ’em both a try and see what you think. Search the Ubuntu Software 
Center for easytag or tagtool, install one or both, and then locate either by 
selecting ApplicationsSound & Video, and then making the appropriate 
choice in the submenu.

LMMS
Linux MultiMedia Studio (LMMS) is a combination tracker/sequencer/
synthesizer/sampler with a modern, user-friendly, graphical user interface—
at least that’s what the LMMS home page suggests. I can’t swear to how easy it 
is to use, because I don’t know much about apps in this genre. But there is a 
lot of hoopla about it in the Linux world, and it sure looks cool, as you can 
see in Figure 14-12. It sounds really cool too (try the demos once you install 
it). Search the Ubuntu Software Center for lmms, install the program, and 
run it by selecting ApplicationsSound & VideoLinux MultiMedia Studio.
Figure 14-12: Creating music with LMMS
Audacity
If you’re interested in podcasting, one application you will find repeatedly 
mentioned is Audacity. Audacity (Figure 14-13) is a multiplatform audio 
recording and editing application that is frequently used not only in the 
Linux world but in the Mac and Windows worlds as well. It allows you to 
cut and paste bits of sound, raise pitch, increase speed, add echo and other 
effects, and . . . well, all sorts of other neat stuff. Get it via Ubuntu Software 
Center by doing a search for and then installing audacity. Audacity will then 
be available by selecting ApplicationsSound & VideoAudacity.
MuseScore
It would be a pity to wrap up this music chapter without mentioning 
the straightforward and very capable music notation program, MuseScore. 
MuseScore (Figure 14-14) allows you to create sheet music, either by mouse, 
keyboard, or midi device, with up to four voices per staff. It also allows you to 
play back the compositions you’ve put to the page. This is a great feature for 
folks like me, who can’t read music but find themselves wanting to figure out

Working with Your iPod, iPhone, and Other Digital Media Devices
With all the talk in the previous chapter 
about ripping, encoding, and playing back 
audio files, you may be wondering whether 
Ubuntu will allow you to transfer any of those 
files to your digital media devices, such as your MP3 
player or cell phone. Well, you will be happy to know 
that using your device on your Ubuntu system is quite 
easy—easier than ever before. No longer do you have 
to mess around with mount and unmount commands 
or edit system tables, and if you don’t know what I’m 
talking about, consider yourself lucky. Just plug in your 
device, and Ubuntu will do the rest.

278
Chapter 15
Knowing Your Limits
Assuming you downloaded and installed the recommended audio codecs 
mentioned in Chapter 14, you shouldn’t encounter any problems handling 
music or podcasts on your digital media device in Ubuntu. Even if you didn’t 
install them, Ubuntu should automatically help you find the necessary items 
if you try to play a file it doesn’t support out of the box. Nevertheless, not all 
formats will work with equal degrees of comfort or success—it depends on 
your device and the file format’s compatibility with Ubuntu. As a general rule 
of thumb, most players will be able to handle MP3 files and unlocked AAC 
(.m4a) files. Check your device’s manual for specifics about other file formats 
(or just give them a try).
As far as Ubuntu goes, it can work with all the file formats mentioned 
with the exception of locked AAC files, but you will learn how to deal with 
this later in the chapter.
NOTE
Although working with your digital media devices in Ubuntu has become increasingly 
simple, it is still a relatively new procedure. It is always worth approaching things with 
a bit of caution by making sure to have backups of the files on your device before work-
ing with it on Ubuntu.
Mounting and Ejecting Your iPod or iPhone
Working with your iPod or iPhone is an extremely simple process. Basically, 
just plug it in via a USB connector, and Ubuntu will mount the device so you can 
access it. An icon for your device will then appear on the desktop (Figure 15-1) 
and in the left pane of any Nautilus window you happen to have open. Two 
of those what-do-you-want-me-to-do-with-this-stuff type of windows that 
appear when you insert a music CD or DVD into your drive or connect a digital 
camera to your machine via USB cable—one for the music and podcasts on your 
device and one for the photos (also shown in Figure 15-1)—will also appear, 
usually one directly above the other. By default, Ubuntu will point you to 
Rhythmbox for music-handling chores and to F-Spot for photo handling, 
both of which will be discussed later in the chapter. Click OK in each win-
dow to accept Ubuntu’s choices.
To “eject” your iPod or iPhone, either right-click the desktop icon for 
the device and select Eject or, from a Nautilus window, click the eject button 
next to the icon for your device in the side pane of the window.

(Not) Auto-updating Your iPod or iPhone
With the simple instructions as to how to use your iPod or iPhone with Ubuntu 
out of the way, it’s worth thinking about a couple of other things. Most impor-
tant of these is the device’s auto-updating settings. When you enable auto-update 
on your iPod or iPhone via iTunes, the function is set up within the device 
itself. You can use your iPod in Windows, Mac OS, or Linux—or all of them 
interchangeably. If you set up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, 
however, you are leaving yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly 
the same music collection on all of your machines.

280
Chapter 15
The reason for this is simple. Although iTunes allows you to add files to 
your iPod, it does not allow you to copy files from it. The auto-update feature 
is thus strictly a one-way street. This means that whenever you hook up your 
auto-update–enabled iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will auto-
matically add the tracks in its library to your iPod; more frighteningly, it will 
remove any tracks from your iPod that are not present in that machine’s 
iTunes library. I learned this the hard way when I took my wife’s loaded iPod 
to work and plugged it into my office Winbox with its completely empty iTunes 
library. When I brought the little Podster back home to her with nothing at 
all on it, well . . . what ensued wasn’t pretty.
Make sure to disable your iPod’s auto-update function before bringing 
the device into the Linux world. To do this, connect your iPod to your Mac 
or Windows machine, and open iTunes. In the left pane of the iTunes window, 
click your iPod in the Devices section, and then in the Summary tab in the 
right pane, check the box next to the words Manually manage music (or Manually 
manage music and videos in video-capable iPods), as shown in Figure 15-2. Next, 
if you have a photo-capable device, repeat nearly the same process for your 
photos by clicking the Photos tab in the right pane and then unchecking the 
box next to the words Sync photos from.

Working with Android-Based Phones
Although the iPhone continues to be the king of the smartphone hill, it now 
has some strong competition from phones running Google’s Android oper-
ating system. Fortunately, working with your Android-powered device in Ubuntu 

Pluggin’ In he Penguin
281
is quite simple, and it’s only slightly different from working with an iPhone 
or iPod. Basically, this is the process:
1.
Connect your computer and Android-powered device using the USB 
cable that came with it.
2.
A “USB Connected” notification should appear on the notification bar at 
the top of your phone’s screen. Drag down the notification bar, and then 
touch USB Connected.
3.
A dialog box should then appear on your phone asking you to either 
mount or cancel the connection. Touch Mount.
NOTE
Because there are different versions of the Android system in service today, it is possible 
that the details of the process described here might be slightly different from that for your 
phone. You should still be able to follow along.
As with the iPhone, iPod touch, and photo-capable iPods, two windows 
will then appear asking you whether you want to run Rhythmbox to handle 
your music files and F-Spot for your photo files. An icon for your device should 
then appear on your desktop and in the side pane of any Nautilus window 
(Figure 15-3).
Figure 15-3: Ubuntu recognizes your Android-powered device and provides you 
with a number of ways to work with it.

282
Chapter 15
To “eject” your Android device, either right-click the desktop icon for 
the device and select Eject or, from a Nautilus window, click the eject button 
next to the icon for your device in the side pane of the window. On your phone, 
then drag open the notification tray, and touch Turn off USB storage. In the 
dialog box that then appears, touch Turn Off.
Working with Other Digital Media Players and Cell Phones
Although the iPod may be the most popular digital media player out there 
and the iPhone holds the crown in the smartphone market, they are by no 
means the only games in town. As I have already shown, Android-based phones 
are also quite popular, and there are still other devices, ranging from simple 
$15 USB MP3 players to the Linux-based Palm Pre cellular phone.
How to work with these devices in Ubuntu can vary by device, but for the 
most part, they should work either in the same manner as an iPod or Android 
device or in the same manner as a USB data device. The Palm Pre, which 
uses a Linux-based operating system, works in Ubuntu in the same way as the 
iPhone, while the $19 generic MP3 player I bought at Office Depot acts like a 
USB thumb drive. The simplest way to see how your device will work is to 
connect it to your computer via a USB cable. If windows asking you how to 
deal with the device do not appear, open a Nautilus window to see whether 
you find an icon for the device there. If so, you can work with your device 
using the tried-and-true drag-and-drop method. You can also use Rhythmbox 
to work with the audio files on your generic device by doing the following:
1.
Create a Music folder if there isn’t one already on the device.
2.
Right-click the Music folder, and select Open with Other Application.
3.
In the Open with window, select Rhythmbox (Figure 15-4), and then 
click Open.
Managing Your Audio Device’s Audio Files with Rhythmbox
As I’ve already mentioned, Rhythmbox is set as the default application for 
iPhones, iPods, Android-powered devices, and, one way or another, any 
other music players in Ubuntu. Once Rhythmbox is up and running, things 
work pretty much as they do in iTunes.
z
To view the contents of your iPod or other device, click the icon for the 
device in the left pane of the window. The contents of the device will then 
appear in the right pane of the window.
z
To copy a song from your library to your device, just click Music in the 
Library section of the left pane, and then drag the artists, albums, or sin-
gle tracks you want from the right pane to your device’s icon in the left 
pane. The copy progress will be shown in a progress bar in the lower-
right corner of the Rhythmbox window (Figure 15-5).

Chapter 15
Copying Songs from Your Audio Device to Your Hard Disk
One feature of most digital media players that isn’t available in iTunes (at 
least not without the installation of a special freeware plug-in) is the ability to 
copy songs from your iPhone/iPod to your hard disk (or even to an external 
USB drive). Luckily, Rhythmbox allows you to do this quite easily.
To copy music from your iPhone/iPod, Android based phone, or other 
digital media device with Rhythmbox, select the tracks you want to export 
(hold down the CTRL key to make multiple selections, or use the tabs to select 
whole artists or genres if you like), and drag the selected items to your desktop, 
music folder, or wherever you want them. The only catch with this seemingly 
simple approach is that when copying files from an iPod/iPhone, you end 
up with files on your hard disk with funky filenames, such as ZPAD.m4a or 
ATDT.mp3, rather than the name that appeared on your iPhone/iPod or within 
Rhythmbox. This means you’ll have to rename the files once they have been 
transferred to your hard disk, which isn’t much of a chore unless you’re deal-
ing with lots and lots of files or if you just forget which file is which. In case of 
the latter, right-click the file, click Properties, and then click the Audio tab, 
where you will find the original filename (Figure 15-6). Once you know it, click 
the Basic tab, type the correct name in the Name box, and then click Close.

Ejecting Your iPod or Other Digital Device from Within Rhythmbox
When you’re done working with your iPod or other digital device in Rhythmbox, 
you can eject it either by clicking its entry in the left pane of the Rhythmbox 
window and then clicking the Eject button near the top of the window or 
by right-clicking its icon in the left pane and selecting Eject in the pop-up 
menu that appears. If Rhythmbox is closed, this right-click-to-eject approach 
also works from within a Nautilus window or with the desktop icon for a 
mounted device.
Problems Writing to Your iPod
If you have an iPod (iPhones and iPod touch not included) that you were last 
using in conjunction with a Mac, you may find that although you can read 
the files on your iPod, you cannot write files to it. It is most likely that your 
iPod is formatted in Apple’s native HFS+ filesystem, although this in itself is 
not a problem. The problem is that HFS+ formatted iPods have journaling 
enabled. Journaling is an HFS+ feature that acts to protect the filesystem from 
damage due to power surges, power failures, or hardware breakdowns.
As fate would have it, however, the Linux kernel doesn’t deal well with 
journaling-enabled, HFS+ formatted devices. Fortunately, the tweak to fix 
this is quite simple, and it isn’t even particularly geeky: You just have to disable 
journaling on your iPod.
Disabling journaling on an HFS+ formatted iPod is a very easy task if you 
have a Mac nearby. Just plug your iPod into a Mac, close iTunes when it auto-
matically opens, and then run Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder within the 
Applications folder). When Disk Utility opens, select your iPod (by name) in 
the left pane of the window, press the OPTION key, and then choose Disable 
Journaling in the File menu. After a moment, journaling on your iPod will 
be disabled without any loss of data. If you connect your iPod to your Linux 
machine again, you will be able to use it more or less like normal.
Working with Photos on Your Digital Device
As I already mentioned, if your phone or digital device is photo-capable and 
Ubuntu automatically recognizes it, you will be led to F-Spot Photo Manager, 
just as you are when you hook up your digital camera to your Ubuntu machine. 
In the same way, F-Spot takes stock of what you have on your device and then 
allows you to copy photos to your hard disk.
As you can see in Figure 15-7, you first select the photos you want to copy 
to your hard disk, add a tag if you like, and then click Copy. After the photos are 
copied to your disk, they will appear in the main F-Spot window (Figure 15-8), 
from which you can work with them as you see fit.

Converting Audio File Formats
As I pointed out at the beginning of the chapter, there may be some points 
of incompatibility when it comes to certain audio file formats, your hard-
ware, and Ubuntu. Fortunately, SoundConverter (shown in Figure 15-9) 
makes it easy to convert Ogg Vorbis files to MP3 format, or vice versa. It can 
also convert AAC files to MP3 or Ogg Vorbis format, if that is of interest to you. 
Because SoundConverter does not come bundled with Ubuntu, you will have 
to install it. To do so, just run the Ubuntu Software Center, search for 
soundconverter, and install the application.
Figure 15-9: Converting audio file formats with SoundConverter
To use SoundConverter, just select ApplicationsSound & Video
Sound Converter. Once SoundConverter starts, add the songs you want to 
convert to the main pane by clicking either the Add File or Add Folder button. 
You can also drag audio files from your Music folder (or wherever else you 
store them).
Once you’ve chosen the files to convert, you need to choose which format 
to convert them to. You can do this by selecting EditPreferences and then 
making your choice in the Preferences window (Figure 15-10). While you’re 
there, it is also a good idea to tell SoundConverter to place your converted 
files in a location other than the folder where the original files are stored. 
Doing this prevents having to deal with duplicates in Linux audio playback 
applications that automatically scan your Music folder, such as Rhythmbox. 
You might also want to check the Create subfolders box to keep things orga-
nized. 
Once you have set things up and are ready to convert, click Close 
in the Preferences window, and then click Convert in the main window. 
SoundConverter will then begin doing its stuff.

Playing Locked AAC (M4P) Files
If you purchased music from the iTunes Store before Apple did away with digi-
tal rights management (DRM) in its music, chances are you are in possession 
of some locked AAC files, which you can recognize by the .m4p extension. 
These files can be played only on registered machines through iTunes. As 
you might have already discovered, you cannot do much with such files on 
your system as is. All you will get when you try to play one is an error message 
and an option to have Ubuntu search for the missing plug-in. Accepting that 
option is the easiest way to get the support you need to play such files within 
Ubuntu.
Once you accept, Ubuntu will search for the plug-in and necessary sup-
port files. Once Ubuntu finds them, it will show the result of its search in a 
new window (Figure 15-11). Click Install to continue. When the process is 
complete, you will be able to play previously locked AAC files on your system. 
If Rhythmbox was running while the installation process was taking place, 
however, you will need to restart it before it will be able to handle the files.

Linux on Your iPod?
One thing you might notice if you do a Google search on using your iPod with 
Linux is that it is possible to actually replace your iPod’s Apple-designed oper-
ating system with a form of Linux. Now, I am not advocating that you do this 
(and I most certainly have not done so myself), but some folks are interested 
in geeking around with whatever gadget they have in their hands. If you’re 
such a person or if you’re just curious, check out http://www.ipodlinux.org/, or 
the even more popular Rockbox (http://www.rockbox.org/), which also runs 
on a number of other, non-Apple, devices.
Working with . . . Your iPad?
Apple’s newest offering, the iPad, has been on the shelves only a short 
time, and yet Linux enthusiasts are already trying the iPad out with Linux 
machines. Reports are that the iPad “mostly” works as of the current version, 
Ubuntu 10.04. If you want to see how the iPad works with your Ubuntu-
powered PC, just connect the two by USB cable, and play around to see 
how it goes. Just remember that you’re doing so at your own risk.

Video and DVD Playback in Ubuntu
Now that I’ve covered much of what 
Ubuntu can do in terms of audio, it’s time 
to turn your attention to what is arguably 
the second most important of its talents in the 
CNN/MTV-era world: video. Ubuntu is quite capable 
in terms of video playback, allowing you to view video files you download 
from the Internet or from your digital movie camera, video CDs (VCDs), 
DVDs, and some Internet video streams. It even allows you to download 
movies from your digital video camera and then edit them.
DVDs
Your system allows you to play DVDs; however, due to licensing concerns, 
playback is limited to unencrypted discs by default. Unfortunately, this rules 
out a vast majority of the DVD movies you buy or rent at your local video 
shop and leaves you with a rather limited choice of movies that you can play 
on your computer. Given the limited offerings in the unencrypted DVD world, 
you will no doubt want to enable your system to play the encrypted variety.

292
Chapter 16
As I already mentioned, Ubuntu does not allow you to play encrypted DVDs 
from the start. For you to watch such DVDs (and that would be the vast majority 
of them), you need to install a whole bunch of stuff, most crucially, the package 
libdvdread4. Fortunately, if you installed the audio support files I mentioned 
in Chapter 14, you’re halfway there. If you didn’t install them or if you just 
want to double-check, start by running the Ubuntu Software Center, and 
then make sure you have those files and a few useful others installed. If any-
thing is missing, install it. Here’s what you need to have:
z
gst-plugins-base
z
gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
z
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
z
gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
z
gst-ffmpeg
z
libdvdread4
Now you’ve come to the final and essential step required for this project. 
For this task, you’re going to have to turn to the trusty ol’ Terminal 
(ApplicationsAccessoriesTerminal). Once the Terminal is open, type 
the following command, and then press ENTER:
sudo apt-get install libdvdread4 
With just about any other application, you would be done at this point, 
but libdvdread4 requires you to also run an installation script that comes 
with it in order to fully get the job done. To run the script, go back to the 
Terminal, type the following, and then press ENTER:
sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh
Once the Terminal returns you to the user prompt, the process will be 
done. Try putting a DVD in your drive—Totem should open and start play-
ing the DVD. (You’ll learn more about Totem soon.) If it doesn’t work, open 
the Ubuntu Software Center, and check to make sure all the support plug-ins 
listed earlier are installed. If everything is there, go back to the Terminal, 
and perform the last two steps again. 
Can I Play Foreign DVDs?
Your computer can play DVDs of any broadcast standard (NTSC, PAL, or 
SECAM) and of any regional encoding. This is a better setup than the DVD 
player you have hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of stand-alone 
DVD players in the United States (I would venture to guess 99.9 percent) do 
Project 16A: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs

Couch Penguins
293
not allow you to play anything other than Region 1 NTSC discs (NTSC being 
the broadcast standard in the United States and what its televisions are 
designed to display, while the DVD region is 1). This information is usually 
provided on the back of DVD packages (see the examples in Figure 16-1), 
though the packaging for most discs produced for the U.S. market does not 
include it.
Figure 16-1: Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages
Despite the wonderful everything-goes nature of your computer in terms 
of DVD playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the 
manufacturer of your DVD drive, you will be able to switch back and forth 
between DVDs of differing regional encodings only four or five times. After 
that, the drive will be locked into the regional encoding of the disc you were 
playing at that time . . . forever. This is unrelated to your operating system—it 
is strictly a hardware matter. The only exception to this region-lock rule are 
those DVDs labeled Region Free or ALL (sometimes inaccurately labeled as 
Region 0), which can be played on any DVD player in any region and thus do 
not register as a regional encoding switch when you plop one of them in your 
computer’s DVD drive.
If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially one 
for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That news comes in the 
form of Videolan’s libdvdcss2, the library that is included in the libdvdread4 
package you installed in Project 16A.The libdvdcss2 library allows you to play 
back encrypted DVDs. In addition to that primary function, libdvdcss2 also, in 
theory, allows you to play back DVDs from multiple regions even if your DVD 
drive is already locked into one region. It does this by performing a cryptic 
attack (to use Videolan’s term for it) on your drive until it can find the disc 
key for that drive. Of course, this process of cryptic bombardment can take 
several minutes, so it is not the optimal way of going about things. It’s better 
than being stuck, though. Whether this process of bypassing regional encod-
ings is legal remains a subject of debate, so if you are concerned about such 
things, you should do a little research.
Totem Movie Player
The default video player in Ubuntu is Totem, which, as you can see in Fig-
ure 16-2, has a very simple interface that makes using it equally simple. You 
can run Totem by selecting ApplicationsSound & VideoMovie Player. 
You can also run it, as you have just learned, by simply placing a DVD in your 
drive, because Ubuntu is set up to run Totem any time you do so.

Figure 16-2: Totem movie player
Using Totem to Play DVDs, VCDs, and Other Multimedia Files
As I already mentioned, you can play a DVD in Totem by simply placing your 
DVD in the drive, after which Totem will open and begin playing your movie. 
If you’ve got a copy of Red Detachment of Women on VCD that you’re aching to 
watch, you can do so in the same way. Just pop the VCD in your drive; Totem 
should start up and begin playing it. 
Not only does Totem play DVDs and VCDs, but it can also play MPEG 
files, and because you installed that big cocktail of packages I keep going 
on about, it can play WMV files too. You can play such files by either double-
clicking them directly or going to the Totem Movie menu, selecting Open, 
and then navigating to the video file you want to view.
Totem as an Audio Player?
You may have noticed while on the Display tab of the Preferences window 
that there was a Visual Effects section. Well, those visual effects aren’t for the 
videos you play but rather are visualizations to accompany your audio files 
when played via Totem (Figure 16-3). Yes, Totem not only does video but 
also does audio. In fact, it is, somewhat oddly, the default audio player for 
Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files in Ubuntu. Just double-click one of those files, and 
sure enough, Totem will be the application that pops up, blasting your ears

out with your favorite melodies. Of course, you can also play such files from 
the Totem Movie menu by selecting Open and then navigating to the songs 
you want to play. If you have a CD in your disc drive, you can even use 
Totem as a CD player by going to the Movie menu and selecting Play Disc 
‘Audio Disc’. 
Figure 16-3: Totem as an audio player
A Couple of Other Cool Totem Features
Totem has a couple other cool features that you might like to know about. 
One is its ability to perform screen captures of whatever video you happen 
to be viewing at the time. Just select EditTake Screenshot, and you’ve got 
yourself a screen capture—a still image taken from a video file.
Another feature worth mentioning is Totem’s Sidebar. As you no doubt 
noticed, at the bottom-right corner of the Totem window there is a Sidebar 
button. If you click that button, a new pane will open at the right side of the 
Totem window. In that pane you can select and listen to BBC podcasts; search 
for and watch YouTube videos (Figure 16-4); and load, create, and save play-
lists. You can select from among these various functions from the drop-down 
menu button at the top of the Sidebar.
The playlists you create can consist of any combination of supported 
video or audio files, thus providing you with the whole multimedia banana. 
Any time you play a file in Totem, that file appears in the Playlist pane, but 
you can also add items to the list by simply dragging the files there from your 
desktop or any Nautilus window.

An Alternative to Totem: VLC Media Player
Although the Totem video player has made great strides since it first appeared, 
some users find it somewhat temperamental and quirky. Luckily there are 
alternatives, like the VLC media player. VLC (Figure 16-5) is a very capable 
alternative player and is also available on Mac and Windows platforms. Like 
Totem, it also handles audio files as well as video and audio streams, includ-
ing YouTube.

Editing Digital Video with PiTiVi 
Digital video cameras have become increasingly common in recent years, and 
still digital cameras (and even phones!) have also become more impressive in 
terms of their video-handling capabilities. In addition, more and more peo-
ple are sharing their video creations on YouTube—it’s fair to say that home 
digital video is just about ubiquitous. Linux support for video processing is 
also catching up, though it’s not quite 100 percent there.
Ubuntu’s default video editor is called PiTiVi (Figure 16-6). You can run 
it by going to the Applications menu and selecting Sound & VideoPitivi 
Video Editor.
Figure 16-6: PiTiVi video editor
As you will immediately see, PiTiVi lacks the bells and whistles of applica-
tions like iMovie or Windows Live Movie Maker. It really is little more than a 
movie editor, allowing you only to trim and combine video clips. Some of its 

298
Chapter 16
greatest limitations are its inability to capture video from digital video cameras 
or video streams, its inability to apply transitions or effects to videos, and, to 
top it all off, its inability to add titles to videos. Although these features are 
promised for the future, the fact that they are not available now makes the 
decision to bundle PiTiVi with Ubuntu a rather peculiar one.
Limitations and peculiarities aside, the actual editing process in PiTiVi 
is relatively straightforward. First you start a new project and decide its name 
and settings (ProjectProject Settings). Then you add files to that project, 
either by dragging and dropping from your home folder to the PiTiVi window 
or by clicking the Import clips button and then selecting the files you want to 
add via the Import a clip window that appears. The files, now called clips, will 
then appear in the Clip Library pane of the PiTiVi window. From that pane, 
you can drag the clips you want to work on to the timeline below and then 
split the clips, delete the embarrassing or boring bits out, and combine files 
(Figure 16-7). Be sure to save your project as you go along. 
Figure 16-7: Editing video with PiTiVi
Once done with your editing, you can produce your new film by clicking 
the Render project button, after which a Render project window will appear. 
In that window, click the Choose File button, and then give your new film a 
title in the Choose file to render to window. This will be the name of the actual 
file that will be produced. Once done, click OK, and then click the Render 

Couch Penguins
299
button. The progress of the rendering process will be shown in the Render 
project window, and when it is done, the words Rendering Complete will appear. 
You can then close the Render project window and PiTiVi as well. Be sure to 
save your project when prompted to do so.
For more detailed information on using PiTiVi, have a look at the user 
manual, which is available from the PiTiVi site at http://www.PiTiVi.org/.
When you want to transfer a digital image or a digital video from your digital 
still camera to your computer, you just have to download it from camera to 
computer. When you want to transfer a video clip to your computer from a 
digital video (DV) camera that saves its data on tape or from a video stream, 
however, there is no way to simply drag it from one place to another. You 
have to capture the video stream to disk while you play it, and to do that you 
need some sort of software solution. This is usually found in the form of the 
system’s video editor; however, as I mentioned in the previous section, Ubuntu’s 
bundled video editor, PiTiVi, is not yet capable of doing this. This means you 
will have to install another editor, and the old-time favorite for this is Kino 
(Figure 16-8).

Chapter 16
16B-1: Installing Kino and Setting Up Your System
The first and easiest step is to download and install Kino. Just go to the 
Ubuntu Software Center to do this. Once installed, you can take a look at 
Kino by selecting ApplicationsSound & VideoKino. At this point, you 
can use to Kino to work with video files you already have on your hard disk 
and start capturing video. If, however, your camera connects to your computer 
via a FireWire (IEEE 1394) connector, you must perform a few steps the first 
time around so your system can recognize the connection:
1.
Connect your camera to your computer using the FireWire cable that 
came with (or you were forced to buy for) your camera.
2.
Turn on your DV camera in play mode. Once you’ve done this, the raw1394 
module will appear in your system’s /dev directory, though you won’t see 
any indication of this up front.
3.
After a few seconds, turn off your camera, but leave the cable connected.
4.
Open a Terminal window, type cd /dev, and press ENTER.
5.
In the same Terminal window, change the permissions of the raw1394 
module so that everyone on your machine can read and write to it by 
typing sudo chmod a+rw raw1394 and pressing ENTER.
6.
Type your password when prompted, and then press ENTER.
If all goes without a hitch, you will be returned to your user prompt with-
out any other messages appearing in the Terminal. You can then close the 
Terminal window.
16B-2: Capturing and Editing Digital Video with Kino
Once you have gone through the preparatory steps I’ve just mentioned, you 
are ready to capture video from your camera. To do this, connect your camera 
to your computer (if it isn’t already connected), turn on your camera to Play 
mode, and then start up Kino. Once Kino is open, click the Capture tab to 
the right of the playback pane.
Now you can use the playback controls located below the playback pane. 
These control buttons actually control the functions of your camera. Start by 
clicking the Rewind button until you get to the beginning of the video seg-
ment you want to capture. Once you get there, click the Play button, after 
which the video on your camera will play back within the Kino window. 
When you reach the point at which you want to start capturing, click the 
Capture button just above the play back controls in the Kino window. Kino 
will then start capturing your video to disk (in your home folder by default) 
and show you what it is capturing in the main pane of the window (Figure 16-
9). To keep things easy to manage, the captured video stream will be split 
into several files, the number of which depends on the length of the video 
played.

When you get to the point where you’d like to stop capturing, click the 
Stop button. You can then view the captured video by clicking the Edit tab 
and then using the playback controls at the bottom of the playback pane. 
You can also view the video in Timeline view (as shown in Figure 16-10) to 
navigate between the various segments of the video: Click the Timeline tab, 
click the segment you want to view, and then use the playback controls below 
the playback pane.
If you feel like getting a bit arty, you can also try the effects available in 
Kino (some examples of which are shown in Figure 16-11) by clicking the FX 
tab and then playing around with the various effects in the drop-down menu 
below the words Video Filter. Make your choice, and specify the segment you’d 
like to convert (or at least experiment with) by typing the beginning and 
ending frame numbers in the boxes below the word Overwrite. To see the 
results of the filter without saving the changes to disk, click the Play button. 
If you decide you want to convert the segment to keep the effect, click the 
Render button, and Kino will create a new file of just that segment. You can 
also double-click those files (as well as the original captures) to view them in 
Totem, which is better suited to viewing videos than Kino.

Other Video Apps
I’ve covered the main video applications in Ubuntu, but there are still others 
that you might want to consider, all of which are available via the Ubuntu 
Software Center. If you are interested in yet another alternative video/DVD 
player, you can try GNOME MPlayer, which has long had quite a significant 
following because of its ability to handle numerous video formats.
Another cool application for video streaming enthusiasts is Miro Inter-
net TV (Figure 16-12), which allows you to easily search, download, and play 
online video streams. Just perform an Ubuntu Software Center search for miro.
If you have a webcam, you might also want to try an application called 
Cheese, which allows you take pictures and videos from your webcam and 
add cool graphical effects. Camorama is yet another webcam viewer/capture 
application to think about. 
If you’re looking for an alternative to PiViTi and Kino, try Avidemux. 
One very handy feature makes it worth having, even if you don’t use it as 
your main video editor: It can rip audio tracks from video files. You can get 
Avidemux from the Ubuntu Software Center. Be sure to install the GTK+ 
version (not the Qt one).
For those of you interested in ripping DVDs, you might try DVD:Rip, 
AcidRip DVD Ripper, or the less daunting to figure out Thoggen DVD Ripper. 
You might also be interested in DVD95 and the more highly configurable 
K9copy, which are the Linux world’s answers to DVDShrink. These applica-
tions allow you to rip dual-layer DVDs (DVD9) and compress the output so 
that it will fit on a single-layer blank DVD disc (DVD5). For creating your 
own DVDs from scratch (like you would with iDVD), a few applications are 
worth considering: DVD Styler, QDVDAuthor, and Bombono DVD.

Linux Gaming
Many people hate to admit it, but games 
are a big attraction to almost everyone at 
the helm of a personal computer. Even those 
who deny being gamers often find themselves 
caught in the act of rapping off a quick round of soli-
taire between work projects. As a Linux user, you will 
most likely find that one of the most common questions
you will be asked about Linux by users of other operating systems is, “What 
games does it have?” Well, although there might not be as many games in the 
Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose 
from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.
Ubuntu, for example, comes with the games AisleRiot Solitaire (a collec-
tion of more than 80 solitaire card games), gbrainy (a collection of puzzles, 
memory trainers, and brain teasers, shown in Figure 17-1), Mahjongg (a tile-
matching game, similar to the one introduced in Chapter 9), Mines (the 
Linux world’s answer to Minesweeper), Quadrapassel (a Tetris clone), and 
Sudoku. Many other free games are available via the Ubuntu Software Center 
(and other sources), some of which you will learn about in this chapter.

Expanding your gaming repertoire is quite easily done via the Ubuntu Software 
Center. In this project, you’ll be plugging in a few gaming holes by installing 
some classic Linux games. The steps in this project are basically a review of 
what you learned in Chapter 6, so there will be no challenging work involved—
just fire up the Ubuntu Software Center and click away.
17A-1: Installing Missing GNOME Games 
The standard GNOME collection of games includes a number that were not 
included in Ubuntu 10.04 for the sake of space. These include several tradi-
tional favorites, such as the puzzlers Tetravex (Figure 17-2), which you can 
think of as a triangular form of dominoes, and Klotski (Figure 17-3), which 
is a challenging block-moving exercise. The collection also includes Same

GNOME (a GNOME version of the Japanese marble-matching game Same 
Game), Tali (an ancient Roman form of poker played with dice), Iagno (a 
GNOME clone of Reversi), Nibbles (one of those old-fashioned snake games), 
Five or More (a matching game based on the old Windows game Color Lines), 
Robots (a weird little “classic,” in which you run around avoiding robots), 
Blackjack, and Chess.
Figure 17-2: Tetravex
Figure 17-3: Klotski
These games come bundled as a single package called GNOME Games. 
To download and install the package via the Ubuntu Software Center, just 
search for gnome-games, and then install it. Once the installation is com-
plete, the games will appear in the Games section of the Applications menu.
17A-2: Installing Some Linux Classics: Frozen Bubble, Tux Racer, and Pingus
Several other games might be called Linux classics, either because they’re Linux 
originals or because they are penguin-themed, in honor of Linux’s cuddly 
penguin mascot Tux. One of the most well-known and well-liked of these is 
Frozen Bubble (Figure 17-4). Frozen Bubble qualifies as the ultimate Linux 
classic: It was written for Linux, it’s Linux (penguin) themed, and Linux versions 

308
Chapter 17
are always released first. It has since been ported to Mac OS, Windows, and 
even iPhone and Android systems, but Frozen Bubble’s soul is pure penguin.
Figure 17-4: Frozen Bubble
The objective of Frozen Bubble is simple: Clear the screen by matching 
like-colored bubbles, and move on to the next level. This may sound boring, 
but never fear—you’ll be hooked in no time.
To get Frozen Bubble, search for frozen-bubble in the Ubuntu Software 
Center, and install it. You can then run Frozen Bubble by selecting 
ApplicationsGamesFrozen-Bubble.
Another Linux-themed game you might be interested in is Extreme Tux 
Racer (Figure 17-5). It’s a rather odd (but fun) race-against-the-clock sort of 
game, in which you guide Tux as he slides down a long, icy mountain trail. You 
should be aware, however, that unless you have an accelerated graphics card, 
Extreme Tux Racer will run painfully slowly. If you’re not sure whether your 
computer can handle it, just give it a shot and see for yourself—it’s free, after all!
To install Extreme Tux Racer, search the Ubuntu Software Center for 
extreme tux racer, and install it. It will appear in the Games menu.
Unlike Extreme Tux Racer, Pingus (Figure 17-6) is a game that has no 
special graphical requirements. It’s a maze game, based on the old classic 
Lemmings. Your goal is to lead your group of adorable little penguins safely 
to the end of each level, without letting them be dashed to bits on the dan-
gerous obstacles awaiting them. There are 22 playable levels included with 
the game, and if you’re feeling adventurous, you can try playing some of the 
untested levels—there are more than 200 of them! For instructions on playing 
these extra levels, visit http://pingus.seul.org/faq.html/.
To play Pingus, search the Ubuntu Software Center for pingus, and 
install it. You’ll find it right where you would expect, in the Games menu.

3D Games
Most of the games I’ve mentioned so far are a little, well . . . two-dimensional. 
Sure, 2D games can be fun—I’ve certainly lost a significant portion of my life 
to Sudoku—but they don’t have the excitement factor that you get from 
shooting hordes of aliens or crashing a high-powered sports car into a wall. 
Unfortunately, games designers have traditionally neglected Linux to con-
centrate on the significantly larger Windows market, so up until a couple of 
years ago there were few Linux-friendly 3D games to choose from. As the 
penguin has grown in popularity, however, people have started to take notice, 
and more Windows games now come with a Linux version.
The open source gaming community has come on leaps and bounds too, 
and there are some really high-quality games now. In this section I’ll run 
through a few of my favorites, after first making sure that your computer can 
handle the strain of 3D graphics.
Checking for Hardware Acceleration
To play 3D games, you need a graphics card that can handle hardware acceleration. 
Without hardware acceleration, your computer’s processor has to try to do 
all of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn’t designed), 
so your games end up running at a snail’s pace, if at all. Most modern graphics 
cards have some hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is 
enabled will depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find 
out how good 3D support is for your graphics card at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/.
If you just want to know whether you have the minimum level of accel-
eration required to play games, then open a Terminal (Applications
AccessoriesTerminal), type glxinfo | grep rendering, and press ENTER. (That 
vertical line is the “pipe” symbol and can normally be inserted by pressing 
SHIFT and \ on your keyboard.) If you get a message telling you that glxinfo 
isn’t installed, use the Ubuntu Software Center to install mesa-utils and then 
try again.
If hardware acceleration is enabled, you’ll see direct rendering: Yes appear 
in the Terminal. That’s good news, because it means you can skip to the next 
section and sink your teeth into some three-dimensional gaming goodness.
If you received the message direct rendering: No instead, you’ll need to 
install different graphics drivers if you want hardware acceleration to work. 
See “Games/Compiz Don’t Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers” 
on page 394 for instructions.
NOTE
Many of the default graphics drivers for Linux can’t handle anti-aliasing, which is 
the feature that removes jagged edges from graphics, making them look smoother and 
more life-like. If you can’t live without anti-aliasing, you should also see Chapter 21 
for information on installing a better graphics driver.

Shooting Games
Like many people, my first real 3D gaming experiences were with first-person 
shooter (FPS) games. In fact, I still have a soft spot for Doom, arguably the 
granddaddy of all FPSs. What could be more fun than battling endless waves 
of hellish monsters in a military outpost on Mars? Nothing!
Doom looks a little dated nowadays, but if you have similarly nostalgic 
thoughts of this classic game, you’ll be pleased to know that a version is avail-
able for Ubuntu. It’s called Freedoom (Figure 17-7), and you can install it 
from the Ubuntu Software Center (like all the games in this section).
Figure 17-7: Freedoom
The gameplay in Doom may have aged gracefully, but the graphics sure 
haven’t. If pixilated blobs are failing to intimidate you, why not try something 
a little smoother, in the form of Nexuiz (Figure 17-8)? In terms of gameplay, 
Nexuiz feels quite similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect a wide array of 
weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting at oppo-
nents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most deathmatch-style 
games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are other game 
modes, like “capture the flag.” There’s also an online multiplayer option if 
you’re finding that the computer-controlled opponents aren’t providing 
enough of a challenge.
Tremulous (Figure 17-9) is another popular open source FPS, although its 
gameplay also contains elements of real-time strategy. You play online, taking 
the side of either humans or aliens. As you work to destroy the opposing team, 
you build structures and collect power-ups to gain as much of an advantage 
as you can. It can get quite involved, so I recommend that you read the notes 
at http://www.tremulous.net/ before you begin playing.

Plenty of other FPSs are available: AssaultCube, Warsow, and Alien 
Arena immediately spring to mind. Check out the GamesArcade section in 
the Ubuntu Software Center to see what else you can find.

Strategy Games
I enjoy first-person shooters, but my reaction times aren’t quite up to scratch. 
If the thought of running around a virtual world and shooting at things leaves 
you feeling cold (or clumsy), perhaps a strategy game is more your style. There 
are plenty of these waiting to be discovered in the Ubuntu Software Center, 
but I thought I’d mention a couple of good ones here.
Warzone 2100 (Figure 17-10) is broadly similar to the Command and 
Conquer series of games. You start off on a battleground with a small collec-
tion of vehicles, which you must command to build a base and defend it from 
enemies. Once your base is in good shape, you can build new units and send 
them to attack your foes. Your opponents are doing the same, however, so 
battles can turn into subtle tactical affairs, where your ability to launch success-
ful attacks must be balanced against the limited availability of resources and 
the constant threat of your base being destroyed.
Figure 17-10: Warzone 2100
If you’re struggling to find the time to mastermind an entire military 
campaign, perhaps Wormux (Figure 17-11) will be more your kind of thing. 
It’s a clone of the popular Worms game, which sees you in command of a 
small team of heavily armed worms (or, in the case of Wormux, open source 
mascots like the Firefox fox) scattered around an oddly shaped landscape. 
You take turns, using your overstocked arsenal to remove opponents from 
the map in elaborate ways before they can do the same to you. It’s definitely 
worth playing, if only for the interesting sound effects. . . .

Simulators
Waging war isn’t everyone’s idea of escapism, which is why an extensive col-
lection of simulation games are available for Linux. I’ve tried to cover as many 
bases as possible in this section, but as always, you should peruse the Ubuntu 
Software Center if you don’t see anything here that appeals to you.
When I think of simulation games, my mind immediately jumps to Sim 
City, the venerable city-building game. As the mayor, you’re in charge of run-
ning your city: You plan construction work, build and maintain transport links, 
and set budgets and taxes. Throw the odd natural disaster into the mix, and 
you have a challenge on your hands! The Linux equivalents of Sim City are 
LinCity-NG and OpenCity. I prefer LinCity (Figure 17-12)—the graphics 
seem friendlier and more cartoonish—but you should try both and decide 
for yourself. The original Sim City game is available too, if you don’t mind 
playing a game with old-fashioned graphics. Just search for Micropolis in the 
Ubuntu Software Center (it was renamed for legal reasons).
The hardcore flight simulator enthusiasts among you will want to take a 
look at FlightGear (Figure 17-13). The focus is definitely on realism, with all 
sorts of cockpit controls and aircraft for you to play with. If you really want 
the full experience, there’s even an Earth-sized online multiplayer map to fly 
around. If you’re not already in possession of a pilot’s license, then it might 
be a good idea to read the manual before you play; you can find it at http://
www.flightgear.org/Docs/getstart/getstart.html/.

A little less serious than FlightGear is Torcs, a motor racing game (Fig-
ure 17-14). It’s a pretty standard track racer, where you speed around a circuit 
against computer-controlled opponents. It has a good choice of cars, tracks, 
and race styles, and more are available on the Torcs website at http://torcs
.sourceforge.net/. If off-road racing is more your style, take a look at the Trigger 
rally game. It’s not as well developed as Torcs, but it makes for a change.
Figure 17-14: Torcs
If you’ll permit me to stretch the definition of “simulator” just a little, 
there’s also a neat rockstar simulator called Frets on Fire (Figure 17-15). The 
gameplay is very much like Guitar Hero, but with one major difference: You 
use your keyboard to play notes rather than a guitar-shaped controller. How-
ever, if you don’t mind doing a little tinkering, you can get your Guitar Hero 
controller to work with Frets on Fire. (See http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/using-
guitar-hero-controller/.) Plastic guitar or not, it’s an addictive game.

Even More 3D Games—Beyond the Ubuntu Software Center
I hope you’ve found something agreeable among my recommendations so 
far, but it’s hardly an exhaustive list. In fact, hundreds of games will run on 
Ubuntu that haven’t made their way into the Ubuntu Software Center yet.
PlayDeb (http://www.playdeb.net/) is a good source of extra games. Every-
thing on PlayDeb is available through its own Ubuntu-friendly software 
repository, so you’ll be able to install its games through the Ubuntu Software 
Center once you’ve added the PlayDeb repository to your list. See “Adding 
Extra Software Repositories” on page 86 for full details—the APT line that 
you need is deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu lucid-getdeb games.
In the next chapter, I’ll also explain how you can run Windows games in 
Ubuntu using Wine. Indeed, this is how many people enjoy big commercial 
titles that don’t have Linux versions: Guild Wars, Spore, and Call of Duty are 
just a few examples of games that can be run flawlessly in this way. If this sounds 
like your sort of thing, Project 18C-3 will be of particular interest to you—a 
neat little app called PlayOnLinux (Figure 17-16) can be used to handle 
most of the fiddly configuration stuff that is often required to get less-well-
supported games running under Wine.

As you can see from all the games discussed thus far in this chapter, the 
Ubuntu Software Center is a great one-stop shop for most Linux games. As 
you have also learned, however, there are also many games beyond those in 
the Ubuntu Software Center. These include the games you worked with in 
Chapter 9 that were written in scripting languages, such as the Python-based 
pyWings and the Tcl/Tk–based Briscola, but it just wouldn’t be right to leave 
out games written in what might be considered the mother of all scripting 
languages—Java. In this project, you’ll learn how to install the Java Runtime 
Environment and how to install and run the Java-based version of a classic 
Austrian card game: Schnapsen.
17B-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment
To run Java-based applications, or scripts, you need to first install the Java 
Runtime Environment. You can do this via the Ubuntu Software Center by 
searching for and installing openjdk java 6 runtime. The whole set of Java pack-
ages is pretty hefty in terms of download weight, so don’t get freaked out if it 
seems to take longer than usual. When the process is complete, close the 
Ubuntu Software Center, and move on to the next part of the project.

17B-2: Getting and Extracting Schnapsen
Once you’ve installed the Java Runtime Environment, you need to run a Java 
application in order to see it at work. The application you’ll be installing is one 
I had been searching for ever since I moved to the world of Linux, a 20-card 
Austrian card game called Schnapsen, shown in Figure 17-17.
To get started, you will need to download and extract Schnapsen. Here’s 
what you need to do:
1.
Open your web browser, and go to http://projects.hagru.at/tjger/en/.
2.
On that page, click the Schnapsen link in the left frame.
3.
In the right frame, click Schnapsen.zip.

In the Opening Schnapsen_1.00.zip window that then appears, accept 
the default, Open with Archive Manager, by clicking OK.
5.
When the Archive Manager window appears, click the Extract button, 
which will open the Extract window.
6.
In that window, click the Create Folder button, and create a folder within 
your home folder called Schnapsen. 
7.
Click the Extract button in that window, and when the extraction pro-
cess is complete, quit Archive Manager.

17B-3: Running and Anglicizing Schnapsen
Now that Schnapsen is in your home folder, it’s time to run it. Open a new 
Terminal window, and then do the following: 
1.
Move into the new Schnapsen folder by typing cd Schnapsen and pressing 
ENTER. 
2.
Type java –jar Schnapsen.jar (be sure to place a space between java and 
jar and use a capital S at the beginning of Schnapsen), and press ENTER. 
Schnapsen will soon appear, after which you can start playing . . . if you 
speak German.
In case you’re wondering, here’s what you did in that last line: The first 
part of the command string, java, calls the Java Runtime Environment into 
action; the –jar flag after that tells Java that you are going to be running a JAR 
file, which is what a Java script is called; and the last part is the actual file you 
are going to run, Schnapsen.jar. (In the future, if you choose to run other Java-
based applications, just follow the same pattern: java –jar application_name.jar.)
3.
To switch the interface into English, go to the Einstellungen menu, and 
select SpracheEnglisch.
4.
If you are not familiar with the German card faces and suits (referred to 
as Traditional in this game), you can switch them over to the French 
suits you probably know (diamonds, hearts, spades, and clubs) by going 
to the Settings menu and selecting French in both the Cards’ set and 
Trump sign menus (Figure 17-18).
Figure 17-18: Switching from German to 
French suits and card faces in Schnapsen
You are now set to play. There are some basic rules in the Help menu, 
but you can also learn the rules of Schnapsen (and any other card game in 
the world) in greater depth at http://www.pagat.com/. Have fun!

Online Gaming
With all this talk of installing games, it’s easy to forget that there are many 
games that you don’t have to install at all. Numerous websites allow you to 
play games online for free, as long as you have the proper browser plug-ins 
installed. (See “Multimedia Plug-Ins” on page 62 for help installing plug-ins.) 
For example, check out http://www.popcap.com/ and http://gametrick.net/ for 
some great online time-wasters. You can also play any of the games found on 
Facebook or other social networking sites, such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, 
without ever leaving the comfort of your Ubuntu desktop.
Searching for More Games
There are lots of other great games for Ubuntu that I haven’t covered, but 
rest assured that they’re out there. Some are available as DEB files, and can 
be installed in the same way you installed Skype in Chapter 6. A good exam-
ple is SDL Hana, a Linux version of the Japanese flower card game Hanafuda 
(Figure 17-19), which is available from http://savannah.nongnu.org/pr/sdlhana/.
Figure 17-19: SDL Hana
Still more are available from the Ubuntu Software Center: Some of my old-
time favorites include the Serbian Pac Man clone, Njam; and the Czech maze 
game, Fish Fillets NG, in which you guide two fish through all sorts of cum-
bersome, but very attractive, underwater locations.

322
Chapter 17
There’s plenty more available on the 3D side of things, too. In the beau-
tifully designed Yo Frankie! (Figure 17-20), you play an evil sheep-throwing 
squirrel called Frank, who runs through idyllic landscapes being chased by 
unfriendly animals—kids (and aesthetes) will love it. You can also lose your-
self in the Balazar role-playing game, with plenty of magic and monsters to 
keep you company; fly a space fighter in 4D in Adanaxis (yes, they managed 
to squeeze an extra dimension in there, sort of); and race go-karts, penguin-
style, in SuperTuxKart (Figure 17-21). 
Of course, you can just see what else there is in store for you by browsing 
the Ubuntu Software Center’s Games category. There’s a whole world of games 
out there, so enjoy the search.

Working with Ubuntu in a Windows World
Despite the rapidly growing popularity of 
Linux, it’s still very much a Windows world. 
If you’re anything like me, you’ll often find 
yourself working with people who use Windows, 
so it’s important to know how to make Ubuntu happily 
coexist with Microsoft’s ubiquitous OS. Fortunately,
Linux is just about the most accommodating operating system available and has 
no problems sharing files, reading Windows disks, and so forth. In fact, your 
Ubuntu programs probably support a wider range of file formats than their 
Windows equivalents; on more than one occasion I’ve tried to open a file in 
Windows, failed, and then booted into Ubuntu where I could open it effortlessly.
Of course, sharing files with others may not be your only Windows-related 
worry, especially if you’re a dual-booter. Plenty of people decide to run both 
Windows and Linux on their computer, so it pays to know how you can mini-
mize the bureaucracy involved in switching between the two. If you kept 
Windows for the sole purpose of running a specific application and you can’t 
find a Linux-compatible equivalent to it, perhaps you can save the effort of dual-
booting altogether and simply install the program directly onto Ubuntu. I told 
you Linux was accommodating . . . it’ll even adopt Windows programs as its own!

324
Chapter 18
Over the course of this chapter, you’ll learn how to make the most of 
your double operating system setup: You’ll install some Windows fonts, 
install some Windows programs, and share files on a Windows network. And 
if that isn’t quite enough Windows for you, you’ll even see how to run Win-
dows (in a window!) in Ubuntu. You might want to sit in a dark room for this 
one—if you’re not tired of windows already, you will be by the end of the 
chapter!
If you decided to dual-boot with Windows when you installed Ubuntu, then 
you’ll have a partition lurking somewhere on your hard disk filled with your 
Windows files and programs (see Chapter 2 if you need a refresher on how 
partitions work). You can access files on Windows by mounting the partition 
from within Ubuntu. When you mount a partition, the files are made avail-
able to you through Nautilus (and other programs)—mounting is just Linux’s 
way of recognizing a partition and preparing it for use.
18A-1: Mounting Your Windows Partition
Mounting your Windows partition in Linux used to be a bit of a chore, but 
that isn’t the case anymore (at least not in Ubuntu). In fact, all you have to 
do is open a Nautilus window and click the Windows partition in the side pane.
You will most likely find at least two hard disk icons in the side pane, so it 
is possible that you won’t be sure which one your Windows partition actually 
is. Just remember that your Linux partition is represented by the hard disk 
icon named File System. Things aren’t so simple for the Windows partition, 
unfortunately. It could be labeled OS (as shown in the side pane in Figure 18-1) 
or with the size of the partition followed by the word Media (for example, if 
your Windows partition is 80GB in size, it might appear as 80GB Media in the 
left pane). Or, it might be something else entirely. Guess which one it is, if 
necessary—it won’t hurt if you get it wrong.
Now that you know which disk icon is which, it’s time to get mounting! 
Just click the icon for the Windows partition in the Nautilus side pane. An 
Authenticate window may appear; type your Ubuntu password, and click the 
Authenticate button if it does. A new window showing the contents of your 
Windows partition will then appear.
NOTE
If you hibernated rather than quit Windows, you will most likely receive a “Cannot 
mount volume. You are not privileged to mount this volume.” error message when trying 
to mount your Windows partition. Some hibernated Windows partitions cannot be 
safely read-write mounted in Linux, because adding new files while Windows is hiber-
nated could seriously confuse it when it starts up again. To get full access to the drive, 
be sure to shut Windows down rather than hibernating.

18A-2: Unmounting Your Windows Partition
You can unmount your Windows partition immediately after finishing your 
work with it, or you can just wait until you shut down your system, whereupon 
it will be automatically unmounted. Before you can unmount it yourself, you 
must first make sure that none of your programs is accessing files or folders 
on the partition. Nautilus and the Terminal are the usual suspects, so before 
unmounting, close any Nautilus or Terminal windows that are browsing that 
partition. Once you’ve done that, click the little eject icon next to the Windows 
partition in the side pane of a Nautilus window (Figure 18-2), or right-click it 
and select Unmount.

Accessing a Linux Partition While Running Windows
Viewing your Windows files in Ubuntu isn’t too stressful, as you have no doubt 
just found out. But what about going the other way and getting Windows to 
recognize your Linux partition? Unfortunately, Windows isn’t too helpful in 
this respect—it can only view FAT or NTFS-format partitions and has no built-
in support for the ext format normally used by Linux. As such, if you need 
access to your Linux files in Windows, it’s probably easiest to create a separate 
FAT partition to be shared between both operating systems (see Appendix C). 
Hmmm, not exactly convenient.

326
Chapter 18
An alternative is to add support for Linux partitions into Windows by 
installing some extra software. Unfortunately, the state of such software is 
pretty dire: Support for the old-fashioned ext2 format is pretty good, but 
Ubuntu uses ext4 nowadays, which is a different beast entirely. As far as I can 
tell, the best that people have managed to do is to get an ext4 partition mounted 
in Windows in read-only mode. Although you won’t be able to add new files 
to the partition, at least you’ll be able to see what’s in there and copy them 
into Windows. See http://www.soluvas.com/read-browse-explore-open-ext2-ext3-ext4-
partition-filesystem-from-windows-7/ for an example of how you can do this.
Like it or not, the computing world is still pretty much a Microsoft world, 
and that means the vast majority of users, even Mac users, are using Microsoft 
fonts. That being the case, it is inevitable that you will have to deal with docu-
ments using fonts such as Georgia, Verdana, Times New Roman, and Courier, to 
name a few. Of course, your system can substitute the fonts it has for those 
used in the document. But for you to see things precisely as they were intended 
and to allow others to see your documents the way you intended, it will behoove 
you to install those Microsoft core fonts on your own system.
Fortunately for you, there are two ways to get these fonts. One is to down-
load and install them via the Ubuntu Software Center, while the other, for 
those of you with a dual-boot setup, is to simply copy them from your Windows 
partition. In the former case, all you need to do is install the Microsoft Core 
Fonts package using the Ubuntu Software Center. This is the older set of 
fonts from Windows XP, so installing this package won’t get you any of the 
swishy new fonts that are bundled with later Windows versions. When the 
installation process is complete, your new Microsoft fonts will have been success-
fully installed and made ready for immediate use by every user account on 
your machine. 
If you’re a dual-booter, you can copy the fonts directly from your Windows 
installation. This has the advantage of getting all your Windows fonts into 
Ubuntu, even the newer ones (if you have Vista or Windows 7 installed). 
Here’s what you need to do:
1.
Mount your Windows partition, as described in “Project 18A: Accessing 
Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)” on page 324.
2.
Open the Windows partition in Nautilus, and browse to the Windows/
Fonts folder.
3.
Now for a little trick: Select EditSelect Items Matching, type *.ttf in the 
box that appears, and click OK (Figure 18-3). This will select all the files 
in the folder with names ending in .ttf, which are all TrueType font files.
4.
Copy the files to a convenient location (somewhere in your home folder 
should do it).
Project 18B: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts

Penguins at the Gates
327
Figure 18-3: Selecting all the TrueType fonts in the Windows/Fonts folder
5.
Now, go back to the Windows/Fonts folder, and select EditSelect Items 
Matching again. This time, however, type *.TTF in the box. This will select 
the rest of the font files—the item selection feature is case sensitive, 
and the filenames use different cases for some reason. Copy the selected 
files as you did previously.
6.
With all the font files copied over into Ubuntu, you can now install them 
as you would any other font. At its simplest, this involves copying the files 
into the hidden .fonts folder in your home folder, but you should see 
“Project 8C: Installing TrueType Fonts” on page 143 for the full details. 
Dual-Booting: Changing the Boot Order and Timeout
If you chose to install Ubuntu alongside Windows in a “dual-boot” setup, you’ll 
be used to seeing the GRUB boot menu screen by now (Figure 18-4). This is 
the screen that appears every time you start up your computer and gives you the 
option of running either Windows or Ubuntu.
Ubuntu is started automatically if you don’t select a different option after a 
few seconds. This is fine for people who want to use Ubuntu for almost every-
thing but need to dip into Windows from time to time. If you spend more 
time in Windows, however, you might prefer to use that as the default operating 
system. To make the change, first use the Ubuntu Software Center to install 
StartUp-Manager, and then open it by selecting SystemAdministration
StartUp-Manager. You’ll probably be asked to enter your password, so do 
that and then wait a little while as it loads. Click the Boot options tab in the 
StartUp-Manager window (Figure 18-5), and select Windows from the Default 
operating system drop-down list. The actual name of the Windows option will 

328
Chapter 18
differ depending on which version you have installed—mine says Windows 7 
(loader), for example. From the next time you restart onward, Windows will 
boot automatically instead of Ubuntu.
Figure 18-4: The GRUB boot menu screen
Figure 18-5: Changing boot options with StartUp-Manager
NOTE
If you apply a major update to Ubuntu at some point, you may find that Windows is 
suddenly changed from being the default the next time you start the computer. This is 
because the update will have added a new entry to the boot list, causing the Windows 

Penguins at the Gates
329
item to slip down the list, where it won’t be recognized as the default any more. To fix 
this problem, open the StartUp-Manager, and reselect Windows as the default operating 
system again.
The StartUp-Manager lets you change the boot timeout too. By default, 
GRUB waits for 10 seconds before loading your default operating system, but 
I’m impatient and find this far too long to wait—so impatient, in fact, that I 
changed the Timeout in seconds option (also on the Boot options tab) to 
one so the menu is displayed only for a second. This might sound fast, but 
when I want to get into Windows, all I do is press the down arrow key a few 
times while my computer starts up. GRUB stops the timer when you press a 
key and just keeps the menu on the screen, so once that has happened, I’m 
free to choose the Windows option at my leisure.
Once you’re happy with your revised boot timeout and/or default oper-
ating system, click Close to apply the settings. StartUp-Manager will spend a 
few seconds making the requested changes, after which it will close. Restart 
the computer to see the updated boot menu in action.
Linux Equivalents to Your Windows Applications
Before going through the trouble of running Windows programs in Ubuntu, 
it’s a good idea to try some of the equivalent Linux applications. More often 
than not, there’s a native Linux program that will do exactly what you need, 
without any of the headaches involved with running an application designed 
for another operating system.
First, however, you have to find those Linux equivalents. Luckily, plenty 
of websites list good alternatives to Windows software: http://www.osalt.com/ 
and http://www.linuxalt.com/ are quite comprehensive, for example. Or, you 
can simply root around the Ubuntu Software Center, installing applications 
that tickle your fancy. After all, the best way to see whether you like a program 
is to try it!
NOTE
Some Windows programs don’t have direct equivalents in Ubuntu, so you might need 
to install a couple of programs to get similar functionality to your Windows software. 
In the rare cases where there aren’t any suitable alternatives, you can try using Wine or 
installing Windows in a virtual machine, which I’ll talk about next.
In Chapter 6 you learned a host of ways to add applications to your system, 
but you may not have considered one other method—installing Windows 
applications. Despite there being Linux equivalents for most of the Windows 
programs that you need, there may be one or two programs that you miss. 
Fortunately, it is possible to run some Windows applications from within 
Linux with the help of a program called Wine. The list of compatible software 
Project 18C: Running Windows Programs

330
Chapter 18
includes the likes of Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Adobe Photoshop, 
and a whole host of games, so if you’re desperately missing a particular pro-
gram, then it’s definitely worth a look.
It is only fair to point out that Wine continues to be a work in progress. It 
works well with some programs and not at all with others. Things are improv-
ing, however, and Wine now seems to work better with more applications. If 
you are curious as to which apps are known to run under Wine and to what 
degree of success, check out the Wine home page at http://www.winehq.org/, 
and click the AppDB link. The AppDB entries for programs often contain 
helpful advice on getting them to run in Wine, so check there first if you run 
into problems.
18C-1: Installing and Testing Wine
You can get Wine via the Ubuntu Software Center by doing a search for wine 
and installing the Wine Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (it should be 
the first search result). Once the installation is complete, you can test it by 
selecting ApplicationsWineProgramsAccessoriesNotepad. After a 
few seconds (longer the very first time you use Wine), the Windows Notepad 
will appear (Figure 18-6).
Figure 18-6: Windows Notepad running under Wine 
18C-2: Installing a Windows Application in Wine
Now that you’ve seen one Windows application in action under Wine, you 
might as well learn how you can install more yourself. I will point you to one 
application that will definitely work—a pretty cool text editor called NoteTab 
Light (Figure 18-7).
To get NoteTab Light, go to http://www.fookes.com/ftp/free/
NoteTab_Setup.exe, select Save File, and click OK in the window that appears to 
save the file in your Downloads folder.
When the download is complete, go to the Downloads folder, right-click 
the NoteTab_Setup.exe file, and select Properties from the pop-up menu. Then, 
go to the Permissions tab and check Allow executing file as program. Close 
the Properties window, right-click the file again, and this time select Open 
with Wine Windows Program Loader. A few moments after that, the same 
sort of setup wizard that you would see if you were installing NoteTab in 

Penguins at the Gates
331
Windows will appear (Figure 18-8). Go through the wizard, accept the license 
agreement, and then accept all the defaults along the way until the installa-
tion is complete. 
Figure 18-7: NoteTab Light running under Wine
Figure 18-8: A Windows installation wizard running under Wine
Running NoteTab Light is quite easy because it provides you with a desk-
top launcher. You’ll need to do a little more setting up first, though, because 
if you double-click the launcher now, you’ll get a warning about an “Untrusted 
Application Launcher.” To get rid of the warning, right-click the NoteTab 

332
Chapter 18
Light.desktop file on your desktop, and select Properties. Go to the Permis-
sions tab, and check Allow executing file as program (as you did earlier).
With that done, just double-click that launcher, and NoteTab Light will 
soon appear, just like a regular Linux app would. You can also run NoteTab 
Light and other Windows applications installed under Wine by selecting 
ApplicationsWinePrograms and then selecting the program you want 
to run. You might find, however, that some Wine-dependent applications will 
not appear in this menu until you log out and log back in after installing them.
18C-3: Getting Windows Apps to Work in Wine with PlayOnLinux
Some Windows software stubbornly refuses to work in Wine unless you have 
things set up in a specific way. The Wine website is full of tips on how to tweak 
settings until you hit on the magic formula that seems to work for a given 
program (settings that are practically guaranteed not to work for other pro-
grams you installed with Wine). Some instructions even ask you to install dif-
ferent versions of Wine for different programs! Fortunately, there’s a neat way 
to side step these issues, called PlayOnLinux. It handles all the settings tweaks 
for you and supports many commonly used Windows programs (and an espe-
cially large number of games). You can install PlayOnLinux in the usual way 
from the Ubuntu Software Center.
Once it’s installed, start PlayOnLinux by selecting ApplicationsGames
PlayOnLinux, and then click Forward. It’ll spend a minute or two updating 
its database of supported programs and will leave you at the main PlayOn-
Linux window (Figure 18-9) when it’s done. In that new window, click Install, 
and use the category pane or the search bar in the window that appears to 
look for a Windows program of your choice. In this example, I’ll install the 
delightful Crayon Physics game:
1.
Select the Games category, and find the Crayon Physics entry in the list 
(not the Deluxe version).
2.
Select Crayon Physics (as in Figure 18-10), and click Apply to start the 
installation process. If the window freezes, click the window’s close but-
ton, and then click Force Quit to convince the installer to start.
3.
Click Forward, and wait as the game is downloaded.
4.
If you like, check one or both of the boxes to put a shortcut to the game 
on the desktop and/or in your Applications menu. Then, click Forward 
and Forward again to finish the installation process.
5.
To start playing, double-click the Crayon Physics entry in the list of programs 
in the main PlayOnLinux window, or select it from that list and click Run.
Assuming that the game was installed successfully, you’ll be met with a 
Crayon Physics window. Click anywhere in that window, and you’ll see a land-
scape scrawled onto your display in crayon, similar to the one in Figure 18-11. 
The aim of the game is to draw boxes on the screen with your mouse, which 
land in such a way as to roll the ball onto a star. Every time you get the star, 
you move to the next level, where you’ll be forced to come up with a more 
ingenious ball-rolling strategy. It sounds simple, but I promise you it’s addictive!

Installing Windows Inside Ubuntu
One of the weirder things you can do with a computer is to run a simulation 
of a computer inside it. This simulation, known as virtual machine (VM) soft-
ware, allows you to install one operating system inside another, so you can run 
both at once without having to reboot. This is handy if you need to run Windows 
for some reason, perhaps for some specialized software, but are too comfort-
able working in Ubuntu to even contemplate going through the somewhat 
time-consuming rebooting procedure that dual-booters must follow to get 
back into Microsoft territory. You can even get Windows to sit there in, well, a 
window, which can be opened and closed at will just like any other program.
There are some caveats. First, the virtual machine has to share your com-
puter’s resources with all your other programs, so it can slow things down if 
you’re doing anything computationally strenuous. Second, it doesn’t have 
the same access to your computer’s hardware as the “real” operating system, 
so you probably won’t be able to get Windows-only devices working through 
the virtual machine. Finally, and perhaps most awkwardly, you need a Win-
dows installation CD to be able to put Windows into a VM, but most com-
puters only come supplied with a recovery CD, which won’t do the trick.

Penguins at the Gates
335
If you do have an installation CD, getting Windows into a VM doesn’t 
take much more work than getting it onto a real computer:
1.
Open the Ubuntu Software Center, and install VirtualBox. Other virtual 
machines are available, but I find this one the easiest to use.
2.
Select ApplicationsSystem ToolsSun VirtualBox to start it up, and 
click New followed by Next.
3.
Choose a name and type for your VM. The name is up to you, but the 
operating system should be set to Microsoft Windows.
4.
Click Next, and choose the amount of memory (system memory, not 
hard disk space) that you’d like the VM to have access to (Figure 18-12). 
This can be a tough decision; on one hand, you need enough memory 
for the “virtual” operating system to be able to run (Windows XP needs 
at least 128MB, for example), but you want to leave enough memory free 
for Ubuntu programs to be able to use it. VirtualBox normally suggests 
something sensible.
5.
Click Next again, and choose Create new hard disk (Figure 18-13). Make 
sure that Boot Hard Disk is checked too, and click Next to open the 
Create New Virtual Disk window.
6.
Run through the Virtual Disk Wizard, clicking Finish when you’re done; 
the defaults should be fine for most of the options, but you might want 
to choose the size of the virtual disk yourself. This will be used as the hard 
disk of the virtual machine and is stored as a file in a hidden folder inside 
your home folder. Again, choose a size that’s big enough to run the virtual 
OS but small enough that it doesn’t engulf your entire hard disk.
Figure 18-12: Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine

336
Chapter 18
Figure 18-13: Creating a new virtual hard disk
NOTE
If you choose Dynamically expanding storage as the storage type, the virtual disk 
will start off small and grow in size as you add more files in the virtual machine. This 
is a handy way of saving on disk space.
7.
With the virtual disk setup finished, you’ll be taken to a summary page 
where you can click Finish to create the virtual machine.
So far, so good. With a VM ready and rarin’ to go, it’s now time to install 
Windows; I’m going to leave the Windows specifics up to you (they’re a little 
outside the scope of this book, don’t you think?), but here’s what you need 
to do to get things started:
1.
Insert the Windows installation disc into your CD drive, and close any 
windows that open and ask what to do with it.
2.
Back in the main VirtualBox window, select your VM from the left pane, 
and click Start. A black window will open, along with a First Run Wizard; 
click Next.
3.
Make sure that CD/DVD-ROM Device is selected under Media Type, and 
click Next again.
4.
Click Finish, and the VM should try to boot from your Windows CD. After 
a few seconds you should be face to face with the Windows Installer. Have 
fun with that!
5.
Once the Windows installation has finished, the VM will restart. Remove 
the CD when prompted, and, after a few more minutes of setup, you 
should be staring a Windows desktop in the eye. Phew, hard work over!

Penguins at the Gates
337
NOTE
You can install Linux and other operating systems in virtual machines, as well as 
Windows. In fact, you could even install a VM within a VM, although you’d probably 
have to budget half a day to check your email if you had both of them running at once. 
Sharing Files with Windows Users on Your Network
One of the main reasons for connecting to a network (apart from accessing 
the Internet) is to share files between computers. You might be familiar with 
this concept already; network shares are used in many workplaces, and you 
may have even set one up before on your home network. For the uninitiated, 
a network share is a folder on another computer that you can access as if it 
were on your own. Files are transferred around on the network, so there’s no 
need to use a portable hard disk or flash drive to get them from one place to 
another.
Accessing Files Stored on a Windows Computer
Network shares are a two-way thing: You can either share your files with oth-
ers by creating a shared folder or access existing shared folders created by other 
people. If you’re connected to a network of Windows computers, then you 
probably have some network shares already. I talked about browsing network 
shares in some depth in “Using Nautilus as a Network Browser” on page 101, 
but to save you the anguish of flipping back so many pages, here’s a quick 
outline of what you need to do to access a share from Ubuntu:
1.
Select PlacesNetwork; Nautilus will open.
2.
Double-click the Windows Network folder to see a list of all the Windows 
computers connected to the network.
3.
Double-click one of the computers to see its shared folders.
4.
Pick a shared folder, and double-click it to access the files inside it.
Making Your Files Accessible from a Windows Computer
Since your Windows computers have so gladly made their files available on 
the network, let’s have Ubuntu reciprocate by sharing a folder of its own:
1.
Open Nautilus and find the folder you want to share; then right-click it, 
and select Sharing Options.
2.
Check Share this folder in the Folder Sharing window that appears.
3.
You’ll be told that the sharing service is not installed—click Install service, 
and wait for the installation process to finish.
4.
Back in the Folder Sharing window (Figure 18-14), choose a name for 
the shared folder, and type a comment if you like.

338
Chapter 18
Figure 18-14: Sharing a folder on the network
5.
Check Allow others to create or delete files in this folder if you want other 
people on the network to be able to modify the files you have there. If 
you don’t check this option, others will only be able to read and copy 
these files.
6.
By default, only people with a user account on your computer can access 
your shared folders. To make it so anyone on the network can access your 
shared files, check the Guest access option.
7.
Click Create Share to finish up.
Go to your Windows computer, and try to access the newly created share. 
Shared folders on Ubuntu computers can be accessed in the same way as any 
other share, so do whatever you would normally do to find it. (In Windows XP, 
for example, you’ll find it in your Network Shares folder.) If you can open a file 
in the shared folder, you’ll know that everything was set up correctly. 
If you don’t want to share a folder any more, right-click it in Nautilus, 
select Sharing Options, and uncheck Share this folder.

Security
Many a Windows user has entered the Linux 
fold after a host of bad experiences with 
malware in the Windows world—viruses, spy-
ware, and all sorts of other malicious bits of 
software code, too numerous to imagine. Windows is 
also plagued by a seemingly endless array of security 
vulnerabilities, leaving the system easy prey to invaders
with less than noble intentions. Every trip out into cyberspace thus becomes 
something like a run through the infectious diseases ward of a hospital. For a 
Windows user, it can sometimes seem that more time is spent ridding the sys-
tem of viral pests and defending it from invaders than is actually spent getting 
things done.
Fortunately, Linux does not suffer greatly from such problems, leading 
to the much-touted claim that Linux is practically virus free and quite secure. 
Numerous lines of reasoning have been proffered to explain Linux’s malware- 
and exploit-resistant nature. One reason is simply popularity—or lack thereof. 
Because Linux is not as widespread a system as Windows is, it is also a much 
less attractive target of digital evil-doers, who very often seem to be motivated 

340
Chapter 19
by the challenge and headline-catching glory that comes with creating a truly 
global virus or finding a theretofore unknown back door.
Another reason is that Linux users, as a general rule, work on their com-
puters in a nonprivilege mode, one in which the user does not have the right 
to install software without a password. This is not the case in some versions 
of Windows. A virus or other form of malware attached to an email or piggy-
backed upon another file or application cannot, therefore, install itself in 
your Linux system without that password . . . well, theoretically, at least. Of 
course, now that more recent versions of Windows use a privilege structure 
by default, this point is a bit less of an issue.
There is also the matter of structural design. Every system has security holes 
that can be exploited by digital and human foe alike. Windows might well be 
called the Swiss cheese of operating systems in this regard. Of course, Linux 
has its holes too, though far fewer of them than Windows does; and Linux 
plugs them through downloadable updates faster, once they are found.
Finally, Ubuntu’s preconfigured security policy brings a defensive edge—
there are no open incoming ports in Ubuntu desktop systems. This means 
your Ubuntu Linux system is even less susceptible to unwanted intrusions.
Does My System Need Protection?
So, with all this talk about Linux’s great security, you may wonder whether 
you need to bother worrying about it at all. Well, if you take a look at the 
Ubuntu forums, you might find yourself a bit confused. When asked whether 
Linux users need to install antivirus software or firewalls, most users answer 
with an emphatic no. On the other hand, you’ll find that an awful lot of people 
have installed or are trying to install that software. Hmmm.
So, what’s a Linux user to do?
If you are on a network where you transfer a lot of files among a lot of 
Windows machines, you might want to think about installing some antivirus 
software, if for nothing more than the good of the Windows systems involved 
and the users of those systems—your unenlightened (i.e., Windows-using) 
email pals, for example. You might also want to give it a go if you are, by 
nature, on the cautious side of the spectrum. Basically, if it makes you feel safer 
to install some protection, go ahead. If it makes you feel safer to go whole-hog 
and install the full line of defense mechanisms I cover in this chapter, go 
ahead. After all, either way you go, it isn’t going to cost you anything, and it 
certainly isn’t going to hurt you any.
The First Line of Defense
Regardless of the system you happen to be using (though I am assuming that 
you have become a Linux devotee by now), the first line of defense for any 
computer permanently hooked up to the Internet is a router—an electronic 
device that allows a number of computers on a local network (such as in your 
home or at your office) to connect to and share a single connection from your 

Defending he Nest
341
Internet service provider (ISP). While the router is connected to your modem 
via cable, the connection from the router to the computers on your local net-
work can be wired, wireless, or both.
What does a router have to do with the defense of your computer? Well, 
most routers include a firewall, which essentially functions to keep all of the 
bad stuff on the Web away from your computer, much in the way that the 
firewall in your car keeps the heat, fumes, and noise from your engine out of 
the passenger compartment. This built-in firewall is one reason that even 
people with only one computer, who could just as easily connect their com-
puter directly to their cable or DSL modem, use a router. Of course, just how 
much security the firewall in your router provides depends on which filters you 
select in the firewall setup software. For example, a very common and useful 
filter (particularly for those with a wireless network) limits Internet access to 
those machines specified on the firewall’s access list. This prevents your next-
door neighbors from hitching a wireless ride via your ISP connection. They 
aren’t paying the bill, after all.
The setup software for a router is built into the router, so you don’t have 
to worry about software installation and system compatibility. Using your router 
with Linux is no different from using it with Windows. You can access the 
software and modify your settings via a simple web browser, as you can see 
in Figure 19-1. Just type the IP address of the router (usually provided in the 
owner’s manual) in the browser’s location bar, press ENTER, and you’ll be 
ready to go.
Figure 19-1: Setting up a router

342
Chapter 19
Software Firewalls
If you don’t have a router and don’t plan on getting one or if you have one 
but are bordering on paranoia, you might want to consider using a software 
firewall, in particular one of the most popular software firewalls available for 
Linux, Firestarter.
You can get Firestarter via the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for 
firestarter and installing it. Once it is installed, run it by selecting System
AdministrationFirestarter (you might be asked for your password). Fire-
starter will open with a self-explanatory setup wizard the first time. Just read 
each screen carefully; make whatever selection are suggested, if any; and click 
the Forward button in each of the wizard screens until you get to the last one 
(shown in Figure 19-2). On that screen, make sure that the box next to Start 
firewall now is checked, and then click the Save button. The wizard window 
will then close, and the main Firestarter window will appear. Assuming the 
correct network device was detected and selected and the correct wizard 
choice made, the firewall will be up and running.
Figure 19-2: The last screen of the Firestarter setup wizard
If the wrong network device was selected, a warning window will appear 
telling you so. In that case, you can do a bit of trial-and-error manipulation 
by selecting EditPreferences in the main Firestarter window and then click-
ing Network Settings in the Preferences window that appears (Figure 19-3). 
In that window, select one of the other devices listed in the Detected device(s) 
drop-down menu, and then click the Accept button. Once back at the main 
Firestarter window, click the Start Firewall button (which looks like a Play 
button), and see what happens. If you still can’t start the firewall, repeat the 
process I’ve just described, this time selecting a different network device.

Once your firewall is up and 
running, there is nothing more 
that you really need to do. You 
can simply look at the Firestarter 
window (Figure 19-4) to see what 
is going on network-wise on your 
computer—which active con-
nections you have, how much 
information has been coming 
and going, and whether there 
have been any events in which, 
for example, the firewall has 
blocked an intruder. If you click 
the Events tab, you can then see 
the details of those events, such 
as what connection attempts 
were blocked, where they came 
from, and when they happened.
Figure 19-4: Firestarter in action

Chapter 19
Taking Control of Firestarter
You can control how Firestarter deals with various network events by creating 
your own policies. The default policy set in Firestarter allows you to do what-
ever you normally do via the Internet, while it blocks new connections to your 
computer from the Internet or any other computer on your network.
To make things a bit more draconian, you can click the Policy tab, select 
Outbound traffic policy in the Editing drop-down menu, and then select 
Restrictive by default, whitelist traffic. If you just want to deny anyone work-
ing on your computer access to a specific website, for instance, simply select 
Permissive by default, blacklist traffic, right-click the Deny connections to host 
field, and select Add Rule in the pop-up menu. In the Add new outbound 
rule window, enter the domain name for the targeted site (as in example.com), 
click Add, and then click the Apply Policy button in the main Firestarter win-
dow (it’s the one that looks like a green check mark).
Confirming That Firestarter Runs Automatically
After you run Firestarter the first time, it will set itself to automatically start 
up whenever you start your system. Don’t be concerned when you don’t see 
the graphical interface you saw when you first started it; Firestarter will be 
running in the background, silently protecting your computer.
If you are the doubting type, you can check to see whether Firestarter 
actually is running in the background by opening a Terminal window, typing 
sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter status, and then pressing ENTER. If Firestarter is 
running, you will see the message * Firestarter is running... in the Terminal 
window. Worries over. If Firestarter isn’t running, the response will read 
* Firestarter is stopped.
Finding Out More
If the world of firewalls is new to you, you can check out the Firestarter home 
page to learn a bit more. To check out the online manual, just to go to the 
Firestarter Help menu, and select Online Users’ Manual, which will open the 
page in your web browser. If you prefer to check out the manual before install-
ing Firestarter, point your browser to http://www.fs-security.com/docs/. You will 
also find a pretty good quick tutorial there.
ClamAV: Antivirus Software, Linux Style
Despite the lack of viruses that can wreak havoc upon your Linux system, your 
computer could still act as a transmitter of Windows viruses. As a result, a 
number of free antivirus scanners are available for Linux users interested in 
helping protect Windows users from viruses. These include Panda Desktop 
Secure (http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/downloads/desktopsecure/), 
f-Prot (http://www.f-prot.com/), and numerous others. For most Linux users, 
however, the virus scanner of choice is the open source contender: ClamAV.

Defending he Nest
345
Although it can be used on a number of operating systems, ClamAV is con-
sidered to be the Linux antivirus software package. It is open source and totally 
free, and you don’t have to worry about licenses or suffer the bother of renew-
ing them. Unfortunately, on its own, ClamAV is a command-driven applica-
tion, which makes it a bit less user-friendly. Fortunately for all involved, a 
graphical interface, albeit a simple one, is available; it goes by the name of 
ClamTk. Both ClamAV and ClamTk are available via the Ubuntu Software Cen-
ter—just search for clamtk, and install Virus Scanner. The Ubuntu Software 
Center will then automatically install ClamAV and all other packages it needs 
in order to run.
Once ClamAV is installed, you can perform a virus scan by selecting 
ApplicationsAccessoriesVirus Scanner. This will open the ClamTk Virus 
Scanner window (Figure 19-5).
Once up and running, you can scan your system on demand from the 
Scan menu. To scan a single folder, select A Directory. To scan a directory 
and everything within it, choose Recursive Scan. In either case, the Select a 
Directory window will appear. Select the folder or disc you want to scan, and 
click OK. ClamAV will then start scanning your system. ClamTk will let you 
know what it is scanning at any given moment in the empty space just below 
the button bar. If it finds anything suspicious, it will list that item in the main 
pane of the window.
Figure 19-5: ClamTk—the graphical interface for 
ClamAV
ClamAV is set up by default to check for signature updates when it starts. 
These signature updates tell ClamAV what new viruses to be on the lookout 
for. If you leave your machine on for days and days at a time, it is probably 
also a good idea to set things up so that ClamAV will automatically check 
for signature updates daily rather than just on startup. To do this, go to the 
Advanced menu, and select Scheduler. In the Schedule window, select a time 
for ClamAV to do its update check in the bottom half of the window. Click 
the Add button when done. You can also use this window to set up a time to 
regularly scan the system—just select the time you’d like the scan to occur, 
and click Add. When you’re finished, click Close.
As I mentioned, the only viruses you are likely to encounter during a virus 
scan are those designed for Windows systems, which cannot affect your Linux 
system. Although it won’t hurt you any to scan your entire system for viruses, 

346
Chapter 19
it is probably better to focus your virus-scanning activities on your Windows 
partition, if you have one, and on any files that you will be sending as email 
attachments, particularly to Windows users.
Although ClamAV may be the virus scanner of choice in the Linux world, 
my personal favorite is still avast!, which defended me during my Windows 
years. I think it is easier to use and, for what it’s worth, nicer to look at. On 
the downside, it does require you to register every year so that you can get a 
license key, but that is hardly a monumental task, and it is still free.
19A-1: Downloading the avast! DEB Package and License Key
First you have to get the avast! file and license key. You can do this by opening 
your web browser and going to http://www.avast.com/linux-home-edition/. Once 
you’re there, click the Download tab, and then download the DEB package 
of the avast! Linux Edition.
Once the download is complete, double-click the DEB package, and when 
the Package Installer window appears, click the Install Package button. You 
will then be prompted for your password, so provide that, and click OK. The 
download and installation will then begin. When these processes are com-
plete, close the notification window and the Package Installer. Once you’ve 
downloaded and installed avast!, you’ll need a license key in order to use it. 
Just go back to the avast! Download page in Firefox, click the registration 
form link, and then fill out and submit that form. You should receive your 
license key by email a few minutes later (though the page says it could take 
up to 24 hours).
19A-2: Running and Using avast!
Once avast! is installed, you can run it by selecting ApplicationsAccessories
avast! Antivirus. The first time you run avast!, a small window (Figure 19-6) 
will appear asking you to input your license code. Assuming you registered 
your free copy of avast! at the beginning of the project as I instructed you to 
do, your registration key should already be waiting for you in your email inbox. 
Copy the key, and paste it into the text field in the Registration window using 
CTRL-V or by right-clicking in the box and selecting Paste. Once the license 
key is in place, click the OK button.
The main avast! window (Figure 19-7) will now appear, but before you 
get started scanning away, it is a good idea to check for any updates to your 
virus database. New viruses are constantly appearing in cyberspace, so you 
should keep avast!’s virus database up-to-date so that it recognizes any viral 
newcomers. To perform the update, just click the Update database button, 
and let avast! do its thing.
Project 19A: Virus Scanning with avast!

347
Figure 19-6: Entering your avast! license key
Figure 19-7: avast! virus scanner
When avast! is done updating the virus database, you can get on to the 
work of virus scanning by first deciding whether you want to scan just your 
home directory, the entire system, or selected folders. You can also decide 
how thorough a scan you want to perform via the three choices available in 
the middle of the window: Quick, Standard, or Thorough. 
Which one of these sensitivity modes you choose depends on how thorough 
you want the scan to be. The Quick scan just scans files that end in certain 
extensions (.exe, .scr, .com, .doc, and so on), because these are the file types 

348
Chapter 19
that are most often virus carriers. The Standard scan targets more files, ignor-
ing extensions but still limiting the scan to those file types that are usually 
associated with viruses. Finally, the Thorough scan scans everything and searches 
for every type of virus.
Once you have made your selections, click the Start scan button, and avast! 
will start doing exactly that—showing its progress within the same window. 
When the scan is complete, a small window will pop up telling you, ideally, that 
no viruses were found. When was the last time you got a message like that on 
your Windows machine?
Protecting yourself against Internet nasties is all well and good, but what if 
someone gains physical access to your computer? Data theft is a serious busi-
ness, so if you have any sensitive files, you should think about protecting them. 
A good way of doing this is to encrypt your sensitive files. Encryption is a way 
of taking a file and scrambling it in such a way that only a person with the 
right decryption key will be able to recover the original information. If someone 
tries to look at the file while it’s still encrypted, all they will be able to see is a 
bunch of nonsense characters.
19B-1: Creating an Encrypted File Folder
Ubuntu has a nice way of encrypting files, but you should take care when 
using it! The whole point of encrypting your files is that no one but you will 
be able to access them, so there’s little chance of recovering them if you for-
get your password. Here are the steps you need to follow to get encrypted:
1.
Open the Ubuntu Software Center, and search for and install ecryptfs-utils.
2.
Once installation has completed, open a Terminal by clicking Applica-
tionsAccessoriesTerminal, type ecryptfs-setup-private, and press 
ENTER.
3.
You’ll be prompted for the password that you use to log in to Ubuntu. 
Type it, and press ENTER. (The letters won’t show up on the screen, but 
that’s normal.)
4.
You’ll be asked to enter your mount passphrase (password). Pick some-
thing very memorable—there’s no recovering this password if you forget 
it! Press ENTER, retype the password (to make sure there were no typos), 
and press ENTER again.
5.
Close the Terminal window, log out of your user account, and log back 
in again.
6.
When you log in, an Update information window will appear (Figure 19-8). 
Click Run this action now, type your login password into the window that 
appears (it will look as if nothing is being typed again), and press ENTER.

349
7.
Your mount password (also referred to as encryption passphrase) will be 
displayed on the screen. Make a careful note of it, press ENTER, and then 
click Close in the Update information window to continue logging in.
Figure 19-8: Checking your encryption passphrase
If you open your home folder, you’ll now see a folder called Private. Any-
thing you put in this folder will be encrypted and will be safe from prying eyes. 
This is especially useful if your computer gets stolen—only someone with your 
mount password will be able to look at the files, and ideally the only person 
who knows it is you!
19B-2: Recovering Encrypted Files If Something Goes Wrong
If you have problems with your computer and need to recover the files in the 
encrypted Private directory, use the following steps after you get Ubuntu up 
and running again. If you don’t feel confident following these instructions, 
you should definitely ask for advice on the Ubuntu forums first.
1.
Open a Terminal, type sudo mount -t ecryptfs /home/username/.Private /home/
username/Private, and press ENTER. You should, of course, replace username 
with your own username.
2.
You’ll be asked for your passphrase. Type your mount passphrase (pass-
word), and press ENTER.
3.
Now you’ll be prompted a few times to make a section. Hit ENTER a few 
times until you’re given a WARNING message.
4.
Type yes, and press ENTER; then type no, and press ENTER.
5.
If you entered the right mount password, the Private folder will be 
decrypted, and you’ll be able to access your files. Copy them from that 
folder to somewhere safe!

Chapter 19
If you have no luck recovering your files, take a look at https://help
.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory/ to see whether there’s any-
thing further you can try.
Although most people are satisfied with deleting their files when they no 
longer need them, they may not realize that the deleted file data is still retriev-
able. This may pose little concern when it comes to photos of your summer 
trip to Maryland or reports you may have written for a class on Thai cooking, 
but it is a completely different situation if you’ve been storing bank details or 
other confidential information on your hard disk. Even if you reformat that 
disk, the data stays. That is great news if you want to retrieve any files you may 
have accidentally deleted (or formatted away), but it isn’t such good news if 
your computer gets lost or stolen or if you just decide to give it away. In such 
cases, it might not be a bad idea to do some digital shredding.
19C-1: Trying the shred Command
Digital shredding in Linux is done with the shred command. Its usage is very 
similar to the rm command you learned to use in Chapter 9, though in terms of 
removal, shred is much more thorough. To give it a try, create a dummy file by 
going to the File menu of a Nautilus window, and selecting Create Document
Empty File. Name the new document myShredExp.txt, and then double-click 
the file. This will open gedit. Type a couple of sentences in the document—any-
thing will do—and then save it. Close gedit. The first couple of words you 
typed should now appear on the icon of the new dummy file you created (as 
shown in the example on the left side of Figure 19-9).
Figure 19-9: Files change their 
appearances after being shredded.
With your new file in hand and placed in your home folder to make it 
easier to follow along, you are ready to try shred. Open a Terminal window, 
type shred myShredExp.txt, and then press ENTER. If you now look in your home 
folder, you will notice the difference right away: Your original file is still there, 
but the text on the icon now looks like gibberish (as you can see in the example 
on the right side of Figure 19-8), which is what your file has become. If you 
double-click the file, gedit will open like it did before, but this time around, it 
won’t be able to read your file, and it will tell you so (Figure 19-10).

Figure 19-10: gedit can’t open your shredded files.
So, now you’ve got yourself a shredded file sitting in your folder, but it 
sure would be handy to get rid of the file rather than just have it sitting 
there littering things up, wouldn’t it? Of course, you can remove the file via 
the Terminal by using the rm command, but it would be easier to get future 
shredded files deleted immediately after being shredded. Fortunately, this is 
easy enough to do by using the shred command with the -u flag. You can try it 
on the file you’ve already shredded by opening a Terminal window, typing 
shred -u myShredExp.txt, and then pressing ENTER. Your file will then be fur-
ther shredded and deleted.
19C-2: Taking the shred Command Graphical in Nautilus
Although using the shred command isn’t all that difficult, most average users 
would prefer to do things graphically. After all, you don’t have to type com-
mands to delete or move a file, right? You can do all of that easily enough 
through Nautilus, and it’s the same with shred. The only difference is that 
shred’s functionality does not come bundled into Nautilus out of the box—
you have to add it yourself. Here are the steps you need to follow:
1.
From the Ubuntu Software Center, search for nautilus-actions, and install 
Nautilus Actions Configuration. This package allows you to add commands 
and other functionality to Nautilus.
2.
Once the installation is complete, select SystemPreferencesNautilus 
Actions Configuration.
3.
When the Nautilus Actions windows appears, click the Add button.

352
Chapter 19
4.
In the Add a New Action window that appears, type Shred in the Label 
box and Erase files more securely in the Tooltip box.
5.
If you want to choose an icon for your Shred menu entry in Nautilus, click 
the arrow button to the left of the Browse button, and then select an icon 
of your choosing (I just used the delete icon). When you’re finished, your 
window should look like that in Figure 19-11.
Figure 19-11: Making the shred command graphical via Nautilus
6.
Next, click the Command tab, and type shred in the Path box, and -f -u 
-v -z %M in the Parameters box (making sure you use an uppercase M).
7.
Now click the Conditions tab. In the Appears if selection contains section 
of that tab, choose whether you want the new Shred menu to appear only 
when you have selected a file, only when you’ve selected a folder, or both. 
To play it safe at first, you might want to stick with the default, Only files, 
so you don’t inadvertently shred a whole folder full of important files. Once 
done, check the Appears if selection has multiple files or folders box, 
and then save your work by going to the File menu and selecting Save.
8.
The label for the shred command in the left pane of the still-open Nautilus 
Actions window will now no longer be in italics. Click the Close button in 
that window.

To put shred to work in its new graphical manifestation, you must first log 
out and log back in to your account. After, that just right-click a file you want 
to shred, and then select Shred from the pop-up menu (Figure 19-12). The 
file will be securely, and permanently, deleted. Decidedly cool.

The Ubuntu Community
One thing that really sets open source 
apart from the commercial software world 
is the importance placed on the community. 
This can include pretty much anyone who has 
anything to do with the software: The people who use 
it, the people who design it, the people who help others 
with problems . . . every last one of them is a valued 
community member.
Consider the commercial software world, where things tend to be quite 
top-down. When you have a problem, you go to some company that provides 
you with support. This company probably also designed and sold you the 
software, and you probably played no part in that process—you’re the customer; 
they’re the vendor. Open source is different: Rather than one business man-
aging everything, everyone pitches in together and helps each other. People 
write software and fix faults because it helps other people and because they 
want to help. Everyone can play their part in offering feedback and suggestions 
and helping others with problems, and no one is in absolute control of the 
whole process. All in all, it’s much more democratic and, in my opinion, much 
more fun!

356
Chapter 20
The Ubuntu community in particular is large, vibrant, and notoriously 
friendly. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to get the most out of it and how 
you can play your part by joining in and giving something back (if you like).
Take Me to Your SABDFL
Open source communities tend to have a well-defined structure, and Ubuntu 
is no exception. At the top of the pile is Ubuntu’s founder, Mark Shuttleworth, 
whom you met in Chapter 1. He’s the Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator 
For Life (SABDFL), and according to http://www.ubuntu.com/community/
ubuntustory/governance/, his role is to “provide clear leadership on difficult 
issues and set the pace for the project.” This doesn’t mean that he makes all 
of the plans and decisions—that’s more the job of the Technical Board, a 
group of senior Ubuntu contributors who figure out what shape the next 
Ubuntu release will take. Mark is just there to step in if no one can agree.
There’s also the Community Council, which oversees the teams of con-
tributors that make up the bulk of the project. There are lots of teams with 
all sorts of responsibilities: The Documentation Team writes the documenta-
tion for each release of Ubuntu, the Installer Team looks after the software 
used for installing Ubuntu, and so on. You can find a list of them at https://
wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams/. Teams consist of members from all over the world 
(Figure 20-1), and people on the team may have all sorts of responsibilities: 
Developers, for example, are the people who write and update the software. 
Last, but certainly not least, are the millions of Ubuntu users worldwide who 
form the biggest part of the community. This group includes you!

Everyone who participates is expected to abide by the Code of Conduct 
(http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/), and people who make changes 
to the project (like developers) are asked to sign a copy of this document to 
show their commitment to the principles of Ubuntu. One final note: Ubuntu 
is a meritocracy, where the people who’ve contributed most to the project get the 
biggest say. The most prolific contributors are awarded with Ubuntu membership 
(if they apply for it) and benefit from such perks as an ubuntu.com email address.
Launchpad: Your Passport to the Ubuntu Community
Every open source software project needs a place to call home. In Ubuntu’s 
case, this is Launchpad, a sort of project information website on steroids. 
Whether you want to report a problem, ask for help, design a cool new fea-
ture, or write your own program, Launchpad is where you go.
Fire up Firefox, and browse to http://www.launchpad.net/. Unless you’ve 
signed up before, you’ll want to register for an account, so click Log in / 
Register at the top of the page, and answer the questions under the “Not reg-
istered yet?” heading. Hit Register, and go check your email for details on 
how to finish signing up. When the message arrives, click the first link, fill in 
your details, and click Continue on the page you get sent to so you can start 
using your account.
Once that’s all done and dusted, click your name in the top right of the 
page to see your profile. It’s probably looking pretty empty at the moment, 
apart from a bunch of three-letter acronyms and a mysterious invitation to 
change your “branding.” Click one of the round, yellow pencil icons to start 
changing your details. You can put as much or as little information on your 
account as you want—for example, if you’d like people to be able to find you 
on IRC (see “Chatting on IRC” on page 367), make sure you enter your nick-
name on the page (Figure 20-2). Otherwise, you can leave most things blank.
If you’ve just created your account, you might notice a sad little zero 
hanging around in the “Karma” section. Fortunately, it’s not karma of the 
metaphysical sort, and your eternal soul isn’t in any danger. Rather, it’s a 
points system for recognizing people who have helped make Ubuntu better. 
The more you contribute, the more karma points you get, and hence the 
greater your bragging rights over your Ubuntu-obsessed friends (that’s all of 
them, right?). Check out https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/Karma/ for 
details on how it all works.

Bugs, Bugs, Glorious Bugs
The computers of yesteryear were enormous, complicated beasts, filling 
entire rooms with delicate electronics and whirring tape drives. Renowned 
computer scientist Grace Hopper, on retrieving a moth from a relay in one 
such giant, taped the offending insect into her log book and remarked that 
she had found a “bug” in the computer. Well, computers may have changed 
a lot since the 1940s, but some of the terminology hasn’t. Whether it’s as 
major as a program crashing or freezing or as minor as a missing icon, any 
problem that you find with a piece of software is still referred to as a bug.
You’ve almost certainly come across a bug before—no software, whether 
commercial or open source, is ever perfect. The difference with open source 
is that you’re strongly encouraged to report problems wherever you see them. 
Developers need feedback in the form of bug reports so they know what needs 
fixing, and problems get fixed more quickly if they’re reported sooner. Filing 
a bug report is a relatively easy way of giving something back to the commu-
nity; it doesn’t take long, it helps to improve the software for everyone, and 
you get an annoying software problem fixed for free!
What Counts as a Bug?
There are lots of different types of bug, but you can usually fit them into one 
of the following categories:
z
When a program crashes, freezes, or shows an error message for no good 
reason (for example, Figure 20-3)
z
When something doesn’t work (for example, when a button does nothing 
when you click it)

A Colony of Penguins
359
z
When hardware (such as a printer or your sound card) misbehaves or 
doesn’t work at all
z
Typos, missing icons, and other cosmetic mistakes
If your problem fits any of these descriptions, then you likely have a bug 
on your hands! You should be aware of a few notable exceptions, though. First, 
if a program is missing a feature, that’s not a bug. You can make a feature 
request using the Brainstorm website (see “Sharing Ideas on How to Improve 
Ubuntu” on page 364). Second, you shouldn’t ask for help with software by 
reporting a bug, since you probably won’t get a response. Use the forums or 
IRC instead; find out more on those in “The Ubuntu Forums” on page 365 
and “Chatting on IRC” on page 367. Finally, it’s important that the bug is 
reproducible. This means that you can provide a set of instructions for someone 
else to follow, and they will experience the same problem as you. Sometimes 
computers just do one-off weird things, so if it’s not repeatable, there’s little 
chance that the problem can be identified and fixed.
Figure 20-3: If a program crashes (like Gwibber here), it’s 
probably a bug
Reporting a Bug
If you’re confident you’ve found a bug, it’s time to tell someone about it! If it 
happened in a specific program, select HelpReport a Problem in that pro-
gram’s menu, if that option exists, and skip to the next paragraph. If that 
option isn’t there, you’ll have to get your hands a little dirty. First you need 
to find the command name for the offending program. This isn’t always the 
same as the name that appears in the title of the window, so you’ll have to do 
some digging to make sure you get it right:
1.
Select SystemPreferencesMain Menu to open the menu editor.
2.
Use the Menus list to the left of the window to find your program. For 
example, if you want to report a bug about the Tomboy note-taking pro-
gram, you’d click the Accessories item and find Tomboy Notes in the Items 
list in the middle of the screen.
3.
Right-click the name of your program, and choose Properties from the 
menu that pops up.

When the Launcher Properties window appears, take a look at the con-
tents of the Command box—for Tomboy it should say tomboy --search 
(Figure 20-4). You can ignore everything after the first space (only the first 
part matters)—so in this case, the program’s command name is tomboy.

(replacing tomboy with the command name for your program), and click 
Run.
Figure 20-4: Finding the command name for Tomboy
The bug-reporting tool will start and collect some information about the 
program (such as what version you’re using). Next, it’ll ask whether you want 
to send this report to the developers—you do, so click Send Report, and a 
web page will open (log in to Launchpad if you haven’t done so already). 
Type a brief description of your problem, being as specific as possible, and 
click Next.
Has It Already Been Reported?
Lots of people are using the same programs as you, so there’s a good chance 
that someone has gone to the trouble of reporting your bug already. Launchpad 
will go off to look for existing bugs that it thinks match the description you 
gave, so take a look at the list that appears and see whether any of the results 
sound familiar (Figure 20-5). If you find one that does, click the arrow next 
to it, read the description to make sure, and click Yes, this is the bug I’m 
trying to report. This could be a good sign, because someone just might be 
working on a fix already!
Choose Just mark the bug as affecting me, and click the green check button 
to go straight to the bug page (the alternative option, Subscribe me as well, 
means that you will receive an email every time someone posts a comment 
about the bug). Take a look at the comments that others have made about 
the bug, and see whether there’s anything useful that could help you work 
around the problem. Comments are sometimes technical in nature, so it 
might be necessary to ask around on the forums for help with some of the 
more cryptic instructions. If you can’t see anything helpful, you can try to 
provide some more details on the problem to help a developer track it down. 
They often ask for you to provide a copy of the output of some command,

which they can use to figure out what’s going wrong. If you think you can 
help, scroll down to the bottom of the bug page, and put what you know in 
the comment box.

A New Bug
If no one else seems to have the same problem, then you’ve got a live one! 
Click No, I need to report a new bug at the bottom of the page where the list 
of suggested bugs appeared, and write a description of the bug in the Further 
information box. Here are some tips on how to write a breathtakingly beauti-
ful bug report:
Only report one problem per bug. If you report more than one problem 
at a time, it will be difficult for the developers to keep track of what they’ve 
fixed and what they haven’t.
Describe what you were doing at the time the bug occurred. Context is 
important, so you should describe what you were doing when you experi-
enced the problem. For example, if your music player crashed when you 
plugged in your iPod, then you should mention that.
Mention which version of the program you’re using. The bug-reporting 
tool should have automatically provided information about software 
versions, but it’s a good idea to make a note of them yourself too. Selecting 
HelpAbout in the program’s menu will usually give you the version 
number of the program, and you can find out which Ubuntu version 
you’re running by selecting SystemAbout Ubuntu.

362
Chapter 20
Describe how to reproduce the bug. Developers need to see how the bug 
happens in order to fix it. Provide a step-by-step list of instructions that 
describe how someone could make the same problem happen on their 
computer. If you don’t know how to make the bug happen again, just 
describe in as much detail what you clicked or changed when the bug 
happened.
Once you’ve packed the report with information, click Submit Bug Report 
to finish the process.
What Happens Now?
You’ll receive an email from Launchpad confirming that your bug was reported 
successfully, but this isn’t the end of the story. Let’s take a look at a typical 
bug to see how things pan out: Open Firefox, and head over to https://bugs
.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/121853/ to see a bug I reported for the Rhythm-
box music player in 2007. The first thing to note is the information at the top 
of the page (Figure 20-6): The Affects column lists which packages are affected 
by the bug, Status tells you how far the bug has made it on the road to being 
fixed, Importance tells you how serious the bug is, and Assigned to is the name 
of the developer or team responsible for fixing the bug. These details are 
changed by developers as progress is made on identifying and fixing the 
problem.
Figure 20-6: The Launchpad bug report page for my Rhythmbox bug
NOTE
It’s bad practice to change the status or importance of your own bug since people often 
overestimate the importance of their problem. Leave it up to an Ubuntu developer or 
another community member.

A Colony of Penguins
363
Further down, you’ll see my original bug report followed by a question 
from superstar Ubuntu developer Sebastien Bacher. There’s a bit more to-
and-fro until the bug gets sent upstream—that is, to a different open source 
project that handles the bugs for Rhythmbox. From there, I just had to wait 
for the Rhythmbox developers to fix the problem.
If you’ve reported a bug, keep an eye on your email. You’ll be notified 
every time the bug is changed or a comment is made. If someone asks for 
more information on the problem (like Sebastien did with mine), all you 
need to do is reply to the email. Your reply will be automatically added to the 
bug report for everyone to see. The more information the developers have, 
the faster they will be able to fix the problem.
When Will My Bug Be Fixed?
Hundreds of new bugs are reported for Ubuntu every day, which isn’t so sur-
prising when you think that there are something like 30,000 packages avail-
able for you to install. The sheer volume of bugs isn’t easy to cope with, and 
dealing with them has been likened to “drinking from a firehose.” To calm 
the chaos, an army of volunteers called the Bug Squad pore over all the new 
bugs, categorizing them, identifying ones that have already been reported, 
asking for details on how the bug happens, and generally trying to get enough 
information together for a developer to be able to swoop in and fix the issue. 
In practical terms, this means it can take quite a while for a problem to be 
fixed, although the actual timescale will depend on how important the bug is 
judged to be. I normally reckon on waiting two to three months for an “aver-
age” bug. Having said that, my Rhythmbox bug hasn’t been fixed yet, and it’s 
several years later! (To be fair, it was a particularly minor problem that few 
people are ever likely to experience.)
Once a bug is fixed, its status is changed to Fix Released, and the Ubuntu 
developers will often provide an updated package that you can install to fix 
the problem on your computer. Fixes aren’t made available straightaway, since 
they have to go through a series of stringent tests to make sure that they don’t 
screw up anything else. This means that some bug fixes might not even be 
available until the next version of Ubuntu is released!
Faster Fixes
If you know that a problem has been fixed but an updated package hasn’t 
been released yet, there may be a way around the delay—if you don’t mind 
taking a small risk. When updates are being tested to get them ready for offi-
cial release, they are made available online for anyone to try. There’s a chance 
that the updated versions could cause problems (after all, they’re being tested!), 
but they’re usually fine. There are also backported packages, which are unoffi-
cially updated versions of programs. These will have been tested, just not very 
rigorously, so use these at your own risk too.
To gain access to these less-stable packages, select SystemAdmin-
istrationSoftware Sources, and click the Updates tab. Make sure that 
Proposed updates and Unsupported updates are checked (as in Figure 20-7), 

364
Chapter 20
and click Close. You’ll be greeted by a message saying that the information 
about available software is outdated, so hit Reload, and the new information 
will be downloaded. Once that’s finished, select SystemAdministration
Update Manager to see which packages can be updated.
Figure 20-7: Using the Software Sources tool to enable proposed and unsupported updates
WARNING 
You really do need to be careful when using untested updates. One package that com-
monly causes problems is the Linux kernel itself—scroll down the list of packages in 
Update Manager, and look for the “Proposed updates” section, if there is one. If you 
find a package that has a name like linux or linux-generic in there, consider 
unchecking the box next to it to prevent it from being updated for the time being.
Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu
Have you ever sat in front of your computer and thought, “This would work 
better if . . .” but dismissed the idea because you had no one to tell? Bring 
forth your best brainwaves: Ubuntu has a place for visionaries like you. It’s 
called Brainstorm, and it’s where you can share your ideas about how you’d 
like to see things change in the next release of Ubuntu. Head over to http://
brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ to see what I’m talking about. The theory is that you write 
a description of your awesome idea, and other people vote on how important 
they think it is or whether they think some other plan would work better.
You have to log in to the site to be able to participate. Unfortunately, you 
can’t sign in using your Launchpad username but must create a new account 
by clicking Log in at the top of the page and then filling in the Create new 
account tab.

365
There are thousands of submissions already on the site, and you can see 
a list of the most popular ones right there on the Brainstorm front page. If 
you find something compelling, just click the green arrow next to it to vote 
for it (or click the red arrow to register your disapproval). Of course, you can 
put your own ideas up there too: From the front page, click Submit your 
idea, and follow the instructions onscreen.
What happens to all of these ideas? A really good, popular idea might find 
its way to an Ubuntu developer who wants to turn it into reality, but there are 
no guarantees this will happen. Click the Implemented ideas link at the top 
of the Brainstorm page to see which submissions got picked up recently—
chances are there won’t be many. It’s not the end of the world if an idea doesn’t 
get adopted officially, though. The Ubuntu community is bursting with people 
who’re willing to have a go at writing software, so somebody might see your 
idea and put it into practice.
The Ubuntu Forums
An online forum is a place where you can post messages about some topic that 
other forum users can read and respond to publicly. There are thousands of 
forums on the Web, bringing people from all over the world together to talk 
about all sorts of stuff. The Ubuntu forums are a great place to ask questions, 
get help, and converse with other people using Ubuntu. There are around 
50,000 active users, and more than a million posts have been made to date. If 
you do have a question, there’s a good chance that it’s already been answered 
somewhere or that someone will be able answer it for you.
Dust off your explorer’s hat, and let’s go take a look around the forums. 
Head over to http://www.ubuntuforums.org/, and the first thing you’ll notice is 
that there are lots of different categories on the front page. Choosing the 
right category is pretty straightforward—people seeking help with computer 
problems will post their questions in one of the Main Support categories, for 
example. For now, let’s check out the part of the forum set aside for new 
THE HACKER CULTURE—A BRIEF ASIDE
If Linus Torvalds hadn’t shared his hobby project with the world, we wouldn’t be 
here talking about Ubuntu, or any form of Linux (see Chapter 1 if you have no idea 
what I’m talking about). The open source movement is founded on the hard work 
and ingenuity of people like Linus, who are affectionately known by the community 
as hackers. By this I vehemently don’t mean the people who break into computers, 
write horrible computer viruses, or otherwise spoil the party for everyone. There’s an 
alternative usage of the term hacker that goes much further back in computing history: 
Put simply, it means someone who writes computer programs as a pastime. The guys 
who founded Microsoft and Apple were hackers—enthusiasts playing around with 
early desktop computers in their respective garages.
The hacker culture extends beyond computers to all sorts of activities. It’s about 
experimenting, coming up with cool ideas, and then sharing them amongst similar-
minded people, and it’s this philosophy that has made the open source movement 
possible.

Ubuntu users. Click the Absolute Beginner Talk link, and scroll down to the 
bit that says Sticky Threads (Figure 20-8).
A thread is a collection of messages about the same topic. You can post 
replies to existing threads or start new threads yourself. A sticky thread is one 
that the forum moderators (the head honchos who make sure everything 
runs smoothly) deem important enough that they should stick around per-
manently, for everyone to read. Normal threads don’t stick around and slowly 
make their way down the list as new threads are started and added to the top. 
To read a thread, just click its name.
Figure 20-8: Viewing the sticky threads in the Absolute Beginner Talk forum
There are so many threads on the forums that sifting through them man-
ually would take a lifetime. Luckily, there’s a pretty good search feature. Just 
click the Search button at the top of the page, type some search terms in the 
box that appears, and click Go to see what turns up.
Replying to a Post
You can read any of the threads on the forums without a user account, but you 
do need to be logged in to reply to one of them. Click the Register link at the 
top of the page to create an account. You’ll need to click through a couple of 
pages, entering your details as you go, but it should be quite straightforward. 
Click Complete Registration when you’re finished, and go check your email. 
Once the confirmation email arrives, click the first link that it contains to finish 
setting up your account, and log in using the form at the top right of the page.
Now that you’re logged in, find the thread you want to reply to, and click 
the New Reply button at the top (or bottom) of the page. Type your message, 
click Submit Reply, and your post will be added to the end of the thread. If you 

A Colony of Penguins
367
realize that you made a mistake in your reply, you can go back to the thread and 
click the small EDIT button in the bottom-right corner of your post.
Creating Your Own Thread
If you search through the forums but can’t find anything relevant to your 
problem, why not create a new thread? The first step is to find the category 
that best fits the topic you want to discuss. Head back to the forum front 
page, and browse through the list until you find something that looks suitable. 
If you have a burning question about your wireless connection, for example, 
you’d click the Networking & Wireless category under the “Main Support 
Categories” heading.
Once you’ve found a category, click its name to view all of the threads it 
contains. Click the New Thread button at the top of the page to start writing. 
Make sure that you choose a descriptive title for your new thread, and include 
plenty of details if you’re asking a question about a problem you’re having. 
To finish off, click Submit New Thread, and wait for the replies to roll in!
What’s All This Bean Business?
You might have noticed a lot of talk about coffee and beans on your travels 
through the forums. Don’t worry, you haven’t wandered into a caffeine 
addiction support group—beans are just a way of keeping track of how many 
posts a person has made. (It’s supposedly an inside joke, referring to geeks’ 
love of coffee, but personally I can’t stand the stuff!) You’re given a bean for 
every reply or thread you make, and as you collect more beans, you’ll find 
that the description that appears under your name will change. As of this 
writing, I’m informed that my beans are green, with the chances of my ever 
becoming an “Ultimate Coffee Grinder” looking slimmer by the day.
Chatting on IRC
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is the where Ubuntu users can go to talk to one 
another online. Chats happen in real time and are very similar to using an 
instant messaging service. They’re particularly good if you can’t wait for a reply 
on the forums and want to talk to someone ASAP about a question you have.
IRC can be daunting at first, so let’s walk through a typical session. First, 
you’ll need to make sure you have the right chat software. Open the Ubuntu 
Software Center, search for XChat IRC (not to be mistaken for XChat-GNOME), 
and install it. Once you’ve done that, limber up your clicking finger, and fol-
low these steps:
1.
Select ApplicationsInternetXChat IRC to start XChat. A Network 
List window like the one in Figure 20-9 will appear.
2.
Make a few choices for your nickname. Your nickname is how other 
users will be able to identify you, so choose something that befits your 
uniqueness (mine is philbull). You should try a few alternatives in case 

368
Chapter 20
someone has already used your first choice—adding random numbers to 
the end of your first choice seems to work well. Just make sure not to use 
spaces in your nickname.
3.
Make sure that Ubuntu Servers is selected in the Networks list, and then 
click Connect.
4.
A load of text will flash across the screen as you are connected to the 
IRC server. After a few seconds, you’ll be switched over into the #ubuntu 
channel.
Figure 20-9: XChat’s Network List window
Don’t panic if things look confusing; you’ll figure it all out now. Call it a 
crash course in IRC!
A channel is just a place where you can go to talk to other people. There 
are lots of them on IRC, each one dedicated to a different topic. In XChat 
there is a list of channels that you’re connected to in the pane on the left side 
of the window, so you should be able to see that you’re currently in #ubuntu, 
which is for general Ubuntu help and support. You could select ServerJoin 
a Channel to connect to a different one, but for now there’s no need, since 
we’re already in the right channel. In the right pane is a list of other users 
who are currently connected to the same channel; #ubuntu is very popular, so 
there are probably quite a few of them!
When you entered the channel, a bunch of messages will have passed by 
in the pane in the center of the screen. The first few are automated messages 
that describe what the channel is for, set some ground rules, and so forth, 
but by now you should see messages from other people scrolling up the 
screen too (Figure 20-10). The nickname of the person talking is to the left 

A Colony of Penguins
369
of the vertical dividing line, and their message is on the right. Everyone in 
the channel can see the same messages, and there are typically several con-
versations going on at once. You’ll also see messages in different colors when 
someone joins or leaves the channel. People are coming and going all of the 
time, so you can just ignore these messages.
Figure 20-10: Other users chatting in the #ubuntu IRC channel
If you want to send a message, type it into the message box next to your 
nickname at the bottom of the screen, and press ENTER. You’ll see your message 
appear in the center pane, and so will everyone else who’s in the #ubuntu 
channel. All you have to do then is wait for a reply . . . .
Registering Your Nickname
It’s a good idea to register your nickname so nobody else can steal it and so 
people will recognize you the next time you use IRC. In the pane on the left of 
the window, click the freenode item to switch to a welcome channel for Freen-
ode, the IRC server used by Ubuntu (Figure 20-11). Now, type /ns register 
password email into the message box, replacing email with your email address 
and password with a good password. For example, typing /ns register nopeeking 
joe@example.com would do the trick if those were your details. Press ENTER to 
finish the registration.
If everything went according to plan, you’ll see a message saying some-
thing like An email containing nickname activation instructions has been sent 
to joe@example.com. Check your email, and there should be an activation email 
containing instructions to type something like /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER 
nickname jeaxzqxmgzqv into the Freenode channel you were in earlier. Do this, 

370
Chapter 20
and you should see a message along the lines of -NickServ- nickname has now 
been verified. That’s it, you’ve registered! Click the #ubuntu channel in the 
left pane to return to where you were before.
Figure 20-11: Registering your IRC nickname
If you got a message saying nickname is already registered instead of the 
one about an activation email, someone has already registered the nickname 
you’re using. In this case, type /nick newname, replacing newname with a new 
choice of nickname, and press ENTER. You’ll see a message that says You are 
now known as newname. Ideally no one else has the same name this time, so try to 
register again.
 The next time you go on IRC, you can retrieve your registered nickname 
by going to the freenode channel, typing /nick nickname, and pressing ENTER. 
Then type /msg NickServ identify password, and press ENTER again. Of course, 
replace nickname and password with your own nickname and password.
IRC Etiquette
There are rules and social norms to follow on IRC just like anywhere else. It 
goes without saying that you shouldn’t go out of your way to offend or harass 
anyone, just as you wouldn’t in the “real world.” There are a few more subtle 
conventions that you should be aware of, though:
Don’t shout. Writing in ALL CAPITALS is the IRC equivalent of shouting 
all the time. There’s a special circle of hell for shouters; this is pretty much 
everyone’s pet peeve, and you’re bound to get censured for doing it.
Say things only once. Sometimes you won’t get a reply for a while, so it can 
be tempting to keep repeating the same message until someone acknowl-
edges it. Repeating yourself too many times is also considered annoying. 
Being patient is a necessary skill on IRC because people tend to dip in and 

A Colony of Penguins
371
out of chats sporadically rather than watching them all of the time. It’s 
OK to repeat your message if you don’t get a reply after 10 minutes or 
so, though.
Don’t send loads of text. Sending more than a few lines of text at once is 
called flooding. It makes it difficult for other people to have a conversa-
tion, so you should avoid doing it. If you have lots of text that you want 
people to read, use a service like http://pastebin.com/ to hold the text, and 
simply post a link to it on IRC.
Stay on-topic. There are different channels for different purposes, so you 
should try to stick to the topic for which a particular channel is intended. 
Advertising is considered to be off-topic in most channels and is particu-
larly frowned upon.
Smile for the camera. Most of the conversations in the public Ubuntu 
chat rooms are logged and can be viewed at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/. 
This is useful if you forgot a link that someone mentioned last week, but 
it can be awkward if you said something that you shouldn’t. As a general 
rule, never post any sensitive or personal information on IRC (especially 
your password or credit card details), because it could come back to bite 
you in the posterior.
More Help with IRC
I hope this first expedition into IRC hasn’t put you off for life. Lots of people 
find it confusing at first, but it’s a really great way to talk to other Ubuntu 
users once you’re comfortable with it. If you feel like you need to hone your 
IRC skills, the IRC Help website at http://www.irchelp.org/ is a very useful resource.
An IRC Alternative: Mailing Lists
If you can’t get the hang of IRC, there’s another, more gentle, option available 
to you in the form of the support mailing lists. All you need to do is send an 
email to the appropriate list and hope for a reply. Visit https://lists.ubuntu.com/ 
to see your options—the ubuntu-users list is probably the one you want.
Keeping Up with the News
If you want to find out what’s going on in Ubuntu-land, there’s no shortage 
of news outlets. Here are just a few of them (you’ll also find additional 
resources in Appendix D):
Full Circle Magazine (http://fullcirclemagazine.org/): Full Circle is an inde-
pendently produced Ubuntu magazine that is free to download in PDF. 
It contains everything you might expect to find in a traditional dead-tree 
magazine, such as reviews, interviews, stories from readers, and handy 
how-to guides.

372
Chapter 20
Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/): 
The UWN aims to provide an overview of the goings-on in the community 
each week and typically includes notable Ubuntu news stories, interviews 
with developers, and updates on recent changes to software. It’s pitched 
at the geekier end of the spectrum.
The Fridge (http://fridge.ubuntu.com/): The Fridge is a place where peo-
ple in the community can stick notes and updates on upcoming events. 
Interviews are sometimes posted here too.
Planet Ubuntu (http://planet.ubuntu.com/): This is where you can read 
the personal blogs of Ubuntu developers. Some of the posts are techni-
cal, but if you’re interested in cutting-edge developments, this is where 
you need to go.
News and opinion get passed around on microblogging services too. 
Subscribe to the #ubuntu hashtag on Twitter, or join the Ubuntu group on 
Identi.ca (http://identi.ca/group/ubuntu/) to join in the tweeting, denting, or 
whatever you want to call it.
LoCos and LUGs
So far, the whole Ubuntu community thing might seem a bit, well, virtual to 
you. Why shouldn’t it? Ubuntu is a very international venture, and communi-
cating online is the most practical way of getting things done. Regardless, there 
are plenty of opportunities to contact and meet other Ubuntu users in your 
area through Local Community (LoCo) teams and Linux User Groups (LUGs). 
These groups often have a membership with diverse computing skills, so they 
can be a good place to go to get help with Linux, among other things.
LoCos tend to cover reasonably large geographic areas, normally on the 
scale of whole countries or states. As such, they tend to meet in person less 
regularly, although many LoCos arrange Ubuntu-related events throughout 
the year, including “launch parties” around the time of each Ubuntu release. 
You can find a list of LoCo teams at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList/.
LUGs are much more widespread than LoCos and tend to have a greater 
emphasis on meeting up. Typically, a LUG will hold regular meetings in a 
local community center (a pub, if you’re lucky) and might organize talks or 
other Linux-related activities. You can find your nearest LUG at http://
www.linux.org/groups/.
Stickers and Other Goodies
If you have a penchant for showing off your Ubuntu addiction, then you’re 
in luck! Free stickers are available from Ubuntu-friendly computer manufac-
turer system76, and they’re just great for replacing the unsightly Windows 
logo that you probably have hiding somewhere on your computer’s case

(see Figure 20-12). To order yours, browse to http://www.system76.com/
article_info.php?articles_id=9, and send a stamped, addressed envelope to the 
relevant address on that page. No club would be complete without a mem-
bership badge, would it?
If stickers leave you cold, other Ubuntu-branded goodies are available 
for purchase through the Canonical Store (http://shop.canonical.com/).

Getting Involved
Lots of people enjoy being part of the Ubuntu community and want to give 
something back by volunteering to help. Reporting bugs and using Brainstorm 
are great ways of making a contribution, but that’s only the start of it!
If you talk to existing contributors, you’ll soon see that everyone’s story is 
different. I stumbled into contributing to Ubuntu in early 2006, when I started 
tidying up some bug reports that were missing information. It was something 
to pass the time and took up about half an hour per day. This was back when 
Launchpad was new and all the bugs were being transferred from the old 
system, so the work was pretty fun. The members of the Bug Squad were 
incredibly encouraging, and I soon found myself spending more and more 
time doing Ubuntu stuff. As time went on, I started editing help pages on the 
wiki (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/) and eventually found my way to the 
Documentation Team, where I coauthored a guide on switching from Windows 
to Ubuntu. Nowadays I’m one of the maintainers of the official help files, 
among other things. Being a contributor has been a great experience—I’ve 
met tons of interesting new people, indulged my interests in writing and 
computers, traveled to conferences around the world, and, most impor-
tantly, had tons of fun in the process.
Browse to http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ to get some ideas on how 
you might be able to help. You don’t need to be a geek to get involved: Artists, 
writers, multilinguists, marketers . . . the list of ways to participate just goes 
on. You can even attend a conference and have as much fun as the contribu-
tors in Figure 20-13! To get started, all you need to do is join the relevant 

374
Chapter 20
team and introduce yourself on their mailing list. If you are interested, one 
thing in particular that you should look out for is Ubuntu OpenWeek, where 
all of the Ubuntu teams hold talks and tutorials on IRC. Check out https://
wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/ to see when the next one will be.

Fixing Common Problems
Like death and taxes, computer problems 
are an inescapable fact of life. Ubuntu suffers 
from its fair share of annoyances, and although I 
seem to spend far less time fixing things on Ubuntu 
than I ever used to on Windows, it’s best not to ignore 
the possibility that you might some day experience a 
hardware hiccup or sticky software situation.
The purpose of this chapter is to arm you with some general-purpose 
tips, tricks, and troubleshooting hints. You’ll find explicit instructions on 
how to fix several specific problems, but for the most part I’ve tried to keep 
the discussion general. This is because the way you resolve some issues will 
depend heavily on the peculiarities of your setup, and there just isn’t a book-
shelf big enough for a guide that covers every possible eventuality in suitable 
detail. Fortunately, the Internet harbors a sizable collection of Ubuntu-related 

376
Chapter 21
guides, so even if you don’t arrive at the exact answer you were looking for 
here, I hope you’ll be able to use some of my tips to help you find the right 
information on the Web.
If you’ve run into a problem, flip through this chapter to see whether 
there’s anything that might help. I’ve covered problems with installation, 
booting, sound and video, Internet and network connections, hard disks and 
storage, and displays and graphics cards, along with pesky software issues such 
as programs freezing or slowing down your computer. If you’re not beset by 
any particular computer quandary, you might like to skim through this chap-
ter to give you some idea of what to do if misfortune does befall you in the 
future. Or, you could take my preferred route: Make yourself a hot beverage 
and head back to the games chapter (Chapter 17) for some well-deserved 
R&R.
I Can’t Get Ubuntu Installed
Not being able to install Ubuntu is a particularly unhappy problem because it 
means that you’ve probably been denied all the fun from the previous 20 chap-
ters of this book! Never fear; there’s plenty you can do to convince Ubuntu to 
install itself on your computer, and if you’re still struggling, you can try alter-
native installation methods like booting from a USB stick, which I’ve covered 
in Appendix A.
My Computer Won’t Boot from the CD
If you tried to start your computer from the Ubuntu installation CD but never 
even got to the purple boot screen (see “Going for a Dip” on page 12) or if 
the computer just boots into Windows every time, try one of the following 
options:
Check the boot order
When your computer starts up (boots), it goes 
through a list of devices in a set order, checking to see whether they have 
an operating system on them. As soon as it finds an operating system, the 
computer will boot from that device, and it won’t check any of the other 
devices. This means that if the hard disk comes before the CD drive in 
the boot order, the computer will boot from the hard disk rather than the 
CD drive. To boot from the CD, you need to make sure that the CD drive 
comes first in the boot order. See “Going for a Dip” on page 12 for instruc-
tions on setting up the boot order correctly.
Check the integrity of the CD
You could have a faulty or damaged CD 
that your computer isn’t able to boot from. It’s possible to check whether 
a disc has faults on it by doing a checksum test. A checksum is sort of like a 
fingerprint; you take the checksum of your Ubuntu CD and compare it 
with the checksum of an Ubuntu CD that is known to be free of faults. If 
there is but one tiny difference between the two discs, the checksums will 
be different too—the fingerprints won’t match. Ubuntu uses the MD5SUM 

Wounded Wings
377
program to do its checksums. Go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/
HowToMD5SUM/, and scroll down to the “MD5SUM on Windows” sec-
tion to see how you can find the checksum of your disc. If it turns out that 
the checksums don’t match, you’ll need to get another CD (for example, 
by downloading a CD image from http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/
download/ or by contacting No Starch Press to ask for a replacement).
Make sure you burned the disc correctly
If you downloaded a CD image 
(.iso) file instead of using the CD that came with this book, make sure that 
you burned the CD correctly. A common mistake that people make is to 
just copy the .iso file onto a CD, as if it were a normal file. This won’t work; 
you need to use the Burn Disc Image option (or something similar) in 
your CD-burning software to do it properly. See https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/BurningIsoHowto/ for instructions on how to do this.
I Can’t Get the Installer to Run
If you can boot from the Ubuntu CD (so that the purple boot screen in Fig-
ure 21-1 is displayed) but when you choose to try or install Ubuntu, something 
goes wrong and you never get to the installer screen, the computer might be 
struggling to start some of the software required to run the live CD. You can 
try the following:
Try some kernel options
As soon as you get to the purple boot screen, 
press any key (my favorite is the spacebar), and choose your language 
from the list that appears by using the arrow keys and ENTER. Then, press 
F6 to open a little menu with a list of cryptic options (Figure 21-2). These 
are kernel options and can be used to turn off features that sometimes cause 
problems when you’re trying to start the computer. Use the arrow keys to 
go up and down the list and the ENTER key to select an option (an x will 
appear next to it). In the first instance, I recommend selecting acpi=off, 
noapic, nodmraid, and nomodeset. Then, press ESC to hide the menu, and try 
to boot from the CD normally by selecting one of the options in the main 
list and pressing ENTER. If that didn’t do anything, you might need to 
apply some good ol’ trial and error to the kernel options to find a combi-
nation that works for you.
Try an alternate CD/memory stick
Some computers are simply unable 
to run the live CD. An alternative text-based installation CD is available from 
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#alternate/; you’ll have to 
download the CD image (.iso) file yourself and burn it to a disc before you 
can use it (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto/ for 
details). This installation method isn’t as user-friendly as the graphical 
installation from the live CD, but it’s much more likely to work if you’re 
having problems. You could also try installing from a USB memory stick, 
as described in Appendix A.

The Installer Stops Partway Through
This is probably one of the most annoying problems you can encounter. You 
boot from the Ubuntu CD, go through all the pages of options described in 
Chapter 2, and then click Install to start installing Ubuntu. But, after all that, 
the installer doesn’t finish and gets stuck a few percent shy of 100.
There are lots of reasons why this might happen, most of which relate to 
misbehaving hardware. I’ve briefly described a few of the things you can try 
in this section, but because the underlying problem might be peculiar to 
the hardware in your computer, you will probably need to ask for help on the 
Ubuntu forums.
Wait for a while
Installation takes longer on some computers than others. 
There are many reasons why this could happen (such as problems getting 
hardware to work), but if you give it an extra 20 or 30 minutes, it might 
finish.
Disconnect from the Internet
If you are connected to the Internet, the 
installer might try to fetch extra settings or look for package updates while it 
is running. If something goes wrong when it tries to do this, it could stall, 
and the installation won’t finish. Restart your computer and boot from 
the live CD again, but this time make sure you disconnect from the Inter-
net before starting the installer.
Disconnect any unnecessary devices
Some computer hardware can 
confuse the installer just by being plugged in. Turn off your computer, 
and disconnect or switch off any devices that you don’t absolutely need 
to have attached. Printers, scanners, USB wireless cards, and external 
hard disks in particular should be disconnected. Then, start the computer, 
and attempt the installation again. Once installation is complete, you 
should be able to plug everything back in without any problems.
Check the integrity of the CD
If the CD has a fault on it, the installer 
might not be able to access something that it needs from the disc. See 
“My Computer Won’t Boot from the CD” on page 376 for advice on how 
to check the integrity of the CD.
Something Goes Wrong Before Ubuntu Finishes Booting
Boot problems are especially awkward—if Ubuntu won’t start, how can you 
access the software you need to fix the problem? To get around this particular 
annoyance, you might need to start the computer from a live CD (like the one 
included with this book) or use some special options to help the process along.
This section covers the two most common classes of boot problems, GRUB 
errors and kernel problems. There’s some general advice for other types of 
boot problem too, including tips for dual-booters struggling to get Windows 
to start.

380
Chapter 21
I Get a GRUB Error
When you try to start your computer, you might be left with a black screen, 
which says that there was a GRUB error. This means there is a problem with 
the GRUB bootloader, which is responsible for telling your computer’s hard-
ware how to start Ubuntu. Fixing these errors tends to involve typing a few 
cryptic-looking commands or booting off a live CD, so be prepared for that. 
You can find a short guide to handling common GRUB errors at https://
help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#GRUB%20Errors/.
I Get a Kernel Panic or the Computer Freezes
Kernel panics have a scary name for a reason. If you get an error message 
saying that there was a kernel panic, something pretty serious went wrong in 
Linux-land, and you’ll probably find that you can’t use the computer until 
you fix the problem. Fortunately, such errors are rare, and even if you do get 
one, you should be able to fix it without too much work. I should also note 
that kernel panics are only serious in that they make it difficult to run soft-
ware on the computer—the physical hardware side of your computer won’t 
be damaged at all, so once you get the software working again, everything 
will be back to normal. So really, there’s no need to panic at all.
Freezes and kernel panics often go hand in hand, but they’re not neces-
sarily the same thing. You’ve probably seen a computer freeze up before—
moving the mouse or pressing keys on the keyboard does nothing, and the 
display stays frozen. If the computer freezes, all you can do is give it a minute 
or two to see whether it wakes up and, if not, restart the computer or turn it 
off by holding down the power button for a few seconds.
You can try a few things if you keep getting kernel panics or freezes, 
detailed in the following sections. If nothing seems to be working, ask for 
advice in the Ubuntu forums, and, with a bit of luck, you’ll soon be up and 
running again.
Unplug Unnecessary Hardware
A lot of freezes are caused by problems with hardware devices. If you recently 
bought some new hardware, try unplugging it and see whether you still get the 
freezes. If you recently installed some system updates, the driver for some 
hardware could be causing the problem too. It’s worth unplugging any unnec-
essary hardware (such as scanners, printers, external hard drives, and the like) 
to check whether they’re causing the problems.
Disable Restricted Drivers
Some freezes are caused by problems with accelerated graphics drivers (see 
“Games/Compiz Don’t Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers” on 
page 394) or restricted drivers for other hardware (see “Installing Drivers for 
Your Network/Wireless Card,” on page 390). If you suspect that this might 
be the case, disable the restricted drivers if you can. To do this, select 
SystemAdministrationHardware Drivers to open the Hardware Drivers 
tool (Figure 21-3). Select a currently activated driver, and click Remove. 
Then, restart the computer to see whether you experience any more freezes.

381
Figure 21-3: Using the Hardware Drivers tool to disable a restricted driver
Check Your System Memory for Defects
Your system memory (also known as RAM) is vital to the operation of your 
computer. It’s where all your programs (and Linux itself) store information 
when they’re running. If a fault develops in your system memory, freezes and 
crashes can start happening for seemingly no reason.
To check for problems with the system memory, boot from the Ubuntu 
CD included with this book (see Chapter 2 to remind yourself how to do this). 
As soon as the purple boot screen appears, press a key and select your language 
from the gray menu that pops up. Then, choose Test memory from the main 
menu, and press ENTER. The screen will turn blue, and the Memtest86 program 
will start running (Figure 21-4).
Memtest86 repeatedly writes things to your system memory and then 
accesses them a few moments later. It’s sort of like a stress test for your RAM. 
Let it run until the Pass percentage at the top right of the screen has gone 
past 100 percent once or twice—this might take as long as an hour or two, 
depending on how much system memory you have. By that time, Memtest86 
should have found any faults in the system memory and reported them on 
the screen. If it does find a problem, you might need to get some of your RAM 
replaced, because it could be damaged.
You can turn off your computer at any time while Memtest86 is running—
you don’t need to shut it down properly as you usually would.

382
Chapter 21
Figure 21-4: Checking for memory faults with Memtest86
Use an Older Kernel
Some freezes occur because of problems with kernel updates or drivers. You 
can try using an older version of the Linux kernel if you have one installed. 
Take a look at “If an Update Ruins Your Day . . . or System” on page 84 for 
instructions on running an older kernel.
Use Rescue Mode
If you’ve asked for help online, chances are you’ll be called upon to type some 
commands to try to fix your computer. There’s no way of entering any com-
mands if you can’t get it to start up, though, so you’ll need to use the rescue 
mode to get yourself to a command line.
Restart your computer, and, as quickly as you can, hold down the SHIFT 
key until a GRUB boot menu like the one in Figure 21-5 appears. If you have 
a dual-boot setup, you’ll be used to seeing this boot menu anyway. Then, use 
the keyboard to select the topmost item with (recovery mode) in its name, and 
press ENTER. Text will flash across the screen for a while, and you’ll be left at 
the Recovery Menu screen.
Use the arrow keys to highlight the netroot option, and press ENTER. 
After some more text passes by, you’ll be dropped to a root command line, 
which says something like root@rg-laptop:~# and has a blinking cursor. From 
here, you can type commands that could help you fix the computer.
In particular, you might like to try updating your system to see whether a 
subsequent update fixes your problem. (This will work only if you’re connected 
to the Internet.) Type apt-get update; then press ENTER, and wait for the list of 
packages to be updated. Then, type apt-get dist-upgrade to see whether any 
more updates are available for you to install.
NOTE
Wireless Internet connections are unlikely to work in recovery mode. Plug your computer in 
with an Ethernet cable if you can.

Reinstall Ubuntu
It pains me to say it, but if you just can’t fix the problem no matter what you 
try, it might be worth reinstalling Ubuntu. To do this, follow the instructions 
in Chapter 2. You might need some of the advice on manual partitioning 
from Appendix C too.
Before you reinstall, remember to back up any files that you want to keep. 
You can do this by copying them to an external hard disk or USB memory 
stick while you’re running the live CD—all you need to do to access the files 
is mount your hard disk as described in “Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your 
Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)” on page 324 (but mount your Ubuntu 
partition rather than your Windows one).
Windows Won’t Boot
If you installed Ubuntu in a dual-boot setup, you may find that the computer 
restarts or displays an error message when you try to boot Windows instead of 
Ubuntu. Dual-boot Windows setups sometimes have a problem with hiberna-
tion and disk checking, so try the following steps to see whether you can get 
it working again:
1.
Boot into Ubuntu, and mount your Windows partition (see Chapter 18 
for details on how to do this).
2.
Find hiberfil.sys (it should be in the top-level folder of your Windows 
partition, as shown in Figure 21-6), and rename it something like 
old_hiberfil.sys. This will cause Windows to ignore all of the hibernation 
information it has stored.
3.
Restart your computer, and boot into Windows by selecting it from the 
GRUB boot menu. Ideally, Windows will now boot.

384
Chapter 21
4.
If Windows does not boot and you get a blank screen or it restarts, reboot 
the computer into Windows again, but this time press the F8 key a few 
times immediately after choosing to boot Windows from the GRUB menu. 
A Windows boot menu should appear.
5.
Select the Safe Mode (with Networking) option, and see whether that runs. 
If it does, perform a disk check in Windows. You can do this by going to 
(My) Computer, right-clicking your hard disk, and selecting Properties. 
You can find the Error-checking option you need on the Tools tab. Once 
the check is finished, restart the computer to see whether Windows will 
start normally.
You may need to repeat the rebooting-and-pressing-F8 procedure once 
or twice for it to stick—let it run a disk check whenever it ask to do so.

Sound and Video Problems
If you’re met with silence when you try to watch a movie or play a song, either 
you’ve rented a Charlie Chaplin film or you’re having issues with your sound 
card. Assuming it’s the latter, you’ll find that most sound-related problems in 
Ubuntu are caused by using incorrect sound card settings. Unfortunately, 
the number of these settings tends to be overwhelming, and it’s rarely obvi-
ous which ones you should change to get things working. Trial and error is 
the order of the day when it comes to sound problems, I’m afraid, although 
I’ve tried to explain as many of the relevant options as possible in this section 
to help you out.
If the problem has more to do with what you’re not seeing than what 
you’re not hearing, then you’re possibly in for an easier ride. Video problems 
tend to be easier to fix—most of the time, all you’ll need to do is find the 
right piece of software to install and then, erm, install it. Skip to the end of 
the section for more on video issues.

Ubuntu Doesn’t Play Any Sounds
There are many reasons why Ubuntu might not be playing any sounds. I’ll 
concentrate on some of the more basic issues in this section, but if none of 
this helps, you can always try the Ubuntu forums or IRC; both are discussed 
in detail in Chapter 20.
To start troubleshooting, find a song on your computer and play it in 
Rhythmbox or the Totem Movie Player. (If you need it, there’s a sample song 
available in the /usr/share/example-content/Ubuntu_Free_Culture_Showcase folder, 
aptly called “Frustration Blues.”) You need to have a sound file playing con-
stantly in the background so that you can tell whether changing any of these 
settings has worked.
If you are unable to even start playing the file, Ubuntu may not have 
detected your sound card properly. Open a Terminal (Applications
AccessoriesTerminal), type aplay -l into it, and press ENTER. If the list of 
playback hardware devices is empty, your sound card hasn’t been detected. 
In this case, you’ll definitely need to get some community support—see 
Chapter 20 for more information on using the Ubuntu forums and IRC.
Next, check that your speakers are turned on, turned up, and plugged 
into the correct socket on your computer (it’s often a light green color). Many 
times in the past I’ve plugged my speakers into the microphone socket and 
sat there wondering why they were silent. When you’re confident that your 
speakers are OK, try the following steps:
1.
Click the speaker icon on the top panel, and select Sound Preferences 
from the menu that pops up. The Sound Preferences window will appear 
(Figure 21-7).
2.
Make sure that the Mute option is not checked and that the Output volume 
slider at the top of the window is pulled all the way to the right.
3.
Click the Applications tab, and make sure that none of the applications 
in the list is muted or set to a low volume.
4.
Click the Output tab, and make sure that the right connector is chosen. 
If you’re not sure, try choosing different connectors by trial and error 
until you get one that works. If none of them works, return this option to 
its original setting (usually Analog Speakers).
5.
Click the Hardware tab, and choose a different device from the Profile 
option. Then, repeat the previous steps, checking that nothing is muted 
or at low volume and that the right output device is selected. Trial and 
error often works.
If none of this helped, check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread
.php?t=205449/. It’s a pretty comprehensive guide to identifying sound prob-
lems, though it requires quite a lot of work in the Terminal. (See Chapter 9 if 
you need to refresh your memory on how the Terminal works.)

Figure 21-7: The Sound Preferences window
My Microphone Doesn’t Work
As long as your sound card is detected correctly by Ubuntu, any microphone 
with a standard audio jack connection (similar to the connector on head-
phones) should work.
To test your microphone, select SystemPreferencesSound to open 
the Sound Preferences window, and then go to the Input tab (Figure 21-8). 
There you’ll see an Input level indicator, which should dance up and down 
when you make a sound. If nothing happens to the indicator when you make 
a noise, your microphone isn’t being picked up, so try some of the following tips.
Plug it in
Check that the microphone is plugged into the correct socket 
(it should be marked by a small microphone symbol and is often pink). 
Also, be aware that some sound cards can switch inputs and outputs between 
different sockets, so what you think is the microphone socket might have 
actually been assigned to something else. In that case, try plugging the 
microphone into the other sockets.
Turn it up
Go back to the Input tab in the Sound Preferences window, 
and turn up the Input volume as high as it will go if necessary. If your 
sound card or microphone has a volume control, make sure that that is 
turned up too.
Check that it’s not muted
Also on the Input tab, make sure that the 
Mute option next to the Input volume control is not checked.

Wounded Wings
387
Figure 21-8: The Input tab of the Sound Preferences window
Choose the right device
Ubuntu sometimes detects sound cards as 
being more than one device. Click the Hardware tab in the Sound Pref-
erences window, and try choosing a different sound device from the list 
or a different profile for the device if you can. You could also try changing 
the device in the Choose a device for sound input list on the Input tab.
Choose the right input
Some sound cards have more than one micro-
phone input. This is often the case on laptops, which might have a 
microphone socket and a built-in microphone. Check whether you’ve 
enabled the correct input by changing the Connector option on the 
Input tab of the Sound Preferences window (Figure 21-8).
Test using a different program
The lack of sound from your micro-
phone could be a problem with the program you’re using to record the 
sound rather than the way the microphone is set up. Try using a different 
program to test the microphone. The Sound Recorder (Applications
Sound & VideoSound Recorder) is usually helpful.
NOTE
One program that seems to suffer particularly heavily from microphone-related problems 
is Skype. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype/ for some Skype-specific 
sound troubleshooting tips.
I Can’t Play an Audio or Video File
The most common reason for not being able to play an audio or video file is 
that you don’t have the necessary codec installed to play the file. A codec is a 
small piece of software that adds support for a given audio/video format into 

388
Chapter 21
a program. Rhythmbox and the Totem Movie Player normally find the right 
codec for you (for example, see “Project 14A: Installing MP3 Support for 
Audio Apps” on page 262). However, if they fail, try installing the Ubuntu 
restricted extras package—this package contains a lot of extra codecs. Once 
it’s installed, close and re-open your audio/video file and see whether it 
plays. If not, you can try using a different program, which might have the 
right codec built-in. Try installing the MPlayer Media Player or VLC media 
player—both of these programs have support for a wide range of formats.
If you’re struggling to play a video on the Web (for example, one on 
YouTube), see “Multimedia Plug-Ins” on page 62.
Another reason for a file being unplayable is that it is damaged. If you 
downloaded the file, try downloading it again—occasionally, parts of the file 
are accidentally missed during the download process, so repeating the down-
load should fix this.
Finally, you might have a problem with your sound card. See “Ubuntu 
Doesn’t Play Any Sounds” on page 385 for advice.
Internet and Network Connection Problems
If you haven’t been able to get Ubuntu connected to the Internet (or a net-
work), the most likely cause is that your wireless/network card hasn’t been 
detected correctly. Other people have probably had the same problem with 
the same network card before, so it’s always a good idea to search online to 
see whether you can find specific instructions on setting up your card. You’re 
not guaranteed to find something useful (or intelligible), however, so I’ve 
provided some general instructions on diagnosing connection problems and 
installing network and wireless card drivers in this section.
Finding the Cause of a Connection Problem
There are so many different causes of connection problems that it can be dif-
ficult to know where to start. In this section, I’ve provided a few tips on how 
you can get more information to help you figure out your connection prob-
lem. Unfortunately, some of the information is quite technical, so you might 
find some of the results of these tests confusing. If that is the case, just make 
a note of the results you get. The information might be useful to someone in 
the forums or elsewhere, who could help you fix the problem.
Do you have a connection to the Internet?
Open Firefox, and try to visit 
a popular website, like http://www.google.com/ or http://www.bbc.co.uk/. If 
neither of those pages loads and you get a “Server not found” message 
or similar, you may not have a link to the Internet, or you might just 
have a problem with Firefox. To check, open a Terminal (Applications
AccessoriesTerminal), and then type ping 209.85.227.106 into it, followed 
by ENTER. This should ping Google’s servers; pinging a server is a way of 
checking whether your computer can communicate with it. If you receive 
a message starting with the text 64 bytes from (as shown in Figure 21-9), 
you have a working Internet connection. Press CTRL-C to stop pinging 

Wounded Wings
389
Google. In this case, the problem might be with your DNS settings or 
some other software, rather than your connection or your network/
wireless card. If you get any other message, you probably aren’t con-
nected to the Internet, so it could be a hardware problem.
Figure 21-9: The results of pinging one of Google’s servers if you have a working 
Internet connection
Is your card recognized?
Open a Terminal, and type lshw -c network 
-short, and press ENTER. A list of the network and wireless cards that were 
recognized on your computer will be displayed, similar to the one shown 
in Figure 21-10; check whether any of them have a description matching 
the make or model of your card. If they do, the card has been recognized 
but may not necessarily have the right drivers.
Figure 21-10: The list of recognized network and wireless cards on my computer
Is your card turned on?
If you have a wireless card, it may have been 
turned off. See the instructions in “No Wireless Networks Are Found” on 
page 392 for advice on how to check whether this is the case.
Are you using the right drivers?
Ubuntu sometimes uses the wrong 
driver for a network/wireless card. To check which driver is being used 
for your card, open a Terminal, and type lshw -c network followed by ENTER. 
Scroll down through all of the text, and find the card that has a product 
or vendor matching those of your card. Then, scroll down a few more 
lines until you get to the configuration line. This will tell you which driver 
is being used and the version number of the driver. You can compare 

390
Chapter 21
this with the information for your card at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
HardwareSupportComponentsWiredNetworkCards/ (for wired network cards) 
or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/ 
(for wireless cards).
Have you checked your settings?
Select SystemPreferences
Network Connections, and find the entry for your connection on the 
appropriate tab. Then, select the connection, and click Edit. Check 
through the settings in the Editing window to see whether any of them 
are wrong—the usual suspects are your default gateway and DNS servers 
(if you have a manually configured wired network) and the wireless 
security key (if you have a wireless connection).
For those of you struggling with a wireless connection, you can find a 
wireless troubleshooting guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/
WirelessTroubleShootingGuide/. It’s quite technical in places, though, so you might 
prefer to ask for help on the Ubuntu forums.
Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card
If your network card or wireless card hasn’t been recognized or isn’t work-
ing as expected, you might need to install some different drivers for it. You 
can try a few methods, and the one that works will very much depend on 
the make and model of your card. I’ve included two of the most general 
ones in the following sections, but some cards need you to follow very spe-
cific instructions to get them working. The lists at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
HardwareSupportComponentsWiredNetworkCards/ (wired cards) and https://
help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/ (wireless cards) 
should be able to help you figure out which method to use.
Check for Restricted Drivers
Some network/wireless cards have restricted drivers that you can download to 
get your card working. These drivers are normally provided by the manufac-
turer of the card and are “restricted” in the sense that they can’t be fixed by 
Ubuntu developers if something goes wrong with them (in other words, 
they’re not open source).
You need to be connected to the Internet to download restricted drivers. 
If you don’t have a working connection (probably because you’re currently 
in the process of trying to get your card working!), try using an Ethernet 
cable to plug the computer directly into your wireless router or cable modem 
(see Chapter 4 for more information). This will work only if you have a func-
tioning wired network card. If your wired network card doesn’t work, you 
won’t be able to follow these instructions.

1.
Select SystemAdministrationHardware Drivers. Ubuntu will search 
for restricted drivers. If it finds any, they will be displayed in the list at the 
top of the window (as in Figure 21-3).
2.
Check to see whether any of the restricted drivers have anything to do 
with networks or wireless (it should say in their descriptions). If you find 
one that does, select it, and click Activate to download and install it. Some 
cards require two drivers, so if you find two drivers that look relevant, 
install them both.
3.
Once the installation has finished, you’ll probably be told to restart the 
computer. It’s a good idea to do this anyway, so restart.
4.
Ideally, after restarting and logging in again, you’ll now be able to use 
your network/wireless connection. See Chapter 4 for details on how to 
get connected.
Install Windows Drivers
Believe it or not, you can sometimes get the Windows drivers for your network/
wireless card working in Ubuntu. To do this, you’ll need the Windows driver 
for your card, plus a program called ndiswrapper that converts the driver into 
something more Ubuntu-friendly. Full instructions are available at https://
help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper/, but here’s an outline 
to help you get started:
1.
Find the Windows drivers for your card. These normally come supplied 
on a CD with your computer, or you may be able to download them from 
the card manufacturer’s website. A list of drivers is available at http://
sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ndiswrapper/.
2.
Find the .inf file for the Windows XP version of your card’s drivers. The 
drivers are normally provided as Zip files, which you can open and search 
inside for the INF file, or in folders on the driver CD. If you can’t find 
the file, you might be able to get more information on the ndiswrapper 
website mentioned in the previous step.
3.
Save the .inf file on your desktop or in some other convenient location.
4.
Borrow a computer with Internet access, and download the .deb files 
from the following links (you’ll need to click the link for a nearby loca-
tion before the file can be downloaded):
http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/all/ndiswrapper-common/download
http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/ndiswrapper-utils-1.9/download
http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/ndisgtk/download
5.
Save the three .deb files to a memory stick or some other storage device, 
and use it to copy them onto your Ubuntu computer. Again, copying 
them onto the desktop would be convenient.

392
Chapter 21
6.
Now, double-click the ndiswrapper-common file, and install it (see 
“Project 6B: Installing Software from a PPA: OpenSonic” on page 88 
to learn how to do this).
7.
Once that’s installed, install the ndiswrapper-utils file. The order that you 
install these files in is important.
8.
Finally, install the ndisgtk file.
9.
Now, select SystemAdministrationWindows Wireless Drivers, and 
enter your password if prompted. The Wireless Network Drivers window 
will open (Figure 21-11).
10. Click Install New Driver, and then click the Location button. Select the 
.inf file you found earlier, and click Open.
11. Click Install. If everything goes to plan, the Windows driver for your card 
will be installed.
12. Restart your computer, and try to get connected once you’ve logged in 
again (Chapter 4).
Don’t worry if something goes wrong—there are several minor problems 
that might trip you up during this process. Visit the ndiswrapper website 
mentioned in Step 1, or ask on the Ubuntu forums for more specific advice.
Figure 21-11: The Wireless Network Drivers window
No Wireless Networks Are Found
If you know that your wireless card is working in Ubuntu but you can’t seem 
to find any networks, try the steps in this section:
1.
Check to make sure that your wireless card is turned on. Many laptops 
have a keyboard shortcut that toggles the wireless card on and off (on 
mine it’s FN-F2). Some cards have a physical switch that you need to flip 
instead. If your card has an antenna with a cable, make sure that it’s 
firmly secured to the card too.

Wounded Wings
393
2.
Now, right-click the Network Manager icon on the top panel, and make sure 
that Enable Networking and Enable Wireless are checked (Figure 21-12). 
If they aren’t, check them, and wait a minute or two while the wireless 
card wakes up.
3.
If the Enable Wireless option was already checked, try unchecking it, wait-
ing for a minute or so, and then checking it again. Your wireless card might 
have needed turning off and on again to wake it up. You can also try doing 
this with the hardware switch/keyboard toggle I mentioned in Step 1.
4.
If none of this has any effect, try restarting your computer. Some wireless 
cards work fine until you hibernate or suspend the computer, after 
which they fall into a deep sleep. Restarting should be enough to wake it 
up.
5.
You should also check that the network you want to connect to doesn’t 
have a hidden network name (also called an SSID). If it does, it won’t 
appear in Network Manager’s list, and you’ll have to manually enter its 
name to be able to connect. To do this, click the Network Manager icon, 
choose Connect to Hidden Wireless Network from the menu, and fill out 
the details in the window that appears.
6.
Finally, if you’re still struggling, are you sure that you are sufficiently 
close to a wireless base station? If the signal is too weak, your card might 
not pick up the network at all.
Figure 21-12: Making sure that wireless and 
network connections are enabled in Network 
Manager
Other Users on My Computer Can’t Connect
If you have more than one user account on your computer, you might find 
that you can connect to the Internet, but other users can’t. To fix this prob-
lem, you need to make your network connection available to all users:
1.
While working in your user account, select SystemPreferences
Network Connections.
2.
Find the network connection that you use on one of the tabs. For example, 
if you use a wireless network called “Marconi,” you would click the Wireless 
tab and look for Marconi in the list there.
3.
Select the network, and click Edit.

394
Chapter 21
4.
Check the Available to all users option at the bottom of the screen, and 
click Apply.
5.
Type your password when prompted. The network will disconnect, and 
you may need to reconnect it by using the Network Manager icon on the 
top panel (see Chapter 4 for further details on connecting).
6.
Log in to a different user account. You should now be able to connect to 
the network in that user account too.
Problems with the Display and Graphics Cards
Recently, Ubuntu has been doing an excellent job of detecting graphics cards, 
so it’s unlikely that you’ll ever be left staring at a blank screen. Things aren’t 
guaranteed to turn out perfect, however. This section covers such problems 
as getting 3D acceleration support (if it’s missing) and adjusting your screen 
resolution (if it’s looking weird). Just in case, there’s something to help you 
with a dreaded blank screen too.
Games/Compiz Don’t Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers
If you can’t get Compiz or a certain game to work, you might need to install 
some accelerated graphics drivers. This is because only basic drivers (which 
can’t handle fancy effects and 3D games) are installed for some graphics cards 
by default, due to the lack of availability of suitable open source alternatives. If 
accelerated drivers exist for your card, you can install the more powerful (but 
possibly less open source) drivers by selecting SystemAdministration
Hardware Drivers, selecting the graphics driver from the list, and then click-
ing Activate to install it. Once it’s installed, restart the computer, and the 
new driver should be enabled.
You can directly download Linux graphics drivers from some manufac-
turers. These tend to be updated more regularly than the ones that come 
with Ubuntu, and they may have some extra features too. The next couple 
of sections cover how to get these drivers for the two biggest manufacturers, 
ATI and nVidia.
ATI Cards
1.
Go to http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx/, and select 
Linux x86 from the list on the left side of the page.
2.
Choose the type of card you have from the next list, and choose the 
model/series of your card from the list next to that.
3.
Click GO!, and you’ll be taken to a download page for the driver. Scroll 
down to the bottom of the page, and click Download.
4.
When prompted, click Save File to download the driver.
5.
When the download finishes, find the driver file. It will probably be saved 
in your Downloads folder, and its name should end with .run.

Wounded Wings
395
6.
Open a Terminal (ApplicationsAccessoriesTerminal), and type cd 
Downloads (followed by ENTER) to change to your Downloads folder (if it’s 
stored in there).
7.
Now, type chmod +x ati-driver*.run, and press ENTER to make it so that 
you can run the file as a program.
8.
To start the installer, type sudo ./ati-driver, and then press the TAB key. 
This should complete the name of the installer file for you, so you can 
press ENTER and run the installer.
9.
Enter your password. Then, follow the instructions on the screen to install 
the driver.
nVidia Cards
1.
Go to http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html, and click the link for the latest 
version under the “Linux IA32” heading (or the “Linux IA64” heading if 
you’re running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu).
2.
Click Download and then Agree & Download. When prompted, click 
Save File to download the driver.
3.
Find the driver file; it will probably be in your Downloads folder, with a 
name ending with .run.
4.
Open a Terminal (ApplicationsAccessoriesTerminal), type cd Down-
loads, and then press ENTER to change to your Downloads folder (if it’s 
stored in there).
5.
Now, type chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux*.run, and press ENTER to make it so that 
you can run the file as a program.
6.
To start the installer, type sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux, and then press the TAB 
key. This should complete the name of the installer file for you, so you 
can press ENTER and run the installer.
7.
Enter your password, and then follow the instructions on the screen to 
install the driver.
NOTE
Because they’re not open source, the quality of some of the graphics drivers can vary, 
and problems can’t be fixed by the Ubuntu developers (as they can be with open source 
ones). As such, some accelerated graphics drivers can cause problems, most often when 
you try to hibernate or suspend your computer. If you do run into problems, consider 
uninstalling the driver so that you revert to the default open source one.
The Screen Looks Stretched or the Wrong Size
If your screen doesn’t look quite right, the screen resolution has probably 
been detected incorrectly. To fix this problem, select SystemPreferences
Monitors, and change the Resolution setting to match the default resolution of 
your screen (trial and error will suffice if you don’t know what the default is). 

396
Chapter 21
Click Apply; if everything looks OK, click Keep This Configuration. If your 
screen goes blank, don’t worry—just wait for 30 seconds, and the resolution 
will be returned to its original setting.
If the correct resolution for your monitor isn’t available from the list, you 
might have to use a different display driver. See “Games/Compiz Don’t Work: 
Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers” on page 394.
The Screen Is Blank
One possible cause of a blank screen is that something went wrong with your 
graphics card or its drivers. Thankfully, this is a reasonably rare occurrence, 
and it’s much more likely that something minor (and easy to fix) happened. 
Peruse the following tips before you start worrying about some sort of graphics 
card apocalypse scenario:
Check that the display cable is connected
Most desktop computers 
have a separate monitor that plugs into the back of the computer. Look 
at the back of the monitor, and make sure both of the cables coming out 
of the back of it are firmly plugged in at both ends. You might also want to 
check that the display is switched on and that its power cable hasn’t fused.
Try to wake up the computer
Your computer may have gone into a 
power-saving (sleep) mode, which you can wake it up from by moving 
your mouse or pressing keys on the keyboard. If that doesn’t work, try 
pressing the power button on your computer once. This sometimes 
wakes computers up from their sleep too.
Switch to a command line
The part of the Ubuntu that’s responsible 
for displaying things on the screen is called X11, or just X. Sometimes X 
fails to start. To see whether this is the case, press CTRL-ALT-F2. You should 
see a login: prompt if everything but X is working properly. You can type 
your username and password (pressing ENTER after typing each one) to 
access a command line, just like the Terminal you met in Chapter 9. While 
you’re using the command line, try typing sudo startx, followed by 
ENTER, and type your password again if prompted. This will try to start X; it 
might work, or it might give you an error message telling you what the 
problem is. Alternatively, type sudo reboot to restart your computer. (If 
you’re wondering what happened here, pressing CTRL-ALT-F2 switched 
you to a different virtual terminal. Ubuntu starts a few virtual terminals 
and uses them for different things; pressing CTRL-ALT-F7 will switch you 
back to the virtual terminal used by X to display everything.)
Restart the computer
Some computers occasionally start up without 
turning on the graphics card or the monitor. (This tends to be more of a 
problem on older computers.) As a last resort, try turning the computer 
off and then on again by pressing the power button. If the computer won’t 
turn off, hold down the power button for a few seconds until it does.

Hard Disks and Storage Problems
I never really understood how you could completely fill up your hard disk 
until I bought a digital video camera. If you have a similarly expensive disk 
usage habit, this section is for you. There are a few tips on how to free up some 
disk space and, worst-case scenario, how to deal with a completely full disk.
My Disk Is Almost Full
If your hard disk is almost full, Ubuntu will pop up a warning message similar 
to the one in Figure 21-13. Click the Examine button to start the Disk Usage 
Analyzer—it will scan your disk and display a colored chart showing you what 
is using most of the disk space. You can use this information to hunt down 
the files and folders that are taking up most of your disk’s capacity. If you’re 
wondering exactly how much disk space you have left, select System
AdministrationSystem Monitor, and look on the File Systems tab to see 
how much space is left on each disk.
Figure 21-13: A message warning you that your disk is almost full
Apart from rooting through your home folder and deleting unwanted 
files, you can try a few other things to free up some disk space:
Empty your Trash
When you delete files, they get moved to the Trash 
folder in case you change your mind about having removed them. To 
empty the Trash folder (thus permanently removing all the files in it), 
click the Trash icon on the bottom panel, and click the Empty Trash 
button in the Nautilus window that appears.
Clean up unwanted packages
When you remove a package using the 
Ubuntu Software Center, it sometimes leaves other packages that were 
installed at the same time on the system, even though they’re not needed 
anymore. To remove them, open a Terminal, type sudo apt-get autore-
move, and then press ENTER. Type your password when prompted, followed 
by ENTER, and see whether there are any leftover packages that can be 
removed. If there are, press Y and then press ENTER to remove them.

398
Chapter 21
Empty the package cache
When the Ubuntu Software Center installs a 
program, it keeps the package used to install it for a little while in case it’s 
needed again. These cached files can take up quite a bit of disk space, 
but it’s fine to delete them (the program won’t be uninstalled or any-
thing like that). Open a Terminal, and type sudo apt-get clean, followed 
by ENTER. Type your password if prompted, and then press ENTER to empty 
the cache.
My Disk Is Completely Full
If your hard disk is completely full, you may not be able to start Ubuntu at all, 
and all you’ll get is a blank screen. If this happens, press CTRL-ALT-F2 to change 
to a Terminal login prompt. Type your username, followed by ENTER, followed 
by your password, followed by ENTER again, to access a command line. Once 
there, try clearing some disk space by typing some of the commands recom-
mended in “My Disk Is Almost Full” on page 397. You can also use the rm 
command to remove some files in your home folder, but be careful: There’s 
no undo when using rm.
Once you’ve cleared a little disk space, type sudo reboot to restart the 
computer. With any luck, there will be enough disk space for you to be able 
to log in now.
I Can’t Delete a File
The usual reason for not being able to delete a file is because you don’t have 
the right permissions to delete it (see Chapter 7 for an explanation of file 
permissions). Right-click a blank area of the folder that the file is stored in, 
choose Properties, and select the Permissions tab. If you are listed as the 
owner, make sure that your Folder Access permissions are set to Create and 
delete files. Click Close, and then try to delete the file again.
If you are not the owner of the folder, you’ll have to gain ownership of it 
before you can delete the file. This is where you need to ask yourself, “Should 
I really be deleting someone else’s file?” Sometimes file permissions get messed 
up and so the file might be yours—in that case, it’s OK to delete it. If it’s 
someone else’s file, though, ask for their permission first. If you’re convinced 
that deleting the file is a good idea, open a Terminal, and use the chown com-
mand to change the owner of the folder. Here’s how it works: If I wanted to 
delete a file called cats.jpg from the Pets folder in my Pictures folder, I would 
type sudo chown phil ~/Pictures/Pets, followed by the ENTER key (remember, ~ 
means “my home folder”). After typing my password and pressing ENTER 
again, I would become the owner of the Pets folder and could delete cats.jpg as 
normal. Of course, you should substitute the name of the folder and your 
username in place of mine for this to work for you.
NOTE
Don’t use this method to delete system files (in other words, files that aren’t stored in the 
/home folder) unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing. You don’t have permis-
sion to delete system files for a reason; you could really screw up your system if you remove 
something vital.

Software Installation Problems
Ubuntu’s software management tools tend to operate pretty smoothly these 
days. Nevertheless, I’ve included some troubleshooting tips for two or three 
problems that used to be common (but seem to be getting rarer with each 
release). If you’re having a problem with installing, removing, or updating 
packages, this section is for you.
I Get an Error About Unauthenticated Packages
If you get an error message about unauthenticated packages when you try to 
install a program, try the following:
1.
Select SystemAdministrationUpdate Manager to open the Update 
Manager.
2.
Click the Check button, and enter your password if prompted. The pack-
age list will be updated, along with all the files that are used to check 
whether your packages are “authentic.”
3.
When it has finished updating the package list, close the Update Manager, 
and try to install your program again.
If you’re still getting the error message, you may have added a software 
repository without adding its GPG key. The GPG key is required to do the 
authentication stuff that the error message is talking about. If this is the case, 
look at “Adding Extra Software Repositories” on page 86 for instructions on 
how to add the GPG key for a repository.
I Get a dpkg Error
There are a couple of common reasons why you might get an error message 
related to dpkg when you try to install, update, or remove a software package.
If you get an error saying E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error 
code (1), you could have a broken package on your system. Here are some 
techniques you can try to fix a broken package:
1.
Select ApplicationAccessoriesTerminal to open a Terminal.
2.
Type sudo apt-get install --fix-broken, and press ENTER. Type your pass-
word when prompted, and press ENTER again. This command looks for 
broken packages and tries to fix them.
3.
With any luck, this will fix the problem; try installing a package via the 
Ubuntu Software Center to see whether you still get the dpkg error message.
4.
If you do still get the error message, type sudo dpkg --configure -a into the 
Terminal, and press ENTER. This command tries to fix half-installed pack-
ages if there are any.
5.
Try installing a package from the Ubuntu Software Center again. If you’re 
still getting an error message, ask for help on the Ubuntu forums.

400
Chapter 21
If you get an error message saying E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/
lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) or E: Unable to lock the 
administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), you are probably running more 
than one package manager (APT frontend) at the same time (see the note at 
the end of Chapter 6). For example, if you are installing a package using the 
apt-get command in a Terminal while simultaneously trying to install a pro-
gram with the Ubuntu Software Center, you will get this error message.
Wait until one of the package managers finishes what it’s doing, and then 
close it and try to use the other one again. If no other package managers are 
running, you won’t get this error message. If you don’t think you have any 
other package managers running, the Update Manager could be running 
in the background and causing the problem. Wait for a few minutes for the 
Update Manager to finish what it’s doing and then try again.
I Have a Broken Update
If you update your computer using Update Manager but receive an error 
message saying that you have a broken update, try the instructions in “I Get 
a dpkg Error” on page 399 to try to fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, try 
asking on the Ubuntu forums for help—there may be a bug in the package 
that was being updated when the error occurred.
Common Problems with Applications
So many applications are available for Ubuntu that it would be impossible to 
go through each one and point out what might possibly, some day, go wrong. 
Instead, in this section I’ve chosen to provide some general advice on how to 
deal with misbehaving programs, plus a sneaky little section on a particularly 
common Firefox problem. If it is something specific that you need to handle, 
it’s never a bad idea to try looking at the help files for a given program. Select-
ing HelpContents should get you to a manual for most software. Failing 
that, a Google search often does the trick for me.
Firefox Says It’s Already Running
When you exit Firefox, it sometimes takes a while to close itself down properly—
the window will disappear, but Firefox could still be running somewhere in 
the murky depths of your computer. When you try to open Firefox again, you 
may receive a message that Firefox is running in the background, so you can’t 
open a new window. This is no good, because you want a Firefox window that 
you can see! If this happens, open a Terminal (ApplicationsAccessories
Terminal), type killall firefox, and then press ENTER. (The command is case 
sensitive, so be sure you’re typing in all lowercase.) This will force Firefox to 
shut down immediately. With that done, try to open Firefox again, and the 
window should pop up as normal. If it still isn’t working, try repeating the 
previous command one or two more times.

401
A Program Always Crashes
If you have a program that keeps crashing, try running it in a Terminal to see 
what’s going wrong. You’ll have to get the name of the command needed to 
run the program first—see “Reporting a Bug” on page 359 for information 
on how you can find it. Once you have the command, type it into the Ter-
minal, and press ENTER. The program should run as normal, so keep using it 
until it crashes. When it does, look at the Terminal to see whether it left any 
clues as to what’s going wrong in there. Error messages in the Terminal can 
be quite cryptic, so you might like to ask someone on the forums or IRC 
(both of which are discussed in Chapter 20) if they know what it means.
If the messages in the Terminal are no help, you should report a bug. 
See “Bugs, Bugs, Glorious Bugs” on page 358 for details.
A Program Won’t Start
If a program doesn’t start when you click its shortcut in the Applications 
menu, try running it in the Terminal, as described in the previous section. It 
could be crashing soon after starting and might leave some information 
about the crash in the Terminal.
My Computer Is Running Slowly
Certain tasks take up lots of computing power and cause your computer to 
run slowly. Burning a CD, installing software, and converting music files to a 
different format all tend to strain your system, so you shouldn’t be surprised 
if things feel a little sluggish when something like that is running. But what if 
your computer is running slowly even if you’re not running anything inten-
sive? You can investigate the cause of the slowdown by selecting System
AdministrationSystem Monitor to open the System Monitor. Select the 
Resources tab, and check your CPU (processor) usage—if it’s around 100 per-
cent, then a program running in the background is probably responsible for 
the problem (for example, the one in Figure 21-14). Choose the Processes 
tab, and click the % CPU column heading a couple of times until it has an 
“up” arrow next to it. This will sort the list of programs in order of how much 
of the processor they are using. The one that’s using all of the CPU should 
appear at the top of the list.
It’s normally best to wait a few minutes and see whether the program 
reduces its CPU usage by itself. After all, it could be some system software 
running a scan or some other maintenance operation. If it doesn’t go away, 
the program might have gotten stuck, so select it and click End Process to force 
it to close. Your system should return to its usual speed within a few seconds.
If you didn’t notice high CPU usage on the Resources tab, then it’s possi-
ble that something is overusing your hard disk instead. Programs that do this 
almost always finish what they’re doing within five or ten minutes, so you 
should probably ride it out. If it persists, the easiest way of fixing the problem 
is by restarting the computer.

Lost Files
Losing an important file is one of those uniquely frustrating experiences in 
life. If you’ve looked in all of the most likely locations (like your home folder), 
try one of the following:
Recent Documents
Select PlacesRecent Documents to see whether 
the missing file is in the list of recently edited files. If it was an office doc-
ument, try the FileRecent Documents menu in OpenOffice.org too.
Basic search
The basic Search for Files tool is useful only if you can 
remember part of the file’s name. Select PlacesSearch, type part of the 
file’s name in the Name contains box, and click Search. It might turn up 
in the list of search results.
Heavy-duty search
The more advanced Tracker search tool can look 
inside documents, which is handy if you don’t remember the file’s name 
but you do remember some of its contents. Install the Tracker Search Tool 
from the Ubuntu Software Center, and select SystemPreferences
Search and Indexing. Check the Enable indexing option on the Gen-
eral tab, and click Apply. Click Restart in the warning window that 
appears, and wait for Tracker to build its search index (about 15 to 
20 minutes should do it). When it has finished, select Applications
AccessoriesTracker Search Tool, and search for your lost file there.

Wounded Wings
403
Look in the Trash
It’s possible that you accidentally deleted the file. 
Click the Trash icon on the bottom panel, and look for it in there.
Another explanation for the lost file might be that it was saved in a tem-
porary folder. This happens when you open an email attachment, for example—
the file is put in the temporary folder by your email client and then opened 
using the default application for that type of file. Unfortunately, some programs 
don’t realize that it’s a temporary file, and they let you save it in the temporary 
directory . . . which is periodically wiped clean. If you suspect that this may 
have happened and you have restarted your computer since you last saved 
the file, then it’s probably gone forever.
If you haven’t restarted, there may still be hope; try opening the (unmodi-
fied, original) file again to see which folder it gets stored in by selecting File
Save As (or similar) in the program you’re using. Then, check which folder 
the Save window opens up to. For example, the Evolution mail client tempo-
rarily stores attachments that you open in a randomly named folder within 
the /home/username/.evolution/cache/tmp folder (see Figure 21-15 for an 
example). Note the name of the folder, and open your home folder. Then, 
select GoLocation, type the name of the folder in the box that appears, 
and try to find your file in the folder that opens. It’s hardly convenient, but 
it might just help you find your file.

Where Can I Go to Get More Help?
Many of the instructions in this chapter are quite general, so they might miss 
out on the specifics that you need to get your computer behaving properly. If 
you suspect that this is the case or if nothing in this chapter seemed to help 
with your problem, then it’s a good idea to seek help elsewhere. Ubuntu has 
a large and thriving online support community that prides itself on being 
friendly and helpful. There are quite a few options for you to choose from:
z
Visit https://help.ubuntu.com/, and use the search to find help guides and 
tutorials.
z
Ask a question on the #ubuntu IRC channel (see “Chatting on IRC” on 
page 367).
z
Ask a question on a mailing list (see “An IRC Alternative: Mailing Lists” 
on page 371).
z
Post a question on the Ubuntu forums (see “The Ubuntu Forums” on 
page 365).
From here on out, it’s up to you and the Ubuntu community to figure 
out what’s going on. Good luck fixing your problem!

If you have a netbook or some other com-
puter that doesn’t come with a CD drive, 
don’t worry: You can install Ubuntu using a 
USB flash drive. Booting from a USB drive can 
be a little more involved than simply booting from a 
CD or using Wubi, but once the installer is up and
running, the installation process is identical. I’m going to assume that you’re 
using Windows for the rest of this appendix, but it’s possible to create a USB 
install disk with other operating systems too; see https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/Installation/FromUSBStick/ for instructions.
NOTE
Some older computers don’t have the ability to boot from USB disks. If this is the case, you 
won’t be able to use this method to install Ubuntu. Other alternative installation methods 
are available, such as downloading Wubi directly; see https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/Installation/ for a list of options.

406
Appendix A
Preparing the Installer Files
First, you’re going to need a flash drive with sufficient capacity to hold the 
Ubuntu installer: About 2GB should do it. Make sure that you don’t have 
any files on the flash drive, either—you’ll be formatting the drive shortly, so any 
files on there will be permanently deleted.
Next, you’ll need to download an Ubuntu CD image. If you’re feeling 
clever, you can use your CD-burning software to make an .iso image from the CD 
provided with the book, but otherwise head over to http://www.ubuntu.com/
getubuntu/download/, select your location from the drop-down list, and click 
Begin Download to download an Ubuntu CD image. The image is large at 
around 700MB, so it might take a while to squeeze its way down your Internet 
connection.
Sometimes, large downloads don’t finish properly, and you could be left 
with an incomplete CD image. An easy (but not foolproof) way to check whether 
the image downloaded correctly is to open the folder where you saved it, right-
click the image, and select Properties. Check that the size of the image file is 
almost 700MB (690MB, say).
The final thing you need is the software used to put the installer onto the 
USB drive. Use your web browser to download the Universal USB Installer 
from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-
USB-Installer.exe.
Creating a Bootable Installer Disk
With the installation files downloaded, you’ll now be able to make a bootable 
Ubuntu flash disk. Plug your USB drive into the computer, and follow these 
instructions:
1.
Double-click the Universal-USB-Installer.exe file you just downloaded to 
run it.
2.
A License Agreement screen will appear. Click I Agree, and you’ll be 
taken to the Setup Your Selections page.
3.
Where it says Step 1, choose Try Some Other Live Linux ISO from the list.
4.
Click the Browse button under Step 2, and find the Ubuntu CD .iso image 
that you downloaded earlier. Click once to select it, and then click Open.
5.
Under Step 3, select your flash drive from the list (make sure it’s the 
right one; otherwise, you could wipe a bunch of important files from 
some other disk!), and check the box next to it to say that you want to 
format the drive. Your screen should now look like the one in Figure A-1.
6.
Click Create, and wait for a few minutes while the installer is put on the disk.
Once the process has finished, close the Universal USB Installer window, 
and safely eject your flash drive, as you normally would.

Installing Ubuntu from a USB Flash Drive
407
Figure A-1: Creating a bootable USB install disk
Booting from the USB Disk
Now, plug the flash drive back in, and restart the computer. This is where 
you find out whether you’re set up to boot from USB drives—if you get a 
purple Ubuntu boot screen, you’re all ready to go! The rest of the process 
will be the same as the usual installation from a CD, which you can read 
about in Chapter 2.
If the computer just boots back into Windows (or whatever operating system 
you’re using), you’ll need to change some settings to get it to boot from the 
flash drive. Restart the computer again, and look on the screen for text related 
to the boot order or BIOS settings for your computer. You’ll normally have to 
press a key (such as DELETE, F2, or ESC) to access these settings, but this very 
much depends on the make and model of your computer. More information 
on accessing your BIOS is given in Chapter 2.
Once you’ve found the settings screen, find the option where you can 
choose to boot from a USB drive (that is, make the USB drive the first boot 
device), save your changes, and restart. Ideally, you’ll now be taken to a 
purple Ubuntu boot screen. In that case, head over to Chapter 2, and con-
tinue the installation as normal.
If you run into any problems, take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/Installation/FromUSBStickQuick/ for hints and tips, or head over to 
the forums (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/) for advice.

As I mentioned in Chapter 1, the version 
of the Ubuntu Desktop CD that comes with 
this book is designed to work with i386 pro-
cessors, either in PCs or Intel-based Macs. It 
will also work with AMD64 or Intel Core 2 processors, 
albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to use Ubuntu with 
these processors (or any other machine based on AMD64
or EM64T architecture) in 64-bit mode, you must get a different disc on your 
own. There are several ways of doing this: downloading an ISO (disc image) 
and then burning it to CD yourself, ordering the CD from Ubuntu (for free), 
or ordering it from an online Linux CD provider (for a nominal cost).
Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to CD
To download an ISO of the Ubuntu Desktop CD, go to the Ubuntu website at 
http://www.ubuntu.com/, find the link to the download page, and then select 
and download the appropriate version for your machine. Remember that the 
ISO file you will be downloading is a heavyweight, weighing in at just under 

410
Appendix B
700MB, so the download will take a bit of time. Don’t count on getting it all 
downloaded and done before dinner . . . or, if you happen to be using a dial-up 
Internet connection, before dinner tomorrow. Yikes!
Burning the ISO to CD in Windows
Once the Ubuntu Desktop CD ISO has been downloaded, you need to burn 
it to CD before you can use it. Although Windows has built-in CD-writing 
capabilities, not all versions have the built-in ability to burn ISOs. To burn an 
ISO to CD in Windows 7, just right-click the ISO file, select Burn disc image, 
and then click the Burn button in the window that appears. In all other ver-
sions of Windows, however, you must use a third-party commercial application, 
such as Nero. If you don’t have a commercial disc-burning utility installed on 
your system, try the free and handy ISO Recorder.
To get ISO Recorder, visit http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm. 
Once the download is complete, double-click the ISORecorderSetup.msi file on 
your hard disk to install it. After the installation is complete, burn your ISO 
to CD by right-clicking the Ubuntu ISO file on your machine and selecting 
Open withISO Recorder in the pop-up menu. A CD Recording Wizard 
window will appear.
It is generally best if you burn installation or live CDs at a lower speed 
than the maximum speed allowed by your drive in order to reduce the chance 
of error (with 2X to 4X speeds considered optimal). To do so, make your 
choice from the Recording speed drop-down menu. Next, pop a blank CD 
into the drive, and click the Next button. The CD-burning process should 
begin. Once it’s done, the CD should pop out of the drive, and if all goes 
well, you’ll have yourself an AMD64-compatible live CD. You can then use it 
by following the directions at the beginning of Chapter 2 for using the live 
CD that comes with this book.
NOTE
If your CD does not seem to work, there could be a problem with the ISO file you 
downloaded. Find out by doing an integrity check as explained at https://
help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/.
Burning the ISO to CD in OS X
Although Ubuntu no longer comes in PowerPC editions, the i386 editions 
can be installed and run on Intel-based Macs. You can also, of course, down-
load ISOs for other architectures on your Mac and then burn them to CD for 
use on other machines.
To burn an ISO file to CD in OS X, first check to make sure the ISO image 
is not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disc in the 
area at the top portion of the left pane. If the disc is mounted, a drive icon 
will appear in that location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to 
that entry to eject, or unmount, it.
After that, click Applications in the same Finder window, and then look 
for and open the Utilities folder. In that folder, find and then double-click 
Disk Utility. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility window 

Ubuntu Desktop CDs for AMD64, Opteron, or Intel Core 2 Users
411
when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD ISO 
you just downloaded, and then drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility win-
dow, just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file appears 
in that list, click it once to highlight it.
To complete the process, click the Burn icon in the Disk Utility window’s 
toolbar, and then insert a blank CD in your drive when prompted to do so. 
Once the blank disc is inserted and recognized, you will be able to adjust the 
burn speed from the drop-down menu next to the word Speed. Select as low a 
speed as your hardware will allow, which, depending on the age of your Mac, 
will probably be 4X to 8X. Finally, click the Burn button in that same win-
dow, and the burning process will begin.
Ordering an Install Disc from Ubuntu
The easiest and most foolproof way to get an Ubuntu Desktop CD is to simply 
order one (or more) for free from Ubuntu; you don’t even have to pay ship-
ping or handling. Of course, the only downside to this approach is time. It 
can take up to ten weeks for you to get the CDs in this manner, so if you’re 
impatient, you might want to opt for one of the other methods. To order 
your install CDs from Ubuntu, go to https://shipit.ubuntu.com/, and follow the 
directions there. It’s easy.
If you need faster service or larger numbers of Ubuntu CDs and don’t 
mind paying a small amount for the service, then you can order your discs 
through the Canonical store instead (https://shop.canonical.com/).
Ordering an Install Disc from Other Online Sources
If you are in a hurry to get your install CD, you can also order a copy from an 
online source, such as CheapBytes (http://www.cheapbytes.com/) and OSDisc.com 
(http://www.osdisc.com/).


M A N U A L L Y  P A R T I T I O N I N G  
Y O U R  H A R D  D I S K
When you’re partitioning your hard disk 
with the Ubuntu installer, the first two 
options (use the whole disk and resize an 
existing partition) should cover most eventuali-
ties. They’re both discussed in Chapter 2. But if you’re 
in a geekier mood, there are a few fancy ways to carve
up your disk space. For example, you can create a shared data partition so 
your files can be shared between Windows and Ubuntu, or you can make a 
separate partition for your /home directory so you can reinstall Ubuntu (or 
install a different Linux distro) without having to fully back up all of your files.
When you get to the Prepare disk space screen of the installer, choose 
Specify partitions manually, and click Forward. You’ll be presented with a 
colored-bar view of your current partition setup (Figure C-1) and a list of 
your partitions below that. None of the changes that you make in this window 
will be applied until you click Forward again, and you can click the Back 
button if you want to forget about making the manual changes altogether. 
(There is one exception: Changes are made immediately and irreversibly 
when you resize a partition. See “Editing Existing Partitions” on page 416 for 
more on this.)

414
Appendix C
Figure C-1: Using the manual partitioning tool
Creating and Deleting Partitions
You can create new partitions only if you have some “free space” to put them 
in. This is free space in the sense that there’s not already a partition on that 
part of the disk, not that there are no files there. One way of creating free 
space is to delete an existing partition; to do this, click the list item for the 
partition, and click Delete. After a few seconds it’ll change into free space in 
the list (Figure C-2). Alternatively, if you’re planning to completely change 
your partition setup, select the hard disk you want to modify, and click New 
Partition Table. You’ll be left with a completely blank slate, where all you 
need to do is add new partitions.
Select any free space, and click Add to put a new partition in it. You’ll 
be presented with a Create new partition window (Figure C-3), which will 
ask how big you want to make the partition in megabytes. (1GB is roughly 
1,000MB.) See “Varieties of Partitions” on page 416 for advice on how big to 
make your partitions.
The Use as option lets you specify the filesystem you want to use. A filesystem 
tells your operating system how to store files on the partition. There are a 
number of different filesystems that you can choose, but not all of them can 
be understood by Windows and Mac OS. Ext4 is the best choice for a parti-
tion that will be solely used by Linux, but FAT32 is the one you need if you 
want to share files with Windows or Mac OS.

Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk
415
Figure C-2: Creating some free space
Figure C-3: Creating a new partition
You can also select the mount point, which is where Ubuntu will put the 
folder that corresponds to this partition (see Chapter 7 if you’re not familiar 
with how Linux organizes folders). For example, you would mount the home 
partition as the /home folder. More detail on mount points is given in “Varieties 
of Partitions” on page 416.
There are two more options in the Create new partition window, both 
of them rather technical and boring. The Type for the new partition option 
gives you a choice between creating a primary or logical partition. You can have 
a maximum of four primary partitions on a disk but lots of logical partitions—
the disk partitioner will choose the right option for you, so there’s no need 

416
Appendix C
to alter this setting (it doesn’t affect how you use the partition in any way). 
The other option, Location for the new partition, lets you choose where on 
the disk to put the new partition. It doesn’t really matter, so leave this option 
set to the default too.
Click OK to finish adding the partition; it should appear in the list after a 
few seconds.
Editing Existing Partitions
If you have an existing partition that you’d like to resize or change its mount 
point or filesystem type, select it and click Change. An Edit partition window 
will appear (Figure C-4).
The Use as and Mount point options work in the same way as those in 
the Create new partition window. You can also check Format the partition if 
you’d like all the data on it to be erased so you can start fresh. You have no 
choice but to format if you’re changing the filesystem of a partition (for 
example, from FAT32 to Ext4), so be aware of that too.
To resize the partition, use the New partition size in megabytes option. If 
you change the size and then click OK, you’ll be warned that the changes will 
be written to disk. Click Continue, and the partitioner will start to resize the 
partition immediately—you can’t undo this change, so think carefully about 
whether you’ve chosen the right options before hitting Continue.
Figure C-4: Editing a partition
Varieties of Partitions
You’ll need to be familiar with a few varieties of partitions when you manu-
ally partition your disk. I’ve summarized these in the following sections and 
provided some tips on choosing their size, mount points, and filesystems.
Root Partition
You must have a root partition; it’s where important system files are stored 
and software is installed. I recommend making it at least 8GB in size, but aim 
for 10GB to 15GB if you can to leave room for installing new programs. If 
you’re not going to have a separate home partition (described in a moment), 

Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk
417
all of your files will be stored in the root partition too, so you should make it 
as big as possible to accommodate all your stuff in that case. The mount point 
should be set to / and the filesystem to ext4.
Swap Partition
You must have a swap partition. The swap partition is like an extra area of sys-
tem memory (RAM); if your computer’s system memory gets full, it will start 
using this partition to handle the overspill. It’s also used to store the contents 
of your system memory (like all of your open files and programs) when you 
hibernate the computer. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq/ for 
more details on swap.
As a rough guide, it should be a little larger than the amount of RAM 
that your computer has. For example, if you have 2GB of RAM, make a 2.2GB 
swap partition. The filesystem should be set to swap area, and there’s no need 
to set a mount point.
NOTE
It’s possible to get away without a swap partition by creating a swap file after you’ve 
installed Ubuntu. The method for doing this is beyond the scope of this book.
Home Partition
The /home folder can be put in a separate partition. You don’t need to do this, 
but it’s useful if anything ever goes wrong and you need to reinstall Ubuntu—
all your personal files and configuration settings will be left intact on the home 
partition while Ubuntu is reinstalled on the root partition. This can save a lot 
of work when restoring your system. If you don’t have a separate home parti-
tion, the /home folder will be put in your root partition with everything else. 
The way you access your home folder (for example, through the Places menu) 
will be exactly the same whether you put it on a separate partition or not.
The home partition is where all your files and settings are stored, so you’ll 
want to make it as big as possible. The filesystem should be ext4, and the mount 
point should be set to /home.
Windows Partition
If you have Windows installed, you will need to resize the Windows partition 
to make room for Ubuntu. When you do this, be sure to leave at least enough 
disk space for Windows to function properly. Windows XP needs a partition 
at least 2GB in size, and for Vista and Windows 7 you should leave at least 
16GB. You will probably want to leave more space than this so that you can 
install programs and save files when using Windows, and remember to leave 
space for your existing Windows files too. The Used column in the main par-
titioning window will tell you how much space your Windows files are currently 
taking up.
Windows partitions will be of type NTFS or FAT32. Remember not to format 
the Windows partition, or your current installation of Windows will be erased.

418
Appendix C
Shared Partition
If you want an easy way to share files between Windows and Ubuntu, create a 
shared partition. In both operating systems, it will appear as a separate hard 
disk, which you can use to store whatever you like.
Make the partition as big as you think you’ll need: If you only ever copy 
small files between Ubuntu and Windows, then 1GB to 2GB should be plenty; 
if you want to permanently store all your Windows and Ubuntu files in there 
(sort of like a shared home folder), make it as big as possible. You should 
choose FAT32 as the filesystem, but you can use almost anything for the mount 
point—/windows will be one of the default suggestions, but you could type 
something like /shared or /blackhole into the Mount point box if you liked. Just 
make sure you use a name without any spaces in it.
Example Partition Layouts
Partitioning can be confusing if you’ve never done it before, so I’ve provided 
a few example partition layouts that should make things clearer. In all of these 
examples I’ve used a 100GB hard disk, but you can scale all the partition sizes 
up or down for your disk according to the advice in “Varieties of Partitions” 
on page 416.
Standard Ubuntu-Only Installation
Only Ubuntu will be installed on the disk, so only the root and swap partitions 
are needed (Figure C-5). Since I have 4GB of RAM, I made the swap partition 
4.2GB. The root partition filled up the rest of the disk space to give me as 
much room for files and programs as possible. (There was no need to parti-
tion the disk manually in this case; the Ubuntu installer’s Erase and use the 
entire disk option would have achieved the same result.)
Ubuntu-Only with a Separate Home Partition
Only Ubuntu will be installed, but there will be a separate home partition to 
keep my data safe in case I ever need to reinstall (Figure C-6). I’m planning 
to store home movies on this one, which means lots of very large files, so I 
went for a smallish 10GB root partition and a slightly undersized 4GB swap 
partition. This leaves lots more space for the home partition (and my videos), 
which takes up the remaining 86GB of the disk.

Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk

Figure C-5: A simple Ubuntu-only partition layout
Figure C-6: The partition layout for Ubuntu with a separate home partition

420
Appendix C
Ubuntu and Windows with a Shared Partition
Ubuntu will be installed alongside Windows XP, and I want a shared parti-
tion so that I can copy files between the two operating systems (Figure C-7). 
My existing Windows installation was using 7.3GB of the disk because I had 
files and programs installed on it. I resized the Windows installation to 
15GB, leaving 7.7GB of space free for future expansion. Note that the Win-
dows partition will not be formatted, so Windows and all my files on that par-
tition remain intact. I created a 40GB Ubuntu root partition and a 4.2GB 
swap partition and then created a shared FAT32 partition in the remaining 
40GB or so of disk space.
Figure C-7: Ubuntu, Windows, and a shared partition
Finishing Up
When you’ve finished, click Forward to finalize your changes. If you’re delet-
ing or formatting any partitions, the changes will be written to disk. This is an 
irreversible change, so make sure you backed up any valuable data that was 
on the affected partitions!

R E S O U R C E S
Because Linux owes much of its growth 
and development to the Internet, it should 
come as no surprise that there is a wealth of 
information about the various flavors of Linux, 
including Ubuntu, available to you online. In addition 
to the usual news, how-to, and download sites, you will 
also find a variety of tutorials, forums, blogs, and other 
sources of useful information—all of which you can 
turn to as you use and learn more about your system.
Forums
When you are looking for advice, trying to solve a particular problem, or just 
looking for some general tips, online forums are the way to go. Fortunately, 
Ubuntu has a forum all its own, and since Ubuntu is primarily a desktop-
oriented Linux distro, you are likely to find many fellow newbies and newbie-
friendly posters there, rather than the hard-core geekiness you might find on 

422
Appendix D
some other sites. There are, of course, other newbie-friendly forums, which, 
although not Ubuntu-specific, should also be able to provide you with lots of 
helpful information.
Regardless of which forum you are posting in, just be sure to mention 
that you are using Ubuntu, which version you have (Lucid Lynx, in case you 
forgot), and that you are new to Linux. And remember to always seek clarifi-
cation when you get an answer you don’t understand. The same poster will 
usually come back and clarify things for you. You should feel right at home at 
most of these sites, though you will probably come to like one or two more 
than the others.

Magazines
If you are more of a tactile type who enjoys the feel of paper pressed between 
your fingers, then you might want to turn to some of the Linux magazines 
available at most major newsstands. All have a good deal of online content, 
so even if you’re not interested in the pleasures of holding a magazine in 
your hand, their sites are worth checking out.

issues)

Resources
425
There are two (unrelated) magazines sharing almost the same name: 
One of these is from the United States; the other is from Europe. Newbies 
who want some pizzazz in their reading materials, plus some useful tips and 
some things to play around with, should go for the European version. The 
U.S. version is targeted toward business users and power geeks, not newbies.
Books
Once you’ve finished working through this book, you should be able to do 
just about whatever you want in Ubuntu. Still, your interest may have been 
piqued enough that you want to find out a bit more about Linux. Here are 
some books that might help in that quest:
How Linux Works by Brian Ward (No Starch Press, 2004)
The Debian System by Martin Krafft (No Starch Press, 2005)
The Linux Cookbook 2nd Ed. by Michael Stutz (No Starch Press, 2004)
Running Linux by Matthias Dalheimer and Matt Welsh (O’Reilly Media, 
2005)
Linux Multimedia Hacks: Tips & Tools for Taming Images, Audio, and Video 
by Kyle Rankin (O’Reilly Media, 2005)
Linux Pocket Guide by Daniel J. Barrett (O’Reilly Media, 2004)
Ubuntu CDs
To order an AMD64 version of the Ubuntu Desktop CD, get a replacement 
for the i386 version that comes with this book, or get the next version of 
Ubuntu when it comes out (if you don’t want to or can’t download it), just 
place an order with any of the following sites. (CDs from most suppliers will 
cost $5 to $10 or so.)

MY NEW
™ iPAD
A User’s Guide
by WALLACE WANG
Apple’s iPad has revolutionized the way consumers experience the Web, 
email, photos, and video. As with all Apple gadgets, the basic features are 
easy to access and understand. But there’s a world of possibility beyond the 
basics, and many users need guidance to make the most of their iPads. My 
New iPad takes readers step by step through the iPad’s many useful features—
like surfing the Internet, sending email, listening to music, taking notes, 
reading ebooks, using iWork, and playing with digital photos. And since no 
one wants to read a long, dry textbook to learn how to use their new toy, 
author Wallace Wang takes a practical, easy-to-follow approach and keeps 
the tone light.

FORBIDDEN LEGO
Build the Models Your Parents Warned You Against!
by ULRIK PILEGAARD and MIKE DOOLEY
Written by a former master LEGO designer and a former LEGO project man-
ager, this full-color book showcases projects that break the LEGO Group’s 
rules for building with LEGO bricks—rules against building projects that fire 
projectiles, require cutting or gluing bricks, or use nonstandard parts. Many 
of these are back-room projects that LEGO’s master designers build under 
the LEGO radar, just to have fun. Learn how to build a catapult that shoots 
M&Ms, a gun that fires LEGO beams, a continuous-fire ping-pong ball 
launcher, and more!

THE MANGA GUIDE
™ TO PHYSICS
System and Network Monitoring
by HIDEO NITTA, KEITA TAKATSU, and TREND-PRO CO, LTD.
The Manga Guide to Physics teaches readers the fundamentals of physics 
through authentic Japanese manga. Megumi, an all-star tennis player, is 
struggling to pass her physics class. Luckily for her, she befriends Ryota, a 
patient physics geek who uses real-world examples to help her understand 
classical mechanics. Readers follow along with Megumi as she learns about 
the physics of everyday objects like roller skates, slingshots, braking cars, 
and tennis rackets. As the book progresses, Megumi begins to master even 
the toughest concepts of physics, like momentum and impulse, parabolic 
motion, and the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Using a 
lively and quirky approach, The Manga Guide to Physics combines a whimsical 
story with real educational content so that readers will quickly master the 
core concepts of physics with a minimum of frustration.

ing their own robots. Readers learn how to build Strider, a six-legged walking 
creature; the CCC, a climbing vehicle; the Hybrid Brick Sorter, a robot that 
sorts by color and size; the Snatcher, an autonomous robotic arm; and more!

“A fast, crystal-clear topical tour of the amazing 
collective accomplishment embodied in Ubuntu.”
—Cory Doctorow, Boing Boing
The Ubuntu Linux distribution makes Linux easy, and 
Ubuntu for Non-Geeks makes it even easier. Full of 
tips, tricks, and helpful pointers, this guide is perfect 
for those interested in—but nervous about—switching 
to the Linux operating system.
This edition is packed with new material covering all the 
latest features of Ubuntu. It includes five new chapters that 
take you through common tasks like installing and playing 
games, troubleshooting common hardware and software 
problems, and more.
By following along with the book’s straightforward 
explanations and step-by-step projects, you’ll learn the 
basics and beyond, including how to:
• Install Ubuntu and keep it updated
• Set up printers, scanners, USB flash drives, iPods, 
iPhones, and other devices
• Edit and share digital photos and videos
• Create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations
• Work with the command line (or avoid it altogether!)
If you’re looking for a pain-free way to learn Linux, Ubuntu 
for Non-Geeks is just what you need to get started.
