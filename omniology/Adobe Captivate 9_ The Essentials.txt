Book Conventions
I believe that learners learn by doing. With that simple concept in mind, IconLogic 
books are created by trainers/authors with years of experience training adult 
learners. Before IconLogic books, our instructors rarely found a book that was 
perfect for a classroom setting. If the book was beautiful, odds were that the text 
was too small to read and hard to follow. If the text in a book was the right size, the 
quality of exercises left something to be desired. 
Finally tiring of using inadequate materials, our instructors started teaching without 
any books at all. Years ago we had many students ask if the in-class instruction 
came from a book. If so, they said they’d buy the book. That sparked an idea. We 
asked students—just like you—what they wanted in a training manual. You 
responded, and that methodology is used in this book and every IconLogic training 
manual. 
This book has been divided into several modules. Because each module builds on 
lessons learned in a previous module, I recommend that you complete each module 
in succession. Each module guides you through lessons step-by-step. Here is the 
lesson key:

instructions for you to follow look like this
If you are expected to type anything or if something is important, it is set in bold 
type like this:

type 9 into the text field
When you are asked to press a key on your keyboard, the instruction looks like this:

Confidence Checks
As you move through the lessons in this book, you will come 
across the little guy at the right. He indicates a Confidence 
Check. Throughout each module, you are guided through 
hands-on, step-by-step exercises. But at some point you’ll have 
to fend for yourself. That is where Confidence Checks come in. 
Please be sure to complete each of the challenges because some 
exercises build on completed Confidence Checks.
Book Requirements 
This workbook teaches you how to use Adobe Captivate version 9. The Adobe 
Captivate software does not come with this book. The software can be downloaded 
directly from Adobe (www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html). You do not 
need to purchase Captivate to learn Captivate; the free trial version of the software 
can be downloaded via the link above. The only limitation on the trial is that it lasts 
for 30 days from the day you first run the software on your computer.
Besides a computer and Adobe Captivate 9, here’s what else you need to use this 
book:
Microphone, Speakers, and/or a Headset: During the module on Audio, which 
begins on page 139, you will learn how to import, record, and edit audio. You will 
need a microphone and speakers or a headset to complete those activities.
eLearning Assets: Captivate comes with several images (known as Characters) 
and Themes. To ensure you have all of the assets you need to complete the lessons 
in this book, download and install the eLearning Assets via the link at 
www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=captivate.
NeoSpeech: You will learn how to convert written text into an audio file during 
activities beginning on page 157. To use the NeoSpeech Text-To-Speech feature, 
you will need to install the NeoSpeech software after installing Captivate. NeoSpeech 
comes free with Captivate but is not installed during the Captivate installation 
process. You can download NeoSpeech from www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/
index.cfm?product=captivate. 
Some people have a hard time finding the eLearning Assets and NeoSpeech 
download links because they aren’t shown in a drop-down menu. Look for this 
paragraph: “Adobe Captivate 9.0 comes with a wide range of assets which can be 
used to create great looking eLearning content.” You’ll find the download link in that 
paragraph.
Microsoft PowerPoint: PowerPoint 2007 or newer is preferred. PowerPoint, which 
does not come with Captivate, is used during the PowerPoint integration activities 
beginning on page 188. If PowerPoint is not installed, you will not be able to 
complete all of the activities.
Microsoft Word 2007 or newer: Word, which does not come with Captivate, is 
used during activities beginning on page 237. If Word is not installed, you will not 
be able to complete all of the activities.

How Software Updates Affect This Book
This book was written specifically to teach you how to use Adobe Captivate 
version 9.0. At the time this book was written, Captivate 9 was the latest and 
greatest version of the Captivate software available from Adobe.
With each major release of Captivate, my intention is to write a new book to support 
that version and make it available within 30-60 days of the software being released 
by Adobe. From time to time, Adobe makes service releases/patches of Captivate 
available for customers that fix bugs or add functionality. For instance, I would 
expect Adobe to update Captivate with a patch or two within a few months of 
Captivate 9 being released. That patched version might be called Captivate 9.01 or 
9.1. Usually these updates are minor (bug fixes) and have little or no impact on the 
lessons presented in this book. However, Adobe sometimes makes significant 
changes to the way Captivate looks or behaves, even with minor patches. (Such was 
the case when Adobe updated Captivate from version 5 to 5.5—about a dozen 
features were added, and a few panels were actually renamed, throwing readers of 
my books into a tizzy.)
Because it is not possible for me to recall and update printed books, some 
instructions you are asked to follow in this book may not match the patched/updated 
version of Captivate that you might be using. If something on your screen does not 
match what I am showing in the book, please visit the Adobe Captivate 9 product 
page on my website for possible updates (http://www.iconlogic.com/adobe-
captivate-9-essentials-workbook.html).

Education Through Pictures
In a previous life, I was a professional photographer. When I wasn’t snapping photos 
during a five-year tour with the U.S. Coast Guard, I covered media events in New 
York City as a freelance photographer. 
Just about any photographer will tell you that the goal when taking pictures is to 
capture a story with a few, or maybe just one, photograph. I’m betting that you have 
heard the saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” more than once. As a 
professional photographer, I lived those words.
I have spent the bulk of my career attempting to perfect the art of teaching 
complex concepts to busy, distracted adult learners. I have always attempted to 
write documentation using as few words as possible and to teach lessons as 
efficiently as possible. 
If you are in the business of educating, you know how difficult the job of writing 
relevant lesson plans with fewer and fewer words can be. My step-by-step workbooks 
have long been known for their “skills-and-drills learning” approach. The term “skills-
and-drills” learning means different things to different people. For some, it means 
fast-moving lessons that do not drown a person with unnecessary information. For 
me, “skills-and-drills learning” means learning something by doing, whatever that 
something is. It also means learning with a heavy dose of imagery instead of a heavy 
dose of text.
I learned long ago that people tend to think not with words but with pictures. Here’s 
an example of what I mean.
Close your eyes for a second and picture three in your mind’s eye. Open your 
eyes after a few seconds and read on. (See how precise I am? I know that 
some of you would have closed your eyes, kept them closed, and then fallen 
fast asleep without the last instruction.)
I wasn’t specific when I asked you to picture three was I? Because I didn’t tell you 
how to picture three, it’s a good bet that things such as three cupcakes, three bowls 
of ice cream, or three big boxes of Cap'n Crunch (everyone knows that the Cap’n is 
the best breakfast cereal ever) flashed into your mind’s eye. Maybe a large numeral 
3 appeared in your mind’s eye—not the word “three.” In fact, I doubt that you 
visualized the word three. Why? As I said above, people think in terms of pictures, 
not words. That’s the reason my books usually contain hundreds of screen captures 
that visually explain a concept that might have taken several paragraphs to explain. 
And when I do have to explain a concept, I make every effort to minimize the chatter 
and get right to the point.

RoboDemo to Captivate
A picture can be nice, but it’s static. No matter how good a picture is, it is limited in 
its ability to convey detailed information or concepts. Knowing this limitation, I 
searched for a program I could use to augment the activities presented in my books. 
I was specifically looking for a program that would make the lessons in my books 
come to life and allow me to create software simulations.
Over the years, I have found several programs that I like. The programs capture 
videos of my computer screen and mouse actions well enough, but the resulting 
lessons were huge. A five-minute eLearning lesson could easily gobble up nearly 100 
megabytes of storage space on my web server. Downloading a file that large via the 
Internet could take a lot of time, even with a fast Internet connection.
Large file sizes were just one part of the problem. The output published by the early 
eLearning tools were not cross-platform (meaning that they would not work on both 
Macs and PCs running Windows). And the first eLearning lessons I created were 
videos that were not capable of being interactive. I firmly believe that showing 
something to learners isn’t the same as teaching learners a skill and letting them 
actually perform the skill.
Early eLearning technology was so bad that I gave up on the idea and decided to wait 
until someone came up with a “killer” application. That program began life simply 
enough as a little utility called Flashcam (by Nexus Concepts, 2002). Flashcam was a 
simple screen capture application that made quick work of capturing just about 
anything you could do on your computer. Flashcam soon became the property of 
eHelp Software and was renamed RoboDemo. At that point, RoboDemo could be 
used to create sophisticated software demonstrations and interactive simulations.
eHelp Software was responsible for RoboDemo versions 3 through 5. After that,   
Macromedia (of Dreamweaver and Flash fame) acquired eHelp Software. Macromedia 
revamped RoboDemo, added even more awesome features, and changed the name 
of the program from RoboDemo to Captivate.
In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia. Hence, the program has been known 
as Adobe Captivate. Adobe’s first version of Captivate was Adobe Captivate 2.
If you’re totally new to Adobe Captivate, the first thing you need to know is what the 
program is used to create. Microsoft Word creates documents. Adobe InDesign 
creates brochures, newspapers, and magazines. Adobe Acrobat creates PDFs. So 
what’s up with Captivate? Using Adobe Captivate, you can create eLearning courses 
about anything! Need to create an online lesson about terrorism awareness? How 
about a course on conflict resolution? How about a simulation teaching colleagues 
how to attach a file to an email created in Microsoft Outlook? You can use Captivate 
to create eLearning for all of these... an endless number of subjects. The eLearning 
content you create with Captivate can be interactive—you can include text, rollover 
areas, clickable hotspots, quizzes, typing areas, sound effects, videos, special 
effects, audio, and more. 
Finished Adobe Captivate projects can be published as Flash (SWF), HTML5, Word 
documents, PDFs, and videos. The lessons you publish can be viewed by a consumer 
via a Macintosh or a Windows-based PC. Learners can consume your content via a 
corporate web server, YouTube, Vimeo, mobile device (iPads, iPhones, Android, 
Kindle Fire, etc.), and even Adobe Reader (if you publish a lesson as a PDF).

Planning eLearning Projects
By the time you finish the last lesson, you should be able to use Captivate to create 
some compelling, technically sound eLearning lessons. However, publishing 
technically sound content does not necessarily mean creating good eLearning. If you 
want to create good, useful lessons, you have to plan ahead. Before creating a 
Captivate project, clarify the following:
Why are you creating an eLearning course in the first place? You’d be 
surprised how many people start Captivate and just start creating content. 
This kind of development process might be well-intentioned, but you really 
need to map out the entire course, including how you are going to track 
learner comprehension (if that’s important to you). During the mapping 
process, you might come to the conclusion that your course simply isn’t 
appropriate for eLearning and move on to another course.
Who is your audience? The way you teach children is different from the way 
you teach adults. For instance, children need praise and encouragement 
during the learning process that an adult learner might find annoying, if not 
down-right obnoxious.
What exactly are you teaching, and is it appropriate for eLearning? Not 
every lesson in an instructor-led lesson can be effectively re-tooled as an 
eLearning lesson. For instance, if a course relies on breakout groups, group 
discussion, or collaborative work, those aspects of the course cannot be 
included in eLearning. Keep in mind that eLearners almost always work on 
their own with little or no interaction with a colleague.
Does your project need to accommodate learners with disabilities? If the 
answer is yes, you should budget approximately 30 percent more time to 
produce each lesson. Although it’s not difficult to create accessible 
eLearning, it takes time.
Do you want your projects to contain images and background music? If so, 
where will you get them? Also, are you going to use a template? If so, who 
is going to design/create it?
Will there be captions (written instructions and descriptions)? If so, who will 
write the content for these captions? Do you need an eLearning script? Do 
you need a voice-over script?
Is your course soft-skills, or is it a software simulation? If it is soft-skills, 
does it make sense to create most of the content in Microsoft PowerPoint 
and then import the presentation into Captivate?

Budgeting Considerations
Many new eLearning developers underestimate the time needed to produce Captivate 
projects. Although it is certainly easier and faster to create eLearning content than 
ever before, it still takes time. To determine your level of effort, the first thing you 
need to know is how long you want your eLearning course to play (in minutes.) Once 
you have that number, you can calculate your level of effort.
Let’s estimate how long it might to take to create a 60-minute eLearning course. 
Because you should not create a single Captivate project that, when published, plays 
for 60 consecutive minutes, it’s ideal to break the 60 minutes of content into 
manageable chunks. I’d suggest that each chunk play for no more than five 
minutes. In that case, you will have 12 Captivate projects, each playing for five-
minutes. 
You need to design and then write the content for the course so you will need a script 
and/or storyboard. If there’s going to be voice-over audio (I’d encourage you to 
include voice-over audio), you’ll need a voice-over script. 
Storyboards are rough sketches that show the general content of your project, slide 
by slide. If your projects contain more screen shots of an application than captions, a 
storyboard is a good idea. 
Scripts are detailed step-by-step procedures. These are ideal if your project will 
contain a significant number of Text Captions. 
Voice-over scripts are important because you don’t want the narrator simply 
reading aloud the text displayed on the screen. Studies have shown that a narrator 
simply reading the text being displayed is a distraction to the learner.
It could take at least three hours to write a script to support a five-minute eLearning 
lesson. Therefore, you should budget at least 36 hours to write the entire one-hour 
eLearning course (12x3=36). Depending on how fast you write, you could easily 
double those hours, meaning you may need to budget approximately 80 hours for 
writing.
When creating content in Captivate, you can and should begin with a project 
template. A template is essentially a completed shell project that you will use as the 
basis of all of your projects. It’s not difficult to create a template, but it takes time. 
An ideal template contains placeholders, an introduction slide, transitional slides, a 
conclusion slide, a skin, and appropriate Start and End Properties (although these 
terms may seem foreign to you now, you will learn about many of them as you move 
through the lessons presented in this book).
In my experience, writing a voice-over script is easier than writing a step-by-step 
script for recording a software simulation (voice-over scripts typically take me 50 
percent less time to write). If you spent 80 hours writing the script, you should 
budget 40 hours to write the voice-over script.
Once the voice-over script is done, you’ll also need to include time for recording the 
audio narration (voice-overs), making corrections to the step-by-step script post-
rehearsal, and recording the lessons using Captivate (the recording time should take 
the same amount of time as the process being recorded).
As I mentioned above, at two hours of production for every minute of eLearning, it 
could easily take 10 hours to produce a five-minute Captivate lesson. During the 
production process, you will likely need to add and/or edit text captions (which you 
will learn about beginning on page 66). Typical Captivate projects include interactive 
objects, such as Click Boxes (page 179), Buttons (page 32), and Text Entry Boxes 

Preface > Budgeting Considerations

(page 183). And a typical project should include a quiz to measure learner 
comprehension of the content (you will learn about quizzes beginning on page 199).
During the production process, you’ll likely add audio clips to the project’s 
background, individual slides, and even objects on individual slides. It’s also likely 
that you’ll either record voice-over audio (or use Captivate’s Text to Speech feature 
to convert written text to voice-over audio. And you’ll likely need to edit the audio 
files by performing such common tasks as removing unwanted noise. (You will learn 
to work with audio on page 139.)
Finally, you’ll need to publish the finished project into any one of several output 
formats, possibly uploading those files to a server or Learning Management System 
(LMS) and testing for scoring or interactivity errors. After that, you’ll need to fix 
problems (and there will likely be plenty of problems that need to be fixed). After 
fixing those problems, you’ll need to republish, repost, and then retest. (You will 
learn to Publish projects beginning on page 225.)
Your eLearning development budget (to create a 60-minute eLearning course) might 
look something like this:
40-80 hours to write an eLearning script or create the storyboard to 
support 12, five-minute lessons for a one-hour course.
120 hours to edit, produce, and test 12, five-minute lessons (two-hours for 
every minute of playtime).
20-40 hours to write a narration script to be used by your narrator.
20-40 hours to record and enhance voice narration (less if you use Text to 
Speech, which you will learn about on page 157).

Project Size and Display Resolution
When you create a blank Captivate project or record a software simulation, you’ll 
need to set the project’s width and height. For instance, in the second module 
(page 24), you create a blank project and set its size to 800 x 600. That size is 
perfectly fine for learners who access your content via a desktop computer with a 
typical monitor (typical meaning a 15-17 inch monitor). 
Several years ago, monitors were small and display resolutions were low. In fact, a 
display resolution of 800 x 600 pixels was common. If you developed eLearning 
content for a display that small, a project size of 640 x 480 was ideal. A few years 
later, 1024 x 768 was the standard display resolution, resulting in typical eLearning 
lessons sized to 800 x 600.
According to w3schools.com, the standard desktop screen resolution today is 1366 
x 768, and it’s trending higher. (You'll find that available resolutions vary from 
system to system. For instance, I use an HP 22-inch display that doesn't support 
1366 x 768. Instead, my closest options are 1360 x 768 and 1376 x 812.)
Because screen resolutions are higher than ever, many eLearning developers are 
seeking an optimal viewing experience for learners. But what’s the ideal size for an 
eLearning lesson? Unfortunately, there isn't a cookie-cutter answer. The size of the 
lesson you create depends largely on the size of your display and its resolution. If 
you are recording a software simulation, the size of your project might be dependent 
upon the size of the software you’re recording (some software cannot be resized and 
may to take up your whole display).
There’s more to consider when it comes to project size. What kind of device are your 
learners using? How big is their display? Is their device typically used vertically 
(portrait) or horizontally (landscape)? What is the typical size of an iPad? How about 
a Surface Pro?
If you are creating content for learners using standard desktop computers (Windows 
or Mac), your 800 x 600 project might look fine. However, if you upload your content 
to YouTube, 800 x 600 won't look right (you will see black bars on one or both sides 
of the video, and the video might look distorted during playback).
Selecting an ideal project size is a delicate balancing act between the size of the 
capture area and an ideal screen resolution. When I create YouTube videos, I set 
Captivate’s recording size to 1280 x 720 and my computer’s screen resolution fairly 
high. Although I could go higher with my screen resolution and capture more of my 
screen, the captured screen text at a higher screen resolution tends to be small and 
difficult for most people to read.
When the time comes to Publish your Captivate project, there is an option called 
Scalable HTML content. 
When you publish your project with Scalable HTML content enabled, learners with 
large screens similar to yours will see your lesson pretty much at full size. For other 
learners, the lesson will automatically scale up or down to fit their screen. In short, 
Scalable HTML content takes away much of the anxiety you’ll have to contend with 
when it comes to project size. For that reason, I encourage you to ensure that 
Scalable HTML Content is always enabled when publishing. (When developing your 
eLearning course, consider using a font and font size that remains readable when 
small. Imagine how tiny the text could become if a learner uses a smart phone.)

Designing Slides in Captivate
As you begin to work in Captivate to develop standard (not video) projects, the 
program will likely seem very familiar to you... sort of like Microsoft PowerPoint. If 
you’ve used PowerPoint you are familiar with the Filmstrip showing miniatures of the 
slides along the left side of the PowerPoint interface. Captivate is similar. In fact, like 
PowerPoint, you create individual slides in Captivate and populate those slides with 
text, images, animation... just about anything.
You don't have to be a seasoned designer to produce beautiful and effective 
Captivate slides. Here are a few tips to get you started:
There are occasions when a bulleted list is the best way to convey an idea. 
Although PowerPoint uses a bulleted approach to information by default, 
you do not have to use that format in eLearning. 
Try splitting the bullets into separate slides with a single image to illustrate 
each point, or forgo the text altogether and replace it with a chart, diagram, 
or other informative image.
It is not necessary to have every bit of information you cover on one slide. 
Encourage your audience to listen and, if necessary, take notes based on 
what you say, not what is shown on the slide. 
Nothing says “High School Presentation Circa 1997” quite like a dancing 
animated image clumsily plopped on a rainbow gradient background with a 
big, garish image.
Few learners are impressed with how many moving, colorful objects each 
slide contains. When it comes to eLearning, the old saying, “content is 
King,” has never been more appropriate. Ensure each of your slides 
contains relevant, need-to-know information and that the information is 
presented as clutter-free as possible.
Consider taking more of a photographic approach to the images you use. 
You can easily find stock photographs on the web using any one of a 
number of pay-for-use websites. There are many free sites, but keep in 
mind that to save time and frustration (and improve on the selection and 
quality), you might want to set aside a budget to pay for images.

Fonts and eLearning
There is no denying that the most important thing about eLearning is solid content. 
But could you be inadvertently making your content harder to read and understand 
by using the wrong fonts? Is good font selection really important? Read on to 
discover the many surprising ways fonts can affect your content.
Some Fonts Read Better On-Screen
eCommerce Consultant Dr. Ralph F. Wilson did a study in 2001 to determine if serif 
fonts (fonts with little lines on the tops and bottoms of characters, such as Times 
New Roman) or sans serif fonts (those without lines, such as Arial) were more suited 
to being read on computer monitors. His study concluded that although Times New 
Roman is easily read in printed materials, the lower resolution of monitors (72 dots 
per inch (dpi) versus 180 dpi or higher) makes it much more difficult to read in digital 
format. Arial 12 pt was pitted against Times New Roman 12 pt with respondents 
finding the sans serif Arial font more readable at a rate of two to one.
Wilson also tested the readability of Arial versus Verdana on computer screens and 
found that in font sizes greater than 10 pt, Arial was more readable, whereas 
Verdana was more readable in font sizes 10 pt and smaller.
So should you stop using Times New Roman in your eLearning lessons? Not 
completely. For instance, you can still use Times New Roman for text content that is 
not expected to be skimmed over quickly or read in a hurry.

Some Fonts Increase Trust
A 2008 study by Sharath Sasidharan and Ganga Dhanesh for the Association of 
Information Systems found that typography can affect trust in eCommerce. The 
study found that to instill trust in online consumers, you should keep it simple: “To 
the extent possible, particularly for websites that need to engage in financial 
transactions or collect personal information from their users, the dominant typeface 
used to present text material should be a serif or sans serif font such as Times New 
Roman or Arial.”
If you feel your eLearning content will be presented to a skeptical audience (or one 
you've never worked with before), dazzling them with fancy fonts may not be the 
way to go. You can use fancy fonts from time to time to break up the monotony of a 
dry lesson, but consider using such non-standard fonts sparingly. Use the fancy fonts 
for headings or as accents but not for the bulk of your text.
The Readability of Fonts Affects Participation
A study done at the University of Michigan in 2008 on typecase in instructions found 
that the ease with which a font in instructional material is read can have an impact 
on the perceived skill level needed to complete a task.
The study found that if directions are presented in a font that is deemed more 
difficult to read, “the task will be viewed as being difficult, taking a long time to 
complete and perhaps, not even worth trying.”
The results of the study by Wilson indicate that it is probably not a good idea to 
present eLearning material, especially to beginners, in a Times New Roman font, as it 
may make the information seem too difficult to process or overwhelming.
Popular eLearning Fonts
I polled my “Skills & Drills” newsletter readers and asked which fonts they tended to 
use in eLearning. Here is a list of the most popular fonts:
Verdana
Helvetica
Arial
Calibri
Times
Palatino
Times New Roman
Century Schoolbook (for print)

Fonts and Personas
If you are creating eLearning for business professionals, you might want to use a 
different font in your design than you would if you were creating eLearning for high 
school students. But what font would you use if you want to convey a feeling of 
happiness? Formality? Cuddliness?
In a study (funded by Microsoft) by A. Dawn Shaikh, Barbara S. Chaparro, and Doug 
Fox, the perceived personality traits of fonts were categorized. The table below 
shows the top three fonts for each personality objective.

The Captivate Interface
As you work through the lessons in this book, the goal is to get you comfortable with 
each specific Captivate area or feature before proceeding. Like any feature-rich 
program, mastering Captivate is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. Soon enough 
you’ll be in full stride, creating awesome eLearning content using Captivate. But 
before the sprint comes the crawl. During these first few activities, I’d like to give you 
a chance to familiarize yourself with Captivate’s user interface. Specifically, you’ll be 
instructed to start Captivate, open an existing project, and poke around Captivate’s 
interface a bit. 
Student Activity: Explore a Finished Captivate Project
1. Start Adobe Captivate. 
The process of starting a program varies slightly from operating system to 
operating system. Because Captivate is available for both the Macintosh and 
Windows, I’ll leave it to you to start the program using any technique you’re 
comfortable with. 
Once Captivate starts, you’ll see the Home screen consisting of two tabs: 
Recent and New. The Recent tab will be blank until after you have opened or 
created a project. Shown below is the Macintosh version of Adobe Captivate 9.
Captivate is nearly identical on the Windows and Macintosh operating 
systems. Nevertheless, there are some differences between the two versions, 
and I’ll point them out as you work through this book.
Note: You are about to open a Captivate project from the group of 
assets (data files) that support the lessons in this book. If you have not 
yet downloaded and installed the Captivate9Data files, turn to the 
About This Book Section and complete the “Data Files (Captivate 
Project Assets)” activity that begins on page x before moving on to the 
next step.

2. Open a project from the Captivate9Data folder.
click the Recent tab
from the bottom left of the tab, click the Browse button
The Open dialog box appears.
navigate to the Captivate9Data folder and open AceInterview.cptx
3. Close the project and reopen it using the Recent tab.
choose File > Close (do not save the project if prompted)
The Captivate Home screen has two tabs: New and Recent. Once you’ve 
opened and then closed a project, the Recent tab gives you quick access to 
those recently used projects.
on the Home screen, click the Recent tab
double-click AceInterview to reopen the project
Note: Alternatively, you can open existing Captivate projects via File > 
Open or click the Browse button on the Recent tab.

Student Activity: Zoom and Magnify
1. Ensure that the AceInterview project is still open.
2. Zoom away from a slide.
choose View > Magnification > 50%
You can zoom as far away as 25 percent and as up close and personal as 400 
percent. At a 50 percent view, it’s a good bet you can see the Filmstrip at the 
left, a slide in the middle of the Captivate window, and a gray area 
surrounding the slide. The gray area is known as the Pasteboard. You can 
drop any slide object on the Pasteboard and leave it there indefinitely. When 
an object is on the Pasteboard, it will not appear in the published version of 
your lesson, nor will it preview (you’ll learn to both publish and preview later).
3. Zoom closer to a slide.
choose View > Zoom in a few times
As you select the Zoom in command, you get closer to the slide.
choose View > Zoom in two or three more times to get a little closer to 
the slide
4. Change the slide zoom to Best Fit.
choose View > Magnification > Best Fit
Depending on the size of the Captivate window on your computer screen, and 
your monitor’s display resolution, the best Best Fit command is an ideal view 
when working within Captivate. 
The Pasteboard is the gray space you see surrounding the slide. You can drop slide 
objects here until you are ready to use them.

17
Student Activity: Navigate a Project
1. Ensure that the AceInterview project is still open.
2. Switch slides using the Filmstrip.
at the left of the Captivate window, scroll up or down the Filmstrip as 
necessary until you see the thumbnail view of slide 7
on the Filmstrip, click one time on slide 7 to view the slide in the middle of 
the Captivate window
Once a slide is open in the main area of the Captivate window, you can select 
any of the slide’s objects and manipulate them. For instance, you can edit 
slide text, add images, delete images, add a button, change an object’s 
timing, etc. If you need to change the attributes of one or more slides, you do 
not need to have it open within the main Captivate interface. Instead, you can 
select one or more slides on the Filmstrip and change their Properties at one 
time.
3. Jump to a slide using the Go to slide field.
from the Captivate menu bar at the top of the window, highlight the 
number you see in the current slide field
type any slide number between 1 and 23
Note: If you don’t see the Page Number field as shown in the image 
above, try enlarging the Captivate window. When the Captivate window 
is small, some menu items are cropped from view.

4. Jump between slides using your keyboard.
with any of the slides on the Filmstrip selected, press either [page up] or 
[page down] on your keyboard
As you press the keys, notice that you quickly move from slide to slide.
Note: If you are using a Macintosh laptop, such as a MacBook Pro 
without [page up] or [page down] keys, try pressing the up and 
down arrows on the lower right of your keyboard to move from slide to 
slide.

19
Student Activity: Explore and Reset the Workspace
1. Ensure that the AceInterview project is still open.
2. Explore the Properties Inspector and the Library.
from the top right of the Captivate window, click Properties
A panel opens at the right of the Captivate window. As you move through the 
lessons in this book, you’ll be using this area frequently. I’ve heard people 
refer to Captivate panels by all kinds of names. Is it a pod? Is it a panel? Is it 
Superman? (I just dated myself with that one.) I promise that there won’t be 
a test about this stuff later, so pick a name for these Captivate areas that 
works for you. According to my contact at Adobe, each panel is known as an 
Inspector, so clicking Properties actually displays two inspectors: Properties 
and Timing.
from the top right of the Captivate window, click Library
The Library Inspector, which keeps tabs of many of a project’s assets, takes 
the place of the Properties Inspector. You’ll learn to use the Library beginning 
on page 90.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
3. Explore the Timeline.
from the bottom center of the Captivate window, click Timeline
The Timeline appears at the bottom of the Captivate window. You’ll learn how 
to work with the Timeline beginning on page 76.
With the Timeline and Library open, your screen is a bit more... complicated. 
Although all of these open inspectors are useful, it’s a good idea to know how 
to get yourself back to the nice, clean interface you saw a few moments ago. 
Next you’ll learn how to reset the workspace.
4. Reset the workspace.
choose Window > Workspace > Reset ‘Classic’
You can Reset your workspace at any time and as often as you like. If you 
ever feel that the Captivate interface is getting out of control, you can reset 
the workspace at any time.

Previewing
You will learn how to create a series of eLearning lessons using Captivate. At some 
point, you will finish the development process by publishing (you will learn how to 
Publish beginning on page 225). Once published, the eLearning lesson can be used 
(consumed) by people using all kinds of devices (including desktop computers and 
mobile devices, such as the iPad or the Kindle Fire). Prior to publishing, it’s a good 
idea to preview the project so you can see how the lesson looks once published. 
There are multiple preview options, including Play Slide, Project, From this Slide, 
Next 5 slides, In Browser, HTML5 in Browser, and In Adobe Edge Inspect. Because 
previewing the Project shows a quick version of a published project without starting a 
web browser and Next 5 slides quickly shows just a few slides at a time, I find those 
two options to be the most useful.
Student Activity: Preview the Entire Project
1. Ensure that the AceInterview project is still open.
2. Preview the project.
from the Toolbar at the top of the Captivate window, click Preview
choose Project from the menu
The lesson is generated and then begins to play. After several seconds, the 
fourth slide stops and waits for you to interact with it.

Previewing Confidence Check
1. Continue working through the preview. 
2. When you are finished interacting with the lesson (you do 
not need to watch it in its entirety), click the End button 
on the toolbar at the top of the preview.
3. Preview the project In Browser.
A preview of the lesson (as it will appear via a web browser) opens in your 
default web browser. 
4. Again, there is no need to go through the entire lesson. You can close the 
browser window when you are done exploring.
5. Close the project (there is no need to save if prompted).
Note: You might have noticed that you cannot drag the Inspectors 
around your screen like you can in other programs. Because there are 
so many Inspectors in Captivate, it’s generally a good idea to leave the 
Captivate interface alone. However, if you have multiple monitors, you 
might want to put a few Inspectors on one monitor and your main 
Captivate window on another monitor. If you’d like to move your 
Inspectors around the screen, you can create custom workspaces. 
Open Captivate’s Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit > 
Preferences (if you’re a Windows user) or Adobe Captivate > 
Preferences (if you’re a Mac user). Then select Enable custom 
workspaces/panel undocking.
Click the OK button to close the dialog box and then restart Captivate. 
You’ll then be able to move several of the panels around your screen 
(even across multiple screens). If you like your new workspace, you 
can keep it by choosing Window > Workspace > Save Workspace. 
Once saved, your new workspace is available in the Workspace sub-
menu.
While custom workspaces are great, they can result in a cluttered 
Captivate environment. For that reason, I’ll avoid them completely in 
this book. I’d encourage you to work through this book using the 
Classic workspace and create custom workspaces once you feel more 
comfortable with Adobe Captivate.

Soft Skills eLearning
You can use Adobe Captivate to record actions you perform on your computer. Those 
recordings can be interactive (often referred to as “Let Me Try” eLearning), demos 
(often referred to as “Show Me” eLearning), and videos (much like the kind you’ve 
likely seen on YouTube or Vimeo). 
Soft Skills eLearning encompasses anything that doesn’t fall into the category of a 
computer recording. Over the years, I’ve helped my clients develop soft skills lessons 
covering all kinds of topics, including onboarding, terrorism awareness, compliance 
training, conflict resolution, and policies and procedures. Anything that’s a life skill 
would fall into the category of soft skills.
During the lessons in this module, you will create a soft skills lesson that introduces 
employees of an imaginary company called Super Simplistic Solutions. The managers 
you will add to the lesson don’t exist either. Made-up content or not, the project you 
are about to create will include multiple slides, text captions, and images. You will 
add interactive buttons to the slides, allowing the learner to move through the lesson 
at their own pace. 
Student Activity: Create a Blank Project
1. Create a blank project. 
using Adobe Captivate, choose File > New Project > Blank Project
The New Blank Project dialog box opens.

4. Apply a theme.
from the left side of the Toolbar, click Themes 
A theme is a collection of master slides, placeholders, and object styles that 
allow you to keep your slides looking consistent throughout a project. By 
applying a theme, each new slide you add during the next steps is formatted 
using the attributes of that theme.
roll your cursor over the themes to display their names and select the one 
called Clear
Note: If you don’t see the Clear theme, click the Browse link in the 
lower left of the Themes area and find the themes collection on your 
computer. Windows users, browse to eLearning 
Assets\Layouts\9_0\en_US\. Mac users, browse to 
Documents\My Adobe Captivate Projects\Layouts\ 
9_0\en_US\.
You will be prompted to confirm the action.
click the Yes button
The existing slide takes on the appearance of the theme.

1. Select slide 3 and insert a new slide based on 
Content 04.
2. Replace the placeholders as necessary to make the new 
slide look like the image below. (The image used in the 
image placeholder is betty_baby.)
3. Preview the project In Browser. (You learned how to Preview on page 21.)
The lesson automatically moves from slide to slide. When the lesson is 
finished, you can use the playbar at the bottom of the window to rewind the 
lesson.
If this is the first eLearning lesson you’ve ever created, congratulations are in 
order. Although this lesson isn’t very complex, it is an eLearning lesson. Take a 
bow... you’re on your way!
In the next section, you’ll learn how to add a button to the slides that will add 
interactivity for the learners and allow them to control when it’s time to move 
from one slide to the next.
4. When finished previewing, close the browser window.
5. Spend a few moments applying a few of the other Themes to your project and 
take note of how the Theme designs impact your current slide layouts.
6. When finished, save and close the project.

Buttons
Buttons provide learner interactivity to a slide. Using Actions, you can control what 
happens when the learner successfully clicks a button (such as Go to the next slide 
or Play Audio). There are multiple types of buttons: Text, Transparent, Image, and 
Shapes. During the following activities, you’ll insert and format Text buttons. 
Student Activity: Insert and Format a Text Button
1. Using Captivate, open ButtonMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
With the exception of the Theme and some of the wording on the slides, this is 
the same project you created earlier.
2. Insert a Text button.
ensure that you are on slide 1
from the toolbar, click Interactions and choose Button
The new button appears in the middle of the slide. The appearance of the 
button is based on the fonts and colors used by the selected theme. (This 
project uses the Blackboard theme.)
3. Drag the button until its position is similar to the picture below.

33
Note: The image above was taken from the Macintosh version of 
Captivate. If you’re using Windows, the font shown on your button 
looks different than what is shown. No worries. The font used by the 
button is not important at this point. You’ll learn to use Object Styles to 
control fonts later. 
4. Change the text displayed on the button.
double-click the button to display the Properties Inspector
Approximately one-third down the Properties Inspector, notice that there are 
three tabs: Style, Actions, and Options.
on the Style tab, replace the existing Caption text with Continue
5. Review the button’s Action.
with the button still selected, select the Actions tab on the Properties 
Inspector
An Action occurs after the learner has performed a desired step. In this 
instance, when the learner successfully clicks the button on slide 1, you want 
the learner to be taken to the next slide. Therefore, the On Success action of 
Go to the next slide is perfect.

6. Add a Hand Cursor to the button.
ensure that the button is still selected
on the Actions tab, Others area, select Hand Cursor
A Hand Cursor lets the learner know that the button is clickable by changing 
the appearance of the mouse cursor to a hand icon when the learner runs the 
mouse over the button.
7. Save your work.
8. Preview the Project.
on the Toolbar, click Preview and choose Project
As the first slide plays, notice that the button prevents the slide from moving 
forward on its own.
click the button to move to the second slide
Did you notice that there was a click sound that accompanied the button? 
Some people like the click sound, others do not. Assuming you do not like the 
click sound, you will learn how to remove it.
9. Close the preview.

Student Activity: Disable Click Sounds
1. Ensure that the ButtonMe project is still open.
2. Disable a button’s Click Sound.
ensure that you are on slide 1
double-click the Button
from the Actions tab, Others area of the Properties Inspector, select 
Disable Click Sound
3. Preview the Project.
on the Toolbar, click Preview and choose Project

Buttons Confidence Check
1. Still working in the ButtonMe project, copy the button you 
added to slide 1 to the clipboard.
2. On the Filmstrip, select slide 2.
3. Press the [shift] key on your keyboard, click the last 
slide on the Filmstrip, and then release the [shift] key.
All of the slides except slide 1 should now be selected.
4. Paste the button onto the selected slides.
The cool thing about copying and pasting slide objects is that, in addition to 
getting the object on several slides at once, the pasted objects are all in the 
same slide location.
5. Go to slide 3.
6. The Continue button is very close to the picture of Biff. You could leave it 
where it is. However, if you’d like to move it to the other side of the slide, try 
this technique: select the button and, with the [shift] key down, press the 
[left arrow key] on your keyboard several times to move the button left. You 
can position the button anywhere on the left side of the slide.
Note: Holding the [shift] key down while you press the arrow key 
moves the object faster than pressing the arrow key repeatedly.
7. Go to slide 5 and select the Continue button.
8. Change the button’s caption to Replay. (You learned how to change a 
button’s caption on page 33.)

9. Change the On Success Action for the button to Jump to slide.
10. Select 1 Slide 1 as the destination. (You learned about Actions on page 33.)
11. Preview the project.
There should be interactive buttons on each slide allowing you to control how 
fast or slow you move through the lesson. When you get to the last slide, click 
the Replay button to get to the first slide.
12. Close the preview.
13. Save and close the project.

Preparing to Record
Standard Captivate projects consist of individual slides, similar to Microsoft 
PowerPoint. You can create a blank Captivate project and insert slides, just like you 
learned to do beginning on page 24. If you need to capture a software application, 
you can use any one of several programs. For instance, I used SnagIt for the 
Macintosh (www.snagit.com) and FullShot (www.fullshot.com) for Windows to 
create the Captivate screen captures in this book. Individual screen captures can be 
inserted onto any Captivate slide as an image.
As an alternative to using a third-party application to create screen captures, you can 
use Captivate to record just about anything you do on your computer. Captivate 
offers three recording types: Automatic, Manual, and Video. If you use Captivate’s 
Automatic recording type, Captivate captures the steps you take on your computer 
by creating a screen capture every time you click your mouse. There are four 
Automatic capture modes: Demonstration, Assessment Simulation, Training 
Simulation, and Custom. Each mode is covered during this module.
If you create projects using the Manual recording type, you are responsible for 
pressing a specific key on your keyboard each time you want Captivate to create a 
screen capture (the default key is the Print Screen key in Windows). The problem 
with recording projects using the Manual Recording method is that you need to be 
very diligent about pressing the screen capture key on your keyboard. You could 
easily get distracted and forget to capture important screens, rendering your 
recording useless and requiring you to recapture some or all of your clicks.
Using the Video recording type, Captivate does not capture individual screens like the 
Automatic and Manual types. Instead, when the capture process is finished, you end 
up with a single video demonstrating everything you have done during the recording 
process. A video recording is ideal if you are trying to create an eLearning lesson 
demonstrating complex mouse actions (like those that would be required when 
drawing a shape in an image-editing application). However, editing a video is more 
limited as compared to editing individual screen captures typical in projects created 
using the Automatic or Manual recording types.
In the images below, both the Automatic and Manual recording types are shown at 
the left. Video mode is shown at the right. (Note: The Automatic and Manual modes 
are covered in this book. Video projects are covered in “Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond 
the Essentials.”)

Rehearsals
You have been hired to create an eLearning course that teaches new employees at 
your company how to use Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Macintosh). One of the 
lessons you plan to record using Captivate includes how to change the page 
orientation within Notepad or TextEdit. 
Here is a sample script showing the kind of detailed, step-by-step instructions you 
need to create or receive from a Subject Matter Expert (SME). You are expected to 
perform each step written below in either Notepad or TextEdit.
Dear Captivate developer, using either Notepad or TextEdit, 
record the process of changing the Page Orientation from 
Portrait to Landscape, and then back again (from Landscape to 
Portrait). Create the recording using a capture size of 800 x 
600. Thanks. Your pal, the Subject Matter Expert.
1. Click the File menu.
2. Click the Page Setup menu item.
3. Click the Landscape orientation button.
4. Click the OK button.
5. Click the File menu.
6. Click the Page Setup menu item.
7. Click the Portrait orientation button.
8. Click the OK button.
9. Stop the recording process.
The script sounds simple. However, you will not know what kind of trouble you are 
going to get into unless you rehearse the script prior to recording the process with 
Captivate. Let’s run a rehearsal, just as if you were a big-time movie director and you 
were in charge of a blockbuster movie.
Places everyone... and quiet on the set...

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
42
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Student Activity: Rehearse a Script
1. Minimize (hide) Captivate.
2. Start either Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).
The process of starting either Notepad or TextEdit varies slightly, depending 
on your operating system. For instance, if you are using Windows 7, choose 
Start, type notepad, and press [enter]. If you are using Windows 8 or 
newer, use the Search feature to start Notepad. If you are using a Mac, 
choose Go > Applications. Locate and then open TextEdit, and then create 
a New document.
In the images below, Notepad is pictured at the left; TextEdit is at the right.
3. Rehearse the script.
using either Notepad or TextEdit (not Captivate), click the File menu
click the Page Setup menu item
from the Orientation area, click Landscape
Note: In Notepad, Landscape is listed as the word “Landscape.” 
In TextEdit, Landscape is the second tool (shown below).
click the OK button
click the File menu
click the Page Setup menu item
click the Portrait orientation button
click the OK button
Hey, look at that! The script worked perfectly... no surprises. You are now 
ready to work the exact steps again. Only this time, you will record every click 
that you make. During the recording process, Captivate creates one screen 
capture each time that you click your mouse.

Module 3: Recording Screen Actions > Preparing to Record > Review Recording Settings
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
43
Student Activity: Review Recording Settings
1. Show Captivate’s Preferences and set the Language and Audio Options.
minimize or hide Notepad/TextEdit and return to Captivate (no Captivate 
projects should be open)
if you are using Windows, choose Edit > Preferences; if you are using a 
Mac, choose Adobe Captivate > Preferences
The Preferences dialog box opens. There are three main categories at the left: 
General Settings, Defaults, and Recording.
select the Recording category
from the Generate Captions In drop-down menu, ensure that English is 
selected 
There are several languages available in the menu, including German, Italian, 
and Japanese. The language you select controls the text that appears in the 
Text Captions that are automatically created during the recording process.
from the Audio Options area, deselect Narration, System Audio, Actions 
in Real Time, and Keystrokes
from the Audio Options area, leave Camera Sounds selected
The Narration option allows you to record a narrator at the same time that 
you record the lesson. Because you will not be using audio for the lesson you 
just rehearsed, you won’t need this option. However, this feature could prove 
useful if you are relying on an SME to both record the lesson and provide the 
narration. Instead of creating the lesson and the narration on different days, 
both can be created at the same time. Nevertheless, I typically work with 
professional audio talent and import audio files into my Captivate projects 
later during production (you will work with audio on page 140). System 
Audio allows you to record any sounds made by your computer, such as audio 
associated with a video you are recording or the sound you hear when error 
messages appear in some applications. 
If you select Actions in Real Time, Captivate sets the slide timing for 
your project slides to match the time it took you to complete a process. If you 
wait 10 seconds from one click to the next, Captivate sets your slide timing to 
match. I typically do not use this feature. With Camera Sounds selected, you 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
44
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
hear a sound effect much like a camera shutter every time Captivate creates a 
screen capture. If you leave Keystrokes selected, Captivate creates an 
animation within your project that shows what you type, as you’re typing—
typos and all. I typically do not use this feature. Instead, I allow users to type 
text directly into my Captivate simulations using Text Entry Boxes. You will 
learn about Text Entry Boxes on page 183.
2. Set the Hide options.
Windows users: from the Hide area, deselect Recording Window, Task 
Icon, and System Tray Icon (if necessary); Mac users, deselect 
Recording Window and Dock Icon (if necessary)
If you had selected Recording Window, Task Icon (Dock Icon), and 
System Tray Icon, you would hide all evidence of Captivate during the 
capture process. These items could get in the way if you were capturing your 
desktop and the Captivate application icon was on the screen. Because I tend 
to create software simulations within specific application windows, I typically 
leave these options deselected.
3. Ensure that new windows always appear in the Recording Area.
from the Others area, ensure Move New Windows Inside 
Recording Area is selected
The Move New Windows Inside Recording Area option could prove useful 
if a window tries to appear outside of the Recording Area. Captivate moves the 
window into the Recording Area for you. Without this feature, you would have 
to pause the movie, drag the window into the Recording Area, and continue. I 
typically enable this feature. 
4. Enable Video recording.
from the Smoothen movements for area, ensure both Drag and Drop 
actions and Mouse Wheel Actions are selected
These final two options deal with Video recordings, which you will learn about 
in “Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond the Essentials.”
In the images above, the Windows options are shown 
at the left; the Mac options, at the right.

45
5. Customize a recording key.
from the Recording category at the left, select Keys - (Global)
click in the To Stop Recording field and press the [y] key on your 
keyboard
The letter [y] replaces the key that was in the field by default. 
If you were to move forward and record a lesson using Captivate, you would 
press [y] on your keyboard to end the recording process. You can customize 
the fields in this dialog box to suit your needs. For most people, the default 
keys work wonderfully.
6. Reset the default Recording Keys.
still in the Keys - (Global) area, click the Restore Defaults button
Mac users: On my Mac, the default To Stop Recording shortcut keys [Cmd] 
[Enter] never works. I changed the keyboard shortcut to [control] [e] and 
things work perfectly every time. 
click the OK button
When clicking the OK button, you might see the alert dialog box below.
Project Cache is listed among the General Settings Preferences. Much like 
temporary Internet files created by web browsers as you surf the web, the 
Project Cache folder stores components of all of your projects until you click 
the Clear Cache button. The cached projects make the process of re-opening, 
saving, and working on projects faster than previous versions of Captivate. 
However, the Cache folder cannot be located on a remote location, such as a 
network or external drive. To resolve the issue presented in the dialog box 
above, select General Settings from the Preferences category list at the 
left. From the Project Cache area, click the Browse button. Open your Local 
Disk and either select a folder on the disk or create a new one. (I typically 
create a new folder called CpCache directly on the hard drive, but you can use 
any folder on the local disk). Once you’ve specified a local location for the 
cache, you should be able to click the OK button to close the Preferences 
dialog box.

Multimode Recordings
As first mentioned on page 40, there are multiple Automatic recording modes: 
Demonstration, Assessment Simulation, Training Simulation, and Custom. Each 
mode is covered during this module.
Demonstration mode is ideal if you want to show a quick software concept to 
someone, but you don’t expect the person to follow along and actually perform the 
steps being demonstrated. When recording using Demonstration mode, Captivate 
automatically includes Text Captions (text bubbles that tell users what’s happening 
on the screen), Highlight Boxes (colorful boxes), and a simulated mouse cursor that 
work together to grab the learner’s attention.
Assessment simulations allow you to record and create interactive eLearning at one 
time. An Assessment includes Click Boxes (to make the lesson interactive) and 
Failure Captions (to help the user who clicks in the wrong place or performs the 
wrong step) by default. However, because an Assessment Simulation won’t include 
Text Captions, an Assessment Simulation works best when teamed with a 
Demonstration. You’ve likely experienced this kind of eLearning: there’s a “show me” 
lesson that demonstrates a concept; then there’s an interactive “let me try” version 
of the same lesson that is interactive.
Training simulations are similar to Assessments. However, in addition to Click Boxes 
and Failure Captions being automatically added, you will also gain Hint Captions 
(captions that appear if the learner moves their mouse close to the Click Box but 
does not actually click anywhere).
Custom recordings can be set up to be a combination of the Demonstration, 
Assessment, and Training modes.
During the activities that follow, you will review Captivate’s default preferences for 
recording Demonstrations, Assessment simulations, and Training simulations. Then 
you will use all three modes—at the same time—to record the process of changing 
the page orientation in Notepad or TextEdit (using the script you rehearsed on 
page 42).

Module 3: Recording Screen Actions > Multimode Recordings > Review Recording Modes
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
47
Student Activity: Review Recording Modes
1. Ensure that Captivate is still running (no projects should be open).
2. Display Captivate’s Preferences dialog box.
if you are using Windows, choose Edit > Preferences; if you are using a 
Mac, choose Adobe Captivate > Preferences
3. Review the default settings for Demonstration mode.
from the Recording categories at the left, select Modes
Notice that there is a Mode drop-down menu at the right.
from the Mode drop-down menu, choose Demonstration
from the bottom of the dialog box, click the Restore Defaults button
It’s possible that clicking the Restore Defaults button didn’t do anything to 
the settings you see on your screen. However, clicking the button has reset 
the options to Captivate’s original settings. Because I have no idea if you (or 
someone else) has changed the recording settings, it’s a good idea to restore 
the defaults. At this point, the settings are back to what you would see after 
starting Captivate for the first time. After you have completed the lessons in 
this module, you can modify the recording settings.
review the Captions area
In the Captions area, notice that Add Text Captions is selected by default. 
Convert Tooltips to Rollover Captions and Use Smart Shapes instead of 
Captions are both deselected. You will learn how to insert and work with Text 
Captions beginning on page 66. However, during the recording process, 
Captivate adds a bunch of Text Captions to your slide for you, which is, quite 
frankly, awesome. (When you see the automatic Text Captions, I dare you not 
to smile!) You will learn how to work with Smart Shapes on page 102 and 
Rollover Captions on page 128. Once you have mastered those Captivate

features, you can come back to this dialog box and experiment with what 
those two options do for your recording. For now, it’s best to leave both 
options deselected.
review the Mouse area
In the Mouse area, notice that Show Mouse Location and Movement and 
Add Highlight Boxes on Click are both selected by default. By including the 
Mouse Location, learners see a mouse move around the screen as they watch 
your demonstration. The mouse they see is actually mimicking where you 
pointed and clicked during the recording process. And by adding Highlight 
Boxes, learners see a colorful box that leads the eye to the area of the screen 
where the action is occurring. You will learn how to modify several aspects of 
the mouse pointer beginning on page 114; you will learn how to work with 
Highlight Boxes on page 119.
review the Click Boxes area
In the Click Boxes area, notice that none of the options are selected... nor 
can you select them. Click Boxes add interactivity to your eLearning lessons. 
They’re great, but because demonstrations are not interactive, you don’t need 
Click Boxes. The other modes (which you will review next) rely heavily on Click 
Boxes. (You will learn how to add Click Boxes to a project manually beginning 
on page 179.)
review the Text Entry Boxes area

Module 3: Recording Screen Actions > Multimode Recordings > Review Recording Modes

As with Click Boxes, Text Entry Boxes are deselected by default. Text Entry 
Boxes are also interactive and allow learners to type directly within a 
simulation. (You will learn how to add Text Entry Boxes to a project beginning 
on page 183.)
4. Review the default settings for Assessment Simulation mode.
from the Mode drop-down menu, choose Assessment Simulation
from the bottom of the dialog box, click the Restore Defaults button
review the Captions area
Because learners who take this lesson are expected to prove that they 
understand the demonstration they likely watched before opening the 
assessment, there isn’t a need to include text captions. For that reason, the 
captions are disabled by default.
review the Mouse area
Because this lesson is interactive, allowing Captivate to create an artificial 
mouse would be confusing to the learner. Both the Mouse and Highlight Box 
options are disabled by default.
review the Click Boxes and Text Entry Boxes areas
An Assessment Simulation is expected to be interactive. Both Click Boxes and 
Text Entry Boxes are selected by default. In addition, Failure Caption is 
enabled. If the learner clicks in the wrong place while moving through the 
lesson, the learner sees a correction via the Failure Caption.

5. Review the default settings for Training Simulation mode.
from the Mode drop-down menu, choose Training Simulation
from the bottom of the dialog box, click the Restore Defaults button
review the Captions and Mouse areas
As with the Assessment Simulation, there is no need for captions, the mouse, 
or Highlight Boxes.
review the Click Boxes and Text Entry Boxes areas
As with the Assessment Simulation, a lesson created using this mode is 
expected to be interactive. Both Click Boxes and Text Entry Boxes are selected 
by default (along with Failure Captions). Notice that Hint Caption is also 
selected. If the learner gets close to the location of the Click Box, the learner 
gets a hint about how to proceed. Hint Captions are great if your learner 
doesn’t have strong mouse skills, tends to point at screen objects, but doesn’t 
naturally click the mouse.
6. Close the Preferences dialog box by clicking the OK button.
Note to Mac Users: You’re about to record screen actions. However, if you 
are using two monitors, it’s possible that you won’t see the red Captivate 
Recording Area shown on the next page. I’ve been able to get the recording 
area to appear by choosing Apple > System Preferences > Displays > 
Arrangement and selecting Mirror Displays. Although you won’t be able to 
take advantage of having two monitors while recording screen actions using 
Captivate, you can turn off Mirror Displays once the recording process is 
complete.

1. Ensure that Captivate is running (no projects should be open). 
2. Ensure that Notepad or TextEdit is running (see page 42). 
3. Display the Recording Area and control panel.
from within Captivate, click the New tab on the Home screen
double-click Software Simulation (or choose File > Record new 
Software Simulation)
Notice that there is a red box. Known as the Recording Area, this is the area of 
the screen that will be captured during the recording process. There is also a 
control panel containing Size and Recording Type controls.

4. Specify what Captivate is supposed to record.
WINDOWS USERS:
from the top of the control panel, select Application
from the Select the window to record drop-down menu that appears, 
select Untitled - Notepad
On your screen, notice that the red Recording Area and Notepad occupy the 
same space. By specifying Notepad as the Application, Captivate’s Recording 
Area is now focusing on Notepad
from the Snap to area, select Custom Size
select 800 x 600 from the drop-down menu
The Recording Area resizes to 800 x 600. And because you selected 
Application, the Notepad application also resizes to 800 x 600.
The next few steps are for Mac users only. Windows users, skip to step 5 
below. (Look for the text ALL USERS.)
MAC USERS:
The menu bar in your applications stays locked at the top of the screen (the 
menu does not float in the application’s window like Windows applications). 
You won’t typically use the Application or Snap To selections unless the 
process you are recording does not include the menu bar. During the following 
recording process, you will be including the menu bar as you change the Page 
Orientation within TextEdit. You need to manually specify a Screen Area for 
Captivate to record.
from the top of the control panel, select Screen Area
ensure the Set Capture Area to is set to Custom Size
select 800 x 600 from the drop-down menu

53
drag and resize the TextEdit window and red Recording Area as 
necessary until your screen looks similar to the image below (notice that 
the TextEdit menu bar is within the Recording Area)
ALL USERS:
When recording, you should use the smallest Recording Size that works for 
you and the application or Screen Area that you are recording. Keep in mind 
that the smaller your Recording Area, the fewer megabytes your published 
video will be. The fewer the megabytes, the faster your learners can download 
and consume your eLearning content.
5. Select a Recording Mode.
from the Recording Type area of the Control panel, select Automatic
With this option selected, every click of your mouse during the recording 
process creates a screen capture. In contrast, had you selected Manual 
mode, you would need to press a key on your keyboard (typically the [print 
screen] key for Windows users, [command] [F6] for Mac users) to capture 
the screen.
select Demo, Assessment, and Training from the list of modes

6. Disable Panning and Audio Narration.
ensure that Panning is set to No Panning and that Audio is set to 
No Narration
if necessary, deselect System Audio
You’ll learn about Panning later (page 220). Although audio is a good thing in 
your eLearning, in my experience, it is best to create the audio later (during 
production). You will learn to work with audio beginning on page 139.
7. Record multiple modes.
click the Record button 
You see a 3-second countdown and then nothing.
While nothing seems to have happened, Captivate is waiting patiently for you 
to follow your script, and click within either Notepad or TextEdit.
using your mouse, click the File menu within Notepad or TextEdit
click the Page Setup menu item
from the Orientation area, click Landscape
click the OK button
click the File menu
click the Page Setup menu item
click the Portrait orientation button and then click the OK button
8. Stop the recording. 
Windows users, press [end] on your keyboard; Mac users, press 
[control] [e] (or whatever stop recording shortcut you set up) on your 
keyboard
Once you stop the recording process, slides are created and three unsaved 
projects open in Captivate.
Note: If you can’t get Captivate to stop recording via your keyboard 
shortcut, you can manually stop the recording process by clicking the 
Captivate icon in the System Tray (Windows users) or the Dock (Mac 
users).

9. Preview the demo.
near the top of the Captivate window, notice that there are three tabs, one 
untitled project for each mode you selected prior to recording
select the first tab (untitled_demo1)
from the toolbar, click Preview and choose Project
As the preview plays, notice that the project contains text captions and 
Highlight Boxes. You will learn how to create captions from scratch as you 
move through the lessons in this book. If this is your first time automatically 
recording an eLearning project, there is a good chance you have just been 
blown away with the fact that Captivate added reasonable, usable text to your 
new lesson out of the box. Very cool!
Note to Mac users: If you didn’t get any text captions during the recording 
process or you received an error message while trying to record, try this. Click 
the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. Select Security & 
Privacy. Select Accessibility and then, from the Allow the apps below to 
control your computer area, select Adobe Captivate.app. Close the 
window and then try recording again.
10. When the preview is finished, close the preview by pressing the [Esc] key on 
your keyboard.
11. Close the demo project (there is no need to save it).
Two projects should still be open: untitled_assessment and 
untitled_training.
Preview Confidence Check
1. Preview the untitled_assessment project. As you do, 
notice that using this mode has created an interactive 
simulation. You can click where you were supposed to 
click to move to the next slide and continue the lesson. 
Click anywhere else on the screen to see a Failure 
Caption.
2. When finished with the untitled_assessment project, 
close it without saving it.
3. Preview the untitled_training project. As you do, notice 
that using this lesson is nearly identical to the assessment lesson you just 
closed. However, when you move your mouse close to the area of the screen 
where you are supposed to click, you see the Hint Captions.
You’ve got to admit that this is awesome stuff... three modes, three projects... 
and all it took you was a few clicks here and there.
4. When finished with the untitled_training project, close it without saving it.

Custom Recordings
You have now learned how to record three kinds of eLearning lessons with Adobe 
Captivate: Demonstrations, Assessment Simulations, and Training Simulations. 
Between demonstrations and simulations, which type of lesson results is the most 
effective learning experience for your users? There is no clear-cut answer.
Demonstrations are relatively quick and easy to create (you just did). However, 
demonstrations do not allow for learner interaction. When learners watch a 
demonstration rather than participate in an interactive simulation, the potential for 
learning is reduced. The Text Captions that are automatically created by Captivate 
are great, but they are written in the imperative, or command, form. For instance, a 
typical Text Caption created by Captivate is likely to say something like “Select the 
File Menu.” Upon reading that instruction, a learner is likely to take the caption’s 
instructions literally and attempt to select the File menu. Unfortunately, at the same 
time that the learner is trying to interact with the demonstration, a mouse pointer 
that Captivate created when the lesson was recorded is likely moving around the 
screen. In this case, you’re going to end up with one confused and possibly frustrated 
learner. 
Simulations are perfect for assessing what a learner has absorbed during a 
demonstration. However, because Simulations do not add any Text Captions by 
default, there are no instructions telling learners what to do. Learners either perform 
the required steps or click incorrectly somewhere on the screen and see a Failure 
Caption. Some people consider this kind of approach to eLearning to be a bit harsh 
because the learner is often experiencing negative feedback with no guidance.
Many Captivate developers create both a Demonstration and a Simulation. That’s all 
well and good until you remember that it could take several hours to produce the 
lessons. If you elect to produce both a Demonstration and an Assessment, you are 
essentially making twice the work for yourself.
Demonstration or Simulation: Which Mode is Best?
Instead of creating a Demonstration and a Simulation, I recommend you record a 
custom, or hybrid, lesson that incorporates the best of the Demonstration, 
Assessment, and Training modes.
When you are finished recording the custom lesson, the result is a lesson that bridges 
the gap between a Demonstration and an Assessment/Simulation lesson.

Module 3: Recording Screen Actions > Custom Recordings > Record a Custom Simulation

57
Student Activity: Record a Custom Simulation
1. Set the Preferences for the simulation you are about to record.
Windows users, choose Edit > Preferences; 
Mac users, choose Adobe Captivate > Preferences
from the Recording category, select Modes
from the Mode drop-down menu, select Custom
click the Restore Defaults button at the bottom of the dialog box
from the Captions area, select Add Text Captions
from the Click Boxes area, select Add Click Boxes on Mouse Click and 
Failure Caption
By now you should be somewhat comfortable with the available options in this 
dialog box. You have selected Add Text Captions so that the Text Captions 
are created for you (like you saw with a Demonstration). Nice. And because 
the captions are written in the imperative, you may be able to use them in the 
new lesson with little editing. Nicer. Everything else has been left deselected 
except for Click Boxes and Failure Caption (like the simulation modes). 
These two settings result in a highly interactive simulation out of the box. 
Nicest!
click the OK button

2. Record the custom simulation.
from within Captivate, click the New tab on the Home screen
double-click Software Simulation (or choose File > Record new 
Software Simulation)
Captivate once again hides, and the recording options appear. Notice that the 
settings you specified last were remembered so you don’t have to set the 
Screen Area options again (if you closed Notepad or TextEdit, you can review 
the Screen Area settings on page 51).
3. Record the Custom simulation.
from the Recording Type area, select Custom
deselect the other modes

4. Stop the recording process.
5. Preview the project.
As you move through the lesson, notice that the Text Captions are written in 
the imperative to encourage interactivity. There may be one or two captions 
you need to edit (some of the buttons are likely mislabeled, especially on the 
Mac side). Nevertheless, much of the caption-writing work is done. 
Also notice that there are Click Boxes (hot spots) that make this lesson 100 
percent interactive.
6. When finished previewing the lesson, close the preview.
7. Close the project (there is no need to save it).

Recording Confidence Check
Record a lesson using caption written in a language other than 
English:
1. Display the Preferences dialog box (Edit menu for 
Windows users; Adobe Captivate menu for Mac users).
2. From the categories at the left, select Recording.
3. From the Generate Captions In drop-down menu, 
choose any language. 
Note: If you do not have the Asian fonts installed on your computer, you 
might want to select a language other than the Asian languages. Without the 
Asian fonts, you’ll see white boxes instead of letters in the resulting Text 
Captions.
4. Create another Software Simulation with Notepad or TextEdit that uses the 
Custom mode. (When you record the simulation, run through the same script 
you have used throughout this module).
5. Stop the recording process and preview the project.
Notice that the Text Captions are using the language you specified in the 
Generate Captions In drop-down menu.
6. Close the project (there is no need to save it when prompted).
7. Display the Preferences dialog box again and set the Recording language 
back to English.
8. Close Notepad/TextEdit (there is no need to save if prompted).

Panning
Captivate’s Panning feature is useful when you want to record something on your 
computer that is outside of the red Recording Area. If you enable Panning prior to 
recording and use Captivate’s Automatic mode, clicking outside of the Recording Area 
forces Captivate to move the Recording Area and includes the area you clicked. You 
can also use Manual Panning where you drag the Recording Area to the area of the 
screen you would like to record.
Student Activity: Record a Demonstration that Pans
1. Start a web browser and navigate to www.disney.com. 
2. Switch to Captivate and create a new Software Simulation.
3. Select a screen area to record instead of a specific application.
from the top of the control panel, select Screen Area
4. Specify a recording size.
from the Set Capture Area to area, select Custom Size
from the next drop-down menu, select 640 x 480
5. Drag the red recording box to the upper left of the browser window.
6. Resize the browser window so it’s about 30 percent larger than the red 
Recording Area.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
62
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Because you selected Screen Area instead of Application, the red Recording 
Area stays sized to 640 x 480 and does not get larger as you resize the 
browser window.
More important, there are menus on the Disney site that are not within the red 
recording area (the TV menu in the image above, for example). If you record 
now and click any of the menus outside of the recording area, none of those 
actions will be recorded. This is a perfect place to use the Panning feature.
7. Select a Recording Mode.
from the Recording Type area of the Control panel, ensure Automatic is 
selected
from the list of modes, select Demo and then deselect the other modes 
8. Enable Panning.
from the Panning drop-down menu, choose Manual Panning
9. Record the Demo.
click the Record button
when ready, click one or two of the menus on the Disney.com navigation 
bar (within the red Recording Area)
10. Manually pan.
carefully drag the right edge of the red Recording Area right so some of 
the menus at the right of the Disney site are within the Recording Area
click on one of the Disney website menus within the recording area
11. Stop the recording process.
12. Preview the project.
13. When finished previewing the project, close the preview.
14. Save the new project to the Captivate9Data folder as ExampleOfPanning.
15. Close the project.

Manual Recordings
If you’ve stepped through all of the activities in this module, you’ve now used every 
recording option in Captivate except two—Manual mode and Video mode (Video 
Mode is covered in Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond the Essentials). In most instances, 
recording screen actions using Captivate’s Automatic Recording type gets the job 
done for you. However, you will come across some applications where attempting to 
record automatically does not work (some applications won’t get along with 
Captivate and prove difficult to record). This is a perfect opportunity to use 
Captivate’s Manual recording type.
Note: If you are running a screen capture utility (such as SnagIt), 
disable or close it prior to trying to record manually with Captivate. If a 
competing screen capture application is running, that program will grab 
screen captures instead of Captivate.
Student Activity: Manually Record the Screen
1. Ensure that Captivate is still running (no projects should be open). 
2. Rehearse the lesson you are going to record.
return to the Disney website: www.disney.com
point, but don’t click on some of the links on the Disney site
You’d like to capture the process of pointing to site objects, but recording the 
action with Captivate is going to be difficult because it takes mouse clicks to 
create screen captures.
3. Display the recording control panel.
return to Captivate and create a new Software Simulation
4. Select the Disney site as the Application to record.
from the top of the control panel, select Application
from the Select window drop-down menu, choose the Disney site
from the Snap to area, select Custom Size
from the next drop-down menu, choose 640 x 480 (if necessary)

5. Select the Manual Recording Type.
from the Recording Type area of the Control panel, select Manual
change the Panning to No Panning
6. Record the Manual Demo.
click the Record button
Unlike the other modes, no screen capture is created for you. You’ll need to 
create every screen capture on your own.
Windows users, press [Print Screen] on your keyboard; 
Mac users, press [Command] [F6]
point to one of the links on the navigation bar
Windows users, press [Print Screen] on your keyboard; 
Mac users, press [Command] [F6]
point to another one of the links on the navigation bar
Windows users, press [Print Screen] on your keyboard; 
Mac users, press [Command] [F6]
Note: Mac users may find it tough, if not impossible, to use the 
function keys to create manual shots because those keys might activate 
special features (those special features are printed on each key). You 
can disable the special features by displaying the Mac’s System 
Preferences (via the Apple menu) and selecting Keyboard. On the 
Keyboard tab, select Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function 
keys. Alternatively, you can display the Keys - Global Preference 
within Captivate and change the Manual Recording Key.
7. Stop the recording.
8. Preview the project, and notice that the screens you captured appear. But this 
is a bare-bones recording. You would now need to move through the project 
and add required project assets that recording in the Automatic mode would 
normally have included (Text Captions, Highlight Boxes, etc.).
9. Close the project (there is no need to save it).

Text Captions
Text Captions are typically used to explain a concept being shown onscreen. You can 
have multiple text captions on the same slide, and you can control how the captions 
look (to a limited degree), where they appear on the slide, and when they appear 
(via the Timeline or the Properties Inspector). 
Student Activity: Insert and Edit Text Captions
1. Using Adobe Captivate, open the CaptionMe project from the 
Captivate9Data folder.
2. Reset the Classic workspace.
choose Window > Workspace > Reset Classic
By resetting the Classic workspace, any inspectors or toolbars that you might 
have opened during previous lessons in this book are put away, and your 
Captivate window should be clutter-free.
3. Preview the lesson.
choose Preview > Project
This project is a demonstration that was recorded using Captivate’s 
Demonstration mode (you learned how to create a software demonstration 
beginning on page 46). The lesson demonstrates the process of creating a 
new folder on an older version of Windows. It’s a perfectly fine demonstration, 
but there are no Text Captions telling the learner what’s about to happen or 
why. During the next several activities, you will learn how to add Text 
Captions to several slides. You will also learn how to control the appearance of 
the captions and when they appear on the slide.
4. Close the Preview.
5. Show Captivate’s Preferences.
Windows users, choose Edit > Preferences; Mac users, choose 
Adobe Captivate > Preferences 
6. Restore the timing and style defaults used for inserted objects.
from the top of the Category list at the left, select Defaults
from the Object Defaults area, click the Restore All button
By clicking the Restore All button, any objects you insert into your Captivate 
projects (such as Text Captions) use the default timing and appearance 
specified by Adobe when Captivate was first installed on your computer. You 
will learn how to change the timing and style used by objects as you move 
through lessons in this book.

7. Insert a Text Caption.
on the Filmstrip, select slide 1
on the toolbar, click Text and choose Text Caption
The new Text Caption appears in the middle of the slide.
replace the text in the caption with Watch as the File menu is selected
8. Deselect the caption.
click above or below the Text Caption
With the caption deselected, you cannot edit the text within the caption, nor 
can you change the appearance of the caption or its slide location.
9. Use the Properties Inspector to change the Caption type for a selected Text 
Caption.
on slide 1, select the Text Caption
at the far right of the Captivate window, click Properties

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Because you selected the text caption on the slide, the Properties Inspector is 
displaying the properties of the selected caption.
on the Properties Inspector, locate the Caption Type drop-down menu 
from the Caption Type drop-down menu, choose HaloGreen
10. Resize a Text Caption.
with the Text Caption still selected, position your mouse pointer on one of 
the Text Caption’s resizing handles (the squares)
drag the resizing handle until the size of the Text Caption looks good to you
Although the exact size of any Text Caption is always up to you, consider 
making your Text Captions narrow and tall as opposed to wide and short. 
Narrow and tall text captions are typically easier to read than wide and short 
captions.
Note: As you work with more of the Caption Types, you’ll discover that 
some captions can be made only so small, while other types have fewer 
limitations on size.
11. Reposition a Text Caption on a slide.
with the Text Caption still selected, drag the middle of the caption toward 
the top left side of the slide and position it so your slide looks similar to 
the picture below

Module 4: Captions, Styles, and Timing > Text Captions > Modify Text Caption Properties
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
69
Student Activity: Modify Text Caption Properties
1. Ensure that the CaptionMe project is still open.
2. Change the Caption type.
on slide 1, select the Text Caption (if necessary)
on the Properties Inspector, locate the Caption Type drop-down menu 
from the Caption Type drop-down menu, choose Adobe Red
Hey! Did the size of that pesky Text Caption change when you changed the 
Caption type? There’s a very good chance that it did. Why? Captivate’s 
Autosize Captions feature is enabled by default. Although the feature might 
seem like a good thing, I’ve found that it often forces me to do extra work 
because Text Captions that I’ve already resized magically resize when I 
change the way they look (like you just did) or when I edit the text.
3. Disable the Autosize Captions option.
Windows users, choose Edit > Preferences; Mac users, choose 
Adobe Captivate > Preferences
from the top of the Category list at the left, select Defaults
from the General area at the bottom of the dialog box, deselect 
Autosize Captions
click the OK button
There won’t be any visible change to the Text Caption on your slide. You’ll see 
the results of disabling Autosize Captions next.
4. Resize the Text Caption again... this time, make it significantly larger.
5. Use the Properties Inspector to change the Caption Type to Frosted. 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
70
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Although the general appearance of the Text Caption certainly changes, there 
are no changes to the size of the Text Caption. Is that a good thing or a bad 
thing? I guess it depends on your perspective. Certainly, if you want Captivate 
to resize your Text Captions moving forward, turn the Autosize Captions 
option back on. I always leave the option deselected.
6. Change the character formatting for the caption text.
ensure the Text Caption on slide 1 is still selected
on the Properties Inspector, locate the Character area
change the font to Verdana
Note: When selecting Verdana, you won’t find it if you scroll too deep 
down the Font menu. Instead, you’ll find it higher in the menu (grouped 
among the Web Safe fonts). There are two groups of fonts in Captivate: 
Web Safe and System. I’d suggest that you always stick with Web 
Safe fonts. While there are just a few Web Safe fonts from which to 
choose, most computers (Mac and Windows) have the Web Safe Fonts 
installed. If you select Web Safe fonts, there’s a better chance that you 
won’t run into missing font issues when learners access your eLearning 
content. 
change the size to 15 pt 
7. Change the appearance of a single word.
double-click inside the text caption
Double-clicking a caption results in the insertion point appearing within the 
caption. At this point, you can edit the text within the caption and format 
selected words.
double-click the word File to highlight it
from the Character area on the Properties Inspector, select the Bold 
command
The Text Caption should look similar to the image below.

to Adobe Blue. (Need help? See page 69.)
3. Go to slide 3.
4. Insert a Text Caption with the words Watch as the New 
command is selected.
Notice that the formatting of the new Text Caption does 
not match the appearance of your first Text Caption. No worries... you’ll learn 
how to ensure consistent formatting of slide objects very soon. For now, 
you’re only concerned with knowing how to insert a Text Caption, not 
necessarily making it look good.
5. Go to slide 4 and insert a new Text Caption that says Watch as the Folder 
command is selected.
6. Go to slide 6 and insert a new Text Caption that says Watch as the new 
Folder is selected
7. Save and then close the project.

Caption Styles
During the activity that began on page 66, you learned how to insert a Text Caption 
and then how to change its formatting. Did you notice that every time you inserted a 
Text Caption, the appearance of the caption reverted to a specific Caption type, font, 
and font size? Although it is easy enough to change the appearance of the caption, 
you will quickly tire of the effort required to change every caption. Instead, you can 
alter the way Text Captions appear in this project via Caption Styles. Once you set up 
the appearance of the Caption Style, all new captions take on the attributes of the 
style and save you from extensive manual formatting.
Student Activity: Edit the Default Caption Style
1. Using Captivate, open StyleMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Go from slide to slide and notice that most of the slides in this project contain 
a Text Caption. The appearance of each Text Caption is identical (HaloBlue, 
Calibri, 16 pt).
3. Override a style.
go to slide 3 and select the Text Caption
using the Properties Inspector, change the Caption Type to HaloGreen
from the Character area, change the font to Verdana and the size to 15
The three changes you made to the caption have had an obvious effect on the 
selected Text Caption on slide 3. But what about the Text Captions on the 
other slides?
4. Explore the other slides.
go from slide to slide and notice that none of the other Text Captions have 
taken on the appearance of the Text Caption on slide 3
5. Observe an Object Style override.
return to slide 3 and select the Text Caption that you just formatted
at the top of the Properties Inspector, locate the Style Name area
A style named [Default Caption Style] is selected in the drop-down menu, 
indicating that it’s the style being used by the selected Text Caption. In fact, 
all of the Text Captions in the StyleMe project are using the Default Caption 

Module 4: Captions, Styles, and Timing > Caption Styles > Edit the Default Caption Style

73
Style, which explains the reason that the appearance of every Text Caption in 
the project is consistent.
Okay, okay, you caught me. I said above that every Text Caption in the 
project is using the [Default Caption Style]. I should have stated that most of 
the captions are following the [Default Caption Style]. In fact, the Text Caption 
on slide 3 is following only a portion of the formatting specified in the style. 
How can you tell? Take a look at the name of the style in the Style drop-down 
menu. There’s a plus sign to the left of the style’s name. 
The plus sign indicates that something about the way the caption has been 
formatted doesn’t match the intent of the style. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to tell exactly what the formatting issue is, but the plus sign is a handy way to 
quickly determine that the formatting is different in some way.
I’m betting that you don’t have a huge staff to support your eLearning 
development efforts. I’m also pretty sure that you don’t have hours to waste 
on manual labor. If you use the Properties Inspector to format every object on 
every slide, you’ll find yourself formatting and formatting and formatting. And 
when you’re done, you’ll format some more. I don’t want to even think about 
how much extra work you will have to deal with if you want (or your boss 
wants) to update the appearance of the captions throughout the project. For 
that reason, I discourage you from using the Properties Inspector to change 
the way any object looks. You’ll find it much more efficient to change the way 
things look via the Object Style Manager (you’ll play with that soon). Instead, 
use the Properties Inspector to change the way objects behave (Timing, 
Actions, etc.). Those kinds of properties are not controlled by an Object Style.
6. Reset a style.
with the Text Caption on slide 3 still selected, click the menu to the right of 
Style Name and choose Reset Style
The plus sign goes away, and the selected Text Caption is once again following 
the properties of the Default Caption Style (HaloBlue, Calibri, 16 pt).

7. Edit the Default Caption Style.
choose Edit > Object Style Manager
The Object Style Manager opens.
from the top of the Object Style Manager dialog box, select 
[Default Caption Style]
from the Caption area at the right, change the Caption Type to Frosted
from the Text Format area, change the Family to Verdana
change the Size to 15
click the OK button
Every caption in the project is now using the new Caption type and Text 
formatting. Don’t you love object styles? Make a few edits in one place (the 
Object Style Manager), and potentially hundreds of slide objects are updated 
instantly. Cool!
8. Save your work.

© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
75
Callouts
You learned how to apply a Caption type on page 69. While Caption types define the 
general look of the caption (HaloGreen, Adobe Blue, etc.), Callouts give a Text 
Caption direction. Most Caption Types include up to five Callouts that point to 
different areas of the slide. While Caption types are part of an Object Style 
(page 72), Callouts are options you manually apply to a selected object, one object 
at a time.
Student Activity: Change a Callout Used by a 
Text Caption
1. Ensure that the StyleMe project is still open.
2. Change the Callout used on a Text Caption.
go to slide 1
The Callout being used on the Text Caption is a simple rectangle.
select the Text Caption
on the Properties Inspector, select the third Callout
The caption now points up and to the left. The arrow helps guide the learner’s 
eye toward the area of the screen where the mouse action is occurring.
Confidence Check
1. Move the Text Caption up and to the left a bit until the 
position is similar to the image below.
2. Go through the remaining slides and apply the third Callout to the rest of the 
captions.
3. Position (drag) each of the captions on the slides where you think appropriate.
4. Save and close the project.

The Timeline
The Timeline is at the bottom of the Captivate window. Each slide has a unique 
Timeline. You can use the Timeline to control the timing of any slide object. For 
instance, using the Timeline, you can force the captions to appear on the slide at the 
same time, or you can force one caption to appear as another goes away. The 
Timeline consists of the following features: Object Bars, a Header, a Playhead, and 
Playback Controls. The objects on a project slide are displayed as stacked bars on the 
left side of the Timeline. The Header at the top of the Timeline indicates time in 
seconds (and parts of seconds). The Playhead shows the point in time in which the 
slide is being viewed. 
Student Activity: Control Slide and Object Timing
1. Using Captivate, open TimeMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Display the Timeline.
at the bottom of the Captivate window, click Timeline
3. Use the Timeline to extend the slide duration to eight seconds.
on the Timeline, position your mouse pointer on the far right edge of the 
Slide 1 object bar (until your mouse pointer looks like a double-headed 
arrow)
drag the right edge of the object to the right until you get to 00:08 
seconds on the Timeline (the word End should line up with the 00:08 mark 
on the Timeline)
4. Extend slide timing using the slide Properties.
click in the middle of slide 1 (be careful not to select the Text Caption)
open the Properties Inspector and, from the right, click Timing to open 
the Timing Inspector
change the Slide Duration to 10 sec

Module 4: Captions, Styles, and Timing > The Timeline > Control Slide and Object Timing

77
On the Timeline, notice that changing the Display Time on the Properties 
Inspector is exactly the same thing as dragging the right edge of the slide 
object to 10 seconds on the Timeline.
5. Use the Timeline to extend the display time for a Text Caption.
on the Timeline, select the object “Watch as the File menu is 
selected”
This object represents the Watch as the File menu is selected Text Caption 
on the slide.
on the Timeline, drag the right edge of the “Watch as the File menu is 
selected” object right until the object is stretched to 00:04 seconds 
6. Use the Timeline to change the timing for the mouse.
still working on slide 1, select the Mouse object on the Timeline
This object represents the mouse pointer on the slide.
drag the middle of the Mouse object right until its left edge lines up with 
00:04 on the Timeline

Confidence Check
1. Still working in the TimeMe project, change the Slide 
Duration for slide 1 to 5.7 seconds. 
(Need help? See page 76.)
2. Preview the first five slides. 
The Text Caption on slide 1 should play for four seconds. 
After the Text Caption disappears from the slide, the 
mouse pointer should move from the upper left of the 
slide to the slide’s File menu. Once the action on slide 1 
finishes, you’re off to slide 2.
While on slide 2, notice that it takes too much time for the click to actually 
occur—the timing needs work.
3. Close the preview and go to slide 2. On the Timeline, select the Mouse object 
and, using the Timing Inspector, change the Appear After to 0 sec.
4. From the Timing area, change the Display For Specific Time to 0.5 sec
5. On the Timeline, change the Slide Duration to 0.5 sec.
6. Starting with slide 1, preview the Next 5 Slides. When you get to slide 2, the 
timing of the mouse click should be better.
7. Change the timing for slides 3, 4, and 6 as follows:
Text Captions: Appear After 0 sec; Display For Specific Time: 4 sec
Mouse objects: Appear After 4 sec; Display For Specific Time: 1.7 sec
Slide Duration: 5.7 sec
8. Change the timing for slide 5 as follows:
Mouse object Appears After: 0 sec; Displays For Specific Time: 0.5 sec
Slide Duration: 0.5 sec (Note: If you have trouble using the Properties 
Inspector to change the Slide Duration to 0.5, use the Timeline.)
9. Preview the project. The timing between slides and objects should be smooth. 
When finished, close the preview, save, and close the project.

Module 4: Captions, Styles, and Timing > The Timeline > Check Spelling
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
79
Student Activity: Check Spelling
1. Open SpellMeAlignMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
This is pretty much the same project you’ve been working on since the 
beginning of this module. To save you a little work, I’ve added an introduction 
slide that explains the upcoming lesson. I timed the Text Captions so that 
each one plays for five seconds and appears on the slide one after the other.
2. Disable Calculate Caption Timing.
Windows users, choose Edit > Preferences; 
Mac user, choose Adobe Captivate > Preferences
from the top of the dialog box, select Defaults
from the General area, deselect Calculate Caption Timing
Depending on how you look at the world, the Calculate Caption Timing feature 
is one of those “glass half empty, half full” kind of commands. With the option 
selected, Captivate automatically calculates how long a caption stays on a 
slide based on the number of characters in the caption. That’s a glass half-full 
kind of thing—you don’t have to worry about the timing. 
However, if you select a specific display time (as you have done with the 
captions in this project) and then change a caption’s content, you would 
inadvertently reset your specified time to Captivate’s calculated caption 
timing. That’s a glass half-empty kind of thing—you’ll have to reset the timing 
via the Timeline or through the Text Caption’s properties. I always disable 
Calculate Caption Timing.
click the OK button
3. On slide 1, notice that there are typos in the Text Captions (from misspelled 
words to double words). No worries, you’ll be fixing each of the typos during 
the Check Spelling activity that follows.
4. Spell check the project.
choose Project > Check Spelling
The Check Spelling dialog box opens. The first word that is flagged as Not In 
Dictionary is the word foolders. It should be replaced with the word folders.

Student Activity: Align Slide Objects
1. Ensure that the SpellMeAlignMe project is still open.
2. Hide an object.
go to slide 1
There are four Text Captions on the slide. You’ll soon use Captivate’s 
alignment features to line up three of the four captions. One of the captions is 
in the way. Rather than drag it out of the way, only to have to drag it back, it 
is more efficient to temporarily hide it.
if necessary, display the Timeline (you learned how to display the Timeline 
on page 76)
on the left side of the Timeline, click the first circle just beneath the eyeball
The circle becomes a red x. The “During this demonstration” caption 
disappears from the slide (although it’s still visible on the Timeline).
With the top-most caption hidden, you can easily see the three remaining 
captions. Even though the caption is hidden from view, it will still preview and 
publish.
3. Select multiple captions.
click one time on the caption containing “New folders can be...”
press and hold the [shift] key on your keyboard
click one time on the caption containing “You can give your folder...”
keep the [shift] key down on your keyboard
click one time on the caption containing “Empty folders do not take...”
release the [shift] key
All three captions should be selected.
4. Left-align the selected captions.
choose Modify > Align > Align Left
The selected objects aligned to the left.
choose Modify > Align > Distribute Vertically
The captions are now lined up with the first caption you selected (objects with 
white handles serve as anchors, and other selected objects move to the 
anchors when you align objects). In addition, the vertical space between the 
selected captions is evenly spaced.

1. Ensure that the SpellMeAlignMe project is still open.
2. Ensure you are on slide 1, and choose Preview > Next 5 
slides.
3. As slide 1 plays, notice that the timing of the Text 
Captions is pretty good. But don’t you think it would be 
better if the three Text Captions (after the first one) 
stayed around for the duration of the slide? Sure you do!
4. Close the preview and return to slide 1. 
5. Select all three of the visible Text Captions on slide 1 (the first Text Caption 
should still be hidden).
6. Choose Modify > Show for the rest of the slide.
On the Timeline, notice that the selected objects have stretched to the end of 
the slide.
7. Preview the first five slides. 
Notice that after the first Text Caption goes away, the remaining captions show 
for the rest of the slide.
8. Show the hidden Caption.

Images
Captivate lets you import several graphic formats onto a slide including, but not 
limited to, native Photoshop documents (PSDs), BMPs (Windows Bitmap), GIFs 
(Graphics Interchange Format), JPG or JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group), 
ICOs (icons), WMFs (MetaFiles), EMFs (Enhanced MetaFiles), PNGs (Portable 
Network Graphics), and POTs (PowerPoint Templates). Once an image has been 
imported into a project, you can resize it, crop it, and apply multiple effects to it. 
You’ll also find that the image is represented in Captivate’s Library. Once there, a 
Library object can quickly be dragged to any slide.
Student Activity: Insert, Resize, and Restore an Image
1. Open Introduction from the Captivate9Data folder.
The Introduction project is a sample project provided by Next Turn 
Consulting, a training company specializing in improving communication, 
leadership, and results. It is the first of six modules in the CALM in Conflict© 
eLearning project. More information about Next Turn can be found at 
www.nextturnconsulting.com.
2. Preview the project.
The project is loaded with images, audio, captions, and object effects. During 
the immediate lessons, you will learn how to add and format some of the 
images you see in this project. You learned how to work with Text Captions 
beginning on page 66. You will learn about audio soon (page 139). And you 
will learn about object effects on page 170. 
3. Close the preview.
4. Close the project (do not save if prompted).
5. Open ImageMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
This project is nearly identical to the Introduction project. Of course, some of 
the images are missing... and that’s where you come in. Let’s add some 
images to this project.
6. Insert an image onto slide 1.
if necessary, go to slide 1
choose Media > Image
navigate to the Captivate9Data folder
from the images_animation folder, open Skybackground.png
The image, which is quite large, is inserted in the middle of the slide. The 
other slide objects are behind the newly inserted image. The image is so big, 
its left edge is hanging off the left side of the slide and is bleeding onto the 
Pasteboard. (As first mentioned on page 16, the Pasteboard is the large area 
surrounding your slide. It can be used for items that you aren’t ready to 
delete. Objects on the Pasteboard do not appear in the published version of 
your lesson. However, if part of an object is on the slide and part of the object

85
is on the Pasteboard, you will end up with a nice bleed effect you’ve likely seen 
in print publications such as magazines and newspapers.)
7. Change the slide’s view magnification.
choose View > Magnification > 50%
8. Manually resize an image.
with the image you just inserted on slide 1 selected, position your mouse 
pointer over the resizing handle in the upper right of the image
drag the handle down and to the left to make the image much smaller
Although resizing an image by dragging its handles is perfectly fine in some 
instances, you could easily end up with a resized image that is out of 
proportion. You’ll learn a better way to resize in just a minute. First, let’s get 
the image back to its original size.
9. Reset an image size.
with the image is still selected, select the Style tab on the Properties 
Inspector
click the Reset To Original Size button
The image should be the back to its original size. The location of the image has 
changed, which you will alter next. I often receive questions as to the value of 
the Reset To Original Size button. Many people believe that it would be just as 
easy to Undo the image resize as an alternative to clicking the Reset To 
Original Size button. It’s true that clicking the Reset button and using the 
Undo command achieves the same result. However, the Undo command is 
valuable only as long as the project is open. If you close the project and save 
your changes, the Undo command won’t work when you reopen the project. 
The Reset button always works.

Student Activity: Transform an Image
1. Ensure that the ImageMe project is still open.
2. Use the Properties Inspector to change the size of an image.
with the Skybackground image on slide 1 still selected, click the Options 
tab on the Properties Inspector
in the Transform area, ensure that Constrain proportions is selected
You are about to make the image a bit larger by changing the W value. With 
Constrain proportions selected, the height of the image changes proportionally 
when you change the width.
change the W value to 1400
The H value should automatically change to 649.
3. Specify a specific slide position for the image.
on the Transform area, change the X value to -412
change the Y value to -3
The X value controls the horizontal position of the selected object; the Y value 
controls the vertical slide position. The image should now be bleeding onto the 
Pasteboard (mostly on the left side of the slide). Because the image is so 
large, you cannot see the slide objects that were on the slide before you 
imported the image. You’ll send the image behind the other slide objects next.
4. Send the main image behind the other slide objects.
with the cloud image still selected, choose Modify > Arrange > 
Send to Back

Images Confidence Check
1. Right-click the cloud image and choose Show for the 
rest of the slide (so that the image is on the slide along 
with all of the other slide objects).
Note: When right-clicking the image, be careful. There 
are several objects on the slide. By right-clicking the edge 
of the image, you’ll be sure you’re editing the timing for 
the image, not one of the other slide objects.
2. On the Timing Inspector, Transition area, change the 
Transition to Fade In Only.
3. Still working on slide 1, insert the image named Jill.bmp.
4. Transform the image as follows:
Your slide should look like this:

14. Transform the BannerBottomSlide1 image as follows:
15. Set the Timing and Transition for the BannerBottomSlide1 image as follows:
The first slide should look like the picture below. Remember that much of the 
background image is bleeding off the left side of the slide, which is the reason 
things look a bit unbalanced. For a more accurate view of what your learners 
will see, observe the Filmstrip thumbnail of slide 1 (where you’ll see that the 
left edge is cut off) or preview the first few slides.
16. Save and close the project.

The Library
Your slides can contain audio, background images, images, animations, linked 
PowerPoint presentations, and more. Those assets are monitored by Captivate’s 
Library. Once the Library is opened, you can add previously imported assets onto any 
slide by dragging the object’s name from the Library and onto the slide.
Student Activity: Use the Library
1. Open the MoreImageMe project.
2. Show the Library.
from the top right of the Captivate window, click Library
3. Use the Library to add an image to slide 2.
on the Library, scroll down to the Images folder
All of the images you added during the previous activities in this module are 
listed in the Library. There are also images you didn’t add—these were added 
by the original developer who worked on this project. 
Notice that there is a Use Count column in the Library. 
Every time you use an image in the project, the Use Count goes up by one. 
If you delete every occurrence of the image from the project slides, a copy of 
the image still remains in the Library. Because the developer of this project 
inserted and then deleted slide images, some of the images in the Library 
show a 0 as a Use Count.
from the middle of the Images folder on the Library, select 
BrandingLogo.png (if necessary, make the Name column wider so you 
can see the names of the images)
At the top of the Library, notice that there is a preview of the selected image.

2. Insert an image.
go to the last slide in the project
choose Media > Image
from the images_animation folder, open betty_baby.jpg
3. Delete the betty_baby image you just inserted on the slide.
In the Library, notice that the image you deleted is still listed, even though it 
is no longer used in the project. Although unused assets have no effect on the 
size of a published lesson, unused assets can bloat working project files. I 
suggest that you routinely remove unused assets from your project (which 
lowers the overall size of the project).
4. Delete unused Library items.
from the top of the Library, click the Select Unused Items tool 
 
Three Library objects are unused. They are now selected and can be deleted.

Image Editing
Although Captivate is not an image editing program like Adobe Photoshop, you can 
control several aspects of an image, including flipping it horizontally and vertically, 
controlling its rotation, setting its brightness and contrast, and cropping it. During 
the next activity, you will crop part of the image you inserted onto the second slide.
Student Activity: Crop and Rename an Image
1. Ensure that the MoreImageMe project is still open.
2. Crop an image.
go to slide 2
select the image you added to the slide earlier
Clearly, this image needs your help... nobody is asking how the “Ooops” text 
got into the image, but it’s got to go.
on the Properties Inspector, click the Style tab

The words “Ooops. Crop Me” have been cropped out of the image. Because 
you deselected Constraint Proportion, you were able to control exactly how 
much of the image you cropped.
On the Library, notice that there is a second BrandingLogo image (the original 
and the one you cropped). The newer image, BrandingLogo(2), needs a new 
name.
3. Rename an image.

Student Activity: Remove a Background Color
1. Ensure that the MoreImageMe project is still open.
2. On slide 2, notice that the cropped NextTurn image (BrandingLogoCropped) 
has a white background. You’ll remove the white so that the image works with 
the background.
3. Remove a background color from an image.
with the NextTurn image selected, on the Properties Inspector, Style 
tab, click the rectangle to the right of the Make the selected color 
transparent icon
select the Eyedropper tool
using the Eyedropper tool, click in the white part of the NextTurn image
The white part of the image should be deleted.
Admittedly, the results aren’t perfect. For instance, there’s still a bit of white 
around the letters. Intense image editing would be best performed in a 
dedicated image editing program like Adobe Photoshop. But that’s not the 
point here... I love the fact that if you’re in a pinch, there’s a great deal you 
can do directly within Captivate that adequately gets the job done.

Properties Confidence Check
1. Transform the BrandingLogoCropped image as follows:
2. Set the Timing for the NextTurn image to Display For to Rest of Project
3. From the Timing area, select Place Object on Top.
4. Change the Transition to No Transition.
5. Starting with slide 2, preview the next five slides.
As the slides play, notice that the logo appears in the same location on every 
slide. Using the Rest of Project Display time is a handy trick that lets you 
repeat slide objects without having to create master slides (a topic that I cover 
in Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond the Essentials) or pasting the images on every 
slide. The Place Object on Top option ensures that the 
BrandingLogoCropped image always appears in front of competing slide 
objects.
6. Close the preview.
7. Still working on slide 2, set the timing for the “All rights reserved” text caption 
to Display For to Rest of Project
8. Preview the next five slides.
Now both the caption and the image appear on every slide.
9. Close the preview and save your work.

Characters
Finding quality royalty-free photographs, especially of cut out people that you can 
use throughout your lessons as learner guides, is always a challenge. Fortunately, 
Captivate comes with a wonderful assortment of Characters (via the Media tool). 
There are multiple Character categories (such as Business and Medicine). Each 
category contains multiple models and poses. 
Student Activity: Insert Characters
1. Ensure that the MoreImageMe project is still open.
2. Go to slide 5.
3. Insert a Character.
choose Media > Characters
The Characters dialog box opens.
from the Category drop-down menu, choose Business
from the left side of the dialog box, select any character
from the middle of the dialog box, select any pose
from the right side of the dialog box, select Half
click the OK button
Note: If you receive an alert message about missing assets after 
clicking the OK button, you can download the missing Characters for 
free. However, the assets are large and could take a significant amount 
of time to download. Because the first pose for every Character is 
usually available, consider using that pose and download the assets 
later.

Assets
Adobe teamed with the eLearning Brothers and Captivate includes thousands of free 
eLearning Brother assets (templates, cut out people, etc.) that you can use in your 
projects. Download images from the eLearning Brothers website are automatically 
installed in the Media category when you access Characters.
Student Activity: Insert Assets
1. Ensure that the MoreImageMe project is still open.
2. Download an asset from the eLearning Brothers website.
on the toolbar, click Assets

Smart Shapes
If you’re a PowerPoint user, you’ve long appreciated the ability to draw just about 
any kind of shape you need on your slides using AutoShapes. In Captivate, you have 
a similar ability via the Smart Shapes feature. You’ll find myriad shapes from which 
to choose, including Callouts, Banners, and other wacky shapes.
Student Activity: Insert a Cloud Callout
1. Open the SmartShapeMe project from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Insert a Cloud Callout Smart Shape.
go to slide 5
choose Shapes > Cloud Callout
using the Cloud Callout Smart Shape, draw a large callout from the image 
of the woman diagonally up and to the right

Smart Shapes Confidence Check
1. Insert a Cloud Callout Smart Shape above the image of 
the man.
2. After drawing the second callout above the man, you’re 
probably concerned with the direction of the callout... it’s 
not pointing at the man. That’s easily fixed. Drag the 
bottom yellow resizing handle toward the man’s head 
to change the direction of the Smart Shape.
 
3. Double-click within the first Cloud Callout (the callout above the woman) and 
type the following:
RESOLUTION: 
The act of resolving or determining a course of action
4. Double-click within the second Cloud Callout and type the following:
CONFLICT: 
To come into collision or disagreement

Inspector, change the font to Verdana.
6. Change the font size to 17.
7. Change the text alignment to Align Center. 
8. Change the Spacing to 1.5
Notice that only the selected Smart Shape has been formatted. If you want 
the other Smart Shape to use the same formatting, you’ll need to update the 
[Default Smart Shape Style].

© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
105
Background Editing
If there are problems with your slide backgrounds (perhaps a rogue author has 
doodled on the slide), you could re-record just the slide containing the problem. 
Although this would fix the problem, it might take a significant amount of work to get 
your screen in just the right position so you can re-create the screen capture. Even if 
you think you’ve got everything just perfect, there might be subtle differences 
between the original screen capture and the new one—differences you might not 
notice until it’s too late. 
If your background contains something you want to delete and your background is 
any solid color, you can create a mask (insert an image or highlight box using the 
same color as the background, cover the problem, and then merge the image or 
highlight box into the background). 
Student Activity: Create an Image Mask
1. Open MaskPhotoshopMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Go to slide 8.
There is an image on the slide that needs your attention... it’s an image that 
isn’t just sitting on the slide; it’s been merged with the slide background. 
Getting rid of the image isn’t going to be as simple as selecting and deleting it. 
Because the image is part of the slide background, you’ll need to create a 
mask to hide it.
choose Objects > Highlight Box
A highlight box appears in the middle of the slide.
reposition and resize the Highlight Box until it completely covers the doodle
   
In a moment, you will be merging the Highlight Box onto the slide’s 
background, making the doodle art just a bad memory. But not so fast. If you 
merge the Highlight Box now, the doodle will be gone, only to be replaced by a 
blue box. Let’s change the color of the Highlight Box from blue to white and 
then proceed with the merge process.

3. Change the color of the Highlight Box to white.
with the Highlight Box still selected, locate the Fill area on the Properties 
Inspector (it’s on the Style tab)
click the Fill tool and change the color to white
4. Merge the image into the background.
with the white highlight box still selected, choose Modify > 
Merge with the background
click the Yes button
The Highlight Box is gone. The doodle art is gone. And all is right with the 
world.
5. Save your work.

Integrating Photoshop
You can import native Adobe Photoshop files (PSD files) directly onto Captivate 
slides, even if you don’t own or use Photoshop. When you import a PSD file, the 
layers created in Photoshop are preserved, giving you incredible control over how 
and when the objects on the layers appear on a slide.
Student Activity: Delete a Slide Background
1. Ensure that the MaskPhotoshopMe project is still open.
2. Delete the background image for slide 1.
using the Filmstrip, select slide 1
choose Edit > Find Background in the Library
The Library opens and the ReplaceMe background image is selected.
right-click the ReplaceMe image in the Library selected and choose 
Delete
Because the image is being used by slide 1, you’ll be asked to confirm the 
action.
click the Yes button
The slide’s background has been deleted. Even so, notice that the slide and 
the slide objects (the button and background audio) are intact.

Student Activity: Work with Photoshop Layers
1. Ensure that the MaskPhotoshopMe project is still open.
2. Import a Photoshop file onto slide 1.
with slide 1 selected, choose File > Import > Photoshop File
from the Captivate9Data folder, open the images_animation folder
open LessonBackground.psd
The Import dialog box appears. This Photoshop file contains layers named 
Logo, SkillsDrills, etc. You could elect to flatten the layers (by selecting Import 
as Flattened Image), which is exactly what the slide contained before you 
deleted its background image a moment ago. The advantage of importing the 
layers is that you can control when each object on each layer appears on your 
slide, paving the way for some interesting transition effects in your Captivate 
project.
from the Import as area at the right side of the dialog box, ensure that 
Layers is selected
click the OK button
Display the Timeline and notice that each of the Photoshop layers has been 
assigned a row in the Timeline.
3. Extend the playtime for the Photoshop layers.
still working on slide 1, select Logo on the Timeline
press and hold [Shift] on your keyboard
click once on the last image on the Timeline (Background)
release the [Shift] key

Image Slideshows
If you have a collection of images on your hard drive or server, you can use 
Captivate’s Image slideshow feature to quickly create a nifty slideshow.
Student Activity: Create an Image Slideshow
1. Create an Image slideshow project.
choose File > New Project > Image Slideshow
The New Image Slideshow dialog box appears.
from the Select drop-down menu, select 640 x 480 
click the OK button
2. Find the images to be used in the slideshow.

There are 15 images within the folder. You will be using all of the images in 
the Slideshow.
select all of the images in the folder and then click the Open button
The Resize/Crop Image dialog box opens.
click the OK button
The images are imported into a new untitled project and set as the 
background on each slide.

Transitions Confidence Check
1. Preview the project.
The slideshow works, but the slides move along just a bit 
too quickly.
2. Close the preview.
3. On the Filmstrip, select the first slide.
4. Scroll down the Filmstrip until you see the last slide.
5. Press [shift] and select the last slide. (All of the slides 
should now be selected, and you can release the [shift] key.)
6. On the Timing Inspector, change the Slide Duration for the slides to 5 
seconds.
7. Preview the project. 
The timing is better. But wouldn’t it be even better to have a transition 
between one slide and the next? You bet...
8. Select the first slide on the Filmstrip.
9. From the Transition drop-down menu on the Timing Inspector, select any 
Transition you like.
10. Repeat this process for a few more of the slides.
11. When finished, preview the project.
12. Once satisfied with the transitions, close the project. (You can save the project 
to the Captivate9Data folder with any name that you like, or you can close 
the project without saving it.)

Mouse Effects
If your lesson is intended to demonstrate an application, including the Mouse pointer 
is a good idea. If you do include the Mouse pointer, you can also include a visual 
Mouse click and click sound that further enhances the user experience.
Student Activity: Control Mouse Effects
1. Open MouseVisualMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Preview the project.
choose Preview > Project
This project is a demonstration showing new computer users how to create a 
new folder on the computer. The slides contain images (you learned how to 
add images beginning on page 84) and Text Captions (you learned how to add 
captions on page 66). As the Mouse moves from slide to slide, there is no 
visual indicator that a click is occurring, and no sound effect to accompany the 
click. 
3. Add a click sound to the Mouse on slide 4.
close the preview and then go to slide 4
This is where the Mouse goes to the File menu and the menu is clicked. It’s 
the perfect place to add both a visual Mouse click and click sound.
on the Timeline double-click the Mouse object
 
on the Properties Inspector, select Mouse Click Sound
ensure Single-click is selected from the drop-down menu
4. Add a visual Mouse click to the Mouse pointer on slide 4.
ensure the Mouse on slide 4 is still selected
on the Properties Inspector, select Show Mouse Click 
select Custom from the drop-down menu and select any of the Mouse 
clicks you like from the drop-down menu (you can preview the Mouse click 
visual by clicking the Play button to the right of the selection)

Visual Click Confidence Check
1. Go to slide 3 and preview the next five slides. 
(Preview > Next 5 slides)
When slide 4 plays, you should see and hear the Mouse 
click.
2. Add a visual Mouse click and Mouse click sound to the 
Mouse pointer on slides 5, 6, and 8.
3. Use the Timing Inspector to change the Transition for slide 
2 to Wipe.
4. Save your work.
5. Preview the project.
As the lesson plays, pay particular attention to the Wipe transition you added 
that softens the abrupt jump between slides 1 and 2. In addition, notice the 
visual Mouse clicks and sounds you added.
6. When the preview is finished, close the preview.
7. Save and close the project.

Pointer Paths and Types
When you record a lesson using Captivate, every move you make with the Mouse can 
be recorded, including menu selections, dialog box selections, and the path your 
Mouse takes as you move it around the screen. Captivate includes the ability to easily 
change the pointer path without having to re-record the lesson.
After you record a Demonstration (you learned how on page 48) that includes the 
Mouse cursor, you can change the way the Mouse pointer looks on a single Captivate 
slide or throughout the project. The pointer can be changed to a variety of icons, 
such as a hand, a vertical resize pointer, or a drag pointer. If you are not happy with 
the pointer icons that come with Captivate, you can select any system pointer or 
existing CUR (cursor) file on your hard drive or network as the pointer image. 
Student Activity: Edit a Mouse Path
1. Open PointerPathMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Hide slide objects.
go to slide 3
on the Timeline, look to the left of the caption containing the words 
“Watch as...”
click Show/Hide Item (the little circle just beneath the eyeball icon)
The little circle turns into a red X when clicked. The Show/Hide Item is a 
toggle. To Show an item, click the red X, and it returns to the shape of a circle.
With the selected caption hidden, it’s easier to focus on the slide’s Mouse 
pointer. Notice that the tip of the pointer (the tip of the Mouse pointer is often 
referred to as the “hot spot”) is pointing just to the right of the “e” in “File.” It 
might look a bit better if the hot spot of the Mouse pointer is optically centered 
over the word “File.”

Module 6: Pointers, Paths, Boxes, and Buttons > Pointer Paths and Types > Edit a Mouse Path

117
3. Edit the pointer path.
drag the Mouse pointer up and to the left just a bit so that it is more 
optically centered over the word File
During the recording process (you learned about recording screen actions on 
page 46), it’s possible that you made a mistake and clicked the wrong part of 
the screen. In that instance, Captivate creates a screen capture, and your 
Mouse is shown in the wrong part of the screen. Ouch! You’ve just learned 
that you can move the Mouse pointer location in Captivate after the recording 
process. How slick is that? Re-record a lesson? I don’t think so!
4. Go to slide 4.
Notice that the Mouse pointer on slide 4 didn’t get the memo from the Mouse 
pointer on slide 3 (informing it that it needs to move up and to the left). You 
can get a better look at the problem by switching between slides 3 and 4, and 
you see the pointer jump between the two slides. Hold on for a bit of magic as 
you tell the pointer on slide 4 to match the position of the pointer on slide 3.
5. Align the slide position of the Mouse pointer with the previous slide.
still working on slide 4, select the Mouse
choose Modify > Mouse > Align to Previous slide
The position of the Mouse pointer on slide 4 should now match the position 
you established for the Mouse pointer on slide 3. Without this wonderful 
feature, you would have been forced to drag the pointer on slide 4 a bit at a 
time, and then constantly switch between slides 3 and 4 to ensure that the 
alignment is perfect. The Align to feature makes quick work of the process.
6. Return to slide 3 and show the text caption that you hid a moment ago.
7. Change the Mouse pointer type.
go to slide 9
Notice the Mouse pointer type is a standard white pointer.
select the Mouse

118
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
on the Properties Inspector, Display area, click the > twice and then 
select the Hand Pointer
On the slide, the Mouse pointer now looks like a hand pointer. This change 
affects only the pointer on slide 9.
Note: If you wanted to use this pointer type on all of the pointers in the 
current project, you could right-click the pointer on the slide and 
choose Use the current mouse pointer for all slides.
8. Save your work.

Highlight Boxes
In addition to serving as background masks (you learned how to create a mask on 
page 105), Highlight Boxes provide a great way to grab the learner’s attention... they 
are especially helpful if a slide is cluttered. Like most objects in Captivate, you can 
control the appearance of Highlight Boxes via Object Styles the length of time they 
are on stage via the Timeline or the Timing Inspector.
Student Activity: Clone an Object Style
1. Ensure that the PointerPathMe project is still open.
2. Clone an existing style.
choose Edit > Object Style Manager
at the far left of the dialog box, click the triangle to expand the 
Standard Objects area
select Highlight Box
from the middle column, select [Default Blue Highlight Box Style]
at the bottom of the column, click the Clone button
The selected style has been duplicated. You can now give the duplicate any 
name you like and then edit its attributes.
in the Name area at the right, change the name to Custom Highlight Box 
Style
from the Fill & Stroke area, select any Fill, Stroke Color, and Width you 
like
change the Transition to Fade In Only
click the OK button

Student Activity: Insert a Highlight Box
1. Ensure that the PointerPathMe project is still open.
2. Insert a Highlight Box.
go to slide 3
choose Objects > Highlight Box
The New Highlight Box box appears on the slide using the attributes of the 
[Default Blue Highlight Box Style].
3. Apply a different style to the new Highlight Box.
from the Style Name drop-down menu on the Properties Inspector, 
choose Custom Highlight Box Style
The appearance of the selected Highlight Box should match the attributes of 
the style you created a moment ago. If you are unhappy with the appearance 
of the object, you can at any time return to the Object Style Manager, select 
the style, and edit it.
4. Resize and reposition the Highlight Box.
on the slide, drag the Highlight Box up and to the left and resize it so that 
it covers just the File menu
5. Review object timing on the Timeline.
On the Timeline, notice that the Text Caption and Highlight Box are both set to 
appear right away and play for three seconds. After that, the Mouse appears.
6. Preview a single slide.
choose Preview > Play slide
As expected, the Highlight Box fades in as the slide plays and stays around as 
long as the text caption. Then the Mouse does its thing. However, the timing

121
for the caption is a bit off. You might have noticed that the caption stuck 
around a tiny bit longer than the Highlight Box. The reason? The Highlight Box 
has a Transition of Fade In Only. The caption’s Transition is set to Fade In and 
Out. You’ll change that next.
7. Update and then save changes to an existing style.
select the Text Caption on slide 3
on the Timing Inspector, change the Transition to Fade In Only
select the Properties Inspector
From the Style Name area at the top of the Properties Inspector, notice the 
plus sign to the left of the Default Caption Style. The plus sign indicates 
changes have been made to the selected caption that do not match the 
attributes of the style. 
click the menu at the right of Style Name and choose Save changes to 
Existing Style button
The attributes for all of the captions in the project have been updated and now 
reflect the Fade In Only Transition.
8. Play the slide.
Now the timing and effects for both the Highlight Box and Text Caption match.
9. Save the project.

An image button is added to the middle of the slide. Next you’ll control what 
happens when the learner interacts with the button. The Actions tab on the 
Properties Inspector has several options in the On Success drop-down 
menu. For instance, you can select Continue. With this Action selected, the 
slide continues to play the remaining time on the Timeline before the learner is 
taken to the next slide. Alternatively, you can elect to jump the learner to a 
specific slide in the project. Or you can elect to have the button play a sound. 
In this instance, you’d like the button to take the learner to the next slide 
when the button is clicked. 
5. Set the button’s Action.
ensure the Button is selected
on the Properties Inspector, select the Actions tab
from the On Success drop-down menu, ensure Go to the next slide is 
selected
Next you’ll set the timing for the button. Although you can do whatever you 
want with the timing, in this instance, you’d like the button to appear on the 
slide right away and stick around as long as the slide plays.
6. Set the button’s Timing.
ensure the button is still selected
select the Timing Inspector
from the Display For drop-down menu, select Rest of Slide
ensure that Appear After is set to 0 sec

7. Resize and reposition the button similar to the picture below.
8. Preview the Next 5 slides.
As the first slide plays, notice that the action stops too soon—not all of the 
slide objects have had a chance to appear. You will fix that problem next.
9. Close the preview.

Student Activity: Control Appear After Timing
1. Ensure that the PointerPathMe project is still open.
2. Edit a button’s Properties so that it pauses the slide after an appropriate 
amount of time.
select the Button on slide 1
select the Timing Inspector 
change Pause After to 4.5 seconds
Setting Pause After to 4.5 seconds gives the other slide objects enough time 
to appear on the slide before the slide action stops.
3. Edit the Properties of the button to show a Hand Cursor.
select the Properties Inspector 
on the Actions tab, Others area, select Hand Cursor
4. Preview the First 5 slides.
After slide 1 appears, notice that all of the slide elements show up on the slide, 
and then the lesson stops—waiting for you to click the button.
5. Position your Mouse pointer over the button and notice that your Mouse 
pointer changes to a hand Mouse cursor—thanks to the Hand Cursor option 
you selected.
6. Click the button to jump to the next slide in the lesson.
7. Close the preview, and then save and close the project.

Rollover Captions
You learned how to create Text Captions beginning on page 66. Although similar to 
Text Captions, Rollover Captions consist of two things: a caption and a rectangular 
“hot spot.” The Rollover Captions appear in your published projects only when the 
learner moves the mouse over the hot spot. Rollover Captions are especially useful 
for creating tooltips within an application. To see an example of a working tooltip, 
point to any tool on any Captivate toolbar (the text that appears is a tooltip).
Student Activity: Insert a Rollover Caption
1. Open MouseSkills from the Captivate9Data folder. 
2. Preview the project. 
This project has similar elements, such as graphics, buttons, and object timing 
that you have learned to create during previous lessons. During the lessons 
that follow, you will be inserting Rollover Captions on slide 2 (and Rollover 
Images on slide 3).
3. Close the preview.
4. Observe the styles used for the Rollover Captions in the Object Style Manager.
choose Edit > Object Style Manager
from the top left of the dialog box, expand Standard Objects
expand Captions
from the Captions area, select Rollover Caption
in the middle of the dialog box, notice that there is a caption called 
RolloverCaptions
at the top right of the dialog box, notice that RolloverCaptions is 
Set As Default
The RolloverCaptions style is an Object Style that I created by cloning the 
Default Caption Style. You learned about cloning on page 119.
lower down the Standard Objects list, select Rollover Area
at the right of the dialog box, observe the settings in the Fill & Stroke 
area and Transition areas

I’ve already set up the style for you and it will result in a transparent rollover 
area. If you’d like a refresher on working with the Object Style Manager and 
styles in general, review the activities beginning on page 72.
click the Cancel button
5. Insert a Rollover Caption onto a slide.
go to slide 2
You’re going to be adding rollover areas and captions for each of the images 
on this slide.
choose Objects > Rollover Caption
Two things appear on your slide: a Rollover Caption and a Rollover Area. Both 
objects are formatted to match the styles you just reviewed in the Object 
Style Manager.
type Excellent, you hit number 1! into the Text Caption
6. Change the caption’s Callout.
with just the Rollover Caption selected, go to the Properties Inspector, 
Style tab
select the first Callout
7. Move and resize the Rollover Caption.
drag the Rollover Caption just above and to the right of the image of 
the number 1
resize the Rollover Caption to suit your taste

8. Move and resize the Rollover Area.
drag the Rollover Area over the image of the number 1
resize the Rollover Area so that it just covers the image of number 1
The position of the Rollover Caption and Rollover Area should look similar to 
the picture below.
9. Save your work.
Rollover Captions Confidence Check
1. With the Rollover area selected, go to the Timing 
Inspector and change the Appear After time to 3 sec.
On the Timeline, notice that the left edge of the Rollover Area now lines up 
with 00:03. Why did I ask you to make the timing change? Take a further look 
at the Timeline. The four slide images appear on the slide at the 3-second 
mark. By delaying the availability of the Rollover Area, you have ensured that 
overanxious learners won’t be able to use the Rollover Area and see the 
Rollover Caption until the images have appeared on the slide.
2. Preview the project. 
3. After the numbers appear on slide 2, point to the number 1. 

Module 7: Rollovers and Zooms > Rollover Captions > Rollover Captions Confidence Check

Rollover Images
You learned about working with images beginning on page 84. Any image you can 
insert on a slide can instead be a Rollover Image. Similar to Rollover Captions, 
Rollover Images consist of an image and a rectangular “hot spot.” Rollover Images 
appear in the published project only when the user moves the mouse over the hot 
spot. You might consider using Rollover Images within your projects as a way to offer 
enhanced views of a dialog box, tool, or schematic.
Student Activity: Insert a Rollover Image
1. Ensure that the MouseSkills project is still open. 
2. Insert a Rollover Image onto a slide.
go to slide 3
choose Objects > Rollover Image
The Open dialog box appears. You can use several types of images as Rollover 
Images including jpeg, gif, bmp, emf, png, and pict.
from the Captivate9Data\images_animation folder, open 
mouse1.bmp
Two things appear on slide 3: the mouse image (which is the Rollover Image) 
and a Rollover Area. The Rollover Area is behind the mouse image. The two 
objects are shown pulled apart in the image below.
Rollover Images Confidence Check
1. Move both the Rollover Area and Rollover Image 
anywhere you’d like on the slide.
2. Insert a second Rollover Image that uses the mouse2 
image.
3. Insert a third Rollover Image that uses the mouse3 
image.
4. Preview the project and test the rollovers on slide 3.
5. When finished, close the preview.
6. Save and close the project.

Module 7: Rollovers and Zooms > Rollover Slidelets > Insert a Rollover Slidelet

Rollover Slidelets
Rollover Slidelets are mini slides within a slide. Similar to Rollover Captions and 
Images, slidelets appear only when the user moves the mouse over a specified area 
on the slide. Unlike Rollover Captions (which can contain only text) and Rollover 
Images (which can contain only images), slidelets can contain images, text, audio, 
and video. In addition, you can attach navigation controls to a slidelet.
Student Activity: Insert a Rollover Slidelet
1. Open RolloverSlideletMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
This project should look familiar to you. You worked with this project when you 
learned to create Text Captions (see page 66).
2. Insert a Rollover slidelet.
go to slide 10 (the last slide)
You’re going to add a Rollover Slidelet on this slide. If learners click the View 
menu (indicated in the Text Caption), they see the menu items. If they don’t 
care to click, they won’t see the menu.
choose Objects > Rollover Slidelet
Two things appear on the slide: the Rollover Slidelet Area and the Slidelet. 
Although the two objects look similar, the Rollover Slidelet Area (which is 
smaller and the only one of the two objects containing descriptive text) serves 
as the interactive area. The Slidelet appears when the learner moves the 
mouse over the Rollover Slidelet Area (or clicks the area). Although the 
Rollover Slidelet Area contains the words “Rollover Slidelet Area,” that text 
disappears as you make the Rollover Slidelet Area smaller.
3. Move and resize the Rollover Slidelet Area.
drag the Rollover Slidelet Area (the smaller of the two objects) over the 
View menu on the slide background; then resize it so that it is the same 
size as the View menu

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
134
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
4. Set the Slidelet to “Stick” if the Rollover Slidelet Area is clicked by the learner.
with the resized and repositioned Rollover Slidelet Area still selected, go 
to the Properties Inspector and select the Actions tab
select Stick Slidelet
When the learner clicks the Rollover Slidelet Area, the Stick Slidelet option 
means the Slidelet continues to display for a few seconds, even when the 
learner moves the mouse away from the Rollover Slidelet Area. Alternatively, 
you could have selected from a list of On Rollover actions, such as Jump to 
Slide or Open URL or File.
5. Change the size and slide position of the Slidelet.
select the Slidelet (the Slidelet is the larger of the two objects)
Note: Ensure you’ve selected the Slidelet, not the Rollover Slidelet 
Area. You are going to both resize the Slidelet and import an image into 
it. If you select with the Rollover Slidelet Area by mistake, you won’t be 
able to insert the image.
on the Properties Inspector, select the Options tab
from the Transform area, deselect Constrain proportions
change the X value to 83
change the W to 112
change the Y value to 79
change the H to 282
The Slidelet should be positioned just beneath the View menu. The size of the 
Slidelet matches the image you’re about to import into the Slidelet.

6. Insert an image into the Slidelet.
ensure that the Slidelet is still selected (again, the Slidelet is the larger of 
the two objects)
choose Media > Image
from the Captivate9Data\images_animation folder, open 
ViewMenu.jpg
The image has been inserted within the Slidelet. If the Slidelet were larger, 
you would be able to move the image around the Slidelet, but you would be 
unable to drag it outside of the Slidelet.
7. Preview From this slide.
with slide 10 selected, choose Preview > From this slide
8. Click the Rollover Slidelet Area you positioned over the View menu.
The Rollover Slidelet appears with the menu image you inserted. If you move 
your mouse away from the Rollover Slidelet Area, the Rollover Slidelet should 
stay for a few seconds and then disappear (this is the Stick behavior in 
action). Alternatively, you can point to the Rollover Slidelet Area. Using this 
technique, the menu image appears until you move your mouse away from 
the Rollover Slidelet Area.
9. Close the Preview.
10. Save your work and close the project.

Zoom Areas
You learned how Highlight Boxes can grab the learner’s attention on page 119. Zoom 
Areas offer you an alternative method of grabbing the eye. Zoom Areas consist of 
two parts: the Zoom Source (the area you want to highlight on the screen) and the 
Zoom Destination (the enlarged view of the Zoom Area). During the next activity, 
you will use a Zoom Area to emphasize a specific tool in Adobe Photoshop. 
Student Activity: Insert a Zoom Area
1. Open PhotoshopVignette from the Captivate9Data folder.
This project was originally created by Barbara Ash, Adobe Certified Instructor 
and Captivate developer and design specialist. Barbara created the project to 
help her niece learn Adobe Photoshop.
2. Preview the project.
Notice on slide 2 that the narrator is talking about the need to press and hold 
a tool on the toolbar at the left. This would be a perfect opportunity to use a 
Zoom Area to make the tool a bit larger for your learners.
3. Close the preview.
4. Go to slide 2.
You’ll be adding the Zoom area at the left of the background (when the 
Rectangular Marquee Tool is mentioned by the narrator).
5. Insert a Zoom Area.
still working on slide 2, choose Objects > Zoom Area
Two objects appear in the middle of the slide: the Zoom Destination and the 
Zoom Source. The appearance of these objects is controlled by Object Styles. 
As with the Rollover Captions you worked with earlier in this module, the 
Zoom styles have already formatted via the Object Style Manager.

6. Reposition the Zoom Source and Zoom Destination.
drag the Zoom Source over the second tool in the toolbar at the left 
(although the two objects look similar, look carefully at both, and you’ll 
notice that the Zoom Source contains the words Zoom Source)
resize the Zoom Source so that it is the same size as the tool
drag the Zoom Destination below the menu shown to the right of the 
toolbar and resize it as shown in the image below
7. Set the Appear time for the Zoom Area to match the narration.
select the Zoom Source (the first object you resized)
on the Timing Inspector, change the Appear After to 2 sec
Note: If you don’t see a Timing Inspector, first ensure you’ve selected 
the Zoom Source, not the Zoom Destination. If you’re sure you’ve 
selected the Zoom Source and there isn’t a Timing Inspector, click the 
Properties icon in the upper right of the Captivate window to hide and 
then re-open the Inspectors.

The narrator mentions the tool behind the Zoom Source at exactly two 
seconds. You’ve just set it up so that the zoom occurs as the tool is being 
discussed by the narrator. 
8. Set the length of time for the zoom.
ensure the Zoom Source is still selected
on the Timing Inspector, change the Zoom for to 2 sec
The Zoom for timing controls how long the zoom takes. You’ve just specified 
that the zoom take exactly two seconds.
9. Preview the lesson From this slide.
Notice that the tool mentioned by the narrator zooms out from the 
Zoom Source to the Zoom Destination.
10. Close the Preview.

Object Audio
You can import two types of audio files into a Captivate project: WAV and MP3. You 
can add audio to just about anything. During the activity that follows, you will import 
audio to some rollover captions and rollover images.
WAV (WAVE): WAV files are one of the original digital audio standards. Although 
high in quality, WAV files can be very large. In fact, typical WAV audio files can easily 
take up to several megabytes of storage per minute of playing time. If your learner 
has a slow Internet connection, the download time for large files is unacceptable.
MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III): Developed in Germany by the Fraunhofer Institute, 
MP3 files are compressed digital audio files. File sizes in this format are typically 90 
percent smaller than WAV files.
Note: To learn more about digital audio formats, visit 
www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/2005/
digital_audio_formats.asp.
Student Activity: Import Audio onto a Slide Object
1. Open AudioMe from the Captivate9Data folder. 
2. Add a sound effect to a Rollover Caption.
go to slide 2 and select the Excellent, you hit number 1! caption
choose Audio > Import to > Object
The Import Audio dialog box opens. By default, you should be taken to 
the Sound folder that comes with Captivate. (If not, navigate to the folder 
where Captivate is installed (typically Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Captivate 9 
on Windows; Applications/Adobe Captivate 9 on a Macintosh. Open the 
Gallery folder and then open the Sound folder.)
open Electronic Tink.mp3
The Object Audio dialog box opens.
3. Preview the sound.
on the Add/Replace tab, click the Play button to hear the audio clip
click the Close button
The audio file is attached to the selected caption. At this point there is no way 
to know that the audio file has been attached to the object without previewing. 
You’ll learn later that there is a dialog box called Advanced Audio 
Management that lets you see all of the audio files used in the project (and 
delete, export, update, and preview them).

Object Audio Confidence Check
1. Preview the project.
2. When you get to slide 2, use your mouse to point to 
Image 1.
The sound effect should play when the Rollover Caption 
appears.
3. Close the Preview.
4. Attach sounds to the remaining Rollover Captions on 
slide 2.
Note: You can use any of the sound files available in the Sound folder or the 
sound files in the Captivate9Data\audio folder. You will also find hundreds 
of free sound clips online at http://www.grsites.com/sounds.
5. Attach sounds to the Rollover Images on slide 3.
6. Preview the project. There should be a sound effect attached to each Rollover 
Caption on slide 2 and to every Rollover Image on slide 3.
7. When finished, close the preview.

Student Activity: Import Background Audio
1. Ensure that the AudioMe project is still open.
2. Import an audio file that plays for the entire project.
choose Audio > Import to > Background
from the Captivate9Data, audio folder, open 2Step1.mp3
The Background Audio dialog box opens.
from the Options area of the Add/Replace tab, ensure that Loop Audio 
is selected
The audio file you imported is large enough to play for just over one minute. 
By selecting Loop Audio, the music plays over and over. Using this technique, 
you can use smaller audio files for your background music.
ensure that Stop audio at end of project is selected
This option ensures that the background music stops when the project is 
closed by the learner.
ensure that Adjust background audio volume on slides with audio is 
selected
You’ll soon be adding voice-over audio to slides 2 and 3. With Adjust 
background audio volume on slides with audio selected, the background 
music automatically lowers so that you’ll be able to hear the voice-over audio 
without being distracted by the background audio.
drag the slider at the right to 15%
When adjusting the background audio on slides with audio, the slider controls 
how much the background audio volume lowers. I’ve found that 15 percent 
works reasonably well in most circumstances.
click the Save button and then click the Close button
3. Preview the project.
You should be able to hear the background music, and when you get to the 
slides with the sound effects attached to objects, you should still be able to 
hear the sound effects along with the background audio. Because there isn’t 
any voice-over audio on the slide yet, the volume of the background audio 
should not yet lower.
4. Close the preview, save, and close the project.

Module 8: Audio > Slide Notes > Add a Slide Note
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
143
Slide Notes
Slide Notes can serve multiple functions. For instance, if you are working with a team 
of Captivate developers and sharing the Captivate projects, you can add Slide Notes 
that serve as production comments. If you elect to publish your project as a Word 
document (handouts), the Notes can be included and appear within the Word 
document. And because Slide Notes can be displayed when you record voice-overs in 
Captivate, you can use the Slide Notes as a digital narration script. During the next 
activity, you will use the Slide Notes feature to add a narration script that you will use 
when recording your voice (something you will do soon).
Student Activity: Add a Slide Note
1. Open NarrateMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Open the Slide Notes panel.
go to slide 2
choose Window > Slide Notes
At the bottom of the Captivate window, there is now a Slide Notes panel 
where you can add Closed Captions, convert Text-to-Speech, and add Notes.
at the far right of the Slide Notes panel, ensure Notes is selected from the 
drop-down menu
3. Add a slide Note.
on the Notes panel, click in the space below the triangle at the left and type 
Learning to use your mouse is a fundamental computer skill. 
Practice those skills now by pointing to the numbers that have 
appeared on this screen.
During the next activity, you’ll soon use the slide note as a narration script 
when you record voice-over audio.

Recording Audio
Captivate allows you to record and edit your own audio. There are three ways to 
work with sound files: you can attach audio to an entire lesson (running in the 
background), to an individual slide, or to any object on the slide. If you plan to record 
your own audio, you first need a microphone connected to your computer. Once 
you’ve got the microphone, consider the following:
Setup: If you plan to use high-end audio hardware, such as a mixer or preamplifier, 
plug your microphone into the hardware and then plug the hardware into your 
computer’s “line in” port. Set the volume on your mixer or preamplifier to just under 
zero (this will minimize distortion).
Microphone placement: The microphone should be positioned four to six inches 
from your mouth to reduce the chance that nearby sounds are recorded. Ideally, you 
should position the microphone above your nose and point it down at your mouth. 
Also, if you position the microphone just to the side of your mouth, you can soften 
the sound of the letters S and P. 
Microphone technique: It’s a good idea to keep a glass of water close by and, just 
before recording, take a drink. To eliminate the annoying breathing and lip smack 
sounds, turn away from the microphone, take a deep breath, exhale, take another 
deep breath, open your mouth, turn back toward the microphone, and start 
speaking. Speak slowly. When recording for the first time, many people race through 
the content. Take your time.
Student Activity: Calibrate a Microphone
1. Ensure that the NarrateMe project is still open.
2. Select an Audio Input Device and Bitrate.
still working on slide 2, choose Audio > Record to > Slide
The Slide Audio dialog box opens.
at the top of the dialog box, click the link just below the word Device
The Audio Settings dialog box opens.
from the Audio Input Devices, Select drop-down menu, select your 
computer’s microphone (if you’re not sure which device to select, try the 
one that says Built-In Microphone first)

Module 8: Audio > Recording Audio > Calibrate a Microphone
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
145
Note: If there are multiple microphones available in the Select drop-
down menu, you’ll be playing a game of trial and error. Make your best 
guess as to which selection to make. If you are unable to calibrate your 
microphone in the next few moments, return to this drop-down menu 
and try another microphone.
from the Bitrate drop-down menu, ensure that Constant Bitrate is 
selected
Constant Bitrates lead to smaller, nice-sounding audio files. By contrast, 
Variable Bitrates tend to produce audio with a higher, consistent quality level, 
but the file sizes are larger than CBRs. 
if necessary, change the Encoding Bitrate to FM Bitrate (64kbps)
Using a higher Encoding Bitrate setting results in larger published lessons. 
If you decide to use a higher-quality bitrate than FM Bitrate, you should spend 
time experimenting with these options to see which selection sounds best. As 
a general rule, the FM Bitrate is more than adequate for audio that is played 
through typical computer speakers or headsets.
3. Calibrate the microphone.
click the Calibrate Input button
The Calibrate audio input dialog box opens. This is where you can set your 
microphone to its optimum recording level and sensitivity.
click the Auto calibrate button
speaking slowly and clearly, say 
I am setting my microphone recording level for use with 
Adobe Captivate. While calibrating, it is important that I speak as 
normally as possible. What I do not want to do is talk either too 
loudly or too softly.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

When the words Input Level OK appear beneath the meter at the right, you 
can stop speaking.
Note: The Pre-amplifier value that you see in the image above is 
probably not the same value that you get after the Auto calibration 
process is complete. The Pre-amplifier value varies widely from 
microphone manufacturer to microphone manufacturer. Generally 
speaking, the higher the Pre-amplifier value, the louder the recording 
volume. 
click each of the two OK buttons (one to close the Calibrate audio input 
dialog box and the other to close the Audio settings dialog box)
You should be back at the Slide Audio dialog box, ready to record your audio.

3. Record a narration.
from the Select Source area of the Add/Replace tab, ensure that 
Narration is selected
Note: There is also a System Audio option in the Select Source area. 
When you select this option, Captivate records the sounds your 
computer makes while you record. This is especially helpful if you are 
recording a process on your computer that results in an alert tone. 
Using System audio, both your narration and the alert tone are 
recorded.

Slide Audio
You’ve now learned that you can add audio to a slide object (page 140), add 
background audio to the entire project (page 142), and record your own audio 
(page 147). Now let’s import audio directly to a slide.
Student Activity: Import Audio Onto a Slide
1. Open the EditMyAudio project from the Captivate9Data folder.
This file is similar to the file you just closed, except it does not contain any 
slide audio or notes.
2. Import a prerecorded voice narration onto slide 2.
go to slide 2 and then choose Audio > Import to > Slide
from the Captivate9Data\audio folder, open EditMyAudio.wav
Because the audio file you are importing plays longer than the slide, the 
Audio Import Options dialog box opens. You have three options: make 
the slide timing match the length of the imported audio, force the audio to 
play over multiple slides, or split the audio equally among all of the slides 
in the project.
ensure Show the slide for the same amount of time as the length of 
the audio file is selected
click the OK button
You can confirm that audio has been added to the slide via the speaker icon 
that appears in the lower right of the slide thumbnail on the Filmstrip.

3. Preview the imported slide audio.
on the Filmstrip, click the audio icon on slide 2
choose Play
 
You should hear a bit of a problem with the imported slide audio. The narrator 
did not know the recording had begun, and you can hear a few gaffes and 
other background noises. To fix the problems, you can open the original audio 
file in an audio editing program (like Adobe Audition), edit and repair the 
issues, and then re-import the edited audio file into Captivate. Alternatively, 
you can use the audio editing features built within Captivate to edit the audio 
waveform without ever leaving Captivate. You will do that next.

© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Student Activity: Edit an Audio File
1. Ensure that the EditMyAudio project is still open and that you are on the 
second slide.
2. Edit an audio clip.
still working on slide 2, choose Audio > Edit > Slide
The Slide Audio dialog box opens. There are three tabs (Add/Replace, Edit, 
and Closed Captioning). You should be on the Edit tab.
3. Identify and select the problem areas of the waveform.
from the top, center of the dialog box, drag the zoom slider left to zoom 
away from the waveform
Your goal is to delete the parts of the waveform that are bad while leaving the 
good parts alone. The best way to proceed is to select a single segment of the 
waveform, listen to it, ensure it’s not something you want to keep, and then 
delete it.
starting at the far left of the waveform, drag right to select the first 
00:13 seconds of the audio (you can confirm you have selected 13 seconds 
worth of audio via the Selected area at the bottom right of the waveform)
click the Play/Pause button 
The selected 13 seconds of audio is junk and needs to be removed.
4. Delete the audio gaffe.
click the Delete button 
And just like that, the selected portion of the audio is gone.
click the Play/Pause button again 
 to hear the remaining audio
There are still some problem areas in the audio. However, with the first 13 
seconds deleted, the remaining audio is much better.
click the Save button and then click the Close button

Slide Audio Confidence Check
1. Edit the slide audio again. This time, delete the gaffe at 
the end of the waveform (the last few seconds where the 
narrator says she’s glad the recording is over).
There are a few more issues with this audio file, but you’ll 
fix those later.
2. Click the Save button.
3. Click the Close button.
4. Go to slide 3, and import the MoveMousePointer.wav audio to the slide. 
5. Preview the project to hear the audio you’ve added to the project. 
The background audio is too loud, making it difficult to hear the narrator on 
slides 2 and 3. You’ll fix that next.
6. Lower the background audio to something close to 5% (Audio > Edit > 
Background > Add/Replace tab).
7. Preview the project again. Hopefully, this time the background music won’t 
hinder the slide audio on slides 2 and 3. There are still a few issues with the 
slide audio, but you’ll fix those soon enough.
8. Choose Audio > Audio Management.
You can use the Audio Management dialog box to review the audio being used 
on every object on every slide, play the audio, and/or delete the audio.

9. Select Show object level audio (at the bottom left of the dialog box) to see 
a listing of every audio file used in the project.
10. Select any audio file you like and click the Export button at the bottom of the 
dialog box.
You can now specify a folder and export any audio file from your project. This 
is an especially useful feature if you have recorded audio files directly in 
Captivate, have edited them, and then need to use them in other programs.
11. Cancel the export.
12. Cancel the Advanced Audio Management dialog box.
13. Save and close the project.

Silence
If you come across audio gaffes between waves in your waveform, it may not 
always be appropriate to delete them. Sometimes deleting parts of a waveform 
shortens the segments between two waves and has a negative effect on the timing 
for the rest of the audio. In those instances, it’s a better idea to convert the gaffes 
into silence.
Student Activity: Insert Silence
1. Open SilenceMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Go to slide 2 and open the Slide Audio dialog box. (Audio > Edit > Slide)
3. Click at the beginning of the waveform and then click the Play/Pause button. 
When you get to the 3-second mark, you can hear some pretty bad feedback.
4. Insert Silence.
using your mouse, select the part of the waveform representing the 
feedback
at the top of the dialog box, click the Insert Silence command 
The audio feedback... gone! 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

Edit Audio Confidence Check
1. There is a sharp “clap” sound near the 11-second mark. 
Replace it with silence.
Now that you have replaced the “clap” sound with silence, 
return to where you earlier replaced the feedback noise 
with silence. There should be four full seconds of “dead 
air” near the 2-second mark on the waveform. 
2. Highlight and delete approximately two-thirds of the 
“dead air” (leave one second of “dead air” so you leave a 
comfortable pause between the waves).
3. Edit the rest of the waveform and remove the remaining “dead air” so that 
there isn’t more than one second of “dead air” between any segment.
4. Click the Save button, and click the Close button.
5. Preview the project.
6. When finished, save the project.

Module 8: Audio > Text-to-Speech > Convert Text-to-Speech
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
157
Text-to-Speech
Artificial voices have been around for years. In fact, there are many applications that 
allow you to select text and then have text-to-speech software convert the selected 
text into an audio file.
The problem with artificial voices used to be that the voices sounded artificial. 
Today’s text-to-speech technology has made huge strides. Although not perfect, the 
text-to-speech voices sound more natural than ever before.
Why consider text-to-speech over recorded audio? If you record the audio yourself, 
you should budget several hours to record the audio and then to clean it up (remove 
lip smacks, other unwanted sounds, and static). In spite of your best efforts, the 
audio files you create might still be considered less than adequate. And consider the 
fact that your voice changes over the day. If you need to replace a small segment of 
a waveform, you will find it challenging to match the audio levels without 
sophisticated and expensive audio equipment. By using text-to-speech, you can 
ensure that the audio levels and quality are always consistent. And text-to-speech 
never gets sick, never takes a vacation, and never asks for compensation.
Note: Before you can take full advantage of Captivate’s text-to-speech 
voices, you need to install the NeoSpeech software. If you have not yet 
installed NeoSpeech, choose Audio > Speech Management and click 
the link at the bottom of the dialog box. The link takes you to a 
download page on Adobe’s website.
Student Activity: Convert Text-to-Speech
1. Ensure that the SilenceMe project is still open.
2. Add Text-to-speech.
choose Audio > Speech Management
The Speech Management dialog box opens.
select the Slide 4 row
click Add Text-to-speech
type: This concludes the lesson. Click the images on this screen to 
visit our website, send us email, or get social with us.

3. Select a Speech Agent.
at the right of the Slide 4 row, select the current agent’s name
Note: Depending on your computer platform and the text-to-speech 
agents installed on your computer, you may see a name other than 
Bridget.
click the Speech Agent drop-down menu and choose any agent
Note: If you’ve installed NeoSpeech, Captivate comes with seven 
voices: Bridget, Chloe, James, Julie, Kate, Paul, and Yumi. Any other 
voices in your list were likely installed by some other application (or 
came with your computer). For instance, both Windows and the Mac OS 
include text-to-speech voices that serve as assistive devices for the 
visually impaired. The Macintosh comes with a bunch of voices including 
Hysterical and Zarvox (both are fun but not ideal Speech Agents). The 
NeoSpeech agents typically offer higher quality voices than those that 
ship standard on most computers.
click the Generate Audio button 
click the Close button
4. Preview the project.
When you get to slide 4, you hear your new text-to-speech audio narration.
5. Save and close the project.

TTS Confidence Check
1. Open the PhotoshopVignette project from the 
Captivate9Data folder. (You first worked with this 
project beginning on page 136.)
2. Preview the project.
3. Notice that there is background audio playing throughout 
the project.
4. Notice that there is voice-over audio on most of the slides. 
The voice-over was created using the text-to-speech 
feature that you just learned how to use.
5. Close the project (no need to save if prompted).
6. Open the AddAudioToMe project from the Captivate9Data folder.
7. This project is identical to the PhotoshopVignette project—except there isn’t 
any audio.
8. Import the BeethovenSymphony9.mp3 audio to the background. 
(Need help? See page 142.)
9. Display the Slide Notes panel (Window menu).
10. Most of the slides include Slide Notes. Using any Speech Agent you like, use 
the text-to-speech feature to convert the notes on each slide to audio. (Need 
help? See page 157.)
Note: Locate the TTS check box 
 in the Slide Notes panel on 
any slide. You can make quick work out of converting text to speech by 
clicking the TTS check box to select all of the notes on a slide. Do this 
for every slide throughout the project. After you’ve clicked the TTS 
check box, choose Audio > Speech Management. You can use this 
dialog box to quickly convert the slides notes to speech.
11. Save and close the project.

Video
You can add several types of video into a Captivate project, including AVI, MOV, and 
Flash Video (FLV or F4V). When importing the video, you can elect to import a file 
directly from your computer or from a web server, Flash Video Streaming Service, or 
Flash Media Server. 
Student Activity: Insert a Flash Video
1. Open AnimateMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Go to slide 1.
You will be adding a Flash Video to the left of the large logo.
3. Insert a Flash Video.
choose Media > Video
The Insert Video dialog box opens. You have two choices: Event Video 
(typically video that is expected to play on only one slide) and Multi-Slide 
Synchronized Video (video that is expected to play across multiple slides). 
Because the video you’ll be working with is expected to play on only the first 
slide, you’ll use Event Video.
select Event Video
from the Where is your video file? area, ensure that On your Computer 
is selected and then click the Browse button at the right
navigate to Captivate9Data\images_animation
open welcomeToLesson.flv
click the OK button
The video is imported, but it is so big it’s covering the slide. You will resize the 
video next.

Student Activity: Set Flash Video Properties
1. Ensure that the AnimateMe project is still open.
2. Change the size of the video so it fits on the slide.
with the video you just imported onto slide 1 selected, go to the 
Properties Inspector, Options tab
from the Transform area, ensure Constrain proportions is selected
change the W to 200 and then click in the H field
Thanks to Constrain proportions, the Height of the video automatically 
changes to 150.
3. Change the slide location of the video.
with the video still selected and still working on the Transform area, 
change the X to 152 and the Y to 128
Your slide 1 should look like the picture below.

4. Preview the Next 5 slides.
A box where the video should play appears, but the video does not play. 
In addition, before you know it, the next slide appears. You’ll fix both 
problems next.
5. Close the Preview.
6. Change the display timing and transition effect for the video.
with the video on slide 1 still selected, select the Timing Inspector
from the Display For drop-down menu, choose Rest of Slide
ensure that Pause slide till end of video is selected
The Pause slide till end of video option ensures that the first slide sticks 
around long enough for the video to play.
from the Transition drop-down menu, choose No Transition
Using Transitions is always optional. However, because they can cause partial 
fade in or fade out issues on slides with interactive objects (such as Buttons or 
Click Boxes), I tend to shy away from them unless they are adding value to 
the lesson.
7. Preview the Next 5 slides.
This time the box containing the video appears, but the slide does not move 
on to slide 2 on its own.

8. On the video’s Playbar, click the Play button to play the video.
A guide walks onto the screen, introduces the lesson, and then exits, stage 
right.
9. Close the Preview.
Next you will edit the Properties of the video to force the video to play on its 
own. You will also remove the video’s playbar.
10. Remove the video’s skin.
with the video on slide 1 still selected, go to the Properties Inspector 
and select the Style tab 
from the Skin drop-down menu, choose None

Animation
During the first activity in this module, you learned to import a video. But you can 
also import animations in either the Flash (SWF) or Animated GIF (GIF) format. 
If you have the time, software, and ability, you can create your own animations and 
import them into Captivate. You can also search the web for animations. However, if 
you go the web route, check for copyright restrictions on the animations you find. 
Captivate comes with several animations, which are in the SWF Animation folder 
(within the Captivate application Gallery folder).
Student Activity: Add Animation to a slide
1. Ensure that the AnimateMe project is still open.
2. Insert an animation.
go to slide 2
choose Media > Animation
You should automatically be browsing Captivate’s SWF Animation folder. 
If not, navigate there now (typically, this is within Adobe > Adobe Captivate 9 
> Gallery > SWF Animation).
open the Arrows folder
open the Blue Fade folder
open downright.swf
The animation shows up on your slide as a box containing the word 
“Animation.” 
Next, you will change the animation’s slide position and timing.
3. Save your work.

1. With the AnimateMe project still open, drag the Animation 
to the button at the right of the slide until the position of 
the Animation is similar to the image below.
2. Preview the Next 5 slides and notice that the timing of the animation on slide 
2 needs work. It would be better if the animation appears around the same 
time as the button (currently the animation appears right away, but the button 
does not appear until after 4 seconds). 
3. Using the Timing Inspector, change the Display For time for the animation to 
Rest of Slide.
4. Change the Appear After to 4 sec.
5. From the Transition area, change the Transition to No Transition.
6. Preview the Next 5 slides and notice that the timing of the animation is now 
better.

Text Animation
There are more than 90 Text Animations that come with Captivate. Although Text 
Animations are actually Flash objects, you don’t have to own Flash or know how to 
use it to work with Text Animations. Text Animations are typically used to bring text 
to life. And although they are cool, I would recommend you use Text Animations 
sparingly because they can quickly become a distraction.
Student Activity: Insert Text Animation
1. Ensure that the AnimateMe project is still open.
2. On slide 2, delete the Creating New Folders caption. (You’re about to insert 
a text animation in its place.)
3. Insert Text Animation.
still working on slide 2, choose Text > Text Animation
The Text Animation Properties dialog box appears.
replace the words Sample Text with Creating New Folders
change the Font to Verdana and the Size to 34

Demonstrations versus Simulations
The three most common types of eLearning lessons that developers create with 
Captivate are soft skills training, software demonstrations, and software simulations. 
At the beginning of this book, you learned how to create a soft skills lesson from 
scratch (page 24). You then learned how to record actions and create software 
demonstrations and interactive simulations (beginning on page 46).
For the bulk of this book, I have focused on creating and cleaning up 
demonstrations—projects that are intended to demonstrate actions taken on a 
computer. Although you added some interactivity to a project when you learned 
about buttons (page 32), the projects have not encouraged user interaction. 
Learners watching a demonstration would be expected to merely sit back and watch 
slide objects appear on the screen and watch the mouse move around the slide. 
Although there is nothing wrong with demonstrations, simulations can improve the 
learning experience by letting users actively participate in the lesson.
Most people who teach themselves Captivate create demonstrations. Why? The most 
common reasons I hear are (1) I didn’t know how to create a simulation and (2) I 
thought creating a simulation would be too hard. After this module, you will know 
how to quickly take an existing demonstration and convert it into a simulation. I’m 
hoping you will agree that simulations are not difficult to create.
Student Activity: Hide the Mouse
1. Open ConvertMeToSimulation from the Captivate9Data folder.
On the Filmstrip, notice that there is a mouse icon 
 in the lower right of 
slides 3 through 9. The mouse icon is a visual indicator that the mouse pointer 
is appearing on the slide. This demonstration project has been saved with a 
new name so that it can be converted into a simulation. One step to 
converting a demonstration into a simulation is to hide the mouse.
2. Hide the mouse for slides 3 through 9.
on the Filmstrip, select slides 3 through 9
Note: One way to select the range of slides is to select slide 3, press 
[Shift] on your keyboard, and then click one time on slide 9.

Find and Replace
Although you can use Captivate’s Find and Replace feature to find any object in your 
project (including images, animation, and Flash video), this feature is most useful for 
quickly replacing words or phrases throughout a project. During the following 
activity, you will use Captivate’s Find and Replace feature to replace phrases to 
make the lesson more action oriented.
Student Activity: Replace Phrases
1. Ensure that the ConvertMeToSimulation project is still open.
2. Go to slide 3.
Notice that the text in the Text Caption (Watch as the File menu is 
selected) as written does not encourage the learner to interact with the 
lesson. The learner is being encouraged to simply “watch” as something 
happens. You’ll use the Find and Replace feature to replace the phrase “Watch 
as” with “Select.”
3. Replace a phrase.
choose Edit > Find and Replace
The Find and Replace panel opens.
from the Search In drop-down menu, select Text Caption (if necessary)
from the Style drop-down menu, ensure that All Styles is selected 
in the Find field, type Watch as
in the Replace field, type Select
from the lower left of the panel select Match Case 
Ensure that you typed both entries exactly as written above and have matched 
the case.
click the Find Next button
The first caption containing the phrase you typed into the Find field is selected.

Click Boxes
Instead of telling and then showing a learner how to perform an action, you can 
insert Click Boxes that allow the learner to perform actions, such as clicking a menu 
or menu command. 
Student Activity: Insert a Click Box
1. Ensure that the ConvertMeToSimulation project is still open.
2. Preview the project.
There is an interactive button on the first slide. Clicking the button takes you 
to slide 2. From this point forward, there is no interactivity in the project.
3. Close the preview.
4. Insert a Click Box on slide 3.
go to slide 3
choose Interactions > Click Box
A new Click Box appears in the middle of your screen. The mouse badge on 
the lower right of the Click Box, although small, contains valuable information. 
If you look closely, you see a green icon on the top left side of the mouse 
badge indicating that the Click Box is activated with a left click. You can use 
the Click Box Properties to set the box to be right clickable by your learners, in 
which case the right side of the mouse badge is green.
5. Confirm the On Success action and Attempts settings for the Click Box.
double-click the newly inserted Click Box
on the Properties Inspector, select the Actions tab
from the On Success drop-down menu, ensure Go to the next slide is 
selected
Using this Action, the learner immediately is taken to slide 4 when the 
Click Box is clicked.
ensure that Infinite Attempts is selected

Using this option, a learner can click outside of the Click Box again and again. 
However, the Go to the next slide action does not occur until the learner 
successfully clicks the Click Box.
6. Add a Failure Caption to the Click Box.
still working on the Properties Inspector, Display area, select Failure 
A Failure caption appears on the slide along with the Click Box. This is what 
learners see when they click anywhere on the slide except the Click Box. 
Note: The Pause for Success/Failure Captions option you see in the 
Others area ensures that the learner is given a chance to read the 
Failure Caption before getting frustrated and clicking again in the wrong 
place. The Disable Click Sound option ensures that the learners don’t 
hear a double-click sound when they click the Click Box (their click and 
one created by the Click Box). And Pause project until user clicks 
ensures that the lesson does not continue unless the learner interacts 
with the Click Box.
7. Reposition the Click Box.
drag the Click Box up and to the left and resize it so that it covers the 
word “File” in the File menu on the slide background

Text Entry Boxes
You can use Text Entry Boxes to simulate areas in an application that require a user 
to type data. Learners can be instructed to type specific information into a Text Entry 
Box and, depending on what they type, captions can provide the appropriate 
feedback.
Student Activity: Insert a Text Entry Box
1. Open PasswordMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. On slide 1, notice that there is a Text Caption instructing the learner to enter a 
password to take the course. You will create a Text Entry Box that accepts a 
specific password.

Starting with PowerPoint
If you or an SME has already created a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint, 
don’t throw it away. You can import the presentation slides into an existing Captivate 
project or create a new project that uses the PowerPoint slides. During the import 
process, Captivate creates a link between the Captivate project and the original 
PowerPoint presentation. Using this workflow, most changes made to the original 
PowerPoint presentation can be reflected in the Captivate project. 
Note: Microsoft PowerPoint must be installed on your computer before 
you can import PowerPoint presentations into Captivate. Additionally, 
you should not work within PowerPoint while a presentation is being 
imported into Captivate.
Student Activity: Import a Presentation
1. Create a new project from a PowerPoint presentation.
choose File > New Project > Project From MS PowerPoint
The Open dialog box appears.
from the Captivate9Data folder, open S3_Policies.pptx
Note: If you are using an old version of PowerPoint (version 2003 or 
older), try to open S3_Policies. If you get an error message, open 
S3_Policies_For_PowerPoint2003AndOlder instead.
The Convert Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations dialog box opens, 
offering a few controls over the way the PowerPoint presentation will be 
imported into Captivate.
if the current Width and Height isn’t 800 x 600, click the Preset Sizes 
menu and choose 800 x 600
The presentation consists of only 10 slides. The slides contain hyperlinks 
created in PowerPoint that continue to work once the import process into 
Captivate is complete. Audio and transition settings are other popular 
PowerPoint features that import nicely into Captivate.

2. Set the PowerPoint to Captivate conversion options.
ensure that Selected slides: 10/10 appears at the bottom of the dialog 
box (if not, click the Select All button)
from the Advance Slide drop-down menu, ensure On mouse click is 
selected
The On mouse click option adds a large click box to each slide in the pending 
Captivate project. The other available option, Automatically, results in 
Captivate slides that continue from slide to slide after a delay of just a few 
seconds. Between the two options, On mouse click is the more common and 
results in a more interactive eLearning lesson in Captivate.
Windows users, select High Fidelity (the option is not available for Mac 
users)
During a standard import process, PowerPoint pptx presentations are first 
converted to the ppt format and then converted to SWF. If you select High 
Fidelity, the import process takes native pptx files directly to Captivate SWF 
(the ppt conversion is skipped). This option, which is available only in 
Captivate for Windows, results in the best-looking content in Captivate, but it 
could take a long time to import. (Five minutes or more in some cases.)
all users, ensure Linked is selected
Linked creates a link between the PowerPoint presentation and the new 
Captivate project. The link allows you to open the PowerPoint presentation 
from within Captivate. Additionally, any changes made externally to the 
PowerPoint presentation can be reflected in the Captivate project with a few 
simple mouse clicks.
click the OK button
When you change the size of the imported presentation to 800 x 600 (typically 
it’s the Mac users who need to do so), you’ll get an alert dialog box that’s 
concerned with the resolution of the resulting Captivate project. If you had 
changed the size of the project to something larger than the original, 
resolution might be negatively affected. In this instance, there isn’t anything 
to worry about, so you can click the Yes button.
After you click the OK button, the presentation is imported into Adobe 
Captivate and the PowerPoint slides are added to Captivate’s Filmstrip. 
Be patient. The import process can take several minutes (even if you hadn’t 
selected High Fidelity), and you will likely see PowerPoint start and possibly 
come to the front of the Captivate interface. 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

During my tests, it took just over five minutes and the dreaded “Not 
Responding” message appeared multiple times, both within the alert box and 
for Adobe Captivate itself. Although slow, the process completed every time. 
Once the presentation is imported, the Adding Microsoft PowerPoint Slides 
alert appears. This process completes relatively quickly. 
Once the import process completes, you will end up with a new 10-slide 
Captivate project (one Captivate slide for every PowerPoint slide).
3. Save the project to the Captivate9Data folder as S3_Policies_Integration.
4. Preview the project.
choose Preview > Project
Because a click box has been added to each of the Captivate slides during the 
import process, you will need to click your mouse once on each slide to move 
through the presentation. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve found that every aspect 
of PowerPoint that I’ve tested (hyperlinks, audio, transitions, and animations) 

Module 11: Working With PowerPoint > Starting with PowerPoint > Import a Presentation
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
191
continues to work as a Captivate project. I haven’t tested everything. If you 
happen upon a PowerPoint feature that does not work within Captivate, please 
let me know (email me at ksiegel@iconlogic.com).
5. Test the hyperlinks that were created in PowerPoint.
as you move through the presentation, click any of the links you see at the 
bottom of the slides
You should notice some peculiar behavior as you attempt to click the links. Did 
each click successfully take you to the websites indicated in the link? Or did 
your click take you to the next slide? Or maybe you experienced both 
behaviors as you moved from slide to slide.
What’s up with the often contradictory behavior? There is a large Click Box on 
each slide that covers the entire slide. The default timing for every Click Box is 
keeping the Click Box from being active on the slide for the first few seconds 
of playtime. During the preview, if you clicked the web link right away, you 
were taken online to the target of each link. If you were a bit slower, your click 
actually didn’t click the web link at all. Instead, your click was actually on the 
Click Box, which is so big that it is covering the web links on each slide. You’ll 
fix the problem next by resizing all of the click boxes in the project.
6. Close the preview (keep the S3_Policies_Integration project open).

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
192
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Student Activity: Apply Changes to All Items
1. Ensure that the S3_Policies_Integration project is still open.
2. Resize a single click box.
go to any slide in the project and double-click in the middle of the slide (not 
the thumbnail of the slide on the Filmstrip, but the slide itself)
Because the click box is as big as each slide (800 x 600), clicking the middle of 
the slide actually selects the click box, not the slide background.
on the Properties Inspector, select the Options tab
from the Transform area, remove the check mark from 
Constrain proportions
You’re about to change the height of the click box. If you hadn’t deselected 
Constrain proportions, changing the height of the click box would also 
inadvertently change the width of the click box.
change the H value from 600 to 550
The selected click box should now be short enough that it is no longer covering 
the link on the slide background. However, when you go to a different slide, 
you notice that none of the click boxes on any of the other slides have 
transformed.
3. Apply the new height to all of the click boxes in the project.
with the click box that you just transformed still selected return to the 
Transform area of the Properties Inspector
from the far right of the Transform area, click the menu and choose 
Apply to all items of this type
4. Go from slide to slide and check the click boxes throughout the project.
Thanks to Apply to all items of this type, every click box in the project has 
resized to 550 pixels. The hyperlinks at the bottom of each slide are now 
accessible when you preview the project. 

Module 11: Working With PowerPoint > Starting with PowerPoint > Edit the Presentation
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
193
Student Activity: Edit the Presentation
1. Ensure that the S3_Policies_Integration Captivate project is still open.
2. Edit the slides with PowerPoint.
choose Edit > Edit with Microsoft PowerPoint > Edit Presentation
The Captivate slides that originated in PowerPoint open in the original 
PowerPoint presentation. If you’ve used PowerPoint before, you recognize the 
familiar PowerPoint interface. However, if you are using Windows, there are 
two buttons you wouldn’t normally see in PowerPoint: the Save and Cancel 
buttons at the upper left of the window. (Although the Save and Cancel 
buttons do not exist for Mac users, the editing process works just fine.)
go to slide 2 of the PowerPoint presentation
at the right of slide 2, delete the words “for file collaboration, shared access 
and website management” and replace them with in the world. (The text 
should now read: To continually develop the finest file management 
software in the world.)
3. Save the PowerPoint changes and update the Captivate project.
Windows users, click the Save button in the upper left of the window; 
Mac users, quit PowerPoint (save when prompted)
Windows users, the changes you just made to the PowerPoint presentation are 
saved, the PowerPoint presentation is closed, and the Captivate slides are 
automatically updated in Captivate. Mac users, you are prompted to import 
the updated presentation (which you should allow by clicking the Yes button).
4. Preview the Captivate project.
You can now click any of the links on the bottom of any of the slides. In 
addition, the edit made to the second slide in PowerPoint has made its way 
into the Captivate project.
5. Close the preview (keep the project open).

Apply to All Confidence Check
As mentioned earlier, there is a large click box on every 
Captivate slide (thanks to the On Mouse Click option you 
selected during the import process you went through on 
page 188). The click boxes are great because they keep the 
lesson from moving forward until the learner clicks the click box. 
However, the click box includes what is often considered an 
annoying click sound. You’ll remove that next.
1. Double-click the middle of any slide to select the slide’s 
click box.
2. From the Actions tab on the Properties Inspector, Others area, select 
Disable Click Sound.
3. Use the menu at the right of the Display area to apply your change to all 
items of this type.
4. Save your work.
5. Preview the project and notice that the click sound has been removed.
6. Close the preview (keep the project open).

PowerPoint Collaboration
You have just learned that as a Captivate developer, you can import a PowerPoint 
presentation and, thanks to the Link feature, initiate changes to the PowerPoint 
presentation from within Captivate. Nice! But let’s assume that you’ve imported the 
presentation from a network drive. An SME has made changes to the original 
PowerPoint presentation but has neglected to tell you. If the source PowerPoint 
presentation is updated, you are able to see that the Captivate project is no longer 
synchronized with the PowerPoint presentation via the Library, and you can grab the 
updates. 
Student Activity: Synchronize With Source
1. Minimize (Hide) Captivate, and open the S3_Policies presentation directly in 
PowerPoint.
2. Edit the slides with PowerPoint.
using PowerPoint, open the S3_Policies presentation (the presentation is 
in the Captivate9Data folder)
Note: If you used the S3_Policies_For_PowerPoint2003AndOlder 
PowerPoint presentation when you started this module, open it now 
instead of S3_Polcies.
go to slide 3
at the top of the Alcohol text box, add the phrase Alcohol is in front of the 
phrase Not permitted and then lowercase the “n” in Not
3. Save the presentation and exit (quit) PowerPoint.
4. Return to Captivate. (The S3_Policies_Integration project should still be 
open.)
5. Go to slide 3 of the Captivate project. 
Notice that the edits made externally to the PowerPoint presentation do not 
appear on the slide. You’ll update the Captivate project with the changes you 
made in the PowerPoint presentation next.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
196
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
6. Open the Library.
at the far right of the Captivate window, click Library
On the Library, notice that there is a Status column (you may need to resize 
the Library to see the Status column). The red button indicates that the 
S3_Policies presentation within the Captivate project is no longer synchronized 
with the PowerPoint presentation. (The changes you just made to the 
presentation have not yet been reflected in the Captivate project.)
7. Synchronize with source.
click the Red button
The edited PowerPoint slides are updated in the Captivate project. On the 
Library, the color of the button in the Status column changes from red to 
green.
Note: Be patient as the update process progresses. Depending on the 
speed of your computer, the process could take a few moments.
go to slide 3 of the Captivate project
Notice that the edits you made in the PowerPoint presentation appear on the 
Captivate slide.
8. Save your work.
Note: If you no longer want the PowerPoint presentation in your 
project to be linked to the original PowerPoint presentation, you can 
embed the presentation in your project. On the Library, right-click the 
presentation and choose Change to Embedded. Once embedded, the 
size of your Captivate project increases significantly and you are no 
longer able to receive updates from the original PowerPoint 
presentation. If you change your mind, you can restore the link to the 
original presentation by right-clicking the presentation on the Library 
and choosing Change to Linked.

Rescaling Projects
If your project was recorded at a specific size and you now need it to be bigger or 
smaller, you can use Captivate’s Rescale project command to quickly resize it—a 
real time saver over having to rerecord the entire lesson. When you rescale the 
project, you can instruct Captivate to ensure that the project’s captions are rescaled 
if the resized project is smaller than the original.
Note: You will not be able to use the Undo command to undo a rescale. 
Also, if you rescale a project, you could degrade the visual quality of the 
project.
Student Activity: Rescale a Project
1. Ensure that the S3_Policies_Integration project is still open.
2. Rename the project.
choose File > Save As, change the name to 
S3_Policies_Integration_Resized, and save it to the Captivate9Data 
folder
3. Rescale a project larger.
choose Modify > Rescale project
The Rescale Project dialog box appears.
in the Size area, ensure that Maintain Aspect Ratio is selected
change the Width to 1200 and press [tab]
Once you leave the Width field, the Height should automatically become 900 
(thanks to the Maintain Aspect Ratio option).
from the If new size is larger area, select Rescale Project to Fit New 
Size (if necessary)
ensure that Rescale all Objects is selected

Although just about everything in the project comes directly from the 
PowerPoint presentation, there are click boxes on every slide. Thanks to the 
Rescale options, each of those click boxes is going to resize proportionally to 
the new size of the project.
click the Finish button
A warning appears. As mentioned earlier, you cannot undo this step. However, 
if you are not satisfied with the results, you can close the project without 
saving.
click the OK button
The project’s slides are now much larger.
Rescaling Confidence Check
1. Preview the project.
2. As you move from slide to slide, notice that the quality of 
the slides is actually quite good (astonishing, considering 
that you rescaled the project to make it significantly 
larger).
Note: Although the quality of the rescale worked with this 
particular project, keep in mind that rescaling can lead to 
a loss of image quality. 
3. Close the preview.
4. Close the project (there is no need to save it).

Quiz Setup
You will soon be adding a few question slides to an existing Captivate project. Before 
proceeding, it’s a good idea to set up a few things that will make the process of 
creating a quiz a bit more efficient. For instance, if you set up the Object Styles for 
the Quiz objects, the question slides will look consistent throughout the project. In 
addition, you should set some basic Quiz Preferences to control such things as 
general quiz navigation and the Pass/Fail options.
Student Activity: Edit Quizzing Object Styles
1. Open QuizMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Use the Object Style Manager to set the formatting for Quizzing Objects.
choose Edit > Object Style Manager
at the upper left of the Object Style Manager dialog box, expand the 
Quizzing Objects
expand the Captions
from the list of captions, select Correct Caption 
at the right side of the dialog box, from the Text Format area, change the 
Family to Trebuchet MS
3. Review some of the other Quizzing Object styles.
from the Quizzing Objects area, select any of the remaining objects
spend a few minutes observing the Caption Type, Text Format, and 
Transition settings for the styles
The project is using a Theme and the settings, along with the formatting of 
some of the slides, are based on that Theme.

After a learner answers a question in the quiz, the learner needs to be diligent 
about clicking the slide’s Submit button before going to the next question. 
Failure to click the Submit button means that Captivate treats the answer as 
incorrect, even if the learner selects the correct answer. To prevent learners 
from accidentally failing to click the Submit button and causing a lot of 
heartache along the way, Captivate displays a Submit All button on each

Question Slide instead of a Submit button. If the learner answers a question 
and clicks Next (without clicking Submit All), Captivate allows the learner to go 
to the next question. However, on the last question, if the learner clicks Next, 
an alert dialog box opens that encourages the learner to Submit All answers.
The Show Progress option inserts a counter on each Question slide so that 
learners know where they are in the quiz. 
Allow Backward Movement allows learners to go backward through the 
quiz. 
When you select Show score at the End of the Quiz, Captivate adds an 
additional slide to the project that summarizes how learners score on the quiz. 
The Allow User to Review the Quiz option allows learners to go back and 
see how they answered the questions. However, once the answers are 
submitted for scoring, learners are not able to change their answers.
Note: I didn’t cover all of the options in the Quiz Settings dialog box. 
You can learn about the other options by clicking the Help link at the 
bottom of the dialog box. You will typically find a Help link in most of 
Captivate’s dialog boxes.
3. Set the Pass or Fail options for the Quiz.
from the Quiz category at the left of the dialog box, select Pass or Fail 
from the Pass/Fail Options area, change the % or more of total points to 
pass to 50
Learners need to correctly answer half of the questions to pass the quiz.

4. Set the Passing and Failing Grade action.
from the Action drop-down menu for both If Passing Grade and 
If Failing Grade, choose Go to the next slide
By setting both Actions to Go to the next slide, it doesn’t matter how 
learners do on the quiz, they’ll end up on next slide on the Filmstrip. You 
could, however, take learners to a specific slide (or website) should they pass; 
another should they fail.
click the OK button
There should be a new slide in the project: Quiz Results. The slide was created 
because you selected Show score at the End of the Quiz. 
5. Reposition the Results slide.
on the Filmstrip, drag the Quiz Results slide down and after the last slide

Question Slides
Captivate allows you to add nine different types of Question Slides: Multiple Choice, 
True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Short Answer, Matching, Hot Spot, Sequence, Rating 
Scale (Likert), and Random Question. All of the Question Slides can be graded (worth 
a specific number of points) except for Rating Scale (Likert), which is typically used 
for surveys.
Ideally, any eLearning quizzes you create will be short... no more than 5-10 
questions. A quiz longer than that is too long and makes your eLearning lesson all 
about the quiz instead of transferring knowledge from the lesson to your learner.
Student Activity: Insert Question Slides
1. Ensure that the QuizMe project is still open.
2. Insert a Multiple Choice and True/False Question slide.
select slide 10
choose Quiz > Question slide
The Insert Questions dialog box appears. If you click the Help link in the lower 
left of the dialog box, you can read more information about the available 
question types.

Knowledge Checks
During this module you learned how to insert graded questions. You can also add 
Pretest questions (questions with right and wrong answers that can be worth points 
but are not graded along with regular question slides), and Knowledge Checks.
Once added to a project, Knowledge Check slides behave like any other question 
slide with a few notable exceptions. As mentioned above, Pretest questions can be 
worth points; Knowledge Check questions cannot. 
In the image on the left below, notice the Actions tab (on the Properties Inspector) 
for a Pretest question. There are very Actions. In the second image, compare the 
Actions for a Knowledge Check slide. Simply put, there's more opportunity for you as 
a developer to ensure your learner is grasping a concept with a Knowledge Check 
slide than with a Pretest slide.

URL Actions
You learned how to use Click Boxes on page 179 to add interactivity to your projects. 
But you can use Click Boxes for other purposes. For instance, a Click Box can be used 
to link an area of a slide to a website or other remote file or to create an email link. 
And you can use Click Boxes to create links between projects. You’ll learn how to 
create a link to a website next.
Student Activity: Create a Link to a Website
1. Open FinishMe from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Insert a Click Box.
go to slide 4
There is a picture of the Super Simplistic Solutions home page on the slide. 
You are going to attach a URL to a Click Box that opens the SSS home page in 
a web browser.
choose Interactions > Click Box
A Click Box and three captions are added to the slide.
3. Set the On Success action for the Click Box to open a web page.
with the newly inserted Click Box selected, select the Actions tab on the 
Properties Inspector
from the On Success drop-down menu, choose Open URL or file
 in the URL field, type http://www.supersimplisticsolutions.com
4. Force the browser window to appear in a new window and stop the lesson 
from continuing to play while the learner is on the external web page.
click the drop-down menu to the right of the URL that you just typed

Module 13: Finishing Touches > URL Actions > Create a Link to a Website
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
213
choose New
This option forces the link into a new browser window instead of replacing your 
lesson with the website.
deselect Continue Playing the Project
With this option deselected, there is no chance that the eLearning lesson 
moves on without the learner (until the learner returns to the lesson).
5. Remove the Click Box captions and set other options.
still working on the Actions tab of the Properties Inspector, from the 
Display area deselect Success, Failure, and Hint
The Click Box you added is not something that must be clicked by the learner, 
so there is no need to include the feedback captions.
from the Others area, select Hand Cursor
By enabling this option, learners who use the Click Box see a Hand Cursor, a 
universal sign that the Click Box area is interactive.
ensure that the only other selected option is Pause project until 
user clicks
Without this option, the lesson would end before the learner had a chance to 
interact with the Click Box.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Skins > Apply a Skin
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
215
Skins
Skins perform much the same function for a project as your clothes perform for you. 
Bored? Bummed? Perhaps something simple like changing your clothes would be 
enough to change your attitude. Consider some of the top websites in the world. 
During the holiday season, sites like amazon.com and google.com change the whole 
attitude of their site just by changing the “skin” used on their sites to reflect the 
season. The sites themselves don’t change; just the outer skin changes.
You are about to learn how easy it is to change the skin used by your project. And 
you will learn that Skins can be customized to suit your taste—you can select from 
several playbars, buttons, and color schemes. 
Student Activity: Apply a Skin
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Preview the project and notice that there is a playbar at the bottom of the 
lesson window. The playbar is just one component of a Skin.
3. Close the preview.
4. Apply a skin to the project.
choose Project > Skin Editor
from the top of the Skin Editor, select the Playback Control button
from the Skin drop-down menu, choose Pearls
5. Preview the Project. 
Notice the Pearls skin has been applied to the lesson.
6. Close the preview.

Student Activity: Edit, Save, and Delete a Skin
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Remove an unnecessary control from the playbar.
with the Skin Editor still open (Project or Window menu), ensure Pearls is 
selected from the Skin drop-down menu
from the lower left of the Skin Editor window, remove the check mark from 
Closed Captioning
Because this project does not have any closed captions, the Closed Captioning 
option is not needed. (Closed Captions are important; they are covered in 
Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond the Essentials.)
3. Save the modifications to the skin as a new skin.
click the Save As button
The Save As dialog box opens.
change the name to Pearls_NoCC

219
Table of Contents
You can create a Table of Contents (TOC) that serves as a navigation aid for your 
learners. Creating the TOC is as simple as selecting Show TOC on the TOC tab of the 
Skin Editor. A TOC typically appears at the right or left of the lesson, making the 
lesson wider by a minimum of 250 pixels (something to consider if your lesson is 
already pretty wide).
Student Activity: Create a TOC
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Create a TOC.
choose Project > Table of Contents
The Skin Editor opens again, but this time you are on the Table of Contents 
section.
from the left side of the Skin Editor, select Show TOC
By selecting Show TOC, an empty TOC has been added to the left of the 
lesson. Next you will add the four slides in the lesson to the TOC.
add check marks to all four slides
3. Change the slide titles used on the TOC.

Preloaders
If your learner is using a slow Internet connection and your lesson is large (over 10-
15 megabytes), it could take a significant amount of time for the lesson to begin 
playing on the learner’s computer or mobile device. Because most people do not wait 
for more than a few seconds for something to happen on their device before giving 
up, a loading screen—an image or message that appears during those first seconds 
while the initial part of the published lesson is downloading—is critical.
Student Activity: Check Publish Settings and Add a 
Loading Screen
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Confirm the Publish Settings.
choose File > Publish Settings
ensure that your Settings match the picture below (all are Captivate 
defaults)
Most of the Publish Settings are self-explanatory. However, I’ll explain some of 
the more important options below. (If you want to know more about the 
options, click the Help link at the bottom of the dialog box.) 
Frames Per Second is a measure of how smoothly your published lesson 
plays. Remember when you were a kid and you made your very own cartoon 
by drawing a simple stick figure on several pieces of paper? The more pieces 
of paper you had and the more poses you added to your cartoon character, 
the more realistic the cartoon looked when you fanned through all of the 
pieces of paper. The same idea holds true with Frames Per Second. The more 
frames you have, the smoother your lesson will be. The Captivate default is 30 

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Preloaders > Check Publish Settings and Add a Loading Screen
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
223
Frames Per Second, which is plenty. I don’t suggest lowering or raising the 
Frames Per Second unless you are specifically instructed to do so by someone 
on your team who’s in the know. (I’ve never changed the Frames Per Second 
in any of my projects.)
Externalize Resources. One goal when publishing your content is to keep 
the number of published files to a minimum, making file management and 
uploads to web servers easy. By default, resources such as Skins and 
Animations are embedded within the published lesson file, resulting in a larger 
SWF. Unless your SWFs are huge, consider leaving the options as shown on 
the previous page.
3. Add a loading screen.
from the Project category at the left, select Start and End
ensure Auto Play is selected from the Project Start options area
With Auto Play selected, the lesson begins playing as soon as it is downloaded 
by your learner.
select Preloader
click the Browse button to the right of Preloader
You should automatically be browsing the Preloaders folder that comes 
with Captivate (if not, you can manually browse to the folder via 
Gallery\Preloaders). The Preloader is what the learners see while they are 
waiting for the lesson to begin playing.
from the Preloaders folder, open default loading.gif
4. Set a Preloader %.
change the Preloader % to 50
The Preloader % is the percentage of the published Captivate SWF file 
that must be downloaded to the learner’s device before the lesson begins to 
play. Setting the percentage to 50 percent is pretty standard. I wouldn’t 
suggest going too low (which results in a sputtering playback) or too high 
(which takes too long for the lesson to begin).
5. Set the project fade options.
if necessary, select Fade In on the First slide
from the Action drop-down menu in the Project End Options area, 
ensure Stop project is selected 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
224
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
if necessary, deselect Fade Out on the Last slide
Fading in on the first slide is a nice effect. However, I’ve discovered that 
fading out on the last slide doesn’t offer nearly the same impact. In fact, if you 
leave it selected, you may find that it causes other problems with items on 
your Timeline that also fade in and/or fade out with objects that pause the 
slide action. As for the Actions area, I prefer the Stop Project action. When the 
lesson is finished, it will stop. The learner can then elect to rewind the lesson 
or close the lesson.
click the OK button
6. Save your work.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Publishing > Publish as SWF and PDF
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
225
Publishing
Publishing in Captivate takes your source content and outputs it into a format that 
can be consumed (viewed) by the learner. Currently, the most common way to 
publish a Captivate project is as a Flash SWF, an excellent solution because SWF files 
can be used by the vast majority of the world’s personal computers, browsers, and 
operating systems. Your learners do not need Captivate installed on their computer 
to use an SWF, but they do need a modern web browser and the free Adobe Flash 
Player (www.adobe.com). According to Adobe, the Flash Player is installed on the 
majority of the world’s computers.
Of course, SWFs have a problem. Learners using an Apple mobile device, such as the 
iPad, iPod, and iPhone (that’s millions upon millions of potential learners), cannot use 
SWF content. Learners using an Apple mobile device who attempt to use an SWF are 
met with a warning that SWFs are not supported. If you’d like to create content for 
the Apple mobile devices, all hope is not lost. As an alternative to publishing SWFs, 
you can publish your content as HTML5. Lessons published as HTML5 play on any 
computer or mobile device that supports HTML5, including the Apple mobile devices.
If neither SWF nor HTML5 works for you, you can also publish a PDF. However, 
because PDFs include Flash content, they are not appropriate for devices that do not 
support Flash (such as the Apple iPad).
Note: Although most features you can add to a Captivate project work 
when published as HTML5, not all features are supported (such as 
Rollover Captions and Rollover Images). Prior to publishing as HTML5, 
you’ll use the HTML5 Tracker to flag features that are not supported.
Student Activity: Publish as SWF and PDF
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Specify a Publish format and Project Title.
choose File > Publish
The Publish dialog box opens.
from Publish as drop-down menu, ensure HTML5/SWF is selected
confirm that the Project Title is MouseSkills
The Project Title ends up being the physical name of the files you publish. 
Because your published files are likely to be stored on a web server, never use 
spaces in Project Titles.
3. Select a Location for the published assets.
at the right of the Location field, click the yellow browse folder
navigate to Captivate9Data folder

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
226
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
open the published_projects folder
from beneath the Location area, select Publish To Folder
The Publish to Folder option creates a folder inside the published_projects 
folder called MouseSkills. There will be occasions when you do not want to 
create a new folder when publishing—a decision you make on a project-by-
project basis. 
You would typically select Zip Files only if you intend to upload your project to 
an Learning Management System. (Refer to Adobe Captivate 9: Beyond the 
Essentials for more information.) The Fullscreen option causes your published 
lesson to take over the learner’s entire screen; something that most learners 
do not appreciate.
4. Select the Output Format.
from the Output Format area, select SWF
The SWF button highlights, indicating it is your selected publish format. The 
HTML5 should be white. Although you can publish both SWF and HTML5 at the 
same time, you’ll be publishing them separately and then reviewing the files 
that are physically published. 
5. Export a PDF and select the Flash Player Version.
from the Output Format area, select Export PDF
The PDF you create includes all of the lesson’s animations, audio, and 
interactivity. Any learner who has Adobe Reader 9 or newer and the latest 
Adobe Flash Player can consume your content.
from the Flash Player Version drop-down menu, select Flash Player 10
At the time that this book was written, Flash Player 11 was the newest version 
of the Flash Player. However, if you select a Flash Player version that’s too 
new, learners who have an older version of the Flash Player would be unable 
to watch your published lesson. By selecting Flash Player 10, or even 10.2, 
which is more widely used than version 11, it’s likely that most learners will be 
able to view your content.
ensure Force re-publish on all slides is selected
With Force re-publish on all slides, Captivate refreshes the entire published 
assets every time you publish a lesson. When you deselect this option, the 
publish process is quicker. However, every once in a while edited slides do not 
appear edited in the published version of the lesson.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Publishing > Publish as SWF and PDF
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
227
deselect the other Output options if necessary
6. Publish the lesson.
click the Publish button 
Because you selected Export PDF, you are presented with an alert dialog box 
letting you know that learners need the free Adobe Reader 9 or newer to work 
with the Flash content within the PDF.
click the OK button
Next you are prompted to view the output.
click the No button (you’ll be previewing both the SWF and the PDF 
published content in just a moment)
7. Review the assets published to the Publish folder.
minimize (Hide) Captivate and navigate to 
Captivate9Data\published_projects
open the MouseSkills folder
The Publish process has yielded a handful of files. 
There’s an SWF, an HTML file, and a PDF. The SWF contains the lesson, and 
it’s the file learners will be interacting with via a web browser. There is also a 
JavaScript file (standard.js) and a CSS file (captivate.css). The role of the JS 

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
228
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
and CSS files is to ensure that the SWF appears and plays without being 
blocked by the web browser. And the HTML file is the start page for the 
lesson. Once the HTML file is opened by a web browser, code within the HTML 
page loads into the browser and immediately looks for the JavaScript and CSS 
files. Assuming the files are located, more data is added into the HTML page 
that instructs the SWF file to play within the web browser. The SWF, HTML, JS, 
and CSS files should always be kept together. Lose any one of the files, and 
the lesson will not play. The PDF is a standalone asset that needs Adobe 
Reader and Adobe Flash Player.
8. View the published SWF.
from within the MouseSkills folder, open MouseSkills.htm
The HTML file loads the SWF into your default web browser, and the lesson 
opens. Keep in mind that learners who attempt to work with an SWF must be

9. View the published PDF.
from within the MouseSkills folder, open MouseSkills.pdf
The lesson opens just as it did when you opened the HTML file. However, 
this version of the lesson is running within Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat 
(depending upon what is installed on your computer). The lesson isn’t using 
a web browser but includes all of the rich media (audio, interactivity, and 
music).
10. Close the PDF and return to the Captivate project.

Student Activity: Run the HTML5 Tracker
1. Ensure that the FinishMe project is still open.
2. Test the lesson to see if it is appropriate for HTML5.
choose Project > HTML5 Tracker
Although this lesson works great on a device that supports Flash (SWFs), 
HTML5 has limitations. The FinishMe lesson uses Rollover Captions on slides 2, 
3, and 4 (you learned how to add Rollover Captions on page 128). For a 
Rollover Caption to be successful, the learner must use a mouse or touch-pad 
to literally rollover the Rollover Area. Rollovers on a mobile device aren’t just 
problematic... they’re impossible. Although a select few mobile devices can 
detect movement from a distance, the only way for most mobile users to 
interact with Rollovers on most devices is to touch the Rollover Area.
Although you could go through and remove the Rollover Captions (possibly 
replace them with something else) to save time, you will close the project and 
open another project better suited to be published as HTML5.
3. Close the HTML5 Tracker window.
4. Save and close the FinishMe project.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Publishing > Publish as HTML5
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
231
Student Activity: Publish as HTML5
1. Open HTML5Me from the Captivate9Data folder.
2. Preview the project.
This project contains plenty of audio and interactivity. Unlike the last project, 
it does not contain any Rollover Captions.
3. Test the lesson to see if it is appropriate for HTML5.
close the Preview and then choose Project > HTML5 Tracker
This time the results couldn’t be better. According to the tracker, you now 
have a green light to publish the lesson as HTML5.
close the HTML5 Tracker window
4. Specify a Publish format.
choose File > Publish
The Publish dialog box opens.
from the Publish as drop-down menu, ensure HTML5/SWF is still 
selected
change the Title to CreateNewFolder_HTML5
5. Select a Location for the published assets.
at the right of the Location area, click the yellow browse folder
navigate to Captivate9Data folder
open the published_projects folder and then click the Select Folder 
button (Choose on the Mac) 
6. Select HTML5 as the Output Format.
from the Output Format area, deselect SWF and select HTML5

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials

7. Publish the HTML5 output.
click the Publish button 
Once the Publish process completes, you are prompted to view the output.
click the No button (you’ll be viewing the content in just a moment)
8. Review the HTML5 published assets.
minimize (Hide) Captivate
navigate to Captivate9Data\published_projects and open the 
CreateNewFolder_HTML5 folder
There are far more assets with the HTML5 output than what resulted from 
publishing as a SWF. These assets are dependent on each other so everything 
must be kept together when posted to a web server.
open index with your web browser to view the lesson
The lesson plays as expected... it’s even interactive. And because it’s HTML5, 
it will work as it does now when opened with a mobile devices, such as the 
Apple iPad or Kindle Fire.
9. Close the browser.
10. Return to the HTML5Me Captivate project.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Publishing > Publishing Confidence Check

233
Publishing Confidence Check
1. Ensure that the HTML5Me project is still open.
You have learned how to publish projects as SWF (for 
desktop users) and HTML5 (for mobile users). But which 
publish format should you ultimately choose? If you 
publish SWF and then HTML5 separately, you’ll have to 
provide two published lessons for your learners... and 
require learners to choose the best format. 
Wouldn’t it be great if could publish a project as both SWF 
and HTML5, at one time, and let the learner’s device (not the learner) ask for 
the appropriate format based on its capabilities? Sure it would... let’s do it.
2. Open the Publish dialog box.
3. Change the Title to CreateNewFolder_SWF_HTML5.
4. From the Output Format area, select both SWF and HTML5 (enable both 
options).
5. Publish the project (when the Publish process is complete, there’s no need to 
view the Output).
6. Minimize (Hide) Captivate.
7. Navigate to Captivate9Data\published_projects and open the 
CreateNewFolder_SWF_HTML5 folder.
8. The folder contains a combination of the SWF and HTML5 output files. But 
there’s a new player: multiscreen.html. 
If you make this file the link for learners to click when accessing the lesson, 
desktop users who have Flash will automatically be served the SWF version of 
the lesson. Learners who are using devices that do not support Flash will 
automatically be served the HTML5 version of the lesson. How awesome is 
that?
9. Return to Captivate.
10. Reopen the Publish dialog box.
11. From the Publish as drop-down menu, choose Video.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
234
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
12. Change the Title to CreateNewFolder_HTML5 and set the publish Location 
to Captivate9Data\published_projects.
13. Publish the project.
The Adobe Captivate Video Publisher opens and generates a video.
14. When prompted, Open the Published Video.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Publishing > Publishing Confidence Check
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
235
The MP4 video will open on just about any device (including desktops, laptops, 
and mobile devices) and can be uploaded to video services such as YouTube. 
However, because this is a video, there’s no interactivity possible. Throughout 
the short video, you are prompted to click on the screen, but you aren’t able 
to comply. Keep the no-interactivity issue in mind when developing your 
eLearning lessons. Although videos are perfectly fine, they may not meet your 
training needs.
15. Close the video and the Adobe Captivate Video Publisher.
16. Choose File > Print.
The Print dialog box is a bit misleading. You can’t actually print your Captivate 
slides from here. However, you can Publish your project as a Microsoft Word 
document and then print from Word. 
17. Ensure that the Export range is set to All.
18. From the Type drop-down menu, choose Handouts.

Adobe Captivate 9: The Essentials
236
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
19. From the Handout Layout Options area, deselect Use table in the output.
20. Select Caption Text.
21. Select Add blank line for notes.
22. Select Include objects and questions
The four remaining options should be deselected.
23. Publish the document and View the Output.
The handout opens in Microsoft Word. Similar to PowerPoint, the document 
can be printed and serve as support material for your lesson.
24. Close the Word document and return to Captivate.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Round Tripping > Export Captions to Microsoft Word
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
237
Round Tripping
Exporting captions to Microsoft Word is one of my favorite Captivate features. Why? 
If you export the captions to Word, any team member can open the exported 
document with Word and make editorial changes. Those changes can be imported 
into Captivate—something I call Round Tripping.
You can use this round trip workflow to create multiple-language versions of your 
project without having to rerecord or re-create the project. All you have to do is send 
the exported captions to an interpreter and have the caption text translated into 
another language. You would then import the translated captions into your project. 
Cool!
Student Activity: Export Captions to Microsoft Word
1. Ensure that the HTML5Me project is still open.
2. Export the project captions.
choose File > Export > Project Captions and Closed Captions
The Save As dialog box opens.
ensure that you are saving to the Captivate9Data folder as HMTL5Me 
Captions
click the Save button
You are notified when the captions have been exported.
click the Yes button to open the Word document
The captions have been imported into a Word table. There are five columns 
with the following headers: Slide Id, Item Id, Original Text Caption Data, 
Updated Text Caption Data, and Slide. You can make any changes you 
want to the Updated Text Caption Data, but you must not change any of the

other information. The slide ID identifies to which slide your edited captions 
go. The Item ID identifies which caption goes with which caption data.
3. Update the Word content.
on slide ID 1170, Item ID 1191, find the phrase During this lesson you 
will have a chance... in the Updated Text Caption Data column
change the text to During this interactive lesson you will learn how to 
create a new folder.
4. Save the Word document and close Microsoft Word.
5. Return to the Captivate project.

Module 13: Finishing Touches > Round Tripping > Perform a Round Trip
© 2015, IconLogic, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
239
Student Activity: Perform a Round Trip
1. Ensure that the HTML5Me project is still open.
2. Import the edited caption into the Captivate project.
choose File > Import > Project Captions and Closed Captions
The Open dialog box appears.
open HTML5Me Captions from the Captivate9Data folder
You will be notified that the items were imported into the project.
click the OK button
3. Review the updated caption.
go to slide 2
Notice that the text you changed in the Word document has been updated on 
the slide. How awesome is that?
4. Save your work and close the project.
And a hearty congratulations are in order... you have completed this book. 
There’s much more to Captivate of course (see the next page), but you should 
now feel comfortable creating new projects and recording screen actions. You 
should be able to add standard objects such as click boxes, buttons, text entry 
boxes, images, characters, videos, and animations. And you should feel 
comfortable in your ability to not only Publish your content but create output 
files appropriate for the kind of device you expect your learners to be using.
