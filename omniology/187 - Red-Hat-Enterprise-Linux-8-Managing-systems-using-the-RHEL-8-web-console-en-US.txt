The RHEL web console uses the same system APIs as you would in a terminal, and actions performed in
a terminal are immediately reflected in the RHEL web console.
You can monitor the logs of systems in the network environment, as well as their performance, displayed
as graphs. In addition, you can change the settings directly in the web console or through the terminal.
1.2. INSTALLING AND ENABLING THE WEB CONSOLE
To access the RHEL 8 web console, first enable the cockpit.socket service.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 includes the RHEL 8 web console installed by default in many installation
variants. If this is not the case on your system, install the cockpit package before enabling the 
cockpit.socket service.
Procedure
1. If the web console is not installed by default on your installation variant, manually install the 
cockpit package:
# yum install cockpit
2. Enable and start the cockpit.socket service, which runs a web server:
# systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
3. If the web console was not installed by default on your installation variant and you are using a
custom firewall profile, add the cockpit service to firewalld to open port 9090 in the firewall:
# firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload
Verification steps
1. To verify the previous installation and configuration, open the web console.
1.3. LOGGING IN TO THE WEB CONSOLE

CHAPTER 8. CONFIGURING NETWORK BONDS USING THE
WEB CONSOLE
Learn how network bonding works and configure network bonds in the RHEL 8 web console.
NOTE
The RHEL 8 web console is build on top of the NetworkManager service.
For details, see Getting started with NetworkManager for managing networking.
Prerequisites
The RHEL 8 web console installed and enabled.
For details, see Installing the web console.
8.1. UNDERSTANDING NETWORK BONDING
Network bonding is a method to combine or aggregate network interfaces to provide a logical interface
with higher throughput or redundancy.
The active-backup, balance-tlb, and balance-alb modes do not require any specific configuration of
the network switch. However, other bonding modes require configuring the switch to aggregate the
links. For example, Cisco switches requires EtherChannel for modes 0, 2, and 3, but for mode 4, the
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) and EtherChannel are required.
For further details, see the documentation of your switch and Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO.
IMPORTANT
Certain network bonding features, such as the fail-over mechanism, do not support direct
cable connections without a network switch. For further details, see the Is bonding
supported with direct connection using crossover cables? KCS solution.
8.2. BOND MODES
In RHEL 8 there are several mode options. Each mode option is characterize by specific load balancing
and fault tolerance. The behavior of the bonded interfaces depends upon the mode. The bonding
modes provide fault tolerance, load balancing or both.
Load balancing modes
Round Robin: Sequentially transmit packets from the first available interface to the last one.
Fault tolerance modes
Active Backup: Only when the primary interface fails, one of a backup interfaces replaces it.
Only a MAC address used by active interface is visible.
Broadcast: All transmissions are sent on all interfaces.
CHAPTER 8. CONFIGURING NETWORK BONDS USING THE WEB CONSOLE
41

NOTE
Broadcasting significantly increases network traffic on all the bonded interfaces.
Fault tolerance and load balancing modes
XOR: The destination MAC addresses are distributed equally between interfaces with a modulo
hash. Each interface then serves the same group of MAC addresses.
802.3ad: Sets an IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation policy. Creates aggregation groups
that share the same speed and duplex settings. Transmits and receives on all interfaces in the
active aggregator.
NOTE
This mode requires a switch that is 802.3ad compliant.
Adaptive transmit load balancing: The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current
load on each interface. Incoming traffic is received by the current interface. If the receiving
interface fails, another interface takes over the MAC address of the failed one.
Adaptive load balancing: Includes transmit and receive load balancing for IPv4 traffic.
Receive load balancing is achieved through Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) negotiation,
therefore, it is necessary to set Link Monitoring to ARP in the bond’s configuration.
8.3. ADDING A NEW BOND USING THE WEB CONSOLE
Configure an active-backup bond on two or more network interfaces using the web console.
Other network bond modes can be configured similarly.
Prerequisites

3. In the Firewall section, click OFF to stop it.
If you do not see the Firewall box, log in to the web console with the administration privileges.
At this stage, the firewall has been stopped and does not secure your system.
13.3. ZONES
⁠firewalld can be used to separate networks into different zones according to the level of trust that the
user has decided to place on the interfaces and traffic within that network. A connection can only be
part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network connections.
NetworkManager notifies firewalld of the zone of an interface. You can assign zones to interfaces with:
NetworkManager
firewall-config tool
firewall-cmd command-line tool
The RHEL web console
The latter three can only edit the appropriate NetworkManager configuration files. If you change the
zone of the interface using the web console, firewall-cmd or firewall-config, the request is forwarded
to NetworkManager and is not handled by ⁠ firewalld.
The predefined zones are stored in the /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ directory and can be instantly applied
to any available network interface. These files are copied to the /etc/firewalld/zones/ directory only
after they are modified. The default settings of the predefined zones are as follows:
block
Any incoming network connections are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited message for IPv4 and
icmp6-adm-prohibited for IPv6. Only network connections initiated from within the system are
possible.
dmz
For computers in your demilitarized zone that are publicly-accessible with limited access to your
internal network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.
drop
CHAPTER 13. MANAGING FIREWALL USING THE WEB CONSOLE
65

Any incoming network packets are dropped without any notification. Only outgoing network
connections are possible.
external
For use on external networks with masquerading enabled, especially for routers. You do not trust the
other computers on the network to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.
home
For use at home when you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only selected incoming
connections are accepted.
internal
For use on internal networks when you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only
selected incoming connections are accepted.
public
For use in public areas where you do not trust other computers on the network. Only selected
incoming connections are accepted.
trusted
All network connections are accepted.
work
For use at work where you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only selected incoming
connections are accepted.
One of these zones is set as the default zone. When interface connections are added to 
NetworkManager, they are assigned to the default zone. On installation, the default zone in firewalld is

CHAPTER 17. MANAGING REDUNDANT ARRAYS OF
INDEPENDENT DISKS IN THE WEB CONSOLE
Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID) represents a way how to arrange more disks into one
storage. RAID protects data stored in the disks against disk failure.
RAID uses the following data distribution strategies:
Mirroring — data are copied to two different locations. If one disk fails, you have a copy and your
data is not lost.
Striping — data are evenly distributed among disks.
Level of protection depends on the RAID level.
The RHEL web console supports the following RAID levels:
RAID 0 (Stripe)
RAID 1 (Mirror)
RAID 4 (Dedicated parity)
RAID 5 (Distributed parity)
RAID 6 (Double Distributed Parity)
RAID 10 (Stripe of Mirrors)
Before you can use disks in RAID, you need to:
Create a RAID.
Format it with file system.
Mount the RAID to the server.
Prerequisites

Enterprise Linux 8, it will be installed on LVM automatically created during the installation.
The screenshot shows you a clean installation of the RHEL 8 system with two logical volumes in the
RHEL 8 web console automatically created during the installation.
To find out more about logical volumes, follow the sections describing:
What is logical volume manager and when to use it.
What are volume groups and how to create them.
What are logical volumes and how to create them.
How to format logical volumes.
How to resize logical volumes.
Prerequisites
The RHEL 8 web console has been installed.
For details, see Installing the web console.
The cockpit-storaged package is installed on your system.
Physical drives, RAID devices, or any other type of block device from which you can create the
logical volume.
18.1. LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGER IN THE WEB CONSOLE
CHAPTER 18. USING THE WEB CONSOLE FOR CONFIGURING LVM LOGICAL VOLUMES
93

The RHEL 8 web console provides a graphical interface to create LVM volume groups and logical
volumes.
Volume groups create a layer between physical and logical volumes. It makes you possible to add or
remove physical volumes without influencing logical volume itself. Volume groups appear as one drive
with capacity consisting of capacities of all physical drives included in the group.
You can join physical drives into volume groups in the web console.
Logical volumes act as a single physical drive and it is built on top of a volume group in your system.
Main advantages of logical volumes are:
Better flexibility than the partitioning system used on your physical drive.
Ability to connect more physical drives into one volume.
Possibility of expanding (growing) or reducing (shrinking) capacity of the volume on-line,
without restart.
Ability to create snapshots.
Additional resources
For details, see Configuring and managing logical volumes.
18.2. CREATING VOLUME GROUPS IN THE WEB CONSOLE
Create volume groups from one or more physical drives or other storage devices.
Logical volumes are created from volume groups. Each volume group can include multiple logical
volumes.

CHAPTER 22. LOCKING DATA WITH LUKS PASSWORD IN THE
RHEL WEB CONSOLE
In the web console’s Storage tab, you can now create, lock, unlock, resize, and otherwise configure
encrypted devices using the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) version 2 format.
This new version of LUKS offers:
More flexible unlocking policies
Stronger cryptography
Better compatibility with future changes
Prerequisites
The RHEL 8 web console has been installed.
For details, see Installing the web console.
The cockpit-storaged package is installed on your system.
22.1. LUKS DISK ENCRYPTION
The Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) enables you to encrypt block devices and it
provides a set of tools that simplifies managing the encrypted devices. LUKS allows multiple user keys
to decrypt a master key, which is used for the bulk encryption of the partition.
RHEL utilizes LUKS to perform block device encryption. By default, the option to encrypt the block
device is unchecked during the installation. If you select the option to encrypt your disk, the system
prompts you for a passphrase every time you boot the computer. This passphrase “unlocks” the bulk
encryption key that decrypts your partition. If you choose to modify the default partition table, you can
choose which partitions you want to encrypt. This is set in the partition table settings.
What LUKS does
LUKS encrypts entire block devices and is therefore well-suited for protecting contents of
mobile devices such as removable storage media or laptop disk drives.
The underlying contents of the encrypted block device are arbitrary, which makes it useful for
encrypting swap devices. This can also be useful with certain databases that use specially
formatted block devices for data storage.
LUKS uses the existing device mapper kernel subsystem.
LUKS provides passphrase strengthening, which protects against dictionary attacks.
LUKS devices contain multiple key slots, allowing users to add backup keys or passphrases.
What LUKS does not do
Disk-encryption solutions like LUKS protect the data only when your system is off. Once the
system is on and LUKS has decrypted the disk, the files on that disk are available to anyone who
would normally have access to them.
CHAPTER 22. LOCKING DATA WITH LUKS PASSWORD IN THE RHEL WEB CONSOLE
117

LUKS is not well-suited for scenarios that require many users to have distinct access keys to the
same device. The LUKS1 format provides eight key slots, LUKS2 up to 32 key slots.
LUKS is not well-suited for applications requiring file-level encryption.
Ciphers
The default cipher used for LUKS is aes-xts-plain64. The default key size for LUKS is 512 bits. The
default key size for LUKS with Anaconda (XTS mode) is 512 bits. Ciphers that are available are:
AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
Twofish (a 128-bit block cipher)
Serpent

CHAPTER 27. MANAGING VIRTUAL MACHINES IN THE WEB
CONSOLE
Manage your virtual machines in a RHEL 8 web console and learn about the virtualization management
capabilities.
To manage virtual machines in a graphical interface on a RHEL 8 host, you can use the Virtual Machines
pane in the RHEL 8 web console .
27.1. OVERVIEW OF VIRTUAL MACHINE MANAGEMENT USING THE
WEB CONSOLE
The RHEL 8 web console is a web-based interface for system administration. As one of its features, the
web console provides a graphical view of virtual machines (VMs) on the host system, and makes it
possible to create, access, and configure these VMs.
Note that to use the web console to manage your VMs on RHEL 8, you must first install a web console
plug-in for virtualization.
Next steps
For instructions on enabling VMs management in your web console, see Section 27.2, “Setting
up the web console to manage virtual machines”.
For a comprehensive list of VM management actions that the web console provides, see
Section 27.3, “Virtual machine management features available in the web console” .
For a list of features that are currently not available in the web console but can be used in the
virt-manager application, see Section 27.4, “Differences between virtualization features in
Virtual Machine Manager and the web console”.
27.2. SETTING UP THE WEB CONSOLE TO MANAGE VIRTUAL
MACHINES
Before using the RHEL 8 web console to manage virtual machines (VMs), you must install the web
console virtual machine plug-in on the host.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console
138

Prerequisites
Ensure that the web console is installed and enabled on your machine.
# systemctl status cockpit.socket
cockpit.socket - Cockpit Web Service Socket
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.socket
[...]
If this command returns Unit cockpit.socket could not be found, follow the Installing the web
console document to enable the web console.
Procedure
Install the cockpit-machines plug-in.
# yum install cockpit-machines
Verification
If the installation is successful, Virtual Machines appears in the web console side menu.
Additional resources
For instructions on connecting to the web console, as well as other information on using the web
console, see the Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console  document.
27.3. VIRTUAL MACHINE MANAGEMENT FEATURES AVAILABLE IN

27.4. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VIRTUALIZATION FEATURES IN
VIRTUAL MACHINE MANAGER AND THE WEB CONSOLE
The Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) application is supported in RHEL 8, but has been
deprecated. The web console is intended to become its replacement in a subsequent major release. It is,
therefore, recommended that you get familiar with the web console for managing virtualization in a GUI.
However, in RHEL 8, some VM management tasks can only be performed in virt-manager or the
command line. The following table highlights the features that are available in virt-manager but not
available in the RHEL 8.0 web console.
If a feature is available in a later minor version of RHEL 8, the minimum RHEL 8 version appears in the

CHAPTER 29. CONFIGURING SINGLE SIGN-ON FOR THE
RHEL 8 WEB CONSOLE IN THE IDM DOMAIN
Learn how to use Single Sign-on (SSO) authentication provided by Identity Management (IdM) in the
RHEL 8 web console.
Advantages:
IdM domain administrators can use the RHEL 8 web console to manage local machines.
Users with a Kerberos ticket in the IdM domain do not need to provide login credentials to
access the web console.
All hosts known to the IdM domain are accessible via SSH from the local instance of the RHEL 8
web console.
Certificate configuration is not necessary. The console’s web server automatically switches to a
certificate issued by the IdM certificate authority and accepted by browsers.
This chapter covers the following steps to configure SSO for logging into the the RHEL web console:
1. Add machines to the IdM domain using the RHEL 8 web console.
For details, see Section 29.1, “Joining a RHEL 8 system to an IdM domain using the web

CHAPTER 30. CONFIGURING SMART CARD
AUTHENTICATION WITH THE WEB CONSOLE FOR
CENTRALLY MANAGED USERS
Configure smart card authentication in the RHEL 8 web console for users who are centrally managed by:
Identity Management
Active Directory which is connected in the cross-forest trust with Identity Management
IMPORTANT
Smart card authentication does not elevate administrative privileges yet and the web 
console opens in the web browser in the read-only mode.
You can run administrative commands in the built-in terminal with `sudo`.
Prerequisites
The system for which you want to use the smart card authentication must be a member of an
Active Directory or Identity Management domain.
For details about joining the RHEL 8 system into a domain using the web console, see Joining a
RHEL 8 system to an IdM domain using the web console.
The certificate used for the smart card authentication must be associated with a particular user
in Identity Management or Active Directory.
For more details about associating a certificate with the user in Identity Management, see
Adding a certificate to a user entry in IdM .
30.1. SMART CARD AUTHENTICATION FOR CENTRALLY MANAGED
USERS
A smart card is a physical device, which can provide personal authentication using certificates stored on
the card. Personal authentication means that you can use smart cards in the same way as user
passwords.
You can store user credentials on the smart card in the form of a private key and a certificate. Special
software and hardware is used to access them. You insert the smart card into a reader or a USB socket
and supply the PIN code for the smart card instead of providing your password.
Identity Management (IdM) supports smart card authentication with:
User certificates issued by the IdM certificate authority. For details, see Configuring Identity
Management for smart card authentication.
User certificates issued by the Active Directory Certificate Service (ADCS) certificate authority.
For details, see Configuring certificates issued by ADCS for smart card authentication in IdM .
NOTE
If you want to start to use smart card authentication, see the hardware requirements:
Smart Card support in RHEL8 .
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console
160

30.2. INSTALLING TOOLS FOR MANAGING AND USING SMART CARDS
To configure your smart card, you need tools which can generate certificates and store them on a smart
card.
You must:
Install the gnutls-utils package which helps you to manage certificates.
Install the opensc package which provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart
cards.
Start the pcscd service which communicates with the smart card reader.
Procedure
1. Install the opensc and gnutls-utils packages:
# dnf -y install opensc gnutls-utils
2. Start the pcscd service.
# systemctl start pcscd
Verify that the pcscd service is up and running.
30.3. STORING A CERTIFICATE ON A SMART CARD
This section describes smart card configuration with the pkcs15-init tool, which helps you to configure:
Erasing your smart card
Setting new PINs and optional PIN Unblocking Keys (PUKs)
Creating a new slot on the smart card
Storing the certificate, private key, and public key in the slot
Locking the smart card settings (some smart cards require this type of finalization)
Prerequisites
The opensc package, which includes the pkcs15-init tool is installed.
For details, see Installing tools for managing and using smart cards .
The card is inserted in the reader and connected to the computer.
You have the private key, public key, and certificate to store on the smart card. In this
procedure, testuser.key, testuserpublic.key, and testuser.crt are the names used for the
private key, public key, and the certificate.
Your current smart card user PIN and Security Officer PIN (SO-PIN)
Procedure
CONFIGURING SMART CARD AUTHENTICATION WITH THE WEB CONSOLE FOR CENTRALLY MANAGED USERS
161

1. Erase your smart card and authenticate yourself with your PIN:
$ pkcs15-init --erase-card --use-default-transport-keys
Using reader with a card: Reader name
PIN [Security Officer PIN] required.
Please enter PIN [Security Officer PIN]:
The card has been erased.
2. Initialize your smart card, set your user PIN and PUK, and your Security Officer PIN and PUK:
$ pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15 --use-default-transport-keys \
    --pin 963214 --puk 321478 --so-pin 65498714 --so-puk 784123
Using reader with a card: Reader name
The pcks15-init tool creates a new slot on the smart card.
3. Set the label and the authentication ID for the slot:
$ pkcs15-init --store-pin --label testuser \
    --auth-id 01 --so-pin 65498714 --pin 963214 --puk 321478
Using reader with a card: Reader name
The label is set to a human-readable value, in this case, testuser. The auth-id must be two
hexadecimal values, in this case it is set to 01.
4. Store and label the private key in the new slot on the smart card:
$ pkcs15-init --store-private-key testuser.key --label testuser_key \
    --auth-id 01 --id 01 --pin 963214
Using reader with a card: Reader name
NOTE
The value you specify for --id must be the same when storing your private key,
and certificate. If you do not specify a value for --id, a more complicated value is
calculated by the tool and it is therefore easier to define your own value.
5. Store and label the certificate in the new slot on the smart card:
$ pkcs15-init --store-certificate testuser.crt --label testuser_crt \
    --auth-id 01 --id 01 --format pem --pin 963214
Using reader with a card: Reader name
6. (Optional) Store and label the public key in the new slot on the smart card:
$ pkcs15-init --store-public-key testuserpublic.key
    --label testuserpublic_key --auth-id 01 --id 01 --pin 963214
Using reader with a card: Reader name
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console
162

NOTE
If the public key corresponds to a private key and/or certificate, you should
specify the same ID as that private key and/or certificate.
7. (Optional) Some smart cards require you to finalize the card by locking the settings:
$ pkcs15-init -F
At this stage, your smart card includes the certificate, private key, and public key in the newly
created slot. You have also created your user PIN and PUK and the Security Officer PIN and
PUK.
30.4. ENABLING SMART CARD AUTHENTICATION FOR THE WEB
CONSOLE
To be able to use smart card authentication in the web console, enable smart card authentication in the 
cockpit.conf file.
Additionally, you can disable password authentication in the same file.
Prerequisites
The RHEL 8 web console has been installed.
For details, see Installing the web console.
Procedure
1. Log in to the RHEL web console with administrator privileges.
For details, see Logging in to the web console .
2. Click Terminal.
3. In the /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf, set the ClientCertAuthentication to yes:
[WebService]
ClientCertAuthentication = yes
4. Optionally, disable password based authentication in cockpit.conf with:
[Basic]
action = none
This configuration disables password authentication and you must always use the smart card.
5. Restart the web console to make sure that the cockpit.service accepts the change:
# systemctl restart cockpit
30.5. LOGGING IN TO THE WEB CONSOLE WITH SMART CARDS
You can use smart cards to log in to the web console.

163

Prerequisites
A valid certificate stored in your smart card that is associated to a user account created in a
Active Directory or Identity Management domain.
PIN to unlock the smart card.
The smart card has been put into the reader.
Procedure
1. Open your web browser and add the web console’s address in the address bar.
The browser asks you to add the PIN protecting the certificate stored on the smart card.
2. In the Password Required dialog box, enter PIN and click OK.
3. In the User Identification Request dialog box, select the certificate stored in the smart card.
4. Select Remember this decision.
The system does not open this window next time.
5. Click OK.
You are now connected and the web console displays its content.
30.6. LIMITING USER SESSIONS AND MEMORY TO PREVENT A DOS
ATTACK
Certificate authentication is protected by separating and isolating instances of the cockpit-ws web
server against attackers who wants to impersonate another user. However, this introduces a potential
Denial of Service (DoS) attack: A remote attacker could create a large number of certificates and send a
large number of HTTPS requests to cockpit-ws each using a different certificate.
To prevent this DoS, the collective resources of these web server instances are limited. By default, limits
to the number of connections and to memory usage are set to 200 threads and a 75% (soft) / 90%
(hard) memory limit.
The following procedure describes resource protection by limiting the number of connections and
memory.
Procedure
1. In the terminal, open the system-cockpithttps.slice configuration file:
# systemctl edit system-cockpithttps.slice
2. Limit the TasksMax to 100 and CPUQuota to 30%:
[Slice]
# change existing value
TasksMax=100
# add new restriction
CPUQuota=30%
3. To apply the changes, restart the system:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Managing systems using the RHEL 8 web console
164

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl stop cockpit
Now, the new memory and user session limits protect the cockpit-ws web server from DoS attacks.
