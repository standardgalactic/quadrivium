Who is the original author of the 
SOLID Principles of OOP?

Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin

What principle is the ’S’ in 
SOLID?

Single Responsibility Principle

Is the Dependency Inversion 
Principle the same as Dependency 
Injection?

No, Dependency Inversion addresses 
abstractions. While Dependency Injection refers 
to the injection of Dependencies into a class.

What are the three types of 
Dependency Injection

• By Property 
• By Setter 
• By Constructor

Which type of Dependency 
Injection should you favor?

By Constructor - This requires the 
dependency to be injected when the 
class is instantiated.

Can you use Dependency Injection 
against a private property in Spring?

Yes, Spring will support this, and inject the 
dependency using reﬂection at runtime. 
However, this is considered a VERY bad 
practice.

Is it good practice to use concrete 
classes for dependency injection?

No. You should use interfaces, which 
will allow the runtime environment to 
determine the implementation to inject.

What is IoC?

Inversion of Control - the runtime 
environment (or framework) which 
injects dependencies

What is the ‘L’ in SOLID?

Liskov Substitution Principle, by 
Barbara Liskov

What is the annotation used in 
Spring to indicate you want a 
dependency injected?

@Autowired

If you have two beans of the same 
type, how do you specify a 
preference for one over the other?

The @Primary annotation can be 
used to designate a primary bean

What are the two callback interfaces 
you can implement to tap into the 
bean lifecycle?

InitializingBean and 
DisposableBean

What two annotations can be used 
to access the Spring Bean lifecycle? 

@PostContstuct and 
@PreDestroy

How do you specify a bean 
name you want injected?

Use the @Qualiﬁer annotation
