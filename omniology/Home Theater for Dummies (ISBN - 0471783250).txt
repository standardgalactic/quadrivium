Authors’ Acknowledgments
Danny wants to thank his wife Holly and his kids, who, for the past four years,
had to “wait for next year when the neat new stuff is out” before upgrading
the house’s home theater arrangement. Holly holds the record for patience
endured; Danny is always testing new home theater gear in the house — in
his defense, Danny is able to say that he at least has gotten rid of the 11
remote controls in the living room! Danny also thanks his Mom and Dad,
whose unfailing support has been special throughout the years. And espe-
cially to his Mom who made him take those typing lessons as a kid with all
those yucky girls at the all-girls school — it has really come in handy.
Pat, as always, thanks his wife, Christine, for her infinite patience. (Is it
patience when one refrains from bonking his or her spouse over the head
with a cast iron skillet?) He also thanks her for gamely smiling and nodding
when he introduced, over and over again, pictures of the newest future member
of the Hurley family home theater, only to change his mind when he discovered
the next silicon (not silicone!) -laden object of his desire. Pat also thanks his
parents for letting him spend entirely too much time during his Christmas
visit hunched over his Powerbook. Pops — hope you get that universal remote
control figured out! Finally, he thanks his beautiful little girl, Annabel, who
provided ample distractions and smiles throughout this process — and Daddy
always lets her hog the plasma for the near-daily screening of The Lion King.
Danny and Pat want to thank the following people and organizations for their
support in writing this book: Joel Silver at Imaging Science Foundation, Jeff
Denenholz at X10 Ltd., Larry Becker at Crutchfield, Nick Carter and the rest
of the crew at AudioRequest, Kaleo Willess and Roger Dressler at Dolby
Laboratories, Shawn Gusz at G-NET Canada, John Dahl and Amy Brighouse
from THX, Ltd., and all those people manning the booths at CES ’06 in Las
Vegas who let us stare and gape at their rear-projection, plasma, and LCD
screens for hours on end. We’d thank them personally, but none of them gave
us one.
Also to our Acquisitions Editor, Steve Hayes, whom we kept on his toes as usual,
and to our Project Editor, Paul Levesque, who had the unenviable task of Danny
and Pat wrangling. Paul’s patience was the stuff of legends, and his editing let us
say what we wanted to say — only in proper English. Thanks Paul!

Introduction
T
he on-screen image looks crisp and sharp, like a huge moving photo-
graph. You feel entranced. More to the point, you feel the immediate urge
to own this video projector, provided it works with the DVD player and the
rest of your fledgling home theater gear.
An enthusiastic salesperson sees your look and enters the demonstration
room. “It’s really beautiful,” the salesperson proclaims. “That’s the first DLP
unit that works in true 1080p at 16:9. Yup, she’s a dream.”
Moments like that make you wish that people came with a pause button — or
at least an instant replay and color commentary.
For all the fun they bring and the good times they facilitate, home theaters
(and their sundry technologies) come with a bewildering blizzard of terms
and acronyms. Worse yet, it seems like everybody involved with the industry
either knows what the terms mean but can’t explain them or has no clue
about the true meanings but spouts the terms anyway. And neither of those
cases helps you make any sense of the whole thing.
That’s where the new and greatly improved 2nd edition of Home Theater For
Dummies makes its heroic entrance. (We’d cue up a low fog, some dramatic
lighting, and that mysterious “something cool might happen anytime now”
music to enhance the moment, but there’s only so much you can do in a
book.) Even without the special effects, this book still rescues you from all
kinds of home theater perils. Read on to find out how.
About This Book
The book takes you through the world of home theater from the bottom to
the top. Starting with a broad look at the basics of home theater concepts
and technology, Home Theater For Dummies presses onward with more
detailed information about source devices, surround sound gear, video dis-
play equipment, and PCs. The book even advises you about the theater room
itself, giving guidance about everything from furniture to popcorn machines.
Best of all, this book delivers the information in the friendly, patient, and
easy-to-understand manner that you know and expect from a title in the 
For Dummies line.

Get ready for one of the most enjoyable trips of your life. With this book at
your side, you’re ready for anything and everything that the industry (and
those questionable salespeople at the local equipment store) can throw at you.
Conventions Used in This Book
Unlike its famous and prolific computer-oriented brethren, Home Theater 
For Dummies keeps things pretty simple in the “conventions” department. We
use just a single bit of textual oddness that relates to Web sites. Any time we
talk about a World Wide Web address, you see the site address formatted in a
special font, like this: www.dummies.com.
Why? For one thing, the font makes the text stand out so that you know
exactly what to type into your browser. (Besides, we think the production
department got a special deal on that font, so they just like seeing it in the
books as much as possible.)
Just the (Techie) Facts, Ma’am
Although everything in the book meets rigorous standards for comprehen-
sion, usability, and lack of pointless geekiness, a few technical tidbits slipped
in accidentally. Well, they didn’t slip in accidentally; we wrote them that way.
At some point in the home theater process, you come face to face with tech-
nical tripe whether you want to or not. It’s better that you hear this stuff from
us than from some name-tagged know-it-all on a sales floor.
Foolish Assumptions
To write this book, we had to spend a lot of time in malls, video stores, and
movie theaters (that’s the hard part) doing “research.” While doing so, we
pondered all kinds of questions concerning you, the reader. Who are you?
Where are you? What did you eat for lunch? Which movies pique your inter-
est? How do your home theater desires line up with your budget? Queries like
that fill our minds constantly, much to the consternation of our spouses, who
prefer more useful thoughts like, “Shouldn’t you take the trash out?”
Because we never get to meet you in person, we end up making a few
assumptions about you and what you want from this book. Here’s a peek at
our thoughts about you:
2
Home Theater For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

 You love movies, television shows, or video games — or perhaps all
three.
 You’ve experienced wide screens and surround sound at the theater, and
you liked it.
 For one reason or another, a 19-inch TV set with a single built-in speaker
doesn’t adequately meet your audio or video entertainment desires.
 You probably own a computer or will soon.
 You don’t shy away from high-tech products, but you also aren’t the first
person on the block with the latest electronic goodie.
 The weird technicalities of home theater circle around you like planes
buzzing King Kong.
 You know something about the Internet and the Web and probably have
high-speed access to the Internet or will soon.
 You (or someone in your family) enjoy watching movies, listening to MP3
audio, playing games, and possibly making movies on your computer.
If that describes you in detail or at least catches some of your shadow in
passing, then this book is for you.
How This Book Is Organized
Rather than haphazardly fling information at you and hope that some of it
sticks, we clump related topics together into six parts. Here’s a peek at what
they cover.
Part I: Welcome to the 
World of Home Theater
With home theater, the trek begins here, in Part I, which covers the basics of
the basics, starting with a look at what home theater really means, includes,
requires, and offers. From there, it looks at what it takes to get into a home
theater, in terms of space, timing, budget, and equipment. In Chapter 4, we
get a little techie, but necessarily so, by giving you some solid insight into the
terms and technologies that you will encounter. More and more, terms like
DLP, 3LCD, and HDMI are on the shelf description tags when you go to Best
Buy. You need this baseline knowledge for the rest of the book, so read
Chapter 4 closely. In fact, read it twice. (It’s even better the second time
around.)

Introduction

Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?:
Source Devices
Home theater installations really contain two parts: source and presentation.
Part II covers all kinds of sources, ranging from the prerecorded offerings of
DVD players and VCRs to the over-the-air-and-through-the-sky action of
broadcast TV and satellite dishes. As an added bonus, this part even takes
you on a tour of the personal video recorder (PVR), possibly the most
groundbreaking entertainment device since the VCR itself, as well as state-of-
the-art gaming platforms. (Pat performed that excruciating gaming research.)
We also talk about your PC and the growing role it plays in sourcing audio,
video, gaming, and other content for your system. To top that, we then tell
you all you need to know about accessing the Internet for cool things like
finding that episode of Lost that you missed.
Part III: Watching and Listening: 
Display and Control Devices
Part III focuses on the control and presentation aspects of your system, with
in-depth looks at your receivers, controllers, speakers, and video displays.
We look at all-in-one receivers and separates, such as controllers and power
amps. On the video side, this part explores the strange world of television
sets (which looked pretty simple until a few years ago when HDTV arrived on
the scene) and video projection systems, which are home theater’s answer to
the movie house’s silver screen, and which are becoming so affordable we
think you’ll get one just so you can watch the Super Bowl on a 12-foot screen!
Then, all eyes — er, ears — turn to audio for details about surround sound
systems, speakers, and more. Finally, we talk about remote controls — an
often overlooked area that deserves more attention. A remote control is your
single biggest interface to the system, so we give you some options here.
Part IV: Putting It All Together
With your location selected, your gear picked out, and your walls trembling
in fear, it’s time to install your theater, and Part IV guides you through the
process. In fact, hooking up your home theater is one of the harder parts of
the experience. We start with the basics — the different types of cabling —
and work our way up to connecting all the different components into a work-
ing system. Toward the end of Part IV, we give you advice on how to link your
home entertainment system to other TVs and systems in the house. After all,
you paid a lot of money for your theater — why not get the most use from it
that you can?

Home Theater For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part V: Letting Your Home Theater 
Be All It Can Be
You might think that your home theater equipment is out-of-the-box ready to
be plugged together and to start playing movies, but it’s not that simple.
Almost every part of your system needs to be tuned like a nice grand piano.
Although we use big words and phrases such as calibration and bass manage-
ment in this part, these merely relate to fine-tuning your system to itself and
its environs. We also give you ideas for sprucing up your home theater with
fancy lights and soundproofing (the latter of which is great for those late-
night sleepovers the kids have). We tell you how to access your home theater
content from your car as well as from your cellphone (very cool) and laptop
when out and about. We end the part with a cool look at the higher end of
home theater — the things you can dream about during those long trips to
Grandma’s.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Like all other For Dummies books, Home Theater For Dummies closes with a
look at life from the humorous side with perky Part VI, the Part of Tens. Each
chapter counts off a bunch of goodies that help you show off, troubleshoot,
and generally accessorize your theater.
Icons Used in This Book
There’s a lot of stuff in here, and amidst all that material, the really important
details can sometimes be overlooked. To point out the important stuff (and
highlight the technicalities you might want to avoid), the book relies on sev-
eral helpful icons. Each icon identifies a particular type of information. Here’s
a quick field guide to what each of these little billboards means:
Whenever you see the Remember icon, grab a handy mental highlighter (and
maybe a real one, too) and mark the section because this information might
come in handy at any moment, either now or in the future.
Everybody looks for tips (particularly in the stock market, at the race track, 
and at your favorite restaurant). When a Tip icon shows up in Home Theater
For Dummies, it points out information destined to simplify your life. You
can’t go wrong with a Tip!
5
Introduction

When a topic includes technology, technical tripe always finds its way into the
book. At some point or another in the home theater experience, you need to
know the geek-speak. Don’t fear paragraphs with these icons, but don’t rush
to them, either. Just brace yourself for the technical onslaught, secure in the
knowledge that this book protects you from the worst of the techno-drivel.
Nothing in your home theater really threatens personal peril — at least no
more peril than you get from plugging in a toaster or accidentally watching a
bad movie at your local theater. In those rare moments when inserting the
right plug in the wrong socket could spell doom for your gear, the Warning
icon hops into action. When you see one of these, stop for a moment, read
the text, and double-check your progress before continuing.
Where to Go from Here
Apart from the pleasing shade of yellow on the cover, the best part of a For
Dummies book is its open and available layout — you can start anywhere you
want. If you already know the stuff in Chapter 1, dive in somewhere else
instead. Where you start and what you read depends entirely on what you
need to know right now.
Read over the Table of Contents to see whether any topics really jump out at
you. If nothing does, try finding a starting point in one of these:
 If you just jumped into the front row of home theater enthusiasts, start
in Chapter 1. It gives you a good overview of how a home theater works,
what it takes, and what to do next.
 Curious about the content — the movies and shows — appearing in
your theater? Part II delves into DVD and VHS, plus satellite, broadcast,
and cable TV. It even peers into the promising realm of personal video
recorders (the TiVo is good example here) , and PC-driven content.
 For an in-depth look at the sound and video presentation side of your
entertainment empire, visit the chapters of Part III.
 For help getting your system connected and tweaked for the finest audio
and video quality, skip on over to Part IV.
With that, leap into the world of home theater. Lights, camera, action — 
welcome to your adventure!

Part I
Welcome to the
World of Home
Theater

In this part . . .
I
t’s important to start your adventure with some solid
basics — what’s a home theater, why do you want one,
what do all the various terms mean?
Part I lays a solid foundation for talking about home the-
ater. An understanding of all your options not only helps
you on the showroom floor but also helps you when the
time comes to install your gear and tune it so that it does
what it was intended to do. Indeed, a lot of home theater
is about making sure that your system is configured cor-
rectly for your environment, and to do that, you need to
know what it’s supposed to be doing in the first place.
(We’re sure there’s some pithy phrase, like “cart before
the horse,” to throw in here now, but we never use those
correctly. So think of a phrase of your choice here.)
We then follow up with some high-level basics about your
home theater and its environment. We discuss things like
where to put a home theater in your house and how to
control it. We also delve into that hot topic — price.
Then we walk you through all the things that make up the
home theater at a high level — sources, outputs, PCs,
cables, broadband, and so on.
And finally, we go a little deeper into the key terms, stan-
dards, and technologies that we use throughout the book.
Here’s where we talk about a lot of the things that proba-
bly got you to buy this book in the first place — the alpha-
bet soup of home theater.
After you finish this part, you’ll know enough to be dan-
gerous in your local electronics store. (So be sure to read
the rest of the book, too, so that you know how to control
your now dangerous mind.)

In This Chapter
 Going Hollywood with home theater
 Finding room for a home theater
 Getting a stylish home theater on a budget
 Getting your money’s worth
W
hen you hear the term home theater, you probably think of big screens,
cool sound, DVDs, CDs, and lots of remote controls sitting around your
living room. We’re sure that football games, beer, and other fun images sneak
into that image as well.
Home theater is truly for everyone — regardless of the size of your house 
or apartment, your economic wealth, or your taste in movies. And home the-
ater is bound to mean something different to everyone. It’s not just about 
the gear — the boxes, the cables, the remotes, the DVDs, the CDs, the iPods,
the whatever. It’s really about embarking on what can be a great adventure.
Appreciating the Art of the Home Theater
Before you start on your home theater adventure, it’s critical to understand
what the makers of the equipment, movies, standards, audio CDs, and so on
mean when they say that they support home theater.
To the companies that produce the equipment and media, home theater is all
about trying to re-create — in your home — the experience of watching a film
in a movie theater, hearing the cheers of the crowd in a football stadium, or
feeling the reverberations of music at an open-air concert. Many of the people
who devote themselves to creating atmosphere and mood using this medium
consider what they do to be an art form. These are usually the people who are
listed in the credits at the end of a movie.

When you take all the sensations of a movie theater and insert them in your
living room, you’re on your way to successfully re-creating that “immersive”
feeling you get at the movies. All the improvements in sound compression,
surround sound, digital screen imaging, and so on, have been done not to sell
more equipment at Circuit City or Wal-Mart, but to try to perfect the ability to
draw you into another world where you can experience a truly creative piece
of work.
So a lot of this book is about explaining the technologies and ideas behind the
home theater that you are going to put together, because it’s not just about
seven speakers hooked into your stereo or a big honking TV screen. It’s about
how to make sure everything is put in its proper place to maximize your home
theater out-of-body experience — the way the media creators intended.
Fitting Home Theater’s Many Faces 
into All Kinds of Spaces
You’ve probably watched enough TV shows and movies about Hollywood
and the rich and famous to know that, for some people, home theaters are as
common as a kitchen or a bedroom. Indeed, home theaters were spawned
from the necessity of filmmakers to preview footage, screen tests, and full
movies. They gradually grew to be a status symbol among actors, too, and
spread out from there.
In those early days, a home theater was pretty much literally that: a small
theater with Peerless Magnarc carbon-arc lamphouses and theater seating.
They were often extensive and elaborate affairs — to match the surrounding
house.
Today, you too can get into the act, and you’re lucky enough to have a broad
range of projectors, screens, displays, seating, and equipment — heck, even
popcorn machines — available to create your own home theater.
Probably the first big decision you have to make is where you want to put
your home theater. It was one thing to figure out where to put your 19-inch
TV set; it’s another thing to think about where to put a big-screen TV with six
speakers and associated A/V gear. Few people are prepared for how overpow-
ering a full home theater setup can be in a small home, so it’s especially
important to plan ahead if you have limited space.
Defining your home theater space is a necessary first step. If the only place to
put a TV is on the mantle above the fireplace, then you’re looking at a plasma
screen TV and not much else. If you have to fit the whole system into the
corner of the living room, then that narrows the search as well. Remember,
you don’t want to buy a home theater that just won’t fit into your home and
10
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

your lifestyle. A home theater is all about creating a surround atmosphere, so
pick your spaces and work from there.
You can most certainly put a home theater in your present living room, in
your bedroom, or in a room devoted to your theater. In the end, what matters
is not so much the size, but the way you establish its ability to coax you into
its sound field and video experience.
Budgeting for Home Theater
We believe in setting expectations. We don’t want to get you salivating over a
37-inch LCD and a nice Harmon Kardon system and then smack you over the
head with an unrealistic price. Unfortunately, a quick stroll through any con-
sumer electronics store could lead you to believe that you can get an entry-
level whole-home theater in a box (without the video display, of course) for
just $199. However, that $199 system will be right for some people and not 
for others.
Exploring equipment and prices
So what does it cost to get into a home theater system? Table 1-1 gives you
an idea of what you can spend. We’ve broken this table down by the roles
that each group of audio/video (A/V) components plays in your home the-
ater. (Audio sources are devices that provide audio-only playback in your
system, whereas video sources provide movies or TV content.) The A/V
system provides the control for your home theater (meaning it lets you select
what you want to watch or listen to) and does all the heavy lifting in terms of
sending surround sound signals to your speaker system. The video display, 
of course, is what you watch (think TV). We’ve also included some optional
components — gaming systems and home theater PCs (which let you use a
PC as a high-quality audio and/or video source device).
Over time, components have been doing the integrating thing better and better.
You can find really good DVD/VCR combos, for instance. Receivers can now
control your video signals as well as audio ones. Personal video recorders are
coming as part of many digital cable and satellite set-top boxes. We talk about
the advantages of individual components versus more integrated units in
Chapter 11.
Also note that these prices are a snapshot in time — they are continually
dropping, so don’t be surprised to find everything on this list available for
even less money when you go shopping.

** You don’t need all of these parts, just an all-in-one system, an A/V receiver, or a

*** You only need one of these displays.
Certainly, you don’t need all the gear in Table 1-1. You can buy a nice all-in-
one home theater system and a relatively big-screen, direct-view (picture
tube) TV for not much more than $500. Of course, you can spend a lot more
money, too. One thing is for sure: Pricing is competitive and is changing all
the time. Two years ago, a lot of the gear listed in Table 1-1 cost twice as
much as it does now. As we go to print, the first 42-inch plasma screen TVs
for under $2,000 are hitting the market.
To get a quick grasp on pricing, go to a few Web sites, such as www.
circuitcity.com and www.plasmatvbuyingguide.com to get a sense 
of the going rate for different items. Compare that with Table 1-1 to get a
sense of how much pricing has dropped just in the time that it took for this
book to hit the shelves.
Buying on a budget
Given that you are probably working within a budget, here are some ideas
about what you can expect to buy and install for different total budget ranges:
 $0 to $500: Definitely the entry-level package for home theater, a system
in the under-$500 range basically uses your existing TV (or includes an
inexpensive TV in the 27-inch range) and an entry-level all-in-one home
theater system package (which comes with all the speakers you need for
surround sound and a receiver/DVD player combo). You can probably
throw in a $50 VCR if you don’t already have one, but even the lowest
level all-in-one home theater sets include DVD players. (Gotta have DVD!)
13
Chapter 1: The Zen of Home Theater

 $500 to $2,000: By spending a little more, you can go up a range in a
number of the components and get HDTV into your home theater (which
we highly recommend — especially as all TVs convert to digital in
2009!). You can spend some of this money on an entry-level tube HDTV
(you can get a 30-inch widescreen HDTV-ready TV for under $800). You
could even move up to a rear-projection TV; they start around $1,200 for
a 40- to 52-inch screen. There are a range of options for better surround
sound systems in this price range, with packaged options available for
your five surround sound speakers plus your subwoofer. And you can
buy a fairly good A/V receiver to drive the system. Top this all off with a
portable MP3 player and a DVD player for the car, and your kids will love
you (more).
 $2,000 to $5,000: At this level, you start to create serious options for a
very decent home theater system. The lowest-cost plasma and LCD
screens are under $1,000, or for a bigger picture, you can go with a digital
(LCD or DLP) rear-projection unit with a great high-def picture (starting
at around $1,500). You might budget $500 or more for a high-definition-
capable DVD player in this price range as well. On the audio side, you can
spend $1,000 or so on a relatively fancy all-in-one system, but at this
price level, you can also start to get serious with separate components,
getting a very good A/V receiver, DVD/CD player/recorder, personal video
recorder, gaming system, surround sound speakers, and potentially even
more. At this price range, the average person can get a mighty fine
system.
 $5,000 to $10,000: When you top $5,000 as your budget, you can start
expanding in some wonderful ways by adding more throughout the
house through multizone capabilities, whole-home audio, and universal
remote control capability, or you can continue to go up the ladder in
terms of higher-quality separates. We swear by audio servers that store
all your music in one box. Get one for the car, too, and have them sync up
when you drive in the driveway. Front-projection TVs become a viable
option in this price range; good projectors start around $2,000. No matter
what you choose — flat-panel, rear-projection, or front-projection — in
this price range, you should expect a big (50-inch or more) high-definition
display. Or, you can get fancy with furniture. Good home theater seats
start around $350 each. A high-quality universal remote control costs
about $500.
 $10,000+: Above $10,000, the sky is truly the limit. For $10,000 to $20,000,
you get to enjoy a lot of the next generation of home theater. Your TV
should be big and capable of playing 1080p (1920 x 1080 pixels — the high-
est resolution of HDTV) signals. Your DVD player should be top of the line,
supporting Blu-ray or HD-DVD. You probably want some extra amplifier
equipment in the system, and you may also want to boost your controls,
perhaps with a nice Crestron wireless touch screen control. If you get
14
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

above $20,000, you are into high-end audiophile-type stuff all the way.
Whole-home audio and video, integration with home automation systems,
consultants — the works. Believe it or not, it is not unusual for people to
spend $1 million or more on a home theater. At that point, we think a lot of
money is being paid for custom interior design, top-of-the-line projectors,
and so on. Nothing is held back. To us, given more modest expectations, a
$25,000 system is stunning in almost all senses of the word.
Getting Your Money’s Worth
In deciding how much to spend overall, we can give you only this advice:
Your home entertainment system is probably one of the most-used parts of
your home. It helps define your family, social life, business relationships, and
so on. It’s important, but spend within your means. You also want to save
something for the future. Building and growing a home theater is fun, too.
One of the great things about home theater is that it is modular, so you don’t
have to buy the whole thing all at once. If you really want a great TV display,
get it, and go cheaper on the other components. And when you are ready to
trade up, figure out what you want next. The better stereo stores have a
trade-up policy that gives you credit toward getting something better. And
then there’s always eBay (www.ebay.com) or similar auction sites, where
you can get all sorts of gear in great condition — everyone is always trading
in stuff to move to higher levels, so don’t feel pressured to do it all at once.
Realize that, even if you are installing home theater wiring and speakers into
the walls and such, you’re not likely to ‘get that money back’ when you sell the
house. People are leery of other people’s home-grown solutions — even the
professional ones — and equipment becomes outdated quickly in this industry.
So if you are going to do some remodeling and spend some money, recognize
that you are doing it for yourself first, everyone else second, and by all means
not for the money.
Indeed, a lot of this book is about getting your money’s worth out of what-
ever you buy. If you get an all-in-one home theater system for $199 from
Radio Shack, or a high-end system with, say, a $37,000 Faroudja projector,
$18,000 worth of MartinLogan Prodigy speakers, a $4,000 B&K Receiver, and
other similarly priced (but well worth it) components, you’re still going to
need to figure out how to get the most out of the system. So stay tuned to
find out how to get more per kHz, or disc, or channel, or whatever you track
your home theater fun by.

C
onsumer electronics have played a major role throughout the years in
defining not just how we live in our own homes, but also how we live as
a society. The radio, then black-and-white TV, then color TV, and then all the
various adjuncts to the TV and radio — VCRs, gaming consoles, tape decks,
and so on — have all helped define who we are and how we interact with
each other. The “edgier” radio and TV shows over the years have had a 
profound social impact by acting out for us the crossing of various social 
barriers — for instance, the first on-screen interracial kiss, the first portrayal
of a woman president, and the first portrayal of a black president.
The home has grown around these devices, so when it comes time to put
these together on a pedestal and proclaim them a “home theater,” this act
seems to acknowledge the role that home electronics have come to play in
our lifestyles.
The Basic Home Theater
So what’s in a home theater then? Well, a home theater is largely what you
make of it, but we think that at least three major elements constitute the core
of a home theater:
 A large-screen display: Note that we do not say television. More and
more, the receiver aspect of a television is being divorced from the display
aspect, in the form of set-top boxes, external TV tuners, computers, and

18
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
other source devices. Appropriately, the display is being optimized for
its main purpose — displaying the wide range of video output from a
home theater system. These displays can be huge. We’re talking greater
than 120 inches diagonally, which is 10 feet for those of you who didn’t
do the math!
 A digital video source: At a minimum, this means a DVD player, and for
most folks, it will also mean a TV source (like digital cable or a digital
satellite TV service). We think that DVD is a bottom-line must-have when
you’re building a home theater because that’s the way most of us access
the movies we want to watch.
For most people, this includes a source (or sources) of high-definition
video, from TV broadcasts or the next generation of DVDs.
 A surround sound capability: You find out about the details of surround
sound in a few pages, but you need to have surround sound to take 
full advantage of all the audio power stored in your DVD content. With
surround sound, you truly start mimicking the theater experience.
If you’re lacking any of these, you really don’t have a home theater. Without
the display and surround sound, you lose the impact of the visual and audio
experience, and without a digital video source, you just have a loud and big
TV system. You really need all three. Figure 2-1 shows these elements in their
native environment — your home.

But you need not stop there. There are all sorts of other great ways — besides
a DVD player — to get digital video up on your big screen display for you, as
well as great devices you can add to enhance your overall experience. The
rest of this chapter is devoted to really fleshing out the boundaries of your
home theater realm.
The Complete Home Theater
In our discussion of budgets in Chapter 1, we give you a peek at what a really
fleshed-out home theater might contain. Here’s a fairly comprehensive list of
what you typically put in your home theater (we leave out the all-in-one units
because they merely integrate various combinations of these devices into
one unit):
 Sources: These provide the content you watch or listen to.
• Audio cassette player/recorder
• CD player/recorder/MP3 player
• Turntable
• AM/FM tuner
• DVD player/recorder
• VCR
• Personal video recorder (PVR, also called a digital video recorder
[DVR] by some folks)
• Camcorder
• Satellite or cable set-top box
• Video/audio server
• Gaming console
• Home theater PC or Windows XP Media Center PC (a specific
Microsoft software product; see Chapter 8)
 Receivers/controllers: The heart of the system, these feed content to
your displays and speakers.
• A/V receiver
• Controller/decoder
• Power amplifier
19
Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home

 Displays: This is what you watch.
• Direct-view, rear-projection, or flat-panel TV display
• Front-projection system with separate display screen
 Speakers: These are what you listen to.
• Two front speakers
• One front center speaker
• Two side speakers
• Two or four rear speakers
• Subwoofer
 Connections: These are connections to content inside and outside your
home.
• Over-the-air antenna
• Satellite or cable video feed
• Internet connectivity — preferably broadband, such as DSL or
cable modem
• Home network — preferably both wired and wireless to make the
connection between your Internet service and your home theater
and your home theater and your PC (with Media Center Edition) or
Mac (with Apple’s Front Row)
 Accessories: These are devices that make your home-stored content
accessible from elsewhere.
• Universal remote controls and touchpads
• Internet access devices
• Home media servers and digital media adapters
Naturally, as you extend your home theater to other points in your home, you
can add to the quantities mentioned here, but most of the components are
the same. You also might choose different qualities and (in the case of displays)
sizes of these things, but the basic formula remains the same.
Using Your Existing Gear
A question that comes across most people’s minds when they look to
upgrade to a home theater is whether any of their existing A/V gear can be
used in their new home theater.
20
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

The answer usually is, “Well you probably can, but you lose a lot by doing so
(unless the gear is less than two years old, and in some cases, even that is old).”
If you are thinking about using existing equipment, consider the following:
 TVs: If it’s smaller than a 27-inch display, why bother? Home theater
needs a big-screen display for maximum effect. The most important
thing to consider when reviewing the capabilities of your old TV is this:
Can it display HD (high-definition) pictures? If not, you’ll probably want to
consider an upgrade. Also check for features like picture-in-picture, and
make sure your TV has the right kinds of inputs to accept the latest and
greatest source devices (look for HDMI or DVI, discussed in Chapter 13).
TV size requirements are actually a mix of three things: the size of the
display, the display’s resolution (or number of individual picture elements
that make up the picture on your screen), and your viewing distance
from the screen. In Chapter 13 we provide some concrete guidance
about the best size display for your particular home theater. For most
home theaters, a bigger display is better, but if you’re planning on viewing
from a relatively short distance (a few feet, for example), you might be
better off with a relatively small screen.
 Receivers: Chances are your receiver is an audio (stereo) receiver,
which probably doesn’t have surround sound processing capability,
inputs for video gear, or built-in amplifiers for your surround sound
speakers. You can use an audio-only receiver as an amplifier to drive
some speakers, but if you want to listen to the latest surround sound
capabilities, which are encoded on most DVDs, then you’re going to
need a new audio/video receiver, period. What’s more, if you have a lot
of video sources, you are going to want to switch among them — and for
that you’ll need a receiver with sophisticated video switching.
 VCRs: As long as your VCR is a VHS HiFi VCR, it’s just fine. But it won’t
replace a DVD player, which has about four times the picture resolution
of a VCR (meaning the picture is about twice as sharp and detailed).
 CD players: Your CD player will probably work fine. Depending on your
space constraints, however, you might just use your DVD player to play
your CDs because the two are compatible. Over time, CD players will 
disappear from your system in favor of a combined disc playing/recording
unit.
 DVD players: Your DVD player will probably play fine, but if it cannot
record, you’ll miss out. With the latest personal video recorders, you will
want to archive and offload all sorts of content to DVDs, and for that,
you’ll want a DVD player/recorder to burn the DVDs. Keep in mind that
you can often use a PC (with the right software onboard) for the DVD
recording functionality — we talk about PCs in the home theater in
Chapter 8.
21
Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home

 Speakers: Chances are these are not going to be very useful because 
you really want a set of speakers, not ones that are pieced together.
Speakers work in tandem and therefore should have a similar foundation
of performance. If you have a pair of stereo speakers that you can 
match into a complete set of surround sound speakers from the same
manufacturer, you might be able to use what you have (we recommend
that you choose additional speakers that are timbre matched with your
existing speakers).
 Other stuff: Most other stuff can work with your system. Turntables,
cassette decks, laser disc players, and so on can plug in and play their
part without any problems.
 Internet connection: Okay, your connection isn’t gear in the traditional
sense, but still, if you’re using a dialup connection, you should seriously
consider upgrading to broadband if you want your home theater to take
advantage of the Internet. As present and future consumer devices become
increasingly reliant on the Internet for accessing information and content,
you’ll need a broadband connection to download this content.
Choosing a Room
As you build your home theater, all roads lead back to optimizing that illusion
of participation, and where you put your system plays a big part. Here’s a 
list of things to think about when determining the right place for your home
theater — and there are definitely wrong places to put your home theater:
 Think about lighting: The amount of ambient light in a room, day or
night, can substantially affect the experience. A nice, dark room actually
makes the room itself disappear when watching a film, enabling that 
suspension of disbelief we keep aspiring to. Think about how lights from
other rooms or street lighting might affect the experience.
 Think about dimensions: You tend to get more awkward sound patterns
in perfectly square rooms. The best place to put the centerpiece of your
system — the TV display — is along the short wall of a rectangular room,
preferably a wall without windows or doors on it. Fully enclosed rooms
are best for sound. You can pull heavy curtains across an open wall
when you are watching films in your home theater.
 Think about sound: Although people typically place a couch up against
a wall, with a home theater, you want enough space behind you so that
the sound can get in back of you and truly surround you. So the ideal
position for the seating is more central to the room.
22
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

 Think about the picture: Sit close enough to your display to maximize
the perceived size of the picture, but not so close that you see a somewhat
grainy picture because you can see the lines on the TV set (that’s too
close). The bigger your display, the farther back you need to be to not
see the lines. Also think about angle of viewing — all displays have a 
preferred angle of viewing.
 Think about walls: A rather muted color or wall covering — book cases
are ideal — absorbs stray light. A dark gray or black room is best, or one
with heavy, colored drapes. (Now you know why you see all those drapes
and carpeted walls in theaters!) The last thing you want is a brightly 
colored high-gloss paint that reflects light, creating light ghosts to the
sides of the screen! Think also about removing or covering mirrors and
picture frames; they do the same thing.
Take note of the front and rear wall surfaces because, in general, you
want to control the way your sound reflects off these surfaces. Typically,
you want the back wall to be a little reflective to help build a more general
sound field behind your seating area.
 Think about floors: Yup, the floors, too. Bare tile or wood causes
acoustical reflections that mess up your sound field. A good rug can
absorb stray sounds that can affect the crispness of your signal.
 Think about stray noise: Listen closely to your room for regular interfering
sounds, such as a clock ticking or a fish tank pump. Consider moving
these devices if you can. And if the sound is coming externally, like from
the dryer or washer, consider some cheap absorptive wall coverings to
muffle it.
We talk about creating a home theater environment in more detail in Chapter 20.
Organizing Your Gear
The most obvious and easy place for all your home theater gear is where you
historically have placed it — right next to the TV. And indeed, there’s nothing
inherently wrong with this approach. However, we ask you to look ahead for a
moment and think about the investment you’ll make in your home theater and
how you’d like to take advantage of that throughout your home. To do this,
you need to think of ways your home theater’s components can be used in a
whole-home network. This whole-home planning can make your home theater
itself better, too, because it facilitates connections between the home theater
and other networks that might feed into it, such as your cable connection or
your Internet connection.
23
Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home

Setting up a central wiring panel
Think about designating a space in your house as a central wiring panel where
you can centrally house a lot of your whole-home infrastructure equipment
(devices that let you connect the home theater to the rest of the house).
Remember that most of your commonly used, ultra-sensitive electronics gear
will probably go right next to your home theater. You are better off relegating
the gear that you just “plug and forget” (like video distribution panels that
send your cable TV throughout the home) to a panel in an out-of-the-way
place. Some of the devices that you might connect on a wiring panel include
the following:
 Home cable interconnections with your cable company
 Home phone interconnections with your telephone company
 A centralized distribution point for your satellite dish wiring, if you 
have one
 Cable, DSL, satellite, or ISDN modems and routers, if you have them
 Ethernet hubs or switches for your Internet connection
You can also put items such as home servers and some of your central media
equipment on the wiring panel if you don’t need to get to it regularly and you
need the extra space. Multizone amplifiers or MP3 servers are examples of
such equipment.
Appreciating the advantages of a central wiring panel
By designating a central wiring panel, you gain some huge benefits:
 Hiding wires: Your home theater gear has a lot of cables and can have a
lot of gear you rarely touch. A well-integrated home theater setup has a
lot of cables hidden in the walls or running out of sight. We’re not just
talking component wiring (such as the wires between your DVD player
and your A/V receiver), but also connections to your phone network
(required by a satellite dish), to your Internet connection (could be 
wireless, but wireline is better long term), to your IR (infrared) remote
control network (more on this in Chapter 15), and other connections.
Think of your wiring panel as a place where everything can connect to
everything else in the easiest fashion.
 Hiding hardware: Much of the hardware that facilitates home theater
and whole-home networking (things such as power amps, video 
modulators, distribution panels, punchdown blocks, and the like) is
designed with function in mind rather than form. A central wiring panel
can put this hardware out of view. And that means less clutter for where
you have the stuff that you get at the most, like your VCR or your DVD
player.
24
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

 Connecting at a single point: Having a central connection point makes it
easier to get networks like cable or your Internet-connected computer
LAN (Local Area Network) into the home theater. It also makes it easier
for you to get movies and music out of your home theater and share
them throughout the home or access them when traveling.
 Providing easy access: When you want to change the capabilities of
your networks or troubleshoot a problem, having everything neatly
arranged and easily accessible can eliminate a source of frustration.
The wiring panel should be in a place that is out of sight but is also easily
accessible. It needs to have plenty of space and adequate power to run a
great deal of equipment. Then, whatever you need to bring up to the media
hub in the home theater, you can, through a range of easily connected wiring
plates that make it look neat and more accessible at the same time.
Locating your wiring panel’s home
In the best-case scenario (like when you’ve struck it rich and are building a
custom-designed home), you can create a dedicated room for your home 
theater and associated equipment — a central wiring panel just like modern
offices and other commercial buildings have.
If we were starting a home from scratch this way, we’d try to design the
wiring panel
 On the main floor of the house
 Near an outside wall for easy interconnection to incoming service feeds
 Above an accessible part of the basement (if you have a basement)
 With adequate lighting, ventilation, and climate protection (not in the
garage, in other words)
 With adequate AC power line receptacles to power devices, such as
video amplifiers, Ethernet hubs, and phone systems
Such a panel needn’t be too large. Most home theater equipment takes up
one rack at the most.
Of course, the vast majority of homeowners or remodelers simply don’t have
the luxury of adding a dedicated space for a wiring panel. In these cases, you
have to try to make some part of the house do double duty as your wiring
panel. A first stop is the place where your cable, telephone, and electrical
connections currently come into the house. You can mount some plywood on
the wall on which to mount your gear. Here are some other places to consider
locating your wiring panel:
25
Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home

 The utility or laundry room: The biggest disadvantage of this location
is the potential for high humidity, so make sure your clothes dryer is
well ventilated to the outdoors. Good ventilation also keeps all the dust
and lint from your dryer out of your sensitive electronics.
 A protected garage: The potential for dust and extreme temperatures
may make this location less than optimal for some homes, but the
garage can be a useful location.
 The basement: Many people choose the basement for a central wiring
node because it’s easy to run wires through a drop ceiling. The basement
can be a very good location, but keep in mind that basements can be
both dusty and damp.
 A weather-protected outdoor panel: We recommend this location only
as a last resort, but it could be acceptable in a place with a mild climate.
We wouldn’t recommend putting any active electronics, such as
Ethernet hubs or phone systems, out here.
An important thing to keep in mind is that the natural enemies of electrical
and electronic equipment are moisture, dust, and temperature extremes. So
locations that may work for someone in Florida or California may not make as
much sense for your house in Maine.
Setting up a hub
Your home’s wiring panel provides a centralized place for all sorts of whole-
home networks that connect into your home theater (and elsewhere). Within
your home theater, wherever you happen to locate it, you also need a similar
centralized connection point for all that A/V gear we discuss in Chapter 1.
For most people, central to this area is the A/V receiver. An important thing
to consider up front is the capability of this receiver to act as the hub of your
home theater. An A/V receiver should be capable of accepting the connections
from just about every single piece of A/V gear in your home theater (with the
exception, perhaps, of an HDTV tuner/set-top box) and providing a central
connection and control point.
With the right pieces and parts and the right approach to making connections,
your A/V receiver (or surround sound decoder/controller, if you go with 
separate components) should be the primary connection point in a home
theater. With a small number of exceptions (mainly related to HDTV), you
shouldn’t connect components directly to the TV or display unit. All your
audio and video should be routed through the A/V receiver, which then
switches — or distributes — these signals to your speakers and display. We
discuss receivers in more detail in Chapter 11.
26
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

Switching is a cool concept that we want to make sure you understand. If you
think of your receiver as a generic box with lots of cables coming into and
going out of it, the switching capability of the device merely cross connects
these lines. So let’s say you have a Sony PlayStation 2, an AudioReQuest audio
CD server (with video output to the TV screen to select your CDs), a DVD
player, a VCR, and a TiVo personal video recorder all connected to your A/V
receiver, which in turn is connected to your display. In the past, you would
have to link these in a daisy chain and press TV/Video buttons and L1/L2
channel selectors and the link in order to see what you want on the TV. 
With an A/V receiver with video switching onboard, you can switch among
these different video sources by merely turning a knob on the receiver or
pressing a button on the remote. Simple as that. No more fudging, cursing, and
screaming by your spouse that Desperate Housewives has already started and
you’d better get the TV working now! (Not that that ever happened to Pat.)
Some folks feel that sending any video through the receiver’s video switching
circuitry slightly degrades the quality of this video. We think that, unless
you’re talking about a really high-end HDTV system, you probably won’t see
the difference. If you’re worried about your receiver degrading your video
quality, try it both ways (with the source device connected through the
receiver and connected directly to your display) and see which looks better
to your eyes.
Discreetly installing all this whole-home wiring (and “local” cables within
your home theater) for your home theater can be a bit problematic and
messy. Your home theater room, unlike your wiring panel, is meant to be a
public space in your house, not a place where you can hide away unsightly
bundles of wire and racks of equipment. So your aesthetic requirements will
be a bit higher.
The best solution to this problem is to design the room so that you have an
enclosed equipment-and-connection area where you can put the equipment
that you don’t need to physically access to watch a program or listen to 
something — such as special equipment needed for whole-home audio and
video systems. Your equipment and connection area could be a well-ventilated
closet, if one is available. We’ve even seen really sophisticated setups with a
false wall behind the TV and equipment racks to allow access to the backs of
all of the gear (or that have pull-out shelves that give you easy access to the
back, as well). If you have space for a rack, you can probably store a lot of
your active components there, too.
If you can’t find a separate space for your gear, you can at least make your
environment neater and more professional-looking by hiding some of the
wiring in the walls or in fake molding and by making the local connections
available via wall outlets. You can use short cables to connect these outlets
to the equipment itself. In this fashion, you don’t have lumpy wires traveling
under the rugs and cables that little children (or the dog) can easily grab.
27
Chapter 2: Defining Your Home-Theatered Home

Zoning inside your home
When most people think about a home theater, they think within a pretty 
confined box — the place where the home theater is going to be. And certainly,
that’s the predominant focus of this book.
However, a major theme that we’ll hammer at (until you agree with us) is that
you should spend a little extra money and be a little smarter in your planning
so that you can access this great asset elsewhere around the house and from
the Internet as well.
Creating zones around your house is a great way to extend your audio asset.
When you buy your receiver or amplifier, the concept of multizone is going to
come up. A multizone system allows you to access different sources and send
them to independent outputs simultaneously. For example, your kids could
be watching Rugrats in the living room, and you could be listening to Dunne
Roman (www.dunneroman.com) in the kitchen. How cool is that!
We don’t go into a lot of detail on this here; we cover it extensively in Chapter 18.
But we want to mention it up front for the following reasons:
 This is a good reason why you are going to need to think outside just
your home theater (and another reason why a wiring panel is a good
idea).
 This is something you need to plan and budget for. Multizone means
extra wiring and cables, extra speakers, possibly an extra amplifier, 
possibly extra controls, and some extra cost. (But it’s well worth it.)
Doing It Yourself versus Hiring the Pros
A lot of home theater you can do yourself. However, if you want it done right,
you may want to bring in some experts to complement your work. If you don’t
have the right electrical outlets at your desired electronics station, for instance,
you might call in an electrical contractor to put in dedicated home-run 
electrical cables (so you’re not on the same circuit as the dishwasher and
don’t have electrical current spikes hitting your system all the time). Also,
setting up front projection is an art and better left to professionals. And there’s
nothing like having your system fine-tuned by a professional who really can
tell if your video and sound are just right. Still, you can do all of this yourself,
with some patience (and respect for the live conductors in your electrical
system).
28
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

If you want a professional to set up your entire system, you probably need to
shop in the high-end price range. We rarely see anyone brought in to help on
systems less than $10,000, and it almost always takes a $25,000+ system to
get most contractors excited. So if you are on the low end of the equation,
you’ll probably do a lot yourself or rely heavily on the local installation services
of the store from which you buy your equipment. Even if your dealer doesn’t
want to do the entire installation for you, we suggest you see if they can do a
system calibration for you. If you buy on-line, expect to do most of the work
yourself.
Home Theater For Dummies does not presume you are going to hire anyone.
You should be able to plan, design, and install a very professional sounding
(and looking) home theater system after reading this book. We just want you
to know your alternatives in case you get halfway through and need some
help. Check out the sidebar, “Who can help if you need it?” for some ideas.
Which people get involved in your project depends on the size of your pro-
ject and whether you are building a new home, renovating an old one, or
simply making do with that spare room in the basement. In the end, it will
vary according to what you’re trying to accomplish. If you plan to put a major
home theater in your home — complete with theater seats, a popcorn and
candy stand, and screen curtains — you may want to bring a home-theater
consultant into the process. However, we’ve seen some very imaginative do-
it-yourself (DIY) home theaters that trade love and patience for consultants
and big bills, and the results are truly amazing.
Want some confidence that you can do this (and get some neat ideas for your
own installation)? Check out all the DIY home theater projects at www.
hometheatertalk.com and www.hometheaterforum.com.
If you do bring in some help, make sure that you choose advisors who share
your vision of an ideal home theater. The people you choose should have
experience with a broad range of home theaters, not just expensive or cheap
ones. Find your home theater personality and match it with your contractor’s,
and you’ll have a winning combination.
You might have a hard time finding some of these contractors. For the more
traditional groups of professionals (such as architects), we tend to rely on
word of mouth, recommendations from in-the-know friends, and a thorough
review of the contractor’s references. For contractors who will be installing
your home’s electronics and wiring infrastructure, we do these same things,
as well as check their credentials. The Custom Electronics Design & Installation
Association, or CEDIA, has a rigorous training and qualification program for
people who do nothing but build and install home theater systems for a
living. There is a CEDIA Finder Service at www.cedia.net/homeowners/
finder.php. Many home theater magazine Web sites also have directories
of contractors — for instance, you can find a listing of installers at Electronic
House’s Installers Guide: www.electronichouse.com/installer.

Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
Who can help if you need it?
All sorts of people can help you if you need
advice:
 Architect: If you’re building or renovating,
an architect is probably involved. Home 
theater design usually isn’t an architect’s
strong suit, but he or she can help you 
lay out the initial plans for your home and
coordinate with other designers to get their
respective visions on paper.
 Audio/video consultant: Your audio/video
(A/V) consultant helps you select the right
mix of components for your sight and sound
systems and then integrates all those com-
ponents. Your A/V consultant makes sure
that the appropriate wiring is run to support
your installations and then installs the gear
when you’re ready. If you’re installing 
a dedicated home theater, expect your A/V
consultant to get involved with the architect
early on, too, making recommendations 
for room sizes, building materials, and so on.
The A/V consultant may also hand you off 
to a specialized home theater consultant 
if the job is too complex for his or her 
comfort. (Home theater consultants get into
additional details, such as soundproofing,
seating, lighting, and the room’s shape and
construction.)
 Contractor/builder: The general contractor/
builder’s role is to direct the other specialty
contractors and make sure that they carry out
the intent of the designers. Passing correct
information from one contractor (such as
the home theater consultant) to the people
doing the work (such as the cabinetmaker
who builds the home theater cabinetry) is
crucial. The details are what count here,
such as cutting out the right size cubbyhole
for the kitchen media center.
 Computer systems contractor: If you work at
home or have complex computer-networking
needs, bringing in a computer systems
contractor to network your computer hard-
ware and interface it to the appropriate 
systems can be a great timesaver.
 Electrical contractor: Your home theater
may require additional or different electrical
wiring (for example, running dedicated
electrical wiring to your media center).
 Home networking consultant: Your home
networking consultant will help you create a
wired and/or wireless computer network that
can carry voice, data, and video all over your
home. Many alarm companies, electricians,
and others are expanding their services to
include home networking. We’re big believers
in home networking and think it should be 
a core part of your home theater, too. These
folks can also help with a whole-home
automation system that can control your
home theater and automate things like light-
ing, drapes, and even movie screens.
 Interior designer: This person is responsible
for making sure that your home theater
technology doesn’t stick out like a sore
thumb. Installing a state-of-the-art home-
entertainment center in the living room is
one thing; making it fit with the overall
scheme of your home is another.
 Lighting consultant: Often an overlooked
task on a to-do list, lighting design has 
an important effect on the ambiance of 
your home theater, so consider specialized
lighting in key accent areas.
Whew! Did we leave anyone out? Depending on
the amount of money you want to spend, you
may indeed have this many people making your
home theater a reality. A more modest project
has a more modest number of people stomping
around your house. Also, many of the previously
mentioned professionals — A/V designers, for
example — include their services when you
purchase their equipment.

n the early days of corporate video conferencing, system designers strug-
gled to balance the audio and video needs for a video conference with the
cost for the transmission to carry the signals (which was really expensive).
Necessity being the mother of invention, a lot of the focus was on compress-
ing the audio and video to low sizes and figuring out the right mix between
the two.
One trend became clear rather quickly: When test subjects were presented
with all the different variants and permutations possible for different trans-
mission speeds, they always preferred to have better audio at the price of
video rather than the opposite. In other words, they preferred to accept
crappy video rather than deal with bad audio.
Although you’d like to have the best of all possible worlds in all aspects of
your home theater, we think you’ll probably focus on audio first (at least we’d
recommend it) for three reasons:
 The video conferencing effect we just noted.
 The fact that your home theater also doubles as a home concert hall, so
you want your audio CDs, MP3s, and other audio sources to sound per-
fect, too.
 Video display prices are dropping faster than any other device in home
theater, so if you are going to put off one purchase, putting off the video
display makes a lot of sense.
For these reasons, we start our discussion of home theater technologies with
audio first.

Surrounding Yourself with Sound
Unless you plan on installing a 360-degree Cinema-in-the-Round screen in your
home, just like you’d see at Disney World, video plays a rather confined (but
still big) role in creating the home theater illusion of being “in the movie.” The
real job of surrounding yourself in the scene falls to your multichannel sur-
round sound audio system.
Imagine that you see on the screen in front of you the soon-to-be victims of a
firing squad, and that — from behind you — you hear the clicks of the rifles as
they chamber a round. That sensation is brought to you by your rear-channel-
driven surround sound system. Now, if you had heard that sound coming from
in front of you — the traditional TV experience — it simply would not have the
same impact because, in the “real” world, that click of the rifle would have to
come from behind you. Which all goes to show that if you really want the dick-
ens scared out of you, you need surround sound.
Two-channel sound versus multichannel
surround sound
Most of us are used to age-old two-channel sound — that is, the stereo sound
that gives us a left and a right speaker effect. Multichannel surround sound
builds on this by adding a front center speaker between the front left and
right speakers and adding two surround speakers. More recent versions of
surround sound add even more rear speakers and side surround speakers to
really enhance your surround sound field (the latest version of Dolby Lab’s
surround sound — Dolby TrueHD — can support up to 14 channels!). A sub-
woofer is part of almost all home theater setups, but as we discuss later in
this chapter, a subwoofer is actually more a part of the bass management 
of the collective speakers than part of the surround sound system itself.
Nonetheless, something needs to shake the room when the dinosaur’s feet
stomp the jeep in Jurassic Park!
To understand the impact of the concept of surround sound on your home
theater, you need to understand a bit about encoding and decoding sound.
When the master mixers at the movie studios create the audio track to go
with the movie, they encode the music in some very specific ways. They des-
ignate which channel (you can read speaker into that if you like) the specific
sound goes through. In addition, each different channel is designed to pro-
vide spatial sound effects — meaning that the channels can work together to
make sounds come from different locations relative to you, the listener. The
goal is to decode those signals onto the correct channels to replicate the
studio’s intent.

Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

So, let’s say that a squadron of jets in a scene from Top Gun is doing a fly-by
of the carrier command bridge. If we were in the command bridge, we would
hear the jets come in from the left, sweep across in front of us, and then dis-
appear to the right and the rear as they turn off to the starboard side of the
ship. If you are sitting in a well-tuned home theater, you should hear no differ-
ently. And in fact, as the bridge shakes, your subwoofers (and bass shakers,
which we talk about in Chapter 22) provide you with the vibrations to make
you feel like you are actually there. Now we’re talking surround sound!
To get you to this point, the encoders have to designate on the movie or TV
program soundtrack the specific sounds that, at specific times, are to be sent
to specific channels in your system. The speakers connected to those chan-
nels are given those signals by your surround sound–equipped A/V receiver
(see Chapter 11), which properly decodes those tracks from the DVD or
other video source. A home theater audio system needs to have it all correct
from beginning to end.
In a two-channel system, you might hear some of that effect, in that it might
get the left and right part right. A two-channel system can’t help with the
front to back movement, however, and that’s the critical part of a surround
sound system — it surrounds you!
Understanding surround sound lingo
For the most part, the entertainment industry boils down a lot of the sur-
round sound terminology into numbers like 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1. Sometimes these
numbers refer to the playback system’s speaker configuration, and some-
times they refer to the audio signal format being delivered. The lingo can be
confusing, especially when the number of speakers in your particular system
doesn’t match the number of channels in your source — like when you play
back a 5.1 channel recording on your 7.1 channel system — but it’s all per-
fectly normal for that to occur. In these numbers, the first number represents
the number of speakers or main audio channels involved, and the 1 or 0 after
the decimal point indicates whether the system has a subwoofer or supports
a low-frequency effects channel. Systems that end in 1 have a subwoofer or
an effects channel.
Here’s a rundown of the different numbers you’ll probably encounter and
what they mean:
 2.0: Normal stereo — the kind with a left and a right channel — is 2.0 in
surround sound speak.
 5.1: This is the primary format for creating and delivering surround
sound. It is in wide use in movie theaters, digital television, DVD-Video
and Audio, and even the latest game consoles. Source signals have the
five main channels and one LFE (low frequency effects) bass channel.
Playback systems usually have five main speakers and one subwoofer.
33
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

 5.1-channel-ready: Such an audio system has six discrete inputs to
accept a 5.1 signal from a signal source such as a 5.1-channel DVD
player. It does not necessarily mean these products can actually decode
signals to a 5.1-channel output. The best way to ferret out true 5.1 sys-
tems is by reading reviews of the devices before you buy. (We recom-
mend many places to find these reviews in Chapter 23.)
 6.1: 6.1-channel systems have an additional surround channel called the
back surround channel. This drives a speaker (or preferably two) situ-
ated right behind the viewers, in essence providing the same smooth
flow in the back sound field that the center speaker enables in the front
speaker group. Dozens of DVDs are encoded with extra back surround
information for this back surround speaker, and these DVDs also play
perfectly well on regular 5.1 systems.
 7.1: Not to be outdone, some have taken the 5.1 or 6.1 channel encoding
on a DVD and used some computer horsepower to create two indepen-
dent back surround speakers for even more surround sound, making 
it 7.1. Note that 7.1 is not a true discrete surround sound format (there
are no DVDs on the market with 7.1 channels of sound), but instead, it
refers to manufacturers’ own systems used to derive two back surround
channels from existing stereo, 5.1, or even the 6.1-channel sources just
mentioned.
 8.1 and beyond: You’ll probably hear about even higher designations,
8.1, 9.1, 10.2, and so on. These are truly in the realm of the home theater-
phile, and if you’re evaluating such gear, a home theater consultant is
probably standing next to you, so just follow his or her recommenda-
tions. The newest systems (like Dolby Digital Plus, discussed later in 
the chapter) can theoretically support systems up to 13.1. Wow!
Bass management
Bass management is how your home theater manages low-frequency sounds.
Better A/V receivers and other controller devices have several options for
how to handle the bass sounds in your system. If you have nice, big main
speakers that have a very effective bass range of their own (often called full-
range speakers), you might pass all bass frequencies to them. If you want
smaller speakers that can sit on a shelf or hang on the wall alongside your
plasma TV, then the bass frequencies might fall to the subwoofer, which is 
a speaker designed to play low-frequency sounds.
One area that causes a lot of confusion is the difference between the Low
Frequency Effect channel (LFE), which is part of your movie/game/TV show
soundtrack and the physical subwoofer channel on your receiver or ampli-
fier. The LFE channel is encoded in the soundtrack of a DVD or other sur-
round sound source; the subwoofer channel is the connection on the back of
34
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

your A/V receiver that provides amplified low-frequency sound signals to
your subwoofer. The LFE channel is encoded in surround sound material —
it’s the “.l” in 5.1 and other surround sound formats. This low frequency
sound, along with the bass from any channels that cannot be reproduced by
the “small” main speakers, is often sent to the subwoofer channel in your sur-
round sound system, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be sent exclusively to
your subwoofer. For example, some people send these low frequency sounds
to both the subwoofer and to the front left and right speakers if said speakers
are “large.” The bass management system within your A/V receiver (or A/V
controller) lets you customize these settings to best fit your A/V system. (We
discuss how to set this all up in Chapters 19 and 20.)
You don’t have to have a subwoofer to take advantage of the LFE channel
because many normal left/right speakers can take these cues from your
receiver and play the sound accordingly. But having a subwoofer gives you
that stomach-rattling, vibrating-room effect at just the right times — an effect
we’re sure you’ll want to take advantage of.
Dolby Galore
Here’s where surround sound gets complicated, unfortunately. A host of dif-
ferent terms and brand names are applied to everything we just described,
and these terms can get downright confusing.
When you start to optimize your home theater, however, you need to under-
stand these terms. Because you probably have some older gear in your home
audio and video system already, and because some older movies use older
encoding schemes, we mention older terms, too, so that you can have the big
picture.
We start with Dolby Laboratories (www.dolby.com). You’ve probably seen
Dolby on your cassette tape deck for years and seen advertisements for
Dolby Digital at the beginning of movies. But you’ve probably never known
exactly what Dolby does. Well, stand by, because we’re going to make you
look smart on your next date at the movies.
Dolby surround sound
You have to go back a few years to get to where we are today. Although Dolby
has been enhancing sound for decades, the true mother of all surround
sound encoding schemes is Dolby Surround (introduced in 1982), which
encodes four analog audio channels into two channels for storage and/or
35
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

transmission. If you play Dolby Surround on a normal stereo, you get two
channels. If you play it on a Dolby Surround–enabled decoder device, the
device separates the full four channels for playback. Over 40 million con-
sumer products have been shipped with Dolby Surround Pro Logic (the 
current version of this system) decoding onboard. That’s a lot.
With Dolby Surround, the four channels encode front left, front center, front
right, and monophonic surround as their channels. The left, center, and right
channels are full-range channels, meaning that they carry the full range (20 Hz
to 20 kHz) of audio frequencies. The fourth (rear) surround sound channel is
a limited bandwidth channel, meaning it carries only a subset of the frequency
range (not the real low-frequency or high-frequency stuff).
At first, consumer audio/video receivers with Dolby Surround decoders could
separate only the left, right, and monophonic surround speaker channels.
However, with the advent of Dolby Pro Logic in 1987, receivers could decode
the center channel as well. The consumer devices just took awhile to develop
the same processing power that the more expensive movie theaters had
onboard.
Dolby Pro Logic is what’s called a matrixed multichannel system, meaning
that output channels are electronically derived from input channels. None of
the four outputs are identical to the two inputs that are used to transport the
encoded signals, but all the signals being output from the decoder are indeed
present in the two-channel source — nothing new, such as reverb, is being
added.
So with Dolby Pro Logic, you have four channels and five speakers, with the
two surround speakers playing essentially the same monophonic sound. You
often see a subwoofer channel on Pro Logic receivers as well; note that this is
not a separate channel, but is derived from the low-frequency information
from the front channels.
One problem with the dual monophonic surround sound channels is that, in
some ways, they defeat the purpose of having surround sound. You can’t
send information specifically to one speaker, as is done with a left or right
front speaker. And because they have the same signal, they tend to create a
localized sound field between the speakers — and that goes against surround
sound’s goal of creating a large, diffuse background sound field. Proper place-
ment of the surround speakers on the side walls aiming across the listening
area helps achieve the optimal results. (In Chapter 12, we discuss dipole
speakers and how they can help with this.)
A newer version of Pro Logic, Dolby Pro Logic II, came out in 2001. The
biggest new feature that Pro Logic II offers is a fuller sound experience for
two-channel stereo or Dolby Surround–encoded sources that were being
36
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

played over 5.1 channel systems. Pro Logic II does extra processing and
extends the Pro Logic work substantially. Importantly, Pro Logic II decodes
the surround sound speakers in full bandwidth stereo, and therefore provides
a more complete rear sound field.
Just about all surround sound decoders sold since 2002 or so support Dolby
Pro Logic II. Many now support an even newer and more advanced version of
Pro Logic — Pro Logic IIx, discussed below.
Dolby Pro Logic turns 7 (point 1!)
As more and more folks build 7.1-channel home theaters to support Dolby
Digital EX (discussed in the next section), they find that they have two chan-
nels that aren’t being used when they view material that’s not multichannel
encoded (for example, many DVDs of older material have a simple 2.0 chan-
nel Dolby Digital soundtrack), or even when playing regular stereo content.
In order to fill all seven speakers with sound, Dolby’s engineers came to the
rescue with a new version of Dolby Pro Logic II called Pro Logic IIx. This system
provides a full 6.1- or 7.1-channel output — meaning you can take any incoming
stereo (2.0) or 5.1-channel signal and turn it into a 6.1- or 7.1-channel output
that uses all of the speakers in your home theater system. So don’t be afraid to
go 7.1! Pro Logic IIx has come to your rescue!
Dolby Digital arrives on the scene
The advent of Dolby Digital in 1997 really started to make things interesting.
As you would surmise, Dolby Digital is an all-digital surround format that han-
dles audio compression, so it’s available only for digital content. DVDs and
HDTV use Dolby Digital (DVDs may also contain some other system, such as
DTS). To give you an idea of Dolby Digital’s reach into the market, by the
beginning of 2006, more than one billion consumer devices had shipped with
Dolby Digital onboard, and more than 7,600 films had been encoded in Dolby
Digital. It should come as no surprise, then, that it’s the scheme we think
your equipment should support.
Dolby Digital 5.1 represents the current minimum level of performance that
you should require from your system. Also keep in mind that any receiver
with Dolby Digital decoding can also decode Dolby Surround Pro Logic.
37
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

While Dolby Digital is the more widely known consumer moniker, it also goes
by the more techie name of AC-3, which is actually the name used within the
official part of the DVD video standard (for “regular” non-HD-DVDs), as well
as the ATSC standard for DTV and HDTV. (See Chapter 4 for more on this.)
AC-3 is also part of the standards for HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs. As you can
see, Dolby Digital is everywhere, and you definitely want your home theater
gear to support it. Luckily, just about every home theater receiver built since
the late ’90s supports Dolby Digital.
What’s so great about Dolby Digital is that it encodes six discrete audio 
channels. (Discrete means that the sound signal contained in each of the six
available channels is distinct and independent from each of the others.)
Remember that the older Dolby Surround encoded four channels onto two-
channel soundtracks, and that often resulted in all sorts of bleed-overs
between channels and less than clear demarcations in the sound details.
Because Dolby Digital has six clean channels, your receivers and controllers
can precisely control the different elements of your sound mix. More impor-
tantly, the rear surround speakers are each fed by their own independent
channels, enabling true spatial separation for that rear sound field. With this
setup, when you hear that bullet whiz by or that starship warp overhead, the
sound moving across your entire speaker system is smooth and controlled —
and digital. This is the home theater your momma always warned you about!
Dolby’s ability to encode and decode information is only as strong as its
source data. If it is working with a two-channel stereo movie, then you may
see something like “Dolby Digital 2.0” on the package, designating that it is 
a stereo signal being encoded and decoded using Dolby Digital. All fine and
dandy, but it’s still a stereo signal. However, if your receiver includes Dolby
Pro Logic, Dolby Pro Logic II, or even Dolby Pro Logic IIx, the stereo signal on
the disc can still be listened to as a multichannel surround signal, thereby
allowing you to achieve full playback on your system.
We talk more about how your DVD, HDTV, and other gear supports Dolby
Digital, and how to make sure it is all set correctly, in later chapters, notably
Chapter 6. For now, know that this is the baseline upon which you grow.
Dolby Digital Surround EX
Rear surround speakers are a relatively new development made possible by
an additional surround channel that drives the center rear surround speaker.
This is 6.1 in industry parlance. Dolby avoids 6.1 and calls it Dolby Digital
Surround EX.
38
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

The rear Surround EX channel does not have its own discrete channel. Instead,
its signal is matrixed in (intermixed) with the left and right surround channels,
just like Dolby Pro Logic has the center speaker information encoded in the left
and right front channels. When a Dolby Digital EX program is decoded, the
three surround outputs are all derived from a 3-channel Pro Logic process —
none of them are strictly discrete anymore. It is also the case that many con-
ventional 5.1 movies decode nicely with Dolby Digital EX processing, thus
keeping the added back speakers active. Newer processors offer Pro Logic IIx
technology, thereby deriving four separate surround outputs instead of three,
making much more effective use of 7.1-speaker systems for all movie and music
programs, whether Surround EX encoded or not.
The first consumer devices with Surround EX were based on licenses from
Lucasfilm THX (www.thx.com), so you’ll also see it called THX Surround EX
in stores and on-line when you’re doing some shopping.
THX isn’t a surround sound format itself, but rather a certification and testing
program for home (and movie) theater equipment and movies. So equipment
like A/V receivers and speakers may be THX-certified, as may DVDs them-
selves. THX’s main mission in life is to create a set of standards for surround
sound playback and to then certify that equipment or DVDs meet those stan-
dards. A big part of these standards revolves around THX’s criteria for the
levels and equalization of the sound sent to the surround speakers.
Many newer DVDs are encoded for Dolby Digital EX and have that extra chan-
nel of surround information onboard. Also, if you’re playing a regular Dolby
Digital 5.1-channel DVD, a THX Ultra 2 decoder can simulate 6.1- or 7.1-channel
surround by processing the audio information in the regular surround chan-
nels and sending the information to your rear surround speaker.
If you’re playing a movie (say on a DVD) that has been encoded using Dolby
Digital EX, and you have only a regular Dolby Digital decoder in your A/V
receiver, you won’t have any problems. You still get the full 5.1 surround
sound you expect, with nothing missing. You just won’t get certain sounds 
re-routed to the extra surround speakers behind you.
DTS: Bring It On!
Dolby is not the only game in town, although it clearly has the lead in the
marketplace. Digital Theater Systems (DTS) has invented a competing lineup
of surround sound encoding schemes. The first movie to use DTS was
Jurassic Park.
39
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

As with Dolby Digital, DTS Digital Surround provides 5.1 channels of digital
audio. However, DTS uses less compression (higher data rate) than Dolby
Digital. Where Dolby Digital encodes six channels with 384,000 or 448,000 
bits per second, DTS, in its higher quality mode, encodes 1,536,000 bits per
second, which many audiophiles believe delivers a better sound quality. Of
course, that means that the DTS encoding takes up more space on a DVD, so
the DVD doesn’t have as much room for extra features, such as foreign lan-
guages, commentaries, and multiple versions of the movie.
It’s an open question among experts as to which technology (Dolby Digital or
DTS) sounds better or is a better choice. On the one hand, people point to
DTS’s higher bit rate and say, “Aha! Better sound!” Others say, “Well, Dolby 
is just more efficient at encoding sound, so it can have just as good a sound
quality with fewer bits.” You know what? It’s really a moot point. Both can
sound good. You’ll most likely use whatever’s encoded on the DVD or other
programming you watch. Dolby is the most prevalent system, but DTS is also
widespread. We suggest you choose receivers and other equipment that sup-
port both standards.
The DVD powers that be require all NTSC (the North American standard)
DVDs to carry either a Dolby Digital or a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation — a
common digital audio format) soundtrack to ensure compatibility with all
DVD players. Because DTS is an optional feature of DVDs, DTS has an uphill
battle getting studios onboard because the space on DVDs is limited. (For
these space reasons, most DVDs containing a DTS soundtrack are encoded at
half the 1.536 Mbps rate mentioned above in order to retain sufficient bit rate
for high-quality video and other content.) Today, a few hundred DVDs are
issued with the higher-quality (1.536 Mbps rate) DTS Digital Surround.
You might hear of some other DTS innovations:
 DTS-ES: DTS-ES Discrete uses existing digital multichannel technology 
to deliver the 5.1 channels of regular DTS. It also adds a discrete full-
bandwidth back surround channel — meaning that each channel is indi-
vidually encoded rather than being matrix decoded from the others.
That additional channel may be played through one or two speakers,
allowing for the ES — Extended Surround — that gives DTS-ES its name.
More prevalent is the DTS-ES Matrix system, which is electrically identi-
cal to Dolby Digital EX but uses Neo:6 matrix decoding to derive the
three surround outputs.
 DTS Neo:6: DTS Neo:6 Music and Neo:6 Cinema are decoding techniques
for stereo or Dolby Surround–encoded, two-channel sources. Neo:6
Music keeps the front left and right channels intact while synthesizing
the center and surround channels from the two-channel source. Neo:6
Cinema can create a 6.1-channel signal from two-channel movie sources.
40
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

The bottom line on DTS is that the DTS folks have some innovative algo-
rithms, but the sheer prevalence of the Dolby solutions clearly makes Dolby
Digital the most common choice for studios and home theater enthusiasts.
Most A/V receivers offer both DTS and Dolby Digital options, so you can try
them both and set your receiver (or choose your DVDs) to your preference.
Understanding the Next Generation 
of Surround Sound
The Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES surround sound formats that bring 6.1- (or
7.1-) channel sound to your home theater are really great. But time marches
on, technology improves, and surround sound keeps getting better. So it
should come as no surprise that both companies have something new up
their sleeves.
The advent of improved digital connections between disc players or set-top
boxes and the receiver (connections like HDMI) and the enhanced data
capacities of entirely new formats of recorded high-definition content (HD-
DVD and Blu-ray) have made it possible for Dolby and DTS to launch new and
improved surround sound formats that promise more channels, purer sound,
and an improved surround sound experience.
None of the three new surround sound formats we discuss below are widely
available yet — mainly because the high-definition DVD formats that will sup-
port them are not on the market as we write. (That’s our way of breaking the
bad news that, while all the formats are pretty much ready to go — so much
so that we’ve managed to be blown away by them in demos and in labs —
they’re not really available to normal consumers yet.) Good things do come
to those who wait, however.
Dolby Digital Plus
The folks at Dolby Laboratories have improved their super-popular Dolby
Digital/Dolby Digital EX system and have created Dolby Digital Plus. Dolby
Digital Plus improves upon Dolby Digital and EX by
 Increasing the bit rate: Dolby Digital Plus can be encoded with up to
6144 Kbps (kilobits per second) of data, where Dolby Digital tops out 
at 640 Kbps. (448 Kbps is the maximum from current formats, however.)
In Chapter 5, we point out that higher bit rates, all else being equal,
mean better sound quality because the audio signals need to be com-
pressed less.
41
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

 Improving the encoding: Not only does Dolby Digital Plus provide a
much higher bit rate, it also does a better job of encoding (or digitizing
and compressing) sound. This means that, at a given bit rate, you get
better sound quality. Combine this with the vastly increased bit rate of
Dolby Digital Plus, and you get great sound!
 Adding more channels: Dolby Digital Plus can provide up to 13.1 dis-
crete channels of sound (14 total speakers, including the subwoofer).
You can really envelop yourself in the action with 14 speakers!
 Providing backward compatibility: Dolby Digital Plus decoders can
automatically downconvert your sound to the older Dolby Digital for-
mats. So you can play Dolby Digital Plus programs on your older system
without having to buy any new hardware. And when you do upgrade,
you gain all of the advantages mentioned above. Because the conversion
process from Dolby Digital Plus to Dolby Digital outputs a 640 Kbps
Dolby Digital stream, your existing system, which normally tops out at
448 Kbps, can actually sound better than ever before.
One drawback of Dolby Digital Plus is that the very high bit rates it supports
overwhelm the digital audio connections that are traditionally used to con-
nect DVD players or set-top boxes to your receiver. If all you have on your
receiver is coaxial or optical digital connections, you’ll still be able to listen
to Dolby Digital Plus, but you’ll have to get by with using analog audio con-
nections or by letting your DVD player downconvert to 640 Kbps Dolby
Digital. In the future, receivers with HDMI or FireWire (IEEE 1394) connections
won’t have this restriction, and you’ll get the full Dolby Digital Plus experi-
ence because the decoded signals can be carried as multichannel PCM over
these high-bandwidth interfaces without sonic compromise.
As we write, no receivers have the right HDMI or FireWire connections to
handle Dolby Digital Plus digital bitstream connections from a disc player to
the receiver. Luckily, new HD-DVD or Blu-ray players should have the appro-
priate circuitry to handle Dolby Digital Plus internally and send the decoded
signal to your receiver via analog outputs, as a high-quality Dolby Digital
output your receiver can handle, or as high-resolution PCM via HDMI.
Dolby Digital Plus is a mandatory format for HD-DVD and is optional for Blu-
ray, so any player you buy for one of these formats should support Dolby
Digital Plus. Dolby Digital Plus may also be used for other HDTV content —
and may end up being encoded in a lot of the HDTV shows you get from your
cable, satellite, or other TV service provider.
HD-DVD and Blu-ray are first being launched with a limitation of 7.1-channel
audio as a maximum, so you won’t have that 13.1-channel sound we teased you
with for a while. But the format can eventually grow into this many channels.
42
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

Dolby TrueHD
Dolby’s other new format — one that gets us really excited! — is Dolby TrueHD.
Like Dolby Digital Plus, this format can support up to 13.1 channels of surround
sound goodness.
The big difference is that Dolby TrueHD is a lossless format. That means that
the sound being encoded into the Dolby TrueHD data stream will come out the
far end (at the decoder in your home theater) exactly the same as it went in. For
the first time ever, the home consumer will be able to experience multichannel
movie soundtracks exactly as they were heard in the mixing studio during con-
tent production. Most of the other surround sound formats we’ve discussed
(all of them, in fact, except for DTS-HD Master Audio, which we discuss in 
the next section) are lossy — some data is discarded in the compression/
decompression process. With Dolby TrueHD, the audio track is bit-for-bit 
identical to the studio master.
Dolby TrueHD uses the same MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoding as
DVD-Audio (which we discuss in Chapter 5), but with an even higher bit rate,
which allows for more channels of high-resolution audio.
A lossy encoding system throws away bits of the audio (using sophisticated
acoustic modeling that determines what your ears actually do and don’t
hear) in order to achieve greater compression of the audio. Greater compres-
sion is a good thing if you have a limited amount of storage space on a disc or
a limited amount of bandwidth (or data throughput) on your video transmis-
sion system (like cable or satellite). But if you have the space (or the band-
width) — like Blu-ray and HD-DVD do — then you can compress your audio
less and get better sound quality.
You probably won’t hear Dolby TrueHD on any broadcast HDTV program-
ming any time soon because of the bandwidth issues we just mentioned, but
Dolby TrueHD support is mandatory for HD-DVD systems and is optional for
Blu-ray. So you’ll be able to enjoy some really awesome lossless surround
sound when you watch a movie on one of these new disc formats.
Like Dolby Digital Plus, to listen to Dolby TrueHD, you’ll either need to use an
HDMI or a FireWire connector to your receiver (these are still pretty rare as
we write) or have a Dolby TrueHD decoder inside your DVD player and use
analog connections to your receiver.
DTS-HD
The folks at DTS have developed their own lossless surround sound format
known as DTS-HD Master Audio. DTS-HD is an optional format on both Blu-ray
43
Chapter 3: The ABCs of Home Theater Audio

and HD-DVD and can provide (to begin with) up to 7.1 channels of lossless
surround sound when it’s used with one of these discs.
DTS-HD has the great feature of being backward compatible with the older
variants of DTS. So while you will need a DTS-HD decoder to gain the full ben-
efits of the lossless encoding that DTS-HD provides, you can still get great
sound with your existing gear.
In fact, a DTS-HD-encoded HD-DVD or Blu-ray disc — when connected to 
an existing DTS-capable receiver — will be able to send a relatively high bit
rate (1536 Kbps) surround signal to any existing DTS receiver. And while this
same bit rate has been used on hundreds of conventional DVDs, this is about
twice the bit rate of the average DVDs using DTS encoding, providing a good
boost in sound quality.
Of course, when you have a DTS-HD decoder in the loop (we expect that DTS-
HD-capable receivers will be shipping in the middle of 2006), you’ll get that
great lossless decoding and superb sound quality.
Other Key Audio Standards
In the realm of “music only” (and yes, we play a lot of music in our systems,
in addition to movies and college basketball games and other video content),
you might hear about a few other audio standards. We don’t spend a ton of
time beating these into your head — mainly because you don’t need to do 
a lot to your system to accommodate them. With the exception of MP3s
(which might take some special gear), these are things that you just plug 
in and they work.
I want my MP3
MP3 is great for on-line music trading and downloading because it uses a
compression scheme to make the files small enough to be easily downloaded.
You don’t find any MP3 music encoded in movies on DVD, nor will you (typi-
cally) find MP3-encoded music in stores. MP3 comes into play when you start
getting involved in on-line music downloading or when you want to move
your CD collection to a computer hard drive. We talk about these activities 
in more detail in Chapter 5.
MP3 is designed to be an efficient encoding system for taking big fat PCM
music files and moving them into download-friendly computer files. MP3
44
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

trades a little sound quality for a lot of room. (It’s another of those lossy com-
pression systems, which means that the system removes some information.)
So MP3 files are typically ten times smaller than the corresponding PCM files
on a compact disc.
In Chapter 5, we discuss computer audio files in greater detail, including an
in-depth discussion of the MP3 and other encoding systems used for these
types of music files — like the AAC files used by Apple’s iTunes and the WMA
files used by Windows Media Player.
PCM is perfect
PCM (or Pulse Code Modulation) is not really perfect — nothing is. But it’s
pretty darn close. PCM is an older (but still vital) system for encoding analog
music into a digital format that can be saved on a computer or “burned” onto
a CD.
We say that PCM is nearly perfect because it’s a lossless coding system, which
means that what goes in comes out exactly the same, bit for bit. In a PCM
world, none of the sound is thrown away. The only limitations to PCM are the
accuracy, sample rate, and word length (the number of bits used to digitally
capture a sound) of the analog-to-digital conversion process, all of which
define the quality of the signal carried in the PCM format. If you have sharp
ears and a good system, PCM-based files sound better than MP3s, for exam-
ple. Traditional CDs are based on PCM, as are the sound files on many com-
puters, such as .wav files on a Windows computer.
PCM isn’t the only lossless system out there. Another one is MLP, or Meridian
Lossless Packing, which is used by the new DVD-Audio format we discuss in
Chapter 5. Another new audio format is the SACD, which we also discuss in
Chapter 5. It uses its own coding format called DSD (or Direct Stream Digital).
You can also find some lossless codecs in the digital music file realm — both
Apple’s Apple Lossless compression system and Microsoft’s Windows Media
Audio Lossless compression system, for example, are lossless formats.
The bottom line here is that for the utmost in digital audio reproduction, loss-
less is the way to go.

e call the video portion of a home theater a display. Your display can
be a direct-view television, a rear-projected television, a front-projected
screen, a plasma or LCD screen, or even a properly painted wall (as long as
you combine it with a projector).
Whatever its form factor, the video aspect of your home theater tends to be
the main focus for many people. Let’s face it — a big-screen display simply
overpowers mere A/V source equipment and controllers. Big screens are just
plain cool!
There’s a lot to know about video formats, though, and in this chapter, we lay the
groundwork for a more detailed discussion of specific video options in Part III.
Learning to Talk Videoese
Before we talk about the different kinds of analog and digital video, it’s worth-
while to find out how to talk about video. Like any other technology, video
has its own set of arcane terms and other jargon that makes casual listeners
just want to give up. We promise not to lay too much on you here, but a few
key concepts are essential:
 Resolution: Speaking in (very) general terms, resolution is basically the
level of detail that your eyes (or a good pair of eyes, if yours have gotten
a little blurry from too much time in front of the computer like ours
have) can resolve (or see) on the screen. In the PC world, this is measured
according to the number of pixels (the individual points of light and
color) on your monitor. For example, older home-PC displays are set to

48
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
show 800 x 600 pixels. Video systems are typically measured by the vertical
number (the smaller of the two) — usually by measuring the scan lines
that move across your screen (from left to right) and by adding up the
number of these lines stacked on top of each other. Video systems 
typically display 480, 720, or 1,080 of these lines (though some displays —
many plasma TVs, for example — have a nonstandard number of lines,
like 768).
When you look at specs for a particular display, you might see resolution
discussed in two related but different ways:
• Display resolution: Also called a display’s native resolution, this is
simply the number of pixels or lines of resolution that the display
has on its screen. Most new TVs (with the exception of traditional
CRT “tube” TVs, discussed in Chapter 13) have a fixed display 
resolution — meaning that they are physically built with a certain
number of pixels and anything they display on the screen will 
consist of that number of pixels, regardless of the resolution of 
the video signal going into the display. Display resolution is what 
it says it is — the measure of your display’s resolution.
• Input resolutions: Different video sources (like analog TV, DVDs,
and high-definition TV [HDTV] signals) have their own resolution.
For example, HDTV signals have 720 or 1,080 lines of resolution,
while analog TV signals have 480 lines. A display’s input resolu-
tions are simply the resolutions of the video signals that the TV
can accept and display. As an example, a specific high-definition
display may have a display resolution of 720 lines but be able to
accept inputs of 480, 720, and 1,080 lines of resolution — but will
display the 1,080 signal at the lower 720 resolution. We talk more
about display and input resolutions in Chapters 13 and 14.
 Fields and frames: This is a holdover from the film world, where each
individual picture on a reel of film is called a frame (and 24 of them flash
by the projector bulb each second). When TV was first developed, the
technology of the day wouldn’t allow full frames to be displayed at the
rate at which TV signals worked, so each frame was divided into two
fields, each of which contained half the scan lines we discuss in the 
preceding bullet (all the odd lines in one field, and all the evens in the
other). Traditional TV systems display 60 fields every second — 30
frames per second — but the newest systems, discussed in the next
bullet, can be capable of up to 60 frames per second.
 Scanning method: Up until very recently, just about all video systems
(all the common ones, at least) used something called interlaced scanning,
which we actually describe in the preceding bullet. In an interlaced
system, half the lines are drawn on the screen in one cycle of the video
system, and in the next cycle, the other half are drawn (not the top and
the bottom, but weaving — or interlacing — every other line). Because
this happens really fast (each set of lines is drawn 30 times per second),
your eye can’t really tell that things are being drawn this way — unless

you stop to think about the flickering you see and the way some vertical
and diagonal lines on your TV screen appear jagged. Progressive scan
systems (see Figure 4-1) draw all the lines (a whole frame) at the same
time and can help reduce these characteristics. The effect is a picture
that is more like film, which is what we’re shooting for in a home theater.
Odd lines (short in this illustration)
are Field 1, Even lines are Field 2.
Combined, they produce an interlaced
Frame. In progressive scan, all lines are
drawn simultaneously
Note: lines continue all the way across
the screen, truncated for illustrative
purposes

Chapter 4: Getting the Big (Video) Picture
Making film into video
As if resolution and scan methods were not
complex enough, you may run into something
called 3:2 pulldown removal or correction, or
simply 3:2 pulldown. This is a process that deals
with the fact that an extra field (screen) image
appears when the 24-frames-per-second films
are transferred to 30 frames per second for 
TV (or 60 fields). See, when you take 24 frames
and make them fill a 60-field space, your system
copies each field two or three times, in alter-
nating sequence, to fill the 60 fields required. This
creates motion artifacts that appear like jerky
movements on the screen when you look closely.
What 3:2 pulldown does is remove that extra
third field, so the original balance between
frames is restored. You want a progressive-
scan DVD player with great 3:2 pulldown
removal. You can tell how good it is by looking
at sharp lines on the screen, such as telephone
wires or porch railings. Many high-definition
TVs have their own 3:2 pulldown systems built
in as well, in case your DVD player can’t do this
for you.

Switching from Analog to Digital
Television is undergoing some radical changes — and we’re not talking about
programming. Like most other devices before it, the television is beginning to
make the leap from the analog to the digital world. Unlike many of those
devices, however, TV has been making the leap in a series of agonizingly slow
steps. In this section, we discuss how this transition might affect your choices
in the video world. We talk also about the various kinds of TVs you can buy.
The conversion from analog to digital and old-style TV to next-generation TV
comes into play in many places:
 The encoding of the programming signal itself — whether it goes onto a
DVD or over a cable to get to your home theater
 The transmission (or production) path that the signal takes in getting to
your house
 The receiver — internal or external — that receives and decodes the
signal for display
In the progression of standards and technical development, change is taking
place along all three of these paths.
Understanding the old standard: 
The analog signal
The majority of television signals coming into homes are still analog. Analog
TV signals reach homes through over-the-air broadcast TV, by traditional
cable TV systems, and by satellite.
In North America, an analog system known as NTSC (National Television
Standards Committee) has been in place for decades. (The standard is over 60
years old, having been first developed in the 1940s!) In fact, it hasn’t been
changed or updated since the advent of color television in the 1960s. Although
this system is capable of producing a surprisingly good picture under ideal
circumstances, its analog nature makes it susceptible to various kinds of 
interference and signal degradation. Consequently, the picture can be down-
right awful by the time it actually gets to your television, which is why the TV
world is slowly turning digital.
Analog television displays a maximum of 480 scan lines (525 total, but you
can’t see them all because some are used for things such as closed captioning),
displays 30 frames (60 fields) per second, and is an interlaced system. See
“Learning to Talk Videoese,” earlier in this chapter, for explanations of these
specs.
50
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

Just as the NTSC standard is common in North America (and Japan), a couple
of other standards — known as PAL and SECAM — are common in other
parts of the world. Unless you have a special TV designed for the purpose,
you can’t tune into PAL broadcasts with an NTSC TV or NTSC with a PAL TV.
This is one reason why you can’t buy videotapes in many parts of the world
and use them in the United States.
Anticipating the rise of digital TV
The move from analog to digital is well afoot. Millions of homes have some form
of digital TV, but the conversion from analog to digital is still an evolving process.
The key concept behind any kind of digital TV is that the audio and video pro-
gramming is converted from an analog signal into a series of digital bits (a whole
lot of ones and zeros). The primary technology behind any kind of digital TV (at
least in the United States and Canada — other countries have their own variant
of digital TV) is something called MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group).
Several video and audio compression and digitization standards are based on
MPEG. Most are named by adding a number to the end of MPEG. The MPEG-2
standard is by far the most common in the video world, with MPEG-4 coming
on strong. (Another, older, standard, MPEG-1 is also supported by DVDs and
is used for the VideoCD, which is more common outside of the U.S.)
The digital television (cable or satellite) signal and DVDs that most people
receive today use MPEG-2 as their encoding to digitally transport or store
standard, analog NTSC signals. This is an important fact to repeat: Typically,
when you use a digital TV system (such as a DSS satellite system) or a 
prerecorded digital source (such as a DVD), you get an analog signal that has
been transmitted or stored digitally. The signal itself — the program that goes
into your TV — is still analog. Digital over digital is our nirvana and is here
now, but only for some programming, as we discuss shortly.
As you might have suspected, high-definition TV — which is becoming much
more widely available, but which still makes up only a small fraction of the
total TV landscape — is digital all the way.
Even though the video signal coming out of a DVD player is NTSC (an interlaced
format, as we mentioned above), some DVD players can convert this into a
progressive-scan version of NTSC, which you can use if you have a progressive-
scan TV.
When this digitized signal gets to your house (over a digital cable system, a
DBS satellite system, or on a DVD), a set-top box, satellite receiver, or DVD
player converts the signal back to analog NTSC TV, which your TV under-
stands and can display. This digital transmission signal coming into your
house usually looks and sounds better than an analog one because the digital
transmission path is cleaner and isn’t susceptible to the interference that
51
Chapter 4: Getting the Big (Video) Picture

usually messes up analog signals. The same is true of DVD versus analog
sources, such as laser discs and VCR tapes. Digital is always better.
You can get better-quality analog content on DVD, and higher-quality DVDs are
available. For instance, you might run across Superbit DVD, which is a Sony
system for superencoding (using more digital bits and bytes to store) DVD
content. Superbit DVD follows the existing DVD format, so you don’t need a
special player to play a Superbit DVD. These discs simply use storage space
that’s normally taken up by fancy on-screen menus and extra features (such as
movie trailers and outtakes) to store more encoding (about double the bits)
for the movie signal itself. The result is a much more stunning picture.
Better DVDs — ones that can display a full high-definition picture (with a
much greater resolution than NTSC) — are on their way soon. By the time you
read this, the first Blu-ray and HD-DVD discs and players will be on the market,
providing the first disc-based true high-definition sources for your home the-
ater. We talk about these new disc formats in Chapter 6.
The real takeaway we want you to understand here is that many things that are
called “digital” — like most (but not all) digital cable, digital satellite TV services,
and “regular” DVDs (that is, DVDs that aren’t using the new Blu-ray or HD-DVD
formats) — provide you with a nice digital picture that is not high-definition TV.
These digital video signals are (usually) just the same resolution as the older
analog TV signal — they’re simply stored and/or transmitted by digital systems.
There’s nothing wrong with these digital systems (they’re great, in fact!), but we
mention this because we have run into many people who think that digital cable
or digital satellite or DVD is the same thing as HDTV, and that’s just not true.
Looking toward the next generation 
of digital TV
Most of today’s digital television isn’t all it can be. Several years ago, the FCC (the
Federal Communications Commission, the controlling regulatory authority for
broadcasters, cable companies, and telephone companies in the United States)
brought together a big bunch of television industry folks. After a long, painful,
and contentious process, the group came up with a new generation of digital TV.
This new system goes by the catchy name ATSC (Advanced Television Standards
Committee) and follows a bunch of new, higher-definition television standards.
Introducing ATSC
Specifically, ATSC uses digital-video signals (not analog ones) that are trans-
mitted using digital technologies and are played on TVs set up to display
these digital signals. Even the connection to the TV itself is digital. “It’s digital
all the way, baby,” as sportscaster Dick Vitale would say. (Did we mention
we’re Duke Blue Devils fans, too? Nothing better than watching Duke basket-
ball in high definition on the big screen!)
52
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

Many people call ATSC digital TV or DTV. We do, too, sometimes, but we’re
going to stick with the name ATSC in this discussion to help keep the difference
between ATSC and other digital television services (like digital cable or digital
satellite TV) distinct. Aren’t we user-friendly?
Even though ATSC is all digital, all the time, TVs that are designed for ATSC
can also connect to good old analog NTSC systems. And some of the stuff
coming in over an ATSC system is NTSC. For example, most commercials will
probably continue to be taped using NTSC systems for quite some time, and
the vast majority of reruns will be NTSC as well (although these NTSC signals
will be carried digitally over the ATSC system).
ATSC television standards are different from the digital cable or satellite TV
we discuss in the preceding section. To view them in all their glory (and we’ve
seen enough of high-definition television to tell you that it is indeed glorious),
you need to buy the newer, fancier, better, more expensive TV — an HDTV.
Exploring HDTV
When we talk about new ATSC-capable televisions, we’re talking a whole new
ballgame (or at least a whole new way to watch a ballgame). It takes only a glance
to see the striking difference between older NTSC displays and the new ATSC ones.
ATSC signals can be divided into different groups, depending on the signal’s
resolution and the scanning method (which we discuss in the beginning of this
chapter). They are further divided into
 SDTV (standard-definition television): These signals are about the same
or a little bit better than NTSC.
Note: A related category here is EDTV, or enhanced-definition television,
which is essentially a widescreen version of NTSC.
 HDTV (high-definition television): HDTV has truly spectacular — dare
we say filmlike? — picture quality.
Within the ATSC standard are 18 SDTV, EDTV, and HDTV variations, but you’re
most likely to see just six, as shown in Table 4-1.

You sharp readers will probably note that we threw an extra format in here that’s
not currently available in any digital TV broadcast (or cable system or satellite
system) but which may become available some day in the future. That’s the final
one — 1080p — which has become something of a holy grail amongst TV manu-
facturers even though there are no 1080p signals available to display on such a
set. 1080p is simply a progressive-scan variant of 1080i. The forthcoming Blu-ray
and HD-DVD disc formats may support it, and certain video games on the new
Microsoft Xbox 360 and forthcoming Sony PlayStation 3 may support it as well,
but there are no, we repeat, no TV signals today or in the near future that will be
1080p. We mention it for completeness’s sake and because you’ll hear it all the
time when you go shopping. We’ll get into 1080p in more detail in the chapters
in which we talk about TVs and displays (Chapters 13 and 14, to be precise).
Theoretically, a progressive-scan system has a better picture than an interlaced
one, but in our minds, resolution is more important (not everyone agrees).
We’d rather have 1080i than 720p if given the choice. But we’d take either
kind of HDTV over anything else. It’s just awesome to see HDTV in action.
To take advantage of all the benefits of digital TV, you need to have a high-
definition-capable television and some sort of TV tuner that can decode the
ATSC signal. That tuner can be inside the display (just as most TVs have analog
NTSC tuners), it can be in a separate tuner component, or it can even come
inside a satellite TV receiver or cable set-top box.
Traditional televisions don’t have the internal circuitry to decode digital TV
signals, and they generally don’t have screens that can display high-definition
ATSC pictures in all their glory. (And HDTV is the big deal in this story — we
focus our discussion on HDTV rather than SDTV.)
Traditional TVs aren’t even the “right” shape. The aspect ratio (the ratio of
screen width to height) of HDTV signals is wider than that of NTSC signals.
NTSC is 4:3; HDTV is 16:9. Figure 4-2 shows the difference in aspect ratios.
The HDTV screen has an aspect ratio like the elongated screens in movie 
theaters. (You may have already been exposed to this aspect ratio because
many movie DVDs today allow for this sort of viewing as an option. See the
sidebar, “Wide, wider, widest: Aspect ratios,” later in this chapter.)
54
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 

A lot of people see 4:3 and 16:9, do the math quickly in their heads, and think
they are the same thing. It’s confusing because 4 and 3 are the square roots of
16 and 9. The actual math used to determine the ratio of screen width to screen
height is 16 divided by 9 (which rounds out to 1.78) and 4 divided by 3 (which is
1.33). So for a given display height, a 16:9 screen is about 34 percent wider than
a 4:3 screen.
HDTV-capable TV sets, which became available at the end of 1998, are more
expensive than traditional sets. However, prices have come down signifi-
cantly. Just three or four years ago, HDTVs often cost more than $6,000, but
now you can get one for $1,000 or less. In fact, you can buy a small (27-inch
or less) “tube” HDTV for under $500.

Chapter 4: Getting the Big (Video) Picture
Wide, wider, widest: Aspect ratios
Aspect ratios are one of the more confusing
parts of video, although they used to be simple.
That’s because television and movie content
was all about the same size, 4:3 (also known as
1.33:1, meaning that the picture is 1.33 times as
long as it is high). The Academy (as in, “I’d like
to thank the Academy”) Standard before 1952
was 1.37:1, so there was virtually no problem
showing movies on TV.
However, as TV began to cut into Hollywood’s take
at the theater, the quest was on to differentiate
theater offerings in ways that could not be seen
on TV. Thus, innovations such as widescreen film,
Technicolor, and even 3-D were born.
Widescreen film was one of the innovations that
survived and has since dominated the cinema.
Today, you tend to find films in one of two
widescreen aspect ratios:
 Academy Standard (or “Flat”), which has an
aspect ratio of 1.85:1.
 Anamorphic Scope (or “Scope”), which has
an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Scope is also called
Panavision or CinemaScope.
HDTV is specified at a 16:9, or 1.78:1, aspect ratio.
If your television isn’t widescreen and you want
to watch a widescreen film, you have a problem.
And the industry powers that be have come up
with two solutions (other than “go out and buy a
widescreen display”).
The most common approach in the past has been
what’s called Pan and Scan. For each frame of a
(continued)

56
Part I: Welcome to the World of Home Theater 
film, a decision is made as to what constitutes the
action area. That part of the film frame is retained,
and the rest is lost. What’s left is usually a fraction
of the main frame, sometimes as little as 65 
percent of it, and this can often leave out the best
parts of a picture. Imagine some of the scenes
from Gunfight at OK Corral with the two 
gunslingers at each end of the picture. One of the
gunfighters would have to go off the screen in
Pan and Scan.
The second (and growing more popular)
approach is to display the original full image on
the TV set without filling the whole screen. When
watching content formatted for a widescreen TV
(1.85:1, 2.35:1, and so on), you see black bars at
the top and bottom of the image. This technique
is known as letterboxing (after the effect of
seeing an image through an open mail slot in a
door). Conversely, when watching content for-
matted for TV (4:3) on a widescreen TV, you see
black bars on the left and right of the images.
This is known as windowboxing.
An obvious problem with viewing widescreen
images on a normal 4:3 TV is that the image does
not use all 480 scanning lines of the screen. Some
of those 480 lines get used just to draw black bars
instead of drawing video you actually watch.
(Some 4:3 TVs use a technique called anamorphic
squeeze to eliminate this issue.) This yields lower
resolution, something that anamorphic formats
attempt to resolve. Also known as 16:9 Enhanced,
Widescreen Enhanced, or Enhanced for 16:9
Televisions, anamorphic presentation squeezes
the image horizontally until the full 4:3 frame is
filled. If you look at an anamorphic picture on a 4:3
screen, the picture appears somewhat distorted
because everything is compressed, but the full 480
lines of content are retained. Luckily, when you tell
your DVD player you have a 4:3 screen, it puts the
anamorphic image back into a letterbox. When
played through a 16:9 player, the original width is
presented, while maintaining the full 480 vertical
lines of resolution.
Most DVDs have both a Pan and Scan and a
widescreen format (either letterboxed or anamor-
phic) on a DVD. Because including both versions
creates an added expense to the studios, some
DVDs ship with just one format onboard, and
some titles actually have different formats on dif-
ferent discs. Be sure to check before you buy a
disc if this is important to you.
As an interesting note, there are a few examples
(Pixar’s Finding Nemo being the most famous)
where movie producers have specially modified
their content to have different widescreen and
4:3 versions — so the folks with 4:3 displays
aren’t robbed of part of the image while still filling
their screens.
(continued)
We talk a lot more about HDTVs in Chapters 13 and 14.
After the switch to digital TV is complete, you don’t have to pitch your
old TVs. Special, separate digital TV tuners (much like set-top boxes used
for older TVs on cable networks) enable you to watch DTV programming
on older TVs. Of course, the picture quality and resolution won’t be as
high as it would be with a new digital set, and you might not have a
widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio, but you’ll see (at today’s resolutions and
quality) the programming coming in over tomorrow’s digital networks.

Source Devices

In this part . . .
P
art II builds on the basics with more detailed cover-
age of all the things that you might want to drive
your home theater — the source devices that feed audio
and video into your system.
We start at the, er, source of 21st-century entertainment —
audio sources. These range from the venerable AM/FM
tuners up to the fanciest MP3 players. After that, it’s on 
to the video realm, where we talk about things like DVDs,
VCRs, and PVRs (personal video recorders) — and even
how you can bore your neighbors with home movies on
your home theater. Yawn!
Then we discuss sources from outside your home — cable,
broadcast TV, satellite, and even new services that offer
you video on demand and other network-based content.
Then comes the really fun stuff — the gaming systems.
Whether your heart is in Xbox, Nintendo, or Sony, you’ll
want to know how to set these up — even if you don’t
have kids. (Since Pat’s little Annabel is just two years old,
he had to use this book as the main argument to his wife
for buying a new Xbox 360.)
PCs are on tap next, and we help you understand how to
really take advantage of all the audio and video sources
that the Internet has to offer and how to get them into
your home theater system. We help you understand how
to download movies (legally) off the Internet to watch
whenever you want to and how to record those episodes
of The Sopranos that you keep missing.
We close this part with the really cool component in your
home theater — content accessed over the Internet.
Whether it’s watching Google videos or TV shows you
downloaded — either via iTunes or with the help of some

A
home theater is about more than just movies and TV. Most people
spend as much money on the audio side of their home theaters as they
do on their video equipment.
In this chapter, we discuss the components you might add to a home theater
system for listening to prerecorded music and audio broadcasts (what we
used to call radio back in the old days — but it’s more than just AM/FM now).
Checking Out Your CD Player Options
Since the CD format debuted in the 1980s, tens of billions of CDs have been
pressed. So it goes without saying that you need a CD player in your home
theater, right? Well, actually, that was a trick question.
Although you definitely want your home theater to have a device that can
play CDs, you may not need (or want) a traditional CD player in your system.
Your DVD player, which we think you absolutely must have in your home the-
ater, can do double duty as your system’s CD player. You can also play CDs
on the game consoles we talk about in Chapter 9, or you can use a home 
theater–ready PC, which we discuss in Chapter 8.

Despite this, you might want a standalone CD player (instead of using
another device to play your CDs) for the following reasons:
 You are shooting for the highest-quality CD reproduction: If you’re a
real audiophile, you might want to spend a considerable chunk of cash
on a fancy, no-holds-barred, top-of-the-line CD player that can eke that
last little bit of musical fidelity out of a disc. If so, check out companies
like Arcam, Naim, and Rega, which make fancy and expensive ($1,000
and up) CD players.
 You want special CD features: Some people buy jukebox CD players that
can hold hundreds of CDs (so they never need to load a new disc after
the hours-long initial setup). Others want a CD player that can also burn
(create) CDs. Keep in mind that these features are percolating over into
the DVD world as well, but for now, the CD versions of these devices are
much cheaper.
 You are creating a multizone system: In a multizone system (which we
discuss in Chapter 10), you can listen to different source components in
different rooms. For example, you can watch a movie on the DVD player
in the home theater while the kids listen to a CD in the kitchen. You can’t
do that if the DVD player is your only CD player.
These three reasons are all perfectly valid — for some people. Don’t let them
scare you into buying a CD player. Today’s DVD players do a great job of play-
ing back CDs, so skipping over the standalone CD player is a good way to
save a few bucks.
Choosing a CD Player
So you know you want a standalone CD player, but which one? If you already
have a CD player, go ahead and use it. The following list highlights some
things you might want to look for if you choose to buy a CD player (or aren’t
sure about the one you have):
 Digital outputs: You can often get better sound out of a CD player if you
connect it to your receiver via a digital connection instead of an analog
one. On the back of most CD players, you can find one (or both) of two
kinds of digital outputs — optical and coaxial — which are equal in qual-
ity. (We discuss these in Chapter 16.) The key thing to consider, how-
ever, is finding out what kind of inputs you have on your receiver and
buying your CD player accordingly.
 The ability to play CD-Rs, CD-RWs, WMAs, and MP3s: If you’re into
burning your own CDs or like to listen to others’ homemade CDs, make
60
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

sure the player you buy has these buzzwords on the box. Otherwise,
you won’t be able to listen to those homemade discs.
 Multidisc capability: If you like to load up the CD player with a bunch of
CDs, consider a CD changer, which usually holds five to ten discs, or a
CD jukebox that can hold hundreds.
 Remote control: Many manufacturers have special connectors that can
go between their components (like a CD player and a receiver) to facili-
tate controlling everything from a single remote control. For example,
with Sony’s S-Link, a Sony receiver and remote can control a whole
bunch of different Sony devices. As you shop for a CD player, keep your
receiver in mind, but if you’re set on, say, a Sony CD player and a
Pioneer receiver, don’t let the remote options hold you back. It’s very
easy to get a universal remote control that can operate gear from differ-
ent vendors.
In addition, always look for some basic quality measures when you’re choos-
ing gear. For example, does the CD tray open and close smoothly? Can you
read the display from across the room? Before you buy, always try to test
drive gear in the showroom or your home (if you’re shopping at the high end).
The New Kids on the Block — 
SACD and DVD-A
The CD is overwhelmingly the most common source of prerecorded music in
a disc format, but around the turn of the millennium, two new formats hit the
streets — SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) and the DVD-Audio disc.
Both formats are designed to sound better than a CD while maintaining that
familiar, 12cm (quick — grab that metric converter) disc format. Although
you may remember the marketing tag line, “Perfect sound, forever,” from
when CDs debuted, SACD and DVD-A have managed to improve upon the now
old-fashioned CD:
 Sampling: SACD uses very small sample sizes but records them 64 times
more often than regular CDs. The DVD-Audio system uses a lower sam-
pling rate (still two or more times faster than CD), but a much larger
sample (20 bits or more, compared with 16 for CDs). Either way, you get
higher audio frequencies with less noise and thus greater dynamic range
(the difference between the quietest and loudest musical passages on
the disc).
61
Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music

 Multichannel format: Because the discs can hold more data than the
older CD format, record companies can release DVD-Audio and SACD
discs in both traditional 2-channel (stereo) and home-theater-friendly
5.1-channel formats (with five channels of surround sound and a sub-
woofer channel). Some folks don’t particularly like the surround sound
for music; they say it makes sense only for movies, where things are
happening all around you. But lots of others, us included, like surround
sound for at least some of the music we listen to.
Some of the early SACD players didn’t support the multichannel format,
though all the current models we know of do. Also, not all SACD or DVD-
Audio discs are recorded in surround sound format.
Both the SACD and the DVD-A have been tested by the experts, measured by
the measurers, and reviewed by the reviewers, and the consensus is that both
sound better than CD. How much better is a matter of great debate, but in a
high-quality system, with a good recording, you’ll probably be happy to have
one of these systems. Before you buy, though, keep three things in mind:
 You can’t find much material in either of these formats . . . yet. Chances
are, you can’t buy all your favorites on these formats. A lot of classic
recordings have been reissued in one or the other format, but the
number is still small compared to all of the music out there.
 Not all players can play both formats. Unless you are committed to
only one or the other format (SACD or DVD-A), make sure you choose a
“universal” player that can play CD, DVD, SACD, and DVD-A. Pay atten-
tion because some manufacturers (notably Sony, who was the primary
technical supporter of SACD) don’t make many (or even any) universal
players.
Most SACD players and DVD-Audio players do play regular CDs and regu-
lar DVDs, which is nice. Look for ones that can play MP3s, CD-Rs, and
CD-RWs, as well, so that you can play homemade CDs, too.
 Because of copy-protection concerns, you might not be able to connect
your DVD-Audio or SACD player to your receiver digitally. This means
that all that high-resolution audio must travel to your receiver in the
analog domain, making the audio more susceptible to picking up noises
or generally degrading during its trip to your ears. To make matters
worse, multichannel systems require six of these analog cables. Ugh.
Luckily, as we write, a few manufacturers have begun to come out with
matched A/V receivers and DVD-Audio players that let you use a single
digital connector (usually a FireWire cable — see Chapter 16) to connect
these devices — but only if you buy both from that manufacturer.
62
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Many home theater receivers have only a single set of multichannel audio
inputs. So if you use them to connect an SACD/DVD-A player, they won’t be
available for other multichannel audio inputs (like an external surround
sound decoder or a DVD player with a built-in surround sound decoder).
Keep that in mind as you’re shopping around.
Neither SACD nor DVD-Audio have really taken off in the marketplace. Both
formats sound great, but many folks have begun to move toward on-line
music (like Apple’s iTunes Music Store) and computer-based audio and away
from these higher–quality, disc-based, audio formats. We think that you can’t
go wrong with a nice universal disc player that handles both formats, but
unless you’re really an audiophile and have (or plan to buy) a bunch of discs
in these formats, you really don’t have to spend too much time worrying
about SACD or DVD-Audio. The bottom line: Get a universal player if the DVD
player you’re shopping for includes this functionality, but don’t go out of
your way for one of these formats unless you’re really sure you’re going to be
using it.
Many SACD discs, like ABKO Records’s newly remastered editions of the clas-
sic 1960s Rolling Stones CDs, are dual layer. This means that there is a layer
of CD data and a layer of SACD data on the same disc, so you can play the
same disc in your car and in your home theater SACD player. You can’t do
that with a DVD-Audio disc today — at least not until someone comes up 
with dual-layer DVD-A discs. There are, however, discs known as DualDiscs
(www.dualdisc.com) that include a CD on one side and a DVD on the other.
Note that this isn’t DVD-Audio, but rather a regular DVD, which can include
video and even a surround sound mix of the record, but which isn’t in the
higher resolution DVD-Audio format.
Moving Computer Audio 
into Your Home Theater
The really big trend in audio these days (for the past several years, in fact) is
computer-based audio files. At the simplest level, these files are just like any
other file on your computer, except that they contain digitally encoded music
files that you can play back on your computer, on a portable device, or in
your home theater.
MP3 is the most common format for digitally storing music and other audio
files on a computer or computer-like device, but it’s not the only format out
there. A few others, such as Microsoft’s Windows Media (WMA) and Advanced
63
Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music

Audio Codec (or AAC, used by Apple’s iTunes Music Store), are also incredibly
common — and are the formats most often used for music purchased on the
Internet.
We use the term MP3 to refer to on-line music here, because it’s still the most
common music format, but on-line music files may be encoded using other
file formats (as we discuss throughout the chapter).
MP3-mania has exploded worldwide over the past couple of years, initially
because on-line services such as Napster (now dead as a file-sharing program
but reborn as an on-line music store — www.napster.com) and KaZaa
(www.kazaa.com) have enabled people to share and download songs con-
verted from CDs to the MP3 format. MP3 has retained its popularity because
its small file size has made it a very attractive system for carrying music
around on computer-like portable audio players, such as our (and every-
body’s!) current favorite, Apple’s iPod (www.apple.com/ipod), or Creative
Lab’s ZENMICRO (www.creative.com).
Lots of people are moving their MP3 files beyond the PC and the portable
player these days and are beginning to find ways to incorporate MP3 music
into the home theater. This makes a lot of sense to us — why not listen to all
your MP3s on the highest-quality audio system in the house?
Learning about digital audio file types
As we mention in the previous section, MP3 is not the only game in town
when it comes to digital audio file formats — other formats, like AAC and
WMA, are becoming increasingly popular due to their use in on-line music
stores.
There are two main categories of these audio formats (often called codecs —
from their function, which is to compress and decompress music into digital
files). The first category includes lossless codecs. This means that all of the
musical information that forms the basis of the audio file is preserved when
the file is compressed and stored on the computer. Lossless codecs provide
the highest audio fidelity, but the files they create are relatively large, which
means that you can fit fewer songs on a computer hard drive or music server.
Lossy codecs, on the other hand, discard some part of the musical informa-
tion in order to make the files smaller — for faster downloads on the Internet
or to cram more music on a given size of computer storage device. These
lossy codecs use sophisticated models of the human ear (and how it hears
sounds) to throw away bits of musical information that are less important
when you are listening to the music. You probably won’t notice the difference
64
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

when listening casually, but many people (especially folks with good hear-
ing!) can hear a difference when a lossy and lossless version of the same
music are played back over a high-quality home theater audio system.
The most common lossless codecs you’ll run across are as follows:
 Windows Media Lossless: Part of Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 and
10, this codec is built into the Windows Media Player software and is sup-
ported by some of the media adapter systems we discuss in Chapter 10.
 Apple Lossless: Included with iTunes software, Apple’s Lossless Encoder
is Apple’s competitor to Windows Media Lossless.
 Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC): Free Lossless Audio Codec is, as its
name implies, a lossless codec that is free. It’s part of an open source ini-
tiative, and you can find out more at http://flac.sourceforge.net.
A few of the audio players we discuss in Chapter 10 are beginning to sup-
port the FLAC codec, including the Sonos Digital Music System and the
Slim Devices Squeezebox.
Among the most popular lossy codecs are the following:
 MP3: MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) 1 Audio Layer 3 is the full
name of the most common digital music format. MP3 audio files are the
ones commonly traded (usually illegally) on the Net, and they are the
most common digital music codec used on PCs and digital music sys-
tems in a wireless network.
A limited number of systems and software applications also support the
more advanced mp3PRO codec, which adds a technology called SBR (or
Spectral Band Replication) to improve the sound quality over standard
MP3-encoded music files.
 WMA: Windows Media Audio is the standard audio format used by the
Windows Media Player and compatible hardware. A lossless version of
WMA (discussed earlier) does exist, but most WMA files use a lossy
compression system.
 AAC: Advanced Audio Codec is the format used by Apple Computer’s
popular iTunes Music Store and is the default codec used for music
encoded using the iTunes application. Like WMA, AAC files are lossy
(though within Apple’s iTunes system there is a lossless codec as well,
called Apple Lossless).
 Ogg Vorbis: Another free codec is Ogg Vorbis (www.vorbis.com). Ogg
Vorbis is designed to be free from the licensing fees that software and
hardware companies must pay for other codecs like MP3, while provid-
ing improved sound quality compared to other lossy codecs.
65
Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music

Your choice of codec will depend upon a couple of things:
 Where you get your music from. If you buy digital music at an on-line
music store, you’re stuck with the codec that they use. Most stores use
WMA or AAC and not MP3 because these formats allow the record com-
panies to stick DRM (digital rights management) software into the music
files, which keeps buyers from sharing this music on the Internet. If you
create your own music from CDs at home, your choice will be influenced
by the software you use.
 The devices you use to play your music in your home theater. As we
discuss in Chapter 10, there are a large number of devices (usually called
media players or adapters) that you can use to get music from a computer
into your home theater. Most of these devices support only a limited
number of codecs, so you have to match the codec you use to create and
store digital music with those supported by your media player.
 Personal preference also comes into play. Many folks simply find that
they prefer a lossless codec or that they prefer a codec like AAC (which is
“newer” and takes advantage of advances in codec technology) to one like
MP3. We recommend that, after you’ve figured out the first two criteria,
you “try out” a few different codecs and see if you can tell a difference.
We talk in great detail about the sources for digital music and also about the
devices that you can use to integrate this music into your home theater in
Chapter 10. The Media Center PCs we discuss in Chapter 8 are also a great
way to get digital audio into your home theater.
Getting your hands on MP3s
We bet you’ve heard a lot about MP3 music, but where do all these MP3s
come from, anyway? Is there an MP3 fairy out there who magically dumps
them on the hard drives of good girls and boys?
Well, in fact, there used to be something pretty similar. Napster (which is now
gone, due to legal actions) and other file-sharing services allowed people to
put their music collections on-line and share them with the world. Of course,
record companies weren’t all that supportive of this grassroots music revolu-
tion, so most of these services got sued out of existence soon after starting.
Today, you can get your own MP3 files (and notice we call them files, because
they’re just that — computer data files on a hard drive) in two legal ways:
 Rip your own: You can convert your CDs to MP3s on your computer (this
process is called ripping). To do this, you need a PC with a CD or DVD
drive (which we bet you already have) and an MP3 program. Our favorite
programs are MUSICMATCH Jukebox for Windows (www.musicmatch.
com) and iTunes for the Mac and Windows (www.apple.com/itunes).
66
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 Download legally: These days, it’s really easy to find legal places to
download the most popular music on MP3 (or in AAC or WMA formats).
Some of our favorite on-line music stores include Apple’s iTunes Music
Store (available within Apple’s iTunes software or at www.apple.com/
itunes/) and Rhapsody (www.rhapsody.com). We talk about a bunch
of these stores in Chapter 10.
Old-School Jams — Turntables
For most of the world, the LP has unfortunately gone the way of the dodo.
But although LPs are far from the public eye, they’ve never really gone away.
Many artists still release LP versions of their new records, and a handful of
small manufacturers (and a few big ones) continue to crank out turntables.
In fact, the turntable has become hip again in some circles. And many audio-
philes have long felt that LPs (at least when played on super-high-quality
turntables) sound better than CDs.
Buying a turntable isn’t as simple as buying a CD, DVD-A, or SACD player. 
It’s a much more subjective process. In the digital world, it’s easy to keep a
checklist of features in mind, such as digital output or MP3 CD support. But
when you start shopping for turntables, you’re really getting into a whole dif-
ferent world. There’s some really esoteric stuff out there, such as vacuum
hold-down systems (which suck the record flat on the platter to alleviate
warps), and there are what we call “religious wars” between proponents of
different turntable design philosophies. Having said that, here are a few
things to consider when buying a turntable:
 Belt drive or direct drive: The platter (the thing that the record sits and
spins around on) can be spun in two ways. There are pros and cons for
each.
• Belt drive: In this setup, the motor is separated from the platter
and spindle and turned by a rubber belt that runs around the out-
side of the platter. A belt drive tends to isolate the rest of the
turntable from any vibrations coming from the motor (vibrations
that the stylus or needle could pick up and transmit to the receiver
and to your ears). On the downside, a belt drive tends to be less
accurate than a direct drive in its playback speed, which can lead
to changes in the pitch of your music.
• Direct drive: An electric motor is directly attached to the spindle
(the small cylinder that the platter rests upon). Direct drive turnta-
bles tend to be a bit more constant in their speed, so the turntable
is more likely to turn 331⁄3 times per minute without any speed vari-
ations (such variations tend to make your music sound warbly).
67
Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music

Some folks, however, feel that direct drive turntables are more sus-
ceptible to vibrations (both external, like footsteps, and internal,
like the vibrations of the motor itself).
 Suspended or unsuspended: Vibrations are a big deal with a turntable
because the stylus dragging through the grooves of the LP can pick up
extraneous vibrations (like those caused by your feet walking across the
floor) and transmit them along with your music. Some turntables have
elaborate suspension systems designed to isolate the platter (and there-
fore the record) from these vibrations, whereas others rely on the user
to isolate the entire turntable (by placing the whole thing on a very
sturdy rack, for example).
 Automatic, semiautomatic, or manual: An automatic turntable lets you
put a record on the platter, push a button, and listen. The turntable itself
moves the tone arm over the record, drops it down before the first song,
and then lifts it up and returns it to the resting position when the side of
the record is done. High-end audiophiles hate these because they —
well, we don’t know why they hate them so much, though we guess they
just love to drop that needle down. Manual turntables require you to
manually move the tone arm over the record and then lower it onto and
off the record. Semiautomatics do half your work for you — you lower
the stylus onto the record, but when the record side is finished playing,
the turntable lifts the tone arm and stylus up off the record automati-
cally so you don’t have to hear that repeating fpppt fpppt fpppt sound as
the stylus does an endless loop at the end of the record.
In our opinion, good turntables can have any of the attributes we just 
mentioned. We’ve heard good automatic turntables and good manuals, good
belt drives and good direct drives, and so on. If you’re buying a turntable,
think about what your needs are. Do you have a lot of records that you’re
going to play all the time? If so, invest $500 to $1,000 dollars in a nice
turntable from a company such as Rega (www.rega.co.uk) or Pro-Ject
(www.project-audio.com). Have just a couple of old favorites you can’t
get on CD? Check out some of the $150 to $200 models from Sony or Denon.
Want to be a DJ (and do some scratching like the late, great Jam Master Jay)?
Check out Panasonic’s Technics brand of DJ turntables.
Whatever you do, don’t leave a turntable out of the equation if you have a
few boxes of records in the closet.
Because LPs are much less popular than they used to be, many new A/V
receivers don’t have the proper inputs to connect a turntable. So before you
plunk down some cash on a new turntable, check to see whether your receiver
even has a turntable connection (usually labeled “phono”). If it doesn’t, you
can use an external phono preamp, which connects between the turntable and
the receiver. You simply plug the cables from the turntable into the phono
68
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

preamp and then use a standard audio cable to connect the preamp to any
open audio inputs on the receiver (most people use the ones labeled “aux”).
Recoton (www.recoton.com) makes an inexpensive phono preamp for about
$50, but you can buy more expensive (and better) preamps from some of 
the turntable manufacturers that we mention in this section. You can also 
build your own phono preamp from kits available on-line at places like www.
bottlehead.com.
69
Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music
Catching up with cassettes
If you need a cassette deck because you have
a ton of tapes filling shoeboxes in your closet,
or because you want to make tapes for playing
back in the car or in a portable headset, here
are a few things you should look for:
 Single or dual well: If you think you might
end up dubbing (or making copies of) a lot
of cassettes, you need a dual-well tape
deck that has this capability. If you plan to
record only the radio or your own CDs, you
can save money by getting yourself a
single-well deck.
 Noise reduction: Before Dolby Labs
became famous for its surround sound
standards (like Dolby Digital), millions of
audiophiles knew the company for its
Cassette Noise Reduction standards. These
standards (which go by the names Dolby B,
C, and S) are electronic processes
designed to increase the sound quality of
cassettes by decreasing noise (like tape
hiss — the sound you can hear when quiet
passages are playing). The general rule for
these systems is that the higher the name
of the system, alphabetically, the better (so
S is best, then C, then B). The key thing to
keep in mind is that you must have the same
system that you record the tape with on the
tape deck you use for playback. If you
record with Dolby C, you need to play your
tape on a Dolby C deck. Dolby S is a slight
exception to this rule; tapes recorded with
this system can be played back on Dolby B
decks with at least some of the benefits of S
intact.
 Number of heads: Most tape decks have
two heads (the heads are the electromag-
netic devices that read and write audio sig-
nals onto the tape itself). The two-head
design uses the same head for both playing
back recorded music and for recording
music on the tape (the other head is used
for erasing the tape when you are record-
ing). Fancier tape decks have a three-head
design, which has separate playback and
record heads. Because each head is used
for only one function, each head can be
designed for optimal functionality for its
purpose.
 Number of motors: A tape is moved over the
heads by means of a pair of spindles (which
fit in the little wheels on the cassette) 
and — more importantly — by a pair of
devices called a capstan and pinch roller.
The capstan and pinch roller are the essen-
tial devices that keep the tape moving over
the heads at the correct speed, without any
speed fluctuations. Inexpensive tape decks
use a single electric motor and a belt (like a
radiator fan belt in a car) for this function,
while higher-quality decks have a motor for
each of the spindles and a third for the 
capstan/pinch roller combo.

Tuning In to Radio
Sometimes, you just can’t be bothered to put in a CD or SACD or cue up an
MP3 (not to mention pull out, clean off, and play a record). You know that
couch potato lethargy we’re talking about? If you’re a music lover (and we
bet you are), then nothing allows you to enjoy music with absolutely no
involvement like turning on your favorite radio station and vegging out.
Local radio
In the home theater you don’t usually have to think about much when it comes
to radio. Unless you’re buying separate components, you have a radio tuner
built in to your A/V receiver.
If you do buy separate components instead of an A/V receiver (sneak over to
Chapter 10 if you don’t know what we’re talking about), you probably will
have to buy a radio tuner and plug it into your system as an audio source
device, just as you plug a CD or DVD-Audio player into your system. AM/FM
radio tuners usually range in price from about $150 to $500 (though, like any
A/V component, you can buy high-end versions that cost ten times the aver-
age). Things to look for include the following:
 AM and FM sensitivity: Measured in the oh-so-familiar decibel femtowatt
(dBf), this is a measurement of how well the tuner can pick up signals.
The lower this number (it’s usually in the range of 9 to 11 dBf), the better.
 Adjustable selectivity: Some tuners come with a switch on the front (or
on the remote control) that lets you choose between wide and narrow
selectivity. The wide mode gives you better reception and sound quality
on powerful stations, whereas the narrow mode can tune in weak signals
from distant stations while avoiding interference from stations on adja-
cent frequencies.
 Antenna diversity: Not a necessity, but some fancier tuners have two
antenna inputs that you can manually or automatically have the tuner
choose between when you’re trying to pull in a radio station.
If you’re lucky enough to live in an area with some good radio stations, you
might want to invest in a high-quality tuner near the top of your price range.
Satellite radio
If you’re like us, you live where there isn’t a whole lot of programming you
really want to listen to. In that case, you might check out satellite radio,
which offers a huge number of stations (each of the two satellite radio
70
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

providers offer over 100 channels) beamed to your house or car from a hand-
ful of geostationary satellites hovering above the equator. We find that there’s
just a ton more diversity and just plain interesting stuff coming across these
space-based airwaves than we find on our local radio today. Satellite radio
services from XM Radio and Sirius require you to — gasp — pay for your
radio (both start at $12.95 a month).
If you want to get into satellite radio, you need to first check out the Web
sites of the two providers, www.xmradio.com and www.sirius.com, to see
which one has programming that you prefer. Then, you need to get your
hands on a satellite radio tuner (you can find a bunch of different models
listed on each company’s Web page). The majority of these satellite tuners
are designed for in-car use (because people tend to listen to the radio most
often while they’re driving), but you can find radios suitable for in-home (and
home theater!) use from both providers.
If you want to put satellite radio into your home theater, you have a few
choices:
 You can get a dockable tuner. You can put these tuners in your car and,
when you get home, pull them out and plug them into your A/V receiver
via a simple docking station that provides power, an antenna connec-
tion, and the proper connectors to hook into your receiver. This is usu-
ally the cheapest and most convenient approach if you’re going to be in
the car a lot but still want satellite radio in the house.
 You can buy a dedicated in-home satellite tuner that looks like any other
piece of A/V gear and sits on your equipment rack along with your
receiver and DVD player. These models (like Polk Audio’s XRt12
Reference Tuner — $299.99 list price, www.polkaudio.com) have
bigger displays and higher-quality internal components for the best
sound quality, but they aren’t portable like dockable radios.
 You can buy an A/V receiver with a built-in satellite receiver. A growing
number of A/V receivers (see Chapter 11 for the lowdown on these
devices) have a built-in satellite receiver. Just add an antenna kit and a
subscription and you’re off to the races (or listening to Howard Stern if it’s
a Sirius radio!). A good example here is Denon’s AVR-4306 (www.denon.
com, $1,999.99), which includes a built-in XM radio receiver as well as dis-
crete iPod and USB player inputs.
If you’re using a dedicated indoor satellite tuner (or one inside your receiver)
and you also want to listen to satellite radio in your car, you’ll end up needing
more than one subscription. Each individual tuner requires its own subscrip-
tion. Luckily, the second subscription can be part of a package deal and will
run you $6.99 per additional radio on either service.
These satellites are down by the equator, so no matter where you live in the
United States, you need to be able to put the antenna in a south-facing window
to pick up a good signal in your home.

Chapter 5: Treating Your Ears to Music

Internet radio
If you set up a home theater PC in your A/V system, you can get lots of great
radio programming from Internet radio broadcasts. Using an MP3 player, such
as MUSICMATCH Jukebox or iTunes, or a streaming media player, such as
Windows Media Player or Real Player (www.real.com), you can tune in to lit-
erally thousands of radio stations from around the world. With a broadband
DSL or cable modem Internet connection, the quality is pretty decent, too.
So if you’re like Pat, and you find that San Diego is just out of range of the
great PBS station in Santa Monica (www.kcrw.org), you can just tune in on
the Net. Pretty cool, and it doesn’t cost you an extra penny. This is also a
great way to get the radio broadcasts of your favorite college sports teams.
Neither of us ever misses a Duke basketball game, even if we’re on the road,
because we can tune in on our laptops. Go Blue Devils!
In Chapter 10, we tell you about media players and adapters that can support
Internet radio. You can also use a Media Center PC, as described in Chapter 8.

Feeding Video into Your Theater
In This Chapter
 Digitizing your video experience with DVD
 Being old school with VCRs
 Personalizing your TV with a PVR
 Incorporating video extras into your home theater
I
f you’re like us, watching movies is the main reason you decided to get a
home theater in the first place. High-quality music reproduction and high-
impact video gaming are just (awesome) side benefits. You can get movies
(and TV shows and other video content) into your home theater system in
many ways — such as plugging into a cable or satellite TV system or even
hooking up an antenna for broadcast TV. (We talk about all of these TV sys-
tems in Chapter 7.) For most folks, however, watching a movie means watch-
ing a prerecorded movie (typically a movie on DVD that you’ve bought or
rented from the local video store — or on-line through a service like Netflix).
In this chapter, we talk about the key sources of prerecorded video in your
home theater. We spend most of our time discussing the source that’s most
important to us and most likely to you as well — the digital video disc, better
known as the DVD. (They’re also sometimes called Digital Versatile Discs
because they don’t just carry video.) We also introduce you to the two new
(and competing) systems for delivering high-definition TV on DVD-like optical
discs. Get ready for VHS versus Betamax, round two — with high definition as
a reward this time! We also talk about the VCR, the personal video recorder
(or PVR), and some other nonbroadcast sources of video.
DVD Rules the Roost
The DVD is a high-quality centerpiece to a home theater. Keep in mind the
cardinal rule of any A/V system: Garbage in equals garbage out. The corollary
of this states that no matter how good your video display and audio system

are, if you put a junky, low-fidelity signal into them, you’re going to see and
hear junky, low-fidelity home theater. That’s why DVD is so important — it’s 
a cheap, easy-to-use, high-quality system for movies and movie soundtracks.
And the better your display (like an HDTV), the more you’ll appreciate a high-
quality signal being fed to your display.
In this section, we spend a little time talking about the DVDs themselves and
what they can do. Chances are good that you are already familiar with the DVD
(after all, DVD has been one of the most — if not the most — rapidly adopted
new technologies of all time). But DVD is a moving target — manufacturers of
DVD players have continually improved their gear and added new features that
both improve picture quality and make your DVD viewing more convenient. So
read on and be prepared to discover something new!
Getting to know DVDs
The DVD is a 12cm optical disc (by the way, optical means that the data on
the disc is read by a laser). From a distance, a DVD looks just like a CD. The
big difference between the DVD and the CD is the format that each uses for
burning those little digital pits into the disc (pits that turn into digital 1s and
0s when the laser reads them). Because the DVD uses a more complex for-
matting scheme, it has the capacity to store a lot more data than a CD. A DVD
can hold a minimum of 4.7GB of data (dual layer DVDs, discussed later, can
hold more), whereas a CD’s limit is about 700MB (so a DVD can hold more
than six times as much data).
A DVD’s extra capacity is crucial to home theater because it lets the DVD
store about two hours of high-quality digital video and digital audio signals
using Dolby Digital or DTS (see Chapter 3 if you don’t know what these are)
and an analog two-channel stereo signal as well. A CD, well, it can’t hold more
than a few dozen minutes of this kind of home theater data.
You’ll also hear, as you begin getting deeper into the home theater world,
about dual layer and double-sided DVDs. These discs (which work just fine in
any DVD player) hold even more data for long movies and cool extras, such as
deleted scenes or director commentary. The additional space is made possi-
ble by putting the extra data on either — no surprise here — a different layer
of the DVD or on the other side (so you just have to flip the disc, like an LP).
Like a CD, the DVD stores its information in a digital format (you probably
guessed that from the name) and, for video, uses the MPEG format that we
discuss in Chapter 4. The DVD can also hold the audio soundtracks that cor-
respond to this video in a variety of Dolby and DTS formats, as well as cool
extra features, such as additional foreign language soundtracks, subtitles,
74
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

scene indexes (which let you skip to different scenes in a movie, just like you
can skip to different songs on a CD), and more.
The DVD can also do something that most other home theater source devices
(we talk about a few others later in this chapter) can’t do. It can display true
widescreen video.
Not all DVDs (the discs themselves, not the DVD player) give you a true
widescreen anamorphic picture. Many DVDs have been formatted in the stan-
dard 4:3 aspect ratio instead. If you want widescreen, you need to pick DVDs
with labels that say “anamorphic,” “widescreen,” “16:9,” or something similar.
Many movie companies put both versions on a single disc (using the dual-
layer technology we just mentioned) or release both widescreen and Pan and
Scan (frames cropped to fit a traditional television screen) DVD versions of
an individual movie. See Chapter 4 for all the details about widescreen view-
ing — including a handy explanation of the term “anamorphic.”
Choosing a DVD player
Well, we’ve talked a lot about why we think DVD players are so important in a
home theater. Now comes the fun part — picking one out. There’s some really
good news here, especially if your budget is like ours (and most people’s),
which is to say, limited.
DVD technology has advanced incredibly in the few years that DVD players
have been on the market, and the price drops have been stupendous. For
example, Pat’s not-quite-2-year-old somehow laid an impressive beating on
his old DVD player. No worries though! He was able to buy a sweet new
upconverting (we’ll explain this in a moment) HDMI-equipped player for about
half of what he had paid for the previous DVD player. (So thanks, Annabel, for
letting Daddy get a new DVD player!) Bottom line is this: If you’re still sitting
on the DVD fence, get off it!
Like every single piece of A/V gear we discuss in this book, you can spend a
fortune on a DVD player if you want to. And you may want to if you’re build-
ing a really fancy, no-holds-barred, high-end home theater. Although you can
get a great picture from that $59 model, if you have a high-end video projec-
tor and a top-of-the-line surround sound audio system, you might want to buy
a fancier model. Such a system yearns for higher-quality electronic compo-
nents and more powerful chips to convert the digital data on the DVD into
video and sound. Just to give you an idea of the range of prices, as we write,
the current prices of a single company (Denon) range from $150 to $3,500.
75
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

So what should you look for in a DVD player? We think the following items are
the key things to put on your mental checklist as you start shopping:
 Connections on the back: We talk in detail about the “hierarchy of con-
nections” in Chapter 16. For video, the best connection for DVD players is
the component video connection, and just about all (but the very cheap-
est) DVD players have these (as do almost all displays these days — and
all HDTV-capable TVs will). If you have a TV that can accept these con-
nections, make sure you get a DVD player that can also use them. On the
audio side of things, you’ll find two kinds of digital connectors (for Dolby
Digital and DTS digital surround sound) — the coaxial and optical (or
Toslink) connections. The key thing here is to make sure that the connec-
tors on your DVD player match up with those on your A/V receiver.
Some of the newest DVD players have moved on to digital video outputs.
If your display supports an HDMI or DVI connection, consider a DVD
player that has one of these outputs.
 Single or multidisc capability: DVD players come in single-disc and mul-
tidisc models. For just watching movies, a single-disc player is fine, but if
you plan to use your DVD player as your only CD player, you might want
to pay a bit more for a multidisc player that lets you provide hours of
background music during, for example, a party.
 Progressive or interlaced: Progressive scan is becoming a really big
deal because the video industry is gradually moving from interlaced
video toward a progressive video future. We discuss progressive and
interlaced scans in more detail in Chapter 4, so we don’t bother you with
that here. Bottom line: If you have an HDTV or other progressive-scan
monitor, you want a DVD player that offers progressive-scan capabilities.
Although most progressive-scan TVs have a built-in deinterlacer for
playing interlaced material (DVDs are still interlaced), the deinterlacers
in many progressive-scan DVD players are better. Even if you don’t have
a progressive-scan display but might someday, consider a progressive-
scan DVD player as well, especially considering that prices on these
DVD players have dropped so much that they’re hardly more expensive
than a regular DVD player — in fact, all but the cheapest DVD players
these days have progressive-scan functionality.
 Upconversion: The “latest and greatest” feature found in many new DVD
players is the ability to upconvert a DVD to a higher resolution for play-
back on your HDTV display. An upconverting DVD player has an internal
scaler (see Chapter 13 for more on this device’s functionality) that allows
it to take the 480i resolution stored on DVDs and convert it to 480p (pro-
gressive scan) or (more significantly) to a 720p or 1080i signal. Essentially,
an upconverting DVD player gives you a simulated high-definition version
of the video on your DVD. Just as important, an upconverting DVD player
uses the HDMI or DVI outputs we discuss previously to send this picture
76
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

to your HDTV display — so you get all of the benefits of a digital connec-
tion and a picture that’s designed for a high-definition display.
 Support for other formats: Many DVD players now support on-line
video file formats like DivX or xvid. This can come in handy if you are
downloading HDTV video clips from the Internet using these formats —
you can burn DVDs on your computer and play them back on your DVD
player.
 Adjustability: To get the best out of a home theater, you need to do
more than just plug everything in properly. You also need to spend some
time tweaking the audio and video settings to get the best picture in
your room. Most of these adjustments are done on the TV or projector
itself, not on the DVD player. But some DVD players allow you to adjust
things such as brightness (or black level) in the DVD player.
 Surround sound decoder: If you are starting your home theater from
scratch, we recommend that you buy a home theater receiver (or sepa-
rate components decoder) that is capable of decoding (at a minimum)
Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital surround sound signals. If, however,
you are adding a DVD player into an existing home theater with an older
receiver that doesn’t support digital surround sound, you can buy a DVD
player with a built-in surround sound decoder. The downside of this is
that you need to use six analog audio cables to connect the DVD player
to your receiver, instead of a single digital interconnect. Some of the
older receivers were marketed as “Digital ready” with six preamp jacks
on the back for just this purpose; if your receiver doesn’t have a built-in
Dolby Digital decoder and it doesn’t have these six inputs (or its own
Dolby Digital decoder), you can’t play back digital 5.1-channel surround
sound with it!
 Audio disc support: All DVD players can play back store-bought, prere-
corded CDs. Not all, however, can play back homemade CD-R or CD-RW
discs, nor can many DVD players play back CDs containing MP3 music
files. If these features are important to you (and you don’t have a CD
player that can handle this for you), make sure your DVD player can
handle all these formats before you buy.
 Recording capability: Just as the CD has moved from a factory-produced,
read-only CD to a “make your own” medium (such as CD-Rs and CD-RWs),
so has DVD recording started to become a truly consumer-friendly tech-
nology. We discuss the pitfalls of DVD recording (and there are pitfalls,
due to some incompatible industry standards) in the sidebar, “Recording
your own DVDs,” later in this chapter.
 Remote control: Most people have too many remote controls when they
get into home theater. To avoid remote overload, look at how other sys-
tems in your home theater can control your DVD player. For example,
many A/V equipment vendors have special “system link” cables that let
77
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

the receiver control the DVD player and other components. The down-
side of such systems is that you must buy all your equipment from the
same vendor to take advantage of them. The alternative (which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 15) is to use a universal remote control to control every-
thing. If you’re going down this route, ask your dealer if there are any
special codes or other things you need to consider before buying a spe-
cific DVD player.
 DVD extras: Many DVDs include extra features that you’d never get on a
VHS tape, laserdisc, or other (older) video source. For example, some
DVDs have alternate camera angles — so you can click a button on the
remote control and see the film from a different character’s perspective.
Most DVD players support this feature, but not all do. You can also find
DVD players that have special features, such as a digital zoom that lets
you enlarge part of the picture on your screen, or a frame-by-frame fast
forward, so that you can watch that starship explode in excruciating
detail. You can even buy DVD players that can display standard PC or
Mac JPEG picture files from Kodak’s PictureCDs or from your own home-
made CD-R.
 All-in-one functionality: The DVD players with built-in surround sound
decoding are a first step in this direction, but if space is limited in your
home theater, you may want to take the full leap — DVD players and A/V
receivers all-in-one slim chassis. Lots of these models are part of lower-
priced “home theater in a box” systems, but you can also find very high
quality (and expensive) all-in-ones. For example, the Scottish high-end
A/V manufacturer Linn (www.linn.co.uk) has a very cool all-in-one
system called the Classik Movie System.
If you’re buying an inexpensive DVD player, it’s probably okay to choose one
based on features and reviews (we list a bunch of places to find these reviews
in Chapter 23). But if you plan to spend $400 or more on a DVD player and are
lucky enough to have a good home theater shop or dealer nearby, take the
time to get a good audition of the DVD player. Do this in the showrooms of
the dealer, at a minimum, and at home with a demo model, if possible. You’re
the one who’s going to be watching movies on this machine, so make sure
your eyes like what they see.
Playing DVDs on an HDTV
Many folks hear “widescreen” and “digital” and think “HDTV.” Well, DVD is
not HDTV. DVD is digital. It provides a great picture, but it isn’t a true high-
definition video source. Although DVD looks better than ever before when
you play it back on an HDTV (using a progressive-scan DVD player we men-
tion earlier in this chapter), DVD doesn’t give you the same quality of picture
that a full-on HDTV signal (coming in over a broadcast TV signal or from your
cable or satellite provider) can give.
78
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Why don’t traditional DVDs “do” HDTV? Well, for one reason, HDTV wasn’t
fully finalized and on the market when the DVD was developed, so DVD was
designed to work with the TVs of the time (which are still the majority of TVs
today). More importantly, HDTV requires a ton (literally, we measured) of dig-
ital data. Using the traditional NTSC signal, you can fit a two-hour movie com-
fortably onto a DVD, but you wouldn’t be able to fit more than a fraction of
that movie onto a DVD if it was encoded as an HDTV signal.
Upconverting DVD players give you something approaching HDTV, but the
video being fed from these players into your display is not true HDTV. To get
true HDTV, manufacturers have to go beyond the traditional DVD — and the
next section spells out two paths the DVD industry is taking.
79
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
What’s the region thing all about?
Region codes, which you may see in catalogs
or on DVDs themselves, enable movie studios to
control who can watch DVDs (the studios are
like that about a lot of things). The codes are
both embedded in the DVD itself and also coded
into the circuitry of the DVD player primarily so
that movie studios can release movies and
DVDs at different times in different places. So a
movie may be released theatrically in the United
States first, and then, several months later, it is
released theatrically in Europe and also
released on DVD in North America. The region
code prevents North American retailers from
selling the DVD to European customers while
the movie is still in theaters there.
If you dig around on the Internet, you can find
region-free programs for the PC or modified,
universal, region-free DVD players. We’re gen-
erally supportive of this concept (especially
when we find that some foreign movie we really
want on DVD isn’t available in our North
American region code), but we’re going to leave
you to your own devices when it comes to
region-free players. The movie studios are
really down on this concept, and often aggres-
sively pursue legal actions (including jail time)
against people who try to crack the region
codes. In fact, we’re not going to say any more
on the subject — jailhouse uniforms don’t really
fit either of our senses of fashion and style.
By the way, here are the regions:
 Region 1: North America
 Region 2: Western Europe, Middle East,
Japan, and South Africa
 Region 3: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
and Southeast Asia
 Region 4: Australia, New Zealand, and Latin
America
 Region 5: Eastern Europe, Africa, and India
 Region 6: China
 Region 7: Reserved (For the moon maybe?
We’re not too sure.)
 Region 8: Special international venues
(such as cruise ships and airplanes)

Putting the HD in DVD
What’s really exciting in the DVD world is the development of a couple of new
DVD formats that will allow true high-definition programming to be available on
optical discs. A number of companies have banded together into two groups
with competing standards for these next-generation, high-def disc formats:
 Blu-ray: Led by Sony, the Blu-ray camp has developed a high-definition-
capable disc format that is also being supported by Apple, Dell, HP,
Panasonic, Pioneer, Thompson, Philips — and a whole bunch of other
companies. The really big deal for Blu-ray is that Sony is making it the
disc format for their forthcoming PlayStation 3 gaming console — so the
format will end up in a lot of homes quickly.
 HD-DVD: The competing format championed by Toshiba, HD-DVD also
has an illustrious list of companies behind it, including Microsoft, HP,
Intel, NEC, and others.
Yep, it looks like we’re heading into another format war, in which two compet-
ing groups of companies agree to disagree and push two different standards
onto the market. This happened a few years ago with high-resolution audio
discs (read about SACD and DVD-Audio in Chapter 5), and the results weren’t
pretty for anyone. With the audio discs, basically no one bought either format
in significant numbers, though both are still plugging along. This isn’t the first
format war to hit the home theater industry either — if you recall the early
days of VCRs, Sony and Matsushita duked it out over the Betamax and VHS
formats.
Sometimes, one format wins out over another (for example, VHS over
Betamax); other times, neither one becomes a clear winner. In the case of
high-def DVDs, it’s still way too early to tell because the first DVD players 
that can handle either of these disc formats are not yet on the market in the
United States.
So we can’t predict which format will win the hearts and minds of consumers
at this point. An interesting thing to watch will be the actions of the movie
studios who actually create and sell the discs themselves. Right now, most
studios have chosen one or the other format — pretty much splitting down
the middle, with a slight advantage to Blu-ray. (Sony owns a few motion pic-
ture studios itself, which helps here.)
We expect that if one or the other format really becomes dominant, all of the
studios will eventually begin to sell movies in that format, no matter which
camp they are in today. Heck, Sony sold a lot of movies in the VHS format,
even though Betamax was its baby!
80
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Betting on Blu-ray
The Blu-ray disc, as we mention above, was developed by Sony and is sup-
ported by a bunch of companies (including all of Sony’s motion picture 
studios).
Blu-ray will be a very capable disc format — by which we mean that there
will be lots of storage space on a Blu-ray disc. Storage space is the key for
high-definition disc formats simply because HDTV takes up as much as nine
or ten times the storage space (for any given length of video) than does a
standard-definition DVD-quality video. So you really need to be able to cram 
a lot of bits on the disc to make high definition work.
The good news here is that Blu-ray can hold a lot of bits and bytes — up to
50GB of data (more than five or six times what a standard DVD can hold).
That 50GB capacity is for a dual-layer disc; a single-layer disc can hold 25GB
of data — enough space for at least two hours of high-definition program-
ming. Blu-ray discs can hold even more data if the disc is encoded using a
more efficient codec (like MPEG 4 instead of MPEG 2), which means you can
potentially fit four hours of high def on a single-layer disc.
Blu-ray discs will support all of the same audio formats that a regular DVD
supports but will also include the latest and greatest from Dolby — Dolby
Digital Plus and Dolby TrueHD. (See Chapter 5 for more on these formats.)
Because no A/V receivers include decoders for these new formats today, the
first Blu-ray disc players will have a built-in surround sound decoder and will
connect via analog cables for Dolby Digital Plus or TrueHD. You can use a
standard digital audio cable, however, for Dolby Digital or DTS.
The Blu-ray disc has two big advantages in the coming market battle with HD-
DVD. First, it has more storage space (which can be a huge deal with HDTV).
Second, it’s going to be sitting in millions of living rooms inside all of the
PlayStation 3 game consoles that Sony expects to sell starting in mid- to 
late-2006.
Blu-ray gets its name from the color of the laser that reads the discs inside a
Blu-ray player. Instead of the traditional red laser used by CDs and “regular”
DVDs, Blu-ray uses a blue laser. (We bet you knew what we were going to say
there, huh?) The blue laser has a smaller wavelength and is more suited to
reading the physically smaller spots on the disc itself. This ability to focus in
on smaller spots allows the disc to have more spots — and more spots means
more data.
81
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

Heading toward high def with HD-DVD
Toshiba’s competing format, HD-DVD (high-definition DVD) is in many ways
similar to Blu-ray. Like Blu-ray, HD-DVD supports high-definition video. And
like Blu-ray, it uses a blue laser to focus in on smaller spots on the DVD itself.
The big difference is that HD-DVD is more similar to a traditional DVD in the
way that the disc itself is constructed and in the way that a movie (or other
data) is stored on the disc. This similarity is a double-edged sword — it
makes HD-DVD discs less expensive to manufacture, but at the same time it
limits the absolute storage space on a single disc. HD-DVD discs can hold
about 15GB of data on a single-layer disc and 30GB on a dual-layer disc. So
you get about 40 percent less video on a disc with HD-DVD than you’d get
with Blue-ray.
As we write, HD-DVD players will be the first on the market in the United
States, with Toshiba launching two models in the spring of 2006, starting at
about $500. Interestingly, there might be an HD-DVD game console angle simi-
lar to the Blu-ray PlayStation 3, as Microsoft has announced that it will pro-
vide an external HD-DVD drive for the new Xbox 360.
When you look at the relatively smaller capacity of HD-DVDs, you might think
that Blu-ray is a slam dunk, simply due to its apparent technical superiority.
Well that may or may not end up being the case, for two reasons. First,
because HD-DVD discs are quite similar to regular DVDs, they can actually be
produced on the same manufacturing lines without too much retooling. This is
a big deal, especially when you stop and think about how many DVD produc-
tion lines there are in the world, pumping out hundreds of millions of DVDs
every year. Blu-ray will require a much more expensive factory upgrade —
something that may slow the availability of Blu-ray discs.
Second, HD-DVD will hit the market first. The Toshiba players will be on the
market well ahead of the first mainstream Blu-ray players. (In Japan, you can
already buy a Blu-ray player, but it costs in the multiples of thousands of dol-
lars and isn’t widely available.) This “first to market” advantage may give HD-
DVD the momentum it needs to succeed.
Figuring out where to go from here
As we mention in the beginning of this section, it’s just too soon to tell with
Blu-ray and HD-DVD. Both formats produce amazing pictures (we’ve seen
both and were blown away by both!). Both have an array of blue-chip compa-
nies behind them. (Sorry, we couldn’t avoid the pun.) It could go either way,
both ways, or neither way. We just can’t tell.
82
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

We are pretty sure, however, that at least one of these formats will be very suc-
cessful. As many as 10 percent of all homes in the United States have HDTVs
these days, and there is essentially no prerecorded high-definition material to
play on these expensive TVs. People are anxiously awaiting a solution.
The safest bet for someone building a home theater might be to wait for a 
universal disc player that can handle both formats. None are yet formally
announced, but several manufacturers have hinted both in private and in
public that they will build such a device. We can’t wait!
VCRs Ain’t (Quite) Dead Yet
We spend a lot of time talking about DVD players because we love them so
much. But we realize that some movies just aren’t available on DVD yet (or
ever, in some cases). And you probably want to record TV shows that you
won’t be home for or watch home movies you’ve recorded with your cam-
corder. Or you’ve got a zillion VHS tapes that you’re stuck with in a DVD age,
like Danny. These are all areas in which a videocassette recorder (or VCR)
comes in super handy.
You can buy three kinds of VCRs today:
 VHS VCRs: These are your standard, garden-variety VCRs that have been
around for 40 years or so. They use VHS videocassettes and record a low-
resolution TV signal (only about 240 lines of resolution). Most of these
VHS VCRs are cheap (less than $100), and most include stereo audio
capabilities (if so, they’re labeled HiFi) and analog Dolby surround sound
capabilities.
 S-VHS VCRs: The S-VHS (or Super VHS) VCR uses a special S-VHS tape to
provide a higher-quality, higher-resolution (400 lines, instead of 240) pic-
ture. Regular VHS tapes work on these decks, but S-VHS videocassettes
don’t work on most regular VHS decks. (If you plan on trading tapes with
someone or using a regular VHS VCR you have elsewhere, keep that in
mind.) S-VHS VCRs start off at around $90.
 D-VHS VCRs: The latest and greatest in the VCR world, these are high-
definition VCRs. D-VHS VCRs can play and record standard VHS and 
S-VHS videotapes. More importantly, D-VHS VCRs can also record all the
HDTV formats (discussed in Chapter 5). You can get a limited number of
movies on prerecorded D-VHS videocassettes, but it’s a small number
compared to what you can get on DVD. You can buy a D-VHS VCR for
about $500 — if you can find one.

Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

The D-VHS system has been out for over five years now and has essen-
tially been a major flop on the market. These recorders actually work
pretty well, with great picture quality, but folks have gotten used to the
wonders of DVDs, with their almost instant access to any spot on the
disc, their durability, and just the plain fact that you never need to
rewind a tape (nothing worse than forgetting to rewind!). And PVRs (per-
sonal video recorders, discussed in the next section) have pretty much
completely taken over the TV show “time shifting” role in most homes.
So while a few manufacturers still make D-VHS recorders, they’re all but
gone from the market. We suspect that Blu-ray and/or HD-DVD will
finally kill them off for good. We can’t really recommend that you buy a
D-VHS deck, but we won’t try to stop you if you do — just be aware that
there’s probably not a lot of future in these devices.
When buying a VCR of any kind, look for the following things:
 HiFi capability: All the D-VHS and S-VHS VCRs have this, and most regu-
lar VHS decks have this feature as well. If you buy a model without it,
you won’t even get stereo sound — just crummy mono (one-channel)
sound.
 VCR Plus+: This system enables the average human being to record a
certain show at a certain time more easily. With this system, you simply
punch in a special code that is listed in your paper’s TV listings (or in TV
Guide) next to the show you want to record. More-advanced versions of
VCR Plus+ (called Silver and Gold) allow you to localize your VCR Plus+
settings for your area.
 All-in-one units: Some VCRs are incorporated into a single chassis with
a DVD player or with a MiniDV or other camcorder tape player. These
all-in-one units take up less room on your equipment rack, if space is a
concern. And the VCR/camcorder tape combo units make it easy to
make VCR copies of your home movies.
Even if your VCR is in the same chassis as a DVD player, you can’t make
tapes of your favorite DVD movies. A copy protection system called
Macrovision keeps you from doing this, and it’s built into all DVD play-
ers, all VCRs, and most commercial DVD discs. Even if you want to copy
your favorite movie from DVD to VHS to play back on a VCR in your
vacation home or somewhere else, you’re just plain out of luck.
We’re not all that enthusiastic about the VCR these days (although we think
the D-VHS would be pretty cool if many people weren’t restricted from using
it for its intended purpose — recording HDTV shows for later playback). Even
big movie rental places like Blockbuster are phasing out VHS tapes in favor of
DVDs. But we do think it’s worthwhile to have an inexpensive VCR in your
home theater, just to have the capability of playing older movies that you
can’t find on DVD. We recommend you get an inexpensive S-VHS model —
and don’t spend too much money on it.

PVRs Rock!
One reason we’re not all that interested in VCRs these days is because we’ve
found the PVR, or personal video recorder, which offers a much better way to
tape our favorite shows. PVRs are basically purpose-built computers that
record video onto a standard computer hard drive. Think of it as a computer-
based VCR. There are no tapes to wear out, break, or jam — just a fast, reli-
able computer hard drive.
Actually, the metaphor of a PVR being like a computer-based VCR really sells
the PVR short. Using a PVR is soooo much better than using a VCR that it’s
actually hard to begin to describe the benefits of the PVR. Don’t just take our
word for it, look at these things you can do with a PVR (and not with a VCR!):
 You can play back one recorded show while simultaneously recording
another.
 You can pause live TV (if you’re recording it on your PVR).
 You can skip the commercials with the click of a button if you are record-
ing the show and start watching a couple minutes past the start time.
(Broadcasters hate this feature and are suing some PVR vendors.)
 You can let the PVR automatically record your favorite show every time
it’s on. (All PVRs connect to a program service, usually via a telephone
line, that has a complete program guide for weeks at a time, customized
for your area.)
 You can use the program service to help you find shows.
 You can connect some PVRs to a computer network (some models even
have built-in wireless network connections) and the Internet so you can
share recordings with your friends or send copies of shows you’ve
recorded to your PVR at your vacation home (if you have one).
Traditionally, PVRs are sold as standalone boxes — generally the size and
shape of a cable set-top box, a DVD player, or any other A/V component.
These units start off at as little as $50 for a unit that has enough hard drive
space to record 40 hours of programming, and they go up in price for larger-
capacity units. You also need to pay a monthly fee (around $10 per month,
though you can pay $250 for a lifetime subscription) to get the necessary pro-
gramming guide service. The major manufacturer of standalone PVRs is TiVo
(www.tivo.com). We talk about some of the neat features of TiVo’s most
recent PVRs (like the cool TiVo ToGo feature) in Chapter 10.
None of TiVo’s PVRs can record or play back HDTV content. In our opinion,
this is a major, major shortcoming. For standard definition, TiVo’s PVRs are
great devices, with the best software for controlling the recording and play-
back processes, but we really recommend them only for home theaters that
don’t have HDTV and that aren’t using a set-top box for satellite or cable TV
reception.
85
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

Beyond TiVo, the real action in the PVR world these days comes in the form
of PVRs that are integrated into other devices. The most common place you’ll
see this is within a cable or satellite set-top box (and for those of you who
can get TV services from the phone company, in their set-top boxes as well).
Integrating the PVR into the set-top box has a couple of huge advantages:
 It makes setup and operation easier: With the PVR hardware and soft-
ware as part of the set-top box itself, you have nothing to hook up and
nothing to configure; it’s just there. That’s huge, considering that getting
a standalone PVR configured to control your set-top box or satellite
receiver is a major pain in the rear end.
 The whole experience is more integrated: As we discuss in Chapter 7,
most TV providers include on-screen programming guides, video on
demand, and more. PVR becomes just another one of these functions
and is tightly integrated into the experience — so setting up a recording
is typically the work of one or two button pushes while you’re looking at
your on-screen guide.
 They can support HDTV: This is the biggest deal for us. Both satellite
and cable providers are offering HDTV PVRs that can record and play
back high-definition TV broadcasts, to which we can only say thank you!
 They can support two-tuner operation: Standalone PVRs can typically
record only one show at a time, so you can watch a show while record-
ing it, or watch a recording while recording another show, but that’s it.
Most cable or satellite PVRs are two-tuner models that allow you to view
and/or record two shows at a time. This gives you the ability to watch
one show while recording a different show or even record two shows at
a time while watching a recording of a third show. You’d have to be a real
TV junkie to miss anything with this capability.
 They might not cost anything up-front: While standalone PVRs require
cash out of your pocket to buy the unit, most cable and many satellite
PVRs don’t cost you anything up-front. You simply pay a monthly ser-
vice fee (which you also would pay for standalone PVRs), and you don’t
need to buy any equipment.
As we write, the cable and satellite PVRs have the upper hand in terms of
functionality and practicality. But TiVo isn’t standing still, and the TiVo folks
may surprise us all with some must-have functionality when they release
their third generation of PVRs sometime in 2006. All we know for sure is that
we gotta have our PVRs (no matter who makes them). It’s simply a must for
our home theaters, and if you ever use a PVR, we are sure it will become a
must for yours, too.
You can also use a PC as a PVR. We talk about this more in Chapter 8.

Homegrown Video Programming
You don’t have to limit your home theater viewing to prerecorded DVDs and
television broadcasts. You can also incorporate video from your own sources.
Many folks like to make their own video programming — home movies and the
like. We think that these videos deserve a proper playback system — and we
think that the home theater is the right place. Another source of video in the
home that a lot of people don’t think of when designing their home theater is
in-house closed circuit or surveillance video.
87
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater
Recording your own DVDs
PVR hard drives, no matter how big, eventually
run out of space, and home movies take up a lot
of digital space, too. Eventually, you have to
store your video somewhere — both to archive
it so that you can use the hard drive or cam-
corder tape for new stuff, and also so that you
can share your content with others. The best
way to do this, in our minds, is by making your
own DVDs.
Just as you can create your own CDs by using
a CD burner (or recorder), you can now easily
make your own DVDs by using a DVD recorder.
There are two ways you can do this:
 Buy a DVD recorder: This is an A/V compo-
nent, like a DVD player that has a built-in
mechanism for recording DVDs as well.
 Use a PC with a built-in DVD recorder:
Apple, Sony, and a few other PC vendors
sell computers with built-in DVD recorders.
You can also buy an internal or external
(connected with a USB or FireWire cable)
DVD burner for your existing PC.
In either case, you have a somewhat difficult
decision to make because the makers of DVD
recorders have decided that cooperating (for
the sake of the consumer) is simply not some-
thing they have in them. So there are three
completely incompatible systems out there for
DVD recording: DVD-R/RW, DVD-RAM, and
DVD+R/RW. Ugh — acronym soup. Although it’s
really ugly and very confusing to the consumer
(look at the plus and minus signs closely), here’s
a little help.
DVD-R/RW systems are generally con-
sidered the most compatible with existing DVD
players — so you have the best shot at having
your homemade DVDs play back on your mom’s
or friend’s or whomever’s DVD player (though
even with this standard, it only works on about
90 percent of DVD players). DVD-RAM is the
least compatible; you basically need another
DVD-RAM recorder or player to play back these
discs. DVD+R/RW is close to DVD-R/RW, only
slightly less compatible.
If you’re making DVDs only for yourself, these
distinctions might not be too important. You can
play back your DVDs on the machine that made
them no matter what. If you have sharing in
mind, then we suggest the DVD-R/RW or
DVD+R/RW recorders.

Camcorders
Although the topic of camcorders is beyond the scope of this book, we do
want to put in a few words about fitting a camcorder into your home theater.
(See Digital Video For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Martin Doucette, published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc., for details about camcorders.)
First off, we think that digital camcorders are the way to go (look for formats
like Mini DV, MICROMV, or Digital 8 instead of an analog Hi8 format), for 
two reasons. First of all, these digital formats can take higher-quality, better-
looking, higher-resolution video and digital audio (which will look and sound
much better in your big-screen home theater). Second, digital camcorders
can connect to your PC through a standard FireWire cable (also known as
i.LINK or IEEE 1394) and transfer video to your computer’s hard drive for
editing. Editing is a key thing — no one wants to watch your “raw” video
footage, they want to see a nice finished product, without any mistakes, and
possibly with a soundtrack.
Connecting your camcorder to your home theater is really a simple process.
All these digital camcorders use standard S-Video connectors (which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 16).
If you use a camcorder in your home theater, we recommend you choose an
A/V receiver with a set of inputs for the camcorder on the front. With this
setup, you don’t have to monkey around behind the equipment rack when
you want to plug in your camcorder.
If you’re moving into the HDTV realm and you are a video camera enthusiast,
we suggest you look into the new category of high-definition camcorders.
There aren’t a lot of HD models on the market yet — the “market” here mean-
ing consumer HD camcorders. (There are a lot of professional models for TV
studios, filmmakers, and the like.) The models we list here are mainly in the
prosumer category, which means they are expensive and good enough for
entry-level professional use, but not so expensive that enthusiastic amateurs
won’t buy them:
 Sanyo’s HD1: Sanyo currently (as we write in early 2006) has the cheapest
HD-capable camcorder on the market, the HD1. This model can support
720p video (the actual resolution is 1280 x 760 pixels). Like a growing
number of video cameras, the HD1 does away with the tape and uses a
solid-state memory card (like a digital camera uses) to record video. You
can record up to 41 minutes of high-def video on this model using a 2GB
SD Card memory card. With a list price of $799.99, this is the cheapest 
HD-capable camcorder yet. You can find out more about this model at the
following URL:
88

ductID=1239
 Sony’s HDRFX1: Sony’s entry into the prosumer HD camcorder market
is a bit more expensive (okay, a big bit listing at $4,999.99, but available
on-line for closer to $3,200). This killer machine can record video at the
full 1080i resolution and features a killer lens, 3 CCDs (charge-coupled
devices — the chips that actually receive and digitize the image) for
better color reproduction, and more. An awesome camcorder if you can
swing the asking price.
Sony also has a cheaper model (with fewer bells and whistles, of course),
the HDR-HC1, which retails for under $1,800.
 JVC’s GR-HD1US: JVC offers a 1080i camcorder similar to Sony’s HDRFX1
model, the GR-HD1US. (Don’t worry, we won’t have a pop quiz on model
numbers at the end of the chapter!) With a list price of $3,499.95, this
may not be on everyone’s shopping list, but if you’re looking for true high
def, make sure you check out this model along with the Sony and Sanyo!
Video surveillance
Surveillance is kind of a scary word. We hesitate to use it because it sounds
kind of paranoid and big-brotherish. But it’s an accurate word for what we’re
talking about — video cameras mounted in and around your home that let
you keep an eye on what’s going on from the comfort of your home theater
(or any room with a television).
Surveillance video is not high-quality, surround sound video. In fact, most
surveillance video (often called closed circuit TV or CCTV) is pretty awful to
look at. But if you want to know who’s ringing the doorbell or keep an eye on
the baby asleep in her room while you watch a movie in the home theater,
then you probably don’t need a high-quality picture. Heck, you might not
even want a color picture . . . or sound. You just want to see what’s going on.
There are a couple of ways to get this home surveillance video into your
system:
 You can use a wireless system like those offered by X10. These sys-
tems (which start at around $80 at www.x10.com) use a 2.4 GHz radio
signal (like those used by many cordless phones) to send video from a
remote location to a small receiver that plugs into your home theater
receiver or directly into your TV. You might put one of these cameras by
your front door or use Danny’s favorite, X10.com’s FloodCam, which is
built into a set of motion-sensitive floodlights on the side of your house.
89
Chapter 6: Feeding Video into Your Theater

 You can use networked cameras that connect to your home’s computer
network. These systems, from companies like Panasonic and D-Link, are
a bit more expensive (starting at around $400 per camera) but are much
more capable. Using a standard (wired) Ethernet network or a wireless
computer network (802.11b/g or Wi-Fi), you can feed the video from
these cameras into your home theater PC, and you can even view them
from outside the home theater (if you have a broadband Internet connec-
tion) by using the built-in Web server on these cameras.
 You can use a traditional “wired” CCTV system. These cameras connect
to your home’s coaxial video cabling (the cable that brings antenna and
cable TV connections to your home theater, as we discuss in Chapter 18)
and use devices called modulators that let you turn this video into an in-
house TV station. To view a modulated CCTV channel, you just need to
tune your TV to the right channel. If you have a picture-in-picture system
in your TV, you can even keep an eye on things in a small window while
you watch something else on the rest of the screen.
These cameras are not only good for viewing, but for recording as well.
Danny likes the FloodCam because it records when motion sets it off, day or
night. You never know when you might need that.

Chapter 7
Feeding Your Home Theater 
from Outside Your Home
In This Chapter
 Aiming your home theater at the stars
 Connecting to cable
 Tuning your antennas
 Watching new network-based services
I
n the previous two chapters, we talk about a bunch of different audio and
video sources that let you enjoy prerecorded content (like movies on DVD
or music on CD) or content that you’ve created yourself (like home movies
and recordings you’ve made of broadcast TV). For most people, this kind of
content is just part of the overall home theater experience. You may also want
to use your cool A/V equipment to do standard couch potato stuff — watching
the big game or sitcoms on TV. In this chapter, we discuss the different ways
you can bring these “outside the house” sources into your home theater.
We talk about three primary ways you can get television into your home —
satellite, cable, and over-the-air broadcasts. We don’t think these three things
need to be mutually exclusive. You might, for example, get a satellite TV
system but also have an antenna to pick up local stations. Or you might 
get digital cable to pick up those mythical 500 stations but still hook up an
antenna to pick up the local HDTV broadcasts. So keep an open mind as you
plan your theater.
Some local phone companies are beginning to offer TV services, often using
fiber optic cables, which are replacing regular copper phone lines. In most
cases these services don’t (currently) differ all that much from the services
offered by cable TV providers — they connect to your TV the same way, 
use similar set-top boxes, and offer similar feature sets. In the future, how-
ever, these IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) services may offer a richer mix of
channels — on demand — and more cool features than either satellite or

cable. The biggest telephone company provider of TV services today is
Verizon (with its FIOS fiber optic deployments), and AT&T (formerly SBC) is
right behind them with something called Project Lightspeed. Keep an eye out
for your own phone company — pretty soon, we expect they’ll be competing
directly with your cable and satellite TV services.
Digital Satellite Does It All
For many home theater enthusiasts, TV means one thing: satellite TV. DSS
(Digital Satellite Service) is the way people do satellite today (many people
also call it DBS, Direct Broadcast Satellite). If you wanted satellite TV 20 or 
so years ago, you were stuck with something called C-Band (named after the
radio frequency on which these satellites operated), which required you to
put a huge (9-foot or so) satellite dish in your backyard.
DSS is a much more user- and landscape-friendly version of satellite TV. DSS
dishes can be as small as 18 inches across and are much easier to integrate
into the average backyard. Despite this more compact size, DSS has all the
advantages that drew people to those big dishes back in the ’80s — tons of
channels and interesting programming you can’t get from your local broad-
cast channels.
If your cable company offers a digital cable service (which we discuss in an
upcoming section), you can probably get just as many channels on that ser-
vice as you can on a satellite service.
Signing up for digital satellite
In the United States, the two main providers of DSS services are DirecTV and
Echostar (Echostar’s service is called DISH Network), and they are pretty simi-
lar. Both services offer digital transmission of their video content using MPEG-2
(discussed in Chapter 4). This digital transmission has advantages for both the
satellite companies (because it lets them fit more TV channels into the radio
waves over which their satellites broadcast) and the customer (because it
eliminates the distortions that often occur in nondigital transmissions).
Both DSS service providers are furiously launching new satellites into orbit,
outfitted with systems that can support the newer MPEG-4 system, which pro-
vides greater compression. After these new satellites are launched, both
providers will be able to use this expanded capacity to offer more high-
definition (HDTV) channels.
92
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

To pick up stations coming from these new MPEG-4 satellites, you need a new
satellite receiver. For DirecTV — who has begun broadcasting in a few cities
with MPEG-4 — this is the H20 receiver and the AT9 satellite dish, already
available. As we write, DISH hasn’t yet launched this service, so keep an eye
out on the DISH Web site for more details.
We like both services. To decide between the two, shop for pricing and chan-
nels that are best for you. You can look at channel lineups and prices on-line
at www.directv.com and www.dishnetwork.com.
Although DSS systems broadcast all their content using digital technology,
the majority of the programming sent out over these systems is analog TV, 
or NTSC, which we discuss in Chapter 4. However, DSS systems still carry a
relatively large number of HDTV stations, which is why many home theater
owners choose DSS as their primary source of television. The total number
carried is increasing month by month as new satellites come on-line, but is
still limited to about 20 or 25 channels — just a small percentage of the hun-
dreds of stations carried by these systems, but in many areas, that’s more
than are available by cable or broadcast.
Some of the key features of both DSS systems include
 Hundreds of channels, including movie, sports, and sometimes even
local broadcast channels
 On-screen program guides that include all the current and upcoming (for
a week or so) programming scheduled on the system
 Dozens of digital audio channels
 High-definition TV
Understanding the drawbacks
DSS services are pretty awesome, we think, but they do have a few draw-
backs. If you decide to go the DSS route, keep a few things in mind:
 You might not get local stations: In some parts of the country, you can
get a local package that includes most if not all of your local broadcast
stations. In some smaller cities and more rural areas, you still need to
get cable or set up a broadcast antenna to pick up local stations.
You won’t get the local stations in HDTV unless you are lucky enough to
be in one of the cities receiving the new MPEG-4 broadcasts discussed
earlier in this section. Most HD-capable DSS satellite receivers have
built-in over-the-air broadcast TV tuners that can pick up the HDTV sig-
nals being sent out by the TV stations in your town.
93
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home

 You need a special satellite receiver: You can’t just plug the cable from
your satellite dish into a TV; you need a special satellite receiver. You can
share this receiver with other TVs in your house, but if you want to watch
different programs on different TVs, you need a receiver for each TV.
 You need to hook into a phone line: Your satellite receiver has to “talk”
back to the service provider to maintain your pay-per-view account and
to check for software upgrades. The receivers usually do this in the
middle of the night, so they don’t interfere with phone calls. If you never
use pay-per-view or some of the premium sports channels, you may be
able to skip the phone line entirely. Check with the provider before you
buy in on this if getting a phone line in your home theater is an issue.
 Your satellite dish antenna must be able to “see” the satellites: It must
have a clear line of sight to the satellites, which hover over the equator.
Some folks in northern areas (or in Hawaii) might not be able to pick up
all the satellites, so they get only some of the channels, not all. Even if
you’re in the right spot, geographically speaking, you still need to have a
clear view to the south, without hills and trees (or even tall buildings) in
the way.
 You have to install the system: This isn’t a really big deal for most folks,
particularly when free installation deals are constantly being advertised. If
you don’t own your home, however, installation could be a deal breaker,
so check with your landlord first.
One more thing: You may run into some resistance from homeowners’ associ-
ations, neighborhood covenants, and the like. Don’t take this lying down. The
FCC ruled in 2001 that these “local” regulations can’t be used to prevent you
from installing a DSS dish. The only big exceptions are for safety (for exam-
ple, you can’t be too close to a power line) and for homes in historic districts.
You may also be restricted from attaching your dish to “common” areas like
shared exterior walls in condos. Otherwise, no one can keep you from using a
dish if you want to. Know your rights! Check out www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/
otard.html for the actual, long-winded text of this ruling.
Getting the dish on the dish
On your roof (or on the side of your house, or on top of a big rock in your
backyard — you can stick these things just about anywhere) goes an 18- to
30-inch round or oval satellite dish. This dish is your main link to those 
satellites floating around in space, so it has to be aimed properly to pick up
the signals. (By the way, this aiming is really the hardest part of the whole
installation — despite the existence of self-install kits, we think aiming is 
sufficiently hard that it warrants a professional installation.)
94
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Don’t buy the round dish if you’re getting a new DirecTV system. Only the
slightly larger oval dish picks up the HDTV signals available on that service.
For DISH Network, you need a second dish for HDTV, so this caveat doesn’t
apply.
Within this dish assembly are devices called LNBs, or Low Noise Blockers —
the horn-shaped dinguses that sit in front of the actual parabola of the dish.
These devices sift the high-frequency satellite signals out from other radio sig-
nals and block out the extraneous signals. Dishes can have one or more LNBs,
depending on what you want to do with them. (Dishes with more than one
LNB are referred to as dual-, triple-, or quadruple-LNB dishes — the newest
DirecTV dish, the AT9, has five LNBs.)
Deciding how many LNBs and what shape of antenna you want can be really
confusing. It depends on where you live, what service you are subscribing to,
and how many TVs you want your satellite to feed into. There’s no simple for-
mula because there are multiple variables (and we really hated that multiple
variable stuff back when we were in school).
One key factor to remember is that single-LNB dishes can feed only a single
DSS receiver. If you want to watch different programs on different TVs simul-
taneously, you need at least a dual-LNB dish. We recommend that you get at
least a dual-LNB dish; it’s a false economy to get the marginally cheaper
single-LNB dish.
If you subscribe to DirecTV, you should consider the five-LNB dish if you
want HDTV (or local channels in some parts of the country). DISH Network
uses a second dish for HDTV, so you won’t ever run into a triple-LNB dish for
that service.
Choosing a receiver
The television signals feeding in from a dish (or dishes) and through an LNB
(or LNBs) are in a format that basically no TV can decode and display. So
between the dish/LNB and your TV, you need to install a DSS receiver.
Although many things about DirecTV and DISH Network are similar, the
receiver is one area in which they diverge. DISH Network maintains tight con-
trol on the receiver business and sells its own brand of receivers directly to its
customers. (You can choose from several models in different price ranges.)
DirecTV has a more open outlook on the receiver business, so you can buy
your receivers from a range of companies, such as Sony, Samsung, and RCA.
95
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home

Regardless of how you get the receiver, you have a few decisions to make
before you buy. Right at the top of the list, you’re going to need to work out
whether or not you want a receiver that’s
 HDTV-capable: If you have an HDTV or an HDTV-ready monitor, you can
get the awesome high-definition programming through your DSS system.
If you don’t have one of these HDTV-capable TVs, you gain nothing from
an HDTV-capable DSS receiver. You may still want to buy one if a TV
upgrade is in your near future, but if you don’t plan to upgrade for sev-
eral years, we suggest you wait. Receiver prices are always dropping,
and you’ll probably get a much better deal in two years, even if you have
to get rid of your existing receiver.
 Home theater–capable: Any DSS receiver can be used in a home theater,
but some of the cheaper receivers don’t have the proper chips inside or
connectors on the back to provide the highest quality home theater
experience that DSS can offer. We highly recommend that you make sure
your DSS receiver has at least an S-Video connector on the back (we talk
about video connectors in Chapter 16), as well as a digital audio connec-
tor (coaxial or optical) for Dolby Digital surround sound (which some,
but not all, DSS programs include).
 PVR-equipped: Some DSS receivers now come with a built-in hard
drive–based PVR (personal video recorder). Although you can certainly
add your own PVR to a DSS-fed home theater, the integration of these
units is kind of nice because the program guide that lets you select what
show you want to watch live is well-integrated into the PVR’s recording
scheduling system. See Chapter 6 for a discussion of PVRs.
You might also want to keep an eye out for more prosaic features when
choosing a DSS receiver. For example, some receivers have better (and easier
to use) parental “lockout” controls that keep the kids from watching stuff you
don’t want them to watch. Others have remote controls based on RF (radio
frequencies) instead of IR (infrared), so you can control them without a direct
line of sight to the receiver. It always pays to check out the little details when
you’re making these investments. (By the way, the investment isn’t too steep.
You can find complete dish and two-receiver packages for under $200, but the
price can rise to $500 or more for each HDTV-capable receiver.)
A handful of TVs on the market don’t need an external receiver to connect 
to a DSS dish. Several manufacturers, most notably Thompson, make HDTVs
with built-in DSS receivers for DirecTV. (So far, DISH Network still requires a
separate receiver.) We’re not sure this setup is a good thing because it limits
your upgrade path and gives you twice as much to break down in a single
device. It does save room, however, if you’re tight on space.

Cable Cornucopia
The biggest competitor to the DSS companies comes from local cable compa-
nies, such as Time Warner, Comcast, and Cox Communications. Until recently,
most home theater buffs didn’t really consider cable TV to be much of a com-
petitor to DSS — old-fashioned analog cable systems didn’t offer nearly as
many channels (particularly when it came to movie channels) as the satel-
lites did. That fact has changed, however, with the advent of digital cable sys-
tems. These systems use MPEG-2 compression technology to carry analog
(NTSC) programming into your house, and many provide you with Dolby
Digital signals for at least some of the programming.
Lots of people confuse digital cable with HDTV, but for the vast majority of
channels, digital cable is not HDTV. Most cable companies offer a dozen or so
channels of HDTV over their digital cable systems (for example, Pat’s cable
company offers him 20 HDTV channels, out of about 500 total channels). But
the rest is just digitally compressed and transmitted analog NTSC TV.
Functionally, DSS and digital cable are very similar. Both offer hundreds of
channels, including tons of movie channels, pay-per-view movies, and every
iteration of the Discovery channel you can imagine (Discovery Brain Surgery
Channel, anyone?). Like DSS, digital cable includes a pretty on-screen interface
that lets you browse through TV listings, set reminder timers, and the like.
The way that digital cable connects to your A/V system is even very similar
to DSS. Digital cable requires a set-top box (equivalent to the DSS receiver)
that converts these digitally compressed MPEG-2 channels into analog NTSC
signals for your TV. And like DSS, if you want to get HDTV signals over digital
cable (if your cable company offers them), you need a special set-top box
with HDTV capabilities and HDTV connectors on the back, such as HDMI or
wideband component video.
A number of new HDTVs are coming with the equivalent of a built-in cable
set-top box. These DCR (or digital cable–ready) TVs use a small smartcard
known as the CableCARD, which you rent from your cable TV provider. With a
CableCARD, you can skip the set-top box, but you lose some of its features
like video on demand (VoD) and an on-screen cable guide. See the sidebar
titled “Can I see your CableCARD please?” for more information.
The big difference between DSS and digital cable, in our minds, is the fact
that DSS gives you a choice of receivers (that you have to pay for), whereas
digital cable gives you no choice. You rent the digital cable set-top box as
part of your monthly service fee, and you get what the cable company gives
you. The advantage of this approach is that the cable company has to fix or
replace your set-top box if it stops working, but the disadvantage is that you
really can’t pick a set-top box that has the features you want. Like Model Ts,
they come in any color you want, as long as it’s black.
97
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home

The other big difference between DSS and digital cable is one that we can’t
measure ourselves (we’d need to invest much of our book royalties on the test
gear), but which we’ve heard many industry experts tell us: Many cable com-
panies compress the analog NTSC signals carried over digital cable more than
the DSS providers do. Because MPEG-2 is what’s known as a lossy compression
technology (meaning that, when MPEG-2 files are uncompressed for viewing,
some of the original data is lost), this extra compression means your picture is
less sharp and detailed than it would be at a lower compression level.
It’s not all bad news, however. There are two big advantages to going with
digital cable over DSS:
 Digital cable systems always carry all your local channels (they’re
required to by law). You might even get local cable-only channels that
you’d never get over DSS or with a broadcast TV antenna.
98
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 
Can I see your CableCARD please?
Many of the newest HDTVs are DCR, or digital
cable–ready. When you buy one of these TVs,
you can plug the coaxial cable right from your
wall into the TV, entirely skipping the set-top
box. In order to get premium channels (like
HBO), you will need to rent a device from your
cable company known as a CableCARD, which
plugs into a CableCARD slot on your TV .
The CableCARD is a smartcard with an embed-
ded chip that can decrypt or descramble 
premium channels. Essentially, your cable com-
pany uses the CableCARD as a “mini” set-top
box, built right into your TV.
There are two variants of CableCARD technol-
ogy — CableCARD 1.0 and 2.0. As we write in
early 2006, only the 1.0 version is available. It’s
quite limited in its capabilities because it is a
one-way system. That means that it can only
descramble systems coming into your TV; it
can’t communicate back with the cable com-
pany, in other words. So you lose the on-screen
program guide, video on demand (VoD), and
other features that a true set-top box gives you.
Version 2.0, however, will supposedly give you
the two-way communications you need to get
these interactive TV features and will support
program guides, VoD, and other enhanced dig-
ital cable features.
Version 2.0 of the CableCARD is expected to hit
the market sometime in 2006 — though it’s not
clear how quickly it will be adopted.
We’re of mixed feelings about CableCARD. On
the one hand, we love the way it lets you
streamline your home theater — removing yet
another black or silver box from your equipment
rack. On the other hand, as it works today — the
1.0 version — it’s a bit limiting. For example, Pat
uses his cable set-top box as a DVR (see
Chapter 6), so there’s no advantage to him of
getting rid of the set-top box. (He’d just have to
go out and buy a separate DVR.)
When CableCARD 2.0 comes to market (and the
cable companies are only mildly interested —
they’d prefer to rent you a set-top box) things
will get more interesting. We can’t wait to see
CableCARD 2.0 TiVo DVRs and other devices
that can really make use of the system.

 Digital cable systems are two-way systems, communicating back to the
cable company over the same line that carries your cable TV to you.
So you don’t need a phone line (like you do with DSS), and you can actu-
ally do neat interactive TV stuff with digital cable. In many areas, you
can actually do video on demand (or VoD) over a digital cable system.
(We talk about VoD in more detail at the end of this chapter).
Another great feature of cable is that it is — generally speaking — immune 
to weather phenomena that can cause DSS services to freeze up or blur.
Obviously, a big storm could blow over the poles that carry your cable signal
into your home, but you won’t have to worry about heavy winds or rain
affecting your signal as you do with satellite.
Making a decision between DSS and digital cable is really tough. In some
parts of the country, it won’t be tough at all. Digital cable may not be avail-
able, or it may be in a primitive state (for example, no HDTV channels, no
VoD, and fewer channels than DSS). In these cases, it helps to have either a
good dealer or a lot of friends with home theaters so that you can judge dif-
ferent systems with your own eyes.
99
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home
What about analog cable?
Most cable companies now offer digital cable
service. They have to if they want to compete
with the DSS guys, and they can if they’ve
upgraded their cable plants to two-way in order
to offer cable modem Internet access (which
most cable companies have done). In some
areas, however, you’re still stuck with analog
cable. There’s nothing inherently wrong with
analog cable. It was good enough for the cable
TV industry to convince about 70 percent of
Americans to buy their service in the first place,
but it’s not a particularly sexy service. If you
need or want to get analog cable into your home
theater, there’s not a lot that needs to be done.
Any TV purchased in the past five to ten years
(and certainly any TV you may shop for when
building a home theater) is cable ready, with
one big exception: Some high-end TVs (such as
plasmas and front-projection models) ship as
monitors without any kind of TV tuner built in.
Besides this small group, any modern TV should
be able to plug directly into an analog cable
system and work without any extra pieces or
parts. In a few cable systems, you need a set-
top converter box (the analog equivalent to dig-
ital set-top boxes) in order to get pay-per-view
or certain movie channels — often called pre-
mium channels.
Although most home theater builders will move
up to digital cable or DSS, there’s still a place for
analog cable. For example, a basic analog cable
package (which might cost less than $20 a
month) is a good way to add all the local chan-
nels you want to receive to your DSS-based
home theater system — particularly if you live
in an area where over-the-air broadcast is
spotty, and you can’t get your local channels via
DSS. If Pat ever switches to DSS, he’s going to
keep his basic analog cable service for two rea-
sons: He has a cable modem that he can’t live
without, and he gets all the Padres games on
cable and can’t get them anywhere else.

Antennas Make a Comeback
Remember the good old days? Yeah, neither do we, but we can remember 
a day (not so long ago) when all the homes in our neighborhood sported
rooftop TV antennas, sort of like how many homes in our neighborhood now
sport rooftop DSS dishes. For most of us, the rooftop TV antenna (and its
close ally, the back-of-the-set rabbit ears) went the way of black and white
TVs and dodos a long time ago. Tuning in to broadcast TV was just too much
of a pain in the butt compared to the “plug and play” of cable (or the “have a
professional aim and then play” of DSS).
But a funny thing happened on the way to obsolescence. Antennas became
hip again. HDTV is the reason. (It’s always the reason for us, but we’re like
that.)
Moving everyone to ATSC and HDTV
HDTV is the reason because our good buddies at the FCC (the Federal
Communications Commission) came up with a ruling a few years back that
made a huge deal with every single TV broadcaster in the nation. The deal
was this: We’ll give you an extra chunk of the airwaves for a second TV chan-
nel absolutely free, but you have to use it to broadcast digital TV (and even-
tually you have to give us back your old channel so we can use it for other
purposes, like wireless Internet connections).
Now this deal was supposed to be totally complete by 2006. And when we say
totally, we mean that by 2006, every single station in America was supposed
to be broadcasting all of its programming digitally, using one of the many dif-
ferent digital TV (ATSC) formats. Well, as we write, that has not happened,
but most stations across the U.S. are now broadcasting both digital and
analog signals.
The next step in the digital TV transition is for the few remaining analog-only
holdouts to begin transmitting digital TV and then — the big step — for all
stations to turn off their analog broadcasts. The new deadline for this step 
is February 17, 2009. By that date, all of your older analog TVs will need a
(hopefully inexpensive) digital TV tuner that will pick up the over-the-air digi-
tal signals and convert them to an analog signal the older TVs can pick up. In
Chapter 13 we talk about TVs with built-in ATSC (digital TV) tuners — most
new TVs these days have this feature, and before 2009, all TVs with any kind
of tuner built-in will as well.
100
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

The government is helping the transition along. In the summer of 2002, the
FCC made a ruling that, by 2007, every TV sold in America must have a
receiver that can get ATSC broadcasts. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean that
these TVs will be able to display HDTV (for example, they might not have a
high enough resolution, or they may not be able to display widescreen con-
tent properly), but they will be able to receive it and display it at lower reso-
lutions and at a 4:3 aspect ratio. Eventually, when enough of these TVs are in
people’s homes, analog TV as we know it will go away, replaced by ATSC and
HDTV.
This transition has caused a revitalization of the TV antenna industry. 
DSS and (some) digital cable systems carry a few HDTV stations, but they
each have severe limitations to how many they can fit on their systems
because HDTV is a bandwidth hog. It uses a lot more bandwidth than NTSC
programming does — especially when the NTSC has been compressed using
MPEG-2 — and bandwidth is a limited commodity on cable and DSS systems.
To give more to HDTV means taking some away from something else. It’s a
zero sum game.
Sorry for the long background discussion, but we really felt it was important
to understand what’s happening before we discuss what you can do today.
Picking up ATSC with an antenna
Today, if you live in or around a large city, you can pick up ATSC program-
ming by hooking up an antenna and tuning it into your local broadcasters. If
you live in a smaller town, you just may have to wait it out for a while. The
costs of putting in the new transmission and other broadcast station equip-
ment to do ATSC are pretty high, and small stations are going to need fre-
quent and persistent applications of something like an electric cattle prod to
their posteriors to get it done.
Before you start investing in an antenna, check with your local broadcasters
and see who actually has their ATSC channels up and running. You can also
look on-line at www.hdtvpub.com. Just type in your zip code and find out
who’s broadcasting in your area.
The law requires these TV stations to broadcast in ATSC, not HDTV. HDTV 
is a subset of ATSC (check back in Chapter 4 if you missed this distinction).
Generally speaking, of the 18 formats allowed under ATSC, we consider only 
2 of them, 720p and 1080i, to be HDTV.
101
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Home Theater from Outside Your Home

We focus on ATSC antennas here, and not older NTSC antennas, but the same
general characteristics apply to each.
You can choose from both indoor and outdoor antennas. Indoor antennas
work just fine if you are lucky enough to live in an area with great signals
coming over the air, but most people get better results with outdoor anten-
nas. Outdoor antennas are further categorized by three features:
 Size: We won’t spend too much time explaining the concept of size to
you, but ATSC antennas fit into small, medium, and large groups.
 Directionality: Some antennas (multidirectional) can pick up signals
coming from any point of the compass, whereas others (directional)
need to be aimed toward the incoming signal.
 Amplification: Most antennas are unamplified (meaning they don’t have
an electronic signal booster), but for weak signals, some antennas use a
small preamplifier to boost the signals and help your TV tuner decode
them.
Tuning in over-the-air HDTV can be a tricky business. The good news is that
digital broadcasts are free of the snow, fade, and other things that made
broadcast analog TV so frustrating. The bad news is that in place of these dis-
tortions, digital broadcasts tend to be, well, digital. In other words, they’re
either on (working) or off (nothing, nada, zip). It’s not even a matter of just
being too far from the broadcast tower either. We’ve heard of people being
too close, or people being in the right range, but behind a hill.
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has developed a great system
to help you figure out which kind of antenna you need to get ATSC signals in
your home. Go to its Web site at www.antennaweb.org, type in some basic
address information, and its database spits out an antenna recommendation
for you. The CEA even has a color coding system that participating antenna
manufacturers put on the outside of their boxes so you can choose the right
one at the store. Very handy.
Neat Network-based Services
As service providers (such as cable companies) have spent their billions of
dollars building broadband networks for Internet access and digital cable,
they’ve come across one big issue: They need to make money to pay back this
investment. So they are constantly looking for new services that take advan-
tage of these high-speed networks — services they can charge users for.
Well, we’re often leery when service providers try to charge us more (well,
not really; our day job is helping them figure out what these services might
be!), but we definitely think that these new services are a case in which the
102
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

customer also wins. These companies are looking at offering lots of different
entertainment services (including neat stuff such as video games on demand),
but the two most interesting (in our minds) are the following:
 Video on demand (VoD): Like to watch movies, but hate to go to the
video store? One alternative is to join a service that does movie rentals
on-line (and via the U.S. mail), like Netflix (www.netflix.com). Another
very cool way to watch movies is to use a VoD service (now being
offered by many cable companies as a part of digital cable services).
VoD is kinda like pay-per-view (PPV). You pay for individual movies and
shows, and you watch them on your cable-connected TV. But the similar-
ities end there because VoD movies aren’t run as scheduled broadcasts
(like every hour on the hour). Instead, VoD movies are stored on big
computers (video servers) as MPEG-2 files. When you want to watch
one, you simply select it on your on-screen guide and press Play on your
remote. The movie gets streamed to your set-top box (just like movies
you watch on the Internet, but at a much higher quality), and played
back on your TV. You have complete control of the stream, so, just like
using a VCR or DVD player, you can start, stop, pause, fast forward, and
rewind — the works — all for the same cost as regular PPV. One other
neat VoD service is called SVoD (subscription VoD), which allows you 
to subscribe to a certain channel or show, such as HBO, and get VoD
access to all the episodes of a favorite show (such as The Sopranos).
 Networked PVRs: This is a more futuristic service, but it’s on the verge
of appearing on the market. Networked PVR is a cross between regular
personal video recorders (PVRs), such as ReplayTVs, and VoD. Like a
PVR, a networked PVR records the shows you want to save on a big
computer hard drive. But like VoD, this big computer hard drive is
located in the service provider’s office, not in your home theater. So you
tell the system what you want to save, and it saves it in a centralized
location. When you want to watch, you just click a button on your
remote, and the programming is streamed to your TV over the cable
company’s broadband network. You can still do all the fast forward and
pause type stuff you do on a regular PVR, but you have no extra boxes in
your home theater and nothing to buy (you will have to pay a monthly
fee for this, of course).
You might even see your phone company (believe it or not) get into these
services. Phone companies are investigating new high-speed technologies
(such as faster versions of the DSL Internet service they offer now, and even
faster fiber optic–based services) that will allow them to compete with the
cable companies. It seems fair enough, considering that cable companies are
now starting to offer Internet access and long distance services. We can’t
wait for some competition!

Introducing the Home Theater PC
In This Chapter

 Getting music, movies, and more from the Internet
F
or years now, there has been a huge digital divide between the PC world
and the consumer electronics world. You have no doubt been exposed 
to the concept of multimedia in a PC in the form of animations, video games,
MP3 audio, and maybe even short movie clips. Indeed, the ability to play these
forms of media is a basic requirement of a multimedia PC.
Similarly, consumer electronics devices have been enabling much of the same
entertainment content (video games, audio, video, and so on), but within its
domain — the home entertainment center or home theater.
What most people have been waiting for is a sensible, economical, standard-
ized, and indeed mass-market way to link the two. Well, wait no more — the
era of the home theater PC is here and now.
In this chapter, we talk about what a home theater PC is, what kinds of pieces
and parts you need to create a home theater PC out of your present PC, and
also how you can buy a home theater PC right off the shelf (or off a Web
page). We also talk a little about the kinds of content (audio and video) that
your home theater PC can feed into the rest of your A/V gear in your home
theater (and vice versa).
Meet the Home Theater PC
You should think of a home theater PC (or HTPC, as all the cool kids refer to
them) as a high-quality source device attached to your A/V system, just as
you think of a DVD player as a high-quality source. In fact, if you go relatively

high end, you can create an HTPC that funnels audio and video into your
system at a higher quality level than many moderately priced, standalone
components. HTPC can be that good.
Building an HTPC is not something you can expect to do without a fair
amount of knowledge about PCs, including some skills at opening up a PC
and installing new cards and drives and being able to install and troubleshoot
drivers (the software that integrates hardware devices with the operating
system of a PC) and other software. We simply don’t have room in this book
to give you all the nitty-gritty details, but we will give you a good grounding
in the essential pieces and parts you need to build your own HTPC. If you
don’t want to build your own, you can buy a ready-to-go version of the HTPC
off the shelf (and we explain how later in this chapter).
Sizing up a home theater PC
Depending on your needs, a home theater PC should be able to do some or
all of the following things:
 Store audio (music) files. No matter the file type, HTPCs need hard
drive space and software for audio files.
 Store video clips. Homemade camcorder movies, downloaded movie
trailers, or even downloaded full movies and TV shows belong on the
HTPC. You need (again) hard drive space and software to make this
happen.
 Play CDs and DVDs. This is an easy requirement because most PCs 
can at least play back CDs, but DVD is also essential in a home theater
environment.
 Act as a DVR (digital video recorder). This is an optional (but almost
essential, we think) function that uses the HTPC’s hard drive to record
television shows — essentially making it act like a TiVo or your cable or
satellite provider’s DVR.
 Let you play video games on the big screen. With the right hardware,
PCs are sometimes even better than gaming consoles (which we cover 
in Chapter 9) in terms of game-type stuff, such as frames per second (or
things blown to bits per millisecond).
 Tune in to on-line music and video content. You can grab a lot of really
awesome content on the Internet these days. If you pay for this content
(and you do have to pay for the good stuff, legally speaking), why not
enjoy it on the big screen and with the good audio equipment?
 Provide a high-quality, progressive video signal to your display. All
PCs have a built-in video system that’s designed to display on a PC moni-
tor (which, by the way, is inherently progressive — check out Chapter 4
106
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

if you don’t remember what this is). Most PCs, however, can’t display on
a TV, at least not at high quality. An HTPC needs special hardware —
which doesn’t cost too much money — to make this happen. (This
investment also gives you better performance on your PC’s monitor,
which is never bad.)
 Decode and send to your display HDTV content. This is another
optional function, but a really cool one. With the right hardware inside
(an HDTV-capable video card and TV tuner card), HTPCs can provide a
cheap way to decode over-the-air HDTV signals and send them to your
home theater display.
Building an HTPC
If the idea of putting together your own HTPC puts a twinkle in your eye, then
this section is for you (and the HTPC we describe here really involves a build-
ing process — although there’s an increasing number of small, specialty PC
builders, like the folks at www.digitalconnection.com, who will put one
together for you). So what do you need besides steady hands, nerves of steel,
and a handy dandy TORX screwdriver or two? Well, let us tell you. The key
pieces and parts to any HTPC are the following:
 Fast processor: Generally, you need a fast Pentium IV processor (prefer-
ably 2.0 GHz or faster) or an equivalent AMD processor. You can get
away with less, but you might have performance issues (such as DVDs
having artifacts, or leftover or poorly presented pixels, on the screen
because the PC can’t keep up decoding the DVD’s MPEG content).
 Sufficient RAM: For an HTPC, you need at least 512MB of RAM, and 1GB
or more is a good idea.
 A big hard drive: If you’re not planning on saving a lot of video on 
your HTPC (meaning you won’t be using it as a PVR — personal video
recorder), you can probably get by with an 80GB hard drive. If you are
going to start doing the PVR thing (or if you’re going to put a lot of MP3
files on the HTPC), we recommend a much bigger hard drive. You can
buy a 250GB drive for about $150, and even go as big as 500GB for under
$400 (that’s huge!).
 A powerful, high-quality video card with an appropriate TV interface:
This is perhaps the most important feature. You need a graphics card
that has TV outputs (at least an S-Video output, preferably component
video outputs). If you’re using a front-projection TV system (see Chap-
ter 13), you might be able to use a different interface (like a VGA or 
DVI cable) that is more common to PC applications than home video
(because many projectors can also be used as PC projectors — in meet-
ing rooms, for example). We like the graphics cards available from ATI
107
Chapter 8: Introducing the Home Theater PC

(www.ati.com) and NVIDIA (www.nvidia.com). Some specific things
to look for in a video card are the following:
• Look for a card with a built-in video processing engine (or VPE).
These are specifically designed for video.
• Don’t look for a gaming card. Super-high-end graphics cards designed
for the ultimate in PC gaming are typically not optimized for video
display. They work, but you can probably do better with a (cheaper)
card designed for video.
• Look for a card with a built-in TV tuner. Some products, like ATI’s
“All-in-Wonder” series of cards, have a built-in cable-ready TV tuner,
so you can plug your cable TV or broadcast antenna directly into
the card for TV viewing. Many cards have built-in ATSC tuners (see
Chapter 7 for more on this topic) so you can tune in high-definition
TV channels. Unfortunately, we don’t know of any cards that can
handle DSS or digital cable. Sorry.
With the launch of the Windows Vista operating system in 2007
(see the sidebar, “Looking forward to Vista”), Microsoft will be sup-
porting the CableCARD standard (discussed in Chapter 7). With a
CableCARD built into your HTPC, you will be able to subscribe to
digital cable services (including HDTV services if your video card
and tuner support HDTV) directly from your PC. We’re definitely
waiting with bated breath on this one.
• Think about HDTV. A growing number of HTPC video cards now
have built-in TV tuners that are capable of capturing ATSC/HDTV
over-the-air broadcasts. These cards are capable of sending video
to your display at an HDTV resolution (such as 720p or 1080i). So if
you want to feed HDTV into your HTPC (wow, acronyms galore —
sorry!), you need to add an HDTV tuner card (like ones made by
AccessDTV — www.accessdtv.com).
• Check the resolutions of the card. If you have a non-HDTV-ready dis-
play unit (like a regular NTSC direct-view TV), you need only a 480-
line output (with progressive scan, if your TV can handle it). If you
have a projection TV or a plasma flat-panel TV, it may have a native
resolution (which we discuss in Chapters 13 and 14). Make sure
your card can display video at this resolution (you normally set
the resolution of the card by using software bundled with your
video card).
 A high-end audio card: Because you’ll probably be playing surround
sound formats on your HTPC, you’ll want an audio card that can support
this. Audio cards may have either a coaxial or an optical output. (Make
sure you get one that has the same kind as what you have on the back of
your receiver.) Many sound card manufacturers call this an S/PDIF
(Sony/Philips Digital Interface) interface.

Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 A CD/DVD-ROM drive: This one is kind of a no-brainer — you’re going
to want to listen to CDs and watch DVDs. You might, however, also want
to create your own CDs and DVDs, so consider a DVD-RW/DVD+RW drive
(that can record DVDs). If you have a slower PC, you might consider
adding a hardware device called a DVD decoder — this device performs
hardware-based decoding of the MPEG video on DVDs, leaving your
computer’s main processor free to do its thing (like running the operat-
ing system). You can get DVD decoders from companies like Creative
Labs and Sigma Designs (www.sigmadesigns.com).
 An appropriate operating system: We recommend that you use a
modern operating system, such as Windows XP/Vista or Macintosh OS
X. (If you use Linux, you’re on your own — though we give a few tips in
the section titled “Got Linux?”.)
 Software for playing or recording content: At a minimum, you need
some MP3 jukebox software to take care of your CD/MP3 playing, stor-
age, and organization needs, and a similar DVD player program. For
music, we like MUSICMATCH Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com) or
iTunes (www.apple.com), and for video, we like InterVideo WinDVD
(www.intervideo.com) — and don’t forget that Microsoft’s built-into-
the-system Windows Media Player does a great job with both audio and
video. A great free option is the VLC Media Player (VideoLAN Client;
www.videolan.org/vlc), available for Mac, Windows, and Linux! If
you want to use your HTPC as a PVR, you need some software (and per-
haps hardware) to make that work, which we talk about in the following
section.
 A remote control: Now, very few PCs come out-of-the-box with a remote
control, but many of the HTPC video and audio cards we’ve discussed
do. The key attribute of any remote for an HTPC is that the accompany-
ing software can control all your applications — MP3 jukebox, DVD
player software, and so on. (All these remotes come with software that
makes the PC recognize them.)
109
Chapter 8: Introducing the Home Theater PC
Getting a TV tuner in your PC
While many HTPC video cards include a built-in
TV tuner, you can also add a TV tuner to your
HTPC separately. In fact, even if your video card
has a tuner, you may want to add an additional
TV tuner to your PC so that you can record one
program while watching another (or record two
at once). Some folks even go beyond two and
put three or more tuners in their HTPCs.
You can add tuners in two ways: You can install
an internal card that fits into one of your PC’s
PCI card slots, or you can add an external tuner
card that plugs into a USB 2.0 or FireWire port
on your PC. If you’re making a laptop PC into an
HTPC, you’ll probably need to use an external
tuner card because most laptops don’t have a
PCI slot for internal cards.

We’re focusing on the Windows operating system here, but Apple Macintosh
computers can also make great HTPCs, with the right accessories and soft-
ware. See the section, “Putting a Mac in your home theater,” for more infor-
mation about Mac-based HTPCs. That’s really all there is to say (at our
high-level view) about HTPCs. In Chapter 17, we discuss what you need to do
to get this beautiful, high-tech monster hooked into your home theater.
Getting an HTPC the Easy Way
What if you don’t want to go through all this computer building? Well, your
friends at Microsoft (really, they’re your friends) got together with a handful
of their closest PC hardware partners and came up with their own version of
the HTPC called the Windows XP Media Center Edition (www.microsoft.
com/windowsxp/mediacenter).
Media Center (we’re just going to shorten the name to that) is both software
(XP Media Center Edition 2005 operating system) and hardware (the Media
Center PC). One big deal about Media Center is that it’s like the old Frank
Sinatra song, “Love and Marriage”: You can’t have one without the other. You
can get the Media Center operating system only by purchasing a brand new
PC that has been outfitted specifically to be a Media Center PC.
You can’t go to Microsoft.com and buy a “media center upgrade” for your
existing Windows XP PC. You gotta buy a new machine.

Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 
Understanding Viiv
At the annual CES (consumer electronics show)
in 2006, Intel began showing prototypes of
devices built on its new Viiv architecture. Viiv is
based on the new dual core Pentium chips, but
it includes a whole range of hardware, soft-
ware, and even service components (meaning
that various entertainment providers are creat-
ing music, video, and other entertainment ser-
vices that work specifically with Viiv-based
equipment).
Viiv will be the technological underpinning of
new Media Center PCs (discussed in the sec-
tion titled “Getting an HTPC the Easy Way”) and
HTPCs, as well as new non-PC devices like
home media servers, TV set-top boxes, and
more. For more information on Viiv as well as a
list of Viiv-enabled PCs, check out the following
URL: www.intel.com/products/viiv/
index.htm.

What do you get out of a Media Center PC? Well, the details (such as the
exact model of graphics card) depend upon the vendor, but the basic fea-
tures of a Media Center PC include the following:
 A remote control: All Media Center PCs come with an infrared remote
control that lets you control the various A/V functions from across the
room (including other devices, such as cable boxes).
 An “advanced” graphics card: We put advanced in quotes because
that’s Microsoft’s official term for describing it. Can’t argue with strong
words like that! Most of the Media Center PCs we’ve seen use something
like NVIDIA’s GeForce 6600 GT or ATI’s Radeon 9200 or 9800 PRO graph-
ics cards (which are cards you might purchase if you were building your
own HTPC). These “advanced” cards must include a TV tuner function
and a TV output for connecting to your display.
 A hardware encoder: This turns video from your TV source (like cable
TV) into MPEG digital video and turns your Media Center PC into a PVR.
 A digital audio output: As we discuss in the preceding section, this lets
you connect your PC to your A/V receiver for surround sound purposes.
 Software that makes it all work: This is the cool part (well, the whole
thing is cool, but this makes it even cooler). Software to play your MP3s,
CDs, and DVDs, and to run your PVR is all included and well integrated.
So you don’t have to bend over backward to make it all work.
111
Chapter 8: Introducing the Home Theater PC
Looking forward to Vista
Microsoft will be launching the replacement for
Windows XP — Windows Vista — sometime in
2007. When they do, the Media Center Edition
name will be retired, but the functionality will
remain. While we haven’t seen any official prod-
uct announcements as we write in early 2006,
we have seen Microsoft’s official Vista lineup.
There will be six different variants of Windows
Vista (up from three for XP — professional,
home, and Media Center Edition). The top two
“consumer” variants of Vista will contain the
functionality that is now included in Media
Center Edition: Vista Home Premium (which
adds Media Center to the rest of the standard
“home” Vista features), and Vista Ultimate
(which includes everything and the kitchen 
sink — all the business and home features of
Windows Vista plus Media Center). We don’t yet
know how these software bundles will be pack-
aged up for consumers, but we expect that if
you don’t currently have a Media Center Edition
PC, you’ll need to buy a new PC to get the
Premium or Ultimate package. Even if an
upgrade is offered, we expect that the hard-
ware requirements of Premium and Ultimate
will be pretty steep and will rule out all but the
newest PCs.

A Media Center PC acts just like a regular PC most of the time. You use it for
e-mail, Web surfing, writing books, and whatever. But when you click the
remote, the PC shifts over to Media Center mode, and your normal PC desk-
top is replaced by a simplified interface (designed to be read from across the
room on either a PC display or a home theater display). You can perform all
the HTPC functions we discuss earlier in the section, “Sizing up a home the-
ater PC,” and also play games, manage and display digital photographs, and
more. Very cool.
There are dozens of Media Center PC vendors as we write, and more hit the
market every month. The coolest model we’ve seen so far is the Alienware
DH-5 (www.alienware.com). Check it out; this baby can support up to three
TV tuners (so you can record two shows and watch a third at the same time!)
and can record up to 500 hours of video on its internal hard drives. Plus, it
looks just like a piece of home theater gear and not like a bland beige PC.
Other HTPC Software Packages
Media Center Edition is the most popular (and easiest) way to get a Media
Center PC, but it’s not the only such package out there. You can add HTPC
software and hardware to a Windows PC, or even build an HTPC using a
Macintosh or a Linux-powered PC.
Building a Windows HTPC
You can build a home theater PC by using one of the following solutions (and
these aren’t even the only ones out there, only the most popular!):
112
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 
Coming soon: Media servers
While HTPCs and Windows XP Media Center
Edition PCs are really just what their names say
they are — PCs — there’s a new generation of
computer-like devices hitting the market that
will do many of the same things in a more con-
sumer-friendly fashion. Media servers are 
what we call them (and what most people call
them — we’re not just making this stuff up). 
A media server is really just a souped-up ver-
sion of a standalone PVR (such as a TiVo) or a
standalone MP3 server (such as an Audio
ReQuest). The media server doesn’t run a PC
operating system and doesn’t do normal PC
stuff. It just serves up media (hence the name).
We expect consumer electronics companies,
such as Sony and Toshiba, to start selling media
servers any day now. You’ll be able to hook them
into your PC network and into your home the-
ater and use them to store music, video, digital
photographs, and more.

 BeyondTV (www.snapstream.com): BeyondTV is SnapStream’s media
center/DVR software system. It offers a free on-screen program guide,
customized to your area, and support for multiple TV tuners (for record-
ing more than one program at a time). BeyondTV supports HDTV view-
ing and recording. One really neat feature of BeyondTV is its remote
recording feature that lets you log in and set up recordings from any
Web browser, including those found on many mobile phones! An
optional component, BeyondMedia, allows you to control all of the
media on your PC via SnapStream’s interface and your remote control.
The price ranges from $69.99 for the basic BeyondTV application, up to
$199.99 for the full bundle that includes the BeyondMedia software and a
TV tuner card.
 SageTV (www.sagetv.com): SageTV is a cool media center application
that can control your TV, DVR, music, video, and photos. One feature
that we really like about SageTV is its ability to work across a home 
network — so you can easily access media located on any PC attached to
your home’s wired or wireless network. You can even access and control
the TV tuners located on other networked computers, creating, in effect,
a whole-home DVR system that spans all of your TV tuner–equipped PCs.
 Pinnacle Media Center (www.pinnaclesys.com): Pinnacle sells both
hardware and software — TV tuners and DVR/media center software.
Their top-of-the-line software system, Pinnacle Media Center, is included
with their PCTV 110i and PCTV 100e tuners (these are internal and exter-
nal USB tuners, respectively). The internal (110i) version runs $79.99,
and the external version lists for $99.99.
Putting a Mac in your home theater
Apple has launched it’s own answer to the Windows XP Media Center Edition.
Called Front Row, it’s a media center (in the generic sense) application built
right into the Macintosh OS X (10.4 Tiger) operating system. Front Row is a
combination of software (the Front Row software) and hardware (in particu-
lar, Apple’s elegant new remote control) that works with the inherent media
capabilities of Apple’s hardware and software to present audio, pictures,
downloaded and/or home video, and DVDs on your Mac’s display or an
attached TV.
What Front Row doesn’t include is any functionality for watching or record-
ing TV. For that, you need to add some hardware and software, like Miglia’s
Evolution TV ($279, www.miglia.com) or Elgato’s EyeTV 500 ($349, www.
elgato.com). These systems include external TV tuner and decoder hard-
ware (which connect to your Mac’s USB or FireWire ports) and DVR software
that turn your Mac into a full-fledged DVR.
113
Chapter 8: Introducing the Home Theater PC

The Front Row software (everything minus the DVR, in other words) is avail-
able only from Apple — it’s standard on several Mac models, including (as we
write) the iMac, the Intel-powered MacBook Pro, and the Intel-powered Mac
Mini. There’s no additional charge for Front Row, it just comes as a standard
feature of these models. We expect Apple will add Front Row to more models
over time, and we also wouldn’t be surprised to see Mac hardware that uses
Front Row and adds in the DVR and TV capabilities that you have to add in
today.
By the way, you don’t have to stick just to Front Row. Straight from the folks
at Elgato comes Elgato’s EyeHome ($199), which includes a remote controlled
hardware device that you can place anywhere on your home network and
control from any Mac on your network. EyeHome includes all of the cool
audio/video/photograph features you’d expect, and also includes a Web
browser connection that lets you view Web sites on your big-screen TV in the
home theater. Our tech editor uses EyeHome and he loves it. And he’s a smart
guy, so you should listen to him!
Got Linux?
If you are running a PC with the Linux operating system instead of Windows,
you don’t have to give up on creating an HTPC. In fact, one of the most popu-
lar HTPC media center software packages is available only for the Linux OS —
MythTV (www.mythtv.org). Check the MythTV site to see if the software
will work on your particular Linux distribution and hardware.
Like most Linux software, MythTV comes with a great price — it’s free! And
also like many Linux programs, it’s updated constantly. While the basic
MythTV software is designed solely for DVR TV control functionality, the
open source nature of MythTV means that other folks can develop additional
functionality for the product — and they have, creating plug-ins to do other
HTPC/media center functions like photo viewing, music playback and man-
agement, and more.
The best place to get more info about MythTV is on the MythTV wiki, at the
following URL: www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
By the way, if you’re not familiar with wikis, check out http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki. This site explains the concept and uses of 
the wiki, which is basically an on-line encyclopedia format that allows multi-
ple users to add and edit entries — a community-maintained encyclopedia or
data source. They can be really handy!

 Powering up your games with a PC
 Controlling your games
T
oday’s video gaming systems are crammed full of high-powered audio
and graphics chips that can put your home theater through its paces.
With DVD-based games, you get audio that can use all the speakers in your
surround sound system and video that can fill up your screen. Video games
aren’t just kids’ toys anymore; they can be an integral part of your home 
theater experience!
In this chapter, we talk about how video consoles can fit into your home theater
system. (Okay, we realize some folks think they shouldn’t play any role what-
soever, but we disagree — as you’ll soon discover.) We talk about the leading
console systems as well as how you might bring PC gaming systems into your
home theater. By the way, we think game consoles are the best way to bring
gaming to the big screen, but if you’re handy with your PC, you can get a great
gaming experience with a gaming PC as well.
Integrating Cool Consoles 
into Your Home Theater
If you have (or are considering buying) a modern gaming console, such as an
Xbox 360 or the forthcoming PlayStation 3, you really need to be thinking about
how you plan to integrate it as a source device (in other words, a device that
provides audio and video) into your home theater. Yeah, we know — some
“high end” home theater folks might be cringing right now. Let ’em. We think
video games fit into even top-of-the-line home theaters.

Game consoles are, of course, built for video games, but if you’re not deep of
pocket, you might even think about letting your game console do double duty
as your DVD player (yep, they can do that), at least until you’ve saved up the
money for a nice, new, upconverting, standalone DVD player (as discussed in
Chapter 6). Most of the consoles we discuss here can replace a DVD and/or
CD player in your home theater, and more importantly, all of them can be a
heck of a lot of fun. In the following sections, we give you an overview of the
different consoles and how you can integrate them into your home theater.
When we say a game console is fast, we’re not talking about how many MHz
the processor operates at or other computer-centric measures of speed
(though these are very important). Rather, we’re talking about how much
information the console can push up onto the TV screen when it’s playing a
game. (Okay — when you’re playing a game and the console is processing the
game.) Most experts use the number of polygons per second as a measure-
ment for speed, and that’s a pretty good measure, although some gaming
experts use other graphics measurements.
Playing with Sony’s PlayStations
Sony has been leading the way in the game console world for years now, first
with the its popular PlayStation, then with the PlayStation 2, and soon with
the PlayStation 3. (The names don’t get any more original as time goes by, but
the performance remains truly exceptional!)
PlayStation 2
The most popular gaming console to date has been Sony’s PlayStation 2
(known among the In Crowd as PS2). This cool black-and-purple box has a
300 MHz processor under the hood, which might not sound like much in PC
terms, but this processor is especially designed for gaming and can really
crank out the video. The processor includes secondary processors, called
floating point processors, that help the PS2 do the math on all of a game’s
polygons (remember polygons from geometry?) at supercomputer speeds.
Besides this high-powered processor, the PS2 includes a bunch of additional
features:
 A powerful graphics chip: The Graphics Synthesizer chip does the actual
work of creating all the pixels (or colored dots) that show up on your TV
screen as the game video. For you tech types out there, this is a 256-bit
graphics chip.
 32MB of RAMBUS: RAMBUS is a high-speed type of RAM or computer
memory, and it holds all the computer instructions and codes that make
up the game.
 A DVD-ROM drive: This drive plays the optical discs containing the PS2
games and can also play PlayStation 1 games, movie DVDs, and CDs.
116
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 Lots of ports and connections: You get the following:
• Two gaming controller ports (The controllers are the physical
interface between you and the game.)
• Two USB ports
USB stands for Universal Serial Bus — like on a PC.
• Two memory card slots (to store game data, such as your current
level in a game), as well as an expansion bay that lets you install a
computer hard drive for even more storage
• A single i.LINK port (Sony’s name for IEEE 1394 or FireWire — a
super-high-speed connection used for all sorts of computer-related
devices, such as hard drives and digital video cameras) that lets
you connect multiple PS2s together for head-to-head gaming
We talk about these fancy connections in Chapter 16.
You can also buy an on-line gaming connection kit for the PS2 that lets you
connect your PS2 console to the Internet to play games against other people
who aren’t anywhere near your home theater. Neat. See the section, “Playing
games on-line.”
You can find out more about the PS2 (and the hundreds of games available
for it) on-line at www.playstation.com.
Coming soon: PlayStation 3
The really exciting news (and as we write it’s still “crystal ball” type news, as
the final specifications haven’t been announced) is the PlayStation 3 (or PS3).
The PS3 is Sony’s next-generation gaming console designed specifically for
high-performance gaming in a home theater with an HDTV display. (Say that
three times fast.) The PS3 is built around an entirely new kind of CPU called the
Cell processor, designed by IBM with a little help from Sony and Toshiba. The
Cell processor has multiple independent processing sections (called Synergistic
Processing Elements, if you want to get technical) that give the PS3 the ability 
to render video at rates previously unheard of for consumer-grade computing
devices. You’ve probably heard various PC and gaming manufacturers describe
their systems as “supercomputer-like” over the years — this one truly is.
The PS3 will also include a Blu-ray disc player (see Chapter 6), so it can sup-
port high-definition optical discs for playing movies, and the capacity of Blu-
ray (well over 20GB of data per disc) will let game makers cram a ton of detail
into their game software.
PS3 will also include built-in wireless networking (so you can easily connect
to Internet on-line gaming services through your Wi-Fi network), a powerful
graphics chip (developed by NVIDIA), and an array of outputs to hook into
your home theater.
117
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

Most importantly, PS3 will have two HDMI outputs for connecting to your high-
definition display and optical and coaxial digital audio outputs for connecting
to your A/V receiver for Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1-channel surround sound.
We can’t wait! Unfortunately, we have been waiting; as we write, Sony has
offered no firm date for the launch of the PS3, but most folks in the know
expect it in late 2006 — though this date has been delayed a few times. So
we’ll believe it when we can get our hands on a unit!
Xbox marks the spot
Microsoft hasn’t just let Sony own the gaming console business. In fact,
they’ve quickly established themselves as the number-two console maker
and may move ahead of Sony with their latest console, the Xbox 360 — which
beat the PS3 to market by at least six months.
Xbox
Until late 2001, PS2 was the king of the hill, the A#1, the fastest game console
you could wrap your mitts around. Nothing faster . . . anywhere.
In November 2001, however, Microsoft launched its own competing game
console — the Xbox (www.xbox.com). If you’ve ever picked one up and tried
to move it around, you probably already know that this is a serious chunk of
hardware. But the Xbox isn’t just a big lump of metal — it’s a seriously fast
gaming console with faster-than-the-PS2 chips that have made it a serious
contender to the PS2.
When comparing the Xbox and the PS2, most gaming geeks have found that
the Xbox is a bit faster and more powerful. Not a lot faster, but if you have a
high-resolution display (such as an HDTV) and are playing the same game,
you’ll probably find the video on the Xbox to be a bit sharper.
Not surprisingly, because Microsoft is primarily a PC software company, the
Xbox has a lot in common with a Windows PC. However, everything has been
altered, modified, and tweaked for gaming, and you can’t use an Xbox to write
a book in Microsoft Word. Intel builds the main processor, which is a 733 MHz
variant of the Pentium III PC processor. More PC hardware can be found in the
Xbox in the form of the graphics processor, dubbed the X Chip, which NVIDIA
builds and which is a variant of the company’s GeForce 3 PC video cards.
Other cool features of the Xbox include
 A built-in 8GB hard drive (like a PC hard drive): You can use the drive
to save game data or to store audio tracks ripped from your own CDs so
that you can customize your game soundtracks with your own favorite
music. (Ripping is the process of converting CD audio to files on the
hard drive, like the creation of MP3 music files.)
118
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 64MB of high-speed RAM: This is good for holding the game data that
the Pentium processor and NVIDIA chip are processing.
 A built-in Ethernet port: Ethernet is the high-speed (10 Mbps) network-
ing system that most computer networks use. Ethernet is also the con-
nection found on the majority of DSL and cable modems for home
high-speed Internet, and this port lets you connect your Xbox to the
Internet for on-line gaming — as we discuss in the section, “Playing
games on-line.”
 A DVD optical drive for games, CDs, and video DVDs: Unlike the PS2,
however, the Xbox can’t play video DVD out-of-the-box — you need to
pay about $30 for a remote control and adapter (which plugs into one of
the controller ports) to make this work.
 Ports and slots: You get four USB-type game controller ports (two more
than the PS2) for multiplayer games, as well as a slot for an 8MB memory
card.
What’s really cool about the Xbox from a home theater perspective is the fact
that the Xbox is the first console that can display its games on 1080i high-
definition TV. (It has been joined in this capability by the Xbox 360, which we
discuss next — the PS3, whenever it comes out, will also have this ability.)
This means that you can have some really awesome, high-resolution gaming
going on in your theater. Keep in mind that not too many games on the
market have been specially designed (as they must be) to really take advan-
tage of HDTV, but more and more are being so designed. And even if games
aren’t 1080i games, they still work well with (and look good on) HDTVs.
Get your HDTV gaming on with the Xbox 360
Microsoft didn’t just rest on its laurels with the Xbox; it went back to the
drawing boards and came out with an entirely new, better, and faster console
at the end of 2005: the Xbox 360.
The Xbox 360 uses a custom version of the IBM PowerPC chip, with three
cores (or independent processing units) providing a huge speed boost over
the older Intel chips in the original Xbox. The 360 also includes a much faster
graphics processing unit from ATI that can support high-definition (1080i)
video on your HDTV.
Other features of the Xbox 360 include
 512 Megabytes of RAM: Eight times the memory in the original Xbox for
faster access to gaming software. (You always get better response times
when you access your game in RAM rather than from the DVD or other
optical drive.)
 A 32-bit audio processor: This supports 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sur-
round sound.
119
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

 A wireless controller system: No need to worry about tripping over the
cords; the Xbox 360 offers wireless controllers that operate in the 2.4
GHz frequency band (the same frequencies used by Wi-Fi). Note that this
is an optional component — not all Xbox 360s include these controllers
in the package. You can “connect” up to four controllers at once using
the wireless system.
 An optional hard drive: Microsoft sells a 20GB hard drive for the Xbox
360 that can hold music, pictures, and other media.
 Network capabilities: The Xbox 360 includes an Ethernet networking
port that lets you connect your console to a home network for on-line
gaming and for media purposes (like playing video and audio files on
your PC). Microsoft also sells an 802.11 (Wi-Fi) wireless networking
adapter that lets you connect to a wireless network (802.11a or 802.11g).
When you read that the Xbox 360 has “built-in wireless” capabilities,
remember that this is for the controllers. If you want to use the wireless
networking capability to connect your Xbox 360 to a home network and
the Internet, you need this optional 802.11 networking adapter.
 Front USB ports: The Xbox 360 has two USB ports hidden under a port
on the front of the unit (and a third USB port on the back) that let you
connect devices like an iPod, a Sony PSP (handheld gaming machine), 
or even a digital camera.
 Media center capabilities: This is one of our favorite features of the
Xbox 360 — if you have a Windows XP Media Center Edition PC, you 
can use your Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender that will allow you 
to access all of the TV, music, photos, and video functionality of your
Media Center PC over your home’s wired or wireless network. So you
can have your media stored on the Media Center PC in your home office
and use the Xbox 360 to access and enjoy the media in your home the-
ater. Pretty darned cool if you ask us.
The Xbox 360 comes in two different versions: the Xbox 360 (the fancier pack-
age) and the Core Edition (which does without some of the niceties). The
fully featured Xbox 360 includes the hard drive, a wireless controller, a head-
set for Xbox Live on-line gaming with voice communications, an Ethernet
cable for networking, and a component video cable for high-definition TV
hook-ups. The Core Edition does without these features (it has a wired con-
troller, for example), but you can buy all of these accessories a la carte if and
when you decide you need them. The Xbox 360 also includes a free Xbox Live
on-line gaming subscription (the Silver package for free, and a month trial of
the Gold package) — you need to add on an accessory hard drive to the Core
Edition to get this feature. The full-featured Xbox 360 bundle lists for $399,
while the Xbox 360 Core Edition is a hundred bucks cheaper at $299.

If you want to get a lot of detail about the Xbox 360, check out Xbox 360 For
Dummies, by Brian Johnson and Duncan Mackenzie. Those guys have all the
good insider scoop and can give you levels of detail that we simply don’t
have room to include.
Unlike the soon-to-be-released PS3, the Xbox 360 does not have a built-in 
optical drive that can play high-definition movies (the PS3 has a Blu-ray disc
drive built-in). Microsoft has, however, announced an accessory HD-DVD
drive that can be plugged into the Xbox 360, enabling the 360 to be a full 
high-definition source device in your home theater.
Not Rubik’s Cube; it’s GameCube
Not to be outdone by Sony and Microsoft, the granddaddy of game consoles,
Nintendo, has its own new, high-powered, home theater–ready gaming con-
sole called the GameCube. This is by far the cutest of the three. It’s positively
tiny, especially compared with the huge hunk of metal that holds in the
innards of the Xbox. The GameCube (or GC to the gaming cognoscenti) is no
slouch, performance-wise, despite its diminutive dimensions (the GC is only 
4 inches high).
Inside of the GC is a 485 MHz PowerPC processor — just like the ones tradi-
tionally inside of Apple Macs and PowerBooks and used by the Xbox 360.
(IBM, the maker of PowerPC chips, and Nintendo have code-named this chip
“Gekko.”)
Other features of the GameCube include
 A powerful graphics processor: This one is code-named “Flipper,” like the
dolphin (though you shouldn’t get this Flipper wet). Built by ATI (a leader
in the computer graphics chip market), Flipper can crank out up to 12 mil-
lion polygons per second to fill your screen with gamey goodness.
 40MB of system memory: This includes 24MB of some superfast RAM
called MoSys 1T-SRAM. (No, we’re not sure what that name stands for
either, but it is faster than regular memory chips.)
 Four ports for gaming controllers: These are for multiplayer games.
 Two memory card slots: You can use these to save game information.
 A proprietary optical disc that’s smaller than traditional DVDs or CDs:
This smaller disc helps keep the size of the GC down to a minimum, but
it does have the unfortunate drawback of keeping the GC from doing
double duty as your home DVD player.
121
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

The GameCube lags behind the other two consoles in some ways. Namely, its
performance is slightly lower (though still excellent), and it can’t play DVDs
or CDs, which is why we mention it last. It does have some advantages
though. Its small size makes it quite portable if you want to move your GC to
the kids’ bedroom (or take it out of the kids’ bedroom!). Nintendo has a lot of
incredibly popular games (think Mario) that you can play only on the GC. And
finally, the GC costs less than the other consoles. (We haven’t talked about
prices too much yet because they change all the time and because so many
different packages are out there. But as we write this book, the basic console
and one-controller package for a PS2 or an Xbox is $199, whereas the
GameCube is only $99.)
If you or your kids have one of the handheld Nintendo Game Boy Advance
units, you can buy a cable to hook it up to your GameCube to play head-to-
head between the units or to view your Game Boy games on the big screen.
122
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 
It’s a revolution
Just as Microsoft and Sony have launched (or
will soon launch, in the case of Sony) replace-
ments for the Xbox and PS2, so will Nintendo
follow up the GC with a faster, sleeker, and more
home 
theater–friendly 
“next-generation”
gaming console.
The next Nintendo is code-named the Nintendo
Revolution. As we write, a lot of the specs are
still up in the air, but here’s what we do know.
The Revolution will be powered by a new CPU,
code-named “Broadway,” built by IBM (per-
haps part of the PowerPC family). ATI is devel-
oping a new graphics chipset, code-named
“Hollywood,” for the Revolution. (We’re waiting
for another component to be code-named
“Bollywood,” but so far no luck!)
There aren’t a lot of details about the capabili-
ties of the Revolution, but we expect that it will
be able to support 5.1- or 7.1-channel surround
sound, but that it might not support HDTV 
resolutions in its graphics display (no 720p or 
1080p) — too bad. We hope that this capability
is added in before the final specs are 
completed!
The coolest thing about the Revolution, at least
from what is known about the console so far, is
the controller. Rather than a traditional game
controller, the Revolution will have a controller
that looks a lot like a TV remote control — with
fewer buttons and a more vertical orientation,
as opposed to the horizontal orientation of most
game controllers. The neat part is that this con-
troller includes some sensors that can detect
the motion of the controller in your hand, so you
can control action on the screen (or at least
some of the actions) by simply moving the con-
troller in space, without having to push buttons
or press toggles. This is something we’ve been
waiting for someone to add into gaming, so
we’re glad to see that Nintendo is on the case.
The Revolution will also be wireless-enabled,
with built-in 802.11 Wi-Fi networking. This fea-
ture will allow you to quickly and easily get your
Revolution “on the Net” for Internet on-line
gaming. Very cool.

The currently shipping models of the GC don’t include a digital audio 
output for discrete surround sound. That means you’ll have to use your 
A/V receiver’s Dolby Pro Logic IIx capabilities to create surround sound out
of the two-channel stereo audio the GC does put out.
Playing games on-line
Playing a video game by yourself can be a lot of fun, but some games are just
meant to be played head-to-head against a human opponent. It’s really a lot
more fun to blow up your friends than it is to bomb an artificial computer
opponent. Unfortunately, your friends can’t always come over to play —
especially if, like Pat, you’ve bumped into the big “FOUR OH” and find your-
self trying to convince your friends to come over to play games. (“Uh, no, 
you can’t bring your baby.”)
Luckily, the broadband revolution that’s given so many of us high-speed
Internet access at home (using cable modems or DSL) has come to the video
game world. All three of the gaming consoles we discuss in this chapter now
have optional on-line gaming kits that enable you to connect your console
not only to the home theater, but also to the Internet.
This connection opens up a world of new opportunities in game play. Play
head to head against your buddy across town — or across the country. Join
on-line games with complete strangers. Whatever floats your boat.
If the Xbox is your game console of choice, you need to check out Xbox Live
(www.xbox.com/live). For $69.99, you get the components you need to get
on-line and a year of gaming service — additional years cost $49.99. Microsoft
doesn’t provide the broadband service for Xbox Live, just the gaming service
itself, and Xbox Live is broadband only. The gaming service eliminates the
need to subscribe to one service for Game A and another for Game B.
The Xbox 360 (the full-featured edition with the built-in hard drive) comes
with on-line gaming capabilities as well — a “Silver” level is free and lets you
join on-line gaming communities, download (or purchase) games on-line, set
up a profile for yourself, and even communicate with others via voice (using
the Xbox 360’s headset). If you want to get involved in actually playing head-
to-head against other gamers on-line, you need to upgrade to the “Gold” level.
Everyone gets a free month of Gold with their Xbox 360 — if you like it and
want to keep your Gold status, you must pay. There are several different sub-
scription levels (depending on whether you buy in a store or on-line, and for
how long) — the one year subscription purchased on-line is $49.99. Note that
the Xbox Live service for Xbox 360 is part of the same overall service offered
by Microsoft, but is designed specifically for the newer console — and that the
subscription plans and hardware are different for the two different consoles.
123
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

If you use a PS2, you need to spend $40 on Sony’s PlayStation 2 Network
Adapter, which enables you to connect via broadband or dialup connections.
We think you really need broadband to do on-line gaming right (otherwise the
play is just too choppy and lagged), but if you can’t get broadband, it’s nice
to have the option of dialup. Regardless of how you connect, with a PS2, you
need to sign up for a separate gaming service for each game you have
(through the game software companies like Sega and EA).
The Nintendo GameCube can be connected to your on-line service by using
either a standard dialup Internet connection or a broadband connection.
Nintendo sells two separate adapters, one for each type of connection, for
about $69 each. As we write, you can play only one game on-line — Phantasy
Star Online — and it requires an $8.95-per-month subscription and works with
most on-line services (but not, unfortunately, with the biggest one — AOL).
The forthcoming PS3 and Nintendo Revolution will both support on-line
gaming as well, but as we write, details about pricing or how you get your
console on-line aren’t available. As these consoles (finally!) hit the market,
you’ll be able to find out more at Sony and Nintendo’s Web sites.
Remember that the cost of getting into on-line gaming is higher than just the
price of the kit or service. You also need to account for the costs of new,
online-ready games (we expect to see a ton of new ones hit the market) and
gaming services. If you’re not using an Xbox and Xbox Live, you also need to
keep in mind that there may be costs associated with the on-line gaming ser-
vices that let you connect with others on-line — meaning you may have to
pay some additional fees to the game software companies.
Consoles aren’t just for games
A game console isn’t just fun — it can also be a multipurpose device that
does more than just games. In fact, all of the manufacturers of game consoles
have scores of engineers in white lab coats squirreled away at their head-
quarters, developing new ways that game consoles can be the centerpiece of
a home’s media room. So, although we’re about to mention a few of the things
that game consoles can do in the here and now, there’s more to come.
Let’s stay in the present for a moment, however, and look at what game con-
soles can do today:
 Play DVD movies: The Xbox, Xbox 360, and PS2 can all do this, although
neither the Xbox nor the PS2 has progressive-scan DVD functionality. (See
Chapter 6 if you’re not sure what that means.) The PS3, with its built-in
Blu-ray disc drive, will be capable of playing high-definition movies as well
as standard DVDs (as will the Xbox 360 with the accessory HD-DVD drive
that Microsoft has announced) — you’ll be able to view progressive-scan
DVDs and TrueHD (720p or 1080i) with the PS3 or Xbox 360.
124
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 Play audio CDs: Again, both the Xbox and the PS2 can play any of your
audio CDs when connected to your home theater. The Xbox 360 goes fur-
ther here by letting you integrate a USB-equipped portable music player
like an iPod into the system — simply plug it in and access your music
through the Xbox 360. And if you have a Media Center Edition PC or
Windows XP PC, your Xbox 360 can access all of the music you’ve stored
on that device.
 Surf the Web: Not for novices, but if you have a PS2, you can buy Sony’s
Linux Kit for the PS2 for about $200. Linux, in case you aren’t familiar
with it, is a UNIX-based computer operating system favored by many
techies, and this kit (which includes a hard drive, mouse, keyboard, and
network adapter) lets you run all sorts of Linux applications on the PS2.
Find out more at www.playstation.com.
This last item isn’t exactly mainstream, but it gives you a good idea of where
consoles are heading — right into the PC mainstream.
Because video game consoles tend to display parts of their images in a static
fashion — in other words, part of the picture never, or rarely, changes — you
need to be careful when picking a television for your video game–enhanced
home theater. Some projection televisions (mainly those that use CRT picture
tubes) and some flat-panel TVs (plasma screen TVs) can experience “burn in”
when you use video games on them a lot. This means that the thin phosphor
layers that light up to show your picture on these TVs become permanently
etched with the images from your video game. Check the TV manufacturer’s
instructions before you use a video game console with one of these TVs.
Integrating PC-based Gaming 
into Your Home Theater
Although most people think of console gaming as something you do in the
living room (or home theater room) and PC gaming as something you do in
the home office or at a desk somewhere, PC-based games actually do have a
role in the home theater. Speaking even more generally, we think PCs have a
place in — or connected to — your home theater for a lot of functions. (Read
Chapter 8 for more on this, if you’ve skipped it.)
Gaming on the PC has evolved over the years to be as sophisticated, fast, and
graphics-rich as console gaming. In fact, if you want the ultimate in gaming
machines — the no-holds-barred, polygon-generating king of the hill — you
need to look at a PC, not at a console. And PCs are inherently more network-
able than a console; these days, you have to try hard to find a PC that doesn’t
have a modem, an Ethernet port, and a dozen other ways to connect to other
devices and networks. So PC-based gaming can be a great alternative to the
125
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

consoles we discuss earlier in this chapter. You’re no longer limited to that
Minesweeper game that comes loaded on all PCs.
We should mention right up front in this section that purpose-built gaming
consoles make the most sense for most people in a home theater. They’re
ready to go out of the box; with Plug-and-Play, they’re simple to connect, set
up, and play. Most PCs, on the other hand, need some serious tweaking to do
gaming in a home theater environment (and by that, we mean using the sur-
round sound system and television/monitor of your home theater). So keep
that in mind.
Upgrading to Windows XP Media Center
The easiest way to get your PC involved in your home theater is to go out 
and buy an entirely new PC — one that uses Microsoft’s new Windows XP
Media Center Edition operating system. You can find out a ton about this new
evolution of Windows at Microsoft’s “test drive” site: www.microsoft.com/
windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx.
Media Center is all about the convergence of the PC and the TV (and other
home theater components). It was designed from the ground up as an operat-
ing system and a set of PC hardware that lets you easily connect the PC to
your home entertainment gear. For this reason, you can’t (at least currently)
just go out and buy a Media Center upgrade for your current PC. Instead, you
need to buy a new PC that includes some hardware specifically designed
around the new operating system and that will facilitate this new PC-to-TV
connection.
Media Center Edition PCs usually include the following extra (or enhanced)
components, compared to a regular PC:
 A graphics card (or controller) with a TV Out connection that uses com-
ponent video, S-Video, or composite video (RCA) cables to connect to
your TV or home theater receiver. (Check out Chapter 16 for more
details on what these connections are.)
 A sound board that can output surround sound using Dolby Digital 5.1.
(See Chapter 5 for details on Dolby.)
 A remote control that lets you sit on the couch and click away at your PC.
The only things you need to transform a Media Center PC into a full-fledged
member of your home theater are the cables to plug things together and, of
course, the games and controllers that you want to play with.
We talk a lot more about Media Center PCs in Chapter 8.
126
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Building your own gaming PC
You don’t need to get an XP Media Center PC to get your PC games hooked
into your home theater. Creating your own Home Theater PC is a very valid
approach — as long as you keep in mind that it might take a bit more PC
expertise than just buying a new PC that was specially designed for such use.
We talk at length in Chapter 8 about how to choose PCs and PC components
and accessories as source devices and video recorders for your home the-
ater, and exactly the same rules that apply there apply to using your PC as a
gaming machine in your home theater.
You need just a couple of things:
 A graphics card that can
• Connect to a television
• Display properly on the television (meaning it can output the right
resolution for your particular TV)
 A sound card that can connect to your home theater receiver using
either analog (RCA) jacks or a digital connection, and that can provide
the receiver with analog Dolby Pro Logic or (preferably) Dolby Digital
signals
That’s basically it. In Chapter 18, we talk more about setting up your PC and
home Internet connection with your home theater.
Adding Extra Game Controllers
Whatever game system you choose — console or PC, Xbox or PS2 (or Xbox
360 or PS3) — you need to interface with it. That is the whole point of games:
interactivity. Of course, by connecting your game system to your home the-
ater, you’ve covered how your eyes and ears (and rear end, if you’ve got a big
enough subwoofer) interface with the system. The other key interface is, of
course, your hands (and sometimes feet), which connect to your games with
a controller.
All game consoles come with one or two basic multipurpose controllers that
usually have enough buttons and joysticks and four-way pointers to drive us
adults crazy (though the kids seem to catch on to them right away). These
controllers (sometimes called gamepads) allow you to play just about any
game if you can twist your thumbs in the right direction and have the appro-
priate level of dexterity and coordination. You might, however, want to con-
sider some specialized controllers if you have certain games that you simply
127
Chapter 9: Gaming Galore

love to play again and again. (You might save yourself from repetitive stress
injuries this way — and increase your score!)
Some of the controllers you can buy include
 Wireless controllers: These are usually just like the general-purpose
controllers, but they connect by using radio waves, not wires. If you
have dogs, small kids, or are simply sick of tripping over wires, pick up 
a pair of these wireless wonders.
 Wheel controllers: The kids like Mario, but we like Grand Turismo 3
(at least Pat does). In other words, we want to pretend that we’re not
stuck in traffic, that we’re Colin McRae zipping through the World Rally
Championship in our WRX. Thumb buttons don’t cut it for this activity.
Get a wheel controller that includes brake and accelerator pedals, a big
fat racing wheel, and a nice short-throw shift knob. Racers, start your
engines! Check out www.madcatz.com for our favorite wheels.
 Joysticks: Want to pretend you’re “Cool Hand” Grafton’s wing man in
Flight of the Intruder? Well, then you need a joystick controller with
enough buttons to “pickle” your bombs on target. Check out www.
thrustmaster.com for some cool joysticks.
There are literally a ton of controllers out there you can buy (really, we bought
one of each and weighed them! — okay, that’s a lie), including some really
funky ones. There are skateboard-shaped controllers that you stand on for
skating, surfing, or boarding games, and even one that consists of a mat for
replicating dance moves you see on-screen. You can find something for every-
one, and groovy controllers are truly a way to maximize your home theater fun.

Accessing Digital Content at
Home and Over the Internet
In This Chapter
 Learning about Internet-based audio and video content
 Understanding home broadband network requirements
 Finding content around the house
 Using a Media Center PC to display content
 Using a media adapter to display content
U
ntil recently, most of the content destined for your home theater came
in the form of DVDs, camcorder tapes, VHS videos, burned MP3s, CDs,
audio tapes, and other such content in and around the home. Not much of it
came directly and in real time from Internet sources (except to those of you
who figured out Napster before it got shut down!).
Believe it or not, soon, very soon, the Internet is going to be the main way you
get content into your home theater. Believe us — we do this for a living. You
are just seeing the earliest movements toward the flood of Internet content —
buying music and TV shows from Apple’s iTunes, searching for home videos 
at http://video.google.com, accessing streaming video of your local high
school basketball team being filmed live by students . . . it’s going to come from
everywhere, and the vast majority of it is going to come from the Internet.
High-speed Internet connectivity — which again we argue is a baseline
requirement for any home theater — will enable you to download a lot of con-
tent for viewing whenever you would like. This will put lots of pricing and
product pressure on the cable, satellite, and telephone company TV offer-
ings, and that does not bother us a bit!
A large number of diverse players are trying to make Internet-based content
as easy for you to adopt as finding a sports score or weather forecast on any
portal site. Yahoo!, MSN, Google, and others will be trying to convince you to
search, view, and even buy content through their portals.

Having an Internet-based home theater is Step One. After you are plugged in,
the World Wide Web is open to you. This means you’ll have digital content
around your house from all over the world to keep you busy at night! Whew,
and you thought you were going to get some sleep!
Learning about Digital Content 
for Your Home Theater
Grabbing music and video off the Internet is likely not a new topic for you.
Companies like Napster and KaZaA have been in the news for years, and on-
line music and video stores like Apple’s iTunes are an often-mentioned item
in almost any magazine or newspaper.
But when you get right down to it, a few high-level constructs would be good
to introduce, so you know what all the fuss is about.
Whether it’s on a computer hard drive down the hall or on a server in Outer
Mongolia, the concepts surrounding “content” are the same.
So here’s a quick hit of the key concepts we want you to know about elec-
tronic content:
 File Encoding: Digital music and video files are encoded (converted to
digital formats) using specific encoding formats. For audio, MP3 is most
common, but there are many others out there, including Windows Media
Audio (WMA), Advanced Audio Code (AAC), and even weirdly named
ones like Ogg Vorbis. We discuss these audio formats in detail in Chap-
ter 3. Similarly, there are a number of video formats (like WMV and
MPEG), discussed in Chapter 4.
The key thing you must keep in mind about the encoding format used
for your audio or video is that whatever system you use for decoding
that file to display it on your home theater must support the format you
are using. For example, if your digital media adapter doesn’t support
Apple’s encrypted AAC format, you won’t be able to play music from 
the iTunes Music Store on your home theater system.
 Streaming versus downloading: Not all audio or video is delivered 
in the same fashion. In fact, there are two predominant ways of sending 
the content — streaming and downloading. Streaming video means that
there is no local copy of the video on your device. It plays while it is
delivered over your home network and/or the Internet. Most Internet
connections aren’t fast enough to play really high quality streaming
video, so you find that many Internet movies are downloaded to your
machine instead. Downloaded video is delivered as a file to be stored
inside your set-top box, Media Center PC, or other device, and then
130
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

played back from that local storage. So while downloaded video can
deliver a TV-like quality viewing experience, complete with the ability 
to fast forward, pause, rewind, and so on, you have to wait a while —
usually up to an hour or more — for full-length movies to download.
 Internet radio: Internet radio is exactly what it sounds like — radio sta-
tions broadcasting in a streaming fashion over the Internet. So if you are
a college student and you miss your favorite radio station back home,
you can still listen to it via streaming audio over the Internet.
We discuss Internet radio briefly in Chapter 5 in addition to later in this
chapter.
 Podcasts: Podcasts are the equivalent of downloaded Internet radio. They
are files that contain audio (and, more and more, video) that often are
packaged like daily newscasts or commentary. Podcasts are so named
because they initially were targeted toward easy dissemination of content
to iPod users.
 Video search: Video search is catching on fast. Video search engines scour
the Web and find content based on keywords and file formats and then
make this available through some sort of on-screen interface. Google has
perhaps the best-known search interface at http://video.google.
com, but there are others, including Yahoo! (http://video.search.
yahoo.com) and AltaVista (www.altavista.com/video/default).
These search engines marry the best of non-X-rated amateur videos from
the Web with the ability to buy videos of TV show series and movies as
well.
 File sharing: File-sharing networks are networks set up for, not surpris-
ingly, sharing files. In a very “free love” approach to content, early file-
sharing networks adopted a “What’s mine is yours, and vice versa”
approach toward exchanging content. Basically, you were encouraged 
to make your music available to anyone who wanted it, and they would
do the same with you. Napster, Grokster, and other early leaders in this
space were taken to court by the music industry, proven to be in viola-
tion of Federal copyright laws in the United States, and shut down. Most
of the large worldwide music-sharing services used peer-to-peer tech-
nologies, described below.
 Peer-to-peer: Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a concept often associated with music
file sharing because it is the way most of the illegal music download ser-
vices worked. Peer-to-peer simply means that you directly connect to
other people’s computers to download files, instead of going to a central
file server. See, not only are central file servers expensive and require a
lot of costly broadband bandwidth to support music and video down-
loading, they’re also very easy to find and shut down.
Peer-to-peer networks operate without such central control, and allow
multiple users to share files at the same time — you’ll often be down-
loading and uploading different “chunks” of a file to and from numerous
folks at the same time.
131
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

Peer-to-peer is not just used for file sharing — you also probably use it
for some instant messaging services, too.
 Digital rights management (DRM): No initials in your Home Theater
Glossary (you keep it under your pillow, don’t you?) are more accursed
than DRM — digital rights management. If you download a lot of iTunes
songs, you’ve run into DRM restrictions when trying to load your songs
to other devices. (Most portable music players — besides the iPod —
simply can’t play back iTunes Music Store downloads.) If you’ve ever
tried to copy a DVD, you’ve encountered DRM. DRM is everywhere you
don’t want it to be.
To be fair, DRM exists for a reason — to protect the copyright interests of
the music, movie, and other content owners. Managing who has rights to
do what with which digital assets is a key function of any DRM system.
DRM is often in the news, but you may not hear it referenced as such. In
late 2005/early 2006, when you saw all the hubbub over Sony putting
DRM software on their CDs to protect against unauthorized copying —
software that was resident in a PC’s rootkit — that was a DRM issue.
(Though the issue itself wasn’t the activity of the DRM system, but rather
the “secret” software that the CD installed onto people’s hard drives.)
The rules for sharing content are defined both technically and legally.
You can do a lot of stuff technically — that does not make it legal. You
can safely assume that the law says you can’t copy anything unless you
are told you explicitly can. You also can pretty much assume you cannot
rebroadcast or retransmit the content in any way. Indeed, some analysts
question whether the Slingbox, mentioned later in this chapter (it’s a
device that sends your home theater TV signals across the Internet to
your laptop or mobile phone), violates copyright rules by retransmitting
the signals received by your set-top box. By the time you read this, this
may have (or not) become a mainstream issue.
But we did say that part of sharing content is defined technically. This 
is true. In many instances, you cannot record or copy content because
there is special coding in the content itself that prevents you from doing
this.
Some of the music services will explicitly allow you to make one copy, or
play the songs on up to five machines, or some such limitation. This will
be part of your subscription contract and should be fairly obvious. For
instance, if you download content from iTunes, you can house that con-
tent on up to five computers (and an unlimited number of iPods). Look
for this when trying to decide which service to use.
We specifically talk about DRM issues throughout this book as we
encounter DRM problems. For the sake of this chapter, know that the
Internet content you download will have strong limits on where you can
put it, and you will most likely be able to view/listen to the content only
on the machine to which you download the content.
132
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Gauging Your Network Requirements
Figuring out digital content’s impact on your computing and network require-
ments is a lot like trying to figure out how much space you need in your living
room for books. There are big books, small books, fat books, thin books.
Depending on the size of what you like, that’s what you need to plan for.
With music, videos, and even pictures, it is a little more predictable than
book sizes because
 You can usually decide the quality of the content recording you are
obtaining/making.
 You can determine how long you want to have the content.
 You can determine when you want to have it.
It goes without saying that if you want to download the biggest movie at the
best quality and you want to keep it stored on your hard drive (you just love
that Rome mini-series don’t ya!) and you want it now, then you’re going to
need a lot more capacity than someone who merely wants to stream a movie
to their small TV set in average-quality mode and be done with it.
Figuring out the basics
You’ll hear companies talk about the number of songs or movies you can
store on their MP3 players and other digital content media. To make these
statements, the manufacturers have to make an assumption about your
encoding format, and they will generally assume a lower-quality format to
boost the number of songs they can brag can fit on their devices!
 For music, 384 Kbps encoding is very high quality to most people, and
that implies that you can fit about 6,600 songs onto an 80GB hard drive.
 Many folks encode their songs at lower bit rates, like 192 Kbps or even
128 Kbps, allowing even more songs to fit on the drive. You’ll have to
make your own judgment about quality versus space. We think 384 Kbps
is a good balance between audio quality and storage space; you may be
happier with a higher or lower bit rate.
 For video, near-DVD quality is about 1.5 Mbps bit rate and about 4 Mbps 
is a good rule of thumb for full DVD quality. At these bit rates, you can fit
about 50 or so “near-DVD” quality movies on an 80GB hard drive, or about
18 “full DVD” quality movies on the same sized drive.
 For photos, a high-resolution photo is about 2.5MB, and you can fit about
30,000 pictures onto an 80GB hard drive.

Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

 If you’re going to be streaming a lot of content from the Internet, then
the minimum bandwidth we think you want to have from your broad-
band access service is a 2 Mbps download speed — though you can 
get by with less.
Broadband access into your home is typically asymmetrical, meaning that
your download speeds are different — and almost always higher — than your
upload speeds. The nature of the Internet has been that you ask for some-
thing, be it a Web page or anything else, and you get it. The size of your 
question uploaded to the Internet (a few bytes worth of “Show me http://
www.dummies.com”) and the size of the file that is downloaded in response
(all the files that constitute the whole Web page) are drastically different, and
the broadband network technologies were skewed toward larger download
speeds for this reason.
Checking your in-home capabilities
In addition to the capabilities of your PC and of your Internet connection, 
you need to concern yourself with the capabilities of your in-home network
connections — the wired or wireless networks that carry content between
your broadband modem, your computers, and your home theater and net-
worked source devices in the home theater.
The size of the network within your home is not as asymmetrical, and files are
flying all over the place between computers, your modems, printers, scan-
ners, cameras, and so on. So your home’s computer network is considered
symmetrical and is designed out of the box as such. Thus, you see home net-
working measured in terms of overall bidirectional capacity at any one time,
such as 10 Mbps.
We discuss home networking for your home theater in detail in Chapter 18.
Making Your Content Digital
While you can obtain a lot of cool digital content for your home theater from
the Internet and on-line services and stores, you’ll probably find that a good
deal of things you’d like to display in your home theater comes from sources
inside of your home. You probably already have collections of movies, songs,
and photographs that are not digital, but which you’d like to display in your
theater. There’s nothing wrong with just using analog source devices (like
VCRs, cassette decks, and turntables) to get this content into your home the-
ater, but many folks like to go “all digital.”
Why is this the case? Well, first of all, digital media is typically much more
durable than analog media. LP records scratch, tapes break and wear out, but
134
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

digital files can be played over and over without any degradation. Second,
digital media is physically very space efficient — you can cram a lot of video,
music, and photos onto a small computer hard drive and then put the bulky
tapes, records, and cassettes away in the attic. Finally, digital media is more
convenient — instead of pulling out a tape (for example), you can simply
“browse” for that video on a computer interface and instantly start playing 
it (and pause, rewind, and skip around much more easily too!).
If your content is not yet digitized — for instance, it’s still on VHS tapes,
paper photographs, photo negatives, cassette tapes, and so on — you can
digitize it.
There’s an art and a process to getting your content digitized and putting it
on your network — much more than we can cover in this one book. But in a
nutshell, here are some options for you to consider:
 Photos: Although you can use any scanner to scan your photos into an
electronic file, we recommend that you use a scanner designed specifi-
cally to scan old photos and negatives. Most of the experts we know in
this area point to Nikon’s “CoolScan” family of slide and film scanners
(http://nikonimaging.com/global/products/scanner/index.
htm, $500–$2,000). You feed your negatives and slides into the scanner,
and the system converts them into digital files. You will have to spend
time reviewing the output, but with Nikon’s raved-about software, the
fixes made for dust and scratches are amazing. You can get cheaper
scanners, but you get what you pay for. We advise you to spend the
money and get the best you can get — there’s a reason you are scanning
all these pictures to begin with, so do it right.
 Movies: If you have shelves of VHS home movies you need to convert to
DVD, this is actually a pretty straightforward and simple process. Unless
you want to pay a lot of money for an all-in-one conversion device, you
can get by with a PC, a VCR, a device that converts the VCR’s analog sig-
nals into digital, and some editing software to make sure everything is
just right. Pinnacle Systems (www.pinnaclesys.com, $50–$130) offers
an easy-to-use line of products designed just for transferring tapes. Its
top-of-the-line Digital Video Creator 150 ($130) comes with the hardware
and software to do the conversion. (The cable has RCA jacks on one end
for connecting to your VCR and a USB 2.0 jack on other for connecting to
your PC.) If you don’t have a DVD burner in your home theater, you can
get an add-on burner that will connect to your PC starting around $75 at
any PC store.
Mac users might consider El Gato’s EyeTV system, which does most of
the same things that Digital Video Creator 150 does, only on the Apple
Mac OS. Check it out at www.elgato.com.
 Music: If you have shoeboxes full of old cassettes and peach crates full of
vinyl LPs, these too can be converted to digital. You don’t really need any
special hardware — just your old turntable or tape player. Grab a cable
135
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

with two RCA plugs at one end and a mini 1⁄8-inch stereo plug at the other,
which you can get at RadioShack. Connect the RCA plugs to the Tape Out
jacks on your preamplifier or receiver and connect the other end to the
Line In jack on your PC sound card. Then you load equalization/sound
processing software, such as Nero 7 Ultra Edition (www.nero.com, $80),
turn on your source player, and the software will clean up your vinyl and
cassette recordings, lifting out any annoying scratches and pops along
the way. If you want, it will break the long taped recording into smaller
music files so you can have each song isolated on the CD. When it’s
ready, it will help you burn the results to CD. If you have a LightScribe
burner, it will even help you label the CD. (See the “Burning labels onto
your discs in your PC!” sidebar.)
If your content is already digital — on mini-DV tapes in a FireWire-accessible
camcorder, in a Wi-Fi outfitted digital camera, on secure digital (SD) storage
cards from your cellphone camera, digital camera, or video camera, or some-
thing similar — getting it into your home theater merely involves a simple file
transfer.
If you don’t have an SD (or other digital card) reader in your home theater, get
a “universal” or “all-in-one” card reader device that can access a wide range of
memory cards and process them into your home theater gear. Transferring
files directly off your digital devices really eats into the battery charge, which
in turn, over time, reduces the life of the battery unnecessarily. Just pop out
the card and stick it in these readers, and your files automatically transfer to
the reader’s parent device. If you get devices with a USB connection, make
sure it supports the faster USB 2.0 version. Dazzle’s Universal 10-in-1 Memory
Card Reader/Writer (available from www.radioshack.com, $40) is a great
example: It reads the ten most popular memory cards from one device. That
should cover all your memory card–outfitted digital devices in your home.
136
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 
Burning labels onto your discs in your PC!
You might encounter a really cool new technol-
ogy when shopping for a CD or DVD burner.
LightScribe Direct Disc Labeling enables you to
burn professional, silkscreen-quality labels
directly on your CDs and DVDs — if you have 
a LightScribe-enabled optical disc drive and
LightScribe-compatible media. With LightScribe,
you create or download the label of your choice.
Then, after you burn your data, music, or video
onto a CD or DVD, simply flip the disc over, put it
back into the drive, and burn your newly created
label design directly onto the disc. It looks pro-
fessional and way cool. Look for LightScribe
when buying a burner.
You can save a few bucks (and get results
almost as good as LightScribe) by combining
“printable” CDs and DVDs (look on the label
when you buy) with a printer like Epson’s 
R340 — this combination lets you pop the disc
right into a slot on the printer to create high-
quality labels using the inkjet printer.

When it comes to getting camcorder movies into your home theater, check
out Microsoft’s Movie Maker software, which resides on most Windows XP
PCs. (If by chance your PC lacks a copy, you can download it for free from the
Microsoft site at www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/
default.mspx.) This will help you get your movie onto your PC, where you
can add music, move scenes around, and add on-screen text. A bit too techie
for you? Then consider Muvee’s autoProducer software (www.muvee.com,
$75). With autoProducer, you select your video file, plus the music you like
and style of movie you want to create, and press a button — autoProducer
will create the movie for you. It selects the scenes with the most apparent
action and best shots and dubs in the music, resulting in a more concise view
of your hours of home film footage. Your neighbors and friends will thank
you. If you’ve got a Mac running OS X, you can use Apple’s iMovie software. It
comes standard on most new Macs, or you can buy it as part of the Apple
iLife software bundle (www.apple.com/ilife). It’s considered by many to
be the easiest-to-use movie-making software system, but this ease-of-use
doesn’t come at the expense of capabilities. (It’s got all of the features most
nonprofessional movie makers need, and works well with Apple’s iDVD soft-
ware to create DVD movies you can bring with you.)
Finding Sources of Content On-line
Finding on-line digital content can be hard if you don’t know where to look.
More than 2,500 radio stations broadcast over the Internet, for instance. Most
mainstream FM stations also simulcast over the Internet. On the video side,
CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo!, and others offer up lots of Internet video content;
Google’s video search capability gives surfers access to amateur video as
well as Hollywood fare. Content is simply all over the place.
Lucky for you, lots of industry players have stepped up to the challenge of
organizing all of this content for you through content portals.
When it comes to buying or accessing on-line content, there are three main
forms of content services:
 Download: You download a file and it’s yours to use forever. Music down-
loads tend to fall into this category. Downloads may be free or paid for.
 Rental: You download a file, and it’s yours to use for a limited time.
Many movie rentals allow you a certain number of days to view the
movie before it expires and is no longer viewable. Rentals are usually
paid for, but can be free on promotion.
 Subscription: You subscribe to a service that gives you access to unlim-
ited use of the content as it is presented on the portal, such as subscrib-
ing to 120 channels of streaming audio for a monthly fee.
137
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

In this section, we’ll look at a few of these portals offering downloads, rentals,
and subscriptions for audio and video content.
Audio content
Audio preceded video in terms of portals on the Internet, largely because
audio could be listened to via dialup Internet connections because of the
much smaller file sizes relative to video. Video had to wait for mass broad-
band deployment to really take off.
Some of the most popular on-line audio content providers (with Web addresses
conveniently appended) are shown below:
 Apple’s iTunes Music Store (www.apple.com/itunes)
 Yahoo! Music (music.yahoo.com)
 Rhapsody (www.rhapsody.com)
 eMusic (www.emusic.com)
 Napster (www.napster.com)
The pricing and options for the services listed above change rapidly, and
we’d be doing both you and us a disservice if we tried to describe all these
services in detail. Instead, we’ll give you advice about how to find the best
service to match your needs:
 Number of songs: The bigger services offer you more choices — simple
as that. If you are very much concerned about the variety and depth of
content, then you should be aware that there is a big variance in the
number of songs — and the number of songs from high-profile artists —
each service makes available. Apple claims more than 2 million songs;
Rhapsody has more than 1 million; MusicMatch more than 900,000. Urge,
which was announced as we write this, says it has 2 million songs ready,
too. In general, the wider your tastes, the more you want to go with the
larger services.
 Flexibility in use: If you want to own all your own tracks and movies
and have no problem limiting your player choice to iPod models, then
iTunes is a great option for you. It’s simple, has an extensive catalog, is
leading the pack with video purchase options, and allows things like
sharing over your LAN and on multiple PCs. However, the downside of
iTunes is that you are married for life to the proprietary Apple world,
and that world, as of the time of this writing, is very closed. You simply
can’t play your iTunes-purchased music or video on alternate players,
set-top boxes, and so on — only Apple’s own Airport Express will play
iTunes Music Store–purchased songs remotely. On the other hand, if you
138
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

go with the more widely accessible Microsoft Windows Media Audio
(WMA)–based systems, you open up your entire home to a range of play-
ers, set-top boxes, and other platforms to access your digital content.
The most flexible, for music at least, is eMusic, which does not use any
sort of DRM (Digital Rights Management, discussed earlier in the chap-
ter) system, so you can use them on anything that plays the MP3 format.
But eMusic does not have as complete a catalog as iTunes or other ser-
vices. So there are trade-offs.
 Quality desired: There is a range of quality in the digital content as well,
mostly based on the encoding sampling rate used. None of the on-line
digital content services store content in a lossless fashion, so all of them
end up compromising the original recordings to some extent. You can
truly notice a difference between tracks encoded at 128 Kbps, 160 Kbps,
and 192 Kbps, for instance. (The higher the number, the better the qual-
ity, for those keeping track.) You do trade off the amount of music you
can store on your player, though, because the file sizes are larger for
higher sampling rates. But we think going for the higher sampling rate —
192 Kbps — is the appropriate trade-off.
 Try before you buy: If you are the type who likes to try out lots of new
bands and watch all the new indie movies, then you should look at sub-
scription services because you can listen and watch to your heart’s con-
tent and buy what you like. If you go the download route, you’ll buy a lot
of content you end up not liking — and that’s simply a waste of money.
(You could buy more of our books with all that wasted money.) Of the
subscription services, we like Rhapsody the most because of its user
interface.
 “On the go” services: If you are constantly downloading your content
and then hitting the road, you need to look at the available “To Go” ser-
vices, such as Napster To Go and Rhapsody To Go, which take their sub-
scription services and package them for road warriors. For about the
cost of a CD each month, you can grab your music player, download any-
thing in their full catalog, and hit the road. That’s well worth it in our
book. Only specific music and video players are supported, so check
their sites.
We’re not so sure you can make much of a decision based on sheer numbers —
if you care about certain types of music or specific artists, then we suggest you
avail yourself of the free trials and check them out. It’s the best way to get a
comfort level with the services.
Some services limit access to downloaded content to a specific number of
computers, often called authorized computers. Be sure to understand where
you can play your downloaded content because there usually are lots of
restrictions.
139
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

If you like audio books, check out www.audible.com for audio content you
can download to your portable music player to hear your latest book on
tape. Also, if you like Internet radio, be sure to check out the following
Internet radio hosting or search sites for cool stations:
 SHOUTcast: www.shoutcast.com
 Live365: www.live365.com
 Radio-Locator: www.radio-locator.com
Pat’s favorite Internet-only radio station is Radio Paradise (www.
radioparadise.com). You should check it out!
Video content
Many of the audio portals and services are getting into the movie act as well.
Danny downloaded the first eight episodes of the second season of Lost from
iTunes to catch up with what he’d missed on air. Some of the most popular
on-line video sources (again, with handy Web addresses appended) are listed
below:
 Movielink (www.movielink.com)
 CinemaNow (www.cinemanow.com)
 Vongo (www.vongo.com)
 Apple iTunes Music Store (www.apple.com/itunes) — yes, they have
video, too!
The video search engines we discussed earlier in the chapter (like Google’s
and Yahoo!’s) can also be great sources of downloadable or streaming video
content.
Video services change quickly as well. When looking at video services, you
come up against some of the same issues you see with audio services:
 Content: Not all video services have the same content. As we write,
iTunes has some TV shows and movie videos. CinemaNow and
MovieLink focus on Hollywood movie fare. Over time, all of these play-
ers will move toward offering the same lineup of video content, with
probably some exclusive showings here and there. But if you really want
to catch up on old TV shows (Danny really wants to watch the Rome
series he missed), then look specifically for such offers.
 Subscriptions versus downloads: For the most part, Internet-based
video is offered as pay-as-you-go downloads. But some services, such as
140
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

Akimbo (see the “Standalone media devices” section, later in this chap-
ter), have subscription-based services for certain types of content. So if
you like to watch old History Channel episodes, you might be better off
getting an Akimbo device.
 Terms of use: Some video download services let you watch a show
once. Some let you start and stop it as often as you want, but you have
to finish within three days. Some let you keep it forever. The models are
all over the place. Be sure to check out what you are buying. The price
might be the same, but the terms could be very different.
Video content is a developing market, and lots of the involved players are
trying to figure it out. Video is starting to take up more and more traffic 
on the networks, and at some point, there will be internal pressures on the
cable and telephone companies to put limits on their unlimited broadband
Internet access subscribers — in other words, they’ll probably figure out a
way to charge more to those users downloading a lot of content from the
Internet. Watch for any announcements along these lines if you are a big
video downloader.
Using an MCE PC to Access Content
In Chapter 8, we discuss home theater PCs (HTPCs) and Microsoft’s XP Media
Center Edition (MCE) software for your home theater. In this section, we dis-
cuss how you might use such a PC as a source device in your home theater —
specifically, how you’d use it to access Internet content.
HTPCs are good as an alternative to other home theater source devices — for
example, as a high-quality way to play back DVDs. But for most folks, they’re
not worth the trouble just for that purpose. What really makes an HTPC useful
is its ability to provide a portal to all sorts of great Internet-based content. Now,
if you’re a real PC aficionado, you might build an HTPC just for fun. But if you’re
like us, you’re going to go down this road only if there’s something in it for you.
There is!
Most HTPCs and Microsoft’s MCE systems enable users to seek out and find
all digital content within the home’s network. So it will scan all attached com-
puters for songs, videos, photos, and other content and then make it avail-
able to you in a consolidated portal interface, where you can view photo
slideshows, home movies, or just play music from your library.
Microsoft’s Media Center Edition software has a special section for accessing
Internet content — Online Spotlight (www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/
mediacenter/evaluation/onlinespotlight.mspx). This is an area
designed to display products and services from Microsoft’s content partners.
141
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

Some of the partners are ones mentioned earlier in the chapter — CinemaNow,
MovieLink, and Napster, to name a few — and others are just more products to
help with digital content, like Ofoto’s photosharing service or ABC’s Enhanced
TV for interactive entertainment from that network. Selecting any Spotlight
partner is as simple as clicking their icon in MCE and working within their 
MCE-compatible portal.
While it doesn’t specifically include an Online Spotlight equivalent, Apple’s
Front Row software (included on most new Macs including the iMac, the 
Mac Mini, and the latest PowerBooks) will let Mac users gain access to down-
loaded Internet content in their home theater. And El Gato’s EyeHome 
software/hardware combo (discussed in Chapter 8) provides full access to 
a Web browser on your home theater’s display, meaning you can access 
just about any Internet content through a networked Mac.
For more details on HTPCs, check out Chapter 8.
Using a Media Server or Adapter to
Access Content On-line
You don’t have to own a home theater PC to access Internet content — some
companies make it really easy for you to download Internet content to your
TV via a special unit that you connect to your TV set.
There are two main types of devices on the market:
 Media adapters/servers: Media adapters communicate with a PC and
facilitate the flow of content from and through your Internet-connected
PC to your home theater.
 Standalone devices: Standalone devices connect directly to the Internet
and do not require an intermediary PC. While they usually can catalogue
and access PC-stored content, it’s not the main focus of these devices —
so you don’t need an actively running PC to gain access to Internet con-
tent with these devices.
Media adapters and servers
Many leading consumer electronics manufacturers offer media adapters, and
capabilities and quality can vary substantially among these products. Media
adapters “adapt” the PC content to the home theater environment, offering
up content to common stereo interfaces such as RCA and digital audio jacks,
instead of the more computer-oriented USB and Ethernet jacks.
142
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

The typical media adapter is wireless, supports 802.11a or b/g, has RCA inter-
faces and a remote control, and has some sort of on-screen or LCD interface
for selecting among the content choices on your linked PC.
The list of media adapter players is long. The following list gives you a flavor
for what’s out there:
 Roku Labs SoundBridge: Roku Labs (www.rokulabs.com, $150–$400)
makes some of the sexiest products on the market. Their SoundBridge
series elegantly links your home theater to a remote PC via 802.11g 
wireless. It supports Apple’s Bonjour technology (formerly known as
Rendezvous) and iTunes, as well as Windows Media Connect, Windows
Media Player 10, and Windows Media DRM 10 — it’s the most compati-
ble music player around.
Remember, Apple does not allow streaming of its purchased music yet
(except through their own Airport Express device), so any songs bought
in iTunes cannot be played through the SoundBridge, but it does sup-
port the AAC format so that when Apple does open this up, Roku will
support it — the SoundBridge does support any music that you’ve
imported (ripped) into iTunes on your own.
 Squeezebox: Mama’s got a Squeezebox, and it’s made by Slim Devices
(www.slimdevices.com, $249). It has standard analog as well as digital
optical and coax outputs, so you can link this into your stereo directly
with high-quality inputs if you like. The Squeezebox has “always-on”
Internet Radio, powered by its own SqueezeNetwork, that lets you tune
in to Internet radio streams even when the home PC is switched off. It
features Ethernet and 802.11g connections. (The wireless-capable ver-
sion costs a bit more, listing at $299.) Overall, very nice.
 Apple AirPort Express: Aside from being the only device we know of that
can stream Apple songs purchased in the iTunes Music Store (because it’s
made by Apple, of course), the AirPort Express (www.apple.com, $129) is
a small, funky little device that serves multiple roles: media adapter, travel
router, print server, Wi-Fi repeater, and more. You don’t get a remote con-
trol, LCD, or on-screen display. For that, you’ll want to upgrade to a Mac
Mini running its Front Row software. We expect that by the time you read
this, Apple will have launched its full digital media hub with Front Row
and DVR functionality on board. We can’t wait for that, personally. Be sure
to look on Apple’s Web site (www.apple.com) for that media adapter/
set-top box.
 Other media adapters: Media adapters are all over the place and
include
• D-Link’s MediaLounge products (www.dlink.com, $150–$250),
including the DSM-520 Wireless HD Media Player and the DSM-120
Wireless Music Player
143
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

• Netgear’s Wireless Digital Media Players (www.netgear.com,
$80–$150), including the MP115 and MP101
• Linksys’s wireless entertainment products (www.linksys.com,
$75–$85), including the WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridge and the
WMCE54AG Dual-Band Wireless A/G Media Center Extender
• Actiontec’s Wireless Digital Media Player (www.actiontec.com,
$130)
Standalone media devices
Whereas media adapters were first out of the gate with lots of units, stand-
alone media devices are growing rapidly. Here’s a sampling of what’s on the
market:
 Akimbo (www.akimbo.com, $70): Akimbo offers an Internet content
delivery service of TV shows, movies, and other video content. Akimbo
can be accessed with an Akimbo set-top box or a Windows XP Media
Center Edition PC via Online Spotlight. Akimbo offers a wide range of
content, from the History Channel to Naked News. Akimbo offers two
service levels:
• Basic: For $9.99 per month, you can watch and download unlimited
views of the basic content in Akimbo. Basic content includes fare
such as a Turner Classic Movie of the Week, rock music videos
from PlayMusic, and lots of National Geographic episodes, as well
as trial subscriptions to paid content.
• Premium: For an extra fee, typically $0.99–$3.99, you can watch
other content on demand, just like cable video on demand if you
have ever bought a movie on cable. BBC episodes of Little Women
run $0.99, and movies from MovieLink can run about $3.99 or more.
Some content has no viewing limit, and some has a 30-day allowable
viewing period. Akimbo is adding content partners each month, and
expects to have one of the largest collections of on-demand downloads
in the industry.
 TiVo (www.tivo.com, starts around $50): While TiVo is definitely
known for its personal video recording functionality, it is moving well
beyond that space with deals with Yahoo!, Live365, Netflix, and others
that in aggregate will open up the TiVo box to the whole Internet. Under
the Netflix deal, for instance, you would not have to wait a day to get
your disc — it would be downloaded in an hour to your unit. With your
Live365 subscription, you can access thousands of radio stations on
Live365’s network through your home theater setup without even need-
ing a PC.
144
Part II: What Are You Going to Watch?: Source Devices 

 Acoustic Energy’s Wi-Fi Internet Radio (www.acoustic-
energy.co.uk, $350): The AE Wi-Fi Internet Radio is compatible with
all three major streaming formats — Real Audio, MP3, and Windows
Media streams — making it compatible with nearly all the world’s broad-
casters. It also supports 802.11b and 802.11g Wi-Fi connectivity, which
frees you from having to be near a broadband connection.
 LUKAS MP3 Internet Radio (www.stream-it.nl, $250): The Lukas
MP3 Internet Radio allows you to listen to thousands of free and sub-
scription Internet radio stations without having to use a computer. This
simple device allows you to change channels between stations you
select when you set up the radio. A single loudspeaker outputs the
sound — you can also plug the Internet Radio into a receiver and exter-
nal speakers using its analog audio outputs (RCA jacks). Volume

Taking Your Video with You
Getting Internet and computer-based content into your home theater is a neat
trick (and one that we highly recommend you explore). But what’s even neater
is being able to access your home theater content away from your home the-
ater. Imagine watching a show that you’ve recorded on your DVR and having
to hop on the train to work before it’s over. Well, with the right hardware and
software, you can take that content with you and watch it on a laptop or hand-
held device wherever you are (as long as you have Internet connectivity).
This is a new area in home theater, and one that still has some bugs to work
out, both technical and legal — digital rights management (DRM) raises its
ugly head again! But it’s something that you can do today, and that will
become even more common in the future. In the following section, we tell you
about the first few fruits of this new category of home entertainment gear:
 TiVoToGo: If you have a Series 2 TiVo DVR, you can use the TiVoToGo
software built into the product to take your recorded shows on the road
with you. This isn’t an Internet-based product (like the Slingbox, which
we discuss next). Instead, it uses your home network to transfer record-
ings from your TiVo to a Windows 2000 or XP laptop, or to a Windows
Mobile handheld device before you leave home. When the transfer is
done, you can use TiVo’s software (a free download from TiVo’s Web
145
Chapter 10: Accessing Digital Content at Home and Over the Internet

site) on that device to watch your recorded programs whenever and
wherever you like. Check out www.tivo.com for more info.
 Slingbox: The Slingbox ($249 list price) is perhaps the coolest thing to
come along the home theater and Internet pike in many years. It’s a
funky-looking box that you connect to your home theater and to your
home network/Internet connection. Slingbox hooks into your TV source
devices (like a cable or satellite set-top box, a DVD player, or a DVR) and
allows you to remotely control, record, and watch video content. You can
use a Slingbox to tune into live TV (for example, catch the local baseball
game while you’re on the road in your broadband-equipped hotel room)
or to access recorded content on your DVR or DVD player. The compan-
ion to Slingbox is SlingPlayer software, which resides on a Windows 2000
or XP computer, and which controls the Slingbox and let’s you view con-
tent across an Internet connection. SlingPlayer optimizes the content
you’re viewing to the speed of your connection, so if you’re on a broad-
band connection, you can get a high-quality picture. SlingPlayer Mobile
is also becoming available (from Sling’s Web site for $29.99), and it will
allow this capability to work on any Windows Mobile device as well.
Check it out at www.slingbox.com).
• Sony LocationFree: Sony’s $349 answer to the Slingbox, the
LocationFree player, performs similar tasks, sending live TV and
content from various DVRs across an Internet connection to
remote PCs. Like the Slingbox, LocationFree let’s you access your
home TV programming — both live broadcasts and shows you’ve
recorded on your DVR — from any remote location with a broad-
band Internet connection (like a hotel or your office). The biggest
difference between the two is that Sony’s system supports playing
back content on the PSP handheld gaming device (which can con-
nect to Wi-Fi wireless networks). As we write, there’s no mobile
device capability here (beyond the PSP, that is), but we wouldn’t
be surprised to see that added in over time. You can find out more

Your journey through Home Theater Land continues
with a look at the heart of your system — the receiver
and controller devices. We start off this part by looking at
what’s really important about these systems in terms of
interfaces, power levels, multizone capabilities, and so on.
We also help you decide if you want an integrated box (a
receiver) or separate components. We even talk some
about power amplifiers, which is an area of conversation
that makes lots of guys — yes, 99 percent of guys, sorry —
very excited.
Then we walk you though a discussion of everything you’ve
ever wanted to know about speakers, building off the sur-
round sound knowledge from Part I.
The next chapter delves into your TV display options.
Your home theater’s display often overwhelms the home
theater with its presence — not to mention that, with dis-
plays that can go to 120 inches and higher, the options
can get really overwhelming. You can go in lots of direc-
tions, and we talk about HDTV, LCDs, plasma screens, and
other display choices.
Then we get to the projectors. We talk about all the 
latest technologies and devices — including all-in-one 
projectors — and the pros and cons for each. CRT, LCD,
DLP, LCoS — we’ve got all the hot acronyms here.
And then finally, we help you make your way through the
myriad of options for remotely controlling your system.

T
he A/V receiver is the hub of your home theater. It’s the device that has
both the brains and the brawn to control and drive your home theater
experience. A growing home theater market, intense competition, and com-
puter industry–like efficiencies at making electronic components have all
benefited the A/V receiver. It’s no longer a rarefied, esoteric piece of equip-
ment. In fact, you can get a good one for quite a reasonable price. Picking
through the lingo and marketing speak and choosing a good one can still be
difficult, but that’s why you bought this book!
In this chapter, we talk about the features and specifications that are impor-
tant to keep in mind as you evaluate A/V receivers. We also talk about a dif-
ferent approach to controlling your system — using separate A/V controllers
and power amplifier systems.
Digging In to the A/V Receiver
Think of the A/V receiver as the digital and electronic hub of your home the-
ater. An A/V receiver does a bunch of things, all in one nice and relatively
compact package. (It’s sort of the Swiss army knife of the home theater,

150
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
except you can’t fit one in your pocket.) Among the tasks assigned to the A/V
receiver are the following:
 Connects and switches your audio sources: Every audio source in your
home theater should connect to your A/V receiver. The preamplifier sec-
tion of the receiver allows you to easily switch to (or select) the audio
source that you want to listen to.
 Connects and switches your video sources: With a few exceptions
(which we discuss later), all your video source devices are also con-
nected directly to the A/V receiver, which is in turn connected to your
display device. This setup greatly simplifies the selection of video
sources when you want to play a DVD, a show recorded on a PVR (like a
TiVo), or anything else. In most cases, you select what you want to watch
on the receiver’s remote and don’t have to adjust anything on the display.
Some folks feel that they can get the highest video quality by not con-
necting video sources through the receiver. With the advent of high-
quality component video and even HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia
Interface) switching (see Chapter 16 for more on these connections), we
feel that there’s a lot to gain by switching your video through the receiver,
and little, if any, degradation in the quality of your video picture.
 Tunes in radio programming: Part of the definition of a receiver is that
it includes a radio tuner so you can tune in PBS or Kanye West (or what-
ever floats your boat between those two extremes).
A few A/V receivers are beginning to include satellite radio receivers for
XM or Sirius radio (see Chapter 5 for more on this). So if you want to get
Howard Stern, sports programming, or other satellite-exclusive content,
you might want to consider getting this capability built right into your
A/V receiver. You will, however, have to pay extra for the subscription.
 Decodes surround sound formats: The ability to decode analog and dig-
ital surround sound formats (we talk about these in Chapter 3) is one of
two features that distinguish an A/V receiver from a more traditional
stereo receiver (the plain old stereo you’ve had around for years).
 Amplifies audio signals to drive multiple speakers: Another distin-
guishing characteristic of an A/V receiver is the fact that it contains at
least five channels of amplification to drive (or provide power to) your
surround sound speaker system.
 Provides the user interface for your home theater: The interface
includes the receiver’s remote control (or your own favorite remote, as
we discuss in Chapter 15), the displays on the receiver’s face, and (in
many cases) an on-screen display on your television. All these elements
enable you, the human (or your dog, if he’s very talented), to command
all the electronic components in your home theater.

In the following sections, we discuss each of these A/V receiver responsibili-
ties in more detail.
Counting the inputs
Most people like to ooh and ahh at the bells and whistles — pretty design, big
macho power ratings, and the like. When evaluating any A/V receiver, how-
ever, we think a good place to begin is by counting the inputs that let you
connect source devices to the receiver. After all, if you have a DVD player, 
a cassette deck, a satellite receiver, an SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)
player, a turntable, a PVR (personal video recorder), an Xbox 360, and a VCR,
you want to hook all these devices into your home theater.
To use all your components, you’d better have enough inputs on the back of
your receiver. A receiver may have enough power to wake up people across
town and a design so beautiful that your home theater skeptic spouse begs
you to buy it, but that beauty won’t do you much good if have to climb
behind it and switch wires every time you want to switch sources. So before
you buy anything, think about the components you have (and what you’ll
soon be getting) and make sure the receiver has enough inputs.
Most A/V receivers have enough inputs for most people. We don’t want to
scare you. In fact, most have enough jacks on the back to make your head
swim. But many inexpensive receivers don’t have enough of the right kind of
jacks for some folks. This is particularly true for digital audio and video jacks
but can also be true for the analog audio inputs if you’ve decided to go down
the SACD or DVD-Audio path, which we cover in Chapter 5.
Deciphering digital audio inputs
Digital audio inputs (we show examples of these in Chapter 16) on an A/V
receiver let you connect the audio outputs of DVD players, CD players, game
consoles, HDTV tuners, Media Center PCs (Chapter 8), digital audio players
for MP3 and other computer audio (Chapter 10), and many newer digital
cable set-top boxes or DSS satellite receivers. Connecting these audio
sources by using digital inputs (instead of the traditional analog inputs) is
always a good idea because the digital signals are much less prone to electri-
cal interference than analog signals. A more important consideration is that
digital inputs are required to get digital surround sound formats, such as
Dolby Digital and DTS, into your receiver. (The two-channel analog outputs
on DVD players and other devices move you down to the lesser Dolby Pro
Logic surround sound system. You can’t get digital surround sound from
these connections.)
151
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

The one exception to this rule involves devices (mainly DVD players) that
have a built-in Dolby Digital or DTS surround sound decoder. You can con-
nect these to your receiver using analog audio connections, but this may not
be the optimal solution for the following reasons:
 You need to use six cables instead of one.
 You may lose some signal quality due to interference in the analog
signal.
 You need a receiver that has the necessary six analog inputs on the 
back — and even if you have these, they may be “taken up” by the six
channel outputs of a DVD-Audio or SACD player.
There are two types of digital audio connections (which we discuss in more
detail in Chapter 16): coaxial and optical. Some high-end audio folks believe
that the coaxial sounds better; it may have a slight sonic benefit, but not so
much that regular people can tell. Just make sure that you don’t buy a receiver
with three optical connections and one coaxial connection and then find you
have three source devices with coaxial connections only. Oops. (If you don’t
know what these look like, again look in Chapter 16.)
There’s actually a third type of digital connection that can carry digital 
audio signals — the HDMI connection, which is increasingly used for HDTV
tuners/satellite receivers and set-top boxes, and which is also moving its way
into other devices like DVD players (both regular DVD players and the next-
generation high-definition players we discuss in Chapter 6), and even in the
newest game consoles like the Xbox 360. If you use HDMI to connect these
devices to your home theater receiver, you don’t need to use a separate digi-
tal audio connection — the audio and video are both carried over the HDMI
connection.
Most A/V receivers — even new models — don’t support HDMI switching. So
if you want to use HDMI to connect your video, you’ll run an HDMI cable from
your source device directly to the TV, not to the receiver. In cases like this,
you’ll want to use a coaxial or optical digital audio connection to handle the
surround sound connection into your receiver. We discuss this in more detail
in Chapter 17.
The key measurement here is the total number of connections — as long as
the types of connections match up with your other equipment, which is usu-
ally not a problem because most source devices have both kinds of connec-
tors on back. Look again at the devices with digital connections mentioned at
the beginning of this section. Count how many of those devices with digital
outputs you have. Do the math. Many inexpensive receivers have only three
digital inputs (some even fewer). If all you have is a DVD player, you’ll be fine.
152
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

After a few years of home theatering, however, we bet you’ll have multiple
devices with digital outputs, so plan ahead.
It’s not just the number of digital inputs, but also the type of inputs. Most A/V
devices offer both a coaxial and an optical audio output, but some offer only
one or the other. Make sure that, when you are counting up your digital input
requirements, you account for the number of coaxial and optical inputs you
need and choose a receiver accordingly.
Analyzing analog audio inputs
Now that we spent all that time telling you that digital inputs are so much
better than analog inputs, why are we emphasizing analog inputs’ importance
now? Well, first of all, they’re not really that awful. We think digital connec-
tions are the way to go when they’re available, but analog is just fine when
it’s all you can get. Devices that use analog audio connections include the 
following:
 Older CD players (without a digital output)
 External radio tuners
 Analog VCRs
 Cable set-top and DSS receivers without digital outputs
 Cassette recorders
 Older game consoles (such as Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation)
 The newest digital audio sources, SACD and DVD-A, which we discuss in
Chapter 5
A move is afoot in the consumer electronics industry to allow digital connec-
tions for these last two devices. The connection would use FireWire, a com-
puter technology often used for connecting portable hard drives, camcorders,
iPods, and other devices to computers. As we write, a few receiver manufactur-
ers have begun putting these FireWire ports on their receivers, but when and if
this will ever take off is unclear.
Just about any device that uses a digital audio connection into your receiver —
discussed in the previous section — can also use analog audio connections. We
recommend using digital connections to your receiver when they’re available,
but if they’re not, don’t forget the fact that you can go analog. It may just get
that piece of gear connected and save the day!
All the devices we mention in this list — except for SACD and DVD-Audio —
use a simple pair of analog audio connections, one for the left channel and
one for the right. It’s not hard to figure these out. Just count up your inputs
153
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

on the receiver and count up your devices. The inputs on the receiver are
labeled, and these labels correspond to the buttons on the front of the con-
sole and on your remote control. It’s always nice if the names on the receiver’s
inputs match input names on the device that you’re connecting the receiver
to, but it’s not essential. It may not even be possible if you have some funky
device that no one ever thought of when your receiver was designed.
The one exception to this flexibility in making connections are the inputs on
your receiver marked phono. These are for your record player (phonograph)
and are not standard inputs. If you have a record player, use these inputs for
it. If you don’t have a record player, don’t use these inputs for anything else.
If you do use them, it won’t blow anything up, but it will sound amazingly
awful, and your dog will hide under the bed until you turn it off.
For DVD-Audio and SACD players, you need a special set of analog inputs with
six connectors. These formats can support multichannel audio (five channels
plus a subwoofer for bass) and therefore need the extra inputs. Many newer
receivers have a six-input section (called a 5.1 analog input), so you can use an
SACD or DVD-A player.
Some receivers also have a section on the back with six (or more!) inputs 
for an external decoder. These allow you to hook up a newer decoder in the
future. The idea is that the future decoder will handle surround sound for-
mats that weren’t even thought of when the receiver was designed — a nice
bit of futureproofing.
The 5.1-channel input for DVD-A/SACD and the input for an external decoder
are functionally identical. Some receivers will have one set of 5.1 inputs labeled
for DVD-A/SACD and another labeled for an external decoder. Others have only
one set. In the majority of cases, you can use these inputs for either purpose.
Some receivers also have a set of six similar-looking outputs. These allow you
to bypass the internal amplifiers in the receiver and use a set of separate,
more powerful amplifiers to drive your speakers. Again, this is a nice feature
to look for if you think you might need more power some time in the future.
Verifying video inputs
When hooking up a home theater, some folks try to connect all their video
devices directly to the TV or display, but they usually don’t succeed because
most displays have a rather limited set of inputs on the back (though some
have a ton). We prefer to connect all our video devices directly to the receiver
and let the receiver switch (that is, select) which video source goes to the dis-
play. It’s just easier, neater, and simpler that way.
We’re talking about the video signal coming out of these devices here. They
all have an audio signal as well (for the soundtrack), and that should also be
connected to the receiver using one of the two methods described in the 
154
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

previous sections. You won’t get any surround sound if you don’t perform
that basic step.
As we discuss in Chapter 16, there are four common types of video connec-
tions (in order of worst to best): coaxial (also called baseband — rarely
found in a receiver), composite, S-Video, and component. (There are also dig-
ital connections for some HDTV tuners and sources, but these connections
are designed to connect directly into the TV.) Virtually every A/V receiver has
yellow color-coded composite video inputs on the back. (They’re usually
right next to the audio inputs for a source device, so they’re labeled DVD
or VCR, and so on.) Coaxial is the pits, so the less said about it the better.
Composite video basically stinks (relative to S-video and component), so use
it only for low-resolution video sources, such as low-end VCRs; otherwise,
just leave those composite plugs unused.
What you want to look for in a receiver are S-Video connections (at a minimum)
or component video connections (on fancier, more expensive receivers). The
picture quality you get when using these connections is almost always better
than what you get with a composite video connection. S-Video connections can
be found on better VCRs (the S-VHS models), most DVD players, DSS receivers,
digital cable set-top boxes, PVRs, and on modern gaming consoles (Xbox 360,
PlayStation 2, or GameCube, for example). Component video connections can
be found on better DVD players (they’re required for progressive-scan DVD),
HDTV tuners, the gaming consoles we just mentioned, and even on the latest
PVRs (such as the ReplayTV 5000).
HDTV signals need a special kind of component video connection called a
wideband component video connection. Some receivers have component
video connections but can’t handle the higher frequencies of HDTV. If a speci-
fication is given, look for something higher than 25 MHz.
Until quite recently, component video inputs were a rarity on inexpensive
and even moderately priced receivers. Because the popularity of DVD and
other sources that can use component video (particularly HDTV) has risen,
however, component video has moved into the mainstream. You’ll still have 
a hard time finding a $500 receiver with more than two sets of component
inputs, but for many people, that’s enough. You can use S-Video for non-
progressive or non-HDTV sources (such as a PlayStation 2) and reserve the
component inputs for your progressive-scan DVD and your HDTV tuner.
Many otherwise excellent displays have only a single-component video input,
and few displays have enough S-Video inputs for everything you might want
to connect to them. This is a strong argument for finding a receiver that has a
sufficient number of inputs. Like the audio inputs discussed earlier, this is a
pretty simple thing to factor in while you are shopping. Count up what you
have that uses S-Video or component video and start eliminating A/V
receivers that don’t have what you need from your shopping list.
155
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

Switching sources
With all these inputs, an A/V receiver can do all the source switching for your
home theater system. Plug all your source devices into the receiver, connect
your speakers and display to the receiver’s outputs, and let the receiver do
the work of sending audio and video to these devices — rather than having a
bunch of individual cables running to your display. As we mention earlier,
most displays simply don’t have enough inputs (particularly on the video
side) to allow you to connect the myriad video sources you have (or will
soon have) directly into them. Allowing the A/V receiver to concentrate and
switch between all these sources just plain makes sense.
As you audition receivers, check out the quality of their video switching. We
can’t give you a quantitative piece of advice here, but we can tell you to do
some research. Read the reviews. Most good reviewers comment on the
video switching capabilities. If you can, do your own quick test. Watch a bit of
video on a DVD player hooked up through the receiver and then try watching
the same video using the same type of connection plugged directly into the
display. Hopefully, you won’t see a difference, but if the picture is softer or
less detailed when running through the receiver, then maybe it’s not the
receiver you want.
Another factor to keep in mind regarding video switching is how the A/V
receiver itself connects to the display. You may have a mixture of composite,
S-Video, and component video connections running into the receiver from
your source devices. It’s very likely that you will, in fact. Some more capable
receivers convert signals from lower-quality to higher-quality connections.
For example, a receiver may convert all composite and S-Video incoming con-
nections to component video. This doesn’t make the picture any better, but it
does enable you to use a single output connection from the receiver to the
display. It also enables you to set the display on its component input and
then just leave it there and forget it, which is pretty handy.
Many receivers use the home theater display to provide on-screen system
controls. If your system converts composite or S-Video to a higher-quality
connection, make sure it also sends the on-screen display over that connec-
tion. Switching the display back to the composite video input just to tweak a
control is a real pain in the tonsils (as Pat’s mom says — though he’s not sure
what that means).
Understanding upconversion
A feature that has hit the market recently (and that we think can be really
handy) is video upconversion. Essentially, a receiver with upconversion takes
lower-resolution video input (like composite or S-video) and converts it to a
higher-resolution format, like component video or even HDMI.
156
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

There are two primary reasons to consider video upconversion in a receiver:
 Fewer cables
 Improved picture quality
You’ll see two types of upconversion when you’re shopping for receivers:
 Component upconversion
 HDMI upconversion
Assessing your amplifier
Another essential job for any A/V receiver involves amplifying outgoing audio
signals so that your speakers can do their thing. We discuss in greater detail
how speakers work in the following chapter, but for now let’s just say that they
are based on electromagnetic systems that need a lot of electricity. The electri-
cal signals coming out of audio source devices, however, are relatively low-
powered. The amplifier does what its name says; it increases this power level.
157
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver
Uh oh, too few inputs on your receiver?
Sometimes, you do your homework and buy a
receiver with enough inputs, and then some
new video source plops into your life unan-
nounced, leaving you an input or two short. (Or
maybe you just plain fell in love with a receiver
that didn’t have enough inputs. We forgive you.)
What to do?
Well, first check your display for extra inputs on
the back (or front). Using these isn’t quite as
neat and integrated as using the receiver, but
doing so won’t hurt your quality at all.
If you’re still running short, look into an external
video switcher. You can get your hands on a
cheap one at any electronics or home theater
store. You usually switch this device manually
(meaning you walk up to it and push a button).
Switchers accept composite or S-Video con-
nections and have a single output on the back
to run to your display. If you want to go for qual-
ity (and can afford to spend a bit more), check
out the Monster Cable’s Entech line of products
(www.monstercable.com/entech). For
about $350, you can get a system that accepts
composite or S-Video connections from up to
four devices and converts them into a single 
S-Video output for connecting to your A/V
receiver (or directly to the display). This system
also connects the corresponding analog audio
signals and features an automatic switching
system. Whichever source is actively playing is
switched to the output connections (you can
manually override this, too).

Unscrambling power ratings
The first thing most folks look at when they see a shiny new receiver sitting
on display is the power rating. The rating is measured in watts per channel
(usually measured as RMS, or root mean square, instead of peak, which
means that it is a measure of sustained power, not the highest possible
instantaneous peak). The problem is that you can’t take these ratings at face
value because manufacturers play a lot of interesting tricks when they give
these watt ratings. The result is that a receiver can be more or less powerful
than another receiver with the same rating. To really get a feel for a receiver’s
power, examine the following four things closely:
 Distortion: Power is measured at a certain number of watts at a certain
level of distortion (noise created by the amplifier). You want low distor-
tion (of course). The tricky part comes in when you examine how the
amplifier’s power output is measured — specifically at what distortion
level it’s measured. An amp that is measured, for example, at 100 watts
per channel at 0.02 percent THD (total harmonic distortion, the standard
measurement) is quieter and is probably more powerful than one that is
measured at 100 watts per channel at 0.2 percent THD. You can really do
a direct comparison only if both are measured at the same THD percent-
age. Another way of looking at this issue is this fact: If manufacturers
measure power at a higher distortion rating, they can squeeze more “on
paper” power out of the receiver.
 Impedance: Almost all amplifiers are rated at 8 ohms impedance (a mea-
sure of electrical resistance, discussed in Chapter 12), so you can com-
pare ratings this way, but a few are also measured at 6 or even 4 ohms.
These lower resistances can give an artificially high power rating — be
suspicious.
Not all amplifiers built into receivers (or even in separate power ampli-
fiers) can power 4-ohm speakers without overheating, popping a circuit
breaker, or just plain breaking down. Check to see whether a receiver
can support these lower impedances if you choose speakers that require
it. This is rare unless you are buying some really high-end gear — most
home theater speaker systems are rated at 8 ohms of impedance
(though the actual number varies as the speakers reproduce different
frequencies).
 Frequency range: Lower frequencies (the bass frequencies) require more
amplifier power than higher frequencies. Because of this, some receiver
manufacturers test their systems not at the full 20 to 20,000 Hz range
(which is what we call full range), but with a limited range (such as 40 to
20,000 Hz). This can also create an artificially high power rating. Receivers
that are measured at full range are often called full bandwidth rated.
158
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

 Number of channels driven: Home theater receivers should be capable
of driving at least five speakers (some have amplifiers for six, seven, or
more speakers for extra surround channels). Power ratings should state
how many speakers are actually being driven when the system is tested.
Preferably, all channels are driven simultaneously at the stated power.
Some systems give power ratings in stereo mode (with only the front left
and right speakers driven), which means that the power with all speak-
ers being driven is less than the stated amount.
Determining how much receiver power you need
How much power do you need in your receiver? Well, we’re going to weasel
out by saying, “It depends.” Which speakers you choose plays a key role
here. Different speakers have different sensitivities, a measure of how loud
they are, given a certain amount of power. The standard measure for this is
how many decibels they produce with 1 watt of power at 1 meter’s distance
from the speaker. A more sensitive speaker requires less amplification to
reach the same volume level.
You also need to consider the size of your home theater and how loudly you
plan on playing your movies and music. If you want to create permanent
hearing loss, or if you have a room the size of the Taj Mahal, you might need
a receiver that can pump out 150 watts per channel. If you have relatively
sensitive speakers, a moderately sized home theater, and don’t plan on test-
ing the thickness of your window glass with really loud music, then a receiver
with 70 watts per channel (or less) might do the trick. We think that receivers
with about 100 watts per channel (honestly measured) will do the trick in just
about any home theater.
Amplifiers (whether separate or in a receiver) make their power by using
transistors. In the old days, amplifiers used vacuum tubes, and some really
expensive high-end amps still use tubes because some audio enthusiasts
prefer their sound. Inexpensive receivers use an IC (integrated circuit), which
provides the power-generating transistors for several audio channels on a
single chip. Better receivers have discrete amplifier output transistors — 
separate transistors for each channel. Typically, you get more power and
better sound from a discrete design.
Zoning out to the rest of the house
Many home theater receivers — particularly when you start hitting about
$1,000 or higher in price — include a multizone functionality. This lets your
receiver not only control your home theater, but also provide music to other
rooms in your house. A multizone receiver is a good way to get started down
the whole-home theater path.
159
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

The simplest multizone receivers have a pair of stereo audio outputs (not
speaker connectors or amplifier channels, just outputs). These outputs
enable you to run an audio cable to another room and connect to a separate
amplifier and speakers in that room (or to a pair of active speakers that have
a built-in amplifier). The key feature to look for here is that this second zone
is truly a second zone. That is to say, the receiver lets you send a different
audio source to the second room, not just the one you are playing in the
home theater. So the kids can listen to Barney the dinosaur sing, “I love you,”
in the den, while you watch Memento in the home theater.
As you get into more sophisticated systems, you can find receivers with extra
built-in amplifiers (so you don’t need an amp in the extra room) and with
extra zones (so you can send different audio sources to a third or fourth
room). You may even find multizone A/V receivers that send out a composite
video signal. With this signal, you can watch the video from a home theater
video source elsewhere in the home.
In Chapter 18, we get into more detail about sharing home theater sources
throughout the home. If you want to get really sophisticated with a true
“every room in the house” system, you might need some more gear (which
we discuss in that chapter).
Having fun with DSPs and decoders
Another key responsibility of the A/V receiver is to decode surround sound
formats in your audio and video programming so that sound can be sent to
those six or more speakers in your theater. Two kinds of chips in the receiver
handle all this digital magic: the DSP and the DAC.
Digital Signal Processors
The DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is the brains of the decoding process. 
This chip handles all the steering of surround sound, sending musical 
signals to the correct channels. The DSP also can provide its own sound 
field enhancements — essentially electronic changes in tone and timing
(echoes) — though some people hate them and wouldn’t use the term
enhancement to describe them! These enhancements are called DSP Modes,
which are modifications to the signal to create delays in the sound. The
delays can make your home theater sound like something else — for exam-
ple, a cathedral or a smoky jazzy club (you have to provide your own smoke).
One feature that DSPs enable (and that we love!) is the ability to dynamically
compress music and, more importantly, movie soundtracks. Dynamic com-
pression makes the louds less loud and also makes the quiet parts not quite
so quiet. When someone is sleeping two rooms over while you watch a movie
at night, you don’t necessarily want that Top Gun F-14 flying overhead at full
160
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

roar. (Pat was in the Navy and spent too much time in the Persian Gulf with
jets taking off about 15 feet over his head and doesn’t ever want to hear that
again, but that’s a different story.) This feature, often called nighttime mode,
is really great for family harmony.
Many receiver manufacturers make a big deal about which DSP they use. It
does make a difference, and some aficionados have their own preferences.
The key is that the DSP can support the decoding of the surround sound for-
mats you want and need in your home theater. At a minimum, you should
pick a receiver that can decode Dolby Digital and DTS (the plain-Jane 5.1 ver-
sions of these standards) and Dolby Pro Logic II (for VHS and other nondigi-
tal sources). We like receivers that can also decode Dolby Pro Logic IIx,
which does a much better job on VHS and regular TV — luckily Pro Logic IIx
is becoming pretty much standard these days.
If you’re getting into a six- or seven-channel system, then you want a receiver
that can support DTS-ES or Dolby Digital EX (or THX Surround EX). We don’t
think that’s necessary for an entry-level home theater, but if you’re getting
fancy, why not?
And as the high-definition DVD formats (Blu-ray and HD-DVD) start hitting the
market, you’ll want to support them with a receiver that can handle Dolby’s
TrueHD and Digital Plus as well as DTS’s DTS HD formats, all discussed in
Chapter 3. As we go to press, these new standards haven’t hit the main-
stream, but we expect them to become common in the near future.
Digital Analog Converters
DACs (or Digital Analog Converters) take the digitally encoded musical sig-
nals (from a Dolby Digital or DTS DVD soundtrack or the PCM — short for
Pulse Code Modulation, a standard way of storing digital audio — from a
compact disc connected digitally) and convert these digital signals into
analog signals that the receiver’s amplifier and the speakers can understand.
Receiver vendors seem to be going through some kind of a race with DACs
these days. Each vendor is coming out with models that have new DACs with
even higher capacities.
DACs are rated by the frequency of digital signal and the number of bits they
can decode (for example, 96 kHz and 24 bits). We’ve seen receivers with mul-
tiple DACs (up to 16 in a single receiver) rated at 192 kHz and 24 bits. You
should choose a receiver with at least 96 kHz/24-bit DACs. If digital connec-
tions for systems such as SACD or DVD-Audio ever become common, those
higher-capacity DACs will become a minimum recommendation (today, they
are not, in our minds).
Sometimes, you don’t want to mess with all that digital stuff. Analog signals
coming into the receiver are typically converted to digital signals (using
ADCs — the opposite of DACs). The digital signals run through the DSP and
161
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

are then converted back to analog signals with the DACs. Many audio purists
feel that all this conversion can create minor (but to them, not insignificant)
distortions in the audio. If your receiver has analog bypass, you can stay in
straight, old-fashioned, pure analog all the way to the amplifier section. We
recommend analog bypass for the analog inputs from an SACD or DVD-Audio
player, as well as for turntable inputs. Some receivers automatically bypass
the digital stuff for these inputs, whereas others have a switch on the remote.
Some don’t bypass it at all; so if you want this feature, check to see if your
receiver will give it to you.
Dealing with bass
Connecting a subwoofer (or more than one if you love the bass) to your
home theater is an essential part of providing the sound for your movies and
TV. The majority of subwoofers are active (they have their own built-in ampli-
fiers). You need an output on your A/V receiver to connect a standard analog
audio cable to the subwoofer. On most receivers, this output is labeled the
LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channel and is indicated by the “.1” part of 5.1-,
6.1-, and 7.1-channel surround sound formats. We highly recommend you get a
receiver with this output, and most will have one — it’s pretty much assured if
you buy a Dolby Digital– or DTS-equipped receiver.
The other subwoofer-related thing to look for is an adjustable crossover that
lets you select which audio frequencies go to the subwoofer and which go to
the main front speakers. Different speaker systems sound better with the
crossover set at different frequencies. If you have small bookshelf speakers in
the front, you might set the crossover to a higher frequency. If you have a set
of huge tower speakers with giant woofers (bass speakers) of their own, you
might set the crossover to a lower frequency and let the subwoofer concen-
trate on only the really deep sounds.
We discuss speakers in more detail in Chapter 12.
Interfacing with your receiver
A/V receivers control a lot of things in your system, such as selection of
audio and video sources, volume, surround sound formats, relative volume
levels for surround speakers, and more. You interface with the receiver
through the buttons and knobs on the front and, more importantly, through
the remote control.
The receiver gives you feedback on your control actions through one or both
of two means: lights and displays on the face of the receiver and an on-screen
display on your television set. We like on-screen displays (they’re easier to
162
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

read), and we’d be willing to bet you will, too. However, you’re not going to
find this feature on most inexpensive receivers.
Whether or not you have an on-screen display, we think that checking out
how the receiver’s interface works is important. For example, most receivers
use menu-driven controls (like the menus in a computer program). In some
cases, you need to push a lot of buttons and navigate through several menus
to get to important controls. That’s okay for things you set once and forget
about (such as your initial setup), but such controls are a real pain for proce-
dures you do over and over again (such as selecting a video or audio source).
We like systems that have easy-to-understand menus and direct access to key
functions (meaning you have to press only one button to get to them).
When evaluating a receiver’s interface, you also want to check out the remote
control. These days, most A/V receivers can control other devices (such as
DVD players). Many remotes are learning or programmable ones that can con-
trol devices from other manufacturers. Cheaper programmable remotes work
only with equipment from the same manufacturer. When you start getting
fancy, you find remotes that are backlit (so you can see them in the dark) 
or even touch screen remotes (with a touch-sensitive LCD panel instead of a
million tiny little buttons). We talk about remotes in much more detail in
Chapter 15.
Making the Separates Decision
As you start moving up the price scale, you begin to reach a decision point:
Do you want to stick with a (very very good) all-in-one high-end A/V receiver,
or do you want to move into separates? Separates break down the functions
of the receiver into three (you guessed it) separate components: a radio
tuner, a power amplifier (or power amplifiers), and an A/V controller. You can
probably guess what the tuner and amplifiers do; the controller performs the
switching and preamplification tasks (basically, adjusting the levels of audio
signals to control your volume) and includes the DSPs and DACs that do sur-
round sound decoding and conversion of digital audio into analog audio.
You might go with separates for a couple of reasons:
 More flexibility: A separates system lets you choose exactly which com-
ponents you want. Like the amplifiers from Brand X, but the controller
functions from Brand Y? Mix and match! Separates give you a more flexi-
ble upgrade path, too. If you buy a Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 decoder
but someday want to move up to Dolby Digital Plus (or some future sur-
round sound format), you only need to upgrade the decoder, not the
whole system. Keep in mind that you might have to buy extra amplifiers
for extra surround sound channels, but that’s easy to do.
163
Chapter 11: The Heart of a Home Theater: The A/V Receiver

 Better performance: A/V receivers can offer really excellent sound qual-
ity, but for that last little bit of sonic realism, separates can offer the ulti-
mate in sound. Putting all the electronics for your A/V components in
separate chassis can reduce the possibility of these electronic gizmos
interfering with each other and causing distortions in your sound. For
example, many folks going the separates route buy fancy mono power
amplifiers — a separate amplifier (with its own power supply and other
internal components) for each channel. Most people don’t have the
space, budget, or (to be realistic) the need for such a setup. But it’s a
nice possibility to consider.
We talk about separate components in more detail in Chapter 21, where we
talk about moving up to the high end of home theater. If you can afford the
additional expense, you might want to consider using separates. If you don’t
want to spend any more than you have to and prefer the simplicity (and
space savings) of an all-in-one solution, stick with an A/V receiver.

A
lthough your video display often hogs all the attention in your home
theater, the speaker system is what really makes your theater sing — 
literally.
Speaker systems don’t get the attention they deserve. Many people actually
see the speaker system as almost an afterthought — something that is bun-
dled with the receiver or other equipment. Speakers have a double curse:
They lack oodles of fancy features and display screens, and the features they
do have are tied up with very technical descriptions that most people can’t
decipher.
Not paying enough attention to your speaker system is a huge mistake. People
notice bad audio a lot faster than they notice bad video. In this chapter, we
explain how to evaluate your speakers, and we discuss issues to think about
when buying speakers for your home theater. In Chapters 17 and 19, we talk
about how to install your speakers and tweak them to perfection.
Understanding How Speakers Work
Unlike other components in your system, speakers are differentiated (more
than anything else) by somewhat obscure technical characteristics. So an
understanding of how speakers actually work may be just what you need in
order to stay un-glassy-eyed when we go on and on about making sure your
speakers are in phase and things like that.

166
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Drivers
Speakers are actually relatively simple devices. Basically, you have an enclo-
sure (typically a box) into which speaker drivers are attached. The drivers are
the round elements that many people call the actual speakers (they’re not).
The drivers look like cones or horns (or even ribbons or domes), and in fact,
the large surface area of the drivers is called the cone or diaphragm. These
surfaces move back and forth to make the sound. If you have ever pulled the
front screen off your speakers or have seen speakers without their front grille
on, you’ve seen speaker drivers au naturelle.
Driver sizes
Drivers come in different sizes and modes, but generally speaking, you’ll find
three types, based on the frequencies they handle:
 Tweeter driver: These handle the high-frequency treble range (above
2,000 Hz).
 Midrange driver: These, not surprisingly, handle the midrange frequen-
cies (200 Hz to 2,000 Hz).
 Woofer driver: These handle the low-frequency bass range (below 200 Hz).
No single driver is well suited to handle all sounds from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz;
multiple drivers are commonly used to be able to span the full spectrum. A
speaker that handles the full frequency is called, not surprisingly, a full-range
speaker.
How drivers work
Speaker driver cones are typically made from paper, plastic, or metal. This
material moves back and forth and creates changes in the air pressure (sound
waves) that ultimately arrive at your eardrum and cause it to move back and
forth in a corresponding fashion. This causes you to hear the sound. The cone
is moved by an electromagnetic process that’s caused by a coil of wire, called
the voice coil, at the base of the cone. The electrical impulses coming from the
amplifier (or the amplifiers built in to your receiver) drive the voice coil, and
the voice coil interacts with a permanent magnet attached to the speaker’s
cone (or dome or whatever shape it may take). (If you want a great explana-
tion of how speakers work in more detail, check out www.howstuffworks.
com/speaker.htm.)
Drivers come in all sorts of different sizes, but (again) generally speaking, the
larger the driver is, the lower the frequencies it was designed for. Because
higher frequencies require sound waves that have high and low pressure
points close together, the cone must be smaller to be able to move back and
forth fast enough to keep up. Lower frequencies have to move back and forth
more slowly, and smaller drivers have a hard time with these. So you find
that drivers are designed for specific audio frequency ranges.

Most speakers that have multiple drivers in their speaker enclosure have
electronic circuits known as crossovers, which divide up inbound speaker 
signals and distribute them to the appropriate driver.
Drivers in speaker-market lingo
You’ll most often run into two types of speakers on the market:
 Two-way: These have a woofer and a tweeter in one speaker enclosure.
 Three-way: These have a woofer, tweeter, and a midrange driver in the
same enclosure.
You’ll also run into speakers with multiple tweeters or midrange drivers, and
occasionally four-way speakers with two of the frequencies divided up among
four different drivers (or four different sets of drivers — for example two
tweeters and two pairs of different sized midrange drivers). You can even find
some speakers (typically smaller satellite speakers designed for wall mount-
ing) with only one driver to handle both the bass and the treble. There’s a
huge amount of variety out there.
More drivers doesn’t always mean better sound, but often speakers with mul-
tiple drivers sound better because each of the individual woofer, midrange,
and tweeter drivers can be optimized to reproduce a very specific range of
frequencies. Keep in mind that it’s hard for a driver to reproduce the whole
range of audio frequencies equally well.
The use of the cone-shaped diaphragm and electromagnetic-powered move-
ment is specific to dynamic speakers, the class of speakers we’ve been dis-
cussing so far in this chapter. Generally, these are the speakers we recommend
for home theater. We should tell you, though, that you may run across other
speakers when touring your local audio showroom or electronics superstore —
speakers that are more expensive and that are used for specific purposes. In
most cases, we don’t recommend the following speakers for home theater use:
 Electrostatic speakers: These are used primarily for stereo audio listen-
ing and are rare in home theater systems. They can’t handle bass and
are rather limited in where and how you position them.
 Planar-magnetic speakers: For similar reasons, these are not likely to be
useful for your home theater application because they are best used for
the higher frequencies only.
We mention electrostatic and planar-magnetic speakers in case someone 
tries to sell you some; unless you really know what you’re doing with these
types of speakers, you’re better off spending your money on quality dynamic
speakers.
167
Chapter 12: Speaker of the House

The pole position
You’ll also run into speakers with more than one set of speaker drivers, facing
in different directions:
 Monopole: These speakers have all the drivers on one face of the enclo-
sure and are known as direct radiating speakers. These can be used any-
where in your home theater.
 Bipole: These speakers have drivers on two faces, opposite each other.
These are designed for the side/rear surround speaker applications.
 Dipole: These speakers have drivers on two faces, opposite each other.
These are designed for the side/rear surround speaker applications.
Bipole and dipole speakers sound pretty much the same, huh? Well,
physically they are quite alike, but we’ll discuss in the following section
how the differ functionally.
 Omnipole: These speakers radiate their sound in all directions, in a 360-
degree fashion, and are popular for outdoor applications. We won’t talk
much about these here, but know they exist.
To understand the difference between bipole and dipole speakers, we have to
get technical for a minute, but it’s an important tangent discussion.
Harken back to your science class days when you studied topics of phase,
specifically being in phase and out of phase. If you recall, in a general sense,
something is in phase when it acts in the same pattern and time session as
something else, and out of phase when it doesn’t. Because controlling the
way sound waves interact with each other is a key component of home the-
ater, you have to deal with the concept of phase.
Bipole and dipole speakers are designed specifically to help contribute to
your surround sound field. All you need to know for now, however, are some
basics about how they work. Bipole speakers fire their cones to the front and
rear (remember, they have drivers on two planes) at the same time and in
phase. In other words, the cones go out or in together, in the same direction
(both out or both in) and at the same time. Dipole speakers are out of phase
with each other. When one side’s drivers are pushing out, the other side’s dri-
vers are pulling in. See the section, “Surround speakers,” later in this chapter,
for an explanation of how these speakers help create surround sound.
Although the electrical phase in bipoles and dipoles is different, the basic
construction of bipoles and dipoles is very similar. You can find speakers on
the market that can be both bipoles and dipoles. Most of these speakers have
a switch that lets you switch the mode they operate in. Some people prefer
music played back through bipoles and movies through dipoles, and these
speakers let you make that choice on the fly.
168
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Enclosed for your convenience
Your speaker enclosure, it turns out, is pretty critical. You see, with all the
shaking your drivers do, if you have a rather flimsy speaker encasement, then
it’s either going to make a lot of noise, fall apart, or both. Your enclosure
should be able to handle the vibrations with ease and should add little sound
interference to the sound emanating from the drivers.
You’ll run into two major types of enclosures: sealed (also known as acoustic
suspension) enclosures and ported (also known as bass reflex) enclosures. A
sealed enclosure is what it sounds like; it’s an airtight case. As your driver
moves back and forth, the air pressure in the speaker constantly changes.
This puts extra pressure from behind on the diaphragm as it moves in and
out, and that takes extra power to overcome. On the positive side, however,
that extra pressure makes the cone snap back and forth faster and with more
precision, giving you a crisper, more accurate sound.
A more efficient speaker design is the ported or bass reflex enclosure. In the
front of these enclosures is a hole (port) that equalizes pressure between the
inside and outside of the speaker. When the diaphragm moves back into the
speaker, it increases the internal pressure, which is funneled out through the
front port of the speaker. This augments the sound waves traveling from the
speaker, and increases the efficiency tremendously. The downside is that,
from a reproductive sound perspective, you may get less accurate results
from bass reflex enclosures. That’s because they don’t have the benefit of 
the extra pressure influencing the reverberating diaphragm. So the speaker
sound might reproduce bass notes less precisely — substituting a louder
boominess for a more realistic reproduction of the low notes. (Less realistic
reproduction here means that your low notes don’t have as much house-
shaking “oomph” as they should.)
Bass reflex enclosures can dramatically decrease your power requirements
because they increase the bass output of a speaker by around 3 dB compared
to a sealed enclosure. To match a 3 dB output boost through amplification,
the power applied to the speaker needs to be doubled. So if a bass reflex
enclosure speaker was powered with a 150-watt amplifier, a sealed enclosure
speaker would require a 300-watt amplifier to produce the same output.
That’s a pretty awesome improvement.
In the end, you can be happy with either sealed or bass reflex designs. Just
keep in mind that these units handle bass differently and that good design
and construction can minimize problems associated with either speaker
design.
169
Chapter 12: Speaker of the House

Inside, outside, upside down?
As if all this were not enough, you’ll probably run into four generic shape and
size categories of speakers for your home entertainment system:
 Floorstanding: These speakers can be as tall as you are, can handle the
full range of frequencies, and may or may not own the low-bass frequen-
cies often taken over by the subwoofer.
 Bookshelf: These aptly named speakers are designed for smaller foot-
prints (the amount of space they take up). You often find them on a
bookshelf or discreetly mounted on the wall. Sometimes, you see them
on speaker stands to bring them up to ear-level (which is the best way
to install these types of speakers, in our opinion). They are usually
designed to handle the midrange and high-end frequencies and are typi-
cally mated to a subwoofer in your installation. You may hear bookshelf
speakers described as satellite speakers.
Many manufacturers have designed special bookshelf-style speakers
with mounting brackets and a sleek (and thin) enclosure designed for
wall mounting next to a flat-panel plasma or LCD display. These speakers
are usually referred to as wall mounts.
 Subwoofer: These speakers are larger and heavier than the bookshelf
models and are usually kept on the floor due to their size and weight.
These contain the large drivers for low-frequency use.
 In-wall: In-wall speakers share most of their characteristics with the
bookshelf models; these are smaller speakers designed more for the
midrange and high-end frequencies. Although some have enclosures
that are mounted into the wall, the majority of these systems use the
wall’s own enclosed nature as its enclosure. The drivers and other
pieces and parts (like the crossovers) are mounted in a frame mounted
flush with the wall or ceiling.
In general, in-wall speakers are more for whole-home background music
and to contribute to the surround sound of a home theater. For the most
part, the benefit of these speakers is their ability to be installed in places
that have more aesthetic than acoustic appeal. They stay tucked away in
corners or low on walls, but their acoustical contribution is mainly for
background and surround types of sound. Also, depending on the con-
struction of the walls themselves, in-wall speakers that lack their own
enclosure may spread sound along the wall rather than direct sound for-
ward. If you find yourself planning in-wall speakers, take some extra time
to study up on the best ways to optimize their location and performance.
This is not to say that there aren’t good-sounding in-wall speakers —
there are, and many high-end manufacturers make in-wall speakers these
days. But good in-walls are typically more expensive than otherwise com-
parable bookshelf or floorstanding speakers.
170
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Active and passive speakers
Finally, all speakers, regardless of the number of drivers, pole type, enclosure
type, or whatever, fall into one of two categories: active or passive. How
they’re classified depends on their relationship to the amplifier driving them.
The vast majority of speakers are passive. A passive speaker doesn’t have a
built-in amplifier; it needs to be connected to your amplifier through normal
speaker wire. This speaker-level signal has been amplified enough to drive
the speakers sufficiently.
Active speakers, on the other hand, have a built-in amplifier and are fed by a
low-level (line-level) signal passed along an interconnect cable originating at
your preamplifier or controller. Because the amplifier is an active electronic
device, it needs power, and so you have to put any active speakers near
power outlets.
171
Chapter 12: Speaker of the House
Stereostone Age
If you decide to extend your home theater out-
side the boundaries of your home theater room,
you may consider outdoor speakers because
they are pertinent for your gardens, pool areas,
and soon-to-be-outdoor theater greens.
All the discussion in this speaker section is per-
tinent to shopping for outdoor speakers. One of
the leading vendors is Stereostone (www.
stereostone.com), which makes speakers
in all sorts of simulated rock forms and colors,
like brown sandstone and black lava. There are
omni-directional speakers, subwoofers, and
even stereo fountains. You can get them with or
without visible grills in the layers of the rock,
and with volume controls for individual speaker
control. All this in weatherproof enclosures that
start as low as $150 and go up to $1,000 for the
most sophisticated models.
Connections are everything
When connecting your receiver or amplifier to
your speakers, you’re pretty much going to find
two types of connectors: spring clips and five-
way binding posts. Spring clips are considered
the lower end of the two, and most audiophiles
tend to put them down. You see, spring clips
have more exposed wiring, less surface contact,
and greater likelihood of signal degradation over
time due to this exposed wiring. Five-way bind-
ing posts, on the other hand, have a much more
flexible connection structure. Not surprisingly,
you can connect at least five ways. There are
pin-form connectors, spade lugs, banana plugs,
and a large washer-like area at the base that
allows for more extensive contact with bare
wire. There’s too much to try to put into words
here; we recommend that you get someone at a
stereo store to show you a five-way binding
post. Just know that the five-way binding posts
are the way to go if you have a choice.

For most home theaters, the subwoofer is probably going to be your only
active speaker (though you can also find passive subwoofers, and some high-
end home theater systems use these). There’s no practical reason for any of
your other speakers to be active. Active speakers limit your ability to pick
amplifiers tailored to your home theater and are generally more expensive
options than what we’ve been talking about. They are also much harder to
find. Most active speakers either fall into the low price/low-end category
(designed for hooking into PCs or portable CD/MP3 players), or the really
high end (where the speakers cost $5,000 to $10,000 each).
Setting Up Surround Sound
Whew. You still with us? Well, if you are, the worst is behind you. Now you
can apply all this newfound knowledge to a discussion of your surround
sound system. In this section, we talk about the different speakers found in
any home theater system — the center channel speaker, the left and right
front speakers, the surround channel speakers, and the subwoofer. (To see
what a surround sound setup looks like, see Figure 12-1.)

Center speakers
We start with the center speaker. On the one hand, the center speaker is
probably the most important speaker in your system; on the other hand, 
it’s (supposedly) optional. How can that be, you ask?
Well, many people say the center speaker is optional because the left and
right speakers can handle the sound that comes from the center speaker.
However, we think that you miss out on a lot, and we don’t recommend 
this setup at all. The front center speaker, we feel, is critical and not at all
optional, but some budget crunchers will try to convince you that it is.
Now, why is it critical? Ah, our favorite subject. The center speaker anchors
your on-screen dialog and serves as a seamless connection between your left
and right speakers. As that boat zooms by from left to right, you don’t want
to have a gap in the middle of your sound field (a concern as screens get
larger and larger). Center speakers are usually located behind the screen or
above or below displays so that you can localize the on-screen sound as
much as possible.
To achieve this seamless harmony with the left and right front speakers, your
choice of center speaker is important. Don’t skimp on the center speaker in
favor of your other front speakers. Each speaker (left, center, and right) is
equally important and should be of similar size, similar capability, and prefer-
ably come from the same manufacturer. In fact, if you can use an identical
model speaker for the center, left, and right speakers (we talk about them in
just a second), do it. Many folks can’t do this because they’ve chosen tower
speakers for their left and right speakers, and can’t possibly install a tower
speaker on top of their display as a center channel speaker. (And if you’re not
using dipole or bipole speakers for your surround channels, you should con-
sider using another identical pair of speakers for your surrounds as well.)
Make sure any speakers that will be close to a cathode ray tube (direct-view)
video display are video shielded — especially the center speaker. If not, the
speakers will cause video distortion on your screen. This is most important
for your center speaker (which may rest directly on top of your display), but
can also be an issue for your left and right speakers if they are close to the
display as well.
Left and right speakers
We’ve cheated somewhat by talking a lot about the front left and right speak-
ers already in this chapter. If possible, these speakers should be
173
Chapter 12: Speaker of the House

 Full-range speakers: Yes, even if you plan on using a subwoofer.
 Ear-level: We’d recommend this level even for your bookshelf-style
speakers. If the speakers are large, try to arrange it so that the tweeters
are at ear level.
 Of similar performance capability as the center speaker: We’d even
say they should come from the same manufacturer.
We talk in Chapter 2 about whether you can use your existing speakers with
your home theater, and the bottom line is that if you do, try to buy a center
speaker from the same manufacturer and class for the best results.
In an ideal world, you use exactly the same model of speaker for your center,
left, and right speakers — all your front speakers. This isn’t always practical,
but we highly recommend you buy all three of these speakers from the same
manufacturer and make sure that the manufacturer has designed them to be
timbre matched — in other words, that they sound alike. This ensures that
you get a more seamless listening experience.
Surround speakers
No matter what the setup of your speakers for surround sound — whether
you have two, three, four, or more side and back speakers — your surround
speakers play a fundamentally different role than your front speakers. You
want things highly localized in the front part of your sound field, but the sur-
round field is more diffuse.
Now we can get back to the bipole/dipole speakers we discuss earlier in 
the chapter. Recall that the purpose of the center speaker is to provide 
highly localized speaker information; it’s coming from the center of the
screen. There’s a high correlation between what you see on the screen 
and where the sound comes from.
And likewise, the left and right speakers are to provide more lateral, but still
highly localized and directed, sound. Together, the three represent the frontal
face of your home theater sound experience. When there is a specific sound —
the clash of swords, the shout of the main character, the click of a trigger
being pulled back — the sound comes predominantly from these speakers.
The surround speakers have almost the opposite duty. Although you will
hear discrete sounds from your surround speakers, their main duty is to
create the sense of environment, the background, the unobvious. So if there
is a howling wind, the pitter-patter of a rainstorm, or the background of a
busy city, it comes from these speakers.
174
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Reviewers tend to talk about the diffuse sound of the surround sound speak-
ers because they often are not really making any specific sound per se, but a
cacophony of sounds that together create an atmosphere. And where the
front speakers (the center, left, and right) are arrayed at or around your ear
level, the surround sounds tend to work higher, to the sides, and behind you,
enveloping you in the surround sound field.
Surround sounds tend to rely less on direct radiated sound and more on
reflected and indirect sound. Just like in a city where sounds bounce off
buildings, or in a stadium where it’s sometimes hard to localize a specific
noise.
Bipole and dipole speakers, mounted on the sides of your room with front
and rear facing drivers, contribute to this diffuse and reflected sound. Dipole
speakers tend to be preferred for home theater applications because, relative
to bipole speakers, they bleed out less sound to the sides and therefore are
better at nonlocalized sounds. In comparison, bipole speakers tend to have
more sound seep out from the sides, which makes them less diffuse.
Recall from Chapter 3 that there are several different modes of surround
sound, often dependent on the encoding of your source input. There is a fair
amount of debate about the appropriate speaker to use to create surround
sound. For instance, Dolby Pro Logic encoders have a monophonic surround
channel with a limited range of frequencies supported; by comparison, Dolby
Digital encoders plan for full-range speakers. So do you use full-range speak-
ers that are more directional, in order to take advantage of the newly enabled
signals of Dolby Digital? Or, do you use more diffuse speakers to add to the
shared atmosphere of the “surround”?
The choice isn’t clear-cut. In general, we advise you to focus on creating a
broad, diffuse sound field to the sides, back, and top of the room. A good
installation uses dipole speakers to help provide localization where needed.
For the higher-end encoding, such as THX Surround or DTS-ES, where there
are at least four surround sound speakers, we suggest four dipole speakers —
two on the sides and two in the back. You set up your two back surround
speakers so that their drivers are in phase with one another. This maximizes
the ability to create a specific sound image right behind you and serves as a
good solution for home theater surround sound issues.
Some folks (typically on the high end of the home theater spectrum) recom-
mend using direct radiating speakers for your surrounds. (In fact, DTS recom-
mends this for DVDs encoded with their surround sound system.) We think
that, for most people, dipoles are a better bet, mainly because, for most films,
audio engineers mix the sound specifically for the diffuse speaker arrays
used in theaters. So the majority of DVDs have been designed specifically for
dipole-style speakers for your surrounds.

Subwoofers in the mix
Most subwoofers have floor-based enclosures with active speaker systems
(that is, with built-in amplifiers) for driving the low bass frequency ranges.
Your biggest decision comes in bass management. That is, how do you want
the bass signals in your system to be handled? You have a couple of options:
 The subwoofer can complement your full-range front speakers, provid-
ing for an even fuller bass signal.
 The subwoofer can handle all the bass, giving your front speakers the
ability to focus on the mid- and high-range frequencies.
Most home theater experts will advise you to move all bass to the subwoofer.
This results in more power and attention to the mid- and high-frequency dri-
vers and less strain on the amplifier and speaker systems. This setup also
gives you a more dynamic range, because the bass can go lower than most
full-range speaker woofers can themselves (hence the term subwoofer).
176
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Going virtual
In a perfect world, we’d all have room in our
home theaters for eight separate speakers
(including the subwoofer), and we’d have all of
our speaker cables neatly hidden inside the
walls. In other words, we’d have a butt-kicking
but aesthetically pleasing 7.1-channel surround
sound system.
Sometimes, however, reality intrudes upon our
perfect home theater world. Some folks just don’t
have the room for a full surround sound setup, or
they have issues with the layout or construction
of their room that keeps them from installing the
full complement of surround speakers.
Many folks in this predicament are forced to
stick with two-channel (stereo) audio and thus
forgo surround sound. There is an alternative
though — several manufacturers produce vir-
tual surround sound speaker systems that
incorporate multiple speaker drivers and some
fancy electronics in a single speaker unit, which
you place in the front of the room (usually right
above or below your display).
These virtual systems use a combination of phys-
ical “aiming” and electronic trickery to introduce
timing delays in the sound coming out of the
speakers’ drivers, which makes the sound
“bounce” off your walls in a coordinated fashion.
The result — while typically not as “immersive”
as a full set of surround speakers — can come a
lot closer to real surround sound than a pair of
stereo speakers.
One example of these virtual systems is
Yamaha’s YSP-800. (It runs about $800 at most
on-line retailers.) This system replaces not only
all of your speakers, but also takes over the job
of the A/V receiver. Connect your audio and
video sources (like a DVD player) into the back
of the YSP-800, plug it into the wall, and (with a
little setup) you have convincing surround
sound from a single speaker. It’s a great setup
for a quick and easy surround system for a
smaller room or an apartment home theater.

If you have a modern A/V receiver, you use a standard line-level audio inter-
connect cable to connect your subwoofer to the receiver. (We talk about these
cables in Chapter 16.) If you’re using an older receiver as a stopgap until you
purchase that nice new Dolby Digital A/V receiver, look for a subwoofer that
also accepts speaker level connections. These connections enable you to run
the speaker wires from your receiver to the subwoofer and then on to your
front right and left speakers. In this case, there’s no direct connection between
your receiver and your front speakers — your front speaker outputs on the
receiver are connected directly into the subwoofer, which is then connected
with another set of speaker cables to the front speakers themselves. This type
of connection isn’t as good as a line level one, but it works.
Many subwoofers come with an Auto On/Off function that turns the active
subwoofer’s amplifier on and off with the presence of a signal. So the ampli-
fier turns itself on when you’re playing music or a movie soundtrack and then
off again a few minutes after you’re done. Pretty handy.
Recall that the subwoofer is usually powered by its own amplifier. As such, it
has a volume control and a phase adjustment switch. You adjust the volume
when fine-tuning your system and pretty much leave it at that setting. Your
phase adjustment switch is sometimes a +/–180 degree switch and sometimes
a continuously variable switch from 0 to +/–180 degrees (preferable). This
comes into play when trying to fine-tune your system vis-à-vis your front left
and right speakers. You adjust this so that the sound coming from each is rel-
atively in alignment, despite the fact that the subwoofer and front speakers
may be located at different distances from the listeners. By adjusting the
phase, you can move the timing of the sound coming from the subwoofer.
In Chapter 21, we explain how to link your bass with transducers to provide a
truly ground-shaking home theater experience.

Getting heady(phones) at home
You will see advertisements for surround sound
headphones. Hopefully, you’ve understood
enough in this chapter to say, “How can you
cram five speakers and a subwoofer into a set of
two-speaker headphones?” Hey, good question!
It’s simple. No matter how many speakers you
use in your system, you are still listening with two
ears. These “surround sound” headphones basi-
cally try to reproduce what is arriving at your
ears by using digital signal processors (DSPs).
Dolby has gone one step further with a Dolby
Headphone encoder (www.dolby.com/
dolbyheadphone) that can be built right into
a receiver and that simulates Dolby Digital 5.1
over the two headphone channels. With Dolby
Headphone, you don’t use special headphones —
any old pair of high-quality headphones will do
the trick. Pretty cool, if you ask us.
If you plan on using headphones a lot (perhaps
because your spouse does not like the movies
you watch, eh, Pat?), check whether your
receiver supports Dolby Headphone.

W
e spend a lot of time in this part of the book talking about the audio sys-
tems that envelop you in surround sound and aurally immerse you in a
movie. But let’s face facts — we call it watching a movie because that’s what we
do. The audio creates the ambience, but the display is what you focus on. So
choosing a high-quality video system that can properly display the content you
want to watch — whether that content comes from traditional broadcast/
cable/satellite TV, from DVD, or even from HDTV — is essential.
In this chapter, we talk about the lingo of the TV world as our way of helping
you make sense of all the terms and jargon you hear when you’re shopping
for a new display. We also talk about what it means for a display to be consid-
ered an HDTV (or high-definition TV) — which, by the way, we highly recom-
mend you choose for your home theater. Finally, we discuss the different
types of displays you can run into in a home theater and give you the low-
down on each type.
In Chapter 14, we talk in depth about each of the major categories of home
theater displays, discussing the pros and cons of each type. So, if you already
have a good feeling for what a comb filter does, for example, as well as the dif-
ference between an HDTV and an HDTV monitor, you probably don’t need to
linger here. Go ahead and skip right to Chapter 14 to get to the nitty-gritty —
our recommendations on what type of TV to buy.

180
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Learning the Lingo
If you’re shopping for a TV for your home theater, you’re probably going to
run into salespeople, Web sites, and brochures full of acronyms and unfamil-
iar terms. Unfortunately, the technology industry tends to market its prod-
ucts with a list of features that are designed to bludgeon you upside the head
and leave you with glassy eyes and a maxed-out credit card in your hand.
We’re here to help. The following sections cover some of the most significant
features and performance stats that you’ll hear as you shop, and, more
importantly, we explain what they mean!
Screen size
We won’t insult your intelligence by telling you what screen size means, but
we will tell you how it’s measured. With a single exception (screens for front-
projector systems), displays are measured diagonally. This is important to
keep in mind because 16:9 and 4:3 screen sizes can’t be directly compared
diagonally — it’s an apples and oranges thing. For example, a 16:9 32-inch
screen is about 28 inches wide and a bit less than 16 inches high, while a 4:3
32-inch screen is 25.6 inches wide and a hair over 19 inches high.
Before you buy any television, you need to consider the size of your room
and your expected seating distance from the display. As a gut reaction, most
people think bigger is better when it comes to TV, but in fact, that’s not really
the case. Just as a TV can be obviously too small for a room (try sitting 15
feet back from a 27-inch TV), the opposite can be equally true. (Yes, Virginia,
a TV can in fact be too darn big for a room.) And we’re not just talking about
being physically too big to fit in the room (or to look acceptable to your
spouse, décor-wise), but also being visually too big.
Every video display has some sort of line structure (or in the case of flat-
panel displays, pixel structure). The picture you see on your screen is made
up of a series of individual points of light. Generally speaking, the bigger the
screen, the bigger these individual points are. When you sit back a reason-
able distance, your eyes can’t discern these individual items, but if you get
too close, they can. (Don’t believe us? Turn on any TV in your house and
walk right up to it. Take a look. See?)
Because line or pixel size depends on the size of the screen, the distance at
which you can make out this structure varies by screen size. (The number 
of lines or pixels being displayed plays a part, too, which makes this effect

slightly less noticeable on HDTVs that fit 720 or more vertically measured
lines on the screen, instead of 480.)
Generally, we recommend that you sit two and a half screen size measurements
from an HDTV-capable display and three screen sizes away from a non-HDTV.
Note that we said you can sit closer to an HDTV than you can to a traditional
TV simply because there are more lines and pixels on the screen (which makes
them smaller and harder to see individually). The real goal of these measure-
ments is to make sure that, for any particular viewing distance, your screen is
close enough to give you a truly immersive “big screen” experience without
being so big that you can make out the individual elements that make up the
picture.
Lots of folks just want a gigantic TV. Nothing wrong with that in our minds, but
do pay a little attention to these formulas so you don’t end up with a screen
so big that you can make out the individual pixels and lines — it makes the
picture much less realistic, and it can really be kind of annoying. Certain types
of displays, such as LCD (liquid crystal display) flat panels and LCD projection
TVs, have pixels with physical characteristics that make them even more
noticeable when you’re close up — keep this in mind when you’re choosing a
display.
You can turn this equation around (ah, the wonders of math, huh?). If you
have a good idea of how big your home theater room is going to be (we bet
that you do) and also how far your primary seating area is going to be from
the screen, you can use these guidelines to determine how big a display you
need. If you’re going for a widescreen HDTV, measure the distance to your
seating area and divide by 2.5 — then multiply this number by 12 to deter-
mine your optimal screen size in inches (measured diagonally). Substitute 
a 3 for the 2.5 if you’re going with an old-fashioned non-HDTV set.
Some of the newest high-definition TVs — fully capable of 1080p display reso-
lutions, meaning they can show up to 1,080 lines running across the screen,
as opposed to the 720 that most HDTVs are capable of — can be comfortably
viewed at even closer distances than the 720p HDTVs. So if you want a huge
screen (relative to your viewing distance), you might want to choose one of
these displays. You’re much less likely to see the individual picture elements
with these displays, even if you’re considerably closer than 2.5 times the
screen size.
Table 13-1 is a rough guideline for screen size versus distance from the
screen. Keep in mind that you don’t have to be exact here — these are 
guidelines. If you want to go up or down a screen size from these recom-
mendations, feel free — it shouldn’t cause you any real viewing issues.

Aspect ratio
We already let the cat out of the bag on this subject (several times through-
out the book), but let’s repeat it because it’s important — displays can be
shaped for widescreen material (16:9) or for traditional TV viewing (4:3).
Although you can still find plenty of 4:3 displays on the market, for home the-
ater purposes, we think you need to go with a widescreen (16:9) display —
that’s the right aspect ratio for DVDs, high-definition TV programming, and
even many video games. If you’re just buying a TV for the kitchen or guest
bedroom, you might choose to go with 4:3, but for theater viewing, you really
need to go widescreen.
In the past, we recommended that folks buying CRT (tube) TVs consider a 
4:3 aspect ratio, as long as the TV could be optimized (the beam “re-aimed” 
in other words) for 16:9. That recommendation was mainly because there
weren’t a lot of widescreen tube TVs on the market. But these days, a 
number of manufacturers sell widescreen tube TVs.
Picture adjustability
Any display allows you to adjust the specific settings for your picture (and
this is something we highly recommend you do). To do so, you typically use
an on-screen display and your remote control.
182
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Most people think of these settings as something to do once and never change.
In fact, different environments might call for different settings. You might have
one setting for the darkened-room home theater environment and another set-
ting (that deals with ambient light better) for the brightly lit Super Bowl party.
Some systems let you save these settings as presets so that you can quickly
access a certain group of settings without having to manually readjust every
setting each time you want to re-create your settings. It’s nice to be able to
press a few quick buttons and get things back to the optimal movie-watching
settings without readjusting your picture manually.
We recommend that you choose a display that lets you set the picture sepa-
rately for each input or source device. That way, you can customize your set-
tings individually — one setting for the HDTV cable box on your HDMI input,
for example, and another for the DVD player and other devices coming into
one of your display’s component video inputs from your A/V receiver. We talk
more about these settings in Chapter 20.
Connections on the back
When you get down to the business of connecting your A/V gear to your dis-
play, you need to make sure that your display has the right inputs to connect
the source devices that will feed video into your home theater. Keep in mind
that most video source devices have multiple types of video outputs, and
that you can get the best picture quality if you use the right connection meth-
ods. So when you evaluate displays, remember that it’s not just the number of
inputs that’s important, but rather the type. In fact, we’d argue in most cases
that type is more important than the number of inputs.
We recommend that you connect most or all of your source devices directly
to your A/V receiver, not your display, to simplify both hook-up and opera-
tion. So it’s typically not all that important to have, for example, four different
S-video inputs on the back of your TV. You’ll connect all of your S-video
sources directly to your receiver and will need only a single S-video cable
connecting the receiver to your TV.
You should make sure that your display has at least one of each of the follow-
ing types of inputs (check out Figure 13-1; we discuss these inputs in detail in
Chapter 16):
 Composite video
 S-Video (Just like in the comic books, “S” here stands for Super, as in
Super-Video)
183
Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options

 Component video
 HDMI — short for High-Definition Multimedia Interface
You should also expect to have a pair of analog audio inputs for each of these
inputs (except for HDMI, which carries the audio on the same cable as it car-
ries the video, which is very handy!).
You may also find the following inputs on your display:
 DVI — Okay, it’s really Digital Video Interface, which can be used for PC
connections
 VGA (the old standby, Video Graphics Array, used, like DVI, for connec-
tions to a PC)
 FireWire (not common, but found on a few brands of HDTVs)
While we find that having multiple numbers of each of these connection
types can be a bit of overkill if you’re connecting your sources through the
receiver (as we recommend), there are some situations in which you’ll be
very happy to have multiples of certain types of inputs:
 Component video: If your A/V receiver can’t handle high-definition sig-
nals through its component video inputs (almost all new home theater
receivers can, but many older models can only handle DVD and not
HDTV), you’ll want to have at least two sets of component video inputs
on your display.
 HDMI: HDMI, as we discuss in Chapter 16, is rapidly becoming the
method for connecting source components to high-definition TVs. Most
A/V receivers don’t have HDMI video switching capabilities (see Chapter
11 to learn more about video switching), and many that do can accept
only a couple of HDMI inputs.

184
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

We highly recommend that if you’re buying a new display, you choose one
that has two HDMI inputs, just to increase your options and give you some
more flexibility when you add new components like an HD-DVD or Blu-ray
disc player to your home theater.
If you don’t have enough HDMI inputs on your TV, you can always add an
external HDMI video switch, as we discuss in Chapter 21.
Connections on the front
If you own a camcorder or some other portable video source device (such as a
laptop computer that you may wish to occasionally connect to your home the-
ater display), you may want to choose a display with a set of A/V connectors
on the front of the unit. It’s a lot easier to make quick, temporary connections
this way than it is to try to climb behind your display and hook things up.
Look for a display that has at least one set of analog audio and video (prefer-
ably both composite and S-Video) connections on the front. Note that many
flat-panel TVs, as well as the thinner microdisplay rear-projection models,
hide these inputs on the side or even bottom (for wall mounted displays) of
the TV.
Monitor versus television
When a display comes with a built-in TV tuner (so you can plug in an antenna
or a cable connection and immediately watch TV), we call it a television.
Some displays — for example, many projectors and plasma displays — come
without any built-in TV tuning capabilities; we call these displays monitors or
HD-ready displays. In fact, some monitors don’t have a built-in audio speaker,
so they don’t offer even a minimal audio capacity. (We don’t think this is a
huge deal because any home theater worth its salt already has a good audio
system, but for casual viewing, like watching the news, you may not want to
fire up your audio system.)
Contrast ratio
If you look at TVs on a showroom floor, you might not ever realize this
(because the displays have their brightness cranked up), but displays should
be capable of showing both dark and light scenes. For example, you want to
be able to see the flash of the artillery in Saving Private Ryan as well as the
soldiers seeking cover in the shadows.
185
Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options

There’s a measurement for how well a display can show both bright brights
and nuanced darks: contrast ratio. You’ll see this as a numeric ratio, some-
thing like 1000:1, representing the whitest white compared to the blackest
black. Typically, direct-view (tube) displays and projector systems that use
CRTs have the highest contrast ratios, whereas systems that use plasma or
LCD technologies have the lowest. When it comes to contrast ratio, a higher
ratio is better.
There isn’t a standardized, approved way of measuring contrast ratios, so
one manufacturer’s 800:1 may not be the same as another’s. You need to rely
on magazine and on-line reviews and use your own eyes in a thorough test
drive at a dealer’s showroom. We like reviews that include a professional cali-
bration of the display because that shows the display’s true “ultimate” capa-
bilities. When you do a test drive, use some of your own DVDs that you know
well.
Comb filter
Many video sources (such as broadcast NTSC television or composite video
connections from other source devices) send both the color (chrominance)
and brightness (luminance) parts of the video signal as a single, combined (or
composite) signal. Inside the TV, either a notch filter or a comb filter separates
these signals into their component parts. If signals aren’t properly separated,
you see moving dots of color around the edges of images, a phenomenon
called dot crawl.
Notch filters are the least effective at this process, whereas the various kinds
of comb filters do a better job. You’ll find three kinds of comb filters in direct-
view displays:
 2-D comb filter: This is the least effective (and least expensive) kind of
comb filter, though it is better than a notch filter.
 3-D comb filter: We’re talking middle ground here — better than 2-D, but
not as good as the digital comb filter.
 Digital comb filter (sometimes called 3-D Y/C): Found in more expen-
sive direct-view sets, the digital comb filter uses more sophisticated
(and digital!) signal processing to separate chrominance and luminance.
This is the king of the hill when it comes to comb filters.
When you connect sources to your display with S-Video or component video
cables (discussed in Chapter 16), chrominance and luminance are separated
in the source device, not in your TV. In this case, your display’s built-in comb
filter is bypassed.
186
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Resolution
As we discuss in Chapter 4, display resolution is a measure of how precise and
sharp a picture a display can create. For standard-definition programming —
such as NTSC television and, to a degree, DVD — this isn’t a really huge deal.
(Any display can handle the 480 vertical lines of resolution of these formats —
which is not to say they’ll all look the same!) As you start getting into HDTV
sources (and even widescreen “anamorphic” DVDs), however, resolution
becomes a really big deal.
Generally, display vendors spend most of their time talking about the vertical
resolution of their sets, which corresponds to the most commonly discussed
resolutions of HDTV, 720 and 1080. Some displays (particularly those that
have a fixed-pixel system, such as LCD or plasma) give resolution in terms 
of both horizontal and vertical numbers (similar to the way resolutions are
discussed in the computer display world). So you might see, for example, 
a plasma display with a resolution of 1280 x 720p (which corresponds to
720p). In this case, the 1280 refers to the horizontal resolution (the number 
of pixels, or individual points, across the screen) and 720 refers to the verti-
cal number (like the scan lines on a conventional TV).
As we mention in Chapter 4, displays are also classified by the input resolu-
tions that they can handle. These input resolutions simply are the resolutions
that the display can accept from source devices. The circuitry inside the dis-
play itself converts (if necessary) these signals to the display’s own native
display resolution. Read the fine print closely — some displays (the EDTVs
we talk about in Chapter 4, for example) can accept high-definition resolu-
tions like 720p, but they display it at a lower (not high-definition) resolution.
When you get into high-definition digital displays, you’ll find out that your dis-
play holds some circuitry that handles this conversion from input resolution to
display resolution. This circuitry is known as the scaler because it scales the
image from one size to another. When you’re reading reviews of different dis-
plays you are considering, pay close attention to the capabilities of this scaler;
it will manipulate most of the video signals you send into your TV. (There
aren’t necessarily going to be any hard, cold, objective numbers to describe
scaler performance, but instead the reviews will talk about the absence of
“jagged lines” and other visible picture distortions for scaled images.) All else
being equal, a display with a better scaler will have a better picture, especially
when it displays video sources that aren’t created in the display’s native dis-
play resolution.
Interlaced and progressive scan
In Chapter 4 (it’s a chapter you shouldn’t skip!), we talk about the two 
scanning methods that video displays use — interlaced and progressive.
Traditional TV systems (such as NTSC, the standard TV system in the 
187
Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options

United States) use an interlaced scan, where half the picture appears on the
screen at a time. The other half follows an instant later (1⁄60th of a second, to be
precise). The interlaced system relies on the fact that your eyes can’t really
detect this procedure in action — at least not explicitly. In a progressive-
scan system, the entire picture is painted at once, which greatly reduces the
flickering that people notice when watching TV. Progressive scan is available
throughout the range of TV types we’re about to discuss. We highly recom-
mend progressive scan if it fits into your budget because the picture appears
much smoother and more like a film. (You can get direct-view progressive-
scan TVs for under $500 these days.)
Any HDTV display can handle progressive scan.
Scan frequency
Scan frequency is something you might not hear much about unless you’re
buying an HDTV or a high-end projector system, but if you’re shopping in the
higher end of the market, you should know what scan frequency is. In general
terms, scan frequency (which is measured in kHz — thousands of cycles per
second) is directly related to the interlaced and progressive-scan types that we
discuss in the preceding section. Standard NTSC video, which is interlaced,
puts out 15,734 scan lines per second. 15.75 kHz is the common rounded ver-
sion of this number. When you start getting into progressive-scan video (using,
for example, a progressive-scan DVD player), you effectively double this scan
frequency to 31.5 kHz. HDTV systems can go even higher. If you’re looking into
CRT projector systems (which we discuss in the following chapter), you’ll hear
a lot about scan frequencies.
If you’re choosing a digital display (LCD, plasma, or DLP [Digital Light
Processor]), you will probably never run into any mention of scan frequency.
This is something that really only comes into play for CRT projections (and, to
a lesser extent, direct-view CRT displays). For the most part, you won’t have
to worry about scan frequency unless you are buying one of these displays.
Getting Equipped for HDTV
Before we start talking about the physical differences between the various
categories of displays (differences such as picture tube or no picture tube),
we want to cover one even higher-level distinction. That distinction is the 
following: Is the display capable of playing back HDTV at full resolution?
188
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

We talk a lot about what HDTV is in Chapter 4, including the fact that next-
generation digital TV (also called ATSC) has a bunch of different formats. 
Two of those formats, 1080i and 720p, qualify as high-definition television, 
or HDTV.
Deciding on HDTV or a traditional NTSC TV is probably the most important
decision you can make if you’re buying a new display unit for your home the-
ater, but we think home theater shoppers won’t need to agonize over this
decision any longer. That’s because we think almost all displays that are
appropriate for home theaters should be capable of displaying HDTV. At the
very least, we feel that moving up to HDTV capabilities won’t be much of a
price jump. If you can afford it today (and you can get HDTV-ready sets for
under $1,000), we highly recommend that you get an HDTV or HDTV-ready
display now.
You can buy an HDTV for well under $1,000 these days, so unless your 
budget is quite tight, we really think you should make an HDTV-capable dis-
play the centerpiece of your home theater. With HDTV programming becom-
ing commonplace (see Chapter 7), and HDTV discs also hitting the market
(see Chapter 6), there’s plenty of great HDTV content to watch on your big
screen. So if you can swing it, we urge you to go the HDTV route!
We talk about HDTV back in Chapter 4. Now, we want to talk about the charac-
teristics of TVs and displays that can play back HDTV programming. The first
layer of the HDTV onion that we should peel back is the concept of an HDTV
versus an HDTV-ready system. An HDTV has the following key characteristics:
 Resolution: Can display true high-definition signals with at least 720
lines of horizontal resolution (in other words, 720 lines of picture data
stacked on top of each other vertically on the screen).
The latest and greatest HDTVs can display the full 1920 x 1080 pixels of
1080i HDTV signals (and do so in a progressive scan fashion). Such
HDTVs are often called 1080p HDTVs.
 Aspect ratio: Has a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9.
 Tuner: Has a built-in TV tuner, which is capable of decoding any over-
the-air broadcast format within the ATSC digital television standard.
(HDTVs that get their HDTV programming from an internal DSS receiver
are also called HDTVs, even though they don’t strictly fit this definition.)
An HDTV-ready set, often called an HDTV monitor, must meet only the first
two requirements. Many direct-view (tube) HDTV-ready sets meet the second
requirement only because of an “anamorphic squeeze” mode (discussed in
Chapter 14), not because the sets are physically shaped in the 16:9 aspect
ratio.
189
Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options

All four types of displays we discuss in this book — direct-view, flat-panel,
front-projection, and rear-projection systems — can be built as an HDTV or
HDTV-ready system. And just like non-HDTV versions of these displays, a
huge range of sizes and shapes is on the market. You can buy a 14-inch LCD
(liquid crystal display — which we talk about in depth in Chapter 14) HDTV
for a bedroom or kitchen, or you can buy a $30,000 HDTV-ready projector
that requires professional mounting and calibration and gives you an HDTV
picture the size of some movie theater screens. You can find a vast range of
options in the HDTV world.

Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Will my HDTV work next year?
Seems impossible to even consider, doesn’t it?
HDTV is the newest thing around, just barely on
the market, and already we’re asking a question
like this? Well, although it would take a degree
of contempt for (or ignorance of) the customer,
which we don’t think the HDTV industry will let
happen, it is possible that some buyers of HDTV
technology may find their sets unable to con-
nect in the not-so-distant future.
The issue is copy protection. Many movie and TV
studios want to have some control over your abil-
ity to make copies of digital content sent to your
HDTV (not all, to be fair — a few actually support
technologies like the D-VHS we discuss in
Chapter 6). So a new type of connection tech-
nology called HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia
Interface), which supports a copy-protection
system called HDCP (High Definition Content
Protection), has been developed for HDTV-ready
TVs, set-top boxes, and HDTV tuners. Not every
HDTV comes with an HDMI interface. If you don’t
have HDMI (or it’s older cousin DVI, which also
supports HDCP) on your HDTV, you’ll connect to
your HDTV sources with analog component
video cables (in the vast majority of cases).
There’s nothing wrong with component video,
but the TV and movie industries don’t like analog
connections because they can’t easily apply
their copy protection systems to these connec-
tions like they can to digital connections like
HDMI. So there exists a possibility that in the
future, HDTV sources will only be displayed in
their full resolution when using a digital (HDMI)
connection and will be converted down to a
lower resolution when sent over analog cables.
Could happen. Probably won’t. But we wanted
to mention it as something to think about before
you make an investment in HDTV. Keep in mind
that this issue (not having an HDCP-enabled
HDMI or DVI connection on your HDTV-ready
display) won’t keep you from using any HDTV
tuner you buy along with the display (or the
built-in tuner if you buy a true HDTV). It’ll just
keep you from having all the flexibility you might
want. We highly recommend getting a unit with
HDMI connections (even though we’re not all
that keen on the concept of HDCP).
(By the way, the FireWire digital connection
system can also support copy protection and
should provide you with a safe investment as
well, but not too many display vendors have
chosen to put FireWire on their displays.)

As we discuss the different types of displays in this chapter (and in the fol-
lowing chapter when we discuss projectors), we talk about the strengths and
weaknesses of each type of display in overall terms (HDTV, NTSC, DVD play-
back, you name it — when we say overall, we mean overall). Remember that
any of these systems can be used for HDTV (of course, not every or even
most models within these groups can display HDTV signals). We mention 
any special HDTV considerations as we discuss each type of display.
Choosing a TV
As you shop for a display, you’ll find that, beyond all the brand and size
choices, you need to make some high-level decisions about what kind of dis-
play you want. For many people, a display (or TV) means the traditional tube
television that’s been around for decades, but new technologies have made
flat-panel screens (which have no tube and are only a few inches deep) into a
viable choice as well — and projection TVs (which shoot the picture onto a
screen) have never been better, cheaper, or bigger. In this section, we give
you an overview of the primary technologies that underlie different types of
TVs. (In the following chapter, we talk about each of these TV types in depth,
so you can understand the pros and cons of each type.)
The first distinction to be made in the world of home theater displays
revolves around how the picture gets to your eyeballs.
 With some displays, you are directly viewing the image created by the
imaging hardware within the TV. In other words, the image is created on
the screen you are watching. These displays are known as direct view.
The most common type of direct-view display is the old-fashioned “tube”
TV, but flat-panel (hang-on-the-wall) plasma and LCD TVs can also be con-
sidered direct-view displays.
 Other displays create the image in one place and then project it onto a
screen elsewhere. These projector displays work much like a movie pro-
jector in a theater (and better than that noisy one in your third-grade
social studies class) and can offer the biggest image size of any type of
display. There are two types of projectors:
• Rear-projection systems, which display an image on the back of the
screen, which you then view from the front.
• Front-projection systems, which display an image on the front of a
screen (the same side you view the image on).
191
Chapter 13: Understanding Your Display Options

Beyond this initial categorization, displays are also categorized by the under-
lying technology that creates the image. There are a few dominant technolo-
gies here. Note that most of these technologies can be used for either
direct-view or projection displays, depending on how they are implemented.
 CRT: CRT, or cathode ray tube, is the traditional technology behind TVs
and home theater displays (for a long time, the only technology, but that
has changed a lot in the past ten years). CRTs can be used in both
direct-view and projector applications.
 Plasma: Plasma (sometimes called PDP, or plasma display panel) displays
use a grid of electrical circuits sandwiched between two plates of glass to
electrically excite a gas and cause it to put out light. Plasma displays are
the thin (often less than 4 inches thick) TVs that everyone’s dying to
hang on their walls.
 LCD: LCDs do exactly what their name implies — they have liquid crys-
tal particles within them that can be aligned in different ways to create
different colors. When a bright light shines through these crystals, you
get a video picture. LCDs can be flat-panel TVs (like a plasma display),
or they can be used in projection TVs (see the bullet on microdisplays
below). If you’ve seen a laptop computer (or a desktop PC with a flat-
panel display), you’ve seen an LCD.
 Microdisplays: Traditionally, projection systems used CRT tubes to create
the projected image. Most current projection systems use a microdisplay
technology to do so instead. A microdisplay is exactly what the name says
it is — basically a tiny display that uses some sort of miniaturized display
technology to create an image that is then enlarged when it is beamed
onto the projection screen. There are several different technologies within
the microdisplay family:
• LCD: The same LCD technology used for flat-panel screens can be
shrunken down and used within a projector.
• DLP: A DLP, or digital light processor, uses a special video chip from
Texas Instruments that includes millions of microscopic mirrors
that are moved by computer command (sort of like the Robot in
Lost in Space, only smaller!) to create an image.
• LCoS: Liquid Crystal on Silicon microdisplays use a special variant
of LCD technology that’s shrunken down to the chip level.
As we mentioned, some of these technologies can be used in either direct-
view or projection applications (CRT and LCD in particular), which can make
things a bit confusing for the casual shopper. If you’re shopping on-line (or
just comparing prices), and you don’t actually see the TV in front of you, make
sure you read all of the details. We’d hate for you to think you were getting an
LCD flat panel to hang on the wall when you were actually pricing out an LCD
front-projection system that goes on the ceiling and needs a separate screen!

C
hoosing the right display for your home theater is one of the most
important tasks you’ll face when you begin building your home theater.
Your display is the most visible (no pun intended) part of your home theater,
and a great high-definition widescreen picture can really knock folks’ socks
off. So choose the right display for your particular home theater, and you’ll
be that much closer to the “being there” experience that you get at the
movies.
In Chapter 13, we talk about all of the things you should understand about
displays in general, including the features and capabilities to look for when
shopping for a new TV or display. Those discussions apply across all sorts 
of display types — you’ll want, for example, an HDMI input whether you are
buying a plasma or a DLP rear-projection unit.
In this chapter, we take the discussion to the next level by examining each of
the common types of displays you might choose for a home theater — CRT
“tube” TVs, plasma and LCD flat panels, and the whole array of front- and
rear-projection TVs — and give you some insight into the pros and cons of
each type. Combine this with the knowledge you gain by reading Chapter 13,
and you’ll be ready to start shopping!
Sticking with the Tried-and-True Tube
Admit it. You say it, too: “What’s on the tube?” C’mon, we all say it, and for
good reason — the vast majority of TVs are direct-view CRT (or cathode ray
tube) models. You know what they look like — kind of big and bulky, with a
big (and relatively heavy) glass tube inside.

194
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
The CRT itself is a vacuum tube (so don’t drop it — well, don’t drop any tele-
vision, if you can help it, especially not on your foot) with an electron gun 
at the back and a phosphor coating on the inside of the screen (the part you
look at). When a CRT operates, the electron gun shoots a beam of electrons
on that phosphor coating, as shown in Figure 14-1. In reaction to being bom-
barded by these electrons, the phosphor coating lights up. A color CRT 
actually has three electron guns — one each for red, green, and blue. This
combination of colors (often called RGB) can be combined on the screen 
to produce any color you want.
Because CRT TVs are an old technology, many people skip right past them as
they shop for a home theater display. We’re not entirely convinced that’s a
good idea. CRT TVs have a few significant things going for them:
 They’re cheap: Because the factories and machines and technologies
behind CRT are old (though constantly refined), CRTs are rather inex-
pensive to build (HDTV models are not nearly as cheap). This gets
passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices (capitalism at
work!), making CRT televisions the cheapest you can buy.
You can buy a 26-inch HDTV-ready CRT television for about $500 —
about as cheap as you’re likely to see in the near future for an HDTV-
ready display.
 They work well in a bright room: The contrast ratios and overall ability
to crank out the light are typically highest on CRT displays. If you can’t
create a dark environment for your home theater (something we think is
really important, but that we realize isn’t always possible), a direct-view
TV may be your best choice. Another reason to choose direct-view is
because you like to have your buddies over for the big game in the
middle of a bright day.

 They have excellent viewing angles: You can sit (or stand — we don’t
care how you watch your home theater system!) pretty well off the
“center axis” of a CRT and still see a good picture. There’s not a small
“sweet spot” centered around the perpendicular from your screen with 
a CRT (as there is with many projection TVs, for example).
 They’re better at black: Not only are CRTs brighter than other display
types, they’re also better at creating dark images than most other kinds
of displays. So if you like to watch a lot of film noir or anything that has
dark scenes (with people lurking in the shadows), you’ll appreciate the
fact that CRT displays let you see details that can be lost on other sets.
Like anything else, getting a CRT TV has some drawbacks. Whether these
drawbacks are enough to drive you to a different display type really depends
on how important the strengths we just listed are to you. Here’s what to keep
in mind as you make this decision:
 Limited size: Although CRTs are relatively easy and cheap to make, the
manufacturing process does become difficult when CRTs reach a certain
size. Huge vacuum tubes aren’t easy to create, and as the screen gets
bigger, keeping the electron guns properly aimed is also a big issue for
display designers. When you start looking at displays bigger than about
40 inches, you won’t find CRTs in your size range.
 Heavy and bulky: You certainly can’t hang a CRT on the wall (like you
can with the plasma displays we discuss in a moment). In fact, if you go
for a bigger screen size, you can’t even lift your CRT TV (CRTs bigger
than 36 inches often weigh over 200 pounds). And weight isn’t the only
issue — CRT sets usually have 2 or 3 feet of electronics and tube behind
the screen. So if you’re tight on space but desire a big screen, don’t be
surprised if a CRT doesn’t work for you.
 Lower resolution: For NTSC and DVD viewing, CRT displays (at least high-
quality models) can meet the resolution demands of the source material.
But when you start getting into HDTV sources, you’ll find that CRTs can’t
keep up. They can provide excellent pictures, but if you were to compare
them side by side with a plasma or projection TV, you’d find that most
direct-view HDTVs don’t match up, at least in terms of resolution.
If you have the money to spend (and it won’t be cheap), you can get many 
of the benefits of a direct-view TV, without the drawbacks, by investing in 
a CRT-based projection TV. We discuss such models later in this chapter.
If a tube TV fits into your budget, room, and lifestyle, there are a few things
you should look for. (As an aside, one of Pat’s college professors automati-
cally gave an F to anyone who used the word lifestyle in a paper, so he loves
to sprinkle it in his writing now.) Consider this a checklist of sorts, but keep
195
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

in mind that some TVs can have all these things and still not be all that great.
Others can be great even though they’re missing a feature or two. So the fol-
lowing items are recommended but not essential:
 Flat-screen: Older TVs had a curved screen surface (the actual front of
the screen that you watch), but many newer models have a truly flat
screen surface. (This is different than a flat-panel, where the whole dis-
play is flat and thin.) The biggest advantage of a flat-screen direct-view
TV is the fact that this screen is much less susceptible to reflections and
glare.
 Aspect ratio: For most display types, we only recommend a 16:9 aspect
ratio that is optimized for widescreen movie viewing. We also recom-
mend that you consider a widescreen model if you’re buying a tube TV,
but you may find that your budget works better with a 4:3 tube TV (the
widescreen models are typically a bit more expensive). If you do buy a
4:3 tube TV, be sure that it supports the anamorphic squeeze or 16:9
mode discussed in the next bullet, or you’ll suffer from a significant loss
of resolution when playing DVDs, HDTV, and other widescreen content.
 Anamorphic squeeze: Often called raster squeeze, this is a neat trick
that lets you watch anamorphic DVDs at full resolution on 4:3 aspect
ratio, direct-view TVs. (This isn’t a feature you find or need on fixed-
pixel displays, such as LCD or plasma.) The squeeze basically re-aims
the electron guns’ beams (the raster) to create a 16:9 window within the
4:3 screen. At first glance, this looks a lot like a letterboxed video picture
on your screen, but instead of wasting lines of resolution to draw black
bars, this refocused beam uses the entire 480 lines to create the video
you’re watching. The result is a sharper, brighter, and better-looking pic-
ture. Some displays have an automatic system for detecting 16:9 sources
and turning on this mode, and others have a button on the remote to
activate it.
If you use this mode, make sure you’ve set your DVD player to “think”
it’s connected to a 16:9 TV. Otherwise, you don’t get anything out of your
display’s anamorphic squeeze function.
The bottom line with tube TVs is this — they have a number of advantages
and a number of disadvantages. Most folks starting a new home theater today
will choose one of the newer (but more expensive) technologies we discuss
throughout the rest of the chapter. If you decide that you want a tube display,
act soon — many manufacturers are cutting back production and using this
technology only for the most inexpensive “throwaway” TVs that people put
in their guest bedrooms or garages. For example, as we were writing this
chapter, Sony announced that it was closing its huge Trinitron picture tube
factory in Pat’s neighborhood of San Diego. It’s starting to become the end of
an era for the tube TV.
196
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Thin Is In — Flat-panel TVs
The coolest development in the TV world in years and years has been the
advent of the flat-panel (notice we didn’t say flat-screen) display. These are
TVs that you can literally hang on the wall. Flat-panel TVs use technologies
such as LCD and plasma to create a TV that is barely bigger than the screen
itself. These displays have a small frame around the edges of the screen and
are about 3 or 4 inches deep. There are some tradeoffs to flat-panel displays,
but if you can live with them, you can definitely find a place in your home
theater for a flat-panel — literally!
197
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies
The replacement for the CRT?
As the era of the tube draws to a close, a new
and somewhat similar technology called SED
(surface-conduction electron-emitter display)
has begun to trickle out of the labs. Toshiba and
Canon are the two big proponents of this tech-
nology, which is in many ways a hybrid of the
CRT and the plasma display.
SED displays (none are in production as we
write, but we’ve seen demonstrations of some
hand-built prototypes) are designed to be thin
and flat, like a plasma TV, but at the same time
provide the bright picture and the deep, deep
blacks of a CRT. Essentially, an SED display
takes the electron gun of a CRT and turns it into
a big flat panel that sends the electrons across
a small vacuum to the phosphors on another flat
panel of glass. It looks like a plasma display
(because it’s thin and flat), but because it uses
electrons hitting a phosphor layer, it has all the
picture benefits of a CRT. (Plasma also uses
electrons, but the process involves exciting a
gas with an electrical charge, causing the gas
to emit electrons, rather than just shooting them
out of an electron “gun.”) And the great thing is
that an SED can be high resolution (easily meet-
ing the 1920 x 1080 resolution of the highest
HDTV standards) while using less than half the
power that a plasma or LCD flat panel uses.
We were blown away by the demos we saw,
and predict that SED will be the next big thing in
flat-panel displays (unless the LCD and plasma
manufacturers can keep up!). Expect to see the
first SED sets hitting the market by the end of
2006 or early 2007. Keep your eyes peeled!
And if that’s not enough to anticipate, another
technology called O-LED (Organic LED), origi-
nally thought up by the folks at Kodak, is on the
way. This technology is similar to LCD, but uses
an organic material that can generate its own
light — LCDs require a backlight to shine
through the LCD — and which will be cheaper,
thinner, and brighter than O-LED.
Personally, we have a love/hate relationship
with these kinds of new technologies. We love
them (LOVE THEM!) for their performance and
how they improve the state of the home theater
art. We hate that we know about them and then
have to consider whether to buy new gear now
or to wait for that “next big thing.” Our advice to
you is that there will always be a next big thing
just around the corner. So if you’re ready to buy
now, don’t wait for these technologies. But if
they start to hit the market when you’re in the
market yourself, by all means check them out!

Demystifying LCD
If you have a laptop computer, a digital watch, a handheld computer, or just
about anything electronic, you’ve probably seen, touched, felt, and used a liquid
crystal display, or LCD. We first saw LCDs on digital watches back when we were
kids (we thought they were cool) and never imagined the size they’d grow to.
We certainly never thought LCDs would one day display high-resolution images
with millions of gradations of color. But that’s exactly what they can do, and are
doing, in an increasing number of homes and home theaters.
You may be wondering how LCD displays actually work. Well here’s the short
answer. (There are armies of lab-coated PhDs working at the manufacturers
of these things who can give you the long answer!) An LCD display consists 
of a large number of pixels (or picture elements) consisting of liquid crystal
molecules being held between two sets of transparent electrodes. These
liquid crystals react in predictable ways when the electrical charge running
between those electrodes is changed — meaning they twist and move in
ways that let different amounts (and colors) of light through the crystals. The
LCD has a control system that translates your video signals into the proper
charges for each of those electrodes. A light source (usually a fluorescent
bulb, though LED bulbs are starting to hit the market) shines through the LCD
panel (it’s built into your display, and is typically there for the life of the dis-
play) and creates your picture.
Because the light shines through the liquid crystals, rather than reflecting off
of them or being created by them, an LCD is what is known as a transmissive
display. Generally speaking, transmissive displays are slightly less bright —
you lose some of the bulb’s brightness going through the crystals — but LCD
makers can make up for this by using a really bright bulb for the backlight.
Despite these amazing changes, LCDs tend to be the smallest displays — or
at least smaller per dollar spent. Put a different way, LCD displays tend to
cost the most for a given screen size — a plasma of the same size will typi-
cally cost about 30 percent less than an LCD unit.
This price difference is a result of the process of “growing” LCD crystals.
Unfortunately for us consumers, that process is quite complicated — and the
bigger the crystal, the harder (and more expensive) it is to make. Most of the
LCD displays top out at about 45 inches, and the typical LCD is smaller still, at
about 37 inches. (See Figure 14-2.) So most folks will use an LCD in a smaller
home theater setting — where a 37-inch display makes sense — and move up
to a plasma or projection unit if they need a larger display.
We’re talking about direct-view LCDs here (where you look directly at the
LCD, just as you look directly at the picture tube with direct-view tube TV).
LCDs can also be used in projector TVs (both front and rear), and we talk
about them later in this chapter — in the “Getting Into Projection TVs” sec-
tion, if you want us to be specific.
198
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

A few companies make mega-big LCD displays. As we write (early 2006),
we’ve seen prototypes for LCD displays as big as 82 inches diagonally. And
new technologies, such as O-LED (Organic LED), promise LCD-like displays
in even bigger sizes in the future. We’ve even seen prototype systems that
seamlessly combine three smaller (and easier-to-build) LCD panels into a
larger single panel — making a cheaper big LCD.
Most LCD television monitors are built in the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio,
although some vendors sell 4:3 versions (which are more typical for PC
screens). We prefer the widescreen versions of LCDs because 16:9 LCDs don’t
tend to “wear out” unevenly (like direct-view CRTs do) when used to display
4:3 video programming.
LCD displays have a couple of particular strong points when it comes to play-
ing video:
 Extremely high resolutions: LCDs can easily reach HDTV resolutions (in
fact, most LCD displays do). You can easily find a 1080p-capable LCD dis-
play — most plasma displays are 720p instead.
 Excellent color: LCDs offer exceptional reproduction of colors, with the
potential for beautifully re-created colors across the spectrum. This dif-
fers from other flat-panel displays (such as plasma systems), which
often tend to inaccurately display certain colors.
 Great picture: The newest (and most expensive) LCDs use an LED (light
emitting diode) instead of a traditional bulb for their light source. These
LEDs produce a higher-quality picture because the LED itself emits a
more natural (closer to daylight) light than does a bulb (which tends to
be yellowish, not true white).
 PC monitor–capable: This probably won’t surprise you because you’re
probably familiar with LCD computer monitors. Most LCD television dis-
plays can also do double-duty as a PC monitor, plugging directly into any
PC with a standard PC video cable.

Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

 No burn-in: If you play a lot of video games, watch the stock ticker on
MSNBC, or do other things with your display that involve a lot of static
content (images that don’t change or move around) on a CRT display,
you can end up with those images permanently burned into the phos-
phors on your screen. When these images become permanently etched
into the phosphor, you see them even when you’re watching something
else. Because LCDs use a separate backlight instead of creating their
own light with phosphors, they are immune to this problem (plasmas
are not, by the way).
You can get a stuck pixel on an LCD screen, where a single pixel always
emits a color (often red). This can be annoying, so check your manufac-
turer’s warranty to see whether they will repair a display if it has stuck
pixels. This is a pretty rare occurrence, but it can happen. Most people
don’t even notice it, but if you’re sharp-eyed, it might drive you crazy.
 Inherently progressive: Unlike direct-view systems, LCDs don’t display
their picture using electron guns scanning lines across a screen. Instead,
LCDs use millions of tiny transistors that can be individually controlled
by the “brains” inside the display. This means that LCDs can easily
handle progressive-scan sources, such as progressive-scan DVD and
HDTV — unlike some direct-view systems that simply can’t scan fast
enough to display progressive video.
Besides the size limitation we discuss earlier in this section, consider a few
other problem areas before you buy an LCD system as your primary display
in a home theater:
 Expensive for their size: Inch for viewing inch, LCDs tend to be a bit
more expensive than the plasma flat-panels we discuss next, and much
more expensive than CRT displays. At the beginning of 2006, you could
expect to pay about $1,700 for an HDTV-ready, 37-inch LCD display. For
the same price, you could buy an HDTV-ready, 42-inch plasma set — in
other words, get a bigger monitor for the same price.
 Poor reproduction of blacks: Compared with direct-view tube displays,
LCDs do a poor job of reproducing black images. Darker screen images
never show up as true black, but rather as various shades of gray, and
actions happening in these darker areas are difficult to discern.
 Poor response time: Some LCD displays suffer from a poor response
time — meaning it takes a while for the pixels to change colors in
response to a rapidly changing scene in your video program. This can
bug the living daylights out of some people, particularly when you’re
watching sports (you might see a trail of a moving ball on the screen, 
for example).
Most new LCD TVs have this problem licked — to be sure, look for a
response time of less than 16 milliseconds.
200
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

 Limited viewing angle: Although they are getting better (due to some
intensive efforts by manufacturers), LCDs typically have a poor viewing
angle. If you are not sitting almost directly in front of the screen, you
don’t get a good picture.
 Limited brightness: Because LCDs use a backlight shining through the
liquid crystal, most of the light is absorbed. As a result, the LCD displays
have lower contrast and are harder to view in a brightly lit room (the
picture appears washed out), compared with CRT TVs.
Staying on the cutting edge with plasma
Perhaps the coolest thing to come down the home theater pike in quite some
time (maybe ever!) is the larger, flat-screen monitor that uses plasma technol-
ogy. A plasma screen contains literally millions of gas-filled cells (or pixels)
wedged between two pieces of glass. An electrical grid zaps these pixels and
causes the gases to ionize (the ionized gas is plasma — hence the name). The
ionized gases, in turn, cause a layer of phosphor on the outside layer of glass
to light up (just like the electron gun in a CRT causes the phosphor to light
up on the front of the tube).
Plasma displays have really captured the attention of the home theater indus-
try (and of home theater consumers) because of the sheer size and quality 
of the picture they can produce. They’re also known for their compact size.
Plasma displays are available in 42-, 50-, and even 60-inch sizes — and they
can get even bigger. (Panasonic showed off a 103-inch plasma at the 2006
Consumer Electronics show — don’t even ask about the price!) Even at the
larger sizes, the display itself is usually no more than 5 or 6 inches deep —
and suitable for wall hanging! All the plasma displays in these sizes (which
are by far the most common, at least in the U.S. market) have a 16:9 aspect
ratio.
Other benefits of plasma displays include the following:
 Excellent brightness: Because plasma displays use the direct lighting of
phosphors (instead of a backlighting system like LCDs), they can have an
extremely bright and crisp picture, just like a direct-view CRT TV. In fact,
because each pixel is controlled directly by the electrical grid behind the
plasma cells, the brightness tends to be extremely even across the screen.
In a CRT, the electron guns shoot at the phosphors from differing angles
depending upon which part of the screen the gun is creating, which can
cause uneven brightness in badly designed CRTs.
 High resolution: Although not all plasma displays can reach HDTV
levels of resolution (many “inexpensive” $2,000 plasma models can’t
show true HDTV), they do typically provide greater resolution than CRT
displays. This is especially true of the more expensive HDTV plasmas,
201
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

which can often reach higher horizontal resolutions that CRT sets can’t
match. Just about all plasma displays on the market are 16:9 aspect ratio
sets, which is also essential for HDTV viewing.
 PC monitor–capable: Like LCD screens, most plasma displays can be
plugged directly into any PC (not just home theater PCs with special TV
video cards) to act as a gigantic PC monitor.
 No geometric distortion: In a CRT display, the electron guns that
shoot their beams on the phosphor screen are in a fixed location (the
center/back of the tube). The angle at which these beams hit the phos-
phor varies; in the middle of the screen, the angle is perpendicular, but
the angle is quite different at the corners of the screen. This can cause
distortions in the picture — geometric distortions caused by this chang-
ing angle. In a plasma display, each gas pocket is at an identical angle
(and distance) to the phosphor it lights up, so you don’t get distortions
around the edge of the picture.
 Progressive by nature: Like LCDs, plasma systems don’t use a scanning
electron beam to create a picture. Instead, all the pixels on the screen
are lit up simultaneously. So progressive video sources display progres-
sively on any plasma system; you don’t need to buy a special progres-
sive set like you do with CRT displays.
 A wide viewing angle: Unlike LCDs (which often have problems in this
regard), plasma displays have a good picture even when you are sitting
“off axis” (not perpendicular to the screen surface). In a smaller room,
where some of the seating might be at a rather acute angle from the
screen, the wide viewing angle can be a big plus.
Of course, the plasma equation has a few downsides (besides the fact that a
lot of us can’t afford the $3,000 it costs for an HDTV plasma):
 Susceptible to burn-in: Any system that uses a phosphor screen to dis-
play video can fall victim to the phosphor burn-in mentioned earlier in
this chapter. If you do a lot of video gaming or stock/news ticker view-
ing, you need to be aware of this fact. Although burn-in can also be an
issue with a CRT set, it’s an even bigger issue with a plasma, considering
the price. You can’t remove burn-in after it’s happened; you need to
either live with it or replace the display.
You can minimize burn-in on any display by calibrating the set properly
and by reducing the brightness from its (usually too high) factory setting.
 Shorter lifespan: Another phenomenon of any phosphor-based display
system is that eventually the phosphors “wear out” or lose their bright-
ness. Like burn-in, this degradation also happens to CRT-based direct-
view displays, but it often happens faster with plasma displays. Given
the considerably higher cost of a plasma, your cost per hour of viewing
is much higher. Before you buy, check the manufacturer’s specifications
on hours to half brightness (the point at which the display is only half as
bright as it was when new). For example, if this specification is 20,000
202
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

hours, and you watch the set for 6 hours a day, it will be effectively worn
out in about 9 years. If you have kids, keep in mind that 6 hours a day is
not an excessive estimate for how long the television may be turned on
every day.
 Not as high resolution as LCD: Even though many (and soon, we expect,
most) plasma TVs can display high-definition TV, they do so at the 720p
resolution. Only a few, very expensive plasmas are capable of 1080p res-
olutions — though an increasing number will be in the near future.
 Less than perfect color reproduction: Although plasma displays are
capable of producing a breathtaking array of colors, all the sets built to
date have had an unfortunate tendency to make red colors look more
orange than true red. This has held true on just about every plasma set
out there. Only a few factories in the whole world make some key com-
ponents for plasma screens, so all these sets share certain characteris-
tics, and this is unfortunately one of them. We’re sure that this problem
will be solved over time, but it is something to keep in mind (particu-
larly if you’re a Cincinnati Reds fan!).
 Poor reproduction of black: Although plasma displays are an equal to
CRT sets in terms of absolute brightness, they fall short in the contrast
ratio comparison. Like LCDs, plasma displays have a really hard time
reproducing black, so black scenes end up being reproduced as shades
of gray.
We think that these shortcomings are far from fatal. We love plasma displays,
but we realize that they aren’t for everyone. In many home theaters, perhaps
the biggest factor supporting the plasma display (besides the undeniable
wow factor that comes out every time you look at one in action) is their
amazing compactness relative to screen size.
There’s an acronym in the industry, SAF (spousal acceptance factor), that
absolutely applies to the plasma display. (Actually, the term is WAF, but we’re
being politically correct here.) If your spouse isn’t really into the concept of a
home theater and hates the idea of a huge TV cluttering up the family or living
room, a plasma may be your home theater salvation. You don’t even have to
tell him or her you wanted one anyway (because of the awesome picture).
Grumble a little bit and get some brownie points out of your purchase!
Getting Into Projection TVs
When you go to the movies, the images you see are projected onto that big
screen in front of you. If size matters to you (and if you have the room in your
home theater — and seats far enough away from the screen), then you too
should consider a projector for your home theater’s display system. Even if
size isn’t a huge deal to you, you may decide to go with a front-projection
system because they can offer the ultimate in home theater image quality.
203
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

In this section, we talk about the two types of projectors available for home
theater: all-in-one rear-projection systems and movie projector–like front-
projection systems. We also talk about the different kinds of projector sys-
tems found in both front and rear projectors. And, finally, we get into the
choices you’ll find for separate screens (needed if you buy a front-projection
system).
For many home theater enthusiasts, a theater isn’t really a theater unless 
you have a projector. Until the advent of the plasma flat panel (discussed in
the previous chapter), projectors were really the only choice for big screens
(bigger than the approximately 40-inch limit of CRT direct-view TVs, at least).
And while 60-inch plasmas are now on the market, you still need a projector
system to get a really big picture. (Front-projection screens can be as big as
10 feet or more across!)
But projection systems don’t need to break the bank either. Rear-projection
systems (RPTVs) are perhaps the best value in home theater, at least in terms
of bang for the buck. For a few thousand bucks — or even less, as new tech-
nologies like DLP (Digital Light Processor) begin to saturate the market —
you can get a picture as big as a plasma, in full HDTV glory. You can’t hang
one of these units on the wall, but visually, the picture is at least as good as
(and often better than) plasma, for thousands less. In particular, RPTVs are
much better than most plasma displays at reproducing blacks on-screen,
which means you get superior reproduction of darker scenes when you’re
watching movies or television.
204
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Going all-in-one
Typically, front-projection displays are the “high
end” of the market. Folks considering one of
these in their theater will often spend $4,000 or
more for the combination of the projector and
screen. As a result, many folks who want to
spend $2,000 or so for a big-screen system will
choose a rear-projection TV (something we rec-
ommend). There’s a new category of projection
systems on the market that turns this formula on
its head — front-projection displays in a very
inexpensive form that anyone can afford.
These “all-in-one” front-projection systems are
the display equivalent of the “home theater in a
box” solutions for audio that we discuss in
Chapter 2. Essentially, these include a DLP-
powered front projector, a DVD player, and even
(in most cases) a pair of speakers. They’re no
substitute for a full home theater system, but an
easy way to get up and running. We think the
best use for these devices is as a home theater
solution for the kids’ playroom, for the vacation
home, or anywhere besides your true home the-
ater. They’re also great for gamers — plug in an
Xbox or PlayStation, shine the projector on the
wall, and you’re ready for some truly big-screen
Halo or Gran Turismo action!
None of these all-in-one systems supports
HDTV resolutions (though we expect that newer
versions will), but you get a lot for your money
(typically just a shade more than $1,000). Check
out Radio Shack’s Cinego 1000 ($1,300) and
Optoma’s DV-10 ($1,500 list, less on-line) for
some good examples of these systems.

Choosing between front and rear projection
The first big decision to make when evaluating projection systems is, for
most people, the easiest: front or rear projection. We say this is the easiest
decision to make because we find that most people choose a rear-projection
system. They are cheaper (generally speaking, though high-end rear projec-
tors can definitely cost more than low-end front-projection systems), and
they are easier to set up and integrate into your home theater.
Having said that, let’s define the difference between these systems. It’s quite
simple, really:
 Front projection: A front projector is very similar to a movie projector
(except it doesn’t use film). It includes a projector unit (which is usually
mounted on your ceiling but can also be on a lift, on a floor mount, or in
the rear wall) and a separate screen. Video sources (such as DVDs,
cable, and satellite TV) are routed into the projector, which then turns
these signals into light. Then, the light is (ding ding ding, you guessed it)
projected onto a separate screen that’s mounted on a wall at the front of
your home theater. Figure 14-3 shows a front-projection system.
 Rear-projection: These are the traditional big-screen TVs that have been
sold for years and years. If your Uncle Vinnie got a big screen back in 1987
for Superbowl XXI, this is what he has. Now some people, having seen the
lousy, washed-out picture on Uncle Vinnie’s TV, think that rear projectors
trade picture quality for size. Nothing can be further from the truth. A
good-quality, well-set-up rear projector can offer an awesome picture. A
rear-projection TV (or RPTV) has both parts of the front projector (the
projector and the screen) in a single, all-in-one box, and the projector illu-
minates the back of the screen instead of the front. Figure 14-4 shows a
rear-projection system.
Figure 14-3:
A front-
projection
system.
205
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

RPTVs are great. In fact, we think they may be the best value in home theater
big-screen displays. But they do have two limitations: a limited viewing angle
and size. Because of the way video is internally reflected toward the screen in
these sets, you need to be perpendicular (or near-perpendicular) to the dis-
play to see a good picture. Keep that limitation in mind as you consider an
RPTV. If your home theater room is set up with widely dispersed seating, an
RPTV may not be your best choice. Also, rear-projection TVs can be very
deep and overwhelm a room with their size. For some, this is a limitation.
If you have a really big room, and you can keep it dark enough to use a front-
projection system, then front projection is the way to get that truly movie
theater–sized picture. But the dark room is a major must to get the most out
of a front-projection system. Don’t think you can set up a front projector in
your family room (you know, the room with the picture window on one wall
and the sliding glass door on the other — oh yeah, and the skylight too!) and
get a good picture. You can, but only if you spend a lot of time and effort
blocking out the light. You need a dark room to get the most out of front pro-
jection — that’s why we recommend rear-projection systems for the average
home theater builder who doesn’t have a dedicated room and who wants to
be able to watch TV in the broad daylight.
Figure 14-4:
The all-
in-one rear-
projection
system.
206
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

It may sound obvious, but don’t forget that you’ll need to have an unimpeded
path between the projector and the screen in a front projection system.
Unless you’re just a huge fan of MST3k (www.mst3kinfo.org) and want to
see people’s head’s silhouetted on the screen, you’ll need to be able to keep
the air between your projector and screen clear of all objects.
Now, we’ve already come right out and said that for most people — most
people, not all people — rear-projection systems are probably the best
choice. As we mention earlier, the lower cost and easier setup make rear pro-
jectors more consumer-friendly. (You don’t have to spend nearly as much
time getting the projector properly aligned and aimed at the screen with a
rear projector — though you do have to spend some time doing this.) But
with the advent of new, computer-based technologies such as DLP (Digital
Light Processor) chips, front projectors have begun to drop in price from the
stratospheric ($20,000 to $60,000) to the reasonable (well under $2,000), and
the setup of these new systems is easier, too (which we explain in a minute).
Rather than take up your valuable reading time with a long-winded descrip-
tion of the relative benefits and shortcomings of these two types of projec-
tors, we’ve created the handy-dandy Table 14-1 to enlighten, educate, and
energize the home theater portion of your brain.

Selecting a projection method
As you move past the rear- versus front-projection decision, you’ll find that
you really haven’t decided anything at all. Four main technologies that are
currently on the market do the actual work of converting electrical video
source signals into light that can be projected onto the screen. Each of these
can be found in either front- or rear-projection units. Keep in mind, however,
that new variants of these technologies, as well as entirely new ways of pro-
jecting video, are being invented all the time.
207
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

Catching on to the cathode ray
We cover the CRT, or cathode ray tube, in the first section of this chapter, so
we’re not going to get into a long discussion about what they are or how they
work here. However, that good, old-fashioned tube is not only the heart of
most conventional TVs, but also the centerpiece of the most sophisticated,
highest-quality projector systems (which is to say, the most sophisticated,
highest-quality displays, period).
CRT projectors, particularly front-projection systems, can provide the high-
est resolution (including full HDTV support), the most excellent color, and 
a bright picture with a superb contrast ratio. (If any of these terms seems
unfamiliar to you, refer to Chapter 13.) CRT projectors also provide the best
reproduction of black tints — significantly better than any of the other pro-
jector types available.
Unlike direct-view CRT displays, which use a single picture tube, CRT projec-
tors use three separate tubes — one each for red, green, and blue. The extra
tubes make the setup and calibration more complex because the light projec-
tion from these three CRTs must be converged (aligned so that they each hit
the screen at the same place). If you’ve seen bad projection TV before, with
inaccurate color reproduction and colored “halos” around objects, you’ve
probably seen a system that has not been properly converged. It’s not pretty.
Convergence on projection systems tends to drift over time, so you need to
think about resetting the convergence a couple of times a year. Luckily, many
RPTVs now include an automatic convergence system that simplifies this
process. In Chapter 19, we discuss how you can do your own calibration or
hire a professional to calibrate your projection system.
Perhaps the biggest factor to consider when comparing CRT projectors is
tube size. In the RPTV realm, this isn’t a huge deal. Almost all RPTVs have 
the same size (7-inch) tubes, but front projectors have tubes in the 7-, 8-, and
9-inch ranges. Bigger tubes bring with them sharper, more detailed pictures,
but at a considerably higher price. In fact, the price differential between a 
7- or 8-inch projector and a 9-inch model can be striking. You can get a decent
7-inch front projector for under $10,000 (still a lot), but 9-inch CRT projectors
usually start off in the $30,000 range.
Keep in mind three things about any CRT projector system (front or RPTV):
 Brightness can be an issue: This isn’t a major problem for RPTVs, where
the tube is relatively close to the screen, but in a front projector environ-
ment, the CRT is the least bright of all the alternatives. Imagine trying 
to light up a screen across the room with your old direct-view TV (not
really a fair comparison, but the technology is very similar), and you’ll
understand that a CRT doesn’t throw off a ton of light. The other sys-
tems we discuss use a separate (high-powered) light source, which gives
them greater brightness. So a CRT front projector works best in a room
208
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

with very little ambient light; in fact, near total darkness works best.
(Total darkness gives you the best picture with any front-projection
system.)
 Tubes wear out: Just as direct-view CRTs lose brightness over time, so
do CRT projectors. In fact, because CRT projectors need to be set up to
project more light than a direct-view TV (especially front projectors),
CRT tubes in a projector tend to wear out even faster. Check the manu-
facturer’s specifications for how quickly its tubes lose brightness and
plan on budgeting some home theater money for new tubes based on
those specifications. This isn’t a cheap fix. You can spend thousands of
dollars on new tubes every time you need to replace them, so read the
fine print.
 Tubes can get burn-in: Burn-in occurs when static content, such as
video games, permanently alters the phosphors on your CRT, so that
you always see, for example, a ghost image of Halo’s weapons status on
your screen. If you (or your kids) play a ton of video games, we suggest
you look at one of the other projector technologies we’re about to dis-
cuss. Burn-in can also be a problem when the CRTs have a fixed aspect
ratio. For example, if you have 16:9 (widescreen) tubes and watch a ton
of 4:3 (traditional square screen) content, you can end up with uneven
brightness on the tubes. This occurs because the center of the tube is
constantly in use, but the edges are used only occasionally. (We discuss
burn-in earlier in this chapter.)
We’ve given you a quick overview of CRT projectors. CRT RPTVs are the kind
of product you can buy, install, and set up on your own, if you want to. We
think that a CRT front projector is something you need professional help
with. That includes help choosing the right model and an associated screen
and help installing, configuring, and maintaining the projector. It’s a huge
investment, and you should find a dealer you’re comfortable with who can
help you down this path.
The success of the next three projection technologies we discuss (LCD, DLP,
and LCoS) have pretty much taken the wind out of the CRT projection TV
market. You can still buy CRT-based projectors, but they are increasingly
rare. Microdisplay projectors using these newer technologies just have too
many advantages for the average home theater builder, so sales of the CRT-
based models have plummeted.
Projecting with LCDs
LCD technologies have been used for years and years for relatively low-quality
projectors — the kind you might have in the conference room at work for
projecting those ubiquitous PowerPoint slides on the white board during
mind-numbingly boring meetings.
209
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

Well, the LCD has come of age in the era of home theater, and now you can
buy front-projection systems based on the LCD that provide a high-quality
(often HDTV) picture at a price that is typically lower than that of CRT front-
projection systems. (Note that LCD RPTVs aren’t much cheaper than CRT
RPTVs and may even cost more, simply because the small tubes used in
RPTVs are dirt cheap.)
LCD projectors typically use three small LCD panels (a couple of inches across
at most) — one each for red, green, and blue picture information. Behind these
panel is a strong lamp that provides the light. LCDs (and the DLP and LCoS 
projectors we discuss next) are fixed-pixel displays, meaning that they display
video at a certain resolution. For example, Sony’s most recent LCD RPTV dis-
plays at 1,366 pixels horizontally and 768 pixels vertically (this exceeds the 720
vertical pixels required for 720i, so the set is HDTV-ready). An internal device
called an image scaler converts the incoming signal (such as 480p from pro-
gressive scan DVDs or 1080i from an HDTV broadcast) to the 1366 x 768 resolu-
tion for display. LCD projectors are inherently progressive, so even standard
NTSC broadcasts are converted to a progressive-scan mode for display.
The quality of the image scaler — how well it converts other signals to the
fixed-pixel resolution native to the LCD — is a key factor in a projector’s pic-
ture quality. In Chapter 21, we talk about external image scalers (and related
devices such as line doublers and quadruplers) that can improve the picture
quality of a projection system — and not just for fixed-pixel displays, but also
for CRT projection systems as well.
Because you never know who’ll come up with a better system the month after
this book is printed, we generally avoid dropping brand name recommenda-
tions. However, we find that scalers from one company, Faroudja (now owned
by Genesis Microchip — www.gnss.com), are always excellent. You can find
many different brands of projectors (and HDTVs in general) that use Faroudja
chips (notably the DCDI chip) to scale, or upconvert, images.
LCD projector systems have a couple of big advantages, when compared with
CRT projectors:
 Lower-cost front projectors: Although CRT front projectors can cost an
arm and three legs, you can buy a quality LCD front projector for less
than $2,000.
 More-compact RPTVs: Because the LCD panels and the lamp are small,
LCD RPTVs can be much thinner than CRT RPTVs. Although many CRT
systems can be 3 or more feet deep, LCD systems can be less than 15
inches deep. That helps a lot both in small rooms and with the SAF
(spousal acceptance factor).
210
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

 Brighter than CRT: The separate lamp used in CRT projectors puts out a
ton of light. (You wouldn’t want to have someone shine one in your eyes
close up!) The result is a brighter picture that can tolerate more ambient
light in your home theater.
For the best brightness and color reproduction, look for LCD projectors
(typically only RPTVs) that use LED backlights instead of traditional
bulbs.
 Don’t need to be converged: Despite the fact that an LCD projector con-
tains three LCD panels, it has only one light source. So you don’t need to
converge the picture like you do with a CRT projector. This makes the
setup much easier for mere mortals.
 Burn-in isn’t a big issue: Plug in that Xbox or PlayStation and play all the
games you want. Because LCD systems don’t use phosphors, they can’t
get permanent burn-in like CRTs (or flat-panel plasma systems) can.
Of course, there’s got to be a downside, right? LCD projectors don’t do a
couple of things well:
 Relatively poor black performance: LCD projectors, like LCD direct-
view sets, can’t display true black tints well. Dark scenes end up being
gray instead. So when the Orcs are sneaking up on Frodo from the
mouth of that dark cave, you can’t see them all that well.
 Limited resolution: Today’s LCD panels can reach HDTV resolutions (at
least 720p resolutions), but most can’t display the full resolution of 1080i
content. To do so, the LCD panels need a resolution of 1920 x 1080, and
none we know of are there yet.
 The lamp will wear out: Nothing lasts forever, and the high-output
lamps on LCD projectors tend to wear out after a few thousand hours of
use. That lifespan is a lot less than the one for tubes on a CRT, but LCD
projector lamps cost a lot less to replace (hundreds instead of thou-
sands of dollars).
 The “stuck pixel” problem: If you own a laptop computer (or a desktop
computer with an LCD display), you may be familiar with the issue of
stuck pixels. These are usually minor manufacturing defects that cause
individual pixels to not light up when the display tells them to. Because
the relative size of pixels in a projection system is large, you may notice
a dead pixel on your screen (and be very annoyed by it). Many manufac-
turers think that having a few stuck pixels is just part of doing business,
and they will not replace your LCD panels except in extreme cases. As a
result, it is a good idea to find out the manufacturer’s “dead pixel policy”
before you buy.

Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

 The “screen door”: When LCD images are projected onto big screens (like
the ones you find in a front-projector system), you can begin to see the
pixel structure of the LCD itself. By this we mean the physical structure of
the LCD that separates the individual pixels. Because of the way LCDs are
constructed, you can look closely at a large projected image and see dots
of lighter and darker areas — like you’re looking at the world through a
metal screen door. We should emphasize that this isn’t a huge issue. This
“screen door” effect is sort of like the scan lines on a CRT system in that
you really notice it only if you’re too close to a big image.

and more good old-fashioned marketing talk than you can shake a stick 
at, check out 3LCD.com, a consortium of manufacturers of LCD projection
systems.
Deciding on a DLP
Texas Instruments has developed (over the course of many years) a com-
pletely new way of projecting video called the DLP (short for Digital Light
Processor). DLP has created a whole new category of inexpensive projector
systems and has also led to a digital revolution in those old-fashioned movie
theaters you used to go to before you got a home theater. If you were lucky
enough to see Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith in a digital theater,
you have already seen DLP (a super-high-end, expensive version) in action.
The DLP is an entirely digital process that utilizes a semiconductor generi-
cally called the DMD (digital micromirror device). The DMD contains over a
million incredibly tiny, hinged mirrors. Each of these mirrors represents a
single pixel on your video image. The DLP chip’s electronic logic controls the
hinges on the mirrors, turning them so that they either reflect light (onto
your screen) or block it (creating a dark spot on the screen). When the DLP’s
“brains” turn these mirrors on and off, the mirrors create different levels of
light between black and white that result in a grayscale version of your image.
A device called a color wheel filters light from a lamp (like the lamps found in
LCD projectors), reflects this off the mirrors on the DLP chip, and provides
the color in your image. This is really a Mach III fly-by of the details of DLP; 
if you want to know the nitty gritty, check out Texas Instruments’ site at
www.dlp.com.
The DLP system we just described, with the color wheel, is called a single-chip
DLP solution, and is by far the most common in consumer DLP projectors.
Movie theater projectors (and a few ultra-expensive home theater models)
dispense with the color wheel, and use three DLP chips (one for red, one 
for green, and one for blue). These three-chip projectors can produce more
gradations of color than a single-chip system but cost a heck of a lot more.
212
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

When looking at DLP projectors, the most important factor to consider is 
the capabilities of the DLP chip, which is the heart of the system. Like LCDs,
DLPs are fixed-pixel displays, and Texas Instruments has a couple of chips 
on the market with different aspect ratios and different resolutions. Early 
DLP chips were designed for 4:3 video reproduction (with a lower-resolution
16:9 mode), but current models are designed for 16:9 aspect ratios.
Most DLP chips can reproduce HDTV resolutions. However, some less expen-
sive versions cannot. All DLP chips that we know of can reproduce 16:9
widescreen progressive scan video (which is 848 x 480 pixels), but the fancier
versions can reproduce 720p and even 1080p HDTV signals. The latest and
greatest DLP chip (given the nature of the computer industry, this will change
relatively soon) is called the xHD4, which offers a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1920
x 1080 pixel resolution.
There’s a lot of discussion in various Internet forums about all of the different
DLP chips that TI makes and sells to display manufacturers. If you dig deep
enough, you can usually find some info about a specific chip and a specific
TV, but in fact this information is usually pretty well hidden. TI (and the dis-
play manufacturers) tend not to speak about individual chips (like xHD3 or
xHD4), but rather about the resolution of the chips (720p or 1080p).
DLP projectors share many of the advantages of LCD models: low price, com-
pact size (with particularly thin RPTVs possible), and immunity from image
burn-in. They also share what many find to be the biggest of the same draw-
backs: less-than-perfect reproduction of blacks (but better than most LCD
projectors). But DLPs don’t have the screen door issue we mention earlier
and, additionally, have one big advantage over the other types of projectors
we’ve discussed so far: They are brighter (and therefore better in rooms that
aren’t too dark). In a DLP chip, light from the lamp is reflected off the mirrors,
but in an LCD, light is transmitted through the liquid crystals, which causes a
decrease in brightness.
213
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies
Weebles wobble
Texas Instruments got together with com-
puter/technology behemoth Hewlett Packard
and incorporated one of HP’s technologies into
some of its DLP chips. Called wobbulation, this
technology allows each of the individual mirrors
within a DLP chip to address (or beam its
reflected light at) two different pixels. What this
does is allow a chip with a resolution of 960 x
1080 to effectively have a resolution of 1920 x
1080 (the full resolution of 1080i/p high defini-
tion). TI calls this technology smooth picture.
Many 1080p-capable DLP TVs use this technol-
ogy to achieve their full resolution. Nothing
wrong with that, but testing has found that some
displays using wobbulation don’t quite achieve
the full resolution in the real world. The latest
DLP displays (announced as we write, but not
yet on the market) will offer true 1080p resolu-
tion without this wobbulation technique —
which promises to provide a better picture.

One issue that some folks have with DLP projectors is something called the
rainbow effect. During a highly contrasted scene (such as white on a black
background), some folks can see a shimmery colored image (like a rainbow,
naturally!) in their peripheral vision. Not everyone can see this, but some
small percentage of the population sees it and is annoyed (to the point of
headaches or even dizziness!). You can minimize the rainbow effect by choos-
ing a three-chip DLP set with individual DLP chips for red, green, and blue —
many folks believe that the color wheel in single-chip projectors causes the
effect.
The newest trend in DLP is to use a single chip, but to replace the color wheel
and single light source with three LED light sources (red, blue, and green). This
helps get rid of the rainbow effect and has the additional benefit of improving
the color reproduction of the DLP projector. LEDs are really cool things — we
think you’ll start seeing them more and more in home theater displays (as well
as in everyday objects like flashlights, car headlights, and other lighting sys-
tems). They have the advantage, when compared with incandescent lighting, of
truer colors, lower energy consumption, and greatly increased life spans.
We love the future of DLP projectors (both front and rear). They have great pic-
tures, are relatively inexpensive, and are a snap to set up. As the technology
matures, we think this may end up being the predominant projection system of
the future — already over 75 manufacturers use the technology in their projec-
tor systems. Given the nature of the microprocessor business, we think that
DLP chips will get much cheaper and much more capable faster than you can
bat an eye. You can already buy a good-quality HDTV-ready front-projection
DLP system for under $3,000. And DLP RPTVs typically offer the best “bang for
the buck,” providing the best mixture of price and picture quality — better pic-
ture quality than most LCD RPTVs for the same price, and almost as good as
the LCoS displays we discuss in the next section, for less.
Looking at LCoS
Another “projector-on-a-chip” system that has hit the market in recent years is
the LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon) system. A couple of different manufactur-
ers are making LCoS systems, but the most prominent to date have been JVC,
with a system called D-ILA (Digital Direct Drive Image Light Amplifier) — we’re
puzzled by the acronym, but we guess DDDILA is too hard to remember — and
Sony, with its SXRD (Silicon Crystal X-tal — for acronym purposes — Reflective
Display) projection TVs.
LCoS systems are basically a new variant of LCDs. LCoS systems still use
liquid crystals, but instead of transmitting light through the liquid crystal
(like an LCD does), LCoS reflects the light like a DLP, resulting in a signifi-
cantly brighter image.
214
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

There aren’t a lot of LCoS projectors on the market yet, but those that are
available — that is to say, JVC’s D-ILA models, Sony’s SXRD models, and a few
others — have perhaps the finest picture quality of any projection displays
available.
LCoS systems offer true 1080p resolution (with no tricks like the wobbulation
we discuss in the “Weebles wobble” sidebar) and an incredibly smooth, film-
like image. LCoS beats out LCD projection systems in the brightness game,
while avoiding the rainbow effects found in DLPs.
LCoS is also known for exceptional black reproduction, rivaling, if not quite
matching, the blacks displayed by the super-expensive CRT projection sys-
tems that used to be the high end of the market.
What’s the catch? Well, LCoS projectors are more expensive than LCD or DLP
projectors — there simply isn’t the kind of volume production of the LCoS
microdisplay components to bring the prices down to those levels yet. You
can expect to pay about 30 percent more for a 1080p LCoS display than you
would for an identically sized DLP display.
The good news here is that the prices are coming down rapidly. For example,
Sony’s first generation of SXRD RPTVs cost about twice what a similarly sized
DLP projector would have cost. The models currently shipping as we write
(less than a year into the technology’s life span) are only about $1,000 more
than a similarly sized DLP and offer a better picture. So keep your eye on
LCoS, as it may very well give DLP a run for its (and your) money!
Keeping other features in mind
Regardless of technology, keep in mind a few other things when evaluating
projection systems:
 Fixed versus variable focal length (front projectors only): Some front-
projection systems (including many fancy CRT models) have what’s
known as a fixed focal length. This means that, for a given screen size,
the projector must be placed a fixed and predetermined distance away.
This can limit your placement in the room. If a heating duct on the ceil-
ing is right where the projector needs to be, that’s too bad. Projectors
with variable focal length can be placed in different spots to fit your
room’s layout and then adjusted to focus on the screen properly.
 Light output (front-projection only): We’ve already discussed the vari-
ous projector types with regards to their relative brightness. But within
these categories, projectors vary from model to model in their overall
brightness. This is measured in ANSI lumens and is a good measure of
215
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

how well a system will work in a bright room. Brighter, high-end projec-
tors are often rated at 1,000 or more lumens, whereas cheaper ones are
often below 500. We don’t recommend that you use any projector in a
brightly lit room, but if you simply can’t make the room dark, go for a
brighter unit.
Just because you can crank your amp up to 11, doesn’t mean that you
should. (Please excuse the shameless, pop culture, Spinal Tap refer-
ence.) As we explain in the first section of this chapter, you shouldn’t
leave the brightness on your direct-view CRT system cranked up all the
way, and the same rule applies to a projection system. In Chapter 19, we
talk about how to set up your brightness settings (and a bunch of other
settings) on your display.
 Aspect ratio: In the RPTV world, systems have a fixed aspect ratio.
They’re either 4:3 (standard squarish TV) or 16:9 (widescreen). We rec-
ommend you get the widescreen version unless all you watch is Leave It
to Beaver reruns. Some front projectors also have a fixed native aspect
ratio, but many systems can be adjusted to work at either aspect ratio. If
you don’t have a choice, go with the widescreen, and if you pick a
system with an adjustable aspect ratio, enjoy it!
 Projector noise: Many front-projection TVs employ a cooling fan — par-
ticularly LCD and DLP systems, which need bright (and hot!) lamps to
create the picture. DLP systems may also make an audible noise when
the color wheel spins. Keep in mind the fact that, in a small room, you
may hear these noises, which can be annoying. Try to audition your pro-
jector in your dealer’s showroom and pay attention to the noise it
makes. You have to live with it after you buy it!
 Everything we discuss in Chapter 13: This is our convenient catch-all
category. In Chapter 13, we list a ton of things to consider when evaluat-
ing a display system, such as the number of inputs, the adjustability of
the system, and so on. We really don’t feel like repeating ourselves, and
we don’t like typing that much (or even cutting and pasting!) either. So
go read Chapter 13 because it all applies here, too.
Selecting your silver screen
As they say in the ginsu knife ads, “But wait, there’s more!” We’ve talked
about the projectors themselves, but in the case of front-projection systems,
we’ve only talked about half the equation. You gotta shine that nice, high-def
image onto something, and we definitely don’t recommend an old bed sheet
or the wall. You need a real screen — just like a movie theater.
216
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Screens come in a couple different forms:
 Portable screens that sit on a tripod: You can fold these up and put them
away when you’re done (but who’s ever done with a home theater?).
These are a bit less than optimal (if you take them down, you need to get
them back in exactly the same spot or refocus the projector — if it can
even be focused!). We don’t recommend these at all.
 Retractable screens: These can be manually or electrically powered.
Although nothing is cooler than pressing a button on the remote and
having the screen come down, this setup will cost you more than the
manual version. You also need to make sure these systems are properly
installed so that they are flat (otherwise the image can be distorted),
and periodically check to make sure they haven’t become misaligned
with use.
 Fixed wall- and ceiling-mounted screens: If you have a dedicated home
theater and you’ll never want to hide the screen, these are probably the
best way to go.
Even more important than the form are the technical characteristics of the
screen. The big four are the following:
 Gain: Gain is a measure of how reflective the screen is — how much of
the projector’s light gets bounced back to your eyeballs. There’s a stan-
dard industry reference for gain, and systems that have exactly as much
gain as that reference are rated at a gain of 1. More-reflective (high-gain)
screens are rated greater than 1 (say 1.2), while less-reflective (low-gain)
screens are rated below 1 (many are rated at 0.8). Generally speaking,
match CRT projectors with high-gain screens (between 1 and 1.3, though
you can go higher if needed). Brighter, fixed-pixel systems like LCD or
DLP can use a low-gain screen (0.8 or lower).
 Viewing angle: Most display systems have a limited angle (from per-
pendicular) in which they look best. Sit outside that angle, and the pic-
ture becomes very dim. For front-projector screens, this viewing angle 
is inversely proportional to gain. In other words, the higher the gain, 
the smaller the angle in which viewers will get a good picture. For this
reason, you are best off choosing the lowest gain screen that works 
with your projector in your room. This is why low-gain screens are rec-
ommended for fixed-pixel projectors; LCD, DLP, and LCoS projectors
have light to spare, so why not trade some of it for a wider viewing
angle? Viewing angles are usually listed in a number of degrees (like 90).
Your viewing angle is half this amount (45, in this case) on either side 
of perpendicular.
217
Chapter 14: Comparing Display Technologies

 Hotspotting: One reason you shouldn’t use a screen with too high a gain
for your projector is the hotspotting phenomenon. When this occurs, one
part of the screen is brighter than the other parts. Typically, the center
of the screen gets too bright, relative to the edges, which makes the pic-
ture on the edges appear washed out.
 Aspect ratio: Screens are available in either the 16:9 widescreen or 4:3
aspect ratios. You should, of course, choose the same aspect ratio as
that of your projector. You can buy (or make your own, if you’re crafty)
masks to cover the unlit portions of the screen when you’re watching
material of a different aspect ratio, so you can cover the sides of the
screen with a mask when you’re watching a 4:3 TV show (more Leave It
to Beaver?) on your 16:9 screen.
Choosing a screen is not something for the faint of heart. Find out what screens
your projector manufacturer recommends, ask your dealer what he or she rec-
ommends, and if at all possible, look at your projector (or the identical model)
on the screen before you buy.
There are three major manufacturers of screens for front-projection displays:
Da-Lite (www.da-lite.com), Draper (www.draperinc.com), and Stewart
Filmscreen (www.stewartfilmscreen.com).

R
emote controls have come a long way since the first clunky universal
remote controls let you manipulate multiple devices from one gadget.
Today, you have all sorts of options: tiny, large, color, touch-sensitive, voice-
controlled, time-controlled, and on and on. You can spend $19 on a great
remote or $5,000 on a “gold plated” touch screen, whole-home remote control
that not only controls all of the devices in your home theater, but that can
also run all of the electronics in your home. Decisions, decisions.
Sifting through Remote Control Options
The remote control is nothing more than a means to tell your system what to
do. The term remote just means you don’t control your home theater equip-
ment manually (by getting up and pushing buttons). Just to show that we all
can be as high-tech as the next guy, let’s treat the remote control as an inter-
face, and say that you can interface with your system in multiple ways.

220
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 
Types of remotes
Hundreds upon hundreds of remotes are out there. Generically, they fall into
the following categories, which are presented in increasing order of function-
ality and desirability:
 Standard/dedicated remotes: These are the device-specific remotes
that come with your system. If you stopped here, you might have ten or
so remotes on your coffee table!
 Brand-based remotes that come with a component: Brand-based remotes
work with all sorts of devices from the same manufacturer. For instance,
the RCA remote you get with an RCA DSS receiver usually has buttons for
your RCA TV and your RCA VCR. There are buttons for each of the devices
supported.
 Third-party universal remote controls: Many leading electronics brands
sell so-called universal remote controls. These remotes supposedly work
with any electronics device by way of onboard code databases. These
remotes generally come with manuals that walk you through setting up
your remote for your specific components. This environment is ever-
changing, however, and we’ve found that you get what you pay for. We’ve
never been happy with cheap universal remotes (like the $20 “do every-
thing” universal remotes you see at the mega-sized electronics stores).
Some capability is always missing. We prefer the slightly more expensive
learning remotes.
Most A/V receivers and TVs and many DVD players come with a univer-
sal remote, but many don’t have a lot of functionality on other brands of
equipment — just the basics.
 Learning remotes: Learning remotes can learn codes from your existing
remote controls. You simply point your remotes at each other, go
through a listing of commands, and the remote codes are transferred
from one to the other. These remotes have a higher success rate than
universal remotes because you are essentially using the same codes as
your present remote — not codes that a database says should work.
Some learning remotes have an onboard, preprogrammed database
against which they try to match the codes being learned; others are
completely learning-based. The downside of a completely learning-based
remote is that, if you lose your original remote, it’s almost impossible to
train this one.
 Programmable remotes: Programmable remotes allow you to create
macros, which are sequential code combinations that do a lot of things at
once. So say you want to watch a movie on a DVD. You could program a
macro to turn on your TV, receiver, and DVD player; set the receiver to the
appropriate source and output modes; and start the DVD in the tray — all
from one button. Now, if it could only pop the popcorn, too. . . .

 Computer-based remotes: Computer-based remotes take advantage of
the growing number of computing devices around the home to provide
remote control capabilities. This category includes PDAs, Web tablets,
portable touch screens, and PCs. Home control software that can drive
your lighting, heating, and other environmental controls in addition to
your home theater needs is also in this group.
 Proprietary systems: A number of closed-system control devices enable
you to integrate control of all your home theater devices on a single con-
trol system. Companies such as Niles Audio (www.nilesaudio.com)
and Crestron (www.crestron.com) are renowned for their control 
systems.
Remote control features
As simple as a remote control seems to be, the world of remotes is insanely
complex. This section discusses some ways in which remotes have gotten
more complex lately.
Radio frequency (RF) versus infrared (IR)
It used to be that all remotes were infrared-based. Now, many are touting RF
connectivity, which is in many ways better than IR. First, RF signals tend to
travel farther than IR. Second, you don’t need to point the remote at the TV
set; RF can go in all directions, even through walls and cabinet doors. The
biggest downside of RF remotes is that you can’t easily integrate them into
one remote (such as a learning remote) — at least not yet. Still, we prefer RF
to IR if we can get it.
The only real downside of RF remotes is that there is the possibility that you
could find yourself unintentionally controlling devices in other rooms. In the
vast majority of cases, you won’t run into this issue, as those other devices
won’t be using the same remote codes as the ones in your home theater room.
Most home theater equipment uses an IR remote control system, so if you
use an RF system, you need some equipment to convert the RF signals to IR
to control these IR-only devices. We talk about how to do this in Chapter 18.
Touch screen displays
Color and grayscale displays are replacing hard buttons on remotes, enabling
them to be far more programmable and customizable for your system. It’s not
unusual that your remote would connect to your PC today in order to cus-
tomize the “soft buttons” on your remote’s screen. We are finding that stand-
alone touch screens are even replacing remotes.
221
Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater

New control options
A lot of new stuff is coming down the pike, but we think two-way operation
and voice control are innovations that will grow in popularity. With two-way
operation, higher-end remotes can interact with the controlled unit to deter-
mine its state. So, for instance, if a unit is already on, your programmed macro
won’t turn it off at the start of its session. And with two-way operation, you
can check your actions to make sure they were carried out, too.
Nice, but not earth-shaking enough in its newness for you? Then try voice
control, which lets you bark out orders to your remote control (and even to
other microphones in your home theater). Want the volume turned up? No
problem: “Higher volume please.” (Have we reached a new threshold when a
couch potato doesn’t even have to lift a thumb?) Voice control functionality
is making its way into a lot of devices, including PDAs and standalone Web
tablets, making voice control a key future item in your home theater.
Another interesting innovation is the docking cradle. A cradle might enable
your remote to charge up, to access the Internet for revised programming
schedules, or to update its internal code databases. (We think docking cradles
are really a covert plot to make sure you always know where your remote is
located.)
IR (infrared) emitters/blasters
When one IR device wants to control another device, it often sends signals 
to the other device’s IR port through an IR blaster — a small device that sits
some distance from (or in the instance of very small versions called emitters,
is taped to) the IR port. Many PC applications interface with your home the-
ater system through an IR blaster (to do things such as change the channel
on your satellite receiver to start recording a program). You might find you
have several IR blasters for different devices in your system. No one feels this
is the best long-term approach because newer devices allow for direct data
interface via Ethernet, low-speed data connections, or even RF. But for now,
IR blasters are the only option for many older systems.
Within specific brands of A/V gear, you will find IR ports for interconnecting
and sharing IR data directly into the motherboard — bypassing the IR port.
This is one of the benefits of using a single manufacturer for your gear.
Examples of this include systems like Sony’s S-Link, which uses a special
cable to connect Sony devices to each other.
For the rest of this chapter, we focus on some of the highlights of this 
section — the things that we think you’ll likely run into or want to have.
222
Part III: Watching and Listening: Display and Control Devices 

Going Universal
Universal remotes are constantly changing and vary in price from about $20
on up. They can have backlit buttons, touch screens, color screens, voice
commands, and so on. A lot of it depends on what you really want out of a
remote control. The more you spend on your entertainment system, the more
you’ll probably spend on your remote control.
Here are examples of some of the neater remotes you can get:
 X10 Universal 5-in-1 Remote ($49, www.x10.com): This IR-based remote
not only controls your home theater system devices, but any X10-driven
devices as well (using RF for the X-10 stuff only). Want to turn down all
the lights prior to your “show”? No problem — connect them to X10 out-
lets and control them remotely with one button.
If you’re not familiar with X10 (the technology, as opposed to the com-
pany with the same name), it is a powerline control and automation tech-
nology, meaning it uses your electrical outlets. Essentially, X10 lets you
send commands to devices in your home (like light switches) that have
X10 communications capabilities built-in or added on via a small device
called an X10 module. X10 lets you turn things on and off and also lets
you dim lights, adjust fan speeds, and more!
 ATI Remote Wonder Plus ($39, www.ati.com): The ATI Remote Wonder
was originally packaged only with ATI’s great All-in-Wonder PC cards.
(See Chapter 8 for more All-in-Wonder info.) Now, you can use this
remote for any PC application. It is RF-based and comes with a small RF
receiver that plugs into any Windows-compatible PC’s USB port and
even works with OS X Macintosh computers. A great low-cost way to
control your PC, Remote Wonder Plus even offers precise “mouse con-
trol,” so you aren’t limited to just skipping between songs, but you can
use it just like a wireless mouse to use your PC’s cursor.
 Universal URC-300 ($169, www.universalremote.com): Universal’s
URC-300 is one of the least expensive remotes with a touch screen con-
troller. This touch screen allows you to create customized commands 
on the screen, so you can create macro commands with names that you
understand (like “Play a DVD”) and access them by simply pressing that
part of the LCD screen. This is a whole heck of a lot easier than trying to
hit all of the component commands individually, or even trying to remem-
ber which macro you want to use. (Many programmable remotes make
you press something like Macro + 1 to access a command — which is fine,
as long as you remember which macro number you’re looking for — but
it’s significantly more user friendly to be able to just press a touch screen
with the command you want labeled in plain English.)
223
Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater

 Philips Pronto line of remotes ($199 to over $1,000, www.pronto.
philips.com): Philips has a solid line of remote controls that have
defined the leading edge of home theater remotes in a lot of ways. The
$199 (list price) fully programmable and learning Pronto NEO is the
entry level to the Pronto range, but it has a lot of features, including a
big (but not color) touch screen, 4MB of memory, and the ability to pro-
gram your remote using your PC. Plus, with IR/RF capability, the unit
allows the user to control infrared devices in cabinets or in other rooms
with the simple addition of a Philips RF receiver, available as an option
for $149.
Of course, many more remotes are on the market. A great site to check out
remote control options is Remote Central (www.remotecentral.com). They
have great reviews and track the newest remotes on the market.
You can go universal with your remote in another sense: You can control
your home theater from anywhere in the home! We talk more about these
capabilities in Chapter 18.
Programming on Your Remote
We mention earlier that remotes are becoming learning-friendly and program-
mable. Nothing exemplifies this more than the $249 Logitech Harmony 880
Remote Control (www.logitech.com). The 880 helps you do more than con-
trol different devices; it helps you control different actions. Harmony’s remote
has an LCD screen and links to your PC or Mac via a USB connection to pro-
gram the remote to tie together multiple actions at once, in order.

Remotes for the rest of the family
Got kids? Try the weemote from Fobis ($24.95
from www.weemote.com). This is a remote
designed just for 3- to 8-year-olds, so you can
limit the channels they watch and make them
responsible for their own remotes (in other
words, keep their paws off yours). A typical
setup with a cable-ready TV takes about five
minutes. Fobis also has a cheaper weemote (the
weemote dV, $19.95) that’s especially made for
letting kids navigate interactive components of
DVDs or digital TV services. There’s even a
“Senior” weemote (the weemote SR, $24.95)
that’s designed for older folks who might not
have great eyesight or manual dexterity and
therefore can’t handle the 97 or so buttons on
the typical universal or learning remote.

Say you want to listen to a CD on your AudioReQuest CD server. You have to
turn on the TV, set it to video mode, turn on receiver one, set it to CD, turn on
receiver two, set it to CD, scroll down to your desired playlist, and press Play.
Harmony reduces this to a simple one-click task. It makes schedules and list-
ings available on your remote’s screen, and when you click it, all the requisite
actions on your CD player, receivers, TV set, and so on are done in one quick
series of signals from the remote to the devices. So Harmony is designed to
help you perform activities such as watch TV, play a CD, play a DVD, and so
on. That’s what we call click and play!
The really cool feature is Logitech’s on-line configuration tools. Simply plug 
the 880 into your Mac or PC with the supplied USB cable and go to Logitech’s
Harmony Web site. As you answer a series of questions on-screen about which
equipment you are trying to control and how it’s all hooked together, the
“logic” of your remote’s macros is automatically built for you. So you don’t
have to laboriously (okay, it’s not labor, but it is a real time waster), manually,
program a macro to (to pull an example out of our hats) “select receiver, select
menu, down arrow twice, select enter, up arrow once, select enter again,” or
whatever arcane combination of keystrokes will make your equipment do what
you want it to do. The Logitech database already “knows” all of this and simply
downloads the right instructions to your remote over the Internet. So you just
press the “DVD” command, and your remote will tell your DVD player, your
receiver, your TV, your . . . well, whatever . . . what to do. We like it when tech-
nology works for us, rather than the other way around.
Harmony is also a learning remote, and the latest version has added number
buttons, a docking and recharging station, and more. Très cool. For the price
and simplicity, every home theater owner should check out these Harmony
remotes.
For about $150 more, Logitech offers the Harmony 890, which adds RF remote
capabilities to control devices that are out of range of your IR signal.

Chapter 15: Remote Controlling Your Home Theater
Getting super fancy
A number of manufacturers build touchpad con-
trollers that are not just simple remote controls
but rather whole-home control systems, which
let you tap into lighting, HVAC (heating, ventila-
tion, and air conditioning), drapery controls,
alarm systems, automation systems, and more.
An example here is Crestron (www.crestron.
com), a company that develops incredibly cool
(and incredibly expensive) home automation,
control, and entertainment systems. This is the
stuff of MTV Cribs that can be found in those $20
million dream homes that we all wish to buy
when we win the lottery. Crestron rules the
upper end of touch screen options, as dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 21. Crestron’s color
touchpad systems are to die for, or at least
second mortgage for.

In this part . . .
S
o you know what stuff you need to buy to get into
home theater, and you may have even bought it. Well,
if you’re like us, buying stuff is a reflexive act. We could do
it in our sleep. The hard part is figuring out how to hook it
all up. Fear not — Part IV to the rescue.
First, we talk about the cables and connectors you can
use to connect the components of your home theater.
This is really an important section to read because in
many cases, you can use more than one kind of cable, and
there’s definitely a hierarchy. Some of these cables are
simply much better than others in terms of creating a
home theater that looks and sounds like it should.
Next, we talk you through the “insert tab A into slot A”
aspect of connecting a home theater. Now, remember that
this advice is generic. Home theater equipment vendors
are always coming up with their own little “modifications,”
making it hard for us to give concrete advice that applies
in every single situation. But we get you 99 percent of the
way there.
We also talk about how to do some nontraditional things
with your home theater. First, we discuss how to connect
your home theater components into a whole-home net-
work that lets you view, listen to, and control expensive
home theater gear anywhere in your home. We also give
you some details about how to hook up the home theater
PCs we talk about in Part II, so that you can bring the
power of the PC (and the Internet) to your home theater!

O
ne of the most puzzling, infuriating, blood-pressure-raising tasks in assem-
bling a home theater is finding the right kind, size, shape, and length of
cables. Someday in the not-so-distant future, if the copyright lawyers don’t get
in the way, there may be a single type of digital cable that can connect every-
thing together — this is the holy grail of the consumer electronics industry. All
that’s needed is some widespread agreement among all parties to make this
happen.
There’s hope here — a cable system called HDMI, capable of carrying both
audio and video, is becoming very popular. (Those in the know know that
HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface.) It won’t solve the prob-
lem for your older gear, but it’s becoming almost standard on new equipment.
We discuss HDMI in the section titled “Employing digital video connections.”
We may soon see an even better solution to the cabling problem: no cabling
at all. The day is coming when inexpensive yet high-performance wireless
systems will let you connect your components together without worrying
about which plug goes where — or which throw rug to buy to hide that tangle
of speaker wire.
We can dream of the day when complex cabling is no longer necessary, but it
has not yet arrived. In this chapter, we discuss the different kinds of cables
required to hook up the common components in a home theater as well as
those needed to share your theater with the rest of the house. In many cases,
there’s more than one way to hook one component to another; we tell you
which cable is best.

230
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Working with Short Run Cables
Most of the connections you make in a home theater are short runs — that is,
connections between components that are sitting just a few feet from each
other (or are at least in the same room). The cables you use for these connec-
tions are typically called interconnects. Later in this chapter, we talk about the
long run cables that make up the infrastructure of a whole-home audio and
video network.
Choosing quality cables
We should take a moment here to talk about cable quality — right up front, 
in the beginning of the chapter. You can get audio cable (or most any kind of
cable) for free in the box when you buy new equipment. Or you can pay liter-
ally $1,000 a foot for the double-secret-mojo, cold-fusion-reactor-type cables.
In case you think we’re kidding, we’re not. (Well, we are about the cold-fusion
part.) Some people pay thousands of dollars for each cable in their system.
Our take on the matter is this: Don’t use the free el cheapo cables that came
in the box — because you do get what you pay for — but don’t pay $1,000+
per cable either unless you are both rich and absolutely convinced that you
can hear an improvement in your sound or see an improvement in your
video. There’s a happy medium. Bottom line: Yes, there is a difference in
cables, but no, you don’t have to pay a ton for good cables.
Look for cables that use oxygen-free copper (OFC) conductors and have gold-
plated surfaces on the jacks. Oxygen-free copper is a purer form of copper,
and the gold-plated surfaces resist corrosion. Use the shortest run of cable
possible because the longer that audio signal travels over the cable, the more
likely the signal will be audibly degraded by interference or attenuation (the
weakening of the signal as it travels over any cable).
Dozens of companies make high-quality cables at a wide range of prices. Right
off the bat, we can name Monster Cable (www.monstercable.com), Kimber
Kable (www.kimber.com), and AudioQuest (www.audioquest.com). (By the
way, there are so many good cables out on the market, please don’t feel like
our short list is anywhere near exhaustive. We could have filled a page with
company names.)
Joining the RCA mania
The most common type of connector in any home theater is the standard
analog audio interconnect. Traditionally, these cables came in pairs for two-
channel (stereo) audio connections, but in the realm of the home theater,
with its multiple surround sound channels, cables don’t always work in neat
pairs. You may find yourself using these cables individually (like the cable

that connects a subwoofer to the receiver or controller) or in big bunches
(like the six cables that connect an SACD [Super Audio CD] or DVD-Audio
player to the receiver).
Audio interconnects use a standardized jack known as an RCA jack, which is
nice because any audio interconnect with RCA jacks will plug into any corre-
sponding RCA plug on a piece of A/V equipment. Figure 16-1 shows an RCA
plug on a stereo (dual) pair of audio interconnects.
If you go shopping for audio interconnects, you’ll find a huge array of differ-
ent cable constructions. The typical audio interconnect is a coaxial cable,
which means that it has two electrical conductors surrounded by a shielded
jacket within the cable. This jacket is called shielded because it is designed to
keep stray electromagnetic energy from getting into the conductors and caus-
ing interference with the audio signal. But you’ll find a lot of variation out
there, and some cables are unshielded but twisted. (Twisting has a similar
effect to shielding — due to the black art of physics, twisted cables can
cancel out interferences.)
Connecting your speakers
Another cable that you’ll find in every home theater (except for those that
use active loudspeaker systems, which we discuss in Chapter 12) is the
speaker cable. Speaker cables connect the outputs of the power amplifier or
the amplifier section of the receiver to the speaker. These cables carry the
high-powered electrical currents required to move the internal components
of the speaker (the magnets that move the drivers, as described in Chapter
12). You need one pair of speaker cables for each speaker in your system
(except for the subwoofer if it’s an active system — which most are — and
which uses an analog audio interconnect cable instead).

Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

Some expensive speaker systems can use two pairs of speaker wires per
speaker. These systems are either biwired or biamped:
 Biwired: Two sets of speaker wire connect to the same output on the
receiver or power amplifier, and you plug them into two sets of termi-
nals on the speaker itself.
 Biamped: The speaker uses two separate amplifiers — one for the low-
frequency drivers and one for the high-frequency drivers.
Biwiring is one of those “audiophile” tricks that most people don’t really hear.
If it works for you, and you have speakers with such a setup, by all means use
it. But for us, it’s just not worth the expense of the extra set of speaker cables.
Because they typically go for longer distances (especially in the case of 
surround speakers) and carry more electrical current than interconnects,
speaker cables are considerably beefier and thicker than interconnects. 
The thickness of speaker cables (or the conductors within, to be precise) 
is referred to as gauge (using the standard AWG, or American Wire Gauge,
system). The lower the gauge, the thicker the conductors.
Thicker conductors have less electrical resistance to the current flowing
through them. Too much resistance is a bad thing (it can alter the audio
signal), and the longer the cable, the greater the resistance the signal faces
while traveling over the cable. We recommend cables of no higher than 16-
gauge thickness, and prefer 14-gauge cables. For longer runs of 40 feet or
more, such as runs to surround sound speakers in a large room, we recom-
mend moving down to 12-gauge cables if they fit your budget.
If you want to hide your speaker cables in the wall (or if you’re running
speaker cables through the wall for a multizone audio system), you need to
get cables that are specially designed for this purpose and that meet electri-
cal code requirements. You should choose cables that have been certified for
this purpose by Underwriters Laboratories (UL-certified) and that meet the
CL3 specification (which relates to the insulation on the wires and helps pre-
vent fires — a good thing in our opinion).
Unlike audio interconnects, which share the common RCA connector, you
have a ton of connector choices when it comes to speaker cables (these con-
nectors are sometimes called terminations). The most bare-bones approach is
to just use the bare wire itself (stripped of any insulation), but we highly rec-
ommend you don’t do this. You typically don’t get as good a connection, and
the bare wire ends can corrode over time, making the connection even worse
(and impacting your sound quality).
232
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

You’ll see three main types of connectors (besides the bare wire) on the
market:
 Pin connectors: These look like they sound — a straight or angled pin 
at the end of the wire (though it’s not sharp, so you won’t put your eye
out). These work best with the spring-loaded clip type of speaker con-
nectors, which you find on less expensive receivers and speakers. Pin
connectors also work with the preferred five-way binding posts found on
better models. (We talk about five-way binding posts in Chapter 12.)
 Spade lugs: These U-shaped connectors fit behind the screws on a five-
way binding post (you slide the open part of the U over the post and
then screw down the plastic nut). Spade lugs can provide the tightest,
most reliable connection you can get (because of that screwing down).
Some spade lugs go beyond the “U” shape and are shaped like three-
quarters of a circle, to hook around your binding post. These “hooked”
connectors tend to be even more secure.
 Banana plugs: If you squint really hard, these plugs may actually look
like bananas, but they look more like pin connectors that are fat in the
middle. By bowing out in the middle, they provide a tight fit into the
binding post. Banana plugs come in single and dual configurations. The
dual variety is just two banana plugs (one for each wire in the pair of
speaker wires) stuck together in the same housing.
Figure 16-2 shows the pin, spade lug, and banana plug, and Figure 16-3 shows
a five-way binding post.
Although the spade lug provides the ultimate in speaker wire connections, we
think the banana plug provides a connection that’s very close in quality. The
banana plug is also much easier to use because the banana just slides into
the binding post (nothing to tighten or adjust).
Your choice of speaker cable connectors is largely driven by the receiver and
speaker choices you make. While ideally manufacturers would create gear
that could accept any of these connectors, the real world of designing and
manufacturing A/V gear often makes that difficult. When you look at the sheer
number of speaker connections that sprout on the back of a 7.1-channel
receiver (at least 14 individual connectors just for the speakers — not to 
mention all of the audio and video interconnects), there’s often just not enough
room to accept many of the larger connectors (like spade lugs). When you’re
purchasing speaker cables, try to be sure that the connectors will fit — and
make sure you can return the cables if they simply won’t fit on your gear.
233
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

Using digital audio interconnects
With the advent of computer-chip-laden receivers and DVD players, home
theater has moved home A/V gear into the digital age. True, CD players 
have been digital for years, but for the majority of people, all the digital stuff
happened inside the CD. The connections between the CD player and the
receiver were all analog. Surround sound (specifically digital surround sound
systems, such as Dolby Digital and DTS) has made the digital interconnect
commonplace.

234
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

As we mention throughout the book, digital audio interconnects (to connect
DVD players, HDTV tuners, video game consoles, and more to the A/V
receiver or controller) are divided into two main types: coaxial and optical
(or Toslink).
The HDMI connection (discussed later in this chapter, in the section called
“Employing digital video connections”) is primarily used as a method for
making digital video connections, but HDMI can also carry up to eight chan-
nels of digital audio. As A/V receivers begin to include HDMI connections
(and a growing number are), you’ll be able to use a single cable to connect a
source device like a DVD player or set-top box to your receiver, and also a
single cable to connect the receiver to your display. Home theater cable nir-
vana is within sight! (At least for new equipment that includes HDMI.)
Coaxial digital interconnects
The coaxial interconnect looks an awful lot like a single (mono) audio inter-
connect. It has standard RCA jacks on both ends and a coaxial cable between
them. Put the analog audio and coaxial interconnects side by side on a table
(unlabeled of course), and you really can’t tell them apart. But the conduc-
tors inside coaxial cables are of a different construction that’s designed to
handle the higher frequencies of digital signals. You shouldn’t use standard
audio interconnects in place of a coaxial digital cable. It’s tough to explain the
difference in sound you may experience if you use the wrong kind of cable
here, but if your digital audio just doesn’t sound right, check to see whether
you have the correct digital interconnect hooked up.
Coaxial digital interconnects are not the only example of cables that use RCA
plugs and look like audio interconnects but are not. Both the composite and
the component video cables we discuss shortly also appear to be identical to
audio interconnects, but in fact use different internal conductors and designs.
Also keep in mind that the term “coax” is typically used to describe the cables
used to connect antennas, cable TV feeds, and satellite dishes to your home
theater. That type of coax (using the “F connector) is a completely different
kettle of fish from a coaxial digital audio cable.
Optical digital interconnects
The Toslink optical connector uses fiber optics instead of copper cabling and
carries the digital signal as pulses of light instead of as an electrical signal.
The connector on a Toslink interconnect, viewed head-on, looks like a nice
little house in suburbia — except most houses don’t have a laser flashing out
of the side of them. (Well at least ours don’t — we won’t presume to speak for
you.) Figure 16-4 shows the Toslink cable connector.
235
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

The female Toslink connector (on your receiver or DVD player or wherever
you’re plugging a Toslink into) is usually covered by a little removable dust
cap. If you don’t take off this cap, you’re going to curse like a sailor trying to
plug in that cable.
Some folks argue strongly either for Toslink or for coaxial digital audio con-
nectors — we don’t have any qualms recommending them both. Our basic
advice is to use whichever is available to you — if they’re both available,
they’re both equally good, assuming you don’t use cables that fell off the
back of a speeding van in your neighborhood.
Using analog video connections
The majority of video connections in a home theater are made using analog
connections (though an increasing number of devices can use the newer digi-
tal video interconnects we discuss in the following section). You’ll find three
types of short run analog video connections in a home theater.
To truly understand the differences between the types of connections, you
need to first understand what kinds of signals these cables carry. There are
two components to a video signal — the luminance and the chrominance. The
luminance provides the video display with the brightness information that
determines which parts of the screen are darker or lighter. The chrominance
adds information about what color each segment of the screen should be.
There is a definite hierarchy among video connections. One is visibly worse
(in terms of picture quality) than the other two, and of the two superior
methods, one is better (though not as significantly) than the other. In ascend-
ing order (worst to best), these connection types are as follows:
 Composite video: Both luminance and chrominance are combined into a
single signal. The comb filter inside the display (discussed in Chapter 13)
separates these two components and sends them to the appropriate
internal circuitry.
Figure 16-4:

236
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

 S-Video: In S-Video, luminance and chrominance are separated onto two
separate signal paths, so the signal can bypass the comb filter in the TV.
This usually results in a much clearer picture, with more defined colors
and images.
 Component video: Component video separates the signal even further,
providing one path for luminance information, and then providing two
separate paths for chrominance information. Component video connec-
tions can be further enhanced in a wideband component video connec-
tion, which allows the higher frequencies needed for HDTV to travel
from the source (such as an HDTV tuner) to the HDTV monitor.
So the big difference between composite (the lower-quality video signal), 
S-Video, and component video connections is the fact that the better connec-
tions carry luminance and chrominance information separately. Why is this 
a big deal? After all, the display does have a comb filter to take care of that
problem. Well, here’s a dirty little secret: Comb filters do an imperfect job 
of separating these two signals and can leave visible artifacts in your picture.
You want the sharpest, most colorful picture you can get, don’t you?
In some cases, you might not choose the highest-quality connection available
to you. We talk about such cases in Chapter 17, when we discuss hooking up
your home theater.
Both component and composite cables use standard RCA connectors and
bear a striking resemblance to the analog audio interconnect (and the digital
coaxial interconnect, for that matter). Composite video cables are loners
(you need just one), and component video cables travel in small packs of
three (often labeled Y, Pr, and Pb).
Composite video cables are usually color-coded yellow (that is to say, the
connector usually has a yellow ring around it, or the rubber boot around 
the connector is yellow). Component video cables are also typically color-
coded with red, green, and blue connectors.
S-Video is an unmistakable beast, with its own special connector (the S-Video
connector of course). This connector has four small pins that correspond
with four small holes on the S-Video plug on your gear. Figure 16-5 shows an
S-Video connector.
S-Video connectors can be a real pain in the butt to line up and connect. One
set of pins is slightly more widely spaced than the other (the bottom ones are
farther apart). If you’re really killing yourself, check to see that you aren’t
pushing this cable in upside down. A little plastic doohickey keeps you from
really messing things up, but bent pins are far from unknown to first-time 
S-Video users.
237
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

Employing digital video connections
The consumer electronics industry (in association with the content providers)
has been working overtime to develop some digital video interconnection sys-
tems that satisfy the following requirements:
 Preserve the digital signal: The video connection systems we discuss in
the previous section are all analog systems. They carry analog video sig-
nals, not digital ones. Nothing is inherently wrong with analog connec-
tions, but they are more susceptible to interferences and other losses of
signal quality when compared to digital connections. And in the case of
digital signals (such as HDTV and other ATSC digital television broad-
casts), there’s really no reason to convert to analog until the very last
minute (inside of the display itself). As Dick Vitale would say, “Keep it
digital, baby!”
 Minimize cables: Some of these analog connections (particularly com-
ponent video) also require multiple cables per connection. So if you
want to connect the component video output of your HDTV tuner to
your receiver and then to your display, you need six cables (three for
each link). Add a DVD player using component video into the mix, and
you have six more cables. Pretty soon, you have spaghetti. And this
doesn’t even include the cables you’ll require for audio!

Part IV: Putting It All Together 

 Provide copy protection: These analog connections don’t have any inher-
ent copy protection systems. If there’s one thing that content providers
(movie and television studios) want to prevent, it’s people copying their
content. They don’t even really want to let you make copies for personal
use, such as copying CSI when you’re out of town on business so that you
can watch it after you come home.
We discuss the most common digital video connection options in the follow-
ing sections.
FireWire
One of the first systems for digital video crossed over from the computer
industry. FireWire, which is also called IEEE 1394 or i.LINK, depending on who’s
talking, was originally developed by Apple Computer for connecting peripheral
devices to Macintosh computers. Companies such as Sony picked up on the
technology and began incorporating FireWire into their camcorders and PCs,
and FireWire grew from there. (The FireWire in camcorders is often called DV.)
Some HDTV tuners and HDTV-ready displays include FireWire connections,
as do a few other devices (such as JVC’s D-VHS), but as we write, FireWire
appears to be becoming less common as a means of connecting HDTV
devices together.
So why do we mention it? Well, for starters, you can still buy HDTV systems
that use FireWire. Additionally, FireWire is beginning to become more common
in the audio side of the home theater. The DVD Forum (a coalition of compa-
nies that helps develop the DVD standard) has recently approved FireWire as
a connection method for the audio output of DVD-Audio players. When these
players (and compatible receivers or controllers) hit the market, you’ll be able
to replace those six analog audio interconnects with a single cable. That will
be nice!
Although DVI and particularly HDMI, FireWire’s biggest competitors in the
digital video connection world, appear to be winning the war of digital video
interconnects, battles are still being fought, and the tide may turn. In fact, a
new group called HANA (High-definition Audio-Video Networking Alliance,
www.hanaalliance.org) was formed to create yet another set of standards
for connecting your A/V gear together, and FireWire is a big part of that
system. So don’t count FireWire out completely yet. But don’t be surprised if
you don’t see FireWire anywhere in your home theater either!
Digital Visual Interface
One reason that FireWire never really took off in the world of home theater
was the success of its competitor, DVI (Digital Visual Interface). DVI is
239
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

another technology adopted from the computer world, where it was origi-
nally developed as a means of connecting computers to digital LCD screens
and projectors. Along the way, DVI picked up a strong copy protection
system called HDCP (discussed in Chapter 13) and became a favorite of the
HDTV industry.
HDCP makes DVI a relatively dumb connection — all it does is send video in
one direction (for example, from the tuner to the display), and HDCP can
limit your ability to make a digital copy of what you’re watching. Figure 16-6
shows a DVI connector.
Not all devices with a DVI connector incorporate HDCP. For example, LCD
computer monitors may use DVI without HDCP. If you connect an HDCP-
enabled HDTV tuner to a non-HDCP display using a DVI cable, you can’t get 
a full HDTV signal. Instead, the signal is converted to a lower resolution.
DVI is a great way to make digital video connections, and it is available on
many displays and a number of source devices (like HDTV tuners), but it is
rapidly being replaced by HDMI, which not only uses a smaller and simpler
connector but can also carry digital audio signals.
The state of the art in digital video connections: HDMI
The latest and greatest in digital video (and audio) connections is the HDMI
cable. HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, and you can find
out more about the technology at the HDMI Web site at www.hdmi.org.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 

HDMI is being included in a variety of devices these days, including HDTVs,
DVD players (both the current generation of DVD players and the forthcoming
high-definition Blu-ray and HD-DVD players), cable and satellite set-top
boxes, and Media Center Edition PCs, and it is even expected to show up in
the Sony PlayStation 3 gaming console (which hasn’t hit the market as we
write).
What’s so great about HDMI? Well, a few things:
 It’s all-digital. Like DVI and FireWire, HDMI provides an all-digital path
for your standard and high-definition video signals.
 It’s high-bandwidth. HDMI can support data signals as fast as 5Gb per
second. That means it can handle HDTV with plenty of room to spare. (In
fact, HDTV uses less than half of this bandwidth — so the HDTV signals
don’t have to be compressed.) FireWire, by comparison, tops out at
400Mb per second (there is an 800Mb per second variant, but it’s not
very common) — less than 1⁄12 of the bandwidth.
 It can support all variants of HDTV. 720p, 1080i, even 1080p can run
over an HDMI cable.
 It can carry up to eight channels of digital audio. So a single HDMI
cable can carry your HDTV and your 7.1-channel surround sound.
Nothing like reducing the tangle of cables behind your system, huh?
As you shop for HDMI cables, you might consider consulting a cardiologist
simply because the “big name” HDMI cables in your average electronics store
are incredibly expensive and may cause your heart to palpitate. Don’t fear,
though — HDMI cables don’t have to be super-expensive. In fact, certified
HDMI cables can be relatively cheap, and there are many good on-line sources.
For example, Pat recently installed some HDMI cables in his wall that were
about one-fifth the price of those at his local retail store, and they work great!
We highly recommend that you spend a few moments perusing some of the
other sources of information we discuss in Chapter 23 (like AVS Forum) and
see what the home theater enthusiasts are using and where they’re getting it
on-line. You’ll probably get a great bargain.
As long as your HDMI cable runs are less than 10 meters, you can buy one of
these inexpensive cables and expect excellent results. When you get past 10
meters (that’s over 30 feet — a long way!), we recommend that you consult a
specialist because you might need some special active components to boost
the signal level. But we’re confident that most folks won’t need to go more
than 30 feet!

Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

We think HDMI is the way to go. If you’re shopping for a new TV, a new
receiver, or a new DVD player, or choosing an HDTV set-top box or satellite
receiver, go with HDMI if you can. HDMI can provide the highest quality video
signal and throws your multichannel surround sound audio in on the same
cable. You really can’t go wrong here!
HDMI is fully backward compatible with DVI. What that means is that you can
interconnect HDMI and DVI devices. So you can connect, for example, a DVI
connector on your HDTV cable set-top box to an HDMI input on your new
plasma (or vice versa). Keep in mind that such connections will carry only
video signals — DVI doesn’t support audio. If you’re buying all new gear, it’s
best to choose HDMI all around, but if you’re upgrading, the good news is
that HDMI won’t strand your investment in DVI-equipped gear. All you need 
is an inexpensive (about $20) adapter, or you can easily find HDMI-to-DVI
cables, which have an HDMI connector on one end and a DVI connector on
the other. We love it when something new doesn’t make us have to throw
away our old gear — don’t you?
Working with Long Run Cables
When you start thinking about connecting your home theater to the rest of
your home (perhaps to share a video source device with TVs in other rooms),
you will run into a new set of cables. These long run cables are designed to
minimize signal loss and get your audio and video to any spot in the house.
Although you can distribute audio and video around the home in many ways,
the three most common ways are the following:
 RG6 coaxial cabling for video: This cable (which we describe later in
this chapter) carries video signals (and the associated audio tracks)
from antennas, satellite dishes, and cable TV feeds from the street. With
devices called modulators, you can actually create in-house TV channels
and use this cable to share your own video sources with other TVs in
the house.
 Speaker cabling for whole-home audio: We discuss speaker wires (appro-
priately rated for in-wall use) in the section, “Connecting your speakers,”
earlier in this chapter. You can use this same speaker wire to connect a
multizone receiver (or a separate whole-home audio system) to speakers
throughout the house.
 Category 5e (CAT-5e) or Category 6 (CAT-6) network cabling: This is
the cable used for computer networks — the stuff you put in your walls
if you are creating a whole-home network. With the appropriate gear on
the ends of these cables (we discuss this in Chapter 18), you can use
this cable to carry audio and video signals.
242
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Going with RG6
Coaxial cable (usually just called coax) is a metallic cable most often used for
transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals, such as broadband television video
and radio signals. Coaxial cable contains two conductors, or axes, to carry
data. A layer of dielectric insulating material surrounds a single, center con-
ductor. The other conductor is a metal shield, usually made of a braided
metallic wiring, that goes around the dielectric (insulating) layer. The outer-
most layer of coax cable is an insulating jacket. The connectors on an RG6
cable are known as F connectors.
You may encounter coaxial cables labeled RG6QS or RG6 Quad Shield, which
means that the cable has additional shielding beneath the cable jacket —
four layers, as the quad implies. These layers provide additional protection
against interference from external sources. Because of this extra shielding,
we recommend you use Quad Shield coax. It doesn’t cost a lot more, and it’s
worth the investment.
CAT-5e/CAT-6 cabling systems
If you’ve ever spent any time building, designing, or just using a computer
network, you’ve encountered CAT-5e or CAT-6 cabling — often generically
called Ethernet cables. (These are two very similar types of data cables —
CAT-5e is the most common, so we refer to it below, but both will work just
fine.) CAT-5e is a type of UTP (unshielded twisted pair) copper cabling and
can be used for phones, computer networks, home automation networks, and
audio/video distribution systems. CAT-5e cables typically consist of four
pairs of wire (eight total conductors) wrapped in a single jacket. The ends of
CAT-5e cables are terminated in connectors known as RJ-45 jacks, which look
exactly like the common RJ-11 phone jack, only wider.
CAT-5e cabling can be used to connect your home theater to your computer
LAN (local area network) and through this LAN to the Internet. For example,
CAT-5e connectors are commonly found on MP3 servers, PVRs, and increas-
ingly on audio source devices that are designed to play back Internet radio
stations or MP3 files located on a computer in your house. CAT-5e cabling may
also be used to connect the A/V source components in your home theater to
other rooms in the house. (We discuss systems that do this in Chapter 19.)
There is actually a range of category-rated UTP cables (for example, CAT-3
cabling is often used for telephone wiring). CAT-6 is the current “top-of-the-
line” UTP cabling, suitable for very fast computer networks, but CAT-5e cable
is the most common for home use, and is more than adequate for your
home’s wiring.
243
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

Each piece of a CAT-5e system (the cables themselves, the RJ-45 jacks, and so
on) is subject to the CAT-5e rating system. If you use CAT-5e, make sure all
the pieces and parts are rated CAT-5e. The “weakest link in the chain” rule
applies here. Any piece that’s rated below CAT-5e brings the whole system
down to that lower rating. Many A/V-over-UTP systems require CAT-5e and
don’t work well on identical-looking but lower-rated cables. All CAT-5e cables
and connectors will be clearly marked with a label of some sort, so just read
the fine print (on the cable itself) to be sure.
Identifying Other Cable Odds and Ends
We end this chapter with a hodgepodge listing of other cables and connec-
tors that may show up in your home theater. These connection systems are
less common than the ones discussed in preceding sections, but none of
them is a complete stranger to the world of home theater. This is particularly
true if you are hooking your home theater into a whole-home network or
when you are connecting PCs and other computer-like devices (such as PVRs
and MP3 servers) into your home theater.
Wireless connections
Wireless networking technologies have made a huge splash in the computer
networking world — everyone, it seems, has gone crazy for a system called
802.11 or Wi-Fi (a type of wireless computer LAN). (Read our books Smart
Homes For Dummies and Wireless Home Networking For Dummies, both pub-
lished by Wiley Publishing, Inc., for a ton of information about this technol-
ogy — and you Mac folks might want to check out Airport & Mac Wireless
Networking For Dummies, by Michael Cohen, as well.)
As more people begin to use PCs and the Internet in their home theaters, this
technology is increasingly moving from the computer world to the consumer
electronics world. Many manufacturers, such as NETGEAR (www.netgear.
com) and D-Link (www.dlink.com), are creating devices called Wi-Fi Ethernet
Bridges specifically for home entertainment/home theater gear. These bridges
make it easy to connect Internet-capable home theater gear to your home’s
Wi-Fi network with the help of an Ethernet port. (Ethernet is the common
computer network that uses CAT-5e cabling and RJ-45 jacks.) For about $100,
you can buy one of these bridges and use a short length of CAT-5e cabling to
connect it to your PVR (personal video recorder), MP3 server, home theater
PC, or even your gaming console (such as Xbox or PlayStation 2). The bridge
then connects wirelessly (using radio waves) to your DSL or cable modem
through a device called an access point.
In Chapter 10, we discuss a number of Wi-Fi enabled systems that let you get
content into your home theater.
244
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

RS-232
If you’ve ever connected a modem to an older PC, you’ve probably used an
RS-232 connector and not even known it. RS-232 is a standard computer 
communications system that’s more commonly known as a serial connection.
Until the advent of the USB system (discussed in the following section), RS-232
was the standard connection for modems, handheld computer cradles, and
many other PC peripheral devices.
In the home theater world, RS-232 is not used for carrying audio and video. It
is, however, often used for connecting A/V components to automation and
control systems (such as the Crestron systems we discuss in Chapter 15).
You can also find RS-232 ports on the back of many advanced A/V receivers,
where they can be used to connect the receiver to a PC for upgrading the
software system within the receiver.
USB
USB (or Universal Serial Bus) has pretty much replaced RS-232 in the PC
world. These days, most printers, external modems, handheld computers,
portable MP3 players, and other PC peripheral devices connect to PCs via USB.
In the home theater world, USB can be found on the back of many computer-
like source devices (such as MP3 servers and PVRs). USB has not yet
replaced RS-232 for connections to automation and control systems, but
probably will eventually.
The most common use for USB in a home theater is in conjunction with a 
Wi-Fi system. You can outfit source devices that can connect to the Internet
with a USB Wi-Fi network adapter. This adapter enables you to connect back
to the access point and out to the Internet. USB is also used for remote con-
trol connections for PCs. The remote control receiver for the PC connects to
the PC via a USB cable.
There are multiple types of USB devices out there. (With more than 1 billion
USB-enabled devices in use around the world, that’s probably no surprise.)
The latest and greatest variant of USB is USB 2.0 High-speed, which supports
data transfers at speeds of up to 480 Mbits per second. The older and slower
USB 1.1 standard really doesn’t cut it for home theater use, as it can barely
handle audio signals and just plain can’t do high-quality video.
You can also find a few A/V receivers (like JVC’s RX-D201S — www.jvc.com)
that have a USB connection that lets you connect to a nearby PC to feed digi-
tal audio signals (like MP3 files) from the PC to the receiver without using one
of the media adapter devices we discuss in Chapter 10.
245
Chapter 16: Home Theater Cable Basics

IR connections
In Chapter 18, we talk about ways that you can connect your home theater to
speakers and displays in other parts of your home by using a whole-home
entertainment network. As we discuss earlier in this chapter, you use RG6
coaxial cable, speaker wire, and/or CAT-5e cabling to carry your audio and
video around the house. There’s one other piece to this whole-home puzzle,
however. You need some sort of system for controlling remote devices when
you are watching them (or listening to them) in a different part of the house.
If the phone rings, you want to be able to turn down the music or pause the
movie.
Most A/V systems use IR (infrared) systems for their remote controls. IR is a
great system, but because it uses a beam of light to carry control signals, it
can’t penetrate walls (unless you have a glass house, we suppose). So you
need some sort of wired system that can carry IR signals from remote loca-
tions back to your home theater. (You can also find wireless alternatives from
companies such as X10 — www.x10.com.) You can set up an infrared system
in four ways:
 IR cabling: Many home networking vendors sell cables specially designed
for carrying IR signals from remote locations back to the home theater.
 CAT-5e cabling: If you’re using CAT-5e cabling for audio and video distrib-
ution (using some of the systems we discuss in Chapter 19), you’ll find
that these systems have a built-in capability to carry IR signals for remote
controls. If you’re not using one of these systems but have put CAT-5e
cabling in your walls when building your home, you can use extra
(unused) CAT-5e cables in place of the IR cabling we just mentioned.
 RG6 coaxial cabling: Using special devices called IR injectors (available
from vendors such as ChannelPlus, www.channelplus.com), you can
carry IR signals over the RG6 coax that you use for distributing cable or
broadcast antenna TV signals.
You can’t use an IR injector on the RG6 cables used to connect a DSS
dish to DSS receivers.
 Proprietary systems: If you opt to install a high-end automation system,
such as those from Crestron (www.crestron.com), you need to use
special proprietary cables from the manufacturer. For example, Crestron
uses its own special cable called CrestNet.

Hooking Up Your A/V System
In This Chapter
 Planning your gear layout
 Hiding wires
 Connecting to the receiver
 Making the video connection
 Adding PCs and gaming systems
 Powering your system
You’ve picked a room, collected all your A/V gear, opened the boxes, and
oohed and aahed at your shiny new stuff. Now it’s time to get down to
the work of hooking up your home theater. At first glance, this can seem like
a daunting task. You have a lot of cables and connectors to deal with, and
even experienced home theater folks may find the back of an A/V receiver
confusing at first. The key is to take a methodical approach. With a few key
concepts in mind, hooking up an A/V system can be easy and even fun!
In this chapter, we talk about where the various pieces and parts of an A/V
system should go in your home theater and how they should be connected to
each other. However, the advice we give in this chapter is generic. Although
the majority of home theater components connect in a similar fashion with
identical cables and connectors, there are always a few differences among dif-
ferent brands and models. For example, what we call CD Audio In might be
labeled CD Line In or even Aux In on your receiver. For the exact terms and
procedures that apply to your system, you need to read your manual.
Planning the Room Layout
After you’ve read those oh-so-fun manuals, you might think it’s time to start
plugging away. The temptation is to get things hooked up and working. You
want to watch a movie right now, admit it . . . so would we. But by devoting a
few minutes to planning out your next steps, you can make the process easier
and get better results when the time comes to watch and listen to your system.

At a minimum, your home theater has six speakers (including the subwoofer).
Each of these speakers plays a role in creating the illusion of being “in the
action” when you watch movies or shows (or listen to multichannel audio on
DVD-A or SACD). So you have to get the speakers in the right spots relative to
your listening position. Incorrectly positioning your speakers creates gaps in
the sound field that surrounds you. These gaps can be distracting or down-
right annoying and can also cause room interactions that reduce the fidelity
of the audio you are re-creating.
No matter what you do, your speakers are going to interact with your room,
creating echoes and reflections that have some impact on the sound. The key
is to reduce the negative effects of these interactions and, instead, use them
to your advantage.
Getting the front speakers in place
The front speakers — left, right, and center — provide the bulk of the sound
you listen to while watching a movie. One of the key jobs of these front speak-
ers is to provide a realistic reproduction of dialogue — you want people in
the middle of the display to sound like they’re right in front of you, and those
on the left and right to sound like that’s where they are. Proper placement of
these three front speakers is essential in creating this effect and minimizing
any gaps in the speakers’ coverage (so when dialogue moves from side to
side, it does so seamlessly). Keep the following points in mind when setting
up your front speakers:
 Set up your center channel speaker first. The placement of the left and
right speakers is dependent upon the position of your center speaker.
 Make sure the front surface of the center channel speaker is flush
with the display. Most center channel speakers are designed to be
placed directly on top of the display. Keep the front surfaces of both
flush with each other to minimize reflections. If your equipment physi-
cally permits, you might try to get the front of the speaker (the baffle) in
front of the surface of the screen. (This is really hard to pull off in the
real world, which is why we recommend just making them flush.)
If you have a wall-mounted display (like a flat-panel plasma or LCD TV),
you might have a hard time getting your center channel speaker flush
with the display (unless you’re using wall-mounted speakers especially
designed for such applications — which are becoming quite popular these
days). Don’t sweat it; just try to keep the front of your center channel
relatively close to the same vertical plane as the front of your display —
don’t stick it too far out in front if you can avoid it.
248
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

 Keep the right and left channel speakers the same distance from your
listening position as the front speaker. Some people place the three
front speakers in a straight line across the front of the room. This actu-
ally makes the center speaker closer to you than the others, meaning
that sounds from the center speaker reach you sooner than sounds from
the others. Instead of a line, the front speakers should form an arc in
front of you, in which each speaker is the same distance from your pri-
mary viewing position (or the middle of the viewing position, such as
the center of a couch or the middle of a group of seats).
If you’re using wall-mount speakers with a wall-mounted flat panel,
you’re not going to be able to do this. Again, don’t sweat it; it’s not a
huge deal, as long as you take the time to “teach” your receiver where
your speakers are when you configure it. Because these speakers will be
a bit farther away from you than the center channel when you’re sitting
directly in front of the display, you’ll simply have the receiver introduce
a bit of delay in the signals sent to these speakers, so the sound arrives
at your ears at the right time.
 Toe-in the left and right speakers. The front panels of the left and right
speakers should be placed so that they are aimed directly at (or immedi-
ately behind) your seating position. Many wall mounts allow you to
angle the speakers this way.
Some speakers are designed such that their front panels are already
toed-in when the speakers are placed parallel to the wall. Check the
manual that comes with your speakers to see if there are any specific
recommendations on toe-in.
 Place the left and right speakers at a 45- to 60-degree angle from the
listening position. Start off with the speakers at the wider angle. Place
each speaker 30 degrees to the right or left of the center speaker from
your viewing position. If you find, while listening to movie soundtracks,
that sounds seem unnatural and too widely spaced, you can move the
right and left speakers closer to the screen. Conversely, if it’s hard to 
distinguish right from left from most seating positions, spread them a 
bit farther apart. When you do so, maintain the arc we just mentioned.
 Place the speakers’ tweeters at or near the viewers’ ear level. Keep in
mind the seated height of your viewers in the seating you’ve selected
and adjust your speakers accordingly when selecting stands or wall
mounting. Even if you have floorstanding speakers, you can buy small
stands to raise the height, if necessary. If your center speaker is above
you (maybe you put it on top of a gigantic RPTV), you can at least aim it
down toward your listening position. Our technical editor (who’s a
genius at this stuff) likes to use rubber wedge-shaped doorstops under
the backside of the center speaker to do this aiming.
249
Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

Dealing with surrounds
Many people think of their surround sound speakers as their rear speakers.
Indeed, many receivers label the surround outputs as Rear, so people imagine
that these speakers need to be along the back wall, behind the listening posi-
tion. This isn’t always the case — particularly with the bipole or dipole sur-
round speakers, which are the most common kinds (we prefer dipoles).
5.1-channel surround sound
For 5.1-channel surround sound, we recommend you place bipole or dipole
surround speakers along the side walls (preferably mounted on the side
wall). Position them even to or slightly behind your home theater seating,
and about 2 feet above the listeners’ seated ear level. If you are using direct-
radiating speakers for your surrounds, the best placement is behind the lis-
teners, aimed so that they radiate (face, in other words) toward the back
wall. That might sound a bit counter-intuitive, but if you face them directly
toward the listening position, you don’t get the diffuse surround sound that
you’re looking for.
If your room layout supports it, you should place your surround speakers on
either side of your primary viewing/listening position so that they are each
within a 90 to 110 degree angle from your head — where straight ahead (look-
ing at the screen) is 0 degrees.
Other types of surround sound
If you’re using Dolby Digital EX or DTS ES, you have an extra speaker (or two)
to deal with. These systems have side surrounds (which are placed like 5.1-
channel side surrounds) and center surround channel speakers (one or two,
depending on whether you’re using a 6.1- or 7.1-channel setup).
These center surround speakers should be placed behind the listener. In a
6.1-channel setup, they go directly behind the listening position. In a 7.1-
channel system, the two center surround speakers should be placed along
the rear wall, on either side of the seating position.
In a 7.1 system, you should put each of the rear surrounds at an angle of 130
to 150 degrees from your main listening position — again relative to your dis-
play being 0 degrees.
Placing the subwoofer for optimal bass
You’ll often hear people talk about low-frequency sounds being nondirec-
tional, which is a fancy way of saying that you can’t really locate where they
are coming from by ear. Proponents of this concept will tell you that your
subwoofer can be hidden well out of the way — under the proverbial end
table, far away from the action. Subwoofers are nondirectional, to a degree,
250
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

but putting your subwoofer too far away from the rest of your speakers (and
from your listening position) can lead to situations in which you do hear where
the bass is coming from. Indeed, if you move your subwoofer too far to the
left or right, the bass isn’t well integrated with the sound coming from the
other speakers. In most cases, it’s actually better to not hide the subwoofer.
Treat it like any other speaker — show it off!
Many vendors recommend that you place your subwoofer in a corner. This
placement reinforces the bass significantly, and we think this is a good place
to start. However, in some rooms, you can get too much reinforcement of
your bass in the corner, and you end up with boomy bass. What we mean by
boomy is that the bass notes become indistinct; you just hear a low-frequency
sound and can’t really distinguish between the different frequencies. So if
you’re listening to a recording of someone playing a Bach fugue on a pipe
organ, you don’t hear the distinct notes in the lower register. If this happens
to you, try moving the subwoofer out from the corner a bit.
One good (if slightly unscientific) way of finding a place for your subwoofer
(after you’ve got it hooked up, of course) is to swap places with it. Put the
subwoofer right up where you sit and turn on some bass-heavy music (or a
bass-heavy movie soundtrack). Walk around the room until you find the place
where the bass sounds best. Now, swap back by putting the subwoofer in the
spot where the bass sounded best.
Figure 17-1 shows a typical 5.1-channel surround sound speaker configura-
tion. As we discuss in the previous sections, the center and front left and
right speakers are equidistant from the viewing position, with the left and
right speakers 45 to 60 degrees apart (or 22 to 30 degrees on either side of
the display from your main viewing position). The surrounds are beside or
slightly behind the comfy home theater seats, and the subwoofer is placed
along the front wall of the room.

Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

In a typical 7.1-channel configuration, the center, front, and surround speak-
ers are in the same location as they are in a 5.1 layout, but you’ve added two
additional rear surrounds located farther behind the main listening position.
Hiding Unsightly Cables
One drawback of a surround sound audio system is that having those speak-
ers alongside or behind your seating position makes hiding the speaker
cables difficult. Now, some people out there love the look of fancy speaker
wires. (Pat has a set of Kimber speaker cables that he just loves to stare at,
though his 2-year-old likes them for entirely unsafe play purposes.) But for
most people, speaker cables are an unsightly reminder of all the work they’ve
put into building their home theaters, and hiding these wires is a good thing.
The best way to hide cables, if you can pull it off, is to put them inside the
wall. If you have a basement or attic under or over, respectively, your home
theater room, using in-wall speaker cabling is pretty easy. Just make sure that
you have the proper kind of speaker cable (UL-rated CL3 or higher) and that
you use a thicker cable (lower gauge), such as 14- or even 12-gauge. See
Chapter 16 for details about cables.
Sometimes, you just can’t get your cables in the wall. For example, Pat’s
house (like many in southern California) doesn’t have a basement, and the
ceiling over his home theater is raised to the roof (no attic access). In these
cases, you can try to hide your cables under carpets or rugs. If that doesn’t
work, you might consider installing a raceway along the baseboards of your
room that can contain the wires (the raceway can, in fact, even be the base-
board itself, as long as there’s room for cables behind it), or even consider
using thin (but wide) flat cables. For example, Monster Cable (www.monster
cable.com) sells flat speaker cables in its “Invisible out of wall” series.
Taperwire (www.taperwire.com) also offers flattened versions of most
wiring you find in the house — including speaker cables — so it’s easy to
hide. These flat cables are pretty hard to see when placed along your base-
boards and can even be painted to match your wall colors.
Attaching Components 
to the A/V Receiver
Getting your speaker cables and speakers mounted in place is a good first
step. Hooking up the rest of your A/V gear is the next step. (Keep in mind that
you might have to go back to the speakers and tweak the placement of at
least some of your speakers after everything is up and running.)
252
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Spaghetti isn’t just what’s for dinner. It’s also what you get when you pull out
all the cables you bought for your home theater components. There sure is a
lot of wire behind the scenes in today’s home theater. (We hope that this will
decrease over time as digital connections, such as HDMI, become more popu-
lar.) Luckily, any home theater worth its salt has a device — the A/V receiver
or controller — that provides a central connection point for all these wires.
Also, if you have a rack for your gear, the rack should have a good cable man-
agement system to help you out. We talk about racks in Chapter 20.
At the highest level, connecting components into your home theater is as
simple as using the right cables to connect them to the back of your A/V
receiver (or controller). With very few exceptions, you don’t connect other
components directly to each other. Let your A/V receiver do its job!
Some folks believe that you get the highest-quality video signal by connecting
your components’ video cables directly to the inputs on the back of display
itself, bypassing the video source switching functionality of the receiver.
(Video switching is when you run all video into the back of the receiver and
then let the receiver send the signal you want to view to your display.) For
most folks, we think this isn’t worth the inconvenience — today’s receivers
typically have very high quality video switching circuitry, and most displays
simply don’t have enough inputs anyway. We particularly believe that you
should take advantage of your receiver’s HDMI switching and upconversion
facilities if you have these features on your receiver. (Upconversion takes
standard-definition signals and coverts them to a higher resolution for dis-
play on a high-definition TV.)
If your DVD player, set-top box, or satellite receiver (or other video source
component) offers a digital video connection like HDMI, and your display
accepts these connections, but your receiver doesn’t offer HDMI switching
(as we write in early 2006, this is still a relatively rare feature), we recom-
mend that you ignore our previous advice and make those video connections
directly, bypassing the receiver. In many cases, the quality of an HDMI signal
is worth ignoring the convenience of receiver video switching.
Hooking up your speakers
The next step is to connect your speaker wires to the appropriate speaker
outlets on your A/V receiver. This is a pretty simple process, but there are a
few things to keep in mind:
 Keep your speakers in phase. Each speaker wire consists of two con-
ductors, a positive and a negative. If you connect these out of phase
(that is, the positive on the receiver to the negative on the speaker, and
vice versa), you’ll hear a definite impact on your sound. Specifically,
your speakers can’t create the appropriate soundstage, so sounds that
253
Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

are supposed to clearly come from the right or the left won’t. (By the
way, right in this context means to the listener’s right when facing the
display or the front of the room.) Most speaker cables are also color-
coded red and black to make this job easier (or you may have a white
stripe on the jacket of one of the conductors in the speaker wire).
 Make sure you have a tight connection. For the best sound quality and
for a connection that won’t stop working over time, make sure your
speaker connections are solid. We like banana plugs or spade lugs on
five-way binding posts because you can get these suckers nice and tight.
Make a good connection the first time, and you won’t need to touch it
again for years. We discuss these different connections in more detail in
Chapter 16.
 Don’t forget to connect the subwoofer. Most subwoofers are active speak-
ers (they have their own built-in amplifiers), so you don’t use speaker
wires to connect them. You need a long analog audio interconnect cable,
which runs between the Subwoofer Out or LFE output on the back of
your receiver and the input on the subwoofer itself. Make sure you get a
cable that’s long enough to let you move the subwoofer around because
you may need to reposition your subwoofer as you discover how it inter-
acts with your home theater’s room.
Connecting to the A/V receiver
Take a look at the back of any typical A/V receiver, like the one shown in
Figure 17-2. Wow, that’s a lot of jacks, huh? Well, they’re not all back there for
show or to make the designer happy. They’re there to give you a flexible
home theater system that can do what you need it to do.

254
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Each component in your A/V system has a set of audio and/or video connec-
tions to your A/V receiver. The receiver itself connects to your speakers and
to your display (with another set of audio and video cables).
First, connect audio interconnects and video cables to each of your source
devices. Keep the following things in mind:
 Keep your right and left in mind with audio cables. Any device that
connects with analog audio cables has two connections (the cables
themselves usually, but not always, come in attached stereo pairs). One
jack (the right) is usually colored red, and the other white. Make sure
that you connect the left output on the source device to the correspond-
ing left input on the back of your receiver.
 Use digital audio connections whenever possible. Use coaxial or opti-
cal digital audio cables to connect DVD players, game consoles, DSS
receivers, or any source that has a digital audio output. If you want to
use Dolby Digital or DTS with any of these sources, you must use the dig-
ital audio connection.
Some folks feel that optical (Toslink) digital audio connections sound
better than coaxial ones. We’re not convinced of this, and recommend
that you don’t get too wrapped around the axle on this — use what you
have. If you have both types of connections available to you on the
device and the receiver and you have a preference, go with it.
Otherwise, don’t sweat this too much.
 Keep track of which connections you use on your receiver. One nice
thing about the standardized connections used in home theaters is the
fact that you don’t have to plug sources into jacks that correspond with
that device on your receiver. For example, if you have a video game con-
sole (but no corresponding “Game” inputs on your receiver), you can plug
the game console into those “Laser Disc Player” inputs — assuming, of
course, that you don’t have a laser disc player in your system. This is
where keeping track of your connections comes in handy. In order to
send the audio and video from the game console to your speakers and
display, you have to select the laser disc input on your receiver. You
might even want to make a little cheat sheet to keep near your system
(with all your little home theater quirks written down), so the rest of
your family can run the system.
Fancy A/V receivers and controllers often have assignable inputs that let
you select the names that correspond with each set of inputs on the
back of the receiver or controller. In many cases, you can even “type”
custom input names into your receiver’s display by using your remote
so that you can see the right input name on the front of your receiver or
on your on-screen display. A very handy feature to have, especially
when someone unfamiliar with the system is using it.
255
Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

 Use an extra set of audio and video cables to connect your recording
systems. Your receiver has an extra set of A/V output connectors that
correspond with its VCR inputs (usually labeled VCR1, VCR2, and so on).
When you connect your VCR or PVR (personal video recorder) to these
inputs, use an extra set of cables to connect the receiver back to the
inputs on these sources (labeled Audio In and Video In on the back of
the source). This lets you route audio and video through the receiver for
recording purposes. (You may not be able to record DVDs this way
because of DVD’s Macrovision copy protection system, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 6.)
 Use the highest-quality video connections available to you. If you can
use digital video connections (HDMI, DVI, or FireWire), do! Otherwise,
use component video if your sources have these connections. If you
must, use S-Video for sources, such as DSS receivers, that don’t have
component video connections. Some sources (such as many VCRs) have
only composite video connections.
After you’ve connected all your sources to the receiver, you can connect the
receiver to your display unit by using one or more video cables (we discuss
this shortly) and a set of analog audio interconnects.
Using this set of audio cables between the receiver and the display may seem
to be a bit of cabling overkill. After all, you already have a surround sound
audio system connected to the receiver. We find that, sometimes, we just
want to use the built-in speakers in our display, like when we flip on ESPN to
catch the college basketball scores, and then turn the TV back off. If you
don’t think you’ll ever do something like this, you can skip this step.
If you’re using an HDMI connection between your receiver and display, you
might be able to skip the step of adding an analog audio connection to the
display. HDMI cables can also carry digital audio, so there’s no need for sepa-
rate audio connections. You can only skip the analog connection, however, if
your receiver is only connected to HDMI sources or if the receiver has an
upconversion feature that takes non-HDMI sources and sends them to the dis-
play over the HDMI connection.
A step you won’t want to skip is connecting the receiver to your display with
video cables. This can be a somewhat tricky proposition — the first step you
need to take here is to understand whether your receiver has any upconver-
sion capabilities. Many receivers these days will upconvert composite and 
S-Video sources (like non-HDTV cable boxes and VCRs) so that their signals
can be sent to your display over component video cables. A growing number
of receivers will even upconvert composite, S-Video, and component video
signals to HDMI (which is a really cool feature!).
256
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

If your receiver can upconvert, you can simply connect the receiver’s video
outputs to the inputs on your display by using component video or HDMI
cables (depending, of course, on which kind of upconversion — component
or HDMI — your receiver offers).
If your receiver doesn’t handle upconversion, you need to have one set of
video cables for each kind of input you make into the receiver. So, for exam-
ple, if you have a VCR connected via composite video, a game console con-
nected via S-Video, and a DVD player connected via component video, you
need to have one of each of these types of connections running out from your
receiver to the display.
If you connect a source to your receiver with an S-Video or composite video
cable but use only a component video cable to connect the receiver to your
display, you’ll find that you get sound but no picture when you try to play
that source.
You don’t need multiples of these video connections between the receiver
and the display — just one connection for each type of connection you have
coming into your receiver. So if you have three component video sources run-
ning into the back of your receiver, you need only one set of component
video cables running to your display.
Getting television signals
TV comes into your system from a cable TV service, a DSS satellite dish, or
an antenna for broadcast TV (or in some cases, from a combination of these
devices). Regardless of the system, an RG6 coaxial cable connects these TV
sources into your system.
If you use an antenna for non-HDTV over-the-air broadcast TV (or for nondigi-
tal cable without a converter box), this connection is usually pretty simple.
Simply connect the coaxial cable coming out of your wall outlet to the Antenna/
Cable In input on the back of your display. (Note: Your cable company may
have installed a similar RG59 cable instead of an RG6 cable; if you’re running
your own cable, we recommend you use RG6.) If you’ve got a PVR or VCR,
run the cable coming out of the wall to it first, and then to the inputs on the
back of your TV.
If you have digital cable, analog cable with a converter, or a DSS dish, or if
you’re picking up over-the-air broadcast HDTV signals, you need to run the
RG6 cable to the appropriate set-top box, DSS receiver, or HDTV tuner. These
devices are connected through your A/V receiver, just like any other source
257
Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

device. You can use the receiver to send the video from these sources to your
VCR for recording (if it’s allowed).
If you’re using broadcast HDTV and you have a true HDTV (with an integrated
tuner), you can connect the coaxial cable running from this antenna directly
to the back of your display.
Similarly, if your display is digital cable–ready (or DCR) and can use a
CableCARD, you can connect the coaxial cable from your cable TV feed directly
into your TV and forgo the cable set-top box. As we discuss in Chapter 7, this
is very convenient but means that you won’t be able to access some of digital
cable’s features, like video on demand (VoD) or the on-screen program guide.
If you have digital cable, you may want to route your cable signal through the
PVR or VCR before you connect it to your set-top box. Many digital cable sys-
tems transmit a number of standard analog channels that your PVR or VCR
can tune into. Routing this cable through the PVR/VCR lets you record those
analog channels while your set-top box is tuned to a different channel (analog
or digital) for simultaneous viewing.
Adding your gaming console 
or Home Theater PC
Very few A/V receivers have made provisions for connections from game con-
soles or Home Theater PCs (HTPCs). Although these devices are too new to
have been incorporated into most receiver designs, that’s no reason to give
up hope. You can still get these devices hooked into your surround sound
system and display.
The key thing to keep in mind is that HTPCs and game consoles are really no
different from any other source device. They have analog and digital audio
connections. They have composite, S-Video, and (in many cases) component
video outputs. Your receiver doesn’t care whether these signals come from a
DVD player or an HTPC. Neither does your display.
So connect these devices just as you connect any of the other source devices
we mention earlier in this chapter. Keep the same rules in mind: Use digital
audio connections, if you can, and use the highest-quality video connection
system that the device supports.
As we hint at earlier in this chapter, you probably won’t find any inputs on
the back of your receiver marked HTPC or Xbox. So find an unused set of
inputs and use them.
258
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

If you have one of those fancy touch screen remote controls that we discuss
in Chapter 15, you may be able to program the remote to use the actual name
of the device you are using. So even if the HTPC is connected to the VCR2
input on your receiver, you can make the remote button say “HTPC.” With
this setup, the babysitter can easily use your home theater. (We’re not sure
whether or not that’s a good thing.)
Powering the Network
After you’ve made all the connections, the temptation to plug everything into
the wall and get going is strong. Hold off for one more step: making the power
connections safely. We’re not talking about your personal safety here, but the
safety of your equipment. You probably forgot about power cables, but you
should have some plans for these, too. There are lots of them, and they cer-
tainly get in the way a lot.
You’ll have to confront two big issues: the number of connections and the
quality of the connections (or, put another way, where to plug them in and
how to keep your gear from getting fried).
You will simply have way more power cables than you think. The great thing
about power management is that you can add connections as you need more
with few issues. So if you need more outlets, no problem — just add some more
outlets in the form of power strips. The overall power usage of your home the-
ater is relatively light compared with, say, a dishwasher, so in general, connect-
ing several home theater devices into one outlet is not a huge problem.
Some home theater components — high-powered receivers or power ampli-
fiers and large displays — do draw a lot of current. It’s always best to plug
these items directly into your surge protector (which we discuss next). Other
items, such as DVD players or CD players, can safely be plugged into either
the surge protector or into one of the auxiliary outlets on the back of another
piece of equipment (many receivers have such outlets).
Two kinds of outlets are used on the back of receivers: switched and
unswitched. Switched outlets turn on and off with the receiver, while
unswitched outlets are always on. Keep that distinction in mind if you have
something plugged into your receiver’s power outlets that you want to use
even when the receiver is turned off.
The bigger issue is surge protection. Electrical currents are like water cur-
rents; they flow up and down, and if they get too high (a surge), it’s a prob-
lem. (If they get too low [a brown-out], that’s a problem, too.) You need to
consider professional-class surge protection (not what you buy at Wal-Mart).
259
Chapter 17: Hooking Up Your A/V System

One good lightning strike can toast your home theater (and not in a good
way). Leviton (www.leviton.com), for example, has a Home Theater Surge
Protector that has nine outlets plus a neat expandable modular outlet that
can handle surge protection for telephones, modems, faxes, DSL modems,
cable modems, computer LANs, and satellite and cable TV systems.
If you are building from scratch or have the luxury of adding some outlets, put
in electrical lines that are dedicated to your home theater and that go straight
to your electrical panel so that no intermediate devices can cause in-home
surges on your lines.
In general, we also advocate whole-home power protectors that can help
groom the power coming from the street. That’s where some of the big surges
can come from, and these surges can hit not only your home theater, but also
everything else in your home. We consider these $300 to $800 “first line of
defense” units a must for any home. They sit between all the electrical lines
coming in and your electrical panel, truly stopping any problems before they
get to your house. You can find models that also protect your satellite and
cable connections at the home level, too. You can get these from Leviton and
other electrical suppliers.
We talk more in Chapter 21 about power conditioning, which is the next 
step up after surge protection. Power conditioners use various techniques to
restore your A/C power to a true 60 Hz, 120-volt signal and can offer better
audio and video performance.

e strongly believe that you should spend time thinking about how to
exploit your investment in your home theater by taking it whole-home.
In many instances, you’ve already done the hard part by deciding that a home
theater is worth the big investment to begin with. Now, telling you to take it to
the limit (oops, Eagles pop culture reference) by going whole-home (expand-
ing your home theater’s audio and video capabilities to other parts of your
house) should not be so rough.
The point of this chapter is to expose you to some of the varied ways you 
can accomplish whole-home networking of your audio and video gear. If you
are serious about this (and you know what’s coming here — shameless self-
promotion time!), we absolutely insist you think about getting our Smart Homes
For Dummies book (Wiley) because it goes into all the requisite details for
you to do this by yourself.
In this chapter, we talk in detail about some whole-home wiring systems that
we recommend you install when you build or remodel your house. For most
folks, the installation of whole-home wiring is not a casual project. If you don’t
have a whole-home wiring system in place and can’t put one in, don’t freak
out! We also talk about some solutions that use wireless networks or existing
wires in your wall to expand the reach of your home theater components.

262
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
Introducing Whole-Home Entertainment
Let’s talk about what it means to go whole home. If you read Chapter 2, you may
recall that you need to plan around two major concentrations of equipment:
 Wiring hub: This is generally that place where nearly everything comes
into the house from the outside. The electrical panel is likely there,
along with your incoming telephone lines, your cable or satellite service
connections, and maybe your cable or DSL modem if you were smart
and planned ahead. Ideally, most of your in-home communications and
information services are connected together in this area, with home run
wires running throughout the house in a hub-and-spoke fashion. (In a
home run wiring system, each outlet has a dedicated wire running
directly to it from the wiring hub.)
 Media hub: You can consider the main home theater to be your media
hub. Most of the gear we discuss in this book resides in the media hub,
either on shelves out in the open or in a configuration where you have
some gear in the open and some in a nearby equipment closet or rack.
When you go whole home, equipment also resides in your media hub and in
other rooms around your house. For example, Danny has a kids’ computer
lab where four computers are clustered together so that his two sets of twins
(he has always been an overachiever) cannot fight over the computers to do
their homework on-line. (Actually, Pat knows they are secretly playing
Civilization and MathBlaster.)
In most cases, you are likely to have gear spread all over the house, particu-
larly in the master bedroom, where you might have another TV, VCR, and
cable/satellite receiver (maybe even another surround sound system), and
potentially something in the kids’ rooms.
So the question — and opportunity — is how can you link all your gear to
minimize your costs (yes, you can save money by not having to buy a PVR or
a satellite receiver for each room) and exploit your investment in your media
hub? Well, have we got some ideas for you!
Think about what whole-home means for you; although you can grow your
whole-home network, you can save money in the long run if you have a better
idea of what you want to do up front. After you’ve already built the network,
adding things can be more expensive. There’s a world of difference between
running an extra set of speakers to the bedroom or dining room for your audio
and wanting to have background music in every room. If your whole-home
plans are relatively limited, you can almost always get inexpensive (under $100)
devices from Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com), X10 (www.x10.com), and
SmartHome (www.smarthome.com) that can meet these needs.

But if you want to have more flexibility to mix and match in any room, or to
have higher-quality connections, you may want to think about looking into a
whole-home distribution panel for your signals. These panels, also called struc-
tured cabling systems, can support voice, data, and video distribution in the
home relatively cheaply. You can get a good panel for under $1,000 and then
add jacks and wiring accordingly.
Not all distribution panels are alike. Some are for one specific application
(such as video), and others allow you to select whatever you want to put on
any connection. For example, a CAT-5e-based system (using that standard
computer-network cabling) might let you put phone, computer data, video,
or audio on any line. You merely change out the outlets at the terminating
end according to your needs in that room.
You can find a list of structured cabling vendors on the Web site for our book,
Smart Homes For Dummies. Check it out at www.digitaldummies.com.
At a bare minimum, a structured cabling system should provide
 A flexible telephone network using high-quality, unshielded twisted-
pair (UTP) phone cabling and a modular, configurable termination
system in the wiring closet (the central location where all of these sys-
tems are connected together)
 A computer network of CAT-5e (the standard for Ethernet computer net-
work cabling) UTP cabling for data networking
 A centrally distributed coaxial cable (usually RG6 — the standard
video cabling) network for distributing video signals
 An all-in-one modular termination panel to neatly terminate all this
network wiring in your wiring closet
 Customized wall outlet plates to provide connectors for your phone,
data, audio, and video outlets that can be easily changed and reconfigured
Connecting to a Whole-Home 
Audio System
Whole-home audio is a pretty simple baseline that a lot of people consider
when moving out of the home theater and into the other parts of the house.
After all, the first step can be as easy as merely stringing another set of speaker
wires from your multizone-capable A/V receiver (we talk about these in
Chapter 11) in your home theater to, say, remote speakers located in the
dining room. Keep in mind, however, that the limitations of a whole-home
263
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

audio network are based on your A/V receiver. Most A/V receivers that have
multizone capabilities can support audio in only one or two other rooms —
not zones in every room in the house.
So if you want a true whole-home audio system, you probably need to con-
sider installing additional equipment in the media hub (or nearby). With this
equipment in place (and the appropriate wires in the wall), you can share the
audio source devices in your home theater with any room in the house. In
almost all cases, this system provides stereo (two-channel) audio, not sur-
round sound (multichannel) audio, in rooms outside your home theater. The
sidebar, “The trouble with whole-home surround sound,” talks about this
issue a bit more.
You can get audio from your home theater to other rooms in the house in
four primary ways:
 Use your receiver: As we mention earlier, many receivers (at least above
the $500–$600 price range) include multizone functionality that lets you
run speaker wires or a long audio interconnect. You can really run these
only into an adjacent room, not the entire length of the house, due to
signal loss. This is the simplest way to get audio elsewhere in the home.
 Buy a whole-home audio distribution system: These systems come in
both multizone and single-zone versions (we explain the difference later
in this chapter) and use their own amplifiers and control systems to
send audio to any room in the house. You can buy whole-home audio
systems that support up to eight or more rooms.
 Use a CAT-5e audio distribution system: These systems can distribute
line-level stereo audio signals over standard CAT-5e computer network
cabling. Many of these systems are designed to carry both audio and
video. Some (such as the SVC-10 from ChannelPlus, www.channelplus.
com) can even carry the higher-quality S-Video signals and digital audio
signals (such as Dolby Digital) over this network cabling. Most of these
systems, however, can carry only composite video and stereo audio.
 Use a wireless audio distribution system: These are typically simple
systems designed to go from point to point (rather than cover the whole
home). Many people use them to send audio from their PC to their home
theater, but they can also be used to get audio from a source in the
home theater to other parts of the house.
Most of the CAT-5e and many of the wireless audio distribution systems we
are about to discuss can also carry video signals.
Some of the whole-home audio network systems that we talk about use CAT-5e
cabling, and we expect (in the not so distant future) to see systems that can
distribute surround sound audio around the house digitally using this cable.
Until these systems become available, however, we think it’s best to stick with
good old-fashioned two-channel stereo for whole-home audio networks.
264
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Zoning out: Single-zone versus 
multizone systems
After you start sending audio to a whole-home audio network, you have some
decisions to make. The biggest decision is what you want to listen to in differ-
ent parts of your house. No, we’re not talking about what CDs you’re going to
play, but rather what kind of flexibility your system has to play different audio
sources in different parts of the house simultaneously.
In a single-zone audio system, you have only one audio source distributed to
every endpoint across the network at any given time. You can turn various
sets of speakers on or off, but you don’t have the ability to listen to different
audio sources in different parts of your house at the same time. A multizone
audio system, such as the one shown in Figure 18-1, on the other hand, allows
one family member to listen to, say, a CD in the family room while another
person listens to the audio channel of a DVD in his or her bedroom. Some
multizone systems will let you get really fancy and will let you share source
devices in multiple locations throughout the home, while others will distrib-
ute audio sources from one location to multiple places within the home — in
other words, some will play equipment from your home theater anywhere,
while others will play equipment from all over the home in any room you
choose.
Single-zone systems are easier and cheaper to build, but obviously less flexi-
ble than multizone systems. The good news is that the basic architecture (the
wires you put in your walls) is usually the same for both types of systems. So
you can install an inexpensive single-zone system and then upgrade your
equipment to multizone later on.
265
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network
The trouble with whole-home surround sound
The stereo audio standard, in which sound is
separated into two channels (left and right), still
dominates music production. With the advent 
of home theater, however, music can now be
produced using multiple channels to drive a
multitude of speakers.
For the average home (read that as a non-mil-
lionaire home), we recommend that you don’t
add multichannel capabilities to your whole-
home audio network — at least not right now.
Although you can build an audio network that
goes beyond the two-channel (stereo) limit
today, the network quickly becomes extremely
complicated and prohibitively expensive. We
think the best way to create a second multi-
channel surround system is to simply install a
second, standalone surround sound system in
that other room. If you’re just trying to get sur-
round sound in a bedroom or kid’s room, you
might consider an inexpensive home-theater-in-
a-box solution that will give you surround sound
for only a few hundred dollars.

Using speaker wires to build 
an audio network
The traditional way to expand an audio network is to simply extend in-the-
wall speaker wires from your home theater or media center to remote loca-
tions in your house (anywhere you want to have audio). Remember that you
need to use UL-rated CL3 speaker wires — given the distances traversed by
these wires, we recommend 14-gauge or smaller wires. Refer to Figure 18-1 for
a look at a simple multizone audio system. Chapter 16 explains cables and
wires in more detail.
If your A/V receiver has multiroom capability, you can connect these speaker
wires directly to your receiver by using a device called an impedance match-
ing system (which we describe in more detail in the sidebar, “A word about
impedance matching systems”). This device is necessary when you are con-
necting more than one pair of speakers to a single pair of speaker terminals
on a receiver or amplifier — if you’re just hooking up one set of speakers to
that multiroom output, you can skip the impedance matching system.
A better way to use those speaker wire connections to multiple remote rooms
is to use a special-purpose, multiroom, integrated amplifier. These devices
contain individual pairs of amplifiers for each remote pair of speakers, so you
don’t need an impedance matching system, and you get plenty of power (and
volume) in remote rooms. You can get multiroom integrated amplifiers in
both single-zone and multizone configurations. These integrated amplifiers
are available from companies such as Niles Audio (www.nilesaudio.com).

Part IV: Putting It All Together 

If you want to create a relatively inexpensive two-zone audio system, look for
a multizone A/V receiver that has line-level outputs, instead of speaker-level
outputs, for the second zone. With these systems, you can simply plug the
receiver into a single-zone, multiroom, integrated amplifier using a pair of
standard audio interconnect cables. Your home theater is Zone 1, and the
rest of your house is Zone 2. It’s not as good as a true multizone system, but a
lot cheaper and easier to set up.
Besides a centralized amplifier/control system and speaker wires in the wall,
you, of course, need to install speakers in the remote rooms. Most folks decide
to use in-wall speaker systems (often placing these speakers in the ceiling), but
you can also install speaker terminal wall jacks and then use standard loud-
speakers. You connect the loudspeakers to these wall jacks just as you might
connect them to the back of a receiver.
Controlling whole-home audio with IR
The other big challenge for a whole-home audio system is controlling your
A/V components from remote rooms. Remember that most A/V components
use IR (infrared) remote control systems, and that IR doesn’t travel through
walls and other obstacles. So you’ll need a remote control system that can
carry IR signals from IR sensors (that you simply aim a remote control at) or
wall-mounted volume controls and keypads in your remote rooms. These
whole-home IR systems typically require special three-conductor IR cabling,
267
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network
How do I connect source devices 
to my multiroom system?
Most audio source devices (such as CD players)
have only one set of audio outputs on the 
back, and you probably already have this set
connected to your A/V receiver. So how can 
you also feed this audio into a separate multi-
room amplifier system? There are two options
(besides buying a second CD player).
The easiest (and cheapest) way to do this is to
use a Y-splitter audio cable that splits a single
pair of stereo audio signals into two pairs. One
branch of the Y goes to your A/V receiver, 
and the other to your multiroom system. You can
buy these cables at Radio Shack and similar
retailers.
Some multiroom installations use separate
amplifiers for each zone. In these systems, you
need more than a simple two-for-one split from
a Y-splitter. The solution here is to use a signal
distribution amplifier. This device takes the
output of a source device, splits it into multiple
outputs, and then amplifies these outputs to
ensure that your signal is not degraded (if you
split the signal without amplifying it, it could be
too weak and would cause distortion that you
would hear as a background noise or hiss). This
is the best approach if you are using separate
amplifiers for each remote pair of speakers.

but can also be carried over other cables, such as CAT-5e computer network
cables or even over the RG6 coaxial cables that carry video signals around
the house from an antenna or cable TV service.
You need a few components to connect a whole-home IR system together:
 IR sensors or keypads in remote rooms: These are the end of the line
for your IR network. Each run of IR cable terminates in one of these
devices. IR sensors and keypads send IR control signals over the IR
cabling as electrical signals.
 An IR connecting block in your media hub: This device connects to the
other end of the IR cable runs and concentrates the IR signals they carry
into outputs that can control your A/V components. You need a connect-
ing block because you want only one IR input connected to each compo-
nent in your system, but you have IR sensors or keypads in multiple
rooms. The connecting block allows, for example, the IR signals coming
from five different rooms to be sent to a single CD player.
 IR emitters (IR blasters): These devices run from the connecting block
to the components themselves. IR emitters have only one function in
life: They convert the electrical control signals back into IR (light) sig-
nals that A/V components can understand.
Building a whole-home IR distribution system is a relatively complicated
process. The hardest part is programming keypads and getting the right IR sig-
nals to the right A/V components. We highly recommend that you work with a
professional installer if you want to implement a whole-home IR network.
CAT-5e or wireless audio distribution systems can often carry IR control sig-
nals for you, so you won’t need a separate IR network.
Plugging into CAT-5e
Aside from speaker cabling, you have other whole-home audio cabling
options, such as CAT-5e. Systems from a variety of manufacturers can suc-
cessfully carry line-level audio signals (the signals carried over audio inter-
connects) over CAT-5e cables in your walls. On the inexpensive end, you can
get systems that convert the left and right line-level outputs of an audio
device into a balanced signal. If high-end is your thing, go all the way with
full-fledged, expensive audio (and video!) distribution systems that provide
true multizone audio over CAT-5e.
You can distribute audio signals around the home using CAT-5e in three
major ways, which we discuss in the following sections.
268
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Point to point with baluns
Baluns are deployed in pairs for point-to-point use — meaning that it sends 
a signal from one place to a single other location (as opposed to a point-to-
multipoint system, which can send a signal to multiple different locations). 
A balun is just a little passive device (meaning it doesn’t need any external
power), about the size of a deck of cards, with receptacles on both sides (an
RJ-45 on one side and two or more RCA jacks on the other). One balun is asso-
ciated with the source device (such as a CD player or the Audio Out ports of a
receiver). This balun connects through an RCA audio interconnect to the left
and right Audio Out channels. Then, you plug the balun into the CAT-5e cable
by using a CAT-5e patch cable. At the other end of the network — down another
leg of your home’s CAT-5e that you’ve dedicated to audio — the process is
reversed. The second balun plugs into the RJ-45 outlet on your wall (again
using a patch cable), and then plugs into the left and right Audio In jacks of
the remote amplifier or receiver that you’re feeding the signal to. An example
of one of these products is MuxLab’s Stereo Hi-Fi Balun (www.muxlab.com).
You can also find baluns that can distribute digital audio signals — like the
bitstream outputs of DVD players and other Dolby Digital or DTS sources —
over CAT-5e cables. In many cases, these baluns can carry high-quality com-
ponent video signals as well. An example of such a product is Intelix’s (www.
intelix.com) V3AD HDTV Component Video and Digital Audio over CAT-5
Balun. These units can connect to any source device with component video
and coaxial digital audio outputs and send the signal over up to 1,000 feet of
CAT-5e cabling.
Most folks find that these sort of baluns are most useful not for sending sig-
nals to a second room, but rather for use within a larger home theater room.
For example, if you are trying to hide your source components within a closet
or equipment room on one side of a large home theater room and are installing
a display and speakers rather far away, you can use inexpensive CAT-5e cabling
and baluns rather than running more expensive audio and video cables.
Single-zone CAT-5e audio-distribution systems
In the world of audio and CAT-5e, the next step up moves beyond the point-to-
point limitation of baluns and provides a single-zone audio distribution net-
work to multiple locations throughout the home. These systems, from vendors
such as Russound (www.russound.com) and Leviton (www.leviton.com),
typically use custom faceplates (the plastic plates that cover standard wall
outlets) that replace standard RJ-45 faceplates in each room. These faceplates
have a pair of female RCA audio jacks that can connect to any standard audio
source device or amplifier/receiver. In the room containing the source device
you want to share throughout the home, you simply plug a stereo audio patch
cable between the device and the faceplate.
269
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

In remote rooms, you use an audio patch cable to connect the faceplate to the
inputs of a local receiver or amplifier. Connecting these remote outlets is a spe-
cial CAT-5e audio hub located in your wiring closet. This hub takes the source
signal and distributes it to every other CAT-5e outlet connected to the hub.
Multizone CAT-5e audio-distribution systems
If you want the utmost in flexibility and capability in a CAT-5e-based audio-
distribution system, you need a system that can carry different audio programs
to different parts of the house simultaneously — a multizone, multisource
system. Like the multizone speaker-level systems discussed earlier in the
chapter, multizone CAT-5e systems are high-end solutions that don’t come
cheap, but they can offer the utmost in sound quality and convenience.
Because sending audio over CAT-5e is still new, it’s not cheap. You’ll probably
end up paying $1,000 or more for the components alone, and that doesn’t
include the speakers and amplifiers or receivers in each room. And that’s for
the (relatively) cheap versions of these systems. Some high-end systems can
cost tens of thousands of dollars. You can get systems from players such as
Crestron (www.crestron.com), Russound (www.russound.com), and Niles
Audio (www.nilesaudio.com).
270
Part IV: Putting It All Together 
A word about impedance matching systems
When we talk about A/V receivers, and partic-
ularly about their amplifier sections, in Chapter
11, we mention that many receivers have trou-
ble dealing with speakers with an impedance 
(a measure of electrical resistance) of 4 ohms
or less. This really comes into play in whole-
home audio systems. That’s because when you
try to drive two sets of speakers from the same
stereo amplifier, the impedance of the speakers
is effectively halved. That is to say, if you plug
two sets of 8-ohm speakers into a single stereo
amplifier, you end up with an effective imped-
ance of 4 ohms. Add a third set, and you’re in
the danger zone for most receivers.
If you have a multizone audio distribution
system, impedance isn’t an issue (each pair of
speakers has its own amplifier), but in a single-
zone system, many folks try to cram multiple
pairs of speakers onto a single amplifier. The
safe way to do this is to use an impedance
matching system. These systems let you hook
up two, three, four, or more pairs of speakers to
a single stereo amplifier without the impedance
dropping to an unsafe level. Keep in mind that
the amplifier power provided to these remote
speakers will be reduced as you add extra sets
of speakers onto the system. So the impedance
matching system will protect your amplifier, but
you may not get enough power to reach the
volume levels you want.

Going wireless
The most popular way of getting audio around the house without a dedicated
network is with an RF (radio frequency) wireless system. These come in two
main flavors:
 Wireless speaker systems connect to the line-level outputs of a source
device or preamplifier and send the signal over a 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz
channel to a pair of self-amplified stereo speakers.
 Wireless line-level distribution systems hook up to your source compo-
nents in the same fashion but send their signals to a receiver that hooks
into your own amplifier and speakers on the far end.
One major potential difficulty with many wireless systems is that they use a
line-level input — something that most source devices have only one of. So
you may run into trouble hooking up a CD player, for example, to both your
A/V receiver (or controller) for local listening and to one of these devices for
remote listening. Luckily, many of these units also accept the output of your
receiver or amp’s headphone jack, so you can avoid this problem if you have
a headphone jack available. Alternatively, you can use one of the Y-splitter
audio cables we mention in the sidebar, “How do I connect source devices to
my multiroom system?” earlier in this chapter. Prices for these wireless sys-
tems range from about $75 to $200. Major manufacturers include
 Recoton (www.recoton.com)
 RCA (www.rca.com)
 Logitech (www.logitech.com)
Another cool wireless product comes from the X10 Wireless Technologies folks
(www.x10.com). (You probably know them from their infamous Internet pop-up
ads on many popular Web sites.) X10’s MP3 Anywhere system ($79.99) works
like the other systems we describe, but it’s available with a feature that we think
is pretty cool: X10’s BOOM! software. This software runs on your Windows PC
and lets you remotely control and access the PC’s MP3 music files as well as
CDs and DVDs played back in the PC’s internal drive. RCA (www.rca.com) has a
$99 Lyra Wireless RD900W that lets you play PC-based music through the
stereo, too.
The current state-of-the-art in wireless audio distribution systems involve
those systems that use 802.11 (Wi-Fi) wireless networking to distribute audio
around the home. Our current favorite system is the Sonos Digital Music
System (www.sonos.com). The baseline Sonos system (the “introductory
bundle”) starts at $1,195 and supports two rooms.
271
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

This technogeek’s dream system consists of a controller (the brains of the
system), a “zone” player (the endpoints of the system where all the speaker
and system interfaces are housed, as well as a four-port switch so that you
can network other items in the vicinity — nice!), and matching speakers you
can use if you want everything to match.
Most buyers of the Sonos system also buy a local NAS (Network Attached
Storage) hard drive because the Sonos itself doesn’t have one — a non-NAS
system just plays music found elsewhere, like on your PC. You can also have
more than one Sonos zone player; the players talk to each other and the con-
troller in a “mesh” fashion (meaning the signal can hop from station to station,
rather than only radiating out from the main base station), so if you have a
really long house, you can still use the Sonos system. In such instances, the
Sonos system synchronizes the music so that it all plays at the same time,
avoiding any weird echo-type sounds around the house. Sonos uses 802.11g
for its wireless protocol — but doesn’t connect to your Wi-Fi access points (it
creates its own “mesh” network) — hopping from Sonos to Sonos throughout
your home.
Sharing Video Components 
throughout the Home
Sharing video in the home used to be a lot simpler a few years ago than it is
today. This is largely due to the advent of all sorts of signal encryption as
well as the introduction of digital transmissions into the mix. These have
added their unique flies in the whole-home networking ointment.
You can share home theater video signals within your home (speaking gener-
ally here, of course) in four major ways:
 Use modulators to send your video over the coaxial cable carrying your
antenna or cable TV signal
 Use a CAT-5e audio/video distribution system
 Use a wireless audio/video distribution system
 Use a system that carries audio and video over your existing phone wires
As the price of video source devices (like DVD players) plummets, the eco-
nomics of creating a video distribution network in your home turns on its
head. A few years ago, when DVD players cost $500 apiece, it made sense to
create a system that could share the DVD player in your home theater with
TVs in other rooms. Now that you can buy a good quality upconverting DVD
player for well under $100, most folks simply choose to have an extra set 
of video source devices in remote locations. You may, however, run into a 
situation in which you’d like to share some sources in your home theater
272
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

with displays in other parts of the home — in the following section, we tell
you how to do so.
Using your TV cables
Most structured cabling systems (complete prepackaged home wiring prod-
ucts) include a centralized video distribution system. This system differs from
the standard cable company installations in one big way. Most cable installa-
tions use a branch and tree architecture, with the cable coming into your house
from the street and then being fed into a series of splitters — little “one in, two
out” devices that split a cable signal into two branches. A centralized video dis-
tribution system uses a special splitter, called a video distribution panel, that
splits the incoming cable (or antenna) signal into multiple lines running to all
of your TVs — each a home run cable in a hub-and-spoke architecture.
With a central video distribution panel, you can create your own in-house
television channels using modulators over your in-home coax cables. Simply
put, a modulator takes the composite or S-Video output of a video source
device (as well as the stereo analog audio outputs) and transforms it into an
RF (radio frequency) signal — just like a television station does. You simply
set the modulator to broadcast over an unused channel and connect it to your
video distribution panel. When you want to watch that source somewhere else
in the house, you just need to tune your remote TV to that station, and voilà!
Figure 18-2 shows a modulated signal (in this case, a VCR, but it can be any
video source, such as a DVD player or a DSS satellite receiver).

Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

Modulator systems don’t work for everybody. New digital cable systems are
designed to use all or most of the available spectrum on your home’s coax
network, so carving out bandwidth for your piggyback data transmission is
not so easy. In many instances, it’s almost impossible. You are likely better off
pursuing some of the nonmodulator alternatives we’re about to discuss
instead.
CAT-5e and wireless systems
Many of the CAT-5e and wireless systems we discuss earlier in the chapter
can carry video signals in addition to audio signals. In the case of CAT-5e sys-
tems, we think that you can actually get a higher-quality video signal around
the house than you can with a modulator system. That’s because the process
of modulating and then demodulating a video source (when it gets back into
your remote TV) tends to diminish your picture quality. Some of these CAT-5e
systems can even carry component signals and digital audio for high-quality
video (even HDTV!) and surround sound audio in remote locations. (You need
an A/V receiver and surround speakers in these remote locations to take
advantage of this.)
A simpler way of getting video around the house is to use a phone line system.
The Leapfrog HomeNetwork by Terk (a division of Audiovox, www.audiovox.
com) is a device — or rather a pair of devices — that transmits video and/or
audio signals from a source device (such as a satellite receiver or PVR) to a
remote location over existing phone lines. The pair’s transmitter half con-
nects to the source unit’s RF or line-level video and audio outputs and plugs
into a standard phone jack. At the remote end, the receiver also plugs into a
phone jack and connects to the RF or line-level audio and video inputs of the
remote television or audio system. The Leapfrog also carries infrared control
signals over your phone lines, so you can carry your remote with you to the
room containing the receiver and do all the pausing, fast-forwarding, and
channel-changing you like without running back and forth.
Interfacing with Your Telephone System
The days are gone when the telephone was simply something you had a con-
versation over. Indeed, your telephone system now can also be a data access
point for dialup Internet access, an inbound interface to your system from
afar, and even an in-home interface to your home automation system. (And
you thought it was just a phone.)
274
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

At the simplest level, devices need to meet baseline requirements in order to
interconnect with your telephone system. Your DSS receiver, for instance,
requires a phone line interface so that the receiver can access your account
database in order to track on-line movie purchases. And some of the gaming
consoles enable you to compete in multiplayer networks via dialup connec-
tions (although after you try broadband, you’ll never go back to dialup).
Nothing about interconnecting your home theater to your home telephone
system is overtly complex. At the basic level, you simply plug any device that
requires a phone connection into the nearest outlet. If you have multiple
devices, they can share a single wall outlet if you use an inexpensive 2-in-1
jack adapter ($5 from Radio Shack).
If you don’t have a phone outlet nearby, you can get a wireless phone jack
(like RCA’s RC926) for around $80 that uses the electrical lines in your house
to transmit your telephone communications. You plug a standard telephone
line into an adapter that plugs into the electrical outlet at your home theater.
Then, in a room where there is an available phone outlet, you do the same,
only this time you run a phone cable from the electrical outlet into the phone
outlet. Shazaam! — one phone line.
Do not use a wireless phone jack with a surge protector because this may
block the frequencies over which your phone line communicates; plug the
unit directly into the wall.
A nice little device is the TV Messenger (www.smarthome.com, $79.99),
which shows you on your TV screen who is calling during your favorite TV
show so you know whether you want to get up to answer the phone. When
the phone rings, the TV Messenger automatically pops up the Caller ID info
on the top of the TV screen without interrupting the program. If you sub-
scribe to phone-company voice mail, the LED blinks when messages are wait-
ing, too. You want to use this only for your analog TV signals because you
don’t want to limit your higher-quality DVD and other video to composite
connections (all that the device offers). The TV Messenger sits in-line to your
video signal between the TV source and the receiver, connected via a simple
composite video interconnect cable.
Connecting to Your Computer LAN
We talk in Chapter 2 about having a wiring closet for your Ethernet hubs and
routers, in Chapter 6 about Ethernet ports on your DVRs, in Chapter 9 about
gaming consoles with network interfaces, and so on. Computer networks are
becoming an important part of your home theater infrastructure.
275
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

Accessing a whole-home computer network (also know as a local area 
network — LAN for short) opens up your home theater to any data point 
on your network. A good example is Danny’s AudioReQuest CD server. It has
an onboard Web server that allows access to this music from wherever he
wants, in the house or over the Internet. He can synchronize his boxes in
Maine and Connecticut because they are connected to the Internet. As soon
as he finishes this book, he’s going to extend that to synching with his car
stereos, too — over wireless computer network connections. The same is
true with his SnapStream PVR. He can record programs while he is away and
download them from anywhere on the planet. Now he can catch up on The
Sopranos from Kiev!
While we’ve not heard of anyone having this problem, it is possible that your
ISP (Internet service provider) may forbid this kind of “server” connection.
Most ISPs have absolutely frightening “terms of service” agreements that
forbid just about everything but checking your e-mail and surfing the Web on
your connection. Most of these agreements are not strictly observed, but if
you start really using a lot of bandwidth, your ISP may either make you stop
or make you pay for a more expensive connection.
Getting your home theater devices to communicate with your computer net-
work is getting easier all the time thanks to newer technologies, lower costs,
and equipment vendors’ increased experience with the consumer market. It’s
getting to be almost automatic!
We talk about Ethernet networks because, frankly, you’re unlikely to want
another protocol on your computer network. You could use other LAN systems
(like ATM), but Ethernet really rules the computing domain.
Accordingly, it’s likely — very likely — that you’ll connect your home theater
with your computer LAN over Ethernet connections.
So, assuming this is the case, the question then becomes, “How do you inter-
connect with that LAN?” Well, it depends on the extent of your LAN, if it exists
at all. Although we don’t have space in this book to discuss all the ins and
outs of computer networking, we want to offer a little guidance to help you on
your way toward a whole-home computing backbone that can make use of
your home theater system. Here are a few networking points to keep in mind:
 You can carry data signals around your house in at least four major
ways: CAT-5e cabling, wireless, electrical cables, and regular phone
wiring and coaxial cables. We recommend, if you can do it, that you run
new CAT-5e cables through your walls to the places where you want it. If
you use CAT-5e for your audio or video distribution, then you are likely
building a new home or renovating your current one, and running the
cable shouldn’t be a problem. A wired infrastructure gives you much
higher data rates, more reliability, and more flexibility for the future —
and it can add to the value of your home.
276
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

 Wireless options are great. These are quickly coming down in price,
and you can build a home data network just by adding a wireless access
point to your network. (A wireless access point is a base station of a
wireless network — think of it as the equivalent of a cordless phone
base station.) You then bring your devices on-line by adding PC cards
(which plug into standardized PC card slots on the device) or USB-based
dongles (or adapters) that plug into the USB ports. Most devices follow
the 54 Mbps 802.11g wireless standard, and a few use the 802.11a stan-
dard, which provides the same speed using different frequencies (which
are less crowded with cordless phones and the like). Some time in the
next year, you’ll start seeing new wireless gear based on the forthcoming
802.11n standard, which will provide speeds in excess of 100 Mbps. (The
final standard is still up in the air as we write, and may offer speeds
nearly double that.)
 You can transmit signals over electrical cables, too. The trick here is 
to use low-cost devices that conform to the HomePlug standard — a
standard networking protocol for Ethernet connections using AC power-
lines. This standard allows up to 14 Mbps transmission rates (85 Mbps
with the newest “Turbo” units), but speeds vary substantially based on
where you plug in the devices and what is turned on at any particular
time. NETGEAR (www.netgear.com) is one big vendor of HomePlug
gear, with the Model XE102 wall-plugged Ethernet bridge that enables
you to build a complete home network by doing nothing more than plug-
ging devices into the electrical outlets. Pretty cool. In fact, a whole-home
computer network for less than $50 a room is very cool. Want to add a
room? Plug in an electrical module. Done.
The folks who create the underlying HomePlug technology have a new
variant in the wings — HomePlug AV — which will provide speeds up to
200 Mbps. Check out www.homeplug.org for more information about
this new standard and for product availability.
 You can also use the coaxial cables and phone lines in your house to
send signals from room to room. A few networking systems use unused
higher frequencies on the cable to send the data, so you can still talk on
the phone or watch video at the same time. This is based on the Home
Phoneline Networking Alliance (HPNA) standards. In general, the other
options we mention are preferable to HPNA at this time, but new, faster
versions of HPNA have been promised. Check out www.homepna.com
for information about product availability.
Some new systems use coaxial (cable TV) cables to send data around the
house. MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance, www.mocalliance.com),
for example, can provide speeds of up to 200 Mbps over these cables.
Another similar technology, TVnet by Coaxsys (www.coaxsys.com),
provides speeds of up to 70 Mbps. MoCA and TVnet are not products
you can just go out and buy at the store, however. Instead, they are
going to be built into devices, like cable set-top boxes, to allow cable
companies to send TV signals between boxes in the home.
277
Chapter 18: Plugging into a Whole-Home Entertainment Network

 If you have a high-speed cable, DSL, or satellite Internet connection,
you have your high-speed Internet modem located somewhere on
your network. It does not matter where you put the modem, from the
home theater perspective, because there really is no specific reason the
broadband Internet connection has to be located within your theater
room. In fact, most people like to put their modem either close to their
computing area or in the wiring closet, out of sight.
 You need a router if you want to support multiple Ethernet devices on
one network and have them interface with the Internet. Often, the DSL/
cable/satellite modem is also a router, but not always. The router has a
built-in hub that enables you to interconnect multiple data lines.
 If you are going to be routing video or large files over your LAN, con-
sider getting an Ethernet switch instead of a hub so that you can make
sure you get all the bandwidth you need for a quality transmission. (Most
routers include an Ethernet switch, but you may need an external switch
with more ports if you have lots of devices on your network.)
Although many vendors will try to push you into one solution (“You need 
Wi-Fi.” “No, you need HomePlug.”), you might find that these various networks
can complement each other. You know that we think a wired CAT-5e network
should be the basis of your computer-LAN infrastructure (and phone network,
and maybe even your audio and video network). But we also think that all the
data networking technologies can be used in concert when you build a whole-
home network.
Just for fun, here are a few examples:
 Build a wired Ethernet LAN but add a Wi-Fi access point in your living
room for cordless, sofa-based Web surfing.
 Use Wi-Fi as the basis for your home-computer LAN, but use HomePlug
or HPNA to extend your network to access points in distant locations
out of reach of your primary base station (such as by the pool).
 Use wired Ethernet for your computers, but use a HomePlug system to
connect your Xbox to the broadband Internet connection for on-line
gaming.
We could keep this list going and going, but we think you get the picture. Think
creatively and use wired and unwired technologies together to get your LAN
wherever you need it to go.

Letting Your Home
Theater Be All 
It Can Be

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we get a bit fancy. It’s all about what to do
after everything is put together. First, we discuss how
to use the controls on your video systems (your television
and your video source devices) to get the best picture
possible.
We also discuss how to tweak your audio system so that
you can adjust it to the dynamics of your home theater.
Our friends in the installation business are constantly
amazed at how bad good audio gear can sound if it’s not
set up properly. Conversely, even modestly priced gear
can sound great if it’s properly tweaked.
We also talk about ways you can improve your home the-
ater’s environment. If you think about it, home theater is
really all about creating light and sound that you can
interact with. If you keep environmental lights and sounds
from interfering with your theater, you can get more
enjoyment out of your gear.
Finally, we talk about the high end of home theater and
how to go all out in pursuit of a home theater experience.
Even if you have budget limitations, you can get a preview
of the future of home theater.

etting your A/V system hooked up can be a bit of a challenge, but it’s
rewarding to have all that “on your hands and knees” plug-fest work
behind you. You have to take one more step, however, before you sit back
and really enjoy your home theater. You need to spend some time tweaking
your system — adjusting the video display and getting your surround sound
set up properly.
In this chapter, we discuss ways to calibrate your system. This may seem like
overkill to some folks, but it is critical. Joel Silver, the president of the Imaging
Science Foundation — these folks know a thing or two about setting up home
theaters! — tells us that over 90 percent of home theater displays are set up
incorrectly. With a few tools, you can be part of the small percentage of home
theater owners who are getting the most out of what they’ve paid for.
Calibrating Your Video
We’ve said it before — and we’ll say it again, because it’s important — most
displays come from the factory improperly calibrated. The brightness and
color are set at unnatural levels in order to make the displays stand out on
the showroom floor (in a brightly lit store). At these settings, if you put them
in a darkened home theater, the picture looks awful.

If you have a direct-view or projection CRT (cathode ray tube) or a plasma
display, you have an additional reason to calibrate your video: The overly
bright settings that most of these units come with can reduce the lifespan of
your display! Even if your display is not brand new or not all that fancy, a cali-
bration can breathe new life into your picture quality.
On your average display, you (as a nontechnician) can make five adjustments.
A few sets let you adjust more, and service techs with the proper manuals and
codes to get into the service menus of the display can adjust just about any-
thing. But an average person (like you or us) can adjust the following controls:
 Contrast (white level): Don’t confuse this with contrast ratio, which we
discuss earlier in the book. (It’s the ratio between the brightest and
darkest images a display can create, if you didn’t get to that part of the
book yet.) In terms of display adjustments, your contrast control adjusts
the white level, or degree of whiteness your screen displays. You see, in
video displays, whites and blacks are measured on a scale called IRE
(Institute of Radio Engineers) units, which are represented as a percent-
age: 0 percent is black; 100 percent is white. You can actually drive your
TV beyond 100 percent if your contrast is improperly set. If you do this,
white portions of your picture tend to bleed over into the darker por-
tions surrounding them.
 Brightness (black level): Now to throw in a counterintuitive statement:
The brightness control on your display actually adjusts the black level
that you see on the screen. Weird, huh? If the black level is set incor-
rectly, you can’t discern the difference between darker images on your
screen.
 Sharpness: The sharpness control adjusts the fine detail of the picture —
its ability to display minute details on the screen. If the sharpness is set
too low, you have a fuzzy picture; if it’s set too high, your picture appears
edgy, often with blobs around the edges of objects instead of clearly
defined lines.
 Color: Along with tint (which we discuss next), color is one of the two
controls that let you set the balance of the colors (finally, a name that
says what it means!) on your display. If your color setting is too low,
images begin to appear as black and white. If it’s too high, images take
on a reddish tinge (for example, Nicole Kidman’s face will turn as red as
her hair).
 Tint (hue): On most TVs, this control is labeled tint, but a few are more
technically correct and call it hue. The tint control adjusts your display’s
color within a range between red and green — your job will be to find
the perfect balance between them.

Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

Almost every display we know of has an on-screen display that shows the
status of these settings. Typically, you’ll find a horizontal bar running across
your screen, with either a moving vertical hash mark that shows your current
setting, or the entire bar moves left or right as you increase or decrease these
settings. Some displays also have a numeric display (usually running from 0
to 100) that shows your current setting.
We like the numeric displays because writing down a number is much easier (if
you want to re-create a setting in the future) than trying to remember exactly
how far across the screen a particular bar was.
Using a calibration disc
The best way to adjust your video is to use a DVD home theater calibration
disc. We consider these discs (which cost about $50) to be an absolutely
essential investment in your home theater. Unless you’ve had a professional
calibrate your system (or you’ve spent so much on everything else that you
can’t afford the disc), we think you simply must get one of these discs. (And
no, no one is paying us to say that.)
The most common home theater calibration discs are the following:
 Avia: Guide to Home Theater: Available from Ovation Multimedia
(www.ovationmultimedia.com), this disc contains a ton of great
background material about home theater. It explains a lot of the same
stuff we talk about here in Home Theater For Dummies. It also contains a
series of easy-to-follow on-screen test patterns and signals that let you
correctly adjust all the settings we discuss in the preceding section. It
also gives you test tones to help calibrate your surround sound audio
systems (which we discuss in a moment). This disc runs $49.95 directly
from Ovation.
We suspect most folks will find it to be overkill, but Ovation also pro-
duces a professional-quality variant of its test disc, the Avia PRO. This
$400 set consists of seven DVDs and an elaborate user manual for the
ultimate in calibration.
 Digital Video Essentials: Found on-line at www.videoessentials.com,
this is the definitive calibration disc. One really cool thing about Video
Essentials is the inclusion of video footage that you can watch to see the
results of your adjustments with actual video, instead of just on a test pat-
tern. Digital Video Essentials lists for $24.95 and is widely available on-line.
283
Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System

The folks at Joe Kane Productions (who created Digital Video Essentials)
also have a six-disc professional set called Digital Video Essentials
Professional, which retails for $350 and includes some high-definition cal-
ibrations (using the Windows Media system for high-definition 720p and
1080i signals). Again, like the Avia PRO, this is probably overkill for most
folks (you can probably have a pro calibrate your display for less
money), but we wanted to let you know this was out there.
 Sound & Vision Home Theater Tune-up: This one is also produced 
by Ovation Software, but in conjunction with Sound & Vision magazine
(one of our favorites). In addition to general display calibration, this 
disc includes tests that demonstrate aspect ratios and let you test your
S-Video and component video outputs on your DVD player (to see which
works better in your system). You can find the disc (priced at only $21.95)
at http://shop.soundandvisionmag.com.
We like all three of these discs and would be hard pressed to recommend one.
The Avia and Sound & Vision discs are probably the best bet for regular people
(in other words, people who aren’t trained video calibrators). Video Essentials
is geared more for the professional. Avia is probably a bit more detailed and
comprehensive, whereas the Sound & Vision disc is a bit easier for first-time
users. Either one (any of the three, actually) gives you a better picture.
Though none are available yet, we fully expect that high-definition versions of
these discs will be available in the new Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats that are
hitting the market as we write. Given the relatively low price of the traditional
discs we discuss above, we don’t recommend that you wait for the high-def
versions, but if these are available when you are building your home theater,
they’ll probably be worth purchasing.
When you buy one of these discs, you’ll notice that a blue filter comes in the
package. Don’t toss it in the trash on the mistaken assumption that it’s an
especially pretty piece of packaging — you need this filter when adjusting
some of the color and tint settings on your display. You look through the
filter to block out certain light frequencies.
Using one of these discs is a fairly simple process — one we don’t try to re-
create here step by step because the on-screen audio and text instructions
do a better job than we can in a book. Before you adjust any of these settings,
get up off your comfy home theater seating and close the blinds! Ambient
lighting has an immense effect on what you see on your screen (regardless of
what type of display you have). So lower the blinds, close the door, and dim
the lights. You want to adjust your picture in exactly the same lighting condi-
tions that you’ll have when you sit down to play movies or watch TV in your
home theater. Then just follow the instructions on the DVD, step-by-step. It’s
easy, and it’s even kind of fun.
When you’re all done, you’ll notice that your picture looks different. (We sure
hope it does!) It’s going to look darker. If you’re not used to a calibrated video
picture, this might be a bit disconcerting. Give yourself some time to get used
284
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

to it, though, and you’ll notice a more detailed picture, a picture that looks
more like the movies. And isn’t that what you’re after in a home theater?
Some displays come from the factory either pretty well calibrated or with a
picture mode you can select on your remote that will set your picture close 
to the state it would be in after you manually calibrated it. Sony displays are
famous for this (Sony calls this their “Pro” mode), as are some of the high-
end displays made by Loewe (www.loewe.de) and Princeton Graphics
(www.princetongraphics.com). Read the reviews before you buy.
Although you still may want to tweak the display a bit with a calibration disc,
it’s very handy to have it be 99 percent of the way there with the push of a
single button (or right out of the box).
Using an optical comparator
If you want to get really fancy with your home theater calibration process,
you might consider not relying on your eyeballs and instead use a tool called
an optical comparator or a colorimeter. These devices are simply machines
that can analyze the colors and patterns on a screen with a much higher
degree of accuracy than you’ll be able to do with your naked eyes.
Using an optical comparator or colorimeter can be especially useful if you are
one of those folks with some degree of color blindness (which can include,
depending on which study you believe, up to 1 in 12 men).
For the most part, these color-sensing devices are too expensive for the aver-
age home theater — you can buy a 50-inch high-definition plasma TV for the
price of many common hardware kits. For example, Ovation Multimedia’s
OpticONE system, a popular hardware and software solution, retails for
$2,200. Consequently, many folks turn to professional system calibrators (dis-
cussed in the upcoming section, “Hiring a professional”) who can amortize
this investment over a number of customers.
But there are solutions that are in the price range of mere mortals, like
ColorVision’s Datacolor SpyderTV ($249, www.colorvision.com). (The
SpyderTV is so named because it has spiderlike suction-cup legs that stick 
to your display — ignoring the fact that it has three, not eight legs!).
To use the SpyderTV you simply stick the unit’s suction cups to the front of
your display and then plug the USB cable running out of the SpyderTV into
your computer (Windows 2000 or XP is required, and a laptop is a heck of a
lot more convenient for this task but is not required). Then place the sup-
plied test pattern DVD in your DVD player and you’re ready to start.
For flat-panel plasma and LCD displays, the SpyderTV includes a special 
suction-cup attachment device — you’re not supposed to use the suction
cups built into the three legs of the SpyderTV for these kinds of displays.
285
Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System

After everything is hooked up, you just need to follow the steps included in the
SpyderTV software running on your PC (it comes on a separate CD with the
rest of the SpyderTV gear). Have your display’s remote handy and follow the
on-screen steps to tweak your TV’s display settings. This all takes 40 minutes
or more, so have a little patience (that’s one reason why the pros charge hun-
dreds of dollars to do a calibration), but the end result should be a better and
more lifelike picture.
Although we didn’t have a big issue with this personally, some folks have
complained that it’s a bit tricky to get the SpyderTV attached to your display.
You may want to consider mounting the unit on a tripod in front of your dis-
play if the suction cups don’t work well for you.
Other tuning system options
If you haven’t had a chance to get your hands on one of the home theater 
calibration discs, but you still want to improve your picture, you can do a
couple of things.
One way to get a subset of the video tests on these discs is to play a movie
DVD that contains the THX Optimizer. You find this somewhere in the disc’s
main menu (usually in the Special Features section). Like the discs we
describe earlier, the Optimizer walks you through a series of steps to adjust
your display (and your audio system). All THX-certified DVDs released since
2000 (including Pat’s daughter’s favorite, The Lion King) include the THX opti-
mizer. You can find more detail, including instructions on THX’s Web site
(www.thx.com/mod/products/dvd/optimizerIntro.html). Now if he
could just teach her to calibrate the plasma for him . . . ; maybe when she
turns 3 she’ll be able to!
You can find more detail, including instructions on THX’s Web site (www.
thx.com/mod/products/dvd/optimizerIntro.html).
With this program, you still need that blue filter; if you didn’t get one with the
DVD itself (and you probably didn’t), you can get one for free from THX by
filling out the order form on-line. (You do have to pay a couple of bucks for
shipping and handling.)
We recommend that you at least rent one of the movies on the THX Web site
so you can use the Optimizer. You can adjust your video just by eyeballing it.
We recommend that, at a minimum, you turn down the brightness until the
level is about 1⁄3 of the way across your screen, but using a test disc or the
Optimizer is much, much easier and more accurate.
286
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

One way to get your display dialed in at least somewhat close to an optimal
calibration is to read the posts about your particular TV or monitor on the
AVS Forum Web site (www.avsforum.com). Many models have ongoing
threads for owners, and you’ll often find other people’s calibration advice
within these forums. Remember that not every unit is going to be exactly the
same. (There are always at least minor variations in manufacturing, and over
time, the settings can change a bit — for example, as a projector’s light bulb
gets dimmer.) But you can at least find out what works for other folks and try
it out as an initial setting until you do a more formal calibration.
Hiring a professional
You may decide — either right up front or after you realize that you just can’t
handle that remote control very well — that you want a professional to cali-
brate your display. Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, if you can
afford it, we highly recommend that you consider having a professional cali-
brate your system. They have tools (such as light meters) that you just don’t
have, and their calibration is more precise and ultimately better than any-
thing you can do with a calibration DVD and your eyeballs.
287
Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System
Getting your projector in focus
If you have a projection TV system (front or rear)
and it uses cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to create
its picture, getting your set calibrated is a bit
more intense. In addition to all the color/
hue/sharpness/brightness/contrast stuff we
discuss elsewhere in this chapter, you need to
converge these displays. Converging is the
process of aligning the three separate CRTs
(one each for red, green, and blue) inside these
projectors so that the image projected by each
CRT is exactly superimposed onto the other two.
Misconvergence is obvious when you see it (the
edges of images are red, green, and blue
“halos” instead of a single sharp image) and is
really painful to watch.
For most CRT projection systems, you need a
professional to calibrate the convergence of
your display. A few rear-projection models
(RPTVs), from companies such as Hitachi
(www.hitachi.com), are now available with
automatic convergence systems. Just a few
years ago (in the mid 1990s), this feature alone
cost more (as an option for expensive projector
systems) than an entire HDTV-ready RPTV with
automatic convergence does today. How about
that for capitalism in action? Even if you have a
set with automatic convergence, you might still
consider a professional calibration to get the
ultimate picture from your RPTV, but the auto-
matic convergence is much better than doing
nothing.

If you have a CRT front-projection system, you really must have a professional
set it up. You’ll waste tens of thousands of dollars if you don’t. In fact, if you’re
buying any high-end display (such as that $17,000 61-inch HDTV plasma dis-
play Pat has his eye on — don’t tell his wife!), go for a professional calibration.
When you start getting into this price range, you should really expect this kind
of service from your home theater dealer. A professional calibration usually
costs between $200 and $500, depending on what type of display you have.
If you choose to have a professional calibration done, make sure you 
choose someone who has been certified and trained by the Imaging Science
Foundation, or ISF (we mention them earlier in the chapter, as you might
recall). The ISF has trained (and continues to train) literally thousands of
home theater dealers in the art of system calibration. You can find a trained
calibration professional near you by searching on ISF’s Web site at www.
imagingscience.com.
Don’t call ISF directly asking them to calibrate your system. Those folks know
how to do it, but they’re in the business of training others, not coming over
to your house.
Adjusting Your Audio System
Just as your display needs a tune-up to look its best, your A/V receiver (or
A/V controller, if you’ve gone with separates) needs a once-over to ensure
you get the best possible sound from your home theater. You need to do the
initial setup to make sure that your A/V receiver knows what kind of speakers
288
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Great DVDs to put your system through its paces
After your video system is calibrated and ready
to go, it’s time to start watching some movies.
Why not enjoy the view with some real classics
and with some newer movies that can really
test the limits of your system’s capabilities. For
some reason, most home theater enthusiasts
love action movies (but hey, who doesn’t?) and
trot out their well-worn copies of Terminator 2
and The Matrix. These are indeed fun to watch
in your home theater, and they can be demand-
ing discs (The Matrix, in particular, seemed to
overpower many early DVD players), but you
also might want to check out some other films
that show off your home theater in subtler ways.
The ISF (yep, the same guys we mention else-
where in this chapter) has a list of films that it
recommends to its affiliated dealers as great
demo discs. You can find this list on-line at
www.filmsondisc.com/ISF_Referen
ce_DVD_Program.htm. You may even be
surprised to find favorites like Muppets from
Space and Wayne’s World — excellent!

you’re using, and then you need to adjust the amplification levels for each
speaker.
Get out your A/V receiver’s manual before you start doing any of the stuff we
recommend. Your particular receiver may have different (but similar) termi-
nology. The manual can also help you navigate your receiver’s setup menu
system.
Managing bass
Your A/V receiver sends low-frequency sounds to your subwoofer through 
its LFE (or low frequency effects) channel. Subwoofers are very good at one
thing — reproducing bass notes — and not much good at anything else.
Generally speaking, you want to send only the lowest possible frequencies to
the subwoofer because you want to minimize the use of the subwoofer for
relatively higher frequencies.
At the same time, you must balance this requirement with the needs of your
other speakers. If you have a set of small bookshelf speakers for your center,
right, left, and surround speakers, and they can’t reproduce bass notes very
well, you’re better off letting the subwoofer handle nearly all the bass.
You need to set the speaker size for each group of speakers — center, front
(or main), and surrounds. So Step 1 in setting up your audio is to go into your
A/V receiver’s setup or configuration menu and navigate to the menu that lets
you select your speaker size. You typically have a choice of Large or Small.
The Small setting cuts off the low frequencies that are sent to your main
speakers (the speakers other than your subwoofer) at a higher frequency
than does the Large setting. In other words, the Small setting sends almost 
all low-frequency audio signals to the subwoofer, whereas the Large setting
sends the low frequencies to both the subwoofer and your other speakers.
You’ll probably find a setting in this menu for the subwoofer — an On or
None setting that indicates the presence or absence of the subwoofer. Make
sure you select On if you have a subwoofer.
You can use two criteria to select a setting for your speakers:
 Frequency range of your speakers (best): If you have access to the man-
ufacturer’s data about your speaker, find out the frequency range at
which the manufacturer rates its speakers. (You may also find this infor-
mation from a reviewer who has tested the speakers.) If the low end of
the speaker’s frequency response is rated below 40 Hz, set your receiver
to the Large setting; otherwise, use the Small setting.
289
Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System

 Woofer size (not as good): If you don’t know how low your speakers can
go, you can use the size of your speaker’s woofers as a rule of thumb. If
the woofers are 6 inches or larger, try the Large setting; otherwise, go
with the Small setting.
If you don’t know either of these things (you can always take off the speaker’s
grill and measure the woofer), start off with the Large setting. You can always
switch over to the Small setting if you notice that your main speakers aren’t
handling the bass very well. (In other words, they’re causing audible distor-
tions with low-frequency audio tracks.)
If you don’t have a subwoofer in your system, make sure you set the front
speakers to the Large setting and set the subwoofer control to Off. Even if
your other speakers are small, you need to select Large here, or you’ll get
absolutely no bass from your system.
Setting up surrounds
After your speakers are put in the right place (see Chapter 17), turned on,
and you’ve selected sizes, it’s time to configure your surround system. You
need to configure two settings, which we describe below, and then expand
upon in greater detail later in this section:
 Delay: If all your speakers are the same distance from your listening
position, sounds emanating from them arrive at your ears at the same
time. That’s a good thing because delays in the arrival of sounds can
ruin your sound field. You want sounds to have delays only when the
director of the movie intends it (like when a footfall echoes behind you). If
speakers aren’t equidistant from the listening position, your A/V receiver
can compensate with its own delay settings.
 Channel Balance (or level): Set the sound level of each speaker so 
that you hear an equal volume from each speaker during testing. If one
speaker (or set of speakers) is too loud, you experience an unbalanced
sound field while listening to your system. (When you play back actual
movies or music, the volume coming from each speaker depends on the
volumes encoded in the source material.)
A growing number of A/V receivers have a built-in calibration tool that uses
either a microphone that’s built into the receiver itself or (more commonly)
an accessory microphone that comes with the receiver or that you buy sepa-
rately. These systems let you skip all of the steps that follow by simply invok-
ing the auto calibration command on the receiver. A computer within the
receiver sends out test tones and automatically adjusts the receiver’s set-
tings. Some people think that they can do a better job manually — with an
290
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

SPL meter, discussed in the next section, or with the audio portion of one of
the video test discs discussed above — but for the average person (and by
that we mean any non–audio geek!), these automated calibration systems are
a lifesaver.
Setting the delay
Depending upon your A/V receiver, you’ll find two ways to set the delay: You
can enter either a distance or a delay time (in milliseconds). In either case,
get a tape measure and measure the distance from your listening position 
to each group of speakers (center, front, and surround). You should have to
measure only one speaker from each group, because the left and right speak-
ers within a group should be equidistant from your listening position. If your
receiver uses distance, simply enter the number of feet that you’ve just mea-
sured for each group of speakers.
If the receiver uses delay settings in milliseconds, things get a bit more com-
plicated. Typically, the delay settings are measured in relation to the main
(right and left) speakers, so you enter a delay for the center channel and for
the surround channel (or channels in 6.1- or 7.1-channel systems). To do this,
compare the distance of the group you are setting to the distance of the main
speakers. If the speakers are farther away, you typically set the delay to 0 mil-
liseconds (because the added distance will naturally add a delay — so you
don’t want to artificially increase this delay). If they are closer than the main
speakers, you set the delay to 1 millisecond for each foot. For example, if
your main speakers are 9 feet from your listening position, and your center
channel is 7 feet away, set the delay for 2 milliseconds.
Adjusting the channel balance
Your A/V receiver will have a special Test Tone mode designed for setting
your channel balance. When you enter into this mode, the receiver generates
a series of tones (at an equal amplification level) to each individual speaker
in your system. The tone comes out of only one speaker at a time and shifts
from speaker to speaker (either automatically or when you press a button on
the remote control). The goal of this test is for you to set the level of each
individual speaker until you hear an equal volume from each speaker.
Even though this test tone starts off with an equal amplification level for each
speaker, you may (and probably will) hear a different volume level on the first
round of the test. That’s because different speakers have different sensitivi-
ties. (We discuss sensitivity in Chapter 12; it’s a measure of how loud a
speaker plays with a given power input.) Even if you had five identical speak-
ers in your home theater (with the same sensitivity), their distance from your
seating position and their acoustic interactions with the room can affect the
volume you hear at your listening position.
291
Chapter 19: Tweaking Your A/V System

As you run through your receiver’s test mode, you can adjust the volume
level of each individual speaker. Most people can do a good — not great, but
very good — job at this by using their ears alone. To get your channel bal-
ance really nailed down, consider purchasing an inexpensive sound-level
meter (known as an SPL — sound pressure level — meter). You can get a
good one for under $50 from Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com). With a
meter in hand, you can get a really accurate channel balance setting. An even
better approach is to mount the meter on a tripod at your seating position —
that’s how the pros do it.
The test tones are also a good check to make sure your speaker wires are
hooked up to the right speaker terminals on the back of your receiver (or
power amplifier if you’re using separates). The receiver’s display (or on-
screen display) tells you what speaker you should be hearing each tone from.
If the display says left surround and you hear a tone from your right sur-
round, you know that you’ve made a mistake!
Dealing with old-fashioned stereo sources
Although most movies are designed for surround sound listening, music is
generally recorded in stereo and mixed, edited, and produced for systems
with two speakers. CDs, radio, cassette tapes, and LPs are all stereo record-
ings. In the audio-only realm, only DVD-Audio and SACD provide multichannel
surround sound–ready recordings. Indeed, not all these recordings are multi-
channel, as many SACDs are stereo-only.
If you take a look around your home theater, you’ll see that you have at least
five speakers (not counting the subwoofer). What’s an audiophile to do?
292
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 
Using test discs
The home theater calibration discs we discuss
elsewhere in this chapter — such as the Avia
disc — are for more than just adjusting the
video settings on your display. They also have
relatively robust and elaborate audio setup sec-
tions that can supplement the test tones built
into your receiver.
For example, in addition to test tones for setting
channel balance, the Avia disc has a test 
that lets you verify the phase of each of your
speakers. Just follow the instructions on the
screen, and you can find out if you’ve acciden-
tally wired one of your speakers with the nega-
tive and positive terminals crossed. You can
even get into more advanced tests, such as
checking for room interactions with your speak-
ers (if you’re working on tweaking your speak-
ers’ positioning in the room) and voice
matching, which helps you decide whether cer-
tain speakers work well together.

Well, most A/V receivers let you select whether you want to listen to stereo
recordings in stereo, or direct, mode (through the front left and right speak-
ers) or in a surround mode (using all your speakers). Which you use is really
your preference. A/V receivers can use Dolby Pro Logic II or a custom sur-
round mode (discussed later in this chapter) to artificially create surround
effects for these stereo recordings.
We prefer playing back our CDs and other stereo sources in the stereo mode.
It just seems more realistic to us. If you like the surround modes, feel free to
use them. It’s your theater, so use it the way that makes you happiest.
Most TV shows are broadcast in stereo, and many older movies on DVD or VHS
are stereo as well. For movies and TV programming in stereo (not in Dolby
Digital or DTS), we like to use Dolby Pro Logic II to create surround sound.
Playing with custom surround modes
As we discuss in Chapter 11, A/V receivers and controllers use devices called
DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) to decode surround sound signals. These
DSPs are basically powerful computer chips that can do all sorts of neat
manipulations of audio signals. They’re designed to tweak signals, not crunch
numbers like the computer chips in your PC.
Many receiver manufacturers — the majority of them, to be honest — have
harnessed this computer horsepower to create custom surround modes (or
DSP modes), which manipulate the audio signal and create artificial surround
sound modes. These custom surround modes use computer-generated
models to adjust the volume and delay of signals coming from the surround
and center channels in order to reproduce different “venues.” For example,
some receivers have a mode that tries to re-create the ambience of a cathe-
dral by reproducing the delays and echoes you’d hear in a real cathedral.
Most audiophiles despise these custom surround modes, feeling that they are
artificial and just get in the way of the music. We tend to agree; but again, this
is an area in which we leave you to your own devices. Feel free to play around
with these modes and see what you think. We won’t come to your house and
turn them off if you like them.

Building off the discussion in Chapter 2 about where to put your home the-

If you are building a home from scratch or renovating an area for your home
theater, you have a lot to think about. But even if you are just sprucing up
your living room or that room over the garage, this chapter has a few tips for
you, too.
We want to warn you in advance that some of the topics in this chapter require
pretty intense construction. You need to do more research on-line and consult
with your manufacturers and contractor, if you have one, to determine your
exact course of action. We give you some manufacturers’ Web addresses as we
discuss different options, and we point out good resources as we go along.
Mounting Your (Expensive) 
Display (Carefully!)
One of the biggest advances in TV displays in recent years has been the depth
of the units — displays are getting thinner and thinner. Instead of just plunking

your new display on top of a table, consider mounting it on the wall or ceiling
(such as in the case of projectors) instead.
Mounting a display can be easy if you plan and design well up front. As you
will read, there’s more than one way to mount a display. You should ask your-
self some questions about how you intend to use your TV before you settle
on a particular mounting approach:
 Is viewing flexibility an important consideration? If you want to be
able to see the display from two different locations, a swing arm mount
is great — you can merely swing the display around to face the desired
room. You might do this, for example, so that you can watch your
plasma TV in the family room, but then swing it out so that it can be
viewed from the kitchen, too. It’s great for watching cooking shows!
 Where do you want to put the display in the room? Plan for your
cabling in advance. Are you mounting this on a brick wall or in front of a
window? In these instances, a ceiling mount may be better because it
will be easier to run your cables invisibly.
If you are interested in a better understanding of how to prepare your
home for all your digital home wiring needs, check out our Smart Homes
For Dummies (Wiley), which deals with whole-home networking of all
types.
 Are you planning on mounting your display over a fireplace? It can
get hot over a fireplace in use, and this heat can damage your display. A
lot of TVs don’t have a cooling fan — they use convection for cooling
and have to be five inches from the wall. If you are short on space and
cooling is a concern, look for a TV with a fan. If there is a lot of heat
coming up from the fireplace, you will really need a mantel to deflect the
heat away from your TV.
 How do you want to use your display? Will you want to view this while
lying on the floor sometimes and on the couch at other times? You might
want a swing mount with a high degree of pitch so that you can change
the angle as you desire. Do you want to press a button and have the dis-
play automatically appear? Look for pop-up and ceiling automated prod-
ucts for this purpose — often used in places like apartments in the city,
where you might have limited space.
If you intend to use a swing mount and have chosen to buy third-party
(that is, non-display-driven) speakers, you will want to make sure you
can purchase an add-on accessory to mount your center speaker onto
the display itself, rather than bolting that particular speaker to a wall.
Doing so ensures that your center speaker swings along with the TV . . .
thus avoiding that embarrassing situation in which lips move in one
place but the corresponding dialogue comes from another — yech!

 Is this room subject to different lighting during different times of the
day? Pitch wall mounts — ones that can shift a display up and down —
are good for rooms that have glare during certain times of the day.
 Is this a permanent installation or something you might change as newer
TV display models come out? Many homes trade up TVs every few years
and swap TV sets from room to room in a hand-me-down fashion. Auto-
mated lift mounts are pretty permanent installations in most instances.
 How does this have to look? Is decor an issue? If you need this to be
really flush with the wall with all your cables well hidden, then you might
want to go with a swing arm (as opposed to a static) mount because a
swing arm allows you to use a recessed area in the wall. You can connect
the mount to the wall and then pull out the mount and connect all the
cables and display. When you are done, you can push the mount back
against the wall, and you have a fashionable flush installation. You may
not be able to do this with a static mount because it’s harder to hide all
the connected cables. Also, you can design your mounting so that you
can go with artwork that slides over the display or opt for a decorative
trim to the display. You can even buy a certain material to cover your dis-
play that acts like a mirror when the display is off but is transparent
when the display is on. Pretty “James Bond” if you ask us!
 Do you care about specific orientations for your display? With some
mounts, you can rotate your display into a vertical position. If you are
into photography, the display can go into portrait mode, for instance, for
those vertically oriented pictures. Or, you might want to view the dis-
play horizontally but store it vertically, if space is a consideration.
Understanding your mounting options
You’ll run into three basic types of mounts:
 Flat-panel mounts: These are designed predominantly for plasma dis-
plays and LCDs. You will find versions for ceiling, wall, and pole mounts
(for floor-based mounting). Flat-panel mounts can be static, pitch, and
swing mounts. Static mounts don’t move. Pitch mounts pivot the display
up and down. Swing mounts articulate up and down and side-to-side.
 Projector mounts: Projector mounts are generally based around one
design, but they tend to come with a lot of accessories that let you use
the mount on a ceiling or wall, deal with a drop ceiling, and so on.
 Automated solutions: For superslick installations, projector ceiling lifts
and pop-up plasma lifts hide your gear when not in use. You can also
297
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment

automate swing arms so that, with the press of a button, your TV swings
into a preprogrammed position.
If you’re thinking about an automated solution, there’s a whole different
level of expertise typically required in order to manage the environmen-
tal, electrical, and other design elements of a successful implementation.
These are generally not do-it-yourself projects. If you’re looking for help
mounting a display, we recommend that you check with your home the-
ater dealer, look on the mount manufacturer’s Web site, or look for
installers in the “homeowners” section on the CEDIA (Custom Electronic
Design and Installation Association) Web site at www.cedia.ne.
What to look for in a mount
When looking for a mount, consider these attributes of a manufacturer and
its products:
 Design/ease of installation: Look for mounts with a lot of open space
within their structures so you have a lot of room to do everything else you
need to do when mounting a display. Check for a wall plate with minimal
surface area so that you have more flexibility in where your cable and elec-
trical outlets are located. There’s nothing worse than finding that your elec-
trical outlet is hidden by a big piece of unnecessary metal. Also, look for
“hands-free” wall mount installations. The best designs allow one person 
to install them — for example, Chief Manufacturing’s flat-panel mounts
(www.chief.com) allow you to pound a nail in the wall and temporarily
mount the whole unit on that one nail, leaving your hands free for leveling
and final bolting. Some swing arms can be heavy — they can weigh up to
50 pounds — so again you will want to be able to pre-install the top two lag
bolts and then slide the mount over those bolts — leaving the remaining
bolts easier to install. Less-installer-friendly units don’t have such slide-on
options — all the bolt holes are encircled with metal so you have to screw
the bolt in while holding the mount to the wall. (As an installer, you make
the mistake of installing a mount out-of-level only once.)
 Ease of use: Ease of adjustment after installation is important. You
should be able to adjust the tilt of a mount with a push of your fingertip.
When you move a display, it should stay there without having to tighten
knobs. Truly, this is the test of a high-quality mount.
 Weight capacity: Make sure the mount is rated not only for your display,
but also for any speakers, decorative trim, and other accessories that
can add weight.
We suggest that you look for mounts that are UL (Underwriters Laborato-
ries) listed. These are tested at several times their rated weight capacity,
so you’re less likely to have a failure should your annoying in-law lean
up against the mount during your annual holiday party.
298
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

 Range of motion (tilt, swivel, extension, and so on): Make sure that the
mount not only fits in your space, but also provides the range of motion
desired when the size of the mounted display is taken into account.
We’ve seen instances in which someone bought a mount with the expec-
tation of a 45-degree angle, only to find that, because of the size of the
display and the limited extension from the wall, the full 45 degrees could
not be achieved.
 Integrated cable management: You will want to hide your cables. Spend
time understanding how your wiring will be run. This is especially true
for ceiling mounts in which the cabling may go through the center of the
pipe. More than one installer has been tripped up trying to thread a
wide DVI or HDMI connector through a too-thin mount-extension column
for a projector. If you have to run cables outside of your installation, for
whatever reason, check for snap-on covers that help hide the cables
even when run outside the mount columns.
Be careful of ceiling mounts that have a flange at the top — make sure
you understand how you will route the cables out of that flange if you
are, say, mounting this to concrete. There are instances in which cabling
run through the center of a mount cannot “get out” of the column due to
the nature of the mounting surface itself.
 Quick detach/attach capability: If you ever have to remove your display —
to change the filters or lamps in a projector, for instance — you want a
mount that was designed to maintain all the mechanical settings of the
mount itself. You don’t want to have to reset and reconfigure your gear
each time you put it back.
 Integrated lateral shift capability: While awfully techie sounding, lateral
shift is merely the ability to install a mount off center, when taking into
account the spacing of the studs in your walls. After all, it would be just
dumb luck if the spacing of the studs happened to perfectly coincide
with where you wanted to center your display. A high-quality mount will
allow you to displace your mount at least 4 inches to the left or right
with 16-inch or 24-inch centered studs. An installed display should be
able to be positioned vertically as well — quality mounts allow for at
least 3 inches of vertical shift.
 Aesthetics: Look for mounts that look good to you. Check for multiple
colors to choose from. Low-profile mounts are important, and details
count, like covers for lag bolts on the wall.
 Quality: While it’s hard to judge quality as an amateur, obvious indica-
tions, like being UL-approved, are a good sign that a manufacturer cares
about its quality image.
 Don’t go cheap on your mount: A good mount will last you many TV dis-
plays. Consider the future when making your purchase . . . nickle-and-
diming here will only hurt you later.

Tips for installing your mount
So you have your mount picked out and you’re ready to install. Here are
some tips to make sure you have as successful an installation as possible:
 Pick the right fasteners for the job. There are specific anchors for spe-
cific types of wood. We won’t make you writhe through stories of home-
owners who tried to mount a 50-inch plasma with drywall screws. Most
mounting instructions start with the assumption of wood stud installa-
tions, but there are specialty kits with most mounts for concrete anchors,
drywall anchors, metal studs, and so on. Don’t go cheap here; your home-
owner’s insurance probably has a big deductible, and you don’t want to
have to use it. A good rule to plan around: Your anchors need to hold
five times the weight of what you are putting on the mount. Most manu-
facturers test their products with 5⁄16-inch lag bolts (some use 3⁄8-inch) — 
a 21⁄2-inch-long lag bolt is generally acknowledged to be acceptable for
large mounts. The main goal is to hit the center of your stud with the
bolt. To be sure you do, drill pilot holes to find the width of the stud so
you can determine its exact center.
 Range of motion/clearance requirements. On most mounts, the display
is lowered onto the mount. This means you need to have a little more
clearance above the mount to make sure you can slide the display into
place. Generally, this ranges from 4 inches to 1⁄2 an inch of extra space,
depending on the manufacturer. So if you have a really tight space, think
about this in advance. If you are installing an electric lift for a plasma
display or LCD, know that these lifts are generally wide open to the ele-
ments in its hidden state — so if you lift this into an attic that has no
moisture controls, the plasma will be exposed when not lowered into the
house. (That’s bad, in case you needed us to tell you that.) Projector
lifts, on the other hand, tend to be enclosed in a box that has a plenum
rating (meaning they’re safe for installation in air flow areas — they have
special fireproof coatings) and can go in a false ceiling.
 Properly gauge your wall structure to make sure it can hold the
weight. Having a top-of-the-line mount that is secured to a wall studded
with 2-x-2-inch wall studs won’t get you far with a 60-inch display. The
bigger the display, the more you may need to create a special mounting
structure to support the mount — and you’ll probably want to call in the
cavalry (that is, a professional).
 Triple-check your measurements (and then ask your spouse to recheck
them for you). Use the actual screen and mount when taking measure-
ments, and where possible, confirm your measurements by holding the
equipment in the space itself. Having good lateral and vertical shift will
help, but that can cover up only the most minor of mistakes.
 Consider hiring a professional installer. This is one area you don’t want
to mess up. There’s no honor in a broken 36-inch LCD screen. The more
precise the installation needs to be, the more likely it is you will need to
hire a professional to help.

Soundproofing and Improving Acoustics
No matter how good your system, if you put it in an environment that is not
geared toward good sound quality, even the best audio system will sound hor-
rible. The room’s construction, furnishings, and window and wall treatments
have a massive impact on the quality of sound from your home theater.
Many of the rooms chosen for home theaters are substantially less than opti-
mal from a sound perspective. Your biggest enemy is vibration. Just about
everything — the walls, the ductwork, suspended light fixtures, the drop 
ceiling — can vibrate. When a subwoofer produces its strong low-frequency
acoustic energy, that sound wave travels through the room, hitting walls and
ceiling surfaces. It’s absorbed by the walls, which vibrate in reaction to this
energy. This vibration then is conducted through any solid surface that it’s in
contact with it, including studs, joists, and flooring. From there, it travels up
301
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Adding that extra touch
Some available accessories for your mounted
display can really add to its attractiveness in
your house (that is, if black matte finish doesn’t
turn you on as much as it does Pat). For
instance, you can get old-style picture frames
that make a display look more like a painting on
the wall than a TV.
Many home theater sites carry “masking” sys-
tems that will also hide your screen altogether.
For instance, BEI Audio/Visual Products (www.
beionline.com) has something called the
BEI Motorized Artwork System that is designed
for raising and lowering a framed canvas art-
work to conceal or reveal a plasma display. Just
tap a button and the canvas slides away and the
NCAA basketball tournament game comes on.
The system offers more than 300 reproductions
of works by the Great Masters — Monet,
Manet, Millet . . . you have a broad selection of
the most popular works of art. (Danny’s partial
to Caillebotte’s “Nude on a Couch” but is pretty
sure his wife won’t agree.) You pick from a
range of more than a dozen classic wooden
frames to match your decor. A BEI system will
cost you around $2,500.
(Curiously, BEI has the option of shipping the
unit with bulletproof glass. We’ve heard of
hating a picture, but that’s a little extreme.
However, if you really need to protect that
plasma, this product’s for you!)
Of course, no picture-framed display would be
complete without digital art. Get a Roku Labs HD
Photobridge (www.rokulabs.com, $399) to
push high-definition pictures to your display.
(We discuss this product more in Chapter 22.)
Or, if you have your PC connected to the screen,
check out GalleryPlayer Media Networks
(www.galleryplayer.com). GalleryPlayer
is a digital home gallery service that delivers
museum-quality art and photography to any
high-definition display, transforming it into a dig-
ital canvas. The application is free, and you can
display hundreds of free images, as well as
browse premium (i.e. “for-pay”) services con-
taining individual pictures and collections that
will turn your screen into an art gallery. Images

through the framing of the house, and you end up with a shaking house,
making a special noise of its own. That’s where you need sound planning
(pun intended).
You want to try to control two major types of sound distortions:
 Intrusive sounds from outside your home theater (and, to be fair, sounds
from inside the home theater that seep into the house and keep Mom
and Dad awake until the end of the midnight movie)
 Sound reflections and refractions from the audio system itself
If you are building a new home from scratch or renovating, you have the
opportunity to address this at the architectural level. You essentially want to
create a room within a room so that you can isolate and control the impact of
the sound system’s signals on the room itself. Seek to isolate your inside
walls, ceilings, and floors from the rest of the house as much as possible. The
following list gives you some ideas on how best to go about this task:
 Place studs appropriately, double your drywall, and insulate for
sound. You want to avoid having the studs of two adjacent walls touch-
ing each other. By keeping studs from touching, you cut off a primary
means for sound to travel between the room and the house (in both
directions). You can also dull vibrations by adding a second layer of 
drywall.
To further dampen any sounds, apply insulation inside the wall cavity. (If
this is a concrete basement, you need to consider a vapor barrier as well
to keep moisture out of your home theater.)
 Apply soundproofing between studs and drywall. Consider adding a
layer of soundproofing material between the studs and drywall. This
serves not only to suppress sounds going back and forth, but also as a
vibration trap between the drywall and the studs themselves — further
reducing unintended effects from your sound system. For instance,
Acoustiblok (www.acoustiblok.com) sells a very effective sound bar-
rier that comes in rolls like tarpaper.
When applying soundproofing layers, keep it somewhat limp between
the studs so it can absorb the acoustic energy more efficiently. Also,
soundproofing materials are usually pretty heavy, so be sure to buy
some prime steaks and beer before you ask your neighbors to help!
 Apply soundproofing to the floor. Think about a floating floor, which is
a multilayered floor designed to isolate your home theater from the rest
of the house. For example, the topmost floating layer might consist of
tongue-and-groove chipboard bonded to a layer of plasterboard. That in
turn would be laid on a spongy layer made of some sort of mineral fiber.
You could then glue the spongy layer to the existing floor or even mount
the whole thing on its own joists.
302
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

 Apply a soundproofing system to the finished drywall. Adding spe-
cialized sound control panels to the walls can help control unwanted
reflected sounds. When placed at your speakers’ first reflection points
(typically, the sidewall boundaries and rear wall behind the main listen-
ing position), sound treatment panels reduce your reflected sound. (This
reflected sound could cause a blurring of the sound image and lack of
intelligibility.) Sound treatments also reduce the overall sound volume in
the room, enhancing low-level dialogue and environmental effects deliv-
ered over today’s high-quality audio systems.
A good way to find your speakers’ first reflection point is to sit in your
listening position and have one of your home theater–loving buddies
move a mirror along the walls. When a speaker becomes visible in the
mirror (from your perspective in your comfy theater seating), you’ve
found the first reflection point.

Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Who you gonna call?
The following companies offer products that
can be used when soundproofing your walls:
 Kinetics Noise Control (www.kinetics
noise.com): Kinetics Noise Control offers
a Home Theater Absorption Kit that contains
special decorative panels. The midwall
absorptive panels take care of sound rever-
beration, and the triangular corner panels
are specifically engineered to absorb low-
frequency bass sound that tends to gather in
corners. This company also makes special
spring mounts for suspending your ceiling
(so it doesn’t rattle) and other special items
for dampening other sounds in your room.
 Acoustic Sciences
(www.acoustic
sciences.com): Acoustic Sciences has
a neat product called the Acoustical Soffit,
which is a very discreet acoustic treatment
that runs around the ceiling borders of your
room. This architectural acoustic compo-
nent is designed to control low-end bass
responses while also serving as an internal
raceway to hide wiring, HVAC, and lighting.
Pretty neat idea.
 Acoustic Innovations (www.acoustic
innovations.com): When it comes to
in-room soundproofing treatments, there
are many different approaches, and often
your taste in decorations drives your selec-
tion. For instance, Acoustic Innovations has
really nice solid hardwood frames in
mahogany, cherry, walnut, and oak stains
for its Maestro line of panels that can
reduce unwanted sound reflections.
 Additional resources: Check out other
offerings from companies such as Auralex
(www.auralex.com) and Owens Corning
(www.owenscorning.com).
Our friend Jim Millay decided to make his 
own acoustical treatments. He got some stiff
insulation — like you’d put in your house — and
wrapped it with professional-looking fabric —
and voila, instant inexpensive panels. We can’t
really compare these with the professionally
manufactured ones just discussed, but if 
you are on a budget, consider Jim’s approach.
Of course, he’ll want a contribution for his 
idea. . . .

The cost of the materials for soundproofing a home theater fluctuates, depend-
ing on what you decide to do. You can spend a few hundred dollars or upwards
of $35,000. Over time, you’ll probably at least add some of these interior sound
treatments to deal with the sound in the room.
Remember that your cheapest first line of sound defense is simply securing
everything that is around the room and listening for things that add noise.
Subwoofers can definitely shake things up; if that problem rears its ugly head,
get some inexpensive isolation pads for the subwoofer’s feet. Projectors can
make a ton of noise, too; consider a special mounting for the projector that
contains its noise, but remember not to block the fan and airflow because it
puts off a lot of heat, too.
In Chapter 2, we discuss having a central wiring hub and a media hub for
your electronics. People often put these all in a place where they can show
them off, but with that approach comes heat and noise (from cooling fans)
that you must deal with. If you can put all the power amplifiers outside the
room, there is less heat and noise to dissipate, which is something to think
about in your plan.
Dealing with Home Theater Lighting
Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the right atmosphere for your home
theater. A bright light in the wrong place or the wrong glare from an open
window can be just as annoying as someone’s cellphone going off in the
middle of a show.
Most home theater planners agree that the video on your display looks best
when the room lights are off (or significantly dimmed), the doors are closed,
and the shades are drawn. This is where creative use of dimmers, motorized
drapes, window treatments, and a lighting control system can become pivotal
pieces of your home theater environs.
Wall-mounted dimmer switches allow you to control the intensity of an indi-
vidual light or series of connected lights. In most instances, this is a simple
and cheap way to change the ambience, and you can do it with $5 and a trip
to Home Depot.
If you want to have real fun, think about moving to a complete lighting con-
trol system. For as little as $300, you can get into systems designed specifi-
cally for controlling your lights within one room (your home theater). From
either a wall-mounted keypad, a remote control, or both, you can turn on/off,
brighten, dim, or otherwise control each light fixture in the room.
If you choose a sophisticated lighting control system (we talk about a few in
this section), you can actually program the system to do some pretty elaborate
lighting tricks. For example, you might set up a Preshow mode that has lights
304
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

on all over the room, maybe accentuating your bar area or the couches, if
you have them. You could press a Preshow button on your lighting controls
to activate that mode. Then you might have a Viewing mode that would dim
the sconces, cut the overhead lights, initially highlight the front of the home
theater, then fade, open the curtains in front of your home theater, and start
the show. (These different lighting modes are known as scenes.) Way cool.
With not too much more effort, you can use remote controls, like the ones 
we talk about in Chapter 15, and integrate your electronics further. So in
Preshow mode, you can control the music, and in Viewing mode, you can
control the projector or display. With a good system, the macros you can set
up are limitless. (Macros are those stored programs in your remote that let
you perform multiple commands with a single button push, allowing you to
create new modes for whatever mood.)
There are new construction and retrofit solutions for lighting control,
depending on whether you are building from scratch or making a system fit
into your existing space with existing wiring. Systems can communicate via
wireline signaling (using existing AC power lines) or wirelessly. You can get
single-room systems from players such as Leviton (www.leviton.com),
Lightolier Controls (www.lolcontrols.com), LiteTouch (www.lite
touch.com), Lutron (www.lutron.com), Powerline Control Systems
(www.pcslighting.com), SmartHome (www.smarthome.com), Vantage
(www.vantageinc.com), and X10 (the company — www.X10.com).
Lutron’s $1,800 Home Theater Package is also designed for existing rooms
where rewiring isn’t practical. This package includes four dimmers, a table-
top master control, and an infrared receiver so that users can control lights
from their favorite universal or learning IR transmitter. Lutron also has a
higher-end system that sports RadioRA, a wireless, whole-home lighting 
control system that uses radio frequency technology instead of AC power
lines — most lighting systems use the X10 protocol and your home’s power
lines — for signal communication.
X10, INSTEON, Z-Wave, ZigBee, and more
In the not-too-distant past, if you wanted a whole-home lighting system, you
had to install a really expensive package from a brand-name lighting retailer.
Now, many of these same retailers are adopting new industry approaches
that use your home wiring and wireless technologies to provide low-cost
lighting that everyone can afford.
You’ll run across X10 in many instances. X10 is the granddaddy protocol for
controlling (turning on and off and dimming) electrical devices, such as lights
and appliances, through your home’s electrical lines. It has been around for
years, establishing itself to such an extent that it is now an open standard —
meaning that other companies are free to sell devices that use this protocol as
well. All standards-compatible products display an X10-compatible logo on
305
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment

their packaging or on the product itself. When you see this logo, you know that
the product works with other X10 products regardless of the manufacturer.
As you explore the world of X10, you’ll find a bunch of different tools in the
X10 toolbox, but the two that ended up being most applicable to home the-
aters are their wall outlet modules and dimmer switches. X10 modules are
devices that receive and translate X10 signals to control individual lights,
appliances, or other electrical devices. An X10 wall module is a small, box-
shaped device that’s no bigger than the AC plug-in transformers that power
many home appliances, such as telephones and answering machines.
Setting up an X10 module is pretty easy. The module has a standard electrical
plug on the back and a place to plug in your lamp or other device on the front
or bottom. First, turn the device “on” (for example, turn on the light switch),
and then the X10 module turns the device off and on and dims as appropriate.
X10 dimmer switches replace your normal switch and are likewise controlled
via the X10 signals over your electrical lines, or manually by you at the switch.
X10 doesn’t require specific network architecture other than your existing
electrical system to work in a home. X10 sends its control signals from the
controller over your power lines to every outlet in the house. The controller can
have remote control or PC interfaces. Figure 20-1 shows a limited X10 network.

it’s an integrated dual-mesh network that combines wireless radio fre-
quency (RF) with the home’s existing electrical wiring for communica-
tions. (By the way, in case your head just spun around, integrated dual
mesh means that INSTEON can use both RF and powerline signalling at
the same time, in an integrated way.) Homeowners with existing X10 net-
works can migrate to an INSTEON network without having to discard all
their existing X10 devices.
 ZigBee (www.zigbee.org): ZigBee uses only RF transmission instead 
of X10’s powerline transmission protocols to create a home wireless net-
work for home automation. We discuss Control4, a whole-home network-
ing company that uses ZigBee, in Chapter 21.
 Z-Wave (www.z-wavealliance.org): Z-Wave also focuses just on RF,
using a mesh network that hops from location to location in your home —
making it easy to extend the network throughout even a large home.
These are all just different approaches to the same problem. Each offers simi-
lar modules: plug-in dimmers, plug-in on/off switches, wire-in dimmers with
the standard “paddle” design, wire-in dimmers with a keypad, wire-in on/off
switches, and so on.
In choosing from among the X10 successors, here are some thoughts:
 You’re smart to buy an X10 successor rather than X10 proper. We rec-
ommend you look at these new technologies over X10 unless you’ve
already made a commitment to X10.
307
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment

 Be mindful of X10 compatibility. If you have X10 already installed, we
recommend you still look at INSTEON because it is compatible with X10.
 All of these successors work. These represent the next generation 
of home automation and as such provide the best performance for 
your money. Each of these new approaches is sound and has its pros
and cons.
 All of these successors are mesh. Each of these wireless technologies
uses some form of a mesh network, meaning each device in the network
can communicate with each other device and retransmit a signal if it
can’t confirm a signal was received.
 All of these successors can be programmed and controlled through
multiple access points. How multiple are we talking here? How about
computers, Web browsers, mobile phones, remotes, and wall switches,
for starters?
 The number of supported devices should not matter. Z-Wave’s 
addressing scheme allows for only 256 devices. INSTEON and ZigBee
have addressing schemes that allow many thousands of devices to be
added to a network. Some pundits will argue that that matters. We would
be surprised if you need more than 50 addresses in your home, so we
think this is not an issue.
 Wireless frequencies could be a concern, but it’s too early to tell.
INSTEON and Z-Wave use the 900 MHz frequency spectrum to transmit
their wireless signals in the United States; ZigBee primarily uses the 2.4
GHz frequency spectrum, which is also used by Wi-Fi and other wireless
technologies. If you have a lot of 802.11-based systems in your house,
you could conceivably run into issues with a ZigBee system. However,
ZigBee uses all 16 channels in the 2.4 GHz band, and if a channel gets too
noisy, the network moves to a clear channel, so it was designed to deal
with this. It’s not enough for us to get too worried about it in our own
implementations.
In the end, it’s likely to come down to the cost for you to install a particular
set of capabilities in your home — price out each solution and see what
works best for you. Some of these will likely have a package — like a home
theater lighting package — that makes it easy to accomplish what you want.
Such packages are easier to install the first time, and you can grow off of
these as your needs change.
A great resource for ideas about lighting control systems — and your home
theater in general — is Electronic House magazine (www.electronichouse.
com). It’s inexpensive, available on newsstands, and has helpful hints about
how to approach your projects from lots of different angles (including lots of
home theater–specific articles).

Controlling Your Home Theater
Environment Remotely
Many lighting control systems can interface with or drive whole-home
automation capabilities. Although whole-home automation is beyond the
scope of this book (Dare we say it? Why not? Read our Smart Homes For
Dummies book for a whole-home approach), you can get whole-room automa-
tion with many systems.
Many of the better remote controls we discuss in Chapter 15 support home-
automation commands. And some manufacturers offer complementary prod-
ucts that work off the same remotes. For instance, Lutron’s Sivoia (www.
lutron.com/sivoia) motorized shade and drapery system is integrated
with the firm’s GRAFIK Eye, RadioRA, and HomeWorks lighting and home con-
trol systems. Each new control offers Open, Close, Raise, and Lower buttons,
along with three programmable, preset stop locations for shades or draperies.
With this, you can control the dimming of the lights and opening of the
drapes, just like in a real theater.
309
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Hidden advantages of lighting control systems
Although having a lighting control system for
your home theater makes sense, expanding it to
other parts of your home makes even more
sense. In addition to setting the mood in your
home theater, a lighting control system
 Saves money on electricity bills: Want to
turn off all your lights at night and enter
Sleeping mode? One button can do that, no
matter the condition (on/off) of the lights at
that time.
 Adds security: Automatically illuminating
dark halls or that creepy space by the
garage at night not only adds to peace of
mind, but also reduces the likelihood of
problems.
 Supports your lifestyle: Whether it’s really
making sure your kids’ lights are out at 9:30
or automatically turning on your lights when
you drive in the garage, a lighting control
system can help support the way you use
your home.
If you want to find out more about extending
your lighting control system to the rest of your
house, check out Smart Homes For Dummies
(Wiley), which we also wrote.

Closing the drapes and shades 
without leaving the couch
Motorized shade/drape kits are simple to install and can add a professional
touch to your home theater. You can get electronic drapery kits that open
and close on your command. If you have ever installed a drapery rod, a kit is
basically the same thing with a motor.
For instance, the Makita Motorized Drape System (www.smarthome.com) is a
self-contained system for your home theater drapes. You can get a single drape
system or a double drape. You screw in the tracks, mount the drapes, and plug
it in. You can customize the length merely by cutting the tracking. Pretty simple.
You can also get motorized window-treatment hardware from manufac-
turers such as BTX (www.btxinc.com), Hunter Douglas (www.hunter
douglas.com), Lutron (www.lutron.com/sivoia), and Somfy (www.
somfysystems.com).
Check to see if these systems can link to your home automation system as well.
Somfy has announced, at the time of this writing, that its products will support
INSTEON. Because the Somfy automated shades use radio signals for control, it
makes sense to link them to your INSTEON network for remote control using a
switch or tabletop controller — you can even use computer software to sched-
ule the shades to open and close automatically at a certain time of day.

Starry, starry night . . .
Fiber optics can add a really neat effect to any
home theater. Here are some ideas, suggested
by Acoustic Innovations (www.acoustic
innovations.com):
 Starlight fiber optic ceilings: To make your
ceiling look like a nighttime sky, you can
have fiber-optic ceiling panels applied to
your existing ceiling. The panels not only
make your ceiling more fun, but offer
acoustical correction as well. However, you
might find yourself spreading out a blanket
on your home theater floor to watch the
ceiling!
 Infinite starfield panels: What a better
accompaniment to your Pink Floyd Dark
Side of the Moon midnight laser show than
an infinite starfield in your home theater.
These are made of multiple polycarbonate
mirrors and fiber optic lighting and create
an illusion of infinite depth. (Not suggested
for theater ceilings.)
 Fiber-optic carpeting: This carpet is filled
with tiny points of light (50 fiber-optic points
per square foot, to be precise).
 Fiber-optic curtains: These classic, velvety
curtains can twinkle, too. Très chic.
All illuminators come complete with a remote
locatable dimmer, speed control for twinkle, and
an on/off switch. You even get to choose
between a twinkle or color change wheel.
Decisions, decisions.

Turning up the heat from the 
comfort of your recliner
Automation isn’t just lights and drapes. You can monitor and control temper-
ature settings as well. Don’t forget that you need to maintain the temperature
for all those electronic components per manufacturer specs — usually above
55 degrees Fahrenheit at a minimum. If your theater is located in a part of the
house where you might have to warm it up or cool it off in advance, then con-
sider integrating the heating system in your home theater room into your
controller system, too.
311
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Home Theater Environment
Going Hollywood all the way
For those of you who want to really go all the
way with the theater theme, you can buy all
sorts of add-ons to create that atmosphere:
 Personalized home theater intro: Open
each showing with your own customized
one-minute video, just like in the theaters.
(Your DVD player must be able to play DVD-
R for this to work.) For $160 or so for a cus-
tomized DVD from www.htmarket.com,
you can personalize one of five home the-
ater intros, from an awards night theme to
a classic popcorn theme. How fun is that?!
 Specialty rugs: You can get rugs festooned
with stars, film reels, popcorn, and so on. The
cost is about $50 per square yard on average
(but there’s a huge range). HT Market (www.
htmarket.com) has these rugs.
 Posts and ropes: If you wanted that velour
rope and stainless steel post look, you’ve
got it. Expect to spend around $120–$300 a
post and $80–$100 a rope. Maybe there is
some poetic justice about making your boss
wait in line at your home theater! Pat’s
going to buy a set of these the next time
Danny is in town. Check out www.home
cinemaaccessories.com if you’re
interested in picking up some posts and
ropes for yourself.
 Popcorn machines: Complete with the swing
down popping bucket, these $300–$900
machines give you freshly popped popcorn
and that movie theater smell. Check out
www.popcornpopper.com for some
cool models.
 Wall sconces: You can get cool theater
lighting that will give you that interior deco-
rated look on a budget (about $200–$250
apiece). You don’t need to go anywhere spe-
cial for these — you can hit your local hard-
ware store or go to Lowes or Home Depot.
 Film posters: Decorate the outside of your
theater with current and past movie posters,
just like you see while waiting in line to get
your tickets. These run about $10 to $20 for
current films, in their usual 27-x-40-inch for-
mats. Check out www.allposters.com
for new ones or find vintage posters at
places like www.moviemarket.com.
 Sound Edgelits: Add some of these table-
top back-lit signs to let your viewers know
which sound systems you have in your the-
ater. These $225 signs sport Dolby Digital,
THX, DTS, and other surround sound logos.
You can find these and more at places like
www.hometheaterdecor.com and www.
htmarket.com.

Again, without getting waist deep in detail, you can get X10-, ZigBee-, Z-Wave-,
and INSTEON-controlled heating and air conditioning modules that interface
with your environmental controls to
 Make sure they stay within a specified temperature range
 Allow you remote control in case you want to prep your theater
Many of the firms mentioned for lighting control systems also have similar
systems for heating and air cooling. These systems are usually tack-on mod-
ules to their other systems and can cost as little as $30 to $50. A decent bidi-
rectional home automation thermostat will probably run you $200. Check out
www.smarthome.com, www.automatedoutlet.com, and www.X10.com
for some good options. Again, whole-home options cost considerably more
because you start getting into multiple zones and probably several interface
formats. But for your home theater, the ability to preset your environmental
controls from remote locations won’t cost much.
Getting Comfy
Finally, getting comfortable in your home theater means different things to 
different people. To Danny’s wife, it probably means having about 20 large 
pillows from Pier One Imports lying around the floor. To Pat’s wife, it would
mean having theater seats wide enough for Opie the beagle to sit next to her
(with some beagle-proof fabric covering them).
Lucky for you, you have many options for home theater seating comfort:
chairs, couches, and lounges; seating that’s motorized or manual; some with
storage and control compartments; some with speakers built-in . . . the list
goes on.
You’re probably looking at around $300 and up per seat for specialty theater
seating, and seats can quickly get into the $2,000–$3,000 range if you start
piling on the extras. You can really sink money into your seats.
Some things to keep in mind, no matter what you buy:
 Sound implications: You’ll set up your sound system so that no matter
where you sit in your theater, you hopefully have a similar (breathtak-
ing) aural experience. Three couches in a U-shaped configuration may
sound right for you, but make sure that your speaker configuration is
designed to handle it. You may need some additional speakers or differ-
ent capability to support weird configurations. Seating configuration and
speaker configuration simply go hand-in-hand.
312
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

 Visual implications: Although high-backed theater chairs may look good
in the showroom, they can block your rear surround sound speakers. If
you want multiple rows, these high-backed seats may necessitate a tiered
floor (so back-row viewers see the screen, not the back of a chair).
 Food: The “You can’t take food into the living room” rule does not go
over well with a viewing population trained to eat popcorn while they
watch the movies. So you need to consider how you will handle food.
You may want built-in trays or drink holders, or nothing. Maybe you
need tables between chairs instead. All we ask is that you think about
how you’ll handle food when you are buying the furniture and rugs. No
sense setting yourself up for yelling at the kids later.
You need to think about seating more than some other aspects of your home
theater because many people are used to viewing movies in bed, on couches,
on the floor, and so on. You really need to think through how you define com-
fortable and then design toward that.
Cuddlebags (www.cuddlebag.com, $250–$600) has some really neat theater
beanbag-style pillows — they’re comfortable, washable, and malleable, too.
They come as big as 8 feet wide. Wow, that’s a lot of cuddling!

Moving Up to the High End
In This Chapter
 Defining the high end
 Checking out integrated systems
 Doubling your lines
 Getting into scalers and interpolators
O
ne somewhat vaguely defined concept that we talk about throughout
Home Theater For Dummies is the idea that you can move up to the high
end when you’re buying components and setting up a home theater. Everyone
has his or her own definition of high end, but for us, it means equipment that
is designed to offer the ultimate reproduction of music and movies.
In this chapter, we quit talking about high end in the abstract and get real con-
crete by introducing you to some really awesome high-end systems. (Watch out
for nosebleeds here.) The systems’ designers are so single-minded in their pur-
suit of musical and video fidelity that they’ve created their own proprietary
systems that they feel do a better job than standard mix-and-match compo-
nents. When we say a system is proprietary, we mean that it is designed to work
best (or in some cases only) with other components from the same vendor. So
if you buy part of your home theater from one of these vendors, you’ll proba-
bly end up buying all of it from them — at least on the audio side. These sys-
tems usually work with any display. When you buy a proprietary system, you
are in effect taking a bet on this company’s ability to do things better than the
industry in general does — and on its ability to stay in business and support
you in the future.
Later in this chapter, we also talk about some of the video processing systems
that let your top-of-the-line display really look as good as (or better than) the
movies you see in the theater.

Introducing High-End Home Theater
In the introduction to this chapter, we start to define what we think high-end
theater is. Our definition of high end starts and ends with the philosophy of
the designers and engineers who create the product (which can be speakers,
a display, an A/V controller or power amplifier, or even an A/V receiver,
though high-end systems usually go with separates).
Anybody designing a piece of consumer electronics equipment has to bal-
ance a lot of different (and often conflicting) requirements: price, aesthetics,
size, performance, interoperability with other gear, and so on. High-end gear
skews this very delicate balance toward the performance side of the equa-
tion, and as a result, the high-end components can be much more expensive,
big, proprietary, and even ugly.
A few years back, there was a bit of a geographic divide (or at least, a per-
ceived divide) between high-end and mass-market A/V components. High-end
vendors were located in the United States, Canada, and Europe, while big
consumer electronics companies based in Asia were focused on high-volume,
middle-market products. We’re not convinced that this perception was ever
correct, but we’re sure that it’s not true today. Although many high-end man-
ufacturers are indeed based in the traditional places, you can find some
really awesome (and expensive) gear coming from those big Asian consumer
electronics companies. Just because a company sells a ton of $299 A/V
receivers doesn’t mean that it can’t build a great $3,000 receiver. So throw
any perceptions of brand bias out the door because you may be surprised by
who’s got some really fine high-end products these days.
Separating Your Amps
Within the audio realm of the home theater domain, the most common step
for manufacturers moving up to higher-quality products is to move from the
all-in-one A/V receiver into separates. We talk a little bit about separates in
Chapter 11, but in this chapter, we get a bit more detailed.
Basically, separate components take the many functions of an A/V receiver
and divide them among several separate components. Doing this has two
major benefits: greater flexibility and better performance.
A/V receivers are really pretty darned good these days, and there is such a
thing as a high-end A/V receiver. These receivers (from companies such as
Denon, Yamaha, and Marantz, to name just a few) compete performance-wise
with most separates systems in their price range.
316
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

The functions of an A/V receiver are usually doled out to the following 
components:
 A/V controller: This device handles all the surround sound decoding
and digital-to-analog conversions. It also switches audio and video (from
source devices to the amplifiers or display) and performs the preampli-
fier functions (from adjusting the power level of audio signals going to
the amplifiers, to adjust the listening volume). A few A/V controllers
include a built-in radio tuner, making them essentially A/V receivers
without built-in power amplifiers.
Depending on who’s talking, you might hear these devices referred to 
as surround sound processors, home theater preamps, or something else
entirely. If it decodes the surround sound signals and switches between
audio and video sources, it’s an A/V controller.
 Power amplifier: These devices boost the power of analog audio signals
coming out of the controller in order to drive the speakers and create
sound. As we just mentioned, you don’t control volume with the power
amplifier (the A/V controller does that). Basically, a power amplifier is a
big box with an on/off switch, speaker terminals, and one or more RCA
jack audio inputs on the back for connecting to the A/V controller. Most
home theater power amplifiers are multichannel amplifiers, meaning
they have five, seven, or more built-in amplifiers for powering all your
surround sound speakers. Some systems are designed around mono
power amplifiers, in which each channel in the system has its own ampli-
fier. (You can also find two- and three-channel amplifiers to mix and
match into a five- or more channel system.)
 Radio tuner: We discuss these in Chapter 5. Just remember that the
majority of A/V controllers don’t have a built-in tuner, so if you want to
listen to the radio, you need to buy a separate tuner. If you have digital
cable or a DSS satellite dish, you might get around this requirement if
you can receive radio stations through these systems (and if you like the
channel line-ups they offer).
Connecting a separates system is really only minimally different from the
process of hooking up a home theater that’s based on an A/V receiver. Just as
you do with an A/V receiver, you want to route all your source components
through the A/V controller. All your analog audio, digital audio, and video
connections connect directly from the source device to the A/V controller.
(The only exception to this rule is this: If you don’t have enough of the right
kind of video inputs on your A/V controller — specifically if your controller
doesn’t have component video switching — you might connect the video
cables from some of your components directly to the display.)
Your powered (active) subwoofer connects directly to the A/V controller, just
as it connects to your A/V receiver. The rest of your speakers, however, are
317
Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End

connected differently. You use an audio interconnect cable (the standard RCA
plug cables we discuss in Chapter 16) for each channel of your 5.1-, 6.1-, or
7.1-surround sound system and route this signal from a set of Power Amplifier
Out connections on the back of your controller to the appropriate Preamp In
connections on the back of your power amplifier(s).
Moving into Integrated Systems
One way that many high-end vendors create their high-performance systems
is to create their own integrated ways of doing home theater. Some of these
systems use proprietary connection systems (their own special cables) to
link components, whereas others use standard connectors and cables but
have components that are specially designed to work together.
These systems are basically the steroid-enhanced siblings of the inexpensive
home-theater-in-a-box systems we discuss in Chapter 2. You buy a complete
system from a single manufacturer, rather than picking and choosing between
components from different vendors. It’s a high-end, soup-to-nuts approach;
the power amplifiers, A/V controllers, DVD and CD players, and speakers —
everything but the display itself, in most cases — come as one integrated
package from one company.
In the sections that follow, we talk about some of the leading integrated sys-
tems. (Just keep in mind that these aren’t the only manufacturers who build
these kinds of systems, just a sampling.)
NHT Xd System
NHT (Now Hear This, www.nhthifi.com) has long been one of the preemi-
nent loudspeaker manufacturers in the United States (Pat’s pair of their tiny
little SubZero models have graced his home office for over ten years). They’ve
recently moved beyond the traditional loudspeaker and into a new integrated
high-end home theater system called the NHT Xd (www.nhtxd.com).
The NHT Xd is a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) based system that includes
special satellite speakers, bass units (essentially subwoofers), and the secret
sauce — the XdA amplifier/DSP unit.
Essentially, the Xd system is a “closed” environment that “knows” the exact
properties of the XdS satellite speakers and the XdW bass units connected to
the system and then uses the digital signal processing and digital amplification
built into the XdA unit to provide exceptional sound. With these characteris-
tics in mind, the XdA electronically modifies the sound coming out of your
318
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

source devices and tailors it to sound better (closer to the original sound)
when it comes out of the speakers. How it all works is rather complex (and
no doubt a trade secret for NHT).
This is a really neat trick that allows the relatively small Xd system to sound
like it should be taking up half of your room and be installed only by piano
movers.
You still need to add your own source devices and surround sound decoder
into the Xd system, but you won’t need any other amplification. You make
only three simple one-time settings: tell the Xd system how many bass units
you are using, tell how many satellites/where they are located, and set the
volume control for the bass. Otherwise, it’s just set it and forget it.
You can configure the Xd system in different ways, depending upon your
home theater requirements — NHT recommends a 6.2 system, with six satel-
lites and two bass units, but you can mix and match. The basic component
setup consists of two satellites, one bass unit, and one XdA DSP/amplifier
unit (which can support two satellites and up to two bass units) and retails
for about $6,000 (including stands for the satellites and all the wires and
cables you need to hook things up).
Meridian
Meridian (www.meridian-audio.com) offers some of the coolest, highest-
end A/V equipment available anywhere. One Meridian feature that we think
really reflects the future of A/V gear is the computer-like construction. Meridian
systems are incredibly modular and upgradeable. So if your current Meridian
processor, for example, doesn’t support a new surround sound format, you can
simply have your dealer pop in a new card.
Meridian’s products are known for being some of the finest in terms of deal-
ing with digital audio signals (no surprise given Meridian’s expertise in the
field), and Meridian does a couple of things differently than most other A/V
component vendors:
 Smart Link: Meridian has an all-digital connection called Smart Link for
carrying DVD-Audio signals to the controller. In Meridian’s own words
(and we believe what they’re saying), Smart Link allows “the full resolu-
tion of multichannel audio from DVD-A recordings [to] be losslessly
transferred in the digital domain from player to surround controller to
loudspeaker.” That’s a mouthful, but it means that digital audio signals
remain digital until the very final link in the audio chain — the speakers.
Meridian can do this because of Smart Link, and also because of the item
we discuss next.
319
Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End

 DSP loudspeakers: Meridian builds active loudspeaker systems designed
to connect and integrate with its lineup of CD/DVD players and A/V con-
trollers. Like all active speakers, these have built-in power amplifiers, so
you don’t need a separate amp. The difference comes with the DSP that
gives them their name. This digital signal processor allows Meridian to
send fully digital audio signals to the speakers. So the digital chain is
broken only when the speakers themselves convert this signal to analog
internally. You benefit from a clean, interference-resistant digital connec-
tion. Additionally, the DSP speakers do all the things that normal loud-
speakers do (such as crossovers that send different frequencies to different
drivers within the speaker) entirely in the digital domain. There’s even a
separate amplifier within the DSP speakers for each individual driver.
All this modularity, flexibility, and digital audio goodness doesn’t come cheap.
Meridian’s flagship speakers, the DSP8000, cost $40,000 a pair. They’re not for
the faint of heart or the shallow-walleted. But the sound is simply awesome.
We understand that most folks can’t afford (or won’t spend the money on)
$20,000-a-piece loudspeakers. (We can’t either, to be honest, at least not with-
out second mortgages and angry wives.) But we’re telling you about this
product because these kinds of systems give you a feel for what’s possible in
home theater. And the technologies featured in these systems will eventually,
in the words of Ronald Reagan, “trickle down” to more affordable gear. We
certainly can’t wait for DSP-based active loudspeakers and modular, upgrade-
able components to hit the Crutchfield catalog instead of the super-expensive
boutique audio stores.
Exploring High-End Video Systems
Audio isn’t the only part of home theater that fits into the high-end category.
If you’ve read earlier parts of the book (particularly the discussions of front-
projection display systems in Chapter 14), you already know that high-end
video systems (such as the $30,000 three-chip DLP projectors we keep men-
tioning) are out there on the market, waiting to be gobbled up by well-to-do
home theater enthusiasts. If you want to go high-end with front projection, look
for units from Faroudja (www.faroudja.com) or Runco (www.runco.com).
In this section, we talk about a group of high-end devices called video proces-
sors that complement these displays (particularly projection systems) in
many home theaters.
320
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

Improving resolution
If you go for a front- or rear-projection system or the biggest plasma display,
you get a really big picture in a home theater. The problem is, the picture is
so big that you begin to see the line structure of analog NTSC television
broadcasts (and other low-resolution sources, such as VHS VCR tapes).
These sources just don’t have sufficient resolution, and you end up in a situa-
tion in which a picture that looks okay on a 20-inch TV in the bedroom looks
like a disaster on your fancy projection TV. Simply put, the 250 horizontal
lines that make up a VHS picture will be so far apart on a big-screen display
that you can see them (and the black lines between them) without sticking
your face up next to the screen. To say the least, this is annoying.
To get around this, many high-end projectors (and other displays as well) use
a device known as a line doubler. A line doubler, in its simplest form, takes
the two fields that make up a frame in an interlaced video system and com-
bines them. (We discuss frames and fields in Chapter 4 if you’re not sure what
we’re talking about here.) These newly reconstructed frames are then sent to
the display twice in a row, until the next pair of images comes along (1⁄30 of a
second after the first). For example, with NTSC broadcast TV signals, the 480
interlaced scan lines of the broadcast come out of the line doubler (and head
into your display) as 480 progressive-scan lines. This makes for a much
smoother image and helps hide those visible scan lines because twice as
many are displayed at a time.
To take advantage of a line doubler, your display must be able to handle pro-
gressive-scan video. Look for displays with scan rates of 31.5 kHz or higher.
(We discuss scan rates in Chapter 13.) Most HDTV-ready or progressive scan
displays already have an internal line doubler built in. As you start moving
into really high-end home theater installations, many experts like to bypass
these by using a top-of-the-line external line doubler (or more likely, one of
the devices we discuss in the next section).
Investigating top-of-the-line 
video processors
Video processors go beyond simple line doubling. You can find processors
that quadruple the number of lines on your display, and increasingly you can
purchase a processor that scales a video source to a specific (and often
custom) fixed resolution suitable for displays like plasma, LCD, and DLP,
which have a specific number of pixels on-screen.
321
Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End

Going quad
Some video processors do more than just double the lines of resolution. For
example, line quadruplers (as the name implies) quadruple the number of
scan lines being sent to the display. These systems don’t wait for four fields
to come in and then repeat them four times (which is what you might think
they do, given how line doublers work). Instead, line quadruplers do some
math and interpolate what might come between a pair of lines. (Because
there’s no actual picture data for the new extra lines, the quadrupler uses
various mathematical models to guess what might be there.) For NTSC analog
video signals, a quadrupler gives an output of 960 progressive-scan lines. (In
other words, it doubles the 480i output to 480p, and then doubles that again
to 960p.)
If you are using a CRT display with a line quadrupler, you need a display that
can handle a scan rate four times as fast as the standard NTSC scan rate
(which is about 15.7 kHz). So your display needs to be able to handle a 
63 kHz scan rate.
Line quadruplers are pretty rare these days simply because most folks have
begun using digital displays (like DLP projectors or plasma flat panels),
which have fixed resolutions. If you want to enhance the video quality for
these types of displays, you use one of the scalers we are about to discuss.
Scaling the video heights
The most advanced video processors available (usually called image scalers)
can convert an incoming video signal to a customized resolution — a resolu-
tion that is most suitable for a particular projector or other display. In other
words, these particular video processors don’t do a simple doubling or qua-
drupling of a signal. For example, if you were using a 1080p DLP projection
system, the scaler would convert an incoming video signal to a resolution of
1920 x 1080 pixels, with progressive scan.
Instead of a scan rate or a number of lines of resolution, fixed-pixel displays
need a video signal that contains a certain number of horizontal and vertical
pixels. For example, if you have a DLP-based projection system using Texas
Instruments HD-2 chip (which has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels), you want
a scaler that can output a 1280 x 720 video signal.
All the fixed-pixel displays on the market have their own internal scalers that
can perform this image scaling. Many home theater enthusiasts (at least
those who are spending $10,000 or more on a display) bypass these internal
scalers and use an external image scaler that they feel does a better job of
interpolating and creating video signals.
Most image scalers also contain circuitry to perform 3:2 pulldown, the process
of removing artifacts found in video when a 24-frame-per-second video is 
322
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

converted to a 30-frame-per-second video. (We discuss this in detail in
Chapter 4.) This feature is also found in many DVD players and a number of
displays, but standalone image scalers often have superior systems for this
process.
The following models are a couple of the most popular image scalers:
 Silicon Optix OptiScale: Silicon Optix (www.siliconoptix.com) 
manufactures several well-respected scalers. A model that can fit into
the budgets of those slightly below “tycoon” status is the OptiScale. 
This model, which retails for $1,995, can accept DVI, VGA, component, 
S-Video, and composite video inputs and can scale standard-definition
video to high definition, as well as de-interlace 1080i high-definition video
into 1080p. A feature we especially like is on the output side: The OptiScale
offers a 1366 x 768 resolution output, which matches most high-definition
plasma displays’ resolutions.
 DVDO iScan VP30: DVDO (www.dvdo.com) is one of the original big
names in the imager scaler business, and its iScan VP30 is a neat unit that
can play several roles in a home theater. For $1,999, the unit combines a
high-quality scaler with an HDMI switch — accepting up to four HDMI
inputs from different video source components in your home theater (a
big deal because very few TVs have more than two HDMI inputs, and even
fewer receivers have any HDMI switching at all — so the VP30 can come in
useful if you’re trying to connect an HDMI set-top box, a DVD player, and a
PS3 all at the same time!). The VP30 can scale any input resolution up to
HDTV resolutions, including 1080p, and also offers a Precision AV LipSync
function that ensures that your digital audio and video always stay syn-
chronized (so you don’t end up thinking you’re watching a poorly dubbed
Kung Fu movie due to audio/video timing issues).
323
Chapter 21: Moving Up to the High End
Relating scaled images and HDTV
You may have noticed that some video proces-
sors can output video at resolutions that would
qualify as HDTV resolutions (720p or higher). So
the question may have entered your mind,
“What’s the relationship between scaled images
and HDTV?” Well, to begin with, a scaled image
(no matter how high the resolution and how
good the system that created it) is not high def-
inition. After a lower-resolution video signal is
run through a high-quality scaler, the signal can
look great — spectacular even. But no interpo-
lation system (which is what all scalers are, in
essence) can put missing information back into
a video signal. Scalers can come close, but they
can’t match the real thing.
Having said that, we hasten to add that scalers
make great companions to HDTVs and HDTV-
ready displays. For this reason, the majority of
HDTV displays on the market already have some
sort of built-in internal scaler, which upconverts
lower-resolution video sources to an HDTV res-
olution. External image scalers can often
improve upon these internal systems and make
everything you watch on your HDTV look better.

Using High-End Controls
One of the most common things folks add to a home theater is a high-end
control system for providing local and remote control of your audio and
video masterpiece. You can get a complete system that provides this control,
and such systems are most often focused on whole-home control.
Crestron
Crestron (www.crestron.com) is a well-known company in this space.
Crestron doesn’t make DVD players, A/V receivers, or projection displays,
but their products (along with those of a company called AMX, www.amx.com,
which offers a similar line-up of products) can be found in many high-end
home theaters. Crestron offers a whole lot more than the remote controls 
we mention in Chapter 15. In a nutshell, Crestron builds whole-home control
systems that use LCD touchpads to control just about any electrically oper-
ated device in a home. A Crestron system can raise and lower your drapes,
dim your lights, adjust your HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)
system, and control all the devices in your home theater. And this list is by
no means exhaustive. There’s really not much you can’t do with a complete
Crestron system.
Specifically for home theater, Crestron makes several models of home theater
control systems that incorporate wired or wireless touch pads and central-
ized controllers (not A/V controllers, despite the name). These pads and con-
trollers interface with the IR or RS-232 ports on your A/V gear. Crestron’s
computer-like devices have enough intelligence that you can easily program
them to perform complex macros (or sequences of control actions). So with
only a single tap of a virtual button, you can set into motion all the things you
might do manually when turning on your home theater’s systems and getting
ready to watch a movie.
Crestron sells literally hundreds of components designed to control a home
theater (and a home!), and we won’t even try to run through them all here.
This isn’t off-the-shelf, DIY-type stuff. You need to go through a Crestron dealer
(many high-end home theater installers also install Crestron) to have a system
designed for, and installed in, your home theater. All this automated goodness
doesn’t come cheap. The typical Crestron installation is over $50,000, and that
doesn’t count the home theater components themselves.
324
Part V: Letting Your Home Theater Be All It Can Be 

Control 4
A new competitor to Crestron, Control4 (www.control4.com) has made a
big splash in 2006 with a wide range of components that do a lot of the same
things that Crestron’s systems do but at a significantly lower price.
Control4 offers products that fill all sorts of roles in an automated home,
ranging from controllers that can dim your lights, lower the drapes, and
adjust your heating or air conditioning to touch pad systems that let you
send commands to your home theater gear. Control4 even offers audio distri-
bution systems that can store digital audio and send it wirelessly throughout
the home.
Control4 keeps the price down (and their gear is significantly cheaper than
Crestron’s) by leveraging standardized components and technologies (like
Ethernet and Wi-Fi wireless networking). So Control4 gear doesn’t contain a
bunch of custom-built electronics, but instead uses some of the same compo-
nents as PCs — stuff that is built in the tens or hundreds of millions for very
low prices.
Among the most interesting parts of the Control4 lineup (from a home the-
ater perspective) are the audio distribution systems. The Media Controller
($1,495) contains an 80GB hard drive for storing digital music, a CD player for
importing new music, and Ethernet and Wi-Fi outputs for distributing the
music around your home. You can mix this with the company’s $1,995 touch-
screen controller and use its big 10.5-inch LCD screen to control your music
or anything else in the home connected to one of Control4’s systems.

epending on where you put your home theater, you can envision adding
all sorts of extras to flesh out your home operation. But in our minds,
there are some things you just gotta have — well, stuff you might really want
to have if you’re going for the ultimate home theater. We list a lot of them
here so that you have a checklist next time you’re on-line or at that home 
theater store.
Wireless Headphones
Ever want to use the home theater when your spouse, significant other, or
roommate is asleep, working, or performing brain surgery in the other room?
Ever get told to “Turn it down!” in no uncertain terms? Well, maybe you need
that marriage/friendship-saving device, the wireless headphone.

You can find some really cool models of headphones out there. Some cancel
out ambient noise (so the kids can scream and smash things and you won’t
hear a thing), others use some special digital signal processing to re-create
5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound. Some fit in your ear canals, and
some totally cover your ear with a huge “can.” Whatever you like, you can
find it in the headphone world.
We love wireless headphones because they enable you to get more popcorn
or let the dog out without catching a long cord on something and wreaking
havoc. So wireless headsets, which use radio waves to connect to a base sta-
tion plugged into the home theater receiver (like a cordless phone uses radio
waves to connect to the phone base station plugged into a phone jack), are
the way to go for us.
For really serious listening (what the high-end audio types call critical listen-
ing), you might not want to use cordless headphones, which probably don’t
have quite the ultimate fidelity of corded models. But for more casual use, we
find that many cordless models sound great.
One of the cooler wireless headsets we’ve seen comes from Sennheiser
(www.sennheiserusa.com). The RS 130 wireless headphone, which has a
list price of $169.95 (and can be found for about $20 cheaper many places) is
a good entry point into the world of wireless headsets. It even includes a
switchable SRS surround sound function so you can simulate the surround
sound effects of your home theater’s speakers with just the two speakers
built into the phones. (See Chapter 12 for more about headphones and sur-
round sound.)
Dolby has a capability called Dolby Headphone (www.dolby.com/
dolbyheadphone) that can take up to five channels of audio from any
source, feed it to your normal two-channel headphones, and make it sound
like it’s coming from that many speakers in a real listening room. The differ-
ence relative to stereo headphones is amazing. Look for the Dolby
Headphone logo on your receiver.
Power Conditioner
Close your eyes and think about your electrical power lines. No, really.
Imagine a current flowing (or alternating) from Homer Simpson’s nuclear
power plant, over the high voltage lines of Springfield, across hill and dale,
and finally ending up in a transformer on a pole outside your home. Think
about all the other junk attached to that electrical power grid. Even within
your home, tons of different electrical devices are connected to your power
lines. All this stuff adds its own little bit of degradation to the nice, clean,
pretty, sine-wavy alternating current coming out of those turbogenerators at
the power plant. End result: power at your home theater’s outlets that may
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

be of an incorrect voltage or that may be full of electrical noise that keeps all
your A/V components from being their best.
At a bare minimum, you need (absolutely need) some surge protection in
your home theater. But even with surge protection, you still may have issues.
For example, if your voltage drops (not an uncommon occurrence), it may
actually lower the output of your amplifier. You can also run into ground
issues that can either cause hums in your audio or create annoying lines in
your video display. So you might want to consider investing in a power condi-
tioner that improves and stabilizes your AC power. For example, Monster
Cable has some really cool (and cool looking) Home Theater Power Centers
that provide surge protection, voltage stabilization, and noise filtering. The
more expensive ones even have a cool digital voltmeter readout on the front.
Check them out at www.monstercable.com/power.
Shake It Up, Baby! (With Transducers)
If you are like us (and we feel that you are if you’ve read most of this book),
then you like to get totally into what you’re watching. After all, a home the-
ater is supposed to help suspend disbelief.
With audio transducers from companies like Clark Synthesis (www.
clarksynthesis.com), you can get one giant, T. Rex–step closer to the ulti-
mate goal of suspending disbelief! You’ll see these called many things — bass
shakers, tactile transducers, or as one vendor calls them, butt kickers. They
add an element that goes well beyond the sensation of a subwoofer, one that
helps change your whole theater into a sensaround environment. (Remember
Earthquake in the theaters?) The units are screwed onto the bottom of your
furniture or into the frames of your floorboards. Transducers operate a bit
like a subwoofer — vibrating in time with low frequency sounds — but
instead of moving air (and therefore creating sounds), they actually transmit
vibrations into solid objects (like the floor) for bass that you can feel as well
as hear.
These transducers are friendlier to the rest of the house than cranking up mas-
sive subwoofers that can seem to shake the whole neighborhood. Because the
low end of the sound is effectively isolated to a more specific area, namely the
couch or chairs, transducers virtually eliminate any bleeding of this sound into
adjoining rooms or connected housing units.
Transducers are also great for houses that are built on concrete slabs. Unlike
wood subfloors, concrete slabs don’t conduct bass particularly well.
The sky is the limit with transducers. You can get low-budget ones (such 
as Aura Bass Shakers for under $100, www.aurasound.com) that do a 
fairly good job. If you want more power and precision, check out the Clark
Synthesis models, which can run from $100 to $300 depending on the model
(www.smarthome.com), or the Buttkicker from The Guitammer Company,
331
Chapter 22: Ten (or So) Accessories for Your Home Theater

Inc. (www.guitammer.com). The difference is astounding and noticeable.
One thing to note: Some products support frequencies up to 200 Hz, and
some go even higher (up to 800 Hz). We prefer keeping it low, say between 
5 Hz and 200 Hz; otherwise, you find there is a constant background rumble
that gets nauseating after a while. Keep the effect directed and precise —
you’ll like it better. To control the frequency sent to your transducer, con-
sider an equalizer like Audio Source EQ, which runs about $120.
Consider using more than one; try, say, three across the bottom of your
couch. The middle transducer would acquire its signal from the LFE/sub-
woofer out of the processor-receiver and the two side ones would derive
their signals from the left and right front channels, respectively. With this
setup, you can get a better sense of the action in three dimensions. If you are
watching U571, for instance, when a depth charge goes off to the right of the
submarine, you get a sensation from the right channel, and when the lower
part of the compression from the bomb and water splash enters into the
soundtrack, you feel the subchannel and right channel together.
If you mount transducers directly to your furniture, you can get rubberized
molded mounts for your chair or couch legs that isolate the noise and vibra-
tion to your furniture.
If you install more than one of these transducers, you probably would do well
to power each unit with its own amp. Read the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions closely. For some of the cheaper models, powering them with anything
over a 20-watt amplifier is probably not a good idea. Some of the fancier
models call for an amplifier of at least 100 watts. You can find transducers that
come bundled with an amplifier (active transducers); consider getting one of
these if you have questions. In any case, the amp should have its own volume
control so that you can tune the effect relative to the audio level. The hi-fi qual-
ity of the amp is not critical, so you can use relatively inexpensive amplifiers.
You can get shaker units that attach to the floorboards of your house and can
shake the whole room. There are pros and cons to this. On the pro side, you
don’t have to worry about being on a particular piece of furniture in order to
get the effect. On the other hand, you are shaking the foundation of your
house (never really a good thing), and the vibrations can bleed into other
areas of your house. So, before you experiment with your foundation, think
about which surrounding rooms will be affected.
Motion Simulators
If moving with a movie is really your thing, and you’ve got a fairly open
budget, then check out the Odyssee motion simulators from D-BOX (www.d-
box.com). Unlike bass shakers, which provide only vibration or “shaking” in
response to the audio track and are in reality merely transducers that vibrate
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

rather than move air, Odyssee is a sophisticated motion-simulation system
that lifts seating and occupants on an X-Y-Z axis (pitch, roll, and yaw) at up to
2Gs (think F-14 at full throttle) of acceleration.
Odyssee provides dramatic motion that is precisely synchronized with on-
screen action, which draws in viewers even more by allowing them to accu-
rately experience the accelerations, turns, and jumps that they could
previously only imagine. When a car rounds a corner in a 007 chase scene, turn
with it. If the Top Gun jet fighter suddenly moves into a climb, climb with it.
Just about everyone who’s tried this system loves it, but the price tag will set
you back. An entry-level system runs $15,000 and up.
Back in January of 2004, D-BOX launched a 2nd-generation motion simulator.
Sold with its own armchair, this new product uses a simpler, more affordable
technology without compromising the whole effect. The basic model sells for
around $5,000 per chair.
The experience is possible thanks to a D-BOX DVD with controller codes that
actually maps motion to movies. You can see a listing of supported movies at
www.d-box.com/en/codes/index.html. Movies not on this list don’t
have the controller codes and therefore cannot provide the motion simula-
tion experience.
Turn It Up! Turn It Down! 
Turn It Up Again! Argh!
Sometimes, you just want everything at a quiet but intelligible level (like
when everyone else is sleeping). To help you in this endeavor, many A/V
receivers (and some TVs) have a compression circuit built into the digital
signal processor that keeps the louds from being too loud and the quiets
from being too quiet (this is often called night mode).
If you’re using older equipment that doesn’t have this feature, you need a lev-
eler (also called a levelizer or a stabilizer). This device automatically adjusts
your volume to a reasonable level (even as the source material gets louder or
quieter). If the source volume increases, a leveler will attenuate the signal
down; if the source signal decreases, it will adjust the signal up.
To use a leveler, you generally adjust the volume to where you want it, and
the leveler keeps the volume at that level. An audio leveler connects between
any line-level stereo or mono audio source and an amplifier (with RCA
output/input jacks) or between your TV or VCR outputs and the inputs to
your stereo tuner. Levelers range in price from $70 to $300 (you can check
out various units at www.smarthome.com).
333
Chapter 22: Ten (or So) Accessories for Your Home Theater

No more having to constantly juggle that remote (at least not for changing
the volume). Keep in mind, however, that these devices are really not for seri-
ous movie watching, when you want to have all the loud parts loud and the
quiet parts quiet. They are instead intended for nighttime viewing, when you
just don’t want to wake up the whole family and still want to hear the quiet
parts.
Be sure to check the types of audio input/output jacks supported by the
system you buy. You don’t want to have digital audio connections every-
where in your system and then buy an audio leveler that takes it down to a
lower common denominator with analog connections.
Riding Your Bike on TV
We talk about the power of true immersion with a great home theater — that
ability to suck you right into the display so you think you’re truly there. For
years, the health industry has been trying to make exercise gear that can
combine the power of digital technologies with the raw metal exercise equip-
ment to create an experience that people would pay extra for — to lose those
extra pounds and stay in shape.
You’ve probably at some time seen high-end exercise gear at a workout
center that sported the ability to view your competition as you row, row, row
your rowing machine. Or, to be able to visually take in the countryside in a
virtual environment as you ride your exercise bike. But it’s never been quite
realistic enough to really be convincing.
A couple of firms have tried to take this to a higher level. The company that
owns the ProForm, Reebok, NordicTrack, Image, and HealthRider exercise
gear product lines added Internet networking to these product lines and
launched a Web presence at www.iFIT.com to coordinate your Internet-
based workouts. Any iFIT-enabled exercise device can be remotely controlled
via your in-home LAN or broadband Internet connection.
If you have a treadmill, for instance, there are three types of iFIT.com workouts:
 Basic workouts, which control the speed and incline of your treadmill.
 Music workouts, which stream the device controls for your treadmill
through your computer to your device, accompanied by your choice of
music or the voice of a virtual personal trainer to get you going and keep
you going.
 Scenic workouts, which create a virtual landscape by streaming photos
and video clips to your computer screen along with the music, the
trainer’s voice, and device control signals.
Pretty neat, huh?!
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Intel’s Digital Health Group thinks it has the ability to take this to a much
higher level, however. In early 2006, Intel demonstrated high-definition video
clocked to your pace, so you could truly roam the countryside. We watched
professional bike riders cruise through the Tour de France and the French
countryside, with the screen matching the pace of the device and truly pro-
viding an out-of-country experience. With high definition, you can almost
forget you are working out.
Anything still missing from the experience? Well, you can’t steer your bike
and go down different roads — that would be nice. And there needs to be a
fan attachment of sorts that really truly mimics the pleasure of cruising down
a big hill with the wind in your face. That’s the best part.
But it’s light years better than other Internet or media-enabled gear out there
and really opens up the idea of being able to experience the world from the
comfort of your home theater (and lose weight at the same time). By the time
you read this, some of Intel’s technologies will have hit the market through
its software partners.
Putting Your Face on the TV
For more than 40 years — since AT&T (then Bell Telephone) demonstrated the
first “Picture Phone” at the 1964 New York World’s Fair — the telecommunica-
tions industry has been trying to get people to video conference. Whether it’s
shyness from being seen on a screen to a discomfort with the quality of the pic-
ture, video conferencing has been limited to select business populations — the
mass consumer market has not caught on.
But recently, with the boom in Web cams and camcorders that connect to
PCs, not to mention newfangled cellphones that can stream video from an
onboard camera, people are finally coming around to sending live video of
themselves.
Adding video conferencing to your TV set so the kids can conference with
Grandma and Grandpa is easier than ever before. Companies like D-Link
(www.dlink.com) have launched products specifically designed for adding
video conferencing to your TV set. D-Link has its DVC-1000 i2eye VideoPhone
($200), which is designed to allow video conferencing without an intermedi-
ary computer. You just plug one cord of the DVC-1000 into a standard tele-
phone, plug another cord into a television via RCA composite connections,
connect the DVC-1000 to your broadband Internet connection using a stan-
dard Ethernet network cable, and you are ready to conduct real-time video
conferencing.
335
Chapter 22: Ten (or So) Accessories for Your Home Theater

You cannot use a telephone plugged into the i2eye VideoPhone to place regu-
lar phone calls because the phone would not be connected to a standard
phone line. Only VideoPhone calls over the Internet can be made with a tele-
phone connected to the DVC-1000.
The DVC-1000 can send and receive video at up to 30 frames per second. The
remote control that comes with the DVC-1000 allows you to easily answer an
incoming videophone call or initiate a new one. Or, you can use the attached
telephone to initiate calls if you are more comfortable with that interface.
The DVC-1000 has a port for an external microphone, too, if you’d rather talk
into a headset or a mic.
D-Link also has a DVC-1100 version ($225), which has wireless broadband
access instead of a wired Ethernet connection. It also sells the DVC-2000
($350), which includes a built-in, 5-inch, color LCD screen, in case you don’t
want to use the TV display as your screen.
Putting Fish in Your TV
What do you do with that HDTV when you’re not watching TV? How about
putting an aquarium on the screen? Roku Labs (www.rokulabs.com) is 
one of our favorite vendors, and if you don’t have Roku somewhere in your
house, well, you’re just not enjoying your home theater for all it’s worth.
Roku’s PhotoBridge HD Digital Media Player ($400) is simply stunning. You
pop in your digital camera’s memory card or browse the files stored on your
computer via your home network (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), and voilà, your images
are displayed in pixel-perfect detail on your HDTV. You can also play digital
video and digital music from the media player as well. All navigation is via an
on-screen interface and Roku’s remote control.
But what really rocks us is Roku’s PhotoBridge HD Gallery Collection, which
turns your HDTV into a brilliant work of art. You can choose from a lot of dif-
ferent image collections to create that particular atmosphere to which you
aspire. Picasso, Monet, Leonardo da Vinci, Gauguin, Renoir . . . your pick. Or
maybe outer space images of far-off galaxies are what you like. Or mountains.
Or a poppy field. Danny loves his Aquarium Art Pack, which displays a lifelike
saltwater aquarium right in his living room. Watch tranquil fish swim across
your big screen while the water plants sway back and forth. Now that’s how
we want to see a puffer fish!
Roku has other awesome, award-winning product designs, like its SoundBridge
music streaming devices or SoundBridge Radio. You should check them out —
we talk a bit more about them in Chapter 10.

Improving Your Game 
Console Connection
If you read Chapter 16, you had a chance to check out our discussion of inter-
connect cables — the short run cables that hook A/V components together.
Hopefully, we convinced you of the importance of the hierarchy of these
cables and of using the best cable you can in all situations. (In the video
world, component is best, S-video is a close second, composite video lags
way behind, and RF coax connections are back on the bench trying to get the
coach to let them in the game.)
When it comes to game consoles, however, we do find that many people just
use whatever cable came in the box. As Jeremy Piven says in that movie mas-
terpiece PCU, “Don’t be that guy.” (If you missed PCU, the whole line is:
“You’re wearing the shirt of the band you’re going to see? Don’t be that guy.”)
If you stick with the simple, composite video cable that comes in the box
with the console, you strangle the gorgeous (and possibly high-def) picture
your system is capable of putting out. Use an S-Video cable or, if your TV can
handle it, a set of component video cables. (We recommend going with the
component video cables for your gaming console, simply because this gives
you the capability to play progressive scan and even HDTV-quality games on
your TV. And let your games give your eyeballs a treat.)
Turning Down the Lights Automatically
An excellent way to improve your picture is to minimize the light that comes
from anywhere but your video screen — in other words, to minimize the
ambient lighting by turning off light bulbs and closing drapes. You could get
up to turn off the lights and pull down the shades. A little exercise (and that
really is a little!) never hurts anyone. But how cool would it be to press a
button — a single button — and have the lights dim, the motorized drapes
lower, and the A/V system power up? Pretty cool, we think.
Sound kinda like The Jetsons? It’s really not. Home automation isn’t rocket sci-
ence. For just a few hundred dollars, you can put together a simple X-10 system
that dims the lights (theater-style, even) and activates the drape motors. You
can find lots of packages at www.smarthome.com. Automation systems are
337
Chapter 22: Ten (or So) Accessories for Your Home Theater

also a task that a good dealer can help out with. The superstore isn’t going to
do this for you, but if you find a good home theater dealer/installer, chances
are good that automation packages are part of what the folks there do.
This is too big a topic to cover in one section of one chapter. Home automa-
tion is a really cool addition to your whole home. We like this stuff so much,
we wrote a book about it (Smart Homes For Dummies, Wiley), and you can
find out how all this automation stuff works there.
Stick This on Your DVD!
If you have a personal video recorder in your home theater — or you have a lot
of MP3s, digital photos, or home videos — chances are you’re going to burn
these to CD or DVD at some point — possibly for Mom and Dad for their birth-
days. That’s great — burning CDs and DVDs is something that’s easy to do.
But after you’ve crafted a movie from all your camcorder footage and
painstakingly matched it to your favorite musical score — and managed to
get it onto a DVD for playing on any DVD player on the planet — there’s
something sinful about taking a black marker and scribbling on the disc.
Well, lucky for you, a few companies have put together very easy-to-use label-
ing kits that help you design and print self-adhesive labels that stick to your
DVDs and CDs. (So next time you’re in a bar, you can tell that good-looking
person next to you, “I own my own CD label.”)
Check out products from Fellowes and Avery — both are good and come with
software to help you create the label images. The kits also contain paper that
you stick in your laser or inkjet printer, and out come beautiful color labels
worthy of an award. Figure on spending $15–$30 for a kit that comes with
about 100 sheets of label sticker blanks. You can also buy spine labels and
blank plastic packaging for a truly impressive custom DVD package.
For a few more bucks, you can consider upgrading to a printer that can print
directly onto the discs themselves. Epson (www.epson.com), Canon (www.
canon.com), and others make inkjet printers that let you feed “printable”
DVDs and CDs (like TDK’s PrintOn blank discs) right into the printer itself. We
think that this is the best-looking labeling system for the discs themselves —
though you may still want some of the other labeling products described ear-
lier for your CD/DVD storage cases, booklets, and the like.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Coming soon to a set-top box near you may be the ability to burn a disc and
print a silkscreen-quality label on the disc, all inside the set-top box. That’s
right, set-top boxes from your cable, satellite, and telephone providers soon
will be outfitted with the ability to not only burn a movie or other content to
a DVD, but also to print that movie’s label by using HP’s LightScribe technol-
ogy (already available on some PCs). So not only can you order a movie on
demand whenever you want, but you could also buy the movie, burn it to a
DVD, and then print the label on the disc — without having to go to any old
video store. Now that’s useful — and legal, because when you “buy” the
movie, you are actually buying the rights to create your own DVD copy of 
the movie.
Disc-O!
Although they’re not as sexy as fish on your TV or tush-rattling transducers,
there are some disc accessories that you simply must have in your high-def
cabinet.
First and foremost are disc cleaning and repair kits. You can find these for $10
at Radio Shack, Crutchfield.com, or just about any electronics store. These
kits include a disc-spinning device and a solution to polish the plastic CD/DVD
to get rid of scratches (we hate those), smudges, and other generally unwel-
comed surface anomalies on your discs. Just pop your disc into the unit, give
it a spin, and voilà! — clean disc. SmartHome.com sells a really nice battery-
powered unit for around $40.
There are disc cleaning kits and disc repair kits — cleaning kits do not neces-
sarily repair scratches. Be sure you get a cleaning and repair kit in one.
You may also want to get a lens cleaner kit, which will clean your DVD/CD
player’s laser eye to make sure your discs are read as clearly as possible.
Again, this is as easy as sticking the cleaning disc into your DVD or CD player
and “playing” the disc. These also are inexpensive — around $15.
An optical head should not need cleaning very often, unless your room is
really dusty. (In which case, you should get an air filter!) Often, merely blow-
ing your lens area with canned compressed air is the easiest and safest way
to deal with such problems. You can get compressed air at any office or com-
puter supply store. However, many people like the simplicity of using a lens
cleaner kit, which is fine, too.
339
Chapter 22: Ten (or So) Accessories for Your Home Theater

Do not attempt to use a lens cleaner kit designed for CD/DVD players on your
notebook or laptop computer DVD drives. The locked spindle in most com-
puter drives would cause the brush to push against the optical head with too
much force. That could knock the head off its alignment track, damaging the
drive permanently.
Finally, believe it or not, there are special cleaning solutions for your expen-
sive displays too. The problem with using regular window cleaning spray is
that it will run down the screen and get into your display — that’s not good
because these displays don’t like moisture. And even if you are smart enough
to spray the rag and not the display before swiping, regular window spray
can streak (very annoying) and regular paper towels and rags can also
scratch your screen.
Some displays have special anti-reflective coatings that can be damaged by
cleaners that contain ammonia, alcohol, or some other substances. Read the
manual for your display before you try cleaning it!
So leave it to the folks at high-end accessories maker Monster Cable (www.
monstercable.com) to come up with the Monster ScreenClean product
($20). There’s no dripping — Monster ScreenClean’s drip-free cleaning solu-
tion stays where you spray it until you wipe it off. It cleans without leaving
annoying streaks, and the kit sports a scratch-free microfiber cloth that pol-
ishes screens with crystal clarity and color. You can use this for your camera
lenses and other glass-outfitted gear, too.
So spend the few extra dollars to really take care of all the expensive gear.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the home theaterphile’s library
 Getting Electronic House on paper
 Finding on-line help with your home theater purchases
W
e can in no way cover the entire home theater industry in one book.
So we’re leaving a few nuggets for other publications to cover. It’s 
only fair.
Here’s a listing of the publications that we read regularly (and therefore rec-
ommend unabashedly) and that you should get your hands on as part of your
home theater project. Most publications allow you to purchase back issues of
their magazines, so you can have a library at your fingertips in about a week.
You know what they say: You can never be too rich or read too much about
home theater before you become too poor.
Because this is the 21st century, we include some “virtual” items in our home
theater library — Web sites, in other words. Keep in mind that the Web sites
we mention here have just a ton of information on-line, but you might have to
try different search keywords to find exactly what you’re looking for. Topics
vary substantially from site to site. All sites are free unless otherwise noted.
Home Theater Magazine
Phone: 800-264-9872 or 850-682-7644
Web site: www.hometheatermag.com
Home Theater Magazine is one of the main sources for information about
home theater. It is a very high-end publication and will certainly expose you
to a range of systems, from budget items to those on the finer side of home

theater. Don’t be surprised when you see $30,000 projectors reviewed, for
instance. Don’t let that scare you, however, because every issue has some-
thing to offer, no matter what budget constraints you’re dealing with. And
you can always find out about the leading trends in the industry, which is
important because there’s nothing like buying yesterday’s technology on sale
and thinking you got a great deal. (How about that sale on Betamax VCRs,
huh?) The accompanying Web site offers archives of prior articles. An annual
subscription costs $12.97 for 12 issues — quite a deal.
The same folks also publish a dynamite Home Theater Buyer’s Guide Annual
Directory, which lists more than 5,000 source devices, controllers, speakers,
home-theater-in-a-box packages, video displays, and all sorts of accessories.
The buyer’s guide is broken into three sections — audio component prod-
ucts, video component products, and speaker products — for $3.95 a section
or all three for $9.95. They are delivered in .pdf form to your e-mail.
Ultimate AV
Web site: www.guidetohometheater.com
Ultimate AV focuses on the high-end sector of the home theater market. It
used to be a nice glossy magazine called Stereophile Guide to Home Theater,
but is now a fully Web-based publication called Ultimate AV. The guide’s cadre
of industry experts is dedicated to providing in-depth gear reviews on every-
thing from projectors to line conditioners to DVD players to HD tuners.
Instructional how-to columns on fine-tuning your system, special features,
and software reviews help you get the most out of your system. But it’s the
reviews we crave here.
Stereophile
Phone: 800-666-3746 or 850-682-7644
Web site: www.stereophile.com
Stereophile is devoted to the high end of the market, concentrating on the
better audio equipment and recordings available. Again, that does not mean
there is nothing for the budget-minded — it’s found in the feature stories and
advice columns on topics like placement of speakers for maximum effect. If
you are going to buy some new audio gear, check out the reviews here. You
can also check out the AV Marketplace for what’s for sale — you tend to find
dealers dumping demo models here for fairly decent prices. An annual sub-
scription runs $12.97.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sound & Vision
Phone: 800-876-9011 or 212-767-6000
Web site: www.soundandvisionmag.com
Another respected home theater publication that captures the essence of
home theater and its various components is Sound & Vision. This publication
regularly has helpful articles in layman’s non-techie language about how to set
up your speakers, tune your system, and so on. The buyer’s guides are ample
and feature checklists. All in all, this is a very friendly publication for the
beginner, with meat for the more advanced home theater enthusiast as well.

Top on-line HDTV buying guide centers
Many sites are getting into the HDTV game by
offering on-line areas devoted just to getting an
HDTV. While certainly not as complete or as
friendly as our HDTV For Dummies book (Wiley),
they do help you find info fast if on-line
researching is for you. Here’s a sampling of sites
focused on HDTV articles, reviews, and buying
tips all in one place:

best coverage in terms of reviews, in a “turn 
the table on the reviewer’s” approach,
Consumersearch.com reviews the most recent
HDTV articles and reviews of HDTVs at
www.consumersearch.com/www/
electronics/hdtv/reviews.html.
What a neat idea!

The accompanying Web site contains archived issue content, and its S&V
Forums are a great place to ask questions. The editors moderate the forums,
which are heavily trafficked. You can even listen to Sound & Vision Radio
streamed via RadioAmerica.org.
A one-year subscription to the printed publication costs $10.
Electronic House
Phone: 800-375-8015 or 508-663-1500
Web site: www.electronichouse.com
Electronic House is one of our favorite publications because you can read a
lot of very easy-to-understand articles about all aspects of an electronic
home, including the home theater domain. It is written for the consumer who
enjoys technology.
Although only a portion of each issue deals with home theater topics,
Electronic House provides a coverage of the key issues of the systems a home
theater comprises, including audio, video, remote controls, speakers, wiring,
lighting, and other home theater components. Each issue also devotes time
to neat new things on the market — most within the budget of any family —
such as new remote controls, cool new consumer devices, and accessories
for your entertainment system. Electronic House also offers an Electronic
House Planning Guide, which walks you through all sorts of issues you’re
likely to encounter when upgrading your home for the 21st century.
We think that, after you start reading this magazine, you’ll want to expand
your interests beyond home theater to the whole home at large. (Then you’ll
want to buy our Smart Homes For Dummies book, too!) A one-year subscrip-
tion to Electronic House is $19.95.
Crutchfield
Phone: 800-955-9009 or 434-817-1000
Web site: www.crutchfield.com
This is the perennial catalog that sits by the toilet for constant perusing while
in the, er, office. Crutchfield offers a free catalog of all sorts of A/V and home
theater gear, and it’s great for just getting ideas about what’s out there. Its
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

companion Web site is laid out very simply and offers a Home Theater and
A/V Info Center. For instance, you can find some great photos of the various
connectors at www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/learningcenter/home/
connections_gallery.html. (This URL might change, so look around for
their Home A/V Connections Photo Gallery if you can’t find it.) Overall, we
pick up our Crutchfield when we want to know, “Does anybody have some-
thing that will. . . .”
CNET.com
Web site: www.cnet.com
CNET.com is a simple-to-use, free Web site where you can do apples-to-apples
comparisons of home theater and electronic equipment. You can count on
seeing pictures of what you are buying, videos of an editor playing with it,
editor ratings of the equipment, user ratings of the gear, reviews of most
devices, and a listing of the places on the Web where you can buy it all —
with the actual pricing along with it. It’s a one-stop resource for evaluating
your future home electronics purchases. What we especially like is the ability
to compare, side-by-side, different devices, so we can see who has which fea-
tures. Overall, a solid stop on your Web research trip.
Home Theater Forum
Web site: www.hometheaterforum.com
Home Theater Forum is a massive Internet messaging site where people inter-
ested in home theater gather to discuss their issues and solutions. You can
find areas for discussion of home theater basics, construction, DIY solutions,
sources, displays, and so on. You really should check it out, if for no other
reason than to see that lots of other people just like you are also trying to
figure out what’s going on in home theater.
The HT Construction, Interiors, and Automation forum is a great place to find
out issues other DIYers have had with putting in their home theaters, and tips
and tricks for avoiding problems. When we last checked, there was a great
thread about how to find old theater seats that you could renovate and put in
your home theater. Fun!
345
Chapter 23: Ten Great Sources for More Information

Home Theater Talk
Web site: www.hometheatertalk.com
Home Theater Talk is another great site. This site is run by none other than
the technical editor for the first edition of this book, Mike Knapp, who was an
admin on the Home Theater Forum for several years before striking out on
his own. Home Theater Talk isn’t as big as Home Theater Forum, but it has a
nice, friendly atmosphere — it’s the “neighborhood pub” of on-line home the-
ater sites. There are lots of handy DIY features posted by readers and others;
one person had just bought a set of Aura Bass Shaker tactile transducers and
showed how to put them in and his results — “I am somewhat pleased with
the results. Allow me to qualify that. I WILL NOT use these for music EVER!
But in all honesty, they aren’t designed for music anyway.”
AV Science
Web site: www.avsforum.com
Similar to Home Theater Forum, AV Science’s AVSForum.com is an on-line
community of technical enthusiasts who indeed wallow in the minutest
details of a home theater installation. But think of it this way: It’s a collection
of the-guy-next-door-who-knows-how-to-install-A/V-gear’s pearls of wisdom —
a proverbial hothouse of information and opinions that you can tap into to
help solve your problems.
The site is organized in folders according to interests. If you want information
on how to fine-tune your TiVo, there’s a whole group devoted to that, for
instance. There are also places where people are selling their old gear. As the
techies buy the latest gear, they sell off their leading-edge stuff from a few
years back — at great prices. The manufacturers themselves monitor this site
for feedback from customers about what they want in their next versions. It
has that much to offer.
If you’re considering buying a specific piece of gear for your home theater,
check the appropriate forum folder and see if there’s an owner’s thread. We
find that these discussions (where folks who actually have that equipment
discuss their experiences and issues they’ve encountered) are the best part
of AVS Forum. For example, when Pat was considering buying his Vizio
P50HDM plasma, he spent a ton of time on this forum and was able to find
out about some issues with the initial versions of this TV and was also able to
figure out that the unit he was buying had already had the “fix” performed as
a running change on the factory assembly line.
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

eBay
Web site: www.ebay.com
Although eBay started out as a place where people could sell everything in
their attics, it has really matured into a place where all sorts of equipment is
bought and sold. Companies sell excess gear here. Old home theater gear is
available in the listings. Even new stuff is being sold on-line. You never know
what you are going to find here, and it is a “let the buyer beware” type of
environment. You, indeed, get what you pay for. Nonetheless, you can get a
good handle for street prices for used gear here, and we’ve known people
who have grown their home theater by trading up equipment through eBay,
spending a fraction of what they would have if they had bought new compo-
nents in the stores.
Other Sources
Almost any major retail store chain where you might purchase home theater
equipment has a Web site. These sites often contain information centers about
home theater and are a good stop before going to meet the geeks at the store.
For instance, Circuit City has a starter section on the basics of home theater.
Sears has its Buying Guides.
In addition to these information boutiques, here are some other sites for you
to sample:
