About the Author
Matthias Marschall is a software engineer "Made in Germany" and the author of the Chef 
Infrastructure Automation Cookbook by Packt Publishing. His four children make sure that he 
feels comfortable and stays in control of chaotic situations. A lean and Agile engineering lead, 
he's passionate about continuous delivery, infrastructure automation, and all things DevOps.
In recent years, Matthias has helped build several web-based businesses, first with Java 
and then with Ruby on Rails. He quickly moved into system administration, writing his own 
configuration management tool before moving his whole infrastructure to Chef in its early days.
In 2008, he started a blog (http://www.agileweboperations.com) with Dan Ackerson. 
There, they shared their ideas about DevOps since the early days of the continually emerging 
movement. You can fid him on Twitter at @mmarschall.
Matthias is the CTO of www.gutefrage.net GmbH that helps run Germany's biggest Q&A 
site among other high traffic sites. He holds a master's degree in computer science [Dipl.-Inf. 
(FH)] and teaches courses on Agile software development at the University of Augsburg.
When not writing or coding, Matthias enjoys drawing cartoons and playing Go. He lives near 
Munich, Germany.
Thanks go to my colleagues at gutefrage.net for all those valuable 
discussions.
I would also like to thank Adam Jacob, Joshua Timberman, and all the  
other great people at Chef, Inc. for your help with this book.
Special thanks go to my reviewers, Earl Waud, Greg Swallow, Max Manders, 
and Robert Curth, who made this book so much better.

About the Reviewers
Robert Curth is an engineer at gutefrage gruppe. In his current project, HELPSTER, Chef is 
used to automate the server setup. When Robert is not programming, he organizes company 
events and talks about how to live a good life on his blog at http://rocu.de.
I want to thank all the amazing authors of Chef cookbooks and tools. Chef 
has come a long way since the first edition of this book!
Thanks, Matthias, for updating this book. I love how elegant many of these 
recipes are. I hope you, dear reader, enjoy them as much as I did!
Kristian Hoffmann is the sort of twisted individual who likes hacking code (in Perl, if 
possible) and cars (the smaller and faster, the better) and solving problems that would lead 
other people to throw their hands up in despair. After some early experimentation with Linux 
(circa Slackware 3.0), his tech career started as a lowly tech at a local ISP. He went on to 
complete his bachelor's in computer science, marry a fellow technophile, and rise to the 
ranks of the president/CTO in his adolescent ISP hacking grounds. He now enjoys the most 
significant challenge of raising two hopelessly tech-bound children.

Preface
Irrespective of whether you're a systems administrator or developer, if you're sick and tired 
of repetitive manual work and don't know whether you may dare to reboot your server, 
it's time for you to get your infrastructure automated.
This book has all the required recipes to configure, deploy, and scale your servers 
and applications, irrespective of whether you manage five servers, 5,000 servers, 
or 500,000 servers.
It is a collection of easy-to-follow, step-by-step recipes showing you how to solve 
real-world automation challenges. Learn techniques from the pros and make sure 
you get your infrastructure automation project right the first time.
This book takes you on a journey through the many facets of Chef. It teaches you simple 
techniques as well as full-fledged real-world solutions. By looking at easily digestible examples, 
you'll be able to grasp the main concepts of Chef, which you'll need to automate your own 
infrastructure. Instead of wasting time trying to get the existing community cookbooks running 
in your environment, you'll get ready-made code examples to get you started.
After describing how to use the basic Chef tools, the book shows you how to troubleshoot 
your work and explains the Chef language. Then, it shows you how to manage users, 
applications, and your whole Cloud infrastructure. The book concludes by providing you 
with additional, indispensable tools, and giving you an in-depth look into the Chef ecosystem.
Learn the techniques of the pros by walking through a host of step-by-step guides to solve 
your real-world infrastructure automation challenges.

Chapter 2, Evaluating and Troubleshooting Cookbooks and Chef Runs, is all about getting 
your cookbooks right. It covers logging and debugging as well as the why run mode, and 
shows you how to develop your cookbooks totally test driven.
Chapter 3, Chef Language and Style, covers additional Chef concepts, such as attributes, 
templates, libraries, and even Light Weight Resource Providers. It shows you how to use 
plain old Ruby inside your recipes and ends with writing your own Ohai and knife plugins.
Chapter 4, Writing Better Cookbooks, shows you how to make your cookbooks more flexible. 
It covers ways to override attributes, use data bags and search, and to make your cookbooks 
idempotent. Writing cross-platform cookbooks is covered as well.
Chapter 5, Working with Files and Packages, covers powerful techniques to manage 
configuration files, and install and manage software packages. It shows you how to install 
software from source and how to manage whole directory trees.
Chapter 6, Users and Applications, shows you how to manage user accounts, securing 
SSH and configuring sudo. Then, it walks you through installing complete applications, 
such as nginx, MySQL, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, and Varnish. It ends by showing you 
how to manage your own OS X workstation with Chef.
Chapter 7, Servers and Cloud Infrastructure, deals with networking and applications spanning 
multiple servers. You'll learn how to create your whole infrastructure using Chef provisioning. 
Then it shows you how to set up high-availability services and load-balancers, and how to 
monitor your whole infrastructure with Nagios. Finally, it'll show you how to manage your 
Amazon EC2 Cloud with Chef.
What you need for this book
To run the examples in this book, you'll need a computer running OS X or Ubuntu Linux 14.04. 
The examples will use Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/) as the editor. Make 
sure you configured Sublime text command-line tool subl to follow along smoothly.
It helps if you have Ruby 2.1.0 with bundler (http://bundler.io/) installed on your system 
as well.
Who this book is for
This book is for system engineers and administrators who have a fundamental understanding 
of information management systems and infrastructure. It helps if you've already played 
around with Chef; however, this book covers all the important topics you will need to know. 
If you don't want to dig through a whole book before you can get started, this book is for you, 
as it features a set of independent recipes you can try out immediately.

Chef Infrastructure

Introduction
This chapter will cover the basics of Chef, including common terminology, workflow practices, 
and various tools that work in accordance with Chef. We will explore version control using Git, 
walk through working with community cookbooks, and running those cookbooks on your own 
servers, so that you can configure them in the way you need them.
First, let's talk about some important terms used in the Chef universe.
A cookbook is a collection of all the components needed to change something on a server, 
such as installing MySQL, the most important one being recipes, which tell Chef which 
resources you want to configure on your host.
You need to deploy cookbooks to the nodes that you want to change. Chef offers multiple 
ways for this task. Most probably, you'll use a central Chef server. You can either run your 
own server or sign up for hosted Chef.
The Chef server is the central registry, where each node needs to be registered. The Chef 
server distributes the cookbooks you uploaded to it, to your nodes.
Knife is Chef's command-line tool to interact with the Chef server. You run it on your local 
workstation and use it to upload cookbooks and manage other aspects of Chef.
On your nodes, you need to install Chef client—the part that retrieves the cookbooks 
from the Chef server and executes them on the node.
In this chapter, we'll see the basic infrastructure components of your Chef setup at work and 
learn how to use the basic tools. Let's get started by taking a look at how to use Git as 
a version control system for your cookbooks.
Using version control
Do you manually back up every file before you change it? And do you invent creative file name 
extensions such as _me and _you when you try to collaborate a file? If you answer yes to any 
of these, it's time to rethink your processes.
A version control system (VCS) helps you stay sane when dealing with important files and 
collaborating with them.
Using version control is a fundamental part of any infrastructure automation. There are 
multiple solutions (some free, some paid) to manage source version control, including Git, 
SVN, Mercurial, and Perforce. Due to its popularity among the Chef community, we will be 
using Git. However, you could easily use any other version control system with Chef.

Don't even think about building your infrastructure as code without 
using a version control system to manage it!
Getting ready
You'll need Git installed on your local workstation. Either use your operating system's package 
manager (such as Apt on Ubuntu or Homebrew on OS X), or simply download the installer from 
www.git-scm.org.
Git is a distributed version control system. This means that you don't necessarily need a central 
host to store your repositories. However, in practice, using GitHub as your central repository has 
proven to be very helpful. In this book, I'll assume that you're using GitHub. Therefore, you need 
to go to www.github.com and create an (free) account to follow the instructions given in this 
book. Make sure that you upload your Secure Shell (SSH) key by following the instructions at 
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys, so that you're able to 
use the SSH protocol to interact with your GitHub account.
As soon as you have created your GitHub account, you should create your repository by 
visiting https://github.com while you're still logged in and using chef-repo as 
the repository name.
Make sure you have wget installed on your local workstation, in order to be able to download 
the required files from public servers.
How to do it...
Before you can write any cookbooks, you need to set up your initial Git repository on your 
development box. Chef Software, Inc. provides an empty Chef repository to get you started. 
Let's see how you can set up your own Chef repository with Git, using Chef's skeleton.
1.	 Download Chef's skeleton repository as a tarball:
mma@laptop $ wget http://github.com/chef/chef-repo/tarball/master
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
2014-11-30 22:00:43 (1.30 MB/s) - 'master' saved [9309/9309]
2.	 Extract the downloaded tarball:
mma@laptop $ tar xzvf master
3.	 Rename the directory:
mma@laptop:~ $ mv opscode-chef-repo-* chef-repo
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

4.	 Change to your newly created Chef repository:
mma@laptop:~ $ cd chef-repo/
5.	 Initialize a fresh Git repository:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/.
git/
6.	 Connect your local repository to your remote repository on github.com. Make sure to 
replace mmarschall with your own GitHub username:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git remote add origin git@github.
com:mmarschall/chef-repo.git
7.	
Configure Git with your user name and e-mail address:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git config --global user.email "you@
example.com"
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
8.	 Add and commit Chef's default directory structure:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git add .
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git commit -m "initial commit"
[master (root-commit) 6148b20] initial commit
 11 files changed, 545 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
create mode 100644 roles/README.md
9.	 Push your initialized repository to GitHub. This makes it available to all your co-
workers to collaborate on:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git push -u origin master
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
To git@github.com:mmarschall/chef-repo.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
How it works...
You have downloaded a tarball containing Chef's skeleton repository. Then, you initialized 
chef-repo and connected it to your own repository on GitHub.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 1
5
After that, you added all the files from the tarball to your repository and committed them. 
This makes Git track your files and the changes you make later.
Finally, you pushed your repository to GitHub, so that your co-workers can use your code too.
There's more...
Let's assume you're working on the same chef-repo repository, together with your co-
workers. They cloned your repository, added a new cookbook called other_cookbook, 
committed their changes locally, and pushed their changes back to GitHub. Now, it's time 
for you to get the new cookbook downloaded on to your own laptop.
Pull your co-workers' changes from GitHub. This will merge their changes into your local copy 
of the repository. Use the pull subcommand:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git pull --rebase
From github.com:mmarschall/chef-repo
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
create mode 100644 cookbooks/other_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
In case of any conflicting changes, Git will help you merge and resolve them.

Installing the Chef development kit on your 
workstation
If you want to use Chef, you'll need to install the Chef development kit (DK) on your local 
workstation first. You'll have to develop your configurations locally and use Chef to distribute 
them to your Chef server.

Chef provides a fully packaged version, which does not have any external prerequisites. This 
fully packaged Chef is called the omnibus installer. We'll see how to use it in this section.
How to do it...
Let's see how to install the Chef DK on your local workstation using Chef's omnibus installer:
1.	 Download the Chef DK for your specific workstation platform from https://
downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/ and run the installer.
2.	 Verify that Chef installed all the required components:
mma@laptop:~ $ chef verify
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Verification of component 'rubocop' succeeded.
Verification of component 'kitchen-vagrant' succeeded.
Verification of component 'chefspec' succeeded.
Verification of component 'berkshelf' succeeded.
Verification of component 'fauxhai' succeeded.
Verification of component 'test-kitchen' succeeded.
Verification of component 'package installation' succeeded.
Verification of component 'chef-dk' succeeded.
Verification of component 'knife-spork' succeeded.
Verification of component 'chef-client' succeeded.
3.	 Add the newly installed Ruby to your path:
mma@laptop:~ $ echo 'export PATH="/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin:$PATH"' 
>> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
You may not want to use (and don't have to use) ChefDK's Ruby, especially 
if you are a Rails Developer.
If you're happily using your Ruby rvm, or rbenv environment, you can 
continue to do so. Just ensure that the ChefDK-provided applications 
appear first in your PATH, before any gem-installed versions, and you're 
good to go.
How it works...
The omnibus installer will download Ruby and all required Ruby gems into /opt/chefdk.

Using the hosted Chef platform
If you want to get started with Chef right away (without the need to install your own Chef 
server) or want a third party to give you a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for your Chef server, 
you can sign up for hosted Chef by Chef Software, Inc. Chef Software, Inc. operates Chef as a 
cloud service. It's quick to set up and gives you full control, using users and groups to control 
the access permissions to your Chef setup. We'll configure knife, Chef's command-line tool to 
interact with hosted Chef, so that you can start managing your nodes.
Getting ready
Before being able to use hosted Chef, you need to sign up for the service. There is a free 
account for up to five nodes.
Visit http://manage.chef.io/signup and register for a free trial or a free account.
I registered as the user webops with an organization short name of awo.
After registering your account, it is time now to prepare your organization to be used with 
your chef-repo repository.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps in order to interact with the hosted Chef:
1.	 Create the configuration directory for your Chef client on your local workstation:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir .chef
2.	 Navigate to http://manage.chef.io/organizations. After logging in, 
you can start downloading your validation keys and configuration file.
3.	 Select your organization to be able to see its contents using the web UI.

Regenerate the validation key for your organization and save it as <your-
organization-short-name>-validator.pem in the chef directory 
inside your chef-repo repository.
4.	 Generate the knife config and put the downloaded knife.rb into the .chef 
directory inside your chef-repo directory, as well. Make sure you have downloaded 
your user's private key from https://www.chef.io/account/password and 
replace webops with the username you chose for hosted Chef, and awo with the 
short name you chose for your organization:
current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
log_level                :info
log_location             STDOUT
node_name                "webops"
client_key               "#{current_dir}/webops.pem"
validation_client_name   "awo-validator"
validation_key           "#{current_dir}/awo-validator.pem"
chef_server_url          "https://api.chef.io/organizations/awo"
cache_type               'BasicFile'
cache_options( :path => "#{ENV['HOME']}/.chef/checksums" )
cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]
Take a look at the following code:
.chef/*.pem
.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
You should add the preceding code to your .gitingore file 
inside chef-repo to avoid your credentials from ending up in 
your Git repository.
5.	 Use knife to verify that you can connect to your hosted Chef organization. It should 
only have your validator client, so far. Instead of awo, you'll see your organization's 
short name:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife client list
awo-validator
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 1
9
How it works...
Hosted Chef uses two private keys (called validators):
f
f
one for the organization
f
f
one for every user.
You need to tell knife where it can find these two keys in your knife.rb file.
The following two lines of code in your knife.rb file tell the knife about which organization 
to use and where to find its private key. The validation_key is used to allow new clients 
to authenticate the Chef server before getting their own Client key:
validation_client_name   "awo-validator"
validation_key           "#{current_dir}/awo-validator.pem"
The following line of code in your knife.rb file tells the knife where to find your users' 
private key. It is used by your local workstation to authenticate the Chef server:
client_key               "#{current_dir}/webops.pem"
Also, the following line of code in your knife.rb file tells knife that you are using hosted 
Chef. You will find your organization name as the last part of the URL:
chef_server_url          "https://api.chef.io/organizations/awo"
Using the knife.rb file and your two validators knife, you can now connect to your 
organization hosted by Chef Software, Inc.
You do not need your own self-hosted Chef server, nor do you need to use Chef client local 
mode in this setup.
There's more...
This setup is good for you if you do not want to worry about running, scaling, and updating 
your own Chef server and if you're happy with saving all your configuration data in the Cloud 
(under the control of Chef Software, Inc.).
If you need to have all your configuration data within your own network 
boundaries, you can install Chef server on premises by choosing "ON 
PREMISES CHEF" at https://www.chef.io/chef/choose-
your- version/ or install the Open Source version of Chef server 
directly from GitHub at https://github.com/chef/chef.

Managing virtual machines with Vagrant
Developing Chef cookbooks requires you to run your work in progress cookbooks multiple 
times on your nodes. To make sure they work, you need a clean, initial state of your nodes 
every time you run them. You can achieve this by using a virtual machine (VM). However, 
manually setting up and destroying VMs is tedious and breaks your development flow.
Vagrant is a command-line tool, which provides you with a configurable, reproducible, and 
portable development environment by enabling you to manage VMs. It lets you define and use 
preconfigured disk images to create new VMs from. Also, you can configure Vagrant to use 
provisioners such as Shell scripts, Puppet, or Chef to bring your VM into the desired state.
In this recipe, we will see how to use Vagrant to manage VMs using VirtualBox and Chef client 
as the provisioner.
Getting ready
Download and install VirtualBox at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
Download and install Vagrant at https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.
Install the Omnibus Vagrant plugin to enable Vagrant to install the Chef client on your VM by 
running the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
Installing the 'vagrant-omnibus' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-omnibus (1.4.1)'!
How to do it...
Let's create and boot a virtual node by using Vagrant:
1.	 Visit https://github.com/opscode/bento and choose a Vagrant box to base 
your VMs on. We'll use opscode-ubuntu-14.10 in this example.
2.	 The URL of the opscode-ubuntu-14.10 box is https://opscode-vm-bento.
s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_ubuntu-14.10_chef-
provisionerless.box.

Chapter 1
11
3.	 Edit your new Vagrantfile. Make sure that you replace <YOUR-ORG> with the 
name of your organization on the Chef server. Use the name and URL of the box file 
you noted down in the first step as config.vm.box and config.vm.box_url:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "opscode-ubuntu-14.10"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/
vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_ubuntu-14.10_chef-provisionerless.box"
  config.omnibus.chef_version = :latest
  config.vm.provision :chef_client do |chef|
    chef.provisioning_path = "/etc/chef"
    chef.chef_server_url = "https://api.chef.io/
organizations/<YOUR_ORG>"
    chef.validation_key_path = ".chef/<YOUR_ORG>-validator.pem"
    chef.validation_client_name = "<YOUR_ORG>-validator"
    chef.node_name = "server"
  end
end
4.	 Create your virtual node using Vagrant:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ vagrant up

nodes and validate that your new virtual machine shows up as a registered node:
How it works...
The Vagrantfile is written in a Ruby Domain Specific Language (DSL) to configure 
the Vagrant virtual machines. We want to boot a simple Ubuntu VM. Let's go through the 
Vagrantfile step by step.
First, we create a config object. Vagrant will use this config object to configure the VM:
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
end
Inside the config block, we tell Vagrant which VM image to use, in order to boot the node:
config.vm.box = "opscode-ubuntu-14.10"
config.vm.box_url = "https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/
vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_ubuntu-14.10_chef-provisionerless.box"
We want to boot our VM using a so-called Bento Box, provided by Chef. We use Ubuntu Version 
14.10 here.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 1
13
If you have never used the box before, Vagrant will download the image file 
(a few hundred megabytes) when you run vagrant up for the first time.
As we want our VM to have the Chef client installed, we tell the omnibus vagrant plugin to use 
the latest version of Chef client:
  config.omnibus.chef_version = :latest
After selecting the VM image to boot, we configure how to provision the box by using Chef. The 
Chef configuration happens in a nested Ruby block:
  config.vm.provision :chef_client do |chef|
  ...
  end
Inside this Chef block, we need to instruct Vagrant on how to hook up our virtual node to the 
Chef server. First, we need to tell Vagrant where to store all the Chef stuff on your node:
    chef.provisioning_path = "/etc/chef"
Vagrant needs to know the API endpoint of your Chef server. If you use hosted Chef, it is 
https://api.chef.io/organizations/<YOUR_ORG>. You need to replace <YOUR_
ORG> with the name of the organization that you created in your account on hosted Chef. If 
you are using your own Chef server, change the URL accordingly:
    chef.chef_server_url = "https://api.chef.io/organizations/<YOUR_
ORG>"
While creating your organization on hosted Chef, you must download your private key. Tell 
Vagrant where to find this file:
    chef.validation_key_path = ".chef/<YOUR_ORG>—validator.pem"
Also, you need to tell Vagrant as to which client it should validate itself against the Chef 
server:
    chef.validation_client_name = "<YOUR_ORG>-validator"
Finally, you should tell Vagrant how to name your node:
    chef.node_name = "server"
After configuring your Vagrantfile, all you need to do is run the basic Vagrant commands 
such as vagrant up, vagrant provision, and vagrant ssh. To stop your VM, just run 
the vagrant halt command.

There's more...
If you want to start from scratch again, you will have to destroy your VM and delete both the 
client and the node from your Chef server by running the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ vagrant destroy
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node delete server -y && knife client 
delete server -y
Alternatively, you may use the Vagrant Butcher plugin found at https://github.com/
cassianoleal/vagrant-butcher.
Don't blindly trust Vagrant boxes downloaded from the Web; you never 
know what they contain.

Creating and using cookbooks
Cookbooks are an essential part of Chef. You can easily create them using the Chef executable 
installed by the Chef DK. In this recipe (and many of the following recipes), I will assume that 
you're using a Chef server to manage your infrastructure. You can either set up your own 
cookbook or use the hosted Chef as described previously. You'll use the command-line tool 
knife to interact with the Chef server.
In this recipe, we'll create and apply a simple cookbook using the Chef and knife command-line 
tools.
Getting ready
Make sure you have Chef DK installed and a node available for testing. Check out the 
installation instructions at http://learn.chef.io if you need help here.

Edit your knife.rb file (usually found in the hidden .chef directory) and add the following 
three lines to it, filling in your own values:
cookbook_copyright "your company"
cookbook_license "apachev2"
cookbook_email "your email address"
The Apache 2 license is the most commonly found in cookbooks, but 
you're free to choose whichever suits your needs. If you put none as 
cookbook_license, knife will put "All rights reserved" 
into your recipe's metadata file.
Chef will use the preceding values as default whenever you create a new cookbook.
We assume that you have a node called server registered with your Chef server, as 
described in the Managing virtual machines with Vagrant section in this chapter.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create and use cookbooks:
1.	 Create a cookbook named my_cookbook by running the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/my_
cookbook
Compiling Cookbooks...
Recipe: code_generator::cookbook
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Before ChefDK was introduced, the only way to generate cookbooks was to use 
knife cookbook create my_cookbook
2.	 Upload your new cookbook on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
3.	 Add the cookbook to your node's run list. In this example, the name of the node is 
server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server 
'recipe[my_cookbook]'
server:
  run_list: recipe[my_cookbook]

4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
If you're using a Vagrant VM as your server, you need to make sure to 
run vagrant up and vagrant ssh in order to be able to execute 
the Chef client on the node.
How it works...
The chef executable helps you to manage your local Chef development environment. 
We used it here to generate the cookbook.
Knife is the command-line interface for the Chef server. It uses the RESTful API exposed 
by the Chef server to do its work and helps you to interact with the Chef server.
The knife command supports a host of commands structured as follows:
knife <subject> <command>
The <subject> used in this section is either cookbook or node. The commands we use 
are upload for the cookbook, and run_list add for the node.

Inspecting files on your Chef server with

Sometimes, you may want to peek into the files stored on your Chef server. You might not 
be sure about an implementation detail of that specific cookbook version, which is currently 
installed on your Chef server, and need to look it up. Knife can help you out by letting you 
show various aspects of the files stored on your Chef server.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have the iptables cookbook installed locally and uploaded on your 
Chef server.

2.	 Upload the iptables cookbook on your Chef server by executing the following given 
command and code lines:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload iptables
Uploading iptables       [0.14.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
How to do it...
Let's find out how knife can help you to look into a cookbook stored in your Chef server:
1.	 First, you want to find out the current version of the cookbook you're interested in. 
In our case, we're interested in the iptables cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/work/chef_helpster $ knife cookbook show iptables
iptables   0.14.0
2.	 Then, you can look up the definitions of the iptables cookbook, using the version 
number that you found out in the previous step:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook show iptables 0.14.0 
definitions
  checksum:     45c0b77ff10d7177627694827ce47340
  name:         iptables_rule.rb
  path:         definitions/iptables_rule.rb
  specificity:  default
  url:          https://s3.amazonaws.com/opscode-platform...
3.	 Now, you can even show the contents of the iptables_rule.rb definition file, 
as stored on the server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook show iptables 0.14.0 
definitions iptables_rule.rb
#
# Cookbook Name:: iptables

# Definition:: iptables_rule
#
#
define :iptables_rule, :enable => true, :source => nil, :variables 
=> {} do
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
end
How it works...
The knife cookbook show subcommand helps you understand what exactly is stored on 
the Chef server. It lets you drill down into specific sections of your cookbooks and see the 
exact content of the files stored in your Chef server.
There's more...
Since Chef 11, you can pass patterns to the knife show command to tell it what exactly you 
want to see. Showing the contents of the iptables_rule definition can be done as follows, 
in addition to the way we described previously:
mma@laptop:~/work/chef_helpster $ knife show cookbooks/iptables/
definitions/*
cookbooks/iptables/definitions/iptables_rule.rb:
#
# Cookbook Name:: iptables
# Definition:: iptables_rule
#
#
define :iptables_rule, :enable => true, :source => nil, :variables => 
{} do
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
end

Defining cookbook dependencies
Quite often, you might want to use features of other cookbooks in your own cookbooks. For 
example, if you want to make sure that all packages required for compiling software written 
in C are installed, you might want to include the build-essential cookbook, which does 
just that. Chef server needs to know about such dependencies in your cookbooks. You declare 
them in a cookbook's metadata.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook named my_cookbook, and the run_list command of 
your node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks 
recipe in this chapter.
How to do it...
Edit the metadata of your cookbook in the file cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb to 
add a dependency to the build-essential cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends 'build-essential'
depends 'apache2', '>= 1.0.4'
How it works...
If you want to use a feature of another cookbook inside your cookbook, you will need to 
include the other cookbook in your recipe using the include_recipe directive:
include_recipe 'build-essential'
To tell the Chef server that your cookbook requires the build-essential cookbook, you need 
to declare that dependency in the metadata.rb file. If you uploaded all the dependencies 
to your Chef server either using berks install and berks upload or knife cookbook 
upload ..., the Chef server will then send all the required cookbooks to the node.
The first depends call tells the Chef server that your cookbook depends 
on the latest version of the build-essential cookbook.

The second depends call tells the Chef server that your cookbook depends on a version of 
the apache2 cookbook, which is greater or equal to the version 1.0.4. You may use any of 
these version constraints with your depends calls:
f
f
< (less than)
f
f
<= (less than or equal to)
f
f
= (equal to)
f
f
>= (greater than or equal to)
f
f
~> (approximately greater than)
f
f
> (greater than)
There's more...
If you include another recipe inside your recipe, without declaring the cookbook dependency 
in your metadata.rb file, Foodcritic will warn you:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ foodcritic cookbooks/my_cookbook
FC007: Ensure recipe dependencies are reflected in cookbook metadata: 
cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb:9
Foodcritic will just return an empty line, if it doesn't find any issues.
Additionally, you can declare conflicting cookbooks through the conflicts call:
conflicts "nginx"
Of course, you can use version constraints exactly the way you did with depends.

Managing cookbook dependencies with 
Berkshelf
It's a pain to manually ensure that you have installed all the cookbooks that another cookbook 
depends on. You have to download each and every one of them manually only to find out that 
with each downloaded cookbook, you inherit another set of dependent cookbooks.
And even if you use knife cookbook site install, which installs all the dependencies 
locally for you, your cookbook directory and your repository get cluttered with all those 
cookbooks. Usually, you don't really care about all those cookbooks and don't want to see 
or manage them.
This is where Berkshelf comes into play. It works like Bundler for Ruby gems, managing 
cookbook dependencies for you. Berkshelf downloads all the dependencies you defined 
recursively and helps you to upload all cookbooks to your Chef server.
Instead of polluting your Chef repository, it stores all the cookbooks in a central location. You 
just commit your Berkshelf dependency file (called Berksfile) to your repository, and every 
colleague or build server can download and install all those dependent cookbooks based on it.
Let's see how to use Berkshelf to manage the dependencies of your cookbook.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe.
How to do it...
Berkshelf helps you to keep those utility cookbooks out of your Chef repository. This makes 
it much easier to maintain the cookbooks, which really matter.
Let's see how to write a cookbook by running a bunch of utility recipes and manage the 
required cookbooks with Berkshelf:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "chef-client"
depends "apt"
depends "ntp"
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chef Infrastructure
22
2.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
...
include_recipe "chef-client"
include_recipe "apt"
include_recipe "ntp"
3.	 Run Berkshelf to install all the required cookbooks:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cd cookbooks/my_cookbook
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ berks install
Resolving cookbook dependencies...
Fetching 'my_cookbook' from source at .
Fetching cookbook index from https://supermarket.chef.io...
Installing apt (2.6.0) from https://supermarket.chef.io ([opscode] 
https://supermarket.chef.io/api/v1)

4.	 Upload all the cookbooks on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ berks upload

Uploading windows (1.34.8) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/
organizations/awo
How it works...
Berkshelf comes with the Chef DK.
We create our cookbook and tell it to use a few basic cookbooks.
Instead of making us manually install all the cookbooks using knife cookbook site 
install, chef generate creates a Berksfile, besides the metadata.rb file.
The Berksfile is pretty simple. It tells Berkshelf to use the Chef supermarket as the default 
source for all cookbooks:
source "https://supermarket.chef.io"
It tells Berkshelf to read the metadata.rb file to find all the required cookbooks. This is the 
simplest way when working inside a single cookbook. Please see the following There's more… 
section to find an example of a more advanced usage of the Berksfile.

Chapter 1
23
After telling Berkshelf where to find all the required cookbook names, we use it to install all 
those cookbooks:
berks install
Berkshelf stores cookbooks in ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks, by default. This keeps your Chef 
repository clutter-free. Instead of having to manage all the required cookbooks inside your 
own Chef repository, Berkshelf takes care of them. You simply need to check in Berksfile 
with your recipe, and everyone using your recipe can download all the required cookbooks by 
using Berkshelf.
To make sure that there's no mix-up with different cookbook versions when sharing your 
cookbook, Berkshelf creates a file called Berksfile.lock alongside Berksfile. Here, 
you'll find the exact versions of all the cookbooks that Berkshelf installed:
DEPENDENCIES
  my_cookbook
    path: .
    metadata: true
GRAPH
  apt (2.6.0)
  chef-client (3.9.0)
    cron (>= 1.2.0)
    logrotate (>= 1.2.0)
    windows (~> 1.11)
  chef_handler (1.1.6)
  cron (1.6.1)
  logrotate (1.7.0)
  my_cookbook (0.1.0)
    apt (>= 0.0.0)
    chef-client (>= 0.0.0)
    ntp (>= 0.0.0)
  ntp (1.6.8)
  windows (1.34.8)
    chef_handler (>= 0.0.0)
Berkshelf will only use the exact versions specified in the Berksfile.lock file, if it finds this file.
Finally, we use Berkshelf to upload all the required cookbooks on the Chef server:
berks upload

There's more...
Berkshelf integrates tightly with Vagrant via the vagrant-berkshelf plugin. You can 
set up Berkshelf and Vagrant in such a way that Berkshelf installs and uploads all the 
required cookbooks on your Chef server whenever you execute vagrant up or vagrant 
provision. You'll save all the work of running berks install and berks upload 
manually before creating your node with Vagrant.
Let's see how you can integrate Berkshelf and Vagrant.
First, you need to install the Berkshelf plugin for Vagrant:
mma@mma-mbp:~/work/chef-repo (master)$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-
berkshelf
Installing the 'vagrant-berkshelf' plugin. This can take a few 
minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-berkshelf (4.0.1)'!
Then, you need to tell Vagrant that you want to use the plugin. You do this by enabling the 
plugin in Vagrantfile:
mma@mma-mbp:~/work/chef-repo (master)$ subl Vagrantfile
config.berkshelf.enabled = true
Then, you need a Berksfile in the root directory of your Chef repository to tell Berkshelf which 
cookbooks to install on each Vagrant run:
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: 'cookbooks/my_cookbook'
Eventually, you can start your VM using Vagrant. Berkshelf will first download and then install 
all the required cookbooks in the Berkshelf, and upload them on the Chef server. Only after 
all the cookbooks are made available on the Chef server by Berkshelf, will Vagrant go on:
mma@mma-mbp:~/work/chef-repo $ vagrant up

Downloading and integrating cookbooks as 
vendor branches into your Git repository
The Chef community offers a wide variety of ready-made cookbooks for many major software 
packages. They're a great starting point for your own infrastructure. However, usually you 
need to modify these cookbooks to suit your needs. Modifying your local copy of a community 
cookbook leaves you with the dilemma of not being able to update to the latest version of the 
community cookbook without losing your local changes.
Getting ready
You'll need to make sure that your local Git repository is clean and does not have any 
uncommitted changes:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)

How to do it...
Carry out the following given steps:
1.	 Go to https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks and search for the cookbook 
you need. In our example, we will use the mysql cookbook, which you can find by 
typing mysql in the search box and hitting enter. All we need is to note down the 
exact name of the cookbook; in this case, it's simply mysql.
2.	 Use knife to pull down the cookbook and integrate it with your local repository:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook site install mysql
Installing mysql to /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks

How it works...
Knife executes a set of commands to download the desired cookbook and to integrate it with 
your local repository.
Let's take a look at the output of the knife cookbook site install command again 
and go through it step-by-step:
1.	 First, the command makes sure that you're on the master branch of your repository:
Checking out the master branch.
2.	 The next step is to create a new vendor branch for the mysql cookbook, if none 
exists so far:
Creating pristine copy branch chef-vendor-mysql.
3.	 Then, knife downloads the tarball, removes any older version, uncompresses the new 
tarball, and removes it after successfully extracting its contents into a new cookbook 
directory:
Downloading mysql from the cookbooks site at version 5.6.1 to /
Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/mysql.tar.gz
Cookbook saved: /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/mysql.tar.gz
Removing pre-existing version.
Uncompressing mysql version 5.6.1.
Removing downloaded tarball
4.	 Now, it's time to commit the newly extracted files to the vendor branch:
1 files updated, committing changes
5.	 Finally, Git tags the branch with the current version of the cookbook:
Creating tag cookbook-site-imported-mysql-5.6.1
The knife cookbook site install command executes all the previously mentioned 
steps for all the cookbooks the desired cookbook depends on, by default.
Eventually, you end up with a separate branch, the so-called vendor branch, for every 
downloaded cookbook integrated into your master branch and nicely tagged as shown:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo$ git branch -a
  chef-vendor-iptables
  chef-vendor-mysql
* master
  remotes/origin/master
This approach enables you to change whatever you like in your master branch and still pull 
down newer versions of the community cookbook. Git will automatically merge both versions 
or ask you to remove conflicts manually; these are standard Git procedures.

There's more...
If you want to integrate the desired cookbook into another branch, use the --branch 
BRANCH_NAME parameter.
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo [experimental] $ knife cookbook site install mysql 
–-branch experimental
Installing mysql to /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks
Checking out the experimental branch.
Pristine copy branch (chef-vendor-mysql) exists, switching to it.
Downloading mysql from the cookbooks site at version 5.6.1 to /Users/
mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/mysql.tar.gz

Removing pre-existing version.
Uncompressing mysql version 5.6.1.
removing downloaded tarball
No changes made to mysql
Checking out the experimental branch.
…TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
As you can see, instead of checking out the master branch, the knife cookbook site 
install command uses the experimental branch now.
You can use the -D switch when running the command in order to avoid downloading all the 
cookbooks that your desired cookbook depends on.
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook site install mysql -D
Installing mysql to /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks
Checking out the master branch.
Pristine copy branch (chef-vendor-mysql) exists, switching to it.
Downloading mysql from the cookbooks site at version 5.6.1 to /Users/

Removing pre-existing version.
Uncompressing mysql version 5.6.1.

You can see that the command stopped after dealing with the mysql cookbook. It has not 
yet gotten the other cookbooks.

Using custom knife plugins
Knife comes with a set of commands out of the box. The built-in commands deal with the basic 
elements of Chef-like cookbooks, roles, data bags, and so on. However, it would be nice to use 
knife for more than just the basic stuff. Fortunately, knife comes with a plugin API and there are 
already a host of useful knife plugins built by the makers of Chef and the Chef community.
Getting ready
Make sure you have an account at Amazon Web Services (AWS) if you want to follow along 
and try out the knife-ec2 plugin. There are knife plugins available for most Cloud providers. 
Go through the There's more... section of this recipe for the list.
How to do it...
Let's see which knife plugins are available, and try to use one to manage Amazon EC2 
instances:
1.	 List the knife plugins that are shipped as Ruby gems using the chef 
command-line tool:

0 GB     2
How it works...
Knife looks for plugins at various places.
First, it looks into the .chef directory, which is located inside your current Chef repository, 
to find the plugins specific to this repository:
./.chef/plugins/knife/
Then, it looks into the .chef directory, which is located in your home directory, to find the 
plugins that you want to use in all your Chef repositories:
~/.chef/plugins/knife/
Finally, it looks for installed gems. Knife will load all the code from any chef/knife/ 
directory found in your installed Ruby gems. This is the most common way of using plugins 
developed by Chef or the Chef community.
There's more...
There are hundreds of knife plugins, including plugins for most of the major Cloud providers, 
as well as the major virtualization technologies, such as VMware, vSphere, and Openstack, 
amongst others.

Deleting a node from the Chef server
Bootstrapping a node not only installs Chef on that node, but creates a client object on 
the Chef server as well. Running the Chef client on your node uses the client object to 
authenticate itself against the Chef server on each run.
Additionally, to registering a client, a node object is created on the Chef server. The node 
object is the main data structure, which you can use to query node data inside your recipes.
Getting ready
Make sure you have at least one node registered on your Chef server that is safe to remove.
How to do it...
Let's delete the node and client object to completely remove a node from the Chef server.
1.	 Delete the node object:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node delete my_node
Do you really want to delete my_node? (Y/N) y
Deleted node[my_node]
2.	 Delete the client object:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife client delete my_node
Do you really want to delete my_node? (Y/N) y
Deleted client[my_node]
How it works...
To keep your Chef server clean, it's important to not only manage your node objects but to 
also take care of your client objects, as well.

Knife connects to the Chef server and deletes the node object with a given name, using the 
Chef server RESTful API.
The same happens while deleting the client object on the Chef server.
After deleting both objects, your node is totally removed from the Chef server. Now, you can 
reuse the same node name with a new box or virtual machine.
There's more...
It is a bit tedious and error prone when you have to issue two commands. To simplify things, 
you can use a knife plugin called playground.
1.	 Run the chef command-line tool to install the knife plugin:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef gem install knife-playground
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Installing knife-playground (0.2.2)
2.	 Run the knife pg clientnode delete subcommand:

2.	 Validate that the Chef client run creates the desired temporary file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cat /tmp/local_mode.txt
created by chef client local mode%
How it works...
The -z parameter switches the Chef client into local mode. Local mode uses chef-zero—a 
simple, in-memory version of the Chef server provided by Chef DK—when converging the 
local workstation.
By providing the -o parameter, you override the run list of your local node so that the Chef 
client executes the default recipe from my_cookbook.
There's more...
Chef-zero saves all modifications made by your recipes to the local file system. It creates a 
JSON file containing all node attributes for your local workstation in the nodes directory. This 
way, the next time you run the Chef client in local mode, it will be aware of any changes your 
recipes made to the node.
Running knife in local mode
You can use knife in local mode, too. To set the run list of your node named laptop (instead 
of having to override it with -o), you can run the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add -z laptop 'recipe[my_
cookbook]'
Moving to hosted Chef or your own Chef server
When you're done editing and testing your cookbooks on your local workstation with 
chef-zero, you can seamlessly upload them to hosted Chef or your own Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife upload /
laptop:
  run_list: recipe[my_cookbook]

Using roles
Roles are there in Chef to group nodes with similar configuration. Typical cases are to have 
roles for web servers, database servers, and so on.
You can set custom run lists for all the nodes in your roles and override attribute values from 
within your roles.
Let's see how to create a simple role.
Getting ready
For the following examples, I assume that you have a node named server and that you have 
at least one cookbook (I'll use the ntp cookbook) registered with your Chef server.
How to do it...
Let's create a role and see what we can do with it.
1.	 Create a role:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/web_servers.rb
name "web_servers"
description "This role contains nodes, which act as web servers"
run_list "recipe[ntp]"
default_attributes 'ntp' => {
  'ntpdate' => {
    'disable' => true
  }
}
2.	 Upload the role on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file web_servers.rb
Updated Role web_servers!
3.	 Assign the role to a node called server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server 'role[web_
servers]'
server:
  run_list: role[web_servers]
4.	 Run the Chef client:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client

[2014-12-25T13:28:24+00:00] INFO: Run List expands to [ntp]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
You define a role in a Ruby file inside the roles folder of your Chef repository. A role consists 
of a name attribute and a description attribute. Additionally, a role usually contains a 
role-specific run list and role-specific attribute settings.
Every node, which has a role in its run list, will have the role's run list expanded into its own. 
This means that all the recipes (and roles), which are in the role's run list, will be executed 
on your nodes.
You need to upload your role on your Chef server by using the knife role from 
file command.
Only then should you add the role to your node's run list.
Running the Chef client on a node having your role in its run list will execute all the recipes 
listed in the role.
The attributes you define in your role will be merged with attributes from environments and 
cookbooks, according to the precedence rules described at https://docs.chef.io/
roles.html#attribute-precedence.

Using environments
Having separate environments for development, testing, and production are good ways to be 
able to develop and test cookbook updates and other configuration changes in isolation. Chef 
enables you to group your nodes into separate environments so as to support an ordered 
development flow.

Getting ready
For the following examples, I assume that you have a node named server in the _default 
environment and that you have at least one cookbook (I'll use the ntp cookbook) registered 
with your Chef server.
How to do it...
Let's see how to manipulate environments using knife.
This is only a good idea if you want to play around. For serious 
work, please create files describing your environments and put 
them under version control as described in the There's more... 
section of this recipe.
1.	 Create your environment on the fly using knife. The following command will open your 
shell's default editor so that you can modify the environment definition:
Make sure you've set your EDITOR environment variable to your 
preferred one.
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife environment create book
{
  "name": "book",
  "description": "",
  "cookbook_versions": {
  },
  "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
  "chef_type": "environment",
  "default_attributes": {
  },
  "override_attributes": {
  }
}
Created book
2.	 List the available environments:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife environment list

book

3.	 List the nodes for all the environments:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node list
server
4.	 Verify that the node server is not in the book environment yet by listing nodes in 
the book environment only:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node list -E book
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $
5.	 Change the environment of server to book using knife:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node environment set server book
server:
  chef_environment: book
6.	 List the nodes of the book environment again:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node list -E book
server
7.	
Use specific cookbook versions and override certain attributes for the environment:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife environment edit book
{
  "name": "book",
  "description": "",
  "cookbook_versions": {
    "ntp": "1.6.8"
  },
  "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
  "chef_type": "environment",
  "default_attributes": {
  },
  "override_attributes": {
    "ntp": {
      "servers": ["0.europe.pool.ntp.org", "1.europe.pool.ntp.

How it works...
A common use of environments is to promote cookbook updates from development to staging 
and then into production. Additionally, they enable you to use different cookbook versions 
on separate sets of nodes and environment-specific attributes. You might have nodes with 
lesser memory in your staging environment as in your production environment. By using 
environment-specific default attributes, you can, for example, configure your MySQL service 
to consume lesser memory on staging than on production.
The Chef server always has an environment called _default, which 
cannot be edited or deleted. All the nodes go in there if you don't 
specify any other environment.
Be aware that roles are not environment-specific. You may use environment-specific run 
lists, though.
The node's environment can be queried using the node.chef_environment method inside 
your cookbooks.
There's more...
If you want your environments to be under version control (and you should), a better way to 
create a new environment is to create a new Ruby file in the environments directory inside 
your Chef repository:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cd environments
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl book.rb
name "book"
You should add, commit, and push your new environment file to GitHub:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git add environments/book.rb
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git commit -a -m "the book env"
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git push
Now, can create the environment on the Chef server from the newly created file using knife:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife environment from file book.rb
Created Environment book
You have to deal with two artifact storages here. You have to use your 
version control system and knife / Berkshelf to sync your local changes 
to your Chef server. The Chef server is not aware of any changes that 
you do when using your version control system and vice versa.

There is a way to migrate all the nodes from one environment to another by using 
knife exec:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("chef_
environment:_default") { |n| n.chef_environment("book")
You can limit your search for nodes in a specific environment:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife search node "chef_environment:book"

Freezing cookbooks
Uploading broken cookbooks that override your working ones is a major pain and can result 
in widespread outage throughout your infrastructure. If you have a cookbook version that is 
known to work, it's a good idea to freeze this version so that no one can overwrite the same 
version with broken code. When used together with version constraints that are specified in 
your environment manifests, freezing cookbooks can keep your production servers safe from 
accidental changes.
Getting ready
Make sure you have at least one cookbook (I'll use the ntp cookbook) registered with your 
Chef server.
How to do it...
Let's see what happens if we freeze a cookbook.
1.	 Upload a cookbook and freeze it:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload ntp --freeze
Uploading ntp            [1.6.8]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
2.	 Try to upload the same cookbook version again:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload ntp
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chef Infrastructure
42
Uploading ntp            [1.6.8]
ERROR: Version 1.6.8 of cookbook ntp is frozen. Use --force to 
override.
WARNING: Not updating version constraints for ntp in the 
environment as the cookbook is frozen.
ERROR: Failed to upload 1 cookbook.
3.	 Change the cookbook version:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/ntp/metadata.rb
…
version           "1.6.9"
4.	 Upload the cookbook again:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload ntp
Uploading ntp            [1.6.9]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
How it works...
By using the --freeze option when uploading a cookbook, you tell the Chef server that 
it should not accept any changes to the same version of the cookbook anymore. This 
is important if you're using environments and want to make sure that your production 
environment cannot be broken by uploading a corrupted cookbook.
By changing the version number of your cookbook, you can upload the new version. Then you 
can make, for example, your staging environment use that new cookbook version.
There's more...
To support a more elaborate workflow, you can use the knife-spork knife plugin. It helps 
multiple developers work on the same Chef server and repository without treading on each 
other's toes. You can find more information about it at https://github.com/jonlives/
knife-spork.

Running Chef client as a daemon
While you can run the Chef client on your nodes manually whenever you change something 
in your Chef repository, it's sometimes preferable to have the Chef client run automatically 
every so often. Letting the Chef client run automatically makes sure that no box misses out 
any updates.
Getting ready
You need to have a node registered with your Chef server. It needs to be able to run chef-
client without any errors.
How to do it...
Let's see how to start the Chef client in the daemon mode so that it runs automatically.
1.	 Start the Chef client in the daemon mode, running every 30 minutes:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client -i 1800
2.	 Validate that the Chef client runs as daemon:
user@server:~$ ps auxw | grep chef-client
How it works...
The -i parameter will start the Chef client as a daemon. The given number is the seconds 
between each Chef client run. In the previous example, we specified 1,800 seconds, which 
results in the Chef client running every 30 minutes.
You can use the same command in a service startup script.
There's more...
Instead of running the Chef client as a daemon, you can use a Cronjob to run it every so often:
user@server:~$ subl /etc/cron.d/chef_client
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
# m h dom mon dow user command
*/15 * * * * root chef-client -l warn | grep -v 'retrying [1234]/5 in'
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chef Infrastructure
44
This cronjob will run the Chef client every 15 minutes and swallow the first four retrying 
warning messages. This is important to avoid Cron sending out e-mails if the Chef server 
is a little slow and the Chef client needs a few retries.
It is possible to initiate a Chef client run at any time by sending the 
SIGUSR1 signal to the Chef client daemon:
user@server:~$ sudo killall -USR1 chef-client
Using chef-shell
Writing cookbooks is hard. Being able to try out parts of a recipe interactively and using 
breakpoints really helps to understand how your recipes work.
Chef comes with chef-shell, which is essentially an interactive Ruby session with Chef. In 
chef-shell, you can create attributes, write recipes, and initialize Chef runs, among other 
things. Chef-shell allows you to evaluate parts of your recipes on the fly before uploading 
them to your Chef server and executeing complete cookbooks on your nodes.
How to do it...
Running chef-shell is straightforward.
1.	 Start chef-shell in standalone mode:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef-shell
loading configuration: none (standalone chef-shell session)
Session type: standalone
Loading......done.
This is the chef-shell.
 Chef Version: 11.18.0
 http://www.chef.io/chef
 http://docs.chef.io/
run `help' for help, `exit' or ^D to quit.

2.	 Switch to the attributes mode in chef-shell:
chef > attributes_mode
3.	 Set an attribute value to be used inside the recipe later:
chef:attributes > set[:title] = "Chef Cookbook"
 => "Chef Cookbook"
chef:attributes > quit
 => :attributes
chef >
4.	 Switch to the recipe mode:
chef > recipe_mode
5.	 Create a file resource inside a recipe, using the title attribute as content:
chef:recipe > file "/tmp/book.txt" do
chef:recipe >     content node.title
chef:recipe ?> end
 => <file[/tmp/book.txt] @name: "/tmp/book.txt" @noop: nil @
before: nil @params: {} @provider: Chef::Provider::File @allowed_
actions: [:nothing, :create, :delete, :touch, :create_if_missing] 
@action: "create" @updated: false @updated_by_last_action: false 
@supports: {} @ignore_failure: false @retries: 0 @retry_delay: 
2 @source_line: "(irb#1):1:in `irb_binding'" @elapsed_time: 0 @
resource_name: :file @path: "/tmp/book.txt" @backup: 5 @diff: nil 
@cookbook_name: nil @recipe_name: nil @content: "Chef Cookbook">
chef:recipe >
6.	 Initiate a Chef run to create the file with the given content:
chef:recipe > run_chef
[2014-12-12T22:26:42+01:00] INFO: Processing file[/tmp/book.txt] 
action create ((irb#1) line 1)
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
=> true
How it works...
Chef-shell starts an interactive Ruby Shell (IRB) session, which is enhanced with some 
Chef-specific features. It offers certain modes, such as attributes_mode or 
recipe_mode, which enable you to write commands like you would put them 
into attributes file or recipes.

Entering a resource command into the recipe context will create the given resource, but not 
run it yet. It's like Chef reading your recipe files and creating the resources but not yet running 
them. You can run all the resources you created within the recipe context using the run_chef 
command. This will execute all the resources on your local box and physically change your 
system. To play around with temporary files, your local box might do, but if you're going to do 
more invasive stuff, such as installing or removing packages, installing services, and so on, 
you might want to use chef-shell from within a Vagrant VM.
There's more...
Not only can you run chef-shell in standalone mode but you can also in Chef client mode. 
If you run it in Chef client mode, it will load the complete run list of your node and you'll 
be able to tweak it inside the chef-shell. You start the Chef client mode by using the run 
it --client parameter:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef-shell --client
You can configure which Chef server to connect it to in a file called chef-shell.rb, 
in the same way as you do in the client.rb file on your local workstation.
You can use chef-shell to manage your Chef server, for example, listing all nodes:
chef > nodes.list
[node[my_server]]
You can put breakpoints into your recipes. If it hits a breakpoint resource, chef-shell will stop 
the execution of the recipe and you'll be able to inspect the current state of your Chef run:
breakpoint "name" do
  action :break
end

Evaluating and Troubleshooting Cookbooks and Chef Runs

Introduction
Developing cookbooks and making sure your nodes converge to the desired state is a complex 
endeavor. You need transparency about what is really happening. This chapter will cover a lot 
of ways to see what's going on and make sure that everything is working as it should. From 
running basic checks on your cookbooks to a fully test driven development approach, we'll 
see what the Chef ecosystem has to offer.
Testing your Chef cookbooks
You know how annoying this is: you tweak a cookbook, upload it to your Chef server, start 
a Chef run on your node and, boom! It fails. What's even more annoying is that it fails not 
because a black hole absorbed your node and the whole data center that node lives in, 
but because you missed a mundane comma in the default recipe of the cookbook you just 
tweaked. Fortunately, there's a very quick and easy way to find such simple glitches before 
you go all in and try to run your cookbooks on real nodes.
Getting ready
Install the ntp cookbook by running the following code:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook site install ntp
Installing ntp to /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks
…TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
Cookbook ntp version 1.7.0 successfully installed
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to test your cookbooks:
1.	 Run knife cookbook test on a working cookbook, for example, the ntp 
cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook test ntp
checking ntp
Running syntax check on ntp

2.	 Now, let's break something in the ntp cookbook's default recipe by removing the 
comma at the end of the node['ntp']['varlibdir'], line:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/ntp/recipes/default.rb
...
[ node['ntp']['varlibdir'],
  node['ntp']['statsdir'] ].each do |ntpdir|
  directory ntpdir do
    owner node['ntp']['var_owner']
    group node['ntp']['var_group']
    mode 0755
  end
end
3.	 Run the test command again:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook test ntp
checking ntp
Running syntax check on ntp
Validating ruby files
FATAL: Cookbook file recipes/default.rb has a ruby syntax error:
FATAL: cookbooks/ntp/recipes/default.rb:25: syntax error, 
unexpected tIDENTIFIER, expecting ']'
FATAL:   node['ntp']['statsdir'] ].each do |ntpdir|
FATAL:       ^
FATAL: cookbooks/ntp/recipes/default.rb:25: syntax error, 
unexpected ']', expecting $end
FATAL:   node['ntp']['statsdir'] ].each do |ntpdir|
FATAL:                            ^
How it works...
knife cookbook test executes a Ruby syntax check on all Ruby files within the cookbook 
as well as on all ERB templates. It loops through all Ruby files and runs ruby -c against each 
of them. The ruby -c command causes Ruby to check the syntax of the script and 
quit without running it.
After going through all Ruby files, knife cookbook test goes through all ERB templates 
and pipes the rendered version created by erubis -x through ruby -c.

There's more...
The knife cookbook test command does only a very simple syntax check on the Ruby 
files and ERB templates. There exists a whole ecosystem of additional tools such as Foodcritic 
(a lint check for Chef cookbooks), ChefSpec (behavior-driven testing for Chef), and Test-
kitchen (an integration testing tool to run cookbooks on virtual servers), and then some. 
You can go fully test driven, if you want!

Flagging problems in your Chef cookbooks
Writing solid Chef recipes can be quite challenging. There are a couple of pitfalls, which you 
can easily overlook. Also, writing cookbooks in a consistent style is even harder. You might 
wonder what the proven ways to write cookbooks are. Foodcritic tries to identify possible 
issues with the logic and style of your cookbooks.
In this section, you'll learn how to use Foodcritic on some existing cookbooks.

How it works...
Foodcritic defines a set of rules and checks your recipes against each of them. It comes with 
rules concerning various areas: style, correctness, attributes, strings, portability, search, 
services, files, metadata, and so on. Running Foodcritic against a cookbook tells you which 
of its rules matched a certain part of your cookbook. By default, it gives you a short explanation 
of what you should do along the concerned file and line number.
If you run foodcritic -C, it displays the excerpts of the places where it found the rules 
to match.
In the preceding example, it didn't like that the mysql cookbook uses symbols to access 
node attributes instead of strings:
@pkginfo.set[:suse]['11.3']['5.5'][:server_package] = 'mysql'

This could be rewritten as follows:
@pkginfo.set['suse']['11.3']['5.5']['server_package'] = 'mysql'
There's more...
Some of the rules, especially the ones from the styles section, are opinionated. You're able to 
exclude certain rules or complete sets of rules, such as style, when running Foodcritic:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ foodcritic -t '~style' ./cookbooks/mysql
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $
In this case, the tilde negates the tag selection to exclude all rules with the style tag. 
Running without the tilde would run the style rules exclusively:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ foodcritic -t style ./cookbooks/mysql
If you want to run foodcritic in a continuous integration (CI) environment, you can 
use the -f parameter to indicate which rules should fail the build:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ foodcritic -f style ./cookbooks/mysql
…TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
FC001: Use strings in preference to symbols to access node attributes: 
./cookbooks/mysql/libraries/helpers.rb:273
FC005: Avoid repetition of resource declarations: ./cookbooks/mysql/
libraries/provider_mysql_service.rb:77
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ echo $?
3
In this example, we tell Foodcritic to fail if any rule of the style group fails. In our case, 
it returns a non-zero exit code instead of zero, as it would if either no rule matches or we 
omit the -f parameter. That non-zero exit code would fail your build on your continuous 
integration server.

Test-driven development for cookbooks 
using ChefSpec
Test-driven development (TDD) is a way to write unit tests before writing any recipe code. 
By writing the test first, you design what your recipe should do and ensure that your test is 
for real because it should fail, as long as you haven't written your recipe code.
As soon as you've completed your recipe, your unit tests should pass.
ChefSpec is built on the popular RSpec framework and offers a tailored syntax to test 
Chef recipes.
Let's develop a very simple recipe using the TDD approach with ChefSpec.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's write a failing test first and then a recipe, which will pass the test:
1.	 Create the spec directory for your cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir cookbooks/my_cookbook/spec
2.	 Create your spec file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/spec/default_spec.rb
require 'chefspec'
describe 'my_cookbook::default' do
  let(:chef_run) {
    ChefSpec::ServerRunner.new(
      platform:'ubuntu', version:'12.04'
    ).converge(described_recipe)
  }
  
  it 'creates a greetings file, containing the platform 
    name' do
    expect(chef_run).to 
      render_file('/tmp/greeting.txt').with_content('Hello! 
ubuntu!')
  end

mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates
6.	 Create the template file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/greeting.txt.erb

1 example, 0 failures
How it works...
First, you need to set up a basic infrastructure in order to use RSpec with Chef. The ChefDK 
comes with ChefSpec preinstalled but your cookbook needs a directory called spec, in which 
all your tests will live.
When everything is set up, we're ready to start. Following the Test First approach of TDD, 
we create our spec before we write our recipe.
Every spec needs the chefspec gem:
require 'chefspec'
The main part of every spec is a describe block, where you tell RSpec which recipe you 
want to test. Here, you want to test the default recipe of your cookbook:
describe 'my_cookbook::default' do
  ...
end
Now, it's time to create the object that simulates the Chef run. Note that ChefSpec will 
not really run your recipe, but simulate a Chef run so that you can verify whether certain 
expectations you have about your recipe hold true.
By using RSpec's let call, you create a variable called chef_run, which you can use later 
to define your expectations.
The chef_run variable is a ChefSpec::ServerRunner object. We want to simulate a 
Chef run on Ubuntu 12.04. The parameters platform and version, which we pass to the 
constructor during the ChefSpec::ServerRunner.new call, populate the automatic node 
attributes so that it looks as though we performed our Chef run on an Ubuntu 12.04 node. 
ChefSpec uses Fauxhai to simulate the automatic node attributes as they would occur on 
various operating systems:
let(:chef_run) {
    ChefSpec::ServerRunner.new(
      platform:'ubuntu', version:'12.04'
    ).converge(described_recipe)
}

56
You can retrieve the recipe under test using the described_recipe call instead of typing 
my_cookbook::default again. Using described_recipe instead of the recipe name will 
keep you from repeating the recipe name in every it-block. It will keep your spec DRY (Don't 
Repeat Yourself):
ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new(...).converge(described_recipe)
Finally, we define what we expect our recipe to do.
We describe what we expect our recipe to do with the it-statements. Our description 
of the it-call will show up in the error message, if this test fails:
it 'creates a greetings file, containing the platform name' do
  ...
end
Now it's finally time to formulate our exact expectations. We use the standard RSpec syntax 
to define our expectations:
expect(...).to ...
Every expectation works on the simulated Chef run object, which was defined earlier.
We use a ChefSpec-specific matcher called render_file with the filename and chain it 
with a call to with_content to tell our spec what our recipe should do.
... render_file('/tmp/greeting.txt').with_content('Hello! ubuntu!')
On the ChefSpec site, you will find the complete list of custom matchers that you can use 
to test your recipes in the ChefSpec README at https://github.com/sethvargo/
chefspec#making-assertions.
After defining our spec, it's time to run it and check whether it fails:
$ rspec cookbooks/my_cookbook/spec/default_spec.rb
Next, we write our recipe. We use the template resource to create a file with the contents 
as specified in the spec.
Finally, we run rspec again to see our spec pass!
There's more...
You can modify your node attributes before simulating the Chef run:
  it 'uses a node attribute as greeting text' do
    chef_run.node.override['my_cookbook']['greeting'] = "Go!"
    expect(chef_run).to 
      render_file('/tmp/greeting.txt').with_content('Go! ubuntu!')

Integration testing your Chef cookbooks 
with Test Kitchen
Verifying that your cookbooks really work when converging a node is essential. Only if you can 
trust your cookbooks, you are ready to run them anytime on your production servers.
Test Kitchen is Chef's integration testing framework. It enables you to write tests, which run 
after a VM is instantiated and converged, using your cookbook. Your tests run in that VM and 
can verify that everything works as expected.
This is in contrast to ChefSpec, which only simulates a Chef run. Test Kitchen boots up a real 
node and runs Chef on it. Your tests see the real thing.
Let's see how you can write such integration tests for your cookbooks.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook named my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and 
using cookbooks recipe in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Make sure you have Vagrant installed, as described in the Managing virtual machines with 
Vagrant recipe in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's create a very simple recipe and use Test Kitchen and Serverspec to run a full 
integration test with Vagrant:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
file "/tmp/greeting.txt" do
  content node['my_cookbook']['greeting']
end
2.	 Edit your cookbook's default attributes:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 2
59
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb
default['my_cookbook']['greeting'] = "Ohai, Chefs!"
3.	 Change to your cookbook directory:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cd cookbooks/my_cookbook
4.	 Initialize Test Kitchen for your cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ kitchen init
      create  .kitchen.yml
      create  test/integration/default
Successfully installed kitchen-vagrant-0.16.0
1 gem installed
5.	 Edit the generated Test Kitchen configuration file to only test against Ubuntu 14.04:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ subl .kitchen.yml
...
 platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-14.04
 ...
6.	 Create a directory for your Serverspec files inside your cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ mkdir -p test/
integration/default/serverspec
7.	
Create your spec, defining what you expect your cookbook to do:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ subl test/
integration/default/serverspec/greeting_spec.rb
require 'serverspec'
# Required by serverspec
set :backend, :exec
describe file('/tmp/greeting.txt') do
its(:content) { should match 'Ohai, Chefs!' }
end
8.	 Run Test Kitchen:

How it works...
First, we create a very simple recipe, which writes the value of a node attribute to a file.
Then, it's time to configure Test Kitchen. You do this by running kitchen init, which 
creates a .kitchen.yml file in your cookbook directory. It consists of four parts:
1.	 Part one defines which driver you want Test Kitchen to use to create virtual machines 
(VMs) for testing. We use Vagrant to spin up VMs:
driver:
  name: vagrant
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 2
61
2.	 Part two defines how you want to use Chef on your test VMs. We don't want to use a 
Chef server, so we keep the default Chef solo:
provisioner:
  - name: chef_solo
3.	 Part three defines on which platforms you want to test your cookbook. To keep things 
simple, we only define Ubuntu 14.04 here. Test Kitchen will always create and destroy 
new instances. You do not have to fear any side effects with Vagrant VMs you spin up 
using your Vagrantfile:
platforms:
- name: ubuntu-14.04
4.	 Part four defines the test suites. We define one called default. We include our 
my_cookbook::default recipe here so that we're able to test what it does:
suites:
- name: default
  run_list:
  - recipe[my_cookbook::default]
  attributes:
Now, it's time to create our specs using Serverspec. Test Kitchen uses a naming convention 
inside the test/integration directory to discover the test framework to use for each 
test suite. In our case, we run the default test suite by using serverspec as the testing 
framework. That's why our directory structure looks like this:
test/integration/default/serverspec
We call our spec greeting_spec.rb and put it inside the aforementioned directory, so 
that Test Kitchen will automatically pick it up and run it.
After some boilerplate code, we describe what we expect our recipe to do:
describe file('/tmp/greeting.txt') do
  its(:content) { should match 'Ohai, Chefs!' }
end
Serverspec provides you with custom RSpec matchers to verify the status of your systems. 
You can find a complete list of the supported resource types here: http://serverspec.
org/resource_types.html.
Finally, we can run Test Kitchen. It will first make sure that no old VMs are around and then 
create a new one. It installs Chef on that brand new VM and starts a Chef run. Test Kitchen 
uses Busser to install the desired test framework (as defined by the directory structure 
below test/integration) and execute our specs after the node converges.

If everything works, Test Kitchen destroys the VM again.
If something fails, Test Kitchen keeps the VM and you can analyze it by running 
kitchen login.
There's more...
You don't have to run kitchen test every time you change something. If you change your 
cookbook, you can run kitchen converge to re-apply your changes to an existing VM.
To run your test suite after your node converged, you use kitchen verify.
Test Kitchen does not only support Vagrant but a host of other cloud providers such as 
OpenStack, EC2, Rackspace, Joyent, and many more. Just make sure you use the matching 
driver in your .kitchen.yml file.
You can define multiple different platforms, such as other Ubuntu versions or CentOS 
and so on, by adding them to the platforms definition in .kitchen.yml:
platforms:
- name: centos-6.4
You find Test Kitchen's log files inside your cookbook in the 
.kitchen/logs directory.
If you defined multiple platforms but want to run a Test Kitchen command against only one 
of them, you can add a regular expression matching the desired platform to your command: 
kitchen test default-ubuntu-14.04 or kitchen test 14.
If you want to know the status of the various VMs managed by Test Kitchen, you can list 
them as follows:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_cookbook $ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1404  Vagrant  ChefSolo     Converged

Showing affected nodes before uploading 
cookbooks
You know how it goes. You tweak a cookbook to support your new server and upload it to 
your Chef server. Your new node converges just fine and you're happy. Well, until your older 
production server picks up your modified cookbook during an automated Chef client run and 
spits its guts at you. Obviously, you forgot that your old production server was still using the 
cookbook you tweaked. Luckily, there is the knife preflight command, which can show 
you all the nodes using a certain cookbook before you upload it to your Chef server.
Getting ready
For the following example, we assume that you have at least one role using the ntp cookbook 
in its run list and that you have multiple servers with this role and/or the ntp cookbook in 
their run list directly.
Use Chef to install the knife-preflight gem:

your_app_role
Found 6 nodes and 3 roles using the specified search 
  criteria
How it works...
There are multiple ways for a cookbook to get executed on a node:
f
f
You can assign the cookbook directly to a node by adding it to the node's run list
f
f
You can add a cookbook to a role and add the role to the node's run list
f
f
You can add a role to the run list of another role and add that other role to the 
node's run list
f
f
A cookbook can be a dependency of another used cookbook and many more
No matter how a cookbook ended up in a node's run list, the knife preflight command 
will catch it because Chef stores all expanded lists of roles and recipes in node attributes. The 
knife preflight command issues a search for exactly those node attributes.
Eventually, the knife preflight command is a nicer way to run knife search node 
recipes:ntp -a name and knife search node roles:ntp -a name.
When using the knife preflight command (or trying to search for 
the recipes and roles attributes of a node), it is important to be 
aware of the fact that those attributes are only filled after a Chef client 
runs. If you change anything in your run lists but do not run the Chef 
client, neither knife preflight nor knife search will pick up 
your changes.

Overriding a node's run list to execute a 
single recipe
We all have those snowflake environments that are built using Chef, but we're not comfortable 
with running the Chef client anymore. We know that some cookbooks have been enhanced 
but never tested against this specific environment. The risk of bringing it down by a Chef 
client run is pretty high.

Chapter 2

However, even though we do not dare do a full Chef client run, we might need to run, for 
example, the users cookbook, in order to add a new colleague to our snowflake environment. 
This is where Chef client's feature to override a run list to execute a single recipe comes in 
very handy.
Don't overuse this feature! Make sure you fix your environment so that 
you're comfortable to run Chef client whenever you need to!
Getting ready
To follow along with the following example, you'll need a node hooked up to your Chef server 
having multiple recipes and/or roles in its run list.
How to do it...
Let's see how to run a single recipe out of a bigger run list on your node:
1.	 Show the data for your node. In this example, my node has the role base in its run 
list. Depending on your setup, you'll find other data here:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node show www.example.com
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
Run List:    role[base]
Roles:       base
Recipes:     chef-client::delete_validation, runit, chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
2.	 Run chef-client, overriding its run list. In our example, we want to run the default 
recipe of the users cookbook. Please replace recipe[users] with whatever you 
want to run on your node:
user@server:~$ chef-client -o 'recipe[users]'
Starting Chef Client, version 12.0.3

How it works...
Usually, the node uses the run list stored on the Chef server. The -o parameter simply ignores 
the node's run list and uses whatever the value of the -o parameter is as the run list for the 
current Chef run. It will not persist the passed run list. The next Chef client run (without 
the -o parameter) will use the run list stored on the Chef server again.

Using why-run mode to find out what a 
recipe might do
why-run mode lets each resource tell you what it would do during a Chef client run, 
assuming certain prerequisites. This is great because it gives you a glimpse about what 
might really happen on your node when you run your recipe for real.
However, because Chef converges a lot of resources to a desired state, why-run will never 
be accurate for a complete run. Nevertheless, it might help you during development while 
you're adding resources step-by-step to build the final recipe.
In this section, we'll try out why-run mode to see what it tells us about our Chef client runs.
Getting ready
To try out why-run mode, you need a node where you can execute the Chef client and at 
least one cookbook that is available on that node.
How to do it...
Let's try to run the ntp cookbook in why-run mode:
1.	 Override the current run list to run the ntp recipe in why-run mode on a brand 
new box:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client -o 'recipe[ntp]' --why-run

How it works...
The why-run mode is the no-operations mode for the Chef client. Instead of providers 
modifying the system, it tries to tell what the Chef run would attempt to do.
It's important to know that why-run makes certain assumptions; if it cannot find the command 
needed to find out about the current status of a certain service, it assumes that an earlier 
resource would have installed the needed package for that service and that therefore, the 
service would be started. We see this when the ntp cookbook tries to enable the ntp service:
    * Service status not available. Assuming a prior action would 
      have installed the service.
    * Assuming status of not running.
    * Could not find /etc/init/ntp.conf. Assuming service is disabled.
    - Would enable service service[ntp]
Additionally, why-run shows diffs of modified files. In our example, those differences show 
the whole files, as they do not exist yet. This feature is more helpful if you already have ntp 
installed and your next Chef run would only change a few configuration parameters.
why-run mode will execute the not_if and only_if blocks. It is 
assumed that the code within the not_if and only_if blocks will 
not modify the system but only do some checks.

Debugging Chef client runs
Sometimes you get obscure error messages when running the Chef client and you have a hard 
time finding any clue about where to look for the error. Is your cookbook broken? Do you have 
a networking issue? Is your Chef server down? Only by looking at the most verbose log output 
do you have a chance to find out.
Getting ready
You need a Chef client hooked up to the hosted Chef or your own Chef server.

How it works...
The -l option on the Chef-client run sets the log level to debug. In the debug log level, the Chef 
client shows more or less everything it does, including every request to the Chef server.
There's more...
The debug log level is the most verbose one. You're free to use debug, info, warn, error, 
or fatal with the -l switch.
You can configure the log level in your /etc/chef/client.rb file, using the log_level 
directive:
...
log_level :debug

Inspecting the results of your last Chef run
More often than we like to admit, Chef client runs fail. Especially when developing new 
cookbooks, we need to know what exactly went wrong.
Even though Chef prints all the details to stdout, you might want to look at it again, 
for example, after clearing your shell window.
Getting ready
You need to have a broken cookbook in your node's run list.

Raising and logging exceptions in recipes
Running your own cookbooks on your nodes might lead into situations where it does not make 
any sense to continue the current Chef run. If a critical resource is offline or a mandatory 
configuration value cannot be determined, it is time to bail out.
However, even if things are not that bad, you might want to log certain events while executing 
your recipes. Chef offers the possibility to write your custom log messages and exit the current 
run, if you choose to do so.
In this section, you'll learn how to add log statements and stop Chef runs using exceptions.
Getting ready
You need to have at least one cookbook you can modify and run on a node. The following 
example will use the ntp cookbook.
How to do it...
Let's see how to add our custom log message to a recipe:
1.	 Add log statements to the ntp cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/ntp/recipes/default.rb

service node['ntp']['service'] do
  supports :status => true, :restart => true
  action [ :enable, :start ]
end
Chef::Log.info('** ntp service installed and started 
  successfully!')
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload ntp
Uploading ntp            [1.7.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
3.	 Run the Chef client on the node:

How it works...
The fatal!(msg) method logs the given error message through Chef::Log.fatal(msg)

There's more...
You might want to exit the Chef client run without logging a fatal message. You can do so by 
using the exit!(msg) method in your recipe. It will log the given message as debug and exit 
the Chef client, the same as  it does when calling fatal!(...).

Diff-ing cookbooks with knife
When working with a Chef server, you often need to know what exactly is already uploaded 
to it. You edit files like recipes or roles locally, and commit and push them to GitHub.
However, before you're ready to upload your edits to the Chef server, you want to verify your 
changes. To do this, you need to run a diff between the local version of your files against 
the version already uploaded to the Chef server.
Getting ready
You need to have at least one cookbook you can modify and which is uploaded to your 
Chef server.
How to do it...
After changing a recipe, you can diff it against the current version stored on the Chef server.
Let knife show you the differences between your local version of my_cookbook and the 
version stored on the Chef server, by running:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife diff cookbooks/my_cookbook

How it works...
The diff verb for knife treats the Chef server like a file server mirroring your local file system. 
This way, you can run diffs by comparing your local files against files stored on the Chef server.
There's more...
If you want to show diffs of multiple cookbooks at once, you can use wildcards when running 
knife diff:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife diff cookbooks/*
diff --knife remote/cookbooks/backup_gem/recipes/default.rb 
  cookbooks/backup_gem/recipes/default.rb
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
diff --knife remote/cookbooks/backup_gem/metadata.rb 
  cookbooks/backup_gem/metadata.rb
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
You can limit knife diff to only list files, which have been changed instead of the full diff:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife diff --name-status cookbooks/my_cookbook
M    cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
The M indicates that the file cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb is modified.

Using community exception and report 
handlers
When running your Chef client as a daemon on your nodes, you usually have no idea whether 
everything works as expected. Chef comes with a feature named Handler, which helps you 
to find out what's going on during your Chef client runs.
There are a host of community handlers available, for example, to report Chef client run 
results to IRC, via email, to Campfire, Nagios, or Graphite. You name it.
In this section, we'll see how to install an IRC handler as an example. The same method is 
applicable to all other available handlers.
For a full list of available community handlers, go to http://docs.
chef.io/community_plugin_report_handler.html
Getting ready
In order to install community exception and report handlers, you need to add the 
chef_handler cookbook to your Berksfile first:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'chef_handler'
How to do it...
Let's see how to install and use one of the community handlers:
1.	 Create your own cookbook to install community exception and report handlers:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef generate cookbook cookbooks/my_
handlers
Compiling Cookbooks...
Recipe: code_generator::cookbook
  * directory[/Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/my_handlers]

2.	 Make your my_handlers cookbook aware of the fact that it needs the 
chef_handler cookbook by adding the dependency to its metadata:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_handlers/metadata.rb
depends 'chef_handler'
3.	 Add the IRC handler to your my_handlers cookbook (make sure you use your 
own URI for the irc_uri argument):
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_handlers/recipes/default.rb
include_recipe 'chef_handler'
chef_gem "chef-irc-snitch"
chef_handler 'IRCSnitch' do
  source File.join(Gem::Specification.find{|s| s.name == 
    'chef-irc-snitch'}.gem_dir,
    'lib', 'chef-irc-snitch.rb')
  arguments :irc_uri => "irc://nick:password@irc.example.
com:6667/#admins"
  action :enable
end
4.	 Upload your my_handlers cookbook to your Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_handlers
Uploading my_handlers    [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
5.	 Run the Chef client on your node to install your handlers:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client -o recipe[my_handlers]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * chef_handler[IRCSnitch] action enable

Evaluating and Troubleshooting Cookbooks and Chef Runs
78
How it works...
The chef_handler Light Weight Resource Provider (LWRP) provided by the chef_handler 
cookbook helps you enable and configure any custom handler without the need to manually 
modify client.rb on all your nodes.
Typically, you would install the desired community handler as a gem. You do this using the 
chef_gem resource.
You can pass an attributes Hash to the Handler class and you need to tell the LWRP where 
it can find the Handler class. The default should be chef/handlers/... but more often 
than not, this is not the case. We will search through all our installed Ruby gems to find the 
right one and append the path to the .rb file, where the Handler class is defined.
The LWRP will take care of enabling the handler, if you tell it to do so by using enable true.
There's more...
If you want, you can install your handler manually by editing client.rb on your nodes.
If your desired handler is not available as a Ruby gem, you can install it in /var/chef/
handlers and use this directory as the source when using the chef_handler LWRP.

Creating custom handlers
Chef handlers can be very helpful to integrate Chef with your tool chain. If there is no handler 
readily available for the tools you are using, it's pretty simple to write your own.
We'll have a look at how to create an exception handler, reporting Chef client run failures to 
Flowdock, a web-based team inbox and chat tool.
Getting ready...
As we want to publish information to a Flowdock inbox, you need to sign up for an account at 
http://www.flowdock.com. Also, we need to install the API client as a Ruby gem in order 
to be able to post to our team inbox from Chef.

mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef gem install flowdock
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Fetching: flowdock-0.5.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed flowdock-0.5.0
2 gems installed
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a custom handler to post Chef run failures to Flowdock:
1.	 Create your handler class:
mma@laptop:~/work/chef-handler-flowdock $ mkdir -p 
  lib/chef/handler
mma@laptop:~/work/chef-handler-flowdock $ subl 
  lib/chef/handler/flowdock_handler.rb
require 'chef/handler'
require 'flowdock'
class Chef
  class Handler
    class FlowdockHandler < Chef::Handler
      def initialize(options = {})
        @from = options[:from] || nil
        @flow = Flowdock::Flow.new(:api_token => 
          options[:api_token],
          :source => options[:source] || "Chef client")
      end
      def report
        if run_status.failed?
          content = "Chef client raised an exception:<br/>"
          content << run_status.formatted_exception
          content << "<br/>"
          content << run_status.backtrace.join("<br/>")
          @from = {:name => "root", :address => 
            "root@#{run_status.node.fqdn}"} if @from.nil?
          @flow.push_to_team_inbox(:subject => "Chef client 
            run on #{run_status.node} failed!",

            :content => content,
            :tags => ["chef", 
              run_status.node.chef_environment, 
              run_status.node.name], :from => @from)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
2.	 Copy the handler to your node:
user@server:~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/chef/handlers
mma@laptop:~/work/chef-handler-flowdock $ scp 
  lib/chef/handler/flowdock_handler.rb 
  user@server:/var/chef/handlers/flowdock_handler.rb
3.	 Enable the handler in client.rb on your node. Replace FLOWDOCK_API_TOKEN 
with your own token:
user@server:~$ subl /etc/chef/client.rb
require '/var/chef/handlers/flowdock_handler'
exception_handlers << 
  Chef::Handler::FlowdockHandler.new(:api_token => 
  "FLOWDOCK_API_TOKEN")
If you have a failing Chef client run on your node, your handler will report it to your 
Flowdock flow.
How it works...
To create a Chef handler, your class needs to extend Chef::Handler. It should have two 
methods: initialize and report. Chef will call the report method at the end of every 
Chef client run.
The handler class can access run_status of the Chef client run to retrieve information 
about the run, for example, the current node object, success? or failed?, and the 
exception (if any). You will find a full list of the supported attributes at http://docs.chef.
io/handlers.html#run-status-object
As we only want to report exceptions, we will execute our logic inside the report method only 
if the Chef run fails

There's more...
Instead of manually installing the handler on all your nodes, you can create a cookbook called 
my_handlers to do it for you (see the Using community exception and report handlers recipe 
in this chapter). The default recipe of your my_handlers cookbook should look like this:
include_recipe "chef_handler"
chef_gem "flowdock"
remote_file "#{node["chef_handler"]["handler_path"]}/flowdock_handler.
rb" do
  source "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmarschall/chef-handler-
flowdock/master/lib/chef/handler/flowdock_handler.rb"
end
chef_handler "Chef::Handler::FlowdockHandler" do
  source "#{node["chef_handler"]["handler_path"]}/flowdock_handler.rb"
  arguments :api_token =>  "FLOWDOCK_API_TOKEN"
  action :enable
end
In our example, we create the Flowdock API client in the initialize method. If you use the 
LWRP to install the handler, the initialize method will receive an options Hash from the 
arguments call inside the chef_handler provider.

Introduction
If you want to automate your infrastructure, you will end up using most of Chef's language 
features. In this chapter, we will take a look at how to use the Chef Domain Specific 
Language (DSL) from basic to advanced level. We will end the chapter with creating 
custom plugins for Ohai and knife.
Using community Chef style
It's easier to read code that adheres to a coding style guide. It is really important to deliver 
consistently styled code, especially when sharing cookbooks with the Chef community. In this 
chapter, you'll find some of the most important rules (out of many more—enough to fill a short 
book on its own) to apply to your own cookbooks.
Getting ready
As you're writing cookbooks in Ruby, it's a good idea to follow general Ruby principles for 
readable (and therefore maintainable) code.
Chef Software, Inc. is used to propose Ian Macdonald's Ruby Style Guide (http://www.
caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml#style), but to be honest, I prefer Bozhidar 
Batsov's Ruby Style Guide (https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) due 
to its clarity.
Let's take a look at the most important rules for Ruby in general and for cookbooks specifically.
How to do it...
Let's walk through a few Chef styling guideline examples:
1.	 Use two spaces per indentation level:
remote_directory node['nagios']['plugin_dir'] do
  source 'plugins'
end
2.	 Use Unix-style line endings. Avoid Windows line endings by configuring Git accordingly:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
For more options on how to deal with line endings in Git, go to https://
help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings.

Chapter 3
85
3.	 Align parameters spanning more than one line:
variables(
  mon_host: 'monitoring.example.com',
  nrpe_directory: "#{node['nagios']['nrpe']['conf_dir']}/nrpe.d"
)
4.	 Describe your cookbook in metadata.rb (you should always use the Ruby DSL 
as the JSON version will be automatically generated from it).
5.	 Configure your cookbook to the appropriate version by using Semantic Versioning 
(http://semver.org):
version           "1.1.0"
6.	 List the supported operating systems looping through an array by using 
each parameter:
%w(redhat centos ubuntu debian).each do |os|
  supports os
end
7.	
Declare dependencies in metadata.rb:
depends "apache2", ">= 1.0.4"
depends "build-essential"
8.	 Construct strings from variable values and static parts by using string expansion:
my_string = "This resource changed #{counter} files"
9.	 Download temporary files to Chef::Config['file_cache_path'] instead 
of /tmp or some local directory.
10.	 Use strings to access node attributes instead of Ruby symbols:
node['nagios']['users_databag_group']
11.	 Set attributes in my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb by using default:
default['my_cookbook']['version']     = "3.0.11"
12.	Create an attribute namespace by using your cookbook name as the first level 
in my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb:
default['my_cookbook']['version']     = "3.0.11"
default['my_cookbook']['name']        = "Mine"
How it works...
Using community Chef style helps to increase the readability of your cookbooks. Your 
cookbooks will be read much more often than changed. Because of this, it usually pays 
off to put a little extra effort into following a strict style guide when writing cookbooks.

There's more...
Using Semantic Versioning (see: http://semver.org) for your cookbooks helps to 
manage dependencies. If you change anything that might break cookbooks, depending 
on your cookbook, you need to consider this as a backwards incompatible API change. 
In such cases, Semantic Versioning demands that you increase the major number of your 
cookbook, for example from 1.1.3 to 2.0.0, resetting minor level and patch levels.
Using Semantic Versioning helps to keep your production systems stable if you freeze your 
cookbooks (see the Freezing cookbooks recipe in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure).

If you want to know whether you did everything right, follow the Flagging problems in 
your Chef cookbooks recipe in Chapter 2, Evaluating and Troubleshooting Cookbooks 
and Chef Runs.
Using attributes to dynamically configure 
recipes
Imagine some cookbook author has hardcoded the path where the cookbook puts a 
configuration file—but in a place that does not comply with your rules. Now, you're in trouble! 
You can either patch the cookbook or rewrite it from scratch. Both options leave you with a 
lot of work and headaches.
Attributes are there to avoid such headaches. Instead of hardcoding values inside cookbooks, 
attributes enable authors to make their cookbooks configurable. By overriding default values 
set in cookbooks, users can inject their own values. Suddenly, it's next to trivial to obey your 
own rules.
In this section, we'll see how to use attributes in your cookbooks.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.

Chapter 3
87
How to do it...
Let's see how to define and use a simple attribute:
1.	 Create a default file for your cookbook attributes:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/
default.rb
2.	 Add a default attribute:
default['my_cookbook']['message'] = 'hello world!'
3.	 Use the attribute inside a recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
message = node['my_cookbook']['message']
Chef::Log.info("** Saying what I was told to say: #{message}")
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server (use --force or bump the version 
number in your metadata.rb file if Berkshelf has frozen your cookbook earlier):
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook --force
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
5.	 Run Chef-client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-13T20:48:21+00:00] INFO: ** Saying what I was told to 
say: hello world!
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
Chef loads all attributes from the attribute files before it executes the recipes. The attributes 
are stored with the node object. You can access all attributes stored with the node object from 
within your recipes and retrieve their current values.
Chef has a strict order of precedence for attributes: default being the lowest, then comes 
normal (which is aliased with set), and then override. Additionally, attribute levels set in 
recipes have precedence over the same level set in an attribute file. Also, attributes defined 
in roles and environments have the highest precedence.

Chef Language and Style
88
There's more...
You can set and override attributes within roles and environments, as well. Attributes defined 
in roles or environments have the highest precedence (on their respective levels: default 
and override):
1.	 Create a role:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/german_hosts.rb
name "german_hosts"
description "This Role contains hosts, which should print out 
their messages in German"
run_list "recipe[my_cookbook]"
default_attributes "my_cookbook" => { "message" => "Hallo Welt!" }
2.	 Upload the role to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file german_hosts.rb
Updated Role german_hosts!
3.	 Assign the role to a node called server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server 
'role[german_hosts]'
server:
  run_list: role[german_hosts]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-13T20:49:49+00:00] INFO: ** Saying what I was told to 
say: Hallo Welt!
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Calculating values in the attribute files
Attributes set in roles and environments (as shown earlier) have the highest precedence 
and they're already available when the attribute files get loaded. This enables you to 
calculate attribute values based on role or environment-specific values:
1.	 Set an attribute within a role:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/german_hosts.rb
name "german_hosts"

their messages in German"
run_list "recipe[my_cookbook]"
default_attributes "my_cookbook" => {
  "hi" => "Hallo",
  "world" => "Welt"
}
2.	 Calculate the message attribute, based on the two attributes hi and world:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/
default.rb
default['my_cookbook']['message'] = "#{node['my_cookbook']['hi']} 
#{node['my_cookbook']['world']}!"
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to your Chef server and run the Chef client on your 
node to see that it works, as shown in the preceding example.

Using templates
Configuration Management is all about configuring your hosts well. Usually, configuration 
is carried out by using configuration files. Chef's template resource allows you to recreate 
these configuration files with dynamic values that are driven by the attributes we discussed 
so far in this chapter.
You can retrieve dynamic values from data bags, attributes, or even calculate them on the 
fly before passing them into a template.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in Creating and using cookbooks recipe in Chapter 1, 
Chef Infrastructure.

How to do it...
Let's see how to create and use a template to dynamically generate a file on your node:
1.	 Add a template to your recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
template '/tmp/message' do
  source 'message.erb'
  variables(
    hi: 'Hallo',
    world: 'Welt',
    from: node['fqdn']
  )
end
2.	 Add the ERB template file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/message.erb
<%- 4.times do %>
<%= @hi %>, <%= @world %> from <%= @from %>!
<%- end %>
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-14T20:41:21+00:00] INFO: Processing template[/tmp/
message] action create (my_cookbook::default line 9)
[2015-01-14T20:41:22+00:00] INFO: template[/tmp/message] updated 
content
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
user@server:~$ sudo cat /tmp/message

Hallo, Welt from vagrant.vm!
Hallo, Welt from vagrant.vm!
How it works...
Chef uses Erubis as its template language. It allows you to use pure Ruby code by using 
special symbols inside your templates.
You use <%= %> if you want to print the value of a variable or Ruby expression into the 
generated file.
You use <%- %> if you want to embed Ruby logic into your template file. We used it 
to loop our expression four times.
When you use the template resource, Chef makes all the variables you pass available as 
instance variables when rendering the template. We used @hi, @world, and @from in our 
earlier example.
There's more...
The node object is available in a template as well. Technically, you could access node 
attributes directly from within your template:
<%= node['fqdn'] %>
However, this is not a good idea because it will introduce hidden dependencies to your 
template. It is better to make dependencies explicit, for example, by declaring the fully 
qualified domain name (FQDN) of your node as a variable for the template resource 
inside your cookbook:
template '/tmp/fqdn' do
  source 'fqdn.erb'
  variables(
    fqdn:node['fqdn']
  )
end
Avoid using the node object directly inside your templates because this 
introduces hidden dependencies to node variables in your templates.
If you need a different template for a specific host or platform, you can put those specific 
templates into various subdirectories of the templates directory. Chef will try to locate 
the correct template by searching these directories from the most specific (host) to least 
specific(default).

92
You can place message.erb in the cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/host-
server.vm ("host-#{node[:fqdn]}") directory it should be specific to that host. 
It should be specific to a certain platform version. You can place it in cookbooks/my_
cookbook/templates/ubuntu-14.04 ("#{node[:platform]}-#{node[:platorm_
version]}"), and if it is only be platform-specific, you can place it in cookbooks/my_
cookbook/templates/ubuntu ("#{node[:platform]}"). Only if your template is 
the same for any host or platform, you will place it in the default directory.
Be aware of the fact that the templates/default directory means 
that a template file is the same for all hosts and platforms—it does not 
correspond to a recipe name.

Mixing plain Ruby with Chef DSL
To create simple recipes, you only need to use resources provided by Chef such as template, 
remote_file, or service. However, as your recipes become more elaborate, you'll discover 
the need to do more advanced things such as conditionally execute parts of your recipe, 
looping, or even complex calculations.
Instead of declaring the gem_package resource ten times, simply use different name 
attributes; it is so much easier to loop through an array of gem names creating the 
gem_package resources on the fly.
This is the power of mixing plain Ruby with Chef Domain Specific Language (DSL). 
We'll see a few tricks in the following sections.
Getting ready
Start a Chef-shell on any of your nodes in Client mode to be able to access your Chef 
server, as shown in the following code:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-shell --client
loading configuration: /etc/chef/client.rb
Session type: client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
run `help' for help, `exit' or ^D to quit.

Chapter 3
93
How to do it...
Let's play around with some Ruby constructs in chef-shell to get a feel for what's possible:
1.	 Get all nodes from the Chef server by using search from the Chef DSL:
chef > nodes = search(:node, "hostname:[* TO *]")
=> [#<Chef::Node:0x00000005010d38 @chef_server_rest=nil, @
name="server",
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
2.	 Sort your nodes by name by using plain Ruby:
chef > nodes.sort! { |a, b| a.hostname <=> b.hostname }.collect { 
|n| n.hostname }
 => ["alice", "server"]
3.	 Loop through the nodes, printing their operating systems:
chef > nodes.each do |n|
chef > puts n['os']
chef ?> end
linux
windows
 => [node[server], node[alice]]
4.	 Log only if there are no nodes:
chef > Chef::Log.warn("No nodes found") if nodes.empty?
=> nil
5.	 Install multiple Ruby gems by using an array, a loop, and string expansion to construct 
the gem names:
chef > recipe_mode
chef:recipe > %w{ec2 essentials}.each do |gem|
chef:recipe > gem_package "knife-#{gem}"
chef:recipe ?> end
=> ["ec2", "essentials"]
How it works...
Chef recipes are Ruby files, which get evaluated in the context of a Chef run. They can contain 
plain Ruby code, such as if statements and loops, as well as Chef DSL elements such as 
resources (remote_file, service, template, and so on).
Inside your recipes, you can declare Ruby variables and assign them any values. We used the 
Chef DSL method search to retrieve an array of Chef::Node instances and stored that array 
in the variable nodes.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chef Language and Style
94
Because nodes is a plain Ruby array, we can use all methods the array class provides such 
as sort! or empty?
Also, we can iterate through the array by using the plain Ruby each iterator, as we did in the 
third example earlier.
Another common thing is to use if, else, or case for conditional execution. In the fourth 
example earlier, we used if to only write a warning to the log file, if the nodes array would 
be empty.
In the last example, we entered recipe mode and combined an array of strings (holding parts 
of gem names) and the each iterator with the Chef DSL gem_package resource to install two 
Ruby gems. To take things one step further, we used plain Ruby string expansion to construct 
the full gem names (knife-ec2 and knife-essentials) on the fly.
There's more...
You can use the full power of Ruby in combination with the Chef DSL in your recipes. Here is 
an excerpt from the default recipe from the nagios cookbook, which shows what's possible:
# Sort by name to provide stable ordering
nodes.sort! { |a, b| a.name <=> b.name }
# maps nodes into nagios hostgroups
service_hosts = {}
search(:role, ‚*:*') do |r|
  hostgroups << r.name
  nodes.select { |n| n[‚roles'].include?(r.name) if n[‚roles'] }.each 
do |n|
    service_hosts[r.name] = n[node[‚nagios'][‚host_name_attribute']]
  end
end
First, they use Ruby to sort an array of nodes by their name attributes.
Then, they define a Ruby variable called service_hosts as an empty Hash. After this, 
you will see some more array methods in action such as select, include?, and each.

Installing Ruby gems and using them in 
recipes
Recipes are plain Ruby files. It is possible to use all of Ruby's language features inside 
your recipes. Most of the time, the built-in Ruby functionality is enough but sometimes you 
might want to use additional Ruby gems. Connecting to an external application via an API or 
accessing a MySQL database from within your recipe is an example of where you will need 
Ruby gems inside your recipes.
Chef lets you install Ruby gems from within a recipe, so that you can use them later.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how we can use the ipaddress gem in our recipe:
1.	 Edit the default recipe of your cookbook, installing a gem to be used inside 
the recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl
     cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
     chef_gem 'ipaddress'
     require 'ipaddress'
     ip = IPAddress("192.168.0.1/24")
     Chef::Log.info("Netmask of #{ip}: #{ip.netmask}")
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
     Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
3.	 Run Chef client on your node to see whether it works:
user@server $ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2014-12-29T22:29:15+01:00] INFO: Netmask of 192.168.0.1:

How it works...
A Chef run consists of a compile phase, where it instantiates all resources, and an execute 
phase, where Chef runs the resource providers to converge the node.
If you want to use the functionality of a Ruby gem inside your cookbook, you need to install 
that gem during the compile phase. Otherwise, it will not be available during the execute 
phase (only after the Chef run).
The chef_gem resource will do exactly that.
The gem_package resource, in contrast, installs the gem into the system Ruby. It does that 
during the execute phase of the Chef run. This means that gems installed by gem_package 
cannot be used inside your recipes.

Using libraries
You can use arbitrary Ruby code within your recipes. As long as your logic isn't too 
complicated, it's totally fine to keep it inside your recipe. However, as soon as you start 
using plain Ruby more than Chef DSL, it's time to the move logic into external libraries.
Libraries provide a place to encapsulate Ruby code so that your recipes stay clean and neat.
In this section, we'll create a simple library to see how this works.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in Creating and using cookbooks recipe of 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's create a library and use it in a cookbook:
1.	 Create a helper method in your own cookbook's library:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p cookbooks/my_cookbook/libraries
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/libraries/
ipaddress.rb
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 3
97
class Chef::Recipe
  def netmask(ipaddress)
    IPAddress(ipaddress).netmask
  end
end
2.	 Use your helper method in a recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
ip = '10.10.0.0/24'
mask = netmask(ip) # here we use the library method
Chef::Log.info("Netmask of #{ip}: #{mask}")
3.	 Run the Chef client on your development box to see whether it works:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef-client -z -o 'recipe[my_cookbook]'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2014-12-30T21:17:44+01:00] INFO: Netmask of 10.10.0.0/24: 
255.255.255.0
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
In your Library code, you can open the Chef::Recipe class and add your new methods.
This isn't the cleanest, but it is the simplest way of doing it. The following 
paragraphs will help you find a cleaner way.
class Chef::Recipe
  def netmask(ipaddress)
    ...
  end
end
Chef automatically loads your library code in the compile phase that enables you to use the 
methods that you declare inside your recipes of the cookbook:
mask = netmask(ip)

There's more...
Opening a class and adding methods pollutes the class's namespace. This might lead to 
name clashes, for example, if you define a method inside a library of your own cookbook 
and someone else defines a method with the same name in the library of another cookbook. 
Another clash would happen if you accidentally use a method name, which Chef defines in 
its Chef::Recipe class.
It's cleaner to introduce your subclasses inside your libraries and define your methods as 
class methods. This avoids polluting the Chef::Recipe namespace are given:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/libraries/ipaddress.
rb
    class Chef::Recipe::IPAddress
      def self.netmask(ipaddress)
        IPAddress(ipaddress).netmask
      end
    end
You can use the method inside your recipes like this:
IPAddress.netmask(ip)
You can define library methods in chef-shell directly in the root context:
user@server $ chef-shell --client
chef > class Chef::Recipe::IPAddress
chef ?> def self.netmask(ipaddress)
chef ?>     IPAddress(ipaddress).netmask
chef ?>   end
chef ?> end
Now, you can use the library method inside the recipe context:
chef > recipe
chef:recipe > IPAddress.netmask('10.10.0.0/24')
 => "255.255.255.0"

Using definitions
Your cookbooks will grow and get pretty long. Silently, some duplication will sneak in, as 
well. It's time to group resources and give them names in order to regain readability for your 
cookbook. Also, if you use the same set of resources again and again, it is a good idea to 
refactor such groups of resources into definitions.
In this section, we'll group a set of resources into a definition to make it reusable.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list file of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in Creating and using cookbooks recipe of 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how to create and use a definition:
1.	 Create a definition in a new file in your cookbook's definitions folder:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p cookbooks/my_cookbook/
definitions
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/definitions/
capistrano_deploy_dirs.rb
define :capistrano_deploy_dirs, :deploy_to => '' do
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/releases"
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/shared"
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/shared/system"
end
2.	 Use the definition inside your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
capistrano_deploy_dirs do
  deploy_to "/srv"
end
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]

4.	 Run the Chef client on your node to see whether it works:
user@server $ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * directory[/srv/releases] action create[2014-12-
30T16:23:57+00:00] INFO: directory[/srv/releases] created 
directory /srv/releases
    - create new directory /srv/releases
  * directory[/srv/shared] action create[2014-12-
30T16:23:57+00:00] INFO: directory[/srv/shared] created directory 
/srv/shared
    - create new directory /srv/shared
  * directory[/srv/shared/system] action create[2014-12-
30T16:23:57+00:00] INFO: directory[/srv/shared/system] created 
directory /srv/shared/system
    - create new directory /srv/shared/system
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
Definitions in Chef are like macros: you group a collection of resources and give this group 
a name. Chef reads the definition and expands its contents into the recipe during the 
compile phase.
A definition has a name (here, capistrano_deploy_dirs) by which you can call it from 
your recipe. Also, a definition has a list of parameters (here deploy_to):
define :capistrano_deploy_dirs, :deploy_to => '' do
  ...
end
The code inside the definition has access to a Hash called params. It contains all the keys 
you defined after the definition name. Here, Chef will add the three directory resources 
to the execution list:
define ...
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/releases"
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/shared"
  directory "#{params[:deploy_to]}/shared/system"
end

Chapter 3
101
In your recipes, you can use the definition name instead of putting all the three directory 
resources. Inside the block, you use dynamically generated methods to fill each parameter 
with its value:
capistrano_deploy_dirs do
  deploy_to "/srv"
end
There's more...
Be aware that definitions are expanded into their containing resources during the compile 
phase of the Chef run. Definitions are not available during the execution phase. You cannot 
notify a definition, but only the resources it contains.
You cannot address the definition:
notifies :delete, 'capsitrano_deploy_dirs', :immediately
However, you can address the individual resources inside the definition:
notifies :delete, 'directory[/srv/releases], :immediately

Creating your own Lightweight Resource 
Providers (LWRP)
Chef offers the opportunity to extend the list of available resources by creating a custom 
Lightweight Resource Provider (LWRP). By creating your own custom resources, you can 
simplify writing cookbooks because your own custom resources enrich the Chef DSL and 
make your recipe code more expressive.
Many of the custom resources in Chef's community cookbooks (and elsewhere) are 
implemented as LWRPs. So, there are many working examples in the real world, such 
as iptables_rule, apt_repository, and many more.
In this section, we will create a very simple LWRP to demonstrate the basic mechanics.
Getting ready
Create a new cookbook named greeting and ensure that the run_list of your node 
includes greeting, as described in Creating and using cookbooks recipe of Chapter 1, 
Chef Infrastructure.

How to do it...
Let's see how to build a very simple LWRP to create a text file on your node:
1.	 Create your custom resource in your greeting cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/greeting/resources/
default.rb
actions :create, :remove
attribute :title, kind_of: String, default: "World"
attribute :path, kind_of: String, default: "/tmp/greeting.txt"
2.	 Create the provider for your resource in your greeting cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/greeting/providers/
default.rb
action :create do
  Chef::Log.info "Adding '#{new_resource.name}' greeting as #{new_
resource.path}"
  file new_resource.path do
    content "#{new_resource.name}, #{new_resource.title}!"
    action :create
  end
end
action :remove do
  Chef::Log.info "Removing '#{new_resource.name}' greeting #{new_
resource.path}"
  file new_resource.path do
    action :delete
  end
end
3.	 Use your new resource by editing your greeting cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
cookbooks/greeting/recipes/default.rb
greeting "Ohai" do
  title "Chef"
  action :create
end
4.	 Run the Chef client on your workstation:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef-client -z -o 'recipe[greeting]'

5.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cat /tmp/greeting.txt
Ohai, Chef!
How it works...
LWRPs live in cookbooks. A custom resource, which you will define in a file called default.
rb in the resources directory of your cookbook, will be available under the cookbook name.
We create greeting/resources/default.rb and use it in our default recipe, as follows:
greeting "..." do
end
Let's see what the resource definition in greeting/resources/default.rb looks like.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chef Language and Style
104
First, we define the actions, which our resource should support:
actions :create, :remove
Then, we define attributes you can pass to the resource when using it in your cookbook. 
In our case, we define two string attributes with their default values:
attribute :title, kind_of: String, default: "World"
attribute :path, kind_of: String, default: "/tmp/greeting.txt"
Now, we can use those actions and attributes in our recipe:
greeting "Ohai" do
  title "Chef"
  action :create
end
We defined the resource, now it's time to make it do something. The implementation of 
a resource lives in one or many providers. You might find multiple providers for the same 
resource for different operating systems. However, we keep it simple here and create only 
one provider in greeting/providers/default.rb.
The provider has to implement each action defined in the resource. In our case, we need to 
implement two actions: create and remove, as shown in the following code:
action :create do
  ...
end
action :remove do
  ...
end
Now, you can use pure Ruby and the existing Chef resources to make your provider do 
something. First, we create a log statement and then we use the existing file resource 
to create a text file containing the greeting:
  Chef::Log.info "Adding '#{new_resource.name}' greeting as #{new_
resource.path}"
  file new_resource.path do
    ...
  end
The new_resource attribute is a Ruby variable containing the resource definition from 
the recipe that uses the resource. In our case, new_resource.name evaluates to Ohai 
and new_resource.path evaluates to the attributes default value (because we did not 
use that attribute when using the greeting resource in our cookbook).
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 3
105
Inside the file resource, we use our resource's title (new_resource.title) attribute 
to fill the text file:
file new_resource.path do
  content "#{new_resource.name}, #{new_resource.title}!"
  action :create
end
The remove action works in a similar way to the create action, but calls the file resource's 
delete action, instead.
There's more...
To simplify the usage of your custom resource, you can define a default action. You declare 
it using the default_action call:
default_action :create
Now you can use your new resource like this:
greeting "Ohai" do
  title "Chef"
end
If you're using plain Ruby code in your providers, you need to make sure 
that your code is idempotent. This means that it only runs if it has to modify 
something. You should be able to run your code multiple times on the same 
machine, without executing unnecessary actions on each run.
If you want your resource to support why-run mode, you need to add the following to it:
def whyrun_supported?
  true
end
Then, you can wrap your code with a converge_by block. This will produce the message 
you pass to it during why-run mode, instead of executing the code inside, as shown in the 
following code:
converge_by("Doing something with #{ @new_resource }") do
  ...

Extending community cookbooks by using 
application wrapper cookbooks
Using community cookbooks is great. However, sometimes they do not exactly match your 
use case. You may need to modify them. If you don't want to use Git vendor branches that 
are generated by knife cookbook site install, you need to use the library versus 
application cookbook approach.
In this approach, you don't touch the community (library) cookbook. Instead, you include 
it in your own application cookbook and modify resources from the library cookbook.
Let's see how to extend a community cookbook within your own application cookbook.
Getting ready
We'll use the ntp cookbook as the library cookbook and will change a command it executes.
Add the ntp cookbook to your Berksfile:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
source 'https://supermarket.getchef.com'
cookbook 'ntp'
How to do it...
Let's see how we can override the ntp cookbook's behavior from within our own cookbook:
1.	 Create your own application cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef generate cookbook my-ntp

  * directory[/Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/my-ntp] action 
create
    - create new directory /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks/my-
ntp
2.	 Add your new my-ntp cookbook to the run list of your node:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server 
'recipe[my-ntp]'
server:
  run_list:
  recipe[my-ntp]
3.	 Add the dependency on the ntp cookbook to the my-ntp metadata:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my-ntp/metadata.rb
version          '0.1.0'
...
depends 'ntp'
4.	 Make the default recipe from the ntp cookbook execute another command, which 
you defined in your own cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my-ntp/recipes/default.rb
...
include_recipe 'ntp::default'
node.override['ntp']['sync_hw_clock'] = true
resources("execute[Force sync hardware clock with system clock]").
command "hwclock --systohc -D"
5.	 Upload your cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my-ntp
Uploading my-ntp    [0.1.0]
6.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server $ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

Chef Language and Style
108
How it works...
We retrieve and modify the execute resource for the hwclock --systohc command from 
the ntp cookbook. First, we need to include the recipe, which defines the resource we want 
to modify the code:
include_recipe 'ntp::default'
The resources method retrieves the given resource. We can then call all the methods on 
it, which we could also call while defining it in a recipe. In our example, we want to tell the 
execute resource that we want to use a different command lines:
resources("execute[Force sync hardware clock with system clock]").
command "hwclock --systohc -D"
This modification of the resource happens during the compile phase. Only after Chef has 
evaluated the whole recipe, it will execute all the resources it built during the compile phase.
There's more...
If you don't want to modify the existing cookbooks, this is currently the only way to modify 
parts of recipes, which are not meant to be configured via attributes.
I don't like this approach too much. It is the exact same thing as monkey-patching any Ruby 
class by reopening it in your own source files. This usually leads to brittle code, as your code 
now depends on implementation details of another piece of code instead of depending on 
its public interface (in Chef recipes, the public interface is its attributes).
You should be aware of the fact that what you're doing is dangerous. Keep such cookbook 
modifications in a separate place so that you can easily find out what you did later. If you 
bury your modifications deep inside your complicated cookbooks, you might experience 
issues later that are very hard to debug.

Creating custom Ohai plugins
Ohai is the tool used by a Chef client to find out everything about the node's environment. 
During a Chef client run, Ohai plugin populates the node object with all the information it 
found about the node such as its operating system, hardware, and so on.

It is possible to write custom Ohai plugins to query additional properties about a 
node's environment.
Please note that Ohai data isn't populated until after a 
successful chef-client run!
In this example, we will see how to query the currently active firewall rules using iptables 
and make them available as node attributes.
Getting ready
Make sure you have iptables installed on your node. See the Managing firewalls with 
iptables recipe in Chapter 7, Servers and Cloud Infrastructure.
Make sure you have the chef-client cookbook available:
1.	 Add the chef-client cookbook to your Berksfile:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'chef-client'
2.	 Add the chef-client cookbook to your node's run list:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server 'chef-
client::config'
server:
  run_list:
    recipe[chef-client::config]
How to do it...
Let's write a simple Ohai plugin, which lists all the currently active iptables rules:
1.	 Install the ohai cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook site install ohai
Installing ohai to /Users/mma/work/chef-repo/cookbooks

2.	 Add your plugin to the ohai cookbook:

  provides "iptables"
  collect_data(:default) do
    iptables Mash.new
    `iptables -S`.each_line.with_index {|line, i| iptables[i] = 
line }
  end
end
3.	 Upload the modified ohai cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload ohai
Uploading ohai    [2.0.1]
4.	 Add the ohai cookbook to the run list of your node:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list add server ohai
server:
  run_list:
    recipe[chef-client::config]
    recipe[ohai]
5.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T21:21:55+00:00] INFO: ohai[custom_plugins] reloaded
    - re-run ohai and merge results into node attributes
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate that the iptables rules show up as node attributes, for example, 
by navigating to your Chef server's management console. The iptables 
rules should show up amongst the other node attributes:

Chapter 3
111
How it works...
The chef-client cookbook configures the Chef client to look for additional Ohai plugins in 
the /etc/chef/ohai_plugins directory by adding this line to /etc/chef/client.rb:
Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] << "/etc/chef/ohai_plugins"
You can simply install the ohai cookbook and add your Ohai plugins to the cookbooks/
ohai/files/default/plugins directory. The ohai cookbook will then upload your 
plugins to your node.
A custom Ohai plugin has only a few basic parts. First, you need to give it a Ruby class name:
 Ohai.plugin(:Iptables) do
end
Then, you need to define which attribute the plugin will populate:
provides "iptables"
The preceding code tells Ohai that the node attributes you fill will be available under the 
iptables key.
Inside a method called collect_data, you define what the plugin should do when it runs. 
The parameter :default says that this collect_data method runs on any platform.
You collect the node attributes in a Mash—an extended version of a Hash the code, as follows:
iptables Mash.new
The preceding line of code creates an empty node attribute.
Then, we run iptables -S to list all the currently loaded firewall rules and loop through 
the lines. Each line gets added to the Mash with its line number as the key:
`sudo iptables -S`.each_line.with_index {|line,i|
  iptables[i] = line }
Ohai will add the contents of that Mash as node attributes during a Chef client run. We can 
now use the new iptables node attribute in our recipes:
node['iptables']

There's more...
You can use your Ohai plugin as a library. This enables you to use the functionality of your 
Ohai plugins in arbitrary Ruby scripts. Fire up IRB in the /etc/chef/ohai_plugins 
directory and run the following command lines to make the iptables attributes accessible 
in the IRB session:
user@server:/etc/chef/ohai_plugins$ sudo /opt/chef/embedded/bin/irb
  >> require 'ohai'
  >> Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] << '.'
  >> o = Ohai::System.new
  >> o.all_plugins
  >> o['iptables']
=> {0=>"-P INPUT ACCEPT\n", 1=>"-P FORWARD ACCEPT\n", 2=>"-P OUTPUT 
ACCEPT\n"}

Creating custom knife plugins
Knife, the command-line client for the Chef server, has a plugin system. This plugin system 
enables us to extend the functionality of knife in any way we need it. The knife-ec2 plugin 
is a common example; it adds commands such as ec2 server create to knife.
In this section, we will create a very basic custom knife plugin to learn about all the 
required building blocks of knife plugins. As knife plugins are pure Ruby programs, which can 
use any external libraries, there are no limits for what you can make knife do. This freedom 
enables you to build your whole DevOps workflow on knife, if you want to.

Create an access token by connecting the application to your Twitter account. This will 
enable your Twitter application (and therefore your knife plugin) to tweet as your Twitter user.
Make sure you have the twitter gem installed. It will enable you to interact with Twitter 
from within your knife plugin:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef gem install twitter
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

How to do it...
Let's create a knife plugin so that we can tweet by using the following knife command:
$ knife tweet "having fun building knife plugins"
1.	 Create a directory for your knife plugin inside your Chef repository:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p .chef/plugins/knife
2.	 Create your knife plugin:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl .chef/plugins/knife/knife_twitter.rb
require 'chef/knife'
module KnifePlugins
  class Tweet < Chef::Knife
    deps do
      require 'twitter'
    end
    banner "knife tweet MESSAGE"
    def run
      client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do |config|

        config.access_token_secret = "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRECT>"
      end
      client.update("#{name_args.first} #getchef")
    end
  end
end
3.	 Send your first tweet:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife tweet "having fun with building 
knife plugins"
4.	 Validate whether the tweet went live:
How it works...
There are three ways to make your knife plugins available: in your home directory under 
~/.chef/plugins/knife (so that you can use them for all your Chef repositories), in your 
Chef repository under .chef/plugins/knife (so that every co-worker using that repository 
can use them), or as a Ruby gem (so that everyone in the Chef community can use them).
We chose the second way, so that everyone working on our Chef repository can check out 
and use our Twitter knife plugin.
First, we need to include Chef's knife library into our Ruby file in order to be able to create 
a knife plugin:
require 'chef/knife'
Then, we define our plugin as follows:
module KnifePlugins
  class Tweet < Chef::Knife
    ...
  end
end
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
115
The preceding code creates the new knife command tweet. The command is derived from 
the class name that we gave our plugin. Each knife plugin needs to extend Chef::Knife.
The next step is to load all the dependencies required. Instead of simply putting multiple 
require calls at the beginning of our Ruby file, knife provides the deps method (which 
we can override) to load dependencies lazily on demand:
    deps do
      require 'twitter'
    end
Placing require 'twitter' inside the deps method makes sure that the twitter gem 
will only get loaded if our plugin runs. Not doing so would mean that the twitter gem would 
get loaded on each knife run, no matter whether it would be used or not.
After defining the dependencies, we need to tell the users of our plugin what it does and 
how to use it. The knife plugin provides the banner method to define the message that 
users see when they call our plugin with the --help parameter:
    banner "knife tweet MESSAGE"
Let's see how this works:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife tweet --help
knife tweet MESSAGE
Finally, we need to actually do something. The run method is where to place the code we 
want to execute. In our case, we create a Twitter client passing our authentication credentials:
client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do |config|
...
end
Then, we send our tweet:
      client.update("#{name_args.first} #getchef")
The name_args attribute contains command-line arguments. We take the first one as the 
message that we send to Twitter and add the #getchef hashtag to every message we send.
There's more...
You can add simple error handling to make sure that the user doesn't send empty tweets 
by adding this block at the beginning of the run method:
run
  unless name_args.size == 1

Chef Language and Style
116
    ui.fatal "You need to say something!"
    show_usage
    exit 1
  end
...
end
This piece of code gets executed if there isn't exactly one command-line argument available 
to the knife tweet call. In that case, it will print the error message and a user will get the 
same message when using the --help parameter. Then, this block will exit with the error 
code 1, without doing anything else.

Introduction
In this chapter, we'll see some of the more advanced topics in action. You'll see how to 
make your recipes more flexible by using search and data bags, and how to make sure 
your cookbooks run on different operating systems. You'll gain critical knowledge to create 
extensible and maintainable cookbooks for your infrastructure.
Setting the environment variables
You might have experienced this: you try out a command on your node's shell and it works 
perfectly. Now, you try to execute the very same command from within your Chef recipe but it 
fails. One reason may be that there are certain environment variables set in your shell, which 
are not set during the Chef run. You might have set them manually or in your shell start up 
scripts—it does not really matter. You'll need to set them again in your recipe.
In this section, you will see how to set environment variables needed during a Chef run.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe 
in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how we can set environment variables from within Chef recipes:
1.	 Set an environment variable to be used during the Chef client run:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
ENV['MESSAGE'] = 'Hello from Chef'
execute 'print value of environment variable $MESSAGE' do
  command 'echo $MESSAGE > /tmp/message'
end
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook --force

Chapter 4
119
3.	 Run the Chef client to create the tmp file:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T22:46:30+01:00] INFO: execute[print value of 
environment variable $MESSAGE] ran successfully
    - execute echo $MESSAGE > /tmp/message
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Ensure that it worked:
user@server:~$ cat /tmp/message
Hello from Chef
How it works...
Ruby exposes the current environment via ENV—a hash to read or modify environment 
variables. We use ENV to set our environment variable. It is valid for the Ruby process in 
which the Chef client runs, as well as all child processes run.
The execute resource spawns a child process of the Ruby process by running the Chef client. 
Because it is a child process, the environment variable we set in the recipe is available to 
the script code the execute resource runs.
We simply access the environment variable by $MESSAGE, as we would do through the 
command line.
There's more...
The execute resource offers a way to pass environment variables to the command 
it executes.
1.	 Change the my_cookbook default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
execute 'print value of environment variable $MESSAGE' do
  command 'echo $MESSAGE > /tmp/message'
  environment 'MESSAGE' => 'Hello from the execute resource'
end
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to your Chef server and run the Chef client, as shown 
in the How to do it... section.

3.	 Validate the contents of the tmp file:
user@server:~$ cat /tmp/message
Hello from the execute resource
Setting an environment variable using ENV will make that variable available 
during the whole Chef run. In contrast, passing it to the execute resource will 
only make it available for that one command executed by the resource.

Passing arguments to shell commands
The Chef client enables you to run shell commands by using the execute resource. 
However, how can you pass arguments to such shell commands? Let's assume you want 
to calculate a value you need to pass to the shell command in your recipe. How can you do 
that? Let's find out...
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how we can pass Ruby variables into shell commands:
1.	 Edit your default recipe. You'll pass an argument to a shell command by using an 
execute resource:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
max_mem = node['memory']['total'].to_i * 0.8
execute 'echo max memory value into tmp file' do
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
121
  command "echo #{max_mem} > /tmp/max_mem"
end
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
3.	 Run the Chef client on your node to create the tmp file:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T22:55:20+01:00] INFO: execute[echo max memory value 
into tmp file] ran successfully
    - execute echo 6553.6 > /tmp/max_mem
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Validate that it worked:
user@server:~$ cat /tmp/max_mem
299523.2
How it works...
We calculate a value, which we want to pass to the command we want to execute. The 
node['memory']['total'] call returns a string. We need to convert it to an integer 
by calling to_i on the returned string to be able to multiply it with 0.8.
As these recipes are Ruby files, you can use string expansion if you need it. One way to pass 
arguments to shell commands defined by execute resources is to use string expansion 
in the command parameter:
command "echo #{max_mem} > /tmp/max_mem"
In the preceding line, Ruby will replace #{max_mem} with the value of the max_mem variable 
that was defined previously. The string, which we pass as a command to the execute 
resource, could look like this (assuming that node['memory']['total'] returns 1000):
command "echo 800 > /tmp/max_mem"
Be careful! You need to use double quotes if you want Ruby to expand 
your string.

There's more...
String expansion works in multi-line strings, as well. You can define them like this:
  command <<EOC
  echo #{message} > /tmp/message
EOC
EOC is the string delimiter. You're free to use whatever you want here. It can 
be EOF, EOH, STRING, FOO, or whatever you want it to be. Just make sure to 
use the same delimiter at the beginning and the end of your multi-line string.
We saw another way to pass arguments to shell commands by using environment variables 
in the previous section.

Overriding attributes
You can set attribute values in attribute files. Usually, cookbooks come with reasonable 
default values for attributes. However, the default values might not suit your needs. If they 
don't fit, you can override attribute values.
In this section, we'll look at how to override attributes from within recipes and roles.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe 
in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how we can override attribute values:
1.	 Edit the default attributes file to add an attribute:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb
default['my_cookbook']['version'] = '1.2.3'
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
123
2.	 Edit your default recipe. You'll override the value of the version attribute and 
print it to the console:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
node.override['my_cookbook']['version'] = '1.5'
execute 'echo the cookbook version' do
  command "echo #{node['my_cookbook']['version']}"
end
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node in order to create the tmp file:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T22:59:10+01:00] INFO: execute[echo the path attribute] 
ran successfully
    - execute echo 1.5
How it works...
You set a default value for the version attribute in your cookbook's default attributes file. 
Chef evaluates the attributes file early in the Chef run and makes all the attributes defined 
available via the node object. Your recipes can use the node object to access the values of 
the attributes.
The Chef DSL provides various ways to modify attributes, once they are set. In our example, 
we used the override method to change the value of the attribute inside our recipe. After 
this call, the node will carry the newly set value for the attribute, instead the old value set via 
the attributes file.
There's more...
You can override attributes from within roles and environments as well. In the following example, 
we set the version attribute to 2.0.0 (instead of keeping the default value of 1.2.3):
1.	 Edit the default attributes file to add an attribute:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb
default['my_cookbook']['version'] = '1.2.3'

2.	 Use the attribute in your default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
execute 'echo the path attribute' do
  command "echo #{node['my_cookbook']['version']}"
end
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook --force
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Create a role named upgraded_hosts by creating a file called roles/upgraded_
hosts.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/upgraded_hosts.rb
name "upgraded_hosts"
run_list "recipe[my_cookbook]"
default_attributes 'my_cookbook' => { 'version' => '2.0.0' }
5.	 Upload the role to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file 
  upgraded_hosts.rb
Updated Role upgraded_hosts!
6.	 Change the run_list of your node:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list set server 
'role[upgraded_hosts]'
 server:
    run_list: role[upgraded_hosts]
7.	
Run the Chef client on your system:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T23:04:29+00:00] INFO: execute[echo the path attribute] 
ran successfully

Using search to find nodes
If you are running your infrastructure in any type of a virtualized environment, such as a 
public or private cloud, the server instances that you use will change frequently. Instead 
of having a well-known set of servers, you destroy and create virtual servers regularly.
Your cookbooks cannot rely on hardcoded server names when you need in this situation, 
a list of available servers.
Chef provides a way to find nodes by their attributes, for example, their roles. In this 
section, we'll see how you can retrieve a set of nodes to use them in your recipes.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, as described in the Creating 
and using cookbooks section in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how we can find all nodes having a certain role:
1.	 Create a role called web that has my_cookbook in its run list. This command 
will open a JSON definition of your role in your default editor. You need to add 
"recipe[my_cookbook]" to "run_list":
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role create web
...
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[my_cookbook]"
  ],
...
Created role[web]
2.	 Create at least one node that has the new role in its run list. This command will open 
a JSON definition of your node in your default editor:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node create webserver
...
  "run_list": [

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

126
    "role[web]"
  ],
...
Created node[webserver]
3.	 Edit your default recipe to search for all nodes that have the web role:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
servers = search(:node, "role:web")
servers.each do |srv|
  log srv.name
end
4.	 Upload your modified cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
5.	 Run the Chef client on one of your nodes:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-02-19T21:32:00+00:00] INFO: webserver
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
The Chef server stores all nodes with their attributes. The attributes are partly auto-detected 
by using ohai (such as name, IP address, CPUs, and so on) and partly configured by you 
(such as run_list). The Chef DSL offers the search method to look up nodes based on 
your search criteria. In the preceding example, we simply used a role as the search criteria. 
However, you can use any combination of node attributes available to construct your search.
The search method returns a list of node objects, which you can use in your recipe. In the 
preceding example, we looped through the list of nodes by using the standard Ruby each 
iterator. The current element is available as the variable you declare between the | after the 
do. In our case, it's a full-blown node object and you can use it to retrieve its attributes, or 
even to modify it.
There's more...
Search is a very powerful tool to dynamically identify nodes. You can use Boolean operators 
to craft more complex queries and you can use search in your cookbooks, as well as with 
knife. Let's see how you can take search a bit further.

Using knife to search for nodes
Knife offers the very same search syntax as the search method within your recipes. It lets 
you search for nodes via the command line:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife search node "role:web"
3 items found
Node Name:   web
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Node Name:   web1
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Node Name:   web2
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Searching for arbitrary node attributes
In addition to searching for roles, you can search for any attribute of a node. Let's see how 
you can search for a node that has ubuntu as its platform using knife:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife search node "platform:ubuntu"
3 items found
Node Name:   web
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Node Name:   vagrant
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Node Name:   db
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Using Boolean operators in search
If you want to combine multiple attributes in your search query, you can use Boolean 
operators such as NOT, AND, and OR:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife search node 'platform:ubuntu AND 
  name:v*'
1 items found
Node Name:   vagrant
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

Using data bags
There are situations where you have data, which you neither want to hard code in your recipes 
nor store as attributes in your cookbooks. Users, external servers, or database connections 
are examples of such data. Chef offers so-called data bags to manage arbitrary collections 
of data, which you can use with your cookbooks.
Let's see how we can create and use a data bag and its items.
Getting ready
In the following example, we want to illustrate the usage of data bags by sending HTTP 
requests to a configurable HTTP endpoint. We don't want to hardcode the HTTP endpoint 
in our recipe. That's why we store it as a data bag item in a data bag.
To be able to follow along with the example, you'll need an HTTP endpoint.
One way to establish an HTTP endpoint is to just run sudo nc –l 80 on any server 
accessible by your node and use its IP address below.
Another way to establish an HTTP endpoint, which shows us the requests we make, 
is a free service called RequestBin. To use it, follow these steps:
1.	 Open http://requestb.in in your browser and click on Create a RequestBin:

Chapter 4
129
2.	 Note the URL for your new RequestBin. We'll call it from within our recipe, as 
shown in screenshot:
How to do it...
Let's create a data bag to hold our HTTP endpoint URL and use it from within our recipe:
1.	 Create a directory for your data bag:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir data_bags/hooks
2.	 Create a data bag item for RequestBin. Make sure to use your own RequestBin URL 
you noted in the Getting ready section:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/hooks/request_bin.json
{
  "id": "request_bin",
  "url": "http://requestb.in/<YOUR_REQUEST_BIN_ID>"
}
3.	 Create the data bag on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag create hooks
Created data_bag[hooks]
4.	 Upload your data bag item to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file hooks 
  request_bin.json
Updated data_bag_item[hooks::request_bin]
5.	 Edit the default recipe of my_cookbook in order to retrieve the RequestBin URL from 
your data bag:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
hook = data_bag_item('hooks', 'request_bin')
http_request 'callback' do
  url hook['url']
end

6.	 Upload your modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
7.	
Run the Chef client on your node to test whether the HTTP request to your 
RequestBin was executed:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-02T20:08:20+01:00] INFO: http_request[callback] GET to 
http://requestb.in/1ka7usr1 successful
    - http_request[callback] GET to http://requestb.in/1ka7usr1
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
8.	 Check your RequestBin. The request should show up there:
How it works...
A data bag is a named collection of structured data entries. You define each data entry called 
a data bag item in a JSON file. You can search for data bag items from within your recipes to 
use the data stored in the data bag.
In our example, we created a data bag called hooks. A data bag is a directory within your 
Chef repository and you can use knife to create it on the Chef server.
Then, we created a data bag item with the name request_bin in a file called request_bin.
json inside the data bag's directory and uploaded it to the Chef server as well.
Our recipe retrieves the data bag item using the data_bag_item method, taking the data 
bag name as the first parameter and the item name as the second parameter.

Then, we create an http_request resource by passing it the url attribute of the data 
bag item. You can retrieve any attribute from a data bag item using the Hash notation 
hook['url'].

Using search to find data bag items
You might want to execute code in your recipe multiple times—once for each data bag item, 
such as for each user or each HTTP end point.
You can use search to find certain data bag items and loop through search results to execute 
code multiple times.
Let's see how we can make our recipes more dynamic by searching for data bag items.
Getting ready
Follow the Getting ready and How to do it... (steps 1 to 4) sections in the Using data bags 
recipe in this chapter. You might want to add a few more HTTP end points to your data bag.
How to do it...
Let's create a recipe to search for data bag items and call the http_request resource 
for everyone:
1.	 Edit the default recipe of my_cookbook to retrieve all HTTP hooks, which should 
be called by your recipe from your data bag:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
search(:hooks, '*:*').each do |hook|
  http_request 'callback' do
    url hook['url']

2.	 Upload your modified recipe to the Chef server, run the Chef client on your node, 
and verify that your HTTP endpoint received the HTTP request as described in How

How it works...
Our recipe uses the search method to retrieve all items from the data bag called hooks. 
The first parameter of the search method is the name of the data bag (as Ruby symbol). The 
second parameter is the search query—in our case, we're looking for all data bag items by using 
*:*. Using the each iterator, we loop through every data bag item found. Inside the Ruby block, 
which gets executed for each item, we can access the item by using the variable hook.
We create an http_request resource for each data bag item, passing the URL stored in 
the item as the url parameter to the resource. You can access arbitrary attributes of your 
data bag item using a Hash-like notation.
There's more...
You can use various search patterns to find certain data bag items, some examples are 
shown here:
f
f
search(:hooks, "id:request_bin")
f
f
search(:hooks, "url:*request*)

Using encrypted data bag items
Data bags are a great way to store user- and application-specific data. Before long, you'll want 
to store passwords and private keys in data bags as well. However, you might (and should) be 
worried about uploading confidential data to a Chef server.
Chef offers encrypted data bag items to enable you to put confidential data into data bags, 
thus reducing the implied security risk.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a Chef repository and can access your Chef server.

How to do it...
Let's create and encrypt a data bag item and see how we can use it:
1.	 Create a directory for your encrypted data bag:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir data_bags/accounts
2.	 Create a data bag item for a Google account:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/accounts/google.json
{
  "id": "google",
  "email": "some.one@gmail.com",
  "password": "Oh! So secret?"
}
3.	 Create the data bag on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag create accounts
Created data_bag[accounts]
4.	 Upload your data bag item to the Chef server, encrypting it on the fly:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file accounts 
  google.json --secret 'Open sesame!'
Updated data_bag_item[accounts::google]
Be careful! Using the --secret command-line switch is dangerous 
because it will show up in your shell history and log files. Take a look at the 
There's more... section of this recipe to find out how to use a private key 
instead of a plaintext secret.
5.	 Verify that your data bag item is encrypted:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag show accounts google
email:
  cipher:         aes-256-cbc
  encrypted_data: 
    DqYu8DnI8E1XQ5I/

6.	 Now let's take a look at the decrypted data bag by providing the secret keys:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag show accounts google - 
  -secret 'Open sesame!'
email:    some.one@gmail.com
id:       google
password: Oh! So secret?
How it works...
Passing --secret to the knife command that is creating the data bag item encrypts the 
contents of the data bag.
The primary purpose of encrypting is to protect data on the Chef server. 
You still need to securely distribute the secret keys manually.
The ID of the data bag item will not be encrypted because the Chef server 
needs it to work with the data bag item.
Chef uses a shared secret to encrypt and decrypt data bag items. Everyone having access 
to the shared secret will be able to decrypt the contents of the encrypted data bag item.
There's more...
Accessing encrypted data bag items from the command line with knife is usually not what 
you want. Let's take a look at how to use encrypted data bag items in real life.
Using a private key file
Instead of passing the shared secret via the command line, you can create an openssl format 
private key and pass its file location to the knife command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file accounts 
  google.json --secret-file .chef/data_bag_secret_key.pem
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
135
You can create an openssl format private key like this:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ openssl genrsa -out .chef/
data_bag_secret_key.pem 1024
The preceding command assumes that you have a file called data_bag_secret_key.pem 
in the .chef directory.
To enable your node to decrypt the data bag item, you need to scp your secret key file to your 
node and place it in the /etc/chef/ directory. If you're using Vagrant, you can run vagrant 
ssh-config; scp -P 2222 .chef/data_bag_secret_key.pem 127.0.0.1:
The initial bootstrap procedure for a node will put the key in the right 
place on the node, if one already exists in your Chef repository.
Make sure that /etc/chef/client.rb points to your data_bag_secret_key.pem file:
encrypted_data_bag_secret "/etc/chef/data_bag_secret_key.pem"
Now, you can access the decrypted contents of your data bag items in your recipe:
google_account = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("accounts", 
  "google")
log google_account["password"]
Chef will look for the file configured in client.rb and use the secret given there to decrypt 
the data bag item.

Accessing data bag values from external 
scripts
Sometimes, you cannot put a server under full Chef control (yet). In such cases, you might 
want to be able to access the values managed in Chef data bags from scripts, which are not 
maintained by Chef. The easiest way to do this is to dump the data bag values (or any node 
values for that matter) into a JSON file and let your external script read them from there.

Writing Better Cookbooks
136
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create a data, as shown in the following steps, so that we can use its values later:
1.	 Create the data bag:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir data_bags/servers
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag create servers
Created data_bag[servers]
2.	 Create the first data bag item:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/servers/backup.json
{
  "id": "backup",
  "host": "10.0.0.12"
}
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file servers 
  backup.json
Updated data_bag_item[servers::backup]
How to do it...
Let's create a JSON file that contains data bag values by using our cookbook, so that external 
scripts can access those values:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
file "/etc/backup_config.json" do
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 0644
  content data_bag_item('servers', 'backup')['host'].to_json
 end
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook

137
3.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-08T21:02:24+01:00] INFO: file[/etc/backup_config.json] 
created file /etc/backup_config.json
    - create new file /etc/backup_config.json
 [2015-01-08T21:02:24+01:00] INFO: file[/etc/backup_config.json] 
updated file contents / etc/backup_config.json
    - update content in file / etc/backup_config.json from none to 
adc6de
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
user@server:~$ cat /etc/backup_config.json
"10.0.0.12"
5.	 Now, you can access the backup_config.json file from within your external 
scripts, which are not managed by Chef.
How it works...
The file resource creates a JSON file in the /etc directory. It gets the file's content directly 
from the data bag by using the data_bag_item method. This method expects the name 
of the data bag as the first argument and the name of the data bag item as the second 
argument. We then can access the host value from the data bag item and convert it to JSON.
The file resource uses this JSON converted value as its content and writes it to disk.
Now, any external script can read the value from that file.
There's more...
If you are sure that your data bag values don't get modified by the Chef client run on the node, 
you could use the Chef API directly from your script.

Getting information about the environment
Sometimes, your recipes need to know details about the environment they are modifying. 
I'm not talking about Chef environments but about things such as Linux kernel versions, 
existing users, and network interfaces.
Chef provides all this information via the node object. Let's take a look at how to retrieve it.
Getting ready
Log in to any of your Chef managed nodes and start the chef-shell:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-shell --client
chef >
How to do it...
Let's play around with the node object and take a look at what information it stores:
1.	 List which information is available. The example shows the keys available on a 
Vagrant VM. Depending on what kind of server you work on, you'll find different 
data, as shown in the following:
chef > node.keys.sort
=> ["block_device", "chef_packages", "command", "counters", 
"cpu", "current_user", "dmi", "domain", "etc", "filesystem", 
"fqdn", "hostname", "idletime", "idletime_seconds", "ip6address", 
"ipaddress", "kernel", "keys", "languages", "lsb", "macaddress", 
"memory", "network", "ntp", "ohai_time", "os", "os_version", 
"platform", "platform_family", "platform_version", "recipes", 
"roles", "root_group", "tags", "uptime", "uptime_seconds", 
"virtualization"]
2.	 Get a list of network interfaces available:
chef > node['network']['interfaces'].keys.sort
=> ["eth0", "lo"]
3.	 List all the existing user accounts:
chef > node['etc']['passwd'].keys.sort
=> ["backup", "bin", "daemon", "games", "gnats", "irc", "libuuid", 
"list", "lp", "mail", "man", "messagebus", "news", "nobody", 
"ntp", "proxy", "root", "sshd", "sync", "sys", "syslog", "uucp", 
"vagrant", "vboxadd", "www-data"]

4.	 Get the details of the root user:
chef > node['etc']['passwd']['root']
=> {"dir"=>"/root", "gid"=>0, "uid"=>0, "shell"=>"/bin/bash", 
"gecos"=>"root"}
5.	 Get the code name of the installed Ubuntu distribution:
chef > node['lsb']['codename']
=> "utopic"
6.	 Find out which kernel modules are available:
chef > node['kernel']['modules'].keys.sort
=> ["auth_rpcgss", "dm_crypt", "drm", "e1000", "fscache", "i2c_
piix4", "ip_tables", "iptable_filter", "lockd", "mac_hid", 
"nfs", "nfs_acl", "nfsd", "parport", "parport_pc", "pata_acpi", 
"ppdev", "psmouse", "serio_raw", "sunrpc", "vboxguest", "vboxsf", 
"vboxvideo", "x_tables"]
How it works...
Chef uses Ohai to retrieve a node's environment. It stores the data found by Ohai with the 
node object in a Hash-like structure called a Mash. In addition to providing key-value pairs, 
it adds methods to the node object to query the keys directly.
Instead of using node['lsb']['codename'], you could use node.lsb.codename 
as well.
There's more...
You can use the exact same calls that we used in chef-shell inside your recipes.

Luckily, Chef provides you with a host of features to write cross-platform cookbooks. With just 
a few simple commands, you can make sure that your cookbook adapts to the platform that 
your node is running on. Let's take a look at how to do this...
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in Chapter 
1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Retrieve the node's platform and execute the conditional logic in your cookbook depending on 
the platform:
1.	 Log a message only if your node is on Ubuntu:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
Log.info("Running on ubuntu") if node.platform == 'ubuntu'
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to your Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook --force
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
3.	 Log in to your node and run the Chef client to see whether it works:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-08T21:24:39+01:00] INFO: Running on Ubuntu
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 If you are not interested in a specific platform but you only need to know whether you 
run on a Debian derivative, you can place the following line in your default recipe:
Log.info("Running on a debian derivative") if 
  platform_family?('debian')
5.	 Upload the modified cookbook and run the Chef client on an Ubuntu node will show:
[2015-01-08T21:25:20+01:00] INFO: Running on a debian 
  derivative

How it works...
Ohai discovers the current node's operating system and stores it as a platform attribute with 
the node object. You can access it like any other attribute by using the Hash syntax, as follows:
node['platform']
Alternatively, you can use the method style syntax, as follows:
node.platform
Chef knows which operating systems belong together. You can use this knowledge by using 
the platform_family method from the Chef DSL.
You can then use basic Ruby conditionals, such as if, unless, or even case to make your 
cookbook do platform-specific things.
There's more...
Let's take a closer look at what else is possible.
Avoiding case statements to set values based on the platform
The Chef DSL offers the convenience methods value_for_platform and value_for_
platform_family. You can use them to avoid complex case statements and use a simple 
Hash instead. The runit cookbook, for example, uses value_for_platform to pass the 
start command for the runit service to the execute resource:
execute "start-runsvdir" do
  command value_for_platform(
    "debian" => { "default" => "runsvdir-start" },
    "ubuntu" => { "default" => "start runsvdir" },
    "gentoo" => { "default" => "/etc/init.d/runit-start start" }
  )
  action :nothing
end
The command will be runsvdir-start on Debian, start runsvdir on Ubuntu, and will 
use an init.d script on Gentoo.

Some of the built-in resources have platform-specific providers. 
These platform-specific providers will automatically be used by 
Chef. For example, the group resource uses one of the following 
providers depending on the platform:
Chef::Provider::Group::Dscl on Mac OS X
Chef::Provider::Group::Pw on FreeBSD
Chef::Provider::Group::Usermod on Solaris
Declaring support for specific operating systems in your 
cookbook's metadata
If your cookbook is written for a well-defined set of operating systems, you should list the 
supported platforms in your cookbook's metadata:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/metadata.rb
supports 'ubuntu'
If your cookbook supports multiple platforms, you can use a nice Ruby shortcut to list all the 
platforms as a Ruby array of strings (using the %w shortcut) and loop through that array to call 
supports for each platform:
%w(debian ubuntu redhat centos fedora scientific amazon oracle).each 
do |os|
  supports os
end

Finding the complete list of operating 
systems you can use in cookbooks
You want to write cookbooks that work on different operating systems, such as Ubuntu, 
RedHat, Debian, or Windows.
Inside your cookbooks, you need to distinguish between these different platforms. And you 
need to tell your cookbook which platforms it supports. However, you don't know which 
platform values you can use inside metadata.rb or your recipes.
In this section, we'll look at a very simple way to ask Chef which values it defines for a platform.

www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 4
143
How to do it...
Let's use plain Ruby to find out all the possible values for platform and use a subset of 
those in metadata.rb:
1.	 Print a list of supported platforms by querying the Chef::Platform class:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks $ ruby -rchef -e 
  'puts Chef::Platform.platforms.keys.sort.join(", ")'
aix, amazon, arch, centos, cloudlinux, debian, default, exherbo, 
fedora,
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
ubuntu, windows, xcp, xenserver
2.	 Tell the users of your cookbook which platforms it supports:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo/cookbooks $ subl 
  my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
%w(debian ubuntu mac_os_x).each do |os|
  supports os
end
How it works...
Chef maintains a set of supported operating system platforms it runs on in the 
Chef::Platform class. To query this class for the list of platforms, we use the Ruby 
command line.
We need to require the chef gem by adding an -r parameter to the ruby call.
The -e parameter contains the Ruby code that we want to execute. In our case, we use puts 
to print the result of our query to the console.
The Chef::Platform class holds a collection called platforms. We get its keys, sort them, 
and join the contents of the resulting Ruby array to a comma-separated string:
Chef::Platform.platforms.keys.sort.join(", ")
There's more...
Each platform in the Chef::Platforms collection not only has the platform name as 
the key, but a set of default providers as well.

Providers contain the platform-specific implementation details for resources. For example, 
the package resource has providers to use Apt on Ubuntu, but Yum on RedHat:
mma@laptop:~/chef_helpster $ irb
2.1.0 :001 > require 'chef'
 => true
2.1.0 :002 > Chef::Platform.platforms[:ubuntu]
 => {:default=>{:package=>Chef::Provider::Package::Apt, 
    :service=>Chef::Provider::Service::Debian, 
    :cron=>Chef::Provider::Cron, :mdadm=>Chef::Provider::Mdadm}}
Instead of using the Ruby command line, we can use the Chef classes in the Interactive 
Ruby shell (IRB).
You can change how your recipe works, depending on the platform it runs on (example taken 
from Opscode's apache cookbook):
service "apache2" do
  case node[:platform]
  when "centos","redhat","fedora","suse"
    service_name "httpd"
  ...TRUNCATED OUTPUT…
when "arch"
    service_name "httpd"
  end
  supports value_for_platform(
    "debian" => { ... },
    "ubuntu" => { ... },
   ...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
"default" => { ... }
  )
  action :enable
end
This version of the apache cookbook sets up the apache service with different names and 
commands depending on the platform, and tells Chef which actions may be called to manage 
the apache service.
Chef sets the node attribute :platform according to the underlying operating system. 
You can use this node attribute to tailor your recipe code for each platform you need.

Making recipes idempotent by using 
conditional execution
Chef manages the configuration of your nodes. It is not simply an installer for new software 
but you will run the Chef client on the existing nodes, as well as new ones.
To speed up your Chef client runs on the existing nodes, you should make sure that your 
recipes do not try to re-execute resources, which have already reached the desired state.
Running resources repeatedly will be a performance issue at best and will break your servers 
at worst. Chef offers a way to tell resources not to run or only to run if a certain condition is 
met. Let's take a look at how conditional execution of resources works.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's see how to use conditional execution in our cookbooks:
1.	 Edit your default recipe to trigger a callback only if you have set a node attribute 
called enabled:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
http_request 'callback' do
  url node['my_cookbook']['callback']['url']
  only_if { node['my_cookbook']['callback']['enabled'] }
end
2.	 Add the attributes to your cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl 
  cookbooks/my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb
default['my_cookbook']['callback']['url'] = 
  'http://www.chef.io'
default['my_cookbook']['callback']['enabled'] = true
3.	 Upload your modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook --force
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Writing Better Cookbooks
146
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node to test whether the HTTP request was executed:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
[2015-01-08T21:43:39+01:00] INFO: http_request[callback] GET to 
http://www.chef.io successful
    - http_request[callback] GET to http://www.chef.io
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
You can use only_if and not_if with every resource. In our example, we passed it a 
Ruby block. The Ruby block simply queried a node attribute. Because we set the enabled 
attribute to true, the Ruby block evaluates it to be true. And because we used only_if, 
the resource is executed.
You can use the full power of Ruby to find out whether or not the resource should run. Instead 
of using the curly braces, you can use do … end to surround a multiline Ruby block.
There's more...
Instead of passing a Ruby block, you can pass a shell command as well, as shown in the 
following code:
http_request 'callback' do
  url node['my_cookbook']['callback']['url']
  only_if "test -f /etc/passwd"
end
In this example, Chef will execute the test command in a shell. If the shell command 
returns the exit code 0, the resource will run.

Introduction
Moving files around and installing software are the most common tasks undertaken when 
setting up your nodes. In this chapter, we'll take a look at the various ways in which Chef 
supports you in dealing with files and software packages.

Creating configuration files using templates
The term Configuration Management already says it loud and clear: your recipes manage the 
configuration of your nodes. In most cases, the system configuration is held in local files, on 
disk. Chef uses templates to dynamically create configuration files from given values. It takes 
such values from data bags or attributes, or even calculates them on the fly before passing 
them into a template.
Let's see how we can create configuration files by using templates.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's use a template resource to create a configuration file:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
template "/etc/logrotate.conf" do
  source "logrotate.conf.erb"
  variables(
    how_often: "daily",
    keep: "31"
  )
end
2.	 Add an ERB template file to your recipe in its default folder:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/logrotate.conf.erb
<%= @how_often %>
rotate <%= @keep %>
create

3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:

4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:

How it works...
If you want to manage any configuration file by using Chef, you have to follow the given steps:
1.	 Copy the desired configuration file from your node to your cookbook's default 
directory under the templates folder.
2.	 Add the extension .erb to this copy.
3.	 Replace any configuration value that you want to manage with your cookbook with an 
ERB statement printing out a variable. Chef will create variables for every parameter 
that you define in the variables call in your template resource. You can use it in 
your template, like this:
<%= @variable_name -%>

150
4.	 Create a template resource in your recipe by using the newly created template as the 
source, and pass all the variables you introduced in your ERB file to it.
5.	 Running your recipe on the node will back up the original configuration file to the 
backup_path that you configured in your client.rb file (default is /var/chef/
backup) and replace it with the dynamically generated version.
Whenever possible, try using attributes instead of hardcoding values 
in your recipes.
There's more...
Be careful when a package update makes changes to the default configuration files. You need 
to be aware of those changes and merge them manually into your handcrafted configuration 
file template; otherwise, you'll lose all the configuration settings you changed using Chef.
To avoid accidental changes, it's usually a good idea to add a comment 
at the top of your configuration file to say that it is managed by Chef.

Using pure Ruby in templates for 
conditionals and iterations
Switching options on and off in a configuration file is a pretty common thing. Since Chef uses 
ERB as its template language, you can use pure Ruby to control the flow in your templates. 
You can use conditionals or even loops in your templates.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in

How to do it...
Let's create a hypothetical configuration file listing the IP addresses of a given set of backend 
servers. We only want to print that list and set a flag called enabled to true:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
template "/tmp/backends.conf" do
  mode "0444"
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  variables({
    :enabled => true,
    :backends => ["10.0.0.10", "10.0.0.11", "10.0.0.12"]
  })
end
2.	 Create your template:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/backends.conf.erb
<%- if @enabled %>
  <%- @backends.each do |backend| %>
    <%= backend %>
  <%- end %>
<%- else %>
  No backends defined!
<%- end %>
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]

How it works...
You can use plain Ruby in your templates. We will mix two concepts in our example. First, we use 
an if-else block to decide whether we should print a list of IP addresses or just a message. If 
we are going to print the list of IP addresses, we will use a loop to go through all of them.
Let's have a look at the conditional:
<%- if @enabled %>
...
<%- else %>
  No backends defined!
<%- end %>
We either pass true or false as the value of the variable called enabled. You can access 
the given variables directly in your template. If we pass true, the first block of Ruby code will 
be executed while rendering the template. If we pass false, Chef will render the string "No 
backends defined!" as the content of the file.
You can use <%- %> if you want to embed Ruby logic into your 
template file.

www.ebook777.com

Chapter 5
153
Now, let's see how we loop through the list of IPs:
  <%- @backends.each do |backend| %>
    <%= backend %>
  <%- end %>
We pass an array of strings as the value of the backend variable. In the template, we use the 
each iterator to loop through the array. While looping, Ruby assigns each value to the variable 
that we define as the looping variable between the | characters. Inside the loop, we simply 
print the value of each array element.
While it is possible to use the full power of Ruby inside your templates, it is a good idea to 
keep them as simple as possible. It is better to put more involved logic into your recipes and 
pass pre-calculated values to the template. You should limit yourself to simple conditionals 
and loops to keep templates simple.
There's more...
You can use conditionals to print strings, as shown in the following code:
<%= "Hello world!" if @enabled -%>
If you use this in your template, the string Hello world! will be printed only if the variable 
enabled is set to true.

Installing packages from a third-party 
repository
Even though the Ubuntu package repository contains many up-to-date packages, you might 
bump into situations in which either the package you need is missing or outdated. In such 
cases, you can either use third-party repositories or your own repositories (containing self-made 
packages). Chef makes it simple to use additional APT repositories with the apt cookbook.

Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in

Let's retrieve the required apt cookbook:
1.	 Add it to Berksfile:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
source 'https://supermarket.getchef.com'
cookbook 'apt'
2.	 Install it to your local workstation:

Remember that if you're using Vagrant and have installed the Berkshelf 
plugin, all you need to run is vagrant provision to get the apt 
cookbook installed on your node.

Let's take a look at how you can install the s3cmd tool from the repository available at www.
s3tools.org on a Ubuntu Lucid 12.04 LTS node:
Ubuntu Utopic 14.04 LTS already comes with s3cmd version 1.5.0-rc1-
2 installed, and therefore, the following recipe isn't necessary to get the 
latest version of s3cmd installed.
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:

  action :add
end

2.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata to add a dependency on the apt cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "apt"
3.	 Upload the modified my_cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Validate that the s3cmd package is not yet installed:
user@server:~$ dpkg -l s3cmd
No packages found matching s3cmd.
5.	 Validate that the default repository will install an older version of s3cmd (1.0.0-1):
user@server:~$ apt-cache showpkg s3cmd
Package: s3cmd
Versions:
1.0.0-1 (/var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_
precise_universe_binary-amd64_Packages)

How it works...
The apt cookbook provides an easy way to deal with additional APT repositories.
If you don't use Berkshelf, as described in the Managing cookbook 
dependencies with Berkshelf recipe in Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure, 
you need to use knife cookbook site install to download the 
apt cookbook to your workstation and knife cookbook upload 
apt to install it on your Chef server.
We need to tell Chef that we want to use the apt cookbook by adding the depends call to our 
cookbook's metadata.rb file.
The apt cookbook defines the apt_repository resource. To be able to use it, we need to 
include the apt recipe in our default recipe:
include_recipe "apt"
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5
157
As soon as the apt cookbook is available, we can add the third-party repository by using the 
apt_repository resource:
apt_repository "s3tools" do
  uri "http://s3tools.org/repo/deb-all"
  components ["stable/"]
  key "http://s3tools.org/repo/deb-all/stable/s3tools.key"
  action :add
end
After adding the third-party repository, we can install the desired package from there:
package "s3cmd"

Installing software from source
If you need to install a piece of software that is not available as a package for your 
platform, you will need to compile it yourself.
In Chef, you can easily do this by using the script resource. What is more challenging 
is to make such a script resource idempotent.
In the following recipe, we will see how to do both.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Retrieve the required cookbooks:
1.	 Add them to your Berksfile:

Remember that if you're using Vagrant and have installed the Berkshelf 
plugin, all you need to run is the Vagrant provision to get the required 
cookbooks installed on your node.
How to do it...
Let's take nginx as a well-known example for installing it from source:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
include_recipe "apt"
include_recipe "build-essential"
version = "1.7.9"
bash "install_nginx_from_source" do
  cwd Chef::Config['file_cache_path']
  code <<-EOH
    wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-#{version}.tar.gz
    tar zxf nginx-#{version}.tar.gz &&
    cd nginx-#{version} &&
    ./configure --without-http_rewrite_module && make && make 
install

2.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata to add a dependency on the apt cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "apt"
depends "build-essential"
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

    - execute "bash"  "/tmp/chef-script20150112-13681-1m0wt4u"
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Validate that nginx is installed:
user@server:~$ /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -v
nginx version: nginx/1.7.9
The nginx community cookbook has a recipe to install nginx from 
source. The following example only illustrates how you can install any 
software from source.
How it works...
The bash resource executes only if the nginx executable is not yet there. Our not_if 
block tests for this.
To be able to compile code on your node, you'll need to have the build essentials installed. 
That's why you need to include the build-essential cookbook before you run your script 
to make sure you have a compiler installed.
Before Chef runs the script given as code, it changes into the working directory that is given 
as cwd. We use Chef's file cache directory instead of /tmp because the contents of /tmp 
might get deleted during reboot. In order to avoid downloading the source tarball again, 
we need to keep it at a permanent location.

Usually, you would retrieve the value for the version variable from an 
attribute defined in my_cookbook/attributes/default.rb.
The script itself simply unpacks the tarball, configures, prepares, and installs nginx. We chain 
the commands using && to avoid running the following commands if an earlier one fails.
<<-EOH
...
EOH
The preceding code is a Ruby construct that denotes multiline strings.
There's more...
Right now, this recipe will download the source tarball repeatedly, even if it is already there 
(at least as long as the nginx binary is not found). You can use the remote_file resource 
instead of calling wget in your bash script. The remote_file resource is idempotent—it will 
only download the file if it needs to.
Change your default recipe in the following way to use the remote_file resource:
include_recipe 'apt'
include_recipe 'build-essential'
version = "1.7.9"
remote_file "fetch_nginx_source" do
  source "http://nginx.org/download/nginx-#{version}.tar.gz"
  path "#{Chef::Config['file_cache_path']}/nginx-#{version}.tar.gz"
end
bash "install_nginx_from_source" do
  cwd Chef::Config['file_cache_path']
  code <<-EOH
    tar zxf nginx-#{version}.tar.gz &&
    cd nginx-#{version} &&
    ./configure --without-http_rewrite_module &&
    make && make install

Running a command when a file is updated
If your node is not under complete Chef control, it might be necessary to trigger commands 
when Chef changes a file. For example, you might want to restart a service that is not 
managed by Chef when its configuration file (which is managed by Chef) changes. Let's 
see how you can achieve this with Chef.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's create an empty file as a trigger and run a bash command, if that file changes:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
template "/tmp/trigger" do
  notifies :run, "bash[run_on_trigger]", :immediately
end
bash "run_on_trigger" do
  user "root"
  cwd "/tmp"
  code "echo 'Triggered'"
  action :nothing
end
2.	 Create an empty template:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ touch cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/trigger.erb
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

3.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * template[/tmp/trigger] action create[2015-01-
12T20:52:19+00:00] INFO: template[/tmp/trigger] created file /tmp/
trigger
    - create new file /tmp/trigger[2015-01-12T20:52:19+00:00] 
INFO: template[/tmp/trigger] updated file contents /tmp/trigger
    - update content in file /tmp/trigger from none to e3b0c4
    (no diff)
[2015-01-12T20:52:19+00:00] INFO: template[/tmp/trigger] sending 
run action to bash[run_on_trigger] (immediate)
  * bash[run_on_trigger] action runTriggered
[2015-01-12T20:52:19+00:00] INFO: bash[run_on_trigger] ran 
successfully
    - execute "bash"  "/tmp/chef-script20150112-16221-1q4r38y"
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Run the Chef client again to verify that the run_on_trigger script does not get 
executed again:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Recipe: my_cookbook::default
  * template[/tmp/trigger] action create (up to date)
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
We define a template resource and tell it to notify our bash resource immediately. Chef will 
notify the bash resource only if the template resource changes the file. To make sure that 
the bash script runs only when notified, we define its action as nothing.

We see in the output of the first Chef client run (which created the trigger file) that the bash 
script was executed:
bash[run_on_trigger] ran successfully
We see in the output of the second Chef client run that this message is missing. Chef did not 
execute the script because it did not modify the trigger file.
There's more...
Instead of a template, you can let a file or remote_file resource trigger a bash script. When 
compiling programs from source, you will download the source tarball using a remote_file 
resource. This resource will trigger a bash resource to extract and compile the program.

Distributing directory trees
You need to seed a directory tree on your nodes. It might be a static website or some 
backup data, which is needed on your nodes. You want Chef to make sure that all the files 
and directories are there on your nodes. Chef offers the remote_directory resource to 
handle this case. Let's see how you can use it.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a cookbook called my_cookbook, and that the run_list of your node 
includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's upload a directory with some files to our node:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
remote_directory "/tmp/chef.github.com" do
  files_backup 10
  files_owner "root"

  files_group "root"
  files_mode 00644
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode 00755
end
2.	 Create a directory structure on your workstation with files that you want to upload to 
your node. In this example, I am using a plain GitHub pages directory, which contains 
a static website. To follow along, you can use whatever directory structure you want—
just be careful that it doesn't get too big so that it doesn't take hours to upload. Just 
move the directory to the files/default directory inside your cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mv chef.github.com cookbooks/my_cookbook/
files/default
Chef will not upload empty directories.
3.	 Upload the modified cookbook on the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client

5.	 Validate that the directory and its files are there on the node:

4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 22 08:36 javascripts
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 22 08:36 stylesheets
How it works...
You need to put the directory that you want to distribute to your nodes into your cookbook 
under the default folder of files. The remote_directory resource picks it up from 
there and uploads it to your nodes. By default, the name of the resource (in our example, 
/tmp/chef.github.com) will act as the target directory.
Be careful not to put very heavy directory structures into your 
cookbooks. You will not only need to distribute them to every node 
but also to your Chef server.
There's more...
While you could use the remote_directory resource to deploy your applications, there 
are better ways to do the same. Either you could use any of Chef's application cookbooks 
that are available, for example, for Ruby (application_ruby) or PHP (application_php) 
applications, or you could use tools such as Capistrano or Mina for deployment.

Cleaning up old files
What happens if you want to remove a software package from your node? You should be 
aware that Chef does not undo its changes. Removing a resource from your cookbook does 
not mean that Chef will remove the resource from your nodes. You need to do this by yourself.
In today's infrastructure, it's far better to replace a node than try to 
clean things up with Chef.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Make sure that you have a remote_directory resource in my_cookbook, as described 
in the Distributing directory trees recipe.
How to do it...
Let's remove the remote_directory resource from my_cookbook and see what happens:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe and remove the remote_directory resource:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
# there used to be the remote_directory resource
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook

3.	 Run the Chef client on your node:

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Validate that the directory and its files are still there on the node:
user@server:~$ ls -l /tmp/chef.github.com
total 16
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 22 08:36 images
4 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3383 Mar 22 08:36 index.html
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 22 08:36 javascripts
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 22 08:36 stylesheets
Now, let's explicitly remove the directory structure:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
directory "/tmp/chef.github.com" do
  action :delete
  recursive true
end
2.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
3.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

4.	 Validate that the directory and its files are deleted from the node:

Working with Files and Packages

How it works...
Removing a resource from your cookbook will lead to Chef not knowing anything about it 
anymore. Chef does not touch things that are not defined in cookbooks, even if it might 
have created them once.
To clean up stuff you created using Chef, you need to put the reverse actions into your 
cookbooks. If you created a directory using Chef, you need to explicitly delete it by using 
the directory resource with action :delete in your cookbook.
The directory resource is idempotent. Even if the directory is already deleted, it will run fine 
and simply do nothing.
There's more...
If you upload a directory structure by using the remote_directory resource, you can use 
the purge parameter to delete files within that directory structure if they are no longer in your 
cookbook. In this case, you do not need to delete each file by using a file resource with the 
delete action:
remote_directory "/tmp/chef.github.com" do
  ...
  purge true
end

Distributing different files based on the 
target platform
If you have nodes with different operating systems, such as Ubuntu and CentOS, you might 
want to deliver different files to each of them. There might be differences in the necessary 
configuration options and the like. Chef offers a way for files and templates to differentiate 
which version to use, based on a node's platform.

Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
How to do it...
Let's add two templates to our cookbook and see which one gets used:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
template "/tmp/message" do
  source "message.erb"
end
2.	 Create a template as a default:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/message.erb
Hello from default template!
3.	 Create a template only for Ubuntu 14.04 nodes:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
ubuntu-14.04/message.erb
Hello from Ubuntu 14.04!
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife cookbook upload my_cookbook
Uploading my_cookbook    [0.1.0]
5.	 Run the Chef client on your node:

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate that the Ubuntu specific template has been used:
user@server:~$ sudo cat /tmp/message
Hello from Ubuntu 14.04!
How it works...
Chef tries to use the most specific template for a given platform by looking for templates 
in the following order, if the given platform is Ubuntu 14.04:
my_cookbook/templates/my_node.example.com/message.erb
my_cookbook/templates/ubuntu-14.04/message.erb
my_cookbook/templates/ubuntu-14/message.erb
my_cookbook/templates/ubuntu/message.erb
my_cookbook/templates/default/message.erb
Chef takes the first hit. If there is a file in a directory with the same name as the 
fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the node, it will take that one.
If not, it will look through the other directories (if they exist), such as ubuntu-14.04 or 
ubuntu-14, and so on.
The only directory, which is mandatory, is the default directory.

After dealing with users, we'll take a look at how to install and manage more advanced 
applications. Our examples mainly cover a web application stack using nginx as a web 
server, MySQL as a database, and WordPress or Ruby on Rails for the web application.
We'll close the chapter with showing you how to manage your local workstation with Chef.
Creating users from data bags
When managing a set of servers, it's important to make sure that the right people (and only 
they) have access. You definitely don't want a shared account whose password is known by 
everyone. You don't want to hardcode any users into your recipes either, because you want 
to separate logic and data.
Chef helps you to manage users on your nodes using data bags for your users and let a 
recipe create and remove the users, accordingly.
Let's take a look at how you can do that.
Getting ready
Make sure the you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks section in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository  which includes my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
Make sure that you have a public SSH key available for your user by following the instructions 
at http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-
SSH-Public-Key
How to do it...
First, we need to set up the data bag and at least one data bag item for our first user:
1.	 Create a data bag for your users:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag create users
Created data_bag[users]
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
173
2.	 Create a directory for your data bag item's JSON files:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p data_bags/users
3.	 Create a data bag item for your first user. Keep the username as the filename (here, 
mma). You need to replace ssh-rsa AAA345...bla== mma@laptop with the 
contents of your public key file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/users/mma.json
{
  "id": "mma",
  "ssh_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa AAA345...bla== mma@laptop"
  ],
  "groups": [ "staff"],
  "shell": "\/bin\/bash"
}
4.	 Upload the data bag item to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file users mma.json
Updated data_bag_item[users::mma]
Because the Chef server indexes data bags, it can take a few minutes 
until a new data bag is available for use. If you encounter an error, 
please wait a few minutes and then try again.
Now it's time to set up the recipe to manage our users:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb to include the dependency on the 
users cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
depends "users"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Installing users (1.7.0)

include_recipe "users"
users_manage "staff" do
  group_id 50
  action [ :remove, :create ]
end
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Uploading my_cookbook (0.1.0) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/

user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * users_manage[staff] action remove (up to date)
  * users_manage[staff] action create
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate that the user, mma, exists:
user@server:~$ fgrep mma /etc/passwd
mma:x:1000:1000::/home/mma:/bin/bash
7.	
Validate that the user, mma, belongs to the group staff now:
user@server:~$ fgrep staff /etc/group
staff:x:50:mma
How it works...
The users cookbook requires that you create a users data bag and one data bag item for 
each user. In that data bag item, you define the attributes of the user: groups, shell, and 
so on. You even can include an action attribute, which defaults to create, but could be 
remove as well.
To be able to manage users with my_cookbook, you need to include the users cookbook 
as a dependency. In your recipe, you can include the users cookbook's default recipe in order 
to be able to use the manage_users Light Weight Resource Provider (LWRP), provided by 
the users cookbook.

Chapter 6
175
The manage_users LWRP takes its name attribute "staff" as the group name it should 
manage. It searches for data bag items, which have this group in their groups entry, and 
uses every entry found to create those users and groups.
The manage_users LWRP replaces group members—existing 
(non-Chef managed) users will get thrown out of the given group 
(bad, if you manage the sudo group on Vagrant).
By passing both actions, :create and :remove, into the LWRP, we make sure that it 
searches for both: users to remove and users to add.
There's more...
Let's take a look at how you can remove a user:
1.	 Edit the data bag item for your first user, setting action to remove:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/users/mma.json
{
  "id": "mma",
  "ssh_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa AAA345...bla== mma@laptop"
  ],
  "groups": [ "staff"],
  "shell": "\/bin\/bash",
  "action": "remove"
}
2.	 Upload the data bag item to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file users mma.json
Updated data_bag_item[users::mma]
3.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
- remove user user[mma]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Validate that the user mma does not exist anymore:
user@server:~$ fgrep mma /etc/passwd

The Using data Bags recipe in Chapter 4, Writing Better Cookbooks
Securing the Secure Shell Daemon (SSHD)
Depending on your Linux flavor, the ssh daemon might listen on all network interfaces 
on the default port, and allow root and password logins.
This default configuration is not very safe. Automated scripts can try to guess the root 
password. You're at the mercy of the strength of your root password.
It's a good idea to make things stricter. Let's see how you can do this.
Getting ready
Create a user who can log in using his ssh key instead of a password. Doing this with Chef 
is described in the Creating users from data bags recipe in this chapter.
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
Note that configuring sshd might lock you out of your system. Make sure 
you have an open ssh connection with root access to fix what an error in 
your cookbook might have broken!

How to do it...
We'll secure sshd by disabling the root login (you should use sudo instead) and by disabling 
password logins. Users should only be able to log in using their ssh key.
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb and add a dependency on the 
openssh cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "openssh"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:

node.default['openssh']['server']['permit_root_login'] = "no"

"no"

6.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
user@server:~$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# This file was generated by Chef for vagrant.vm
# Do NOT modify this file by hand!
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
How it works...
The openssh cookbook offers attributes for most configuration parameters in 
ssh_config and sshd_config. We override the default values in our cookbook 
and include the openssh default recipe.
The order is significant here because this way, the openssh recipe will use our overridden 
values instead of its default values.
The openssh cookbook writes the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and restarts the 
sshd service. After running this recipe, you will no longer be able to SSH into the node 
using a password.
There's more...
If your nodes are connected to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) by using a second network 
interface, it's a good idea to bind sshd to that secure network only. This way, you block 
anyone from the public Internet trying to hack into your sshd.
You can override listen_address in your cookbook:
node.default['openssh']['server']['listen_address']
If your nodes need to be accessible via the Internet, you might want to move sshd to a 
higher port to avoid automated attacks:
node.default['openssh']['server']['port'] = '6222'
In this case, you need to use -p 6222 with your ssh commands in order to be able to 
connect to your nodes.

Moving sshd to a non-privileged port adds one layer of security, 
but comes at the price of moving from a privileged port to a non-
privileged port on your node. This presents the risk that someone on 
your box might highjack that port. Read more about the implications

putting-ssh-on-another-port-than-22-is-bad-idea/

Find a detailed list of all attributes the openssh cookbook offers to configure sshd 
at https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/openssh/blob/master/
attributes/default.rb
Enabling passwordless sudo
You have secured your sshd so that your users can only log in with their own user accounts, 
instead of root. Additionally, you made sure that your users do not need passwords, but 
have to use their private keys for authentication.
However, once authenticated, users want to administer the system. That's why it is a 
good idea to have sudo installed on all boxes. Sudo enables non-root users to execute 
commands as root, if they're allowed to. Sudo will log all such command executions.
To make sure that your users don't need passwords here, you should configure sudo 
for passwordless logins. Let's take a look at how to do this.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'

How to do it...
Let's make Chef modify the sudo configuration to enable passwordless sudo for the 
staff group:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb and add the dependency on the sudo cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "sudo"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Installing sudo (2.7.1)
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
3.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
node.default['authorization']['sudo']['passwordless'] = true
node.default['authorization']['sudo']['groups'] = ['staff', 
'vagrant']
include_recipe 'sudo'
Vagrant users: If you are working with a vagrant managed VM, make 
sure to include the vagrant group in the sudo configuration; 
otherwise, your vagrant user will not be able to sudo anymore.
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks upload

5.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * template[/etc/sudoers] action create
[2015-02-09T20:22:20+00:00] INFO: template[/etc/sudoers] backed up

20:22:20.751179595 +0000
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate the content of the generated sudoers file:
user@server:~$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
...
# Members of the group 'staff' may gain root privileges
%staff ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
# Members of the group 'vagrant' may gain root privileges
%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
How it works...
The sudo cookbook rewrites the /etc/sudoers file by using the attribute values that we set 
in the node. In our case, we set the following:
node.default['authorization']['sudo']['passwordless'] = true
This will tell the sudo cookbook that we want to enable our users to sudo without passwords.
Then, we tell the sudo cookbook which groups should have passwordless sudo rights:
node.default['authorization']['sudo']['groups'] = ['staff', 'vagrant']
The last step is to include the sudo cookbook's default recipe to let it install and configure 
sudo on your nodes:
include_recipe 'sudo'

There's more...
By using the LWRP from the sudo cookbook, you can manage each group or user individually. 
The LWRP will place configuration fragments inside /etc/sudoers.d. You can use this to 
use your own template for the sudo configuration:
sudo 'mma' do
  template    'staff_member.erb' # local cookbook template
  variables   :cmds => ['/etc/init.d/ssh restart']
end
This snippet assumes that you have my_cookbook/templates/default/staff_
member.erb in place.

Managing NTP
Your nodes should always have synchronized clocks, if nothing else, because the Chef server 
requires clients' clocks to be synchronized with it. This is required because the authentication 
of clients is based on a time window in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
NTP is there to synchronize your nodes' clocks with its upstream peers. It usually uses a set 
of trusted upstream peers so that it gets a reliable timing signal.
It's a good idea to put the installation of NTP into a role, which you assign to every node. 
Bugs caused by clocks, which are out of sync, are not nice to track down. Better avoid them 
in the first place by using NTP on every node.
Getting ready
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including the ntp cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'ntp'
Install the ntp cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install

How to do it...
Let's create a role called "base", which ensures that your nodes will synchronize their clocks, 
using NTP:
1.	 Create a base.rb file for your role:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/base.rb
name "base"
run_list "recipe[ntp]"
default_attributes "ntp" => {
  "servers" => ["0.pool.ntp.org", "1.pool.ntp.org", "2.pool.ntp.
org"]
}
2.	 Upload the new role to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file base.rb
Updated Role base!
3.	 Add the base role to your node's run list:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list set server 
'role[base]'
server:
  run_list: role[base]
4.	 Run the Chef client on your node:

5.	 Validate that ntp is installed correctly:
user@server:~$ /etc/init.d/ntp status
* NTP server is running
How it works...
The ntp cookbook installs the required packages for your node's platform and writes a 
configuration file. You can influence the configuration by setting default attributes in the ntp 
namespace. In the preceding example, we configured the upstream NTP servers for our node 
to query.
If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, the ntp cookbook installs ntpdate as well. 
ntpdate is there to quickly synchronize and set a node's date and time.
There's more...
The ntp cookbook also contains an ntp::undo recipe. You can completely remove NTP from 
your node by adding ntp::undo to your node's run list.

Managing nginx
Say you need to set up a website, which handles a lot of traffic simultaneously. nginx is a web 
server that is designed to handle many connections and is used by a lot of big web companies 
such as Facebook, Dropbox, and WordPress.
You'll find nginx packages in most major distributions, but if you want to extend nginx by using 
modules, you'll need to compile nginx from source.
In this section, we'll configure the nginx community cookbook to do just that.
Getting ready
Let's get ready for set up of nginx:
1.	 Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including the nginx cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'nginx'
2.	 Install the nginx cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How to do it...
Let's set up a role and configure how we want to build nginx:
1.	 Create a new role called web_server with the following content:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/web_server.rb
name "web_server"

run_list "recipe[nginx::source]"
default_attributes "nginx" => {
  "version" => "1.7.9",
  "init_style" => "init",
  "enable_default_site" => false,
  "upload_progress" => {
    "url" => "https://github.com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-
module/archive/v0.9.1.tar.gz",
    "checksum" => 
"99ec072cca35cd7791e77c40a8ded41a7a8c1111e057be26e55fba2fdf105f43"
  },
  "source" => {
  "checksum" => 
1aafc7f0f530ddaa86d4ba24c14941ce0a584cc896f8261d6218f99625318f8a",
    "modules" => ["nginx::upload_progress_module"]
  }
}
To generate the checksum for the remote_file resource, you need to 
run the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ shasum -a 256 <PATH_TO_FILE>
To generate the checksum for the upload_progress module, you can 
run the following command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ curl -L -s https://github.
com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-module/archive/
v0.9.1.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
To generate the checksum for the nginx source, run the following 
command:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/
nginx-1.7.9.tar.gz
2.	 Upload the role to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file web_server.rb
Updated Role web_server!
3.	 Add the web_server role to your node's run list:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list set server 'role[web_
server]'
server:
  run_list: role[web_server]

    - restart service service[nginx]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Validate that nginx is installed with upload_progress_module:
user@server:~$ /opt/nginx-1.7.9/sbin/nginx -V
nginx version: nginx/1.7.9
built by gcc 4.9.1 (Ubuntu 4.9.1-16ubuntu6)
TLS SNI support enabled
configure arguments: --prefix=/opt/nginx-1.7.9 --conf-path=/etc/
nginx/nginx.conf --sbin-path=/opt/nginx-1.7.9/sbin/nginx --with-
http_ssl_module --with-http_gzip_static_module --add-module=/var/
chef/cache/nginx_upload_progress/99ec072cca35cd7791e77c40a8ded41a7
a8c1111e057be26e55fba2fdf105f43
How it works...
We configure nginx in our new role web_server. First, we decide that we want to install 
nginx from source because we want to add an additional module. We do this by adding 
the nginx::source recipe to the run list:
run_list "recipe[nginx::source]"
Then, we set the attributes that will be necessary for our source build. They all live in the 
nginx name space:
default_attributes "nginx" => {
...
}
Since we want to use the default way of starting the nginx service on Ubuntu, we set 
init_style to init. This will create start up scripts for init.d, as shown in the 
following code:
"init_style" => "init",
Other options would have been to use runit or bluepill, among others.

Next, we have to tell the nginx recipe where to find the source code for the upload_
progress module and provide the SHA checksum for the file, so that the remote_file 
resource can validate that the file it downloads is exactly the one you requested:
"upload_progress" => {
    "url" => "https://github.com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-
module/archive/v0.9.1.tar.gz ",
"checksum" => "..."
  },
Finally, we have to instruct the nginx recipe to compile nginx with upload_progress_
module enabled:
"source" => {
    "modules" => ["upload_progress_module"]
  }
After defining the role, we have to upload it to the Chef server and add it to the node's run 
list. Running the Chef client on the node will now create all the necessary directories, 
download all the required sources, and build nginx with the module enabled.
The nginx cookbook will create a default site, which we disabled in our role settings. It installs 
nginx in /opt/nginx-1.7.9/sbin.
There's more...
If you only want to use your distribution's default nginx package, you can use the nginx 
default recipe instead of nginx::source in your role's run list:
run_list "recipe[nginx]"
If you want to disable the default site, you need to set the attributes accordingly:
"default_site_enabled" => false
You'll find all tunable configuration parameters in the nginx cookbook's attributes file. 
You can modify them according to preceding examples.
The nginx cookbook sets up handling of sites and its configuration 
in a similar way to Debian's way of configuring Apache2. You can use 
nxdissite and nxensite to disable and enable your sites, which 
you will find under /etc/nginx/sites-available and /etc/
nginx/sites-enabled, respectively.
You can set up nginx as a reverse proxy using the application_nginx cookbook.

Creating nginx virtual hosts
Assuming you have nginx installed, you want to manage your websites with Chef. You need 
to create an nginx configuration file for your website and upload your HTML file(s). Let's see 
how to do this.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook, as described in the Creating

1.	 Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
2.	 Create or edit a role called web_server with the following content:

How to do it...
Let's put together all the code to configure your site in nginx and upload a sample 
index.html file:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb file to include the dependency on the 
nginx cookbook:

Validate whether the nginx site is up and running by requesting index.html 
from the web server:

8.	 Validate whether the downloaded index.html file contains the text we set:
user@server:~$ cat index.html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>+
How it works...
After setting two variables, the recipe installs a template for the nginx configuration file. 
The template ends up as /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_app and gets symlinked 
to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/my_app.
Next, we create the directory and the index.html file in /srv/my_app/public. This is 
the directory that our nginx configuration template uses as its root location.
Finally, we enable the site that we just created using the nginx_site resource, which is 
defined by the nginx cookbook.
The configuration file template nginx-site-my_app.erb makes nginx listen on port 80 
and defines the root location as /srv/my_app/public.
There's more...
If you want to disable your site, consider the following line:
nginx_site "#{app_name}"

Replace the preceding line with the folllowing:
nginx_site "#{app_name}"  do
  enable false
end
After uploading the modified cookbook and running the Chef client again, you should not be 
able to retrieve index.html file anymore:
user@server:~$ wget localhost

client and server.
Let's see how we can install MySQL server and create a database and a database user.

How it works...
First, we install the mysql2 Ruby gem so that Chef can access MySQL:
mysql2_chef_gem 'default' do
  action :install
end
Since we want to connect to our MySQL server multiple times, we define the connection 
parameters as a variable called connection_params in our recipe:
connection_params = {
  :username => 'root',
  :password => 'root_password_15',
  :host => '127.0.0.1'
}
Now, it's time to install MySQL Server 5.5 listening to port 3306 and start it:
mysql_service 'default' do
  port '3306'
  version '5.5'
  initial_root_password connection_params[:password]
  action [:create, :start]
end
Then, we use the mysql_database resource from the database cookbook to create a 
database called my_db:
mysql_database 'my_db' do
  connection connection_params
  action :create
end
Finally, we use the mysql_database_user resource to create a user called me and 
grant them all privileges:
mysql_database_user 'me' do
  connection connection_params
  password 'my_password_11'
  privileges [:all]
  action [:create, :grant]

Managing WordPress sites
You need to enable your business users to manage their own website. Fast. WordPress 
has come a long way. You might have seen it as a simple blogging tool, however, in recent 
years, it has grown into a fully featured content management system. Fortunately, managing 
WordPress with Chef is pretty straightforward.
Let's take a look at how to do it.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
If you're using Vagrant for your node, you need to configure a bridged 
network to be able to browse to your WordPress installation from your 
local workstation:
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.network :bridged
end

How to do it...
We'll install WordPress by using the community cookbook:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata to make sure it depends on the wordpress cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "wordpress"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
3.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe to set some attributes and include the 
wordpress cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
node.default['apache']['mpm'] = 'prefork'
node.default['wordpress']['db']['database'] = "my_wordpress"
node.default['wordpress']['db']['user'] = "me"
node.default['wordpress']['db']['password'] = "my_password_11"

6.	 Validate whether WordPress is installed on your host by firing up your browser and 
navigating to the WordPress installation page:
How it works...
The wordpress cookbook installs a full Apache-MySQL-PHP-stack. That's why, when you're 
installing it in your repository, it will install quite a few supporting cookbooks as well.
To use the wordpress cookbook, you simply include it in your own cookbook's recipe:
include_recipe 'wordpress'
Because we do not like the default values for the database name, database user, and 
the password for the database user, we override those attributes at the beginning of 
our default recipe:
node.default['wordpress']['db']['database'] = 'my_wordpress'
node.default['wordpress']['db']['user'] = 'me'
node.default['wordpress']['db']['password'] = 'my_password_11'
You can lookup the default values in cookbooks/wordpress/attributes/default.rb.
There's more...
The wordpress cookbook installs the complete stack but does not set up your first blog. It 
asks you to call the WordPress installation page with your browser to set up your first blog.

Managing Ruby on Rails applications
Ruby on Rails helps you to quickly get your web applications up and running. However, 
deployment is not an issue solved by the framework. In this section, we'll see how to write 
the simplest possible recipe to deploy a Rails application, using unicorn as the application 
server and SQLite as the database.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
How to do it...
Let's get our Ruby on Rails application up and running on our node:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb file to make it depend on the 
application_ruby cookbook:

...
depends "application_ruby"

application "rails-app" do
  packages %w[build-essential ruby2.1-dev runit git libsqlite3-dev

    database do
      adapter "sqlite3"
      database "db/rails-app.sqlite3"
    end
  end
  unicorn do
  end
end
4.	 Add your own template file to your database.yml file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/

of your Rails app shows up:
user@server:~$ cat index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>

Chef provides an abstract application cookbook to deploy web applications. We call our 
application rails-app:
application "rails-app" do

Inside the application block, we define the details of our web app. First, we need to install a 
few operating system packages as follows:
  packages %w[build-essential ruby2.1-dev runit git libsqlite3-dev 
libssl-dev]
The ruby2.1-dev package will make sure that we have Ruby runtime and headers to build 
native gems installed. If you installed your Chef client by using the Omnibus installer, it comes 
with an embedded Ruby, which you might not want to use to run your Rails application.
Since we're going to use unicorn to run our Rails application, we need to install runit 
because that's the way that unicorn is installed at the time of writing this book.
Git is required to be able to check out our repository from www.github.com.
Finally, we're using SQLite for our Rails application and need to install it first.
The next step is to configure the deployment details—where our app should go (path), which 
user and group should own the application (owner, group), and where our app should  find 
the source code of our app (repository):
path "/usr/local/www/rails-app"
  owner "www-data"
  group "www-data"
...
repository "https://github.com/mmarschall/rails-app.git"
Make sure you enabled the unicorn gem in your Rails application's Gemfile:
gem 'unicorn'
If you don't want to run your application in the production environment, you can specify 
the desired environment_name in your cookbook, just as we did:
environment_name "development"
Your application will be fetched from www.github.com and the cookbook will install it in 
a directory structure similar to a directory structure that is maintained by Capistrano. It will 
put the current revision of your app into the releases directory and create a symlink to it
 as current.
Now, it's time to define the Rails-specific things. First of all, we want to install the bundler 
gem because our Rails application uses Gemfile for its dependencies:
rails do
    gems %w[bundler]
    ...
end

www.ebook777.com

The %w[] syntax creates an array of strings. You could write ["bundler"] instead. It doesn't 
make any difference for one element, but when placing multiple elements into your array, you 
save a lot of double quotes and commas with the %w syntax.
Since our Rails application uses SQLite as its persistence store, we need to use our own 
template for the database.yml file:
database_template "sqlite3_database.yml.erb"
Then, we can use a database block to populate it with the values we need:
database do
  adapter "sqlite3"
  database "db/rails-app.sqlite3"
end
We need to tell our Rails application that we're using a SQLite database and want it to store 
its data in a file called db/rails-app.sqlite3.
Finally, we need to tell our cookbook that we want to run our Rails application by using 
unicorn. An empty block will suffice, as long as we don't want to change any default attributes 
such as port number or number of workers:
unicorn do
end
There's more...
Usually, the application cookbook's deploy resource will only deploy new revisions of your 
Rails app. If you want to ensure that it grabs the same revision again and again, you need to 
call the force_deploy action on your application resource:
application "rails-app" do
  ...
  action :force_deploy
end
If you want to use a new or existing MySQL server, you can assign it a role, for example, 
rails_database_master, and pass that role name to the application resource. It 
will then search for the node and use its IP address in database.yml:
application "rails-app" do
  ...

www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 6
205
  database_master_role " rails_database_master"
end
In this case, you don't need to use your own database.yml template.
If you want to run a cluster of nodes, each one installed with your Rails application, you can 
use the application_nginx cookbook to install an nginx load balancer in front of your 
application server cluster and the database cookbook to set up a networked database 
instead of SQLite.

Managing Varnish
Varnish is a web application accelerator. You install it in front of your web application to 
cache generated HTML files and serve them faster. It will take a lot of burden from your 
web application and can even provide you with extended uptime—covering up for application 
failures through its cache while you are fixing your application.
Let's see how to install Varnish.
Getting ready
You need a web server running on your node at port 8080. We'll set up Varnish to use 
localhost:8080 as its backend host and port. You can achieve this by installing a Ruby on 
Rails application on your node as described in the Managing Ruby on Rails applications recipe.
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'

How to do it...
Let's install Varnish with its default parameters. We will use the Varnish-provided apt repository 
to have access to the latest versions of Varnish:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata to add the dependency on the varnish cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "varnish"
If you don't have the apt cookbook in your node's run list (which you should), 
you need include_recipe "apt" in your cookbook's default recipe.
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
3.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
include_recipe 'apt'
varnish_install "webapp" do
  vendor_repo true
end
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:

INFO: service[varnish] restarted
    - restart service service[varnish]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate whether your Varnish cache is up and running by hitting your node at port 
6081:
user@server:~$ wget localhost:6081
2015-02-27 23:39:41 (16.4 MB/s) - `index.html' saved [14900]
How it works...
As we want to use the latest version of Varnish (and not the usually outdated one from the 
default Ubuntu package repository), we ask the varnish_install resource to use the 
original apt repository provided by Varnish by setting vendor_repo to true:
varnish_install "webapp" do
  vendor_repo true
end
This call will install, configure, and start the Varnish server listening to its default port 6081.
There's more...
If you want to build your own configuration file instead of the default one provided by the apt 
package, you can use varnish_default_config in your recipe.
You can change the backend host Varnish uses, as shown in the following code:
varnish_default_vcl do
  backend_host 'webapp.example.com'
  backend_port 8000
end
Use varnish_log to change varnish's log settings.
You can connect to the Varnish admin interface by logging in to your node and running telnet:
user@server:~$ sudo telnet localhost 6082

Managing your local workstation
You know the drill. You get a brand new MacBook and need to set up all your software—again. 
Chef can help here, too.
We will take a look at how to install applications and tweak settings on your local development 
box with Chef.
This example is based on recipes for OS X only, but you can tweak it to run 
on Windows or Linux, too.
Getting ready
First, we need to prepare our own repository for our individual setup:
1.	 Fork the github.com/mmarschall/kitchenplan-config repository:
2.	 Clone it to your local development box, replacing <YOUR GITHUB USER> with the 
name of your GitHub account:

Let's set up Kitchenplan to use a few readymade recipes:
1.	 Make sure you have a configuration for your user that tells Kitchenplan what to install 
on your box:
mma@laptop:~/kitchenplan-config $ subl config/people/<YOUR OSX 
USER>.yml
recipes:
    global:
    mac_os_x:

attributes:
    homebrewalt:
        cask_apps:
            - free-ruler
2.	 Commit and push your changes to your kitchenplan-config repository:
mma@laptop:~/kitchenplan-config $ git add config/people/<YOUR OSX 
USER>.yml
mma@laptop:~/kitchenplan-config $ git commit -a -m "initial 
config"
mma@laptop:~/kitchenplan-config $ git push origin master
3.	 Set up Kitchenplan on your development box. Choose y when asked whether 
you have a config repository and provide the GitHub URL of your kitchenplan-
config repository:
mma@laptop:~/kitchenplan-config $ kitchenplan setup
Do you have a config repository? [y,n] y

5.	 Now, your dock should be located at the left-hand side of the screen and the 
application Free Ruler should show up in your Applications folder.
How it works...
Kitchenplan is a quick and easy way to configure your box. It uses Librarian and Chef solo to 
manage cookbooks. That's why Kitchenplan still uses Chef 11 at the time of writing this book.
Kitchenplan setup puts everything it needs into the /opt/kitchenplan directory. It will 
check out your kitchenplan-config repository and run Chef solo from there.

You can configure what to install in YAML files that are placed in the config directory of your 
kitchenplan-config repository. You can configure OS X using the mac_os_x recipe and 
you can install applications using homebrew by listing them in the attributes section of 
your config file:
recipes:
    global:
    mac_os_x:
        - osxdefaults::dock_position_the_dock_on_the_left_side
attributes:
    homebrewalt:
        cask_apps:
            - free-ruler
Kitchenplan will use Librarian to install all cookbooks defined in Cheffile which is located 
in your kitchenplan-config repository and then converge all recipes listed in your YAML 
files. Before converging, it will set all the given node attributes that will be used by the recipes.
There's more...
You can create various config files for your users and groups, and a default.yml. 
Kitchenplan will merge all YAML files before provisioning your box using the currently 
logged in username to find the correct file in the config/people directory.

Introduction
In the preceding chapters, we mostly looked at individual nodes. Now, it's time to consider 
your infrastructure as a whole. We'll see how to manage services spanning multiple machines, 
such as load balancers, and how to manage the networking aspects of your infrastructure.
Creating your infrastructure using Chef 
Provisioning
You know how to use Chef to manage the software on individual machines and you know 
how to use knife to bootstrap individual nodes. Chef Provisioning helps you to use the power 
of Chef to create your whole infrastructure for you.
No matter whether you want to create a cluster of Vagrant boxes, Docker instances, 
or Cloud servers, Chef Provisioning lets you define your infrastructure in a simple recipe 
and run it idempotently.
Let's see how to create a Vagrant machine using a Chef recipe.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have your Berksfile, my_cookbook and web_server roles ready to 
create an nginx site, as described in Creating nginx virtual hosts section in chapter 6, Users 
and Applications.
How to do it...
Let's see how to create a Vagrant machine and install nginx on it:
1.	 Describe your Vagrant machine in a recipe called mycluster.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl mycluster.rb
require 'chef/provisioning'
with_driver 'vagrant'
with_machine_options :vagrant_options => { 'vm.box' => 'opscode-
ubuntu-14.04' }
machine 'web01' do
  role 'web_server'
end

2.	 Install all required cookbooks in your local chef-repo:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks vendor cookbooks

3.	 Run the Chef client in local mode to bring up the Vagrant machine and execute a 
Chef run on it:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef-client -z mycluster.rb

5.	 Validate that there is a Vagrant machine named web01 running:
mma@laptop:~/.chef/vms $ vagrant status
Current machine states:
web01                 running (virtualbox)
6.	 Validate that nginx is installed and running on the Vagrant machine:

How it works...
Chef Provisioning comes with a selection of drivers for all kinds of infrastructures, including 
Fog (supporting Amazon EC2, OpenStack, and others), VMware VSphere, Vagrant (supporting 
Virtualbox and VMware Fusion), various Containers, such as LXC Docker and Secure Shell (SSH).
In this recipe, we make sure that we can use the directives provided by Chef Provisioning 
by requiring chef/provisioning library.
Then, we configure the driver that we want to use. We use Vagrant and tell Chef to use the 
opscode-ubuntu-14.04 Vagrant box to spin up our machine.
Using the machine resource, we ask Chef to spin up a Vagrant machine and configure it 
using Chef by applying the role web_server.
The web_server role uses the cookbook my_cookbook to configure the newly created 
Vagrant machine. To make sure that all the required cookbooks are available to Chef, we 
use berks install and berks vendor cookbooks. The berks vendor cookbooks 
installs all the required cookbooks in the local cookbooks directory. The Chef client can 
access the cookbooks here, without the need for a Chef server.
Finally, we use the Chef client to execute our Chef Provisioning recipe. It will spin up the 
defined Vagrant machine and execute a Chef client run on it.
Chef Provisioning will put the Vagrant Virtual Machine (VM) definition into the directory 
~/.chef/vms. To manage the Vagrant VM, you need to change to this directory.

There's more...
Instead of using the with_driver directive, you can use the CHEF_DRIVER 
environment variable:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ CHEF_DRIVER=vagrant chef-client -z 
mycluster.rb
You can create multiple instances of a machine by using the machine_image directive in 
your recipe:
machine_image 'web_server' do
  role 'web_server'
end
1.upto(2) do |i|
  machine "web0#{i}" do
    from_image 'web_server'
  end
end

Creating cookbooks from a running system 
with Blueprint
Everyone has it: that one server in the corner of the data center, which no one dares to touch 
anymore. It's like a precious snowflake: unique and infinitely fragile. How do you get such a 
server under configuration management?
Blueprint is a tool that can find out exactly what's on your server. It records all directories, 
packages, configuration files, and so on.

Blueprint can spit out that information about your server in various formats; one of them is a 
Chef recipe. You can use such a generated Chef recipe as a basis to rebuild that one unique 
snowflake server.
Let's see how to do that.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have Python and Git installed on the node that you want to run Blueprint 
on. Install Python and Git by running the following command:
user@server:~$ sudo apt-get install git python python-pip
How to do it...
Let's see how to install Blueprint and create a Chef cookbook for our node:
1.	 Install Blueprint using the following command:
user@server:~$ sudo pip install blueprint
2.	 Configure Git:
user@server:~$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"
user@server:~$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
3.	 Run Blueprint. Replace my-server with any name you want to use for your Blueprint. 
This name will become the name of the cookbook in the following step:
user@server:~$ sudo blueprint create my-server
# [blueprint] caching excluded APT packages
# [blueprint] searching for Yum packages to exclude
# [blueprint] parsing blueprintignore(5) rules
# [blueprint] searching for Python packages

4.	 Create a Chef cookbook from your blueprint:
user@server:~$ blueprint show -C my-server
my-server/recipes/default.rb
5.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
user@server:~$ cat my-server/recipes/default.rb
#
# Automatically generated by blueprint(7).  Edit at your own risk.
#
directory('/etc/apt/apt.conf.d') do
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  owner 'root'
  recursive true
end

service('ssh') do
  action [:enable, :start]

common]', 'cookbook_file[/etc/default/ntfs-3g]', 'cookbook_file[/
etc/default/keyboard]', 'cookbook_file[/etc/pam.d/common-session-
noninteractive]', 'cookbook_file[/etc/default/console-setup]', 
'cookbook_file[/etc/pam.d/common-auth]', 'cookbook_file[/etc/
pam.d/common-session]', 'package[openssh-server]')
end
How it works...
Blueprint is a Python package, which finds out all the relevant configuration data of your 
node and stores it in a Git repository. Each Blueprint has its own name.
You can ask Blueprint to show the contents of its Git repository in various formats. 
Using the -C flag to the blueprint show command creates a Chef cookbook containing 
everything you need in that cookbook's default recipe. It stores the cookbook in the directory 
from where you run Blueprint and uses the Blueprint name as the cookbook name, as shown 
in the following code:
user@server:~$ ls -l my-server/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 3 vagrant vagrant 4096 Mar  5 06:01 files
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    0 Mar  5 06:01 metadata.rb

The preceding command shows all kinds of installed packages. Other show commands 
are as follows:
f

Blueprint can output your server configuration as a shell script, as shown in the following 
command line:
user@server:~$ blueprint show -S my-server
You can use this script as a basis for a knife bootstrap as described in the Using custom 
bootstrap scripts recipe in this chapter.

Running the same command on many 
machines at once
A simple problem with so many self-scripted solutions is logging in to multiple boxes in parallel, 
executing the same command on every box at once. No matter whether you want to check the 
status of a certain service or look at some critical system data on all boxes, being able to log in 
to many servers in parallel can save you a lot of time and hassle (imagine forgetting one of your 
seven web servers when disabling the basic authentication for your website).

Chapter 7
221
How to do it...
Let's try to execute a few simple commands on multiple servers in parallel:
1.	 Retrieve the status of the nginx processes from all your web servers (assuming 
you have at least one host up and running, which has the role web_server):
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife ssh 'role:web_server' 'sudo sv 
status nginx'
www1.prod.example.com run: nginx: (pid 12356) 204667s; run: 
log: (pid 1135) 912026s
www2.prod.example.com run: nginx: (pid 19155) 199923s; run: 
log: (pid 1138) 834124s
www.test.example.com  run: nginx: (pid 30299) 1332114s; 
run: log: (pid 30271) 1332117s
2.	 Display the uptime of all your nodes in your staging environment running on 
Amazon EC2:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife ssh 'chef_environment:staging AND 
ec2:*' uptime
ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com  
21:58:15 up 23 days, 13:19,  1 user,  load average: 1.32, 
1.88, 2.34
ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com  
21:58:15 up 10 days, 13:19,  1 user,  load average: 1.51, 
1.52, 1.54
How it works...
First, you have to specify a query to find your nodes. It is usually a good idea to test your 
queries by running a command such as uptime (instead of dangerous commands such 
as sudo restart now). Your query will obviously use the node index and the complete 
knife search query syntax is available.
Knife will run a search and connect to each node found executing the given command on 
every single one. It will collect and display all outputs received by the nodes.
There's more...
You can open terminals to all the nodes identified by your query by using either tmux or 
screen as commands.

If you don't want to use a search query, you can list the desired nodes using the -m option:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife ssh -m 'www1.prod.example.com www2.prod.
example.com' uptime
www1.prod.example.com  22:10:00 up 9 days, 16:00,  1 user,  load 
average: 0.44, 0.40, 0.38
www2.prod.example.com     22:10:00 up 15 days, 10:28,  1 user,  
load average: 0.02, 0.05, 0.06

Setting up SNMP for external monitoring 
services
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the standard way to monitor all your 
network devices. You can use Chef to install the SNMP service on your node and configure 
it to match your needs.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks, section in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create your Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
How to do it...
Let's change some attributes and install SNMP on our node:
1.	 Add the dependency on the snmp cookbook to your cookbook's metadata.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
depends "snmp"

3.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
node.default['snmp']['syslocationVirtual'] = "Vagrant VirtualBox"
node.default['snmp']['syslocationPhysical'] = "My laptop"
node.default['snmp']['full_systemview'] = true
include_recipe "snmp"
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks upload
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Uploaded snmp (3.0.1) to: 'https://api.opscode.com:443/
organizations/awo'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
   - restart service service[snmpd]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate that you can query snmpd:
user@server:~$ snmpwalk -v 1 localhost -c public 
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "vagrant"
How it works...
First, we need to tell our cookbook that we want to use the snmp cookbook by adding a 
depends call to our metadata file. Then, we modify some of the attributes provided by the 
snmp cookbook. The attributes are used to fill the /etc/snmp/snmp.conf file, which is 
based on the template provided by the snmp cookbook.
The last step is to include the snmp cookbook's default recipe in our own recipe. This will 
instruct the Chef client to install snmpd as a service on our node.

Deploying a Nagios monitoring server
Nagios is one of the most widely spread monitoring packages available. Chef provides you 
with a cookbook to install a Nagios server, as well as Nagios clients. It provides ways to 
configure service checks, service groups and so on, using data bags instead of manually 
editing Nagios configuration files.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure:
1.	 Create your Berksfile in your Chef repository including the nagios cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'resource-control'
cookbook 'nagios'
2.	 Install the nagios cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install

How to do it...
Let's create a user (called mma in the following example) for the Nagios web interface and set 
up a Nagios server with a check for SSH.
1.	 Create a password hash for your Nagios user:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ htpasswd -n -s mma
New password:
Re-type new password:
mma:{SHA}AcrFI+aFqjxDLBKctCtzW/LkVxg=
You may want to use an online htpasswd generator such as http://
www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/, if you don't have 
htpasswd installed on your system.
2.	 Create a data bag for your Nagios user, using the password hash from the preceding 
step. Further, we use mma as the username and mm@agilweboperations.com as 
the e-mail address. Please use your username and email address instead of mine:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/users/mma.json
{
  "id": "mma",
  "htpasswd": "{SHA}AcrFI+aFqjxDLBKctCtzW/LkVxg=",
  "groups": "sysadmin",
  "nagios": {
    "email": "mm@agileweboperations.com"
  }
}
3.	 Upload the user data bag to your Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file users mma.json
Updated data_bag_item[users::mma]
4.	 Create a data bag for your service definitions:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag create nagios_services
Created data_bag_item[nagios_service]
5.	 Create a data bag item for your first service:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir -p data_bags/nagios_services
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl data_bags/nagios_services/ssh.json

{
  "id": "ssh",
  "hostgroup_name": "linux",
  "command_line": "$USER1$/check_ssh $HOSTADDRESS$"
}
6.	 Upload your service data bag item:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife data bag from file nagios_services 
ssh.json
Updated data_bag_item[nagios_services::ssh]
7.	
Create a role for your Nagios server node:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl roles/monitoring.rb
name "monitoring"
description "Nagios server"
run_list(
  "recipe[apt]",
  "recipe[nagios::default]"
)
default_attributes(
  "nagios" => {
    "server_auth_method" => "htauth"
  },
  "apache" => {
  "mpm" => "prefork"
  }
)
8.	 Upload your monitoring role to your Chef server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife role from file monitoring.rb
Updated Role monitoring!
9.	 Apply the monitoring role to your node called server:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife node run_list set server 
'role[monitoring]'
server:
  run_list: role[monitoring]
10.	 Run the Chef client on your node:

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
11.	 Validate the Nagios web interface by navigating to your node on port 80. Use the 
user/password combination that you set for your user in the user's data bag:
How it works...
First, we set up a user to manage the Nagios web interface. We create a data bag called 
users and a data bag item for your user (in the preceding example, the user is called mma. 
You will change that to the username you desire).
By default, Nagios will set up web access for every user in the sysadmins group, which 
has a Nagios email address defined in the data bag.
As we want to use HTTP basic authentication for the Nagios web interface, we need to 
create a password hash to put into our user data bag.
To make Nagios use HTTP basic authentication, we need to set the server_auth_method 
attribute to htauth when defining the monitoring role, which we assign to our node.
Then, we configure a service check for SSH using a default template for the Nagios 
configuration file. To do so, we create a data bag and data bag item for our service.

Finally, we run the Chef client on our node and validate that we can log in with our user/
password to the Nagios web frontend running on our node, and make sure that the SSH 
service check is running.
There's more...
You can change the default group to choose users for the Nagios web interface by modifying 
the ['nagios']['users_databag_group'] attribute in the role you use to configure 
your Nagios server.
You can set up your checks using your own templates and you can configure the contact 
groups and so on.

Building high-availability services using 
heartbeat
If you want to offer any IP-based service with automatic failover to provide high availability 
(HA), you can use heartbeat to create an HA cluster.
Heartbeat will run on two or more nodes and ensure that the IP address you chose to make 
highly available will switch to a working node, if one of them goes down. This way, you have a 
failover IP address, which is guaranteed to reach a running host, as long as there is one left.
Let's take a look at how to install heartbeat on your nodes and configure it with a failover 
IP address.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have two machines, named ha1 and ha2, up and running. You can use a

Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and run_list of all the nodes 
you want to add to your HA cluster, including my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and

How to do it...
Let's use the community-provided heartbeat cookbook and configure it to work with 
our nodes:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb to add the dependency to the heartbeat 
cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
depends 'apt'
depends "heartbeat"
Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
2.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe, replacing 192.168.0.100 with the IP address, 
which should be highly available (your failover IP address) and eth1 with the network 
interface that you want to use:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
include_recipe "apt"
include_recipe "heartbeat"
heartbeat "heartbeat" do
  authkeys "MySecrectAuthPassword"
  autojoin "none"
  warntime 5
  deadtime 15
  initdead 60
  keepalive 2
  logfacility "syslog"
  interface "eth1"
  mode "bcast"
  udpport 694
  auto_failback true
  resources "192.168.0.100"
  search "name:ha*"

* service[heartbeat] action restart[2015-03-14T22:02:26+00:00] 
INFO: service[heartbeat] restarted
    - restart service service[heartbeat]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
5.	 Validate that your first node holds the failover IP address:
user@ha1:~$ ifconfig -a
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:12:7b:fc
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...

How it works...
The heartbeat cookbook installs the heartbeat service on all your nodes. In this example, 
we assume that your hostnames are ha1, ha2, and so on.
Then, we need to configure our HA cluster. In the preceding example, we do this within 
our recipe.
First, you need to define a password. The nodes will use this password to authenticate 
themselves to each other.
Setting autojoin to none will make it impossible that new nodes get added outside of 
your Chef client runs.
Next, we set the timeouts to tell heartbeat when to act, if something seems wrong. The 
timeouts are given in seconds.
In the preceding example, we ask heartbeat to use the broadcast method on the network 
interface eth1.
The resources is your failover IP address. This IP address will be highly available in 
your setup.
The search call contains the query to find all the nodes to be included in the heartbeat 
setup. In our example, we search for nodes with names starting with ha.
After uploading all cookbooks and running the Chef client, we can verify our setup by 
querying the heartbeat status on both the nodes.
By stopping the heartbeat service on the node that currently has the failover IP address 
assigned to it, the second node will take over automatically.

You can configure the heartbeat by setting attributes in a role as well. In this case, it would 
make sense to set the search attribute to find all the nodes that have the role.

Using HAProxy to load-balance multiple web 
servers
You have a successful website and it is time to scale out to multiple web servers to support 
it. HAProxy is a very fast and reliable load-balancer and proxy for TCP- and HTTP-based 
applications.
You can put it in front of your web servers and let it distribute the load. If you configure it on 
an HA cluster by using heartbeat (see the Building high-availability services using heartbeat 
recipe in this chapter), you have a complete high-availability solution available.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have at least one node registered on your Chef server with the role 
web_server in its run list. The following example will set up HAProxy so that it routes 
all requests to all your nodes that have the web_server role.
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create your Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'

How to do it...
Let's see how to set up a simple HAProxy balancing to all nodes that have the 
web_server role:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
depends "haproxy"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
3.	 Edit your cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
node.default['haproxy']['httpchk'] = true
node.default['haproxy']['x_forwarded_for'] = true
node.default['haproxy']['app_server_role'] = "web_server"
include_recipe "haproxy::app_lb"
include_recipe "haproxy::default"
4.	 Upload the modified cookbook to the Chef server:

Chapter 7
235
6.	 Validate that the HAproxy admin interface runs on your node on port 22002:
How it works...
First, we change some of the default values: setting httpchk to true makes sure that 
HAProxy takes backend servers out of the cluster, if they don't respond anymore.
The x_forwarded_for attribute tells HAProxy to set the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. 
It will contain the client IP address. If you don't set that header, your web servers will only 
see the IP address of your HAProxy server in their access logs, instead of your client's IP 
addresses. This will make it very difficult to debug problems with your web applications.
The third attribute that we need to change is app_server_role. You can set whatever 
role your backend application servers have. The haproxy cookbook will include every node 
(using its ipaddress node attribute, as returned by Ohai) having this role within its cluster.
After overriding those attributes, we run the app_lb recipe from the haproxy cookbook. 
The app_lb recipe will install HAProxy from a package and run a search for all nodes 
having the configured role.

After uploading all cookbooks and running the Chef client, you'll find the HAProxy admin 
interface on your node at port 22002. Hitting your HAProxy node at port 80 will forward 
your request to one of your web servers.

Using custom bootstrap scripts
While creating a new node, you need to make sure that it has Chef installed on it. Knife offers 
the bootstrap subcommand to connect to a node via Secure Shell (SSH) and run a bootstrap 
script on the node.
The bootstrap script should install the Chef client on your node and register the node with 
your Chef server. Chef comes with a few default bootstrap scripts for various platforms. There 
are options to install the Chef client using the Omnibus installer packages, or Ruby gems.
If you want to modify the way your Chef client gets installed on your nodes, you can create 
and use custom bootstrap scripts.
Let's take a look at how to do this.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a node that is ready to become a Chef client and can SSH into it. 
In the following example, we'll assume that you have a username and password to log in to 
your node.
How to do it...
Let's see how to execute our custom bootstrap script with knife to make our node a Chef client:
1.	 Create your basic bootstrap script from one of the existing Chef scripts:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ mkdir bootstrap

www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

--:--:-- 23287
2.	 Edit your custom bootstrap script:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl bootstrap/my-chef-full.erb
mkdir -p /etc/chef
cat > /etc/chef/greeting.txt <<'EOP'
Ohai, Chef!
EOP
3.	 Bootstrap your node using your modified custom bootstrap script. Replace 
192.168.0.100 with the IP address of your node and user with your SSH username:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife bootstrap 192.168.0.100 -x user 
--template-file bootstrap/my-chef-full.erb --sudo
192.168.0.100 [2015-03-21T15:30:44+00:00] WARN: Node bootstrapped 
has an empty run list.
4.	 Validate the content of the generated file:
user@server:~$ cat /etc/chef/greeting.txt
Ohai, Chef!
How it works...
The chef-full.erb bootstrap script uses the Omnibus installer to install the Chef client 
and all its dependencies onto your node. It comes packaged with all the dependencies so 
that you don't need to install a separate Ruby or additional gems on your node.
First, we download the bootstrap script as part of Chef. Then, we customize it as we like. Our 
example of putting an additional text file is trivial so feel free to change it to whenever you need.
After changing our custom bootstrap script, we're only one command away from a fully 
bootstrapped Chef node.

238
If you want to bootstrap a virtual machine like Vagrant to test 
your bootstrap script, you might need to use localhost as the 
node's IP address, and add -p 2222 to your command line to 
tell knife to connect through the forwarded SSH port of your VM.
There's more...
If you already know the role your node should play or which recipes you want to run on your 
node, you can add a run list to your bootstrapping call:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife bootstrap 192.168.0.100 -x user 
--template-file bootstrap/my-chef-full.erb --sudo -r 'role[web_server]'
Here, we added the web_server role to the run the list of the nodes with the -r parameter.

Managing firewalls with iptables
Securing your servers is very important. One basic way of shutting down quite a few attack 
vectors is running a firewall on your nodes. The firewall will make sure that only those network 
connections that hit the services you decide to allow are accepted.
On Ubuntu, iptables is one of the tools available for the job. Let's see how to set it up to 
make your servers more secure.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook called my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Create your Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'

Chapter 7
239
How to do it...
Let's set up iptables so that it blocks all network connections to your node and only accepts 
connections to the SSH and HTTP ports:
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
depends "iptables"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install
Using my_cookbook (0.1.0) at './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
3.	 Edit your own cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
include_recipe "iptables"
iptables_rule "ssh"
iptables_rule "http"
execute "ensure iptables is activated" do
  command "/usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables"
  creates "/etc/iptables/general"
  action :run
end
4.	 Create a template for the SSH rule:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/ssh.erb
# Allow ssh access to default port
-A FWR -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
5.	 Create a template for the HTTP rule:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/templates/
default/http.erb
-A FWR -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Uploading my_cookbook (0.1.0) to: 'https://api.chef.io:443/
organizations/awo'
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
7.	
Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Recipe: iptables::default
  * execute[rebuild-iptables] action run
    - execute /usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
8.	 Validate that the iptables rules have been loaded:
user@server:~$ sudo iptables -L
Chain FWR (1 references)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             
state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp 
dpt:http
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp 
dpt:ssh
REJECT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp 
flags:SYN,RST,ACK/SYN reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
REJECT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             
reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
How it works...
First, we download the iptables cookbook from the Chef community site.
Then, we modify our own cookbook to install iptables. This will set it up in such a way 
that all network connections are refused by default.
To be able to access the node via SSH afterwards, we need to open up port 22. To do so, 
we create the my_cookbook/templates/default/ssh.erb template and include the 
required iptables rule.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 7
241
We do the same for port 80 to accept HTTP traffic on our node.
The iptables cookbook will drop off those templates in /etc/iptables.d and configure 
iptables so that it loads all those files on startup. It installs the script rebuild-iptables 
to do this.
Finally, we make sure that iptables has been activated. We add this step because I saw 
that the iptables cookbook ran, but did not load all the rules. This is fatal because you 
deem your box secured, whereas in fact, it is wide open.
After doing all our modifications, we upload all cookbooks and run the Chef client on our node.
We can validate whether iptables runs by listing all the active rules with the -L parameter 
to an iptables call on our node. You see the ACCEPT lines for ports http and ssh. That's a 
good sign. The last two lines shut down all other services.

Managing fail2ban to ban malicious IP 
addresses
Brute-force attacks against any of your password protected services, such as SSH, and 
break-in attempts against your web server happen frequently for every public-facing system.
The fail2ban tool monitors your log files and acts as soon as it discovers malicious behavior 
in the way you told it to. One common use case is blocking malicious IP addresses by 
establishing firewall rules on the fly using iptables.
In this section, we'll take a look at how to set up a basic protection for by SSH using 
fail2ban and iptables.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have a cookbook named my_cookbook and that the run_list of your 
node includes my_cookbook, as described in the Creating and using cookbooks recipe in 
Chapter 1, Chef Infrastructure.
Make sure that you have created the ssh.erb template for your iptables rule as described 
in the Managing firewalls with iptables recipe in this chapter.

Create your Berksfile in your Chef repository including my_cookbook:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl Berksfile
cookbook 'my_cookbook', path: './cookbooks/my_cookbook'
How to do it...
Let's install fail2ban and create a local configuration by enabling one additional rule to 
protect your node against SSH DDos attacks. This approach is easily extensible for various 
additional services.
1.	 Edit your cookbook's metadata.rb:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/metadata.rb
...
depends "iptables"
depends "fail2ban"
2.	 Install your cookbook's dependencies:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ berks install

...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
3.	 Edit your own cookbook's default recipe:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ subl cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/
default.rb
include_recipe "iptables"
iptables_rule "ssh"
node.default['fail2ban']['services'] = {
  'ssh-ddos' => {
        "enabled" => "true",
        "port" => "ssh",
        "filter" => "sshd-ddos",
        "logpath" => node['fail2ban']['auth_log'],
        "maxretry" => "6"
     }
}
include_recipe "fail2ban"

5.	 Run the Chef client on your node:
user@server:~$ sudo chef-client
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
  * service[fail2ban] action restart
    - restart service service[fail2ban]
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
6.	 Validate that your local fail2ban configuration has been created:
user@server:~$ cat /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[ssh-ddos]
enabled  = true
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
How it works...
First, we need to install iptables because we want fail2ban to create iptables rules to block 
malicious IP addresses. Then, we pull the fail2ban cookbook down to our local 
Chef repository.
In our cookbook's default recipe, we install iptables.
Then, we define a custom configuration for fail2ban to enable the ssh-ddos protection. fail2ban 
requires you to put your customizations into a file called /etc/fail2ban/jail.local.
Then, we install fail2ban.
It first loads /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf and then loads jail.local overriding the 
jail.conf settings. This way, setting enabled=true for the ssh-ddos section in jail.
local will enable that section after restarting the fail2ban service.
There's more...
Usually, you want to add the recipe with the fail2ban configuration to a base role, which you 
apply to all nodes.
You can add more sections to the ['fail2ban']['services'] attribute hash, as needed.

Managing Amazon EC2 instances
Amazon Web Services (AWS) includes the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you 
can start virtual machines running in the Cloud. In this section, we will use Chef to start a new 
EC2 instance and bootstrap the Chef client on it.
Getting ready
Make sure that you have an account at AWS.
To be able to manage EC2 instances with knife, you need security credentials. It's a good 
idea to create a new user in the AWS Management Console using AWS Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) as shown in the following document: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/
IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_SettingUpUser.html
Note down your new user's AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key.
Additionally, you will need to create a SSH key pair and download the private key to enable 
knife to access your node via SSH.
To create a key pair, log in to AWS Console and navigate to EC2 service (https://console.
aws.amazon.com/ec2/home). Then, choose Key Pairs under the Network & Security 
section in the navigation. Click on the Create Key Pair button and enter aws_knife_key as 
the name. Store the downloaded aws_knife_key.pem private key in your ~/.ssh directory.
How to do it...
Let's use the knife-ec2 plugin to instantiate and bootstrap an EC2 node with Ubuntu 14.04 
in the following way:
1.	 Install the knife-ec2 plugin to be able to use the AWS API via knife:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef gem install knife-ec2
Fetching: knife-ec2-0.10.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed knife-ec2-0.10.0
1 gem installed

2.	 Create your EC2 instance:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife ec2 server create -d 'chef-full' 
-r 'recipe[apt]' -S 'aws_knife_key' -x ubuntu -i ~/.ssh/aws_knife_
key.pem -I 'ami-fc99c294' -f 'm1.small' -A 'Your AWS Access Key 
ID' -K 'Your AWS Secret Access Key'

You need to look up the most current AMI ID for your node at http://
cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/ and use it in your knife 
call, instead of ami-fc99c294. See the following How it works... section 
for more details about how to identify the correct AMI.
3.	 Log in to your new EC2 instance:

How it works...
First, we need to install the EC2 plugin for knife. It comes as a Ruby gem.
Then, we need to make a few decisions on which type of EC2 instance we want to launch 
and where it should run:
1.	 Decide on the node size. You'll find a complete list of all the available instance types 
at the following location: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/. In 
this example, we'll just spin up a small instance (m1.small).
2.	 Choose the Region to run your node in. We use the AWS default region US East 
(Northern Virginia) in this example. The shorthand name for it is us-east-1.
3.	 Find the correct Amazon Machine Image (AMI) by navigating to http://cloud-
images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/ and selecting the desired one based on the 
Availability Zone, the Ubuntu version, the CPU architecture, and the desired storage 
mode. In this example, we'll use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS code named 
trusty, using instance-store. At the time of writing this, the most current version was 
ami-fc99c294.
As soon as you know what you want to achieve, it's time to construct the launch command. 
It consists of the following parts:
The knife-ec2 plugin adds a few subcommands to knife. We use the ec2 server create 
subcommand to start a new EC2 instance.
The initial parameters we will use to deal with the desired Chef client setup are as follows:
f
f
-d 'chef-full': This asks knife to use the bootstrap script for the Omnibus 
installer. It is described in more detail in the Using custom bootstrap scripts recipe 
in this chapter.
f
f
-r 'recipe[apt]': It defines the run list. In this case, we install and run the apt 
cookbook to automatically update the package cache during the first Chef client run.
The second group of parameters deals with SSH access to the newly created instance:
f
f
-S 'aws_knife_key': This lists the name of the SSH key pair you want to use to 
access the new node. This is the name you defined in the AWS console while creating 
the SSH key pair.
f
f
-x ubuntu: This is the SSH username. If you use a default Ubuntu AMI, it is usually 
ubuntu
f
f
-i ~/.ssh/aws_knife_key.pem: This is your private SSH key, which you 
downloaded after creating your SSH key pair in the AWS console
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 7
247
The third set of parameters deals with the AWS API:
f
f
-I 'ami-fc99c294': This names the AMI ID. You need to take the latest one, 
as described in the preceding paragraph.
f
f
-f 'm1.small': This is the instance type, as described in the preceding point
f
f
-A 'Your AWS Access Key ID': This is the ID of your IAM user's AWS Access 
Key
f
f
-K 'Your AWS Secret Access Key': This is the secret part of your IAM user's 
AWS Access Key
The AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key are the security 
credentials of a user, who is allowed to use the AWS API. You create such 
users in the IAM section of the AWS management console.
The SSH key pair is there to secure the access to your nodes. By defining 
the name of the key pair in the knife command, the public key of your SSH 
key pair will be installed for the SSH user on your new node. You create such 
SSH key pairs in the EC2 section of the AWS management console.
The command will now start a new EC2 instance via the AWS API using your AWS credentials. 
Then, it will log in using the given SSH user and key and run the given bootstrap script on 
your new node to make it a working Chef client and register it with your Chef server.
There's more...
Instead of adding your AWS credentials to the command line (which is unsafe as they will 
end up in your shell history), you can put them into your knife.rb:
knife[:aws_access_key_id]  = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"
Instead of hard coding it there, you can even use environment variables to configure knife:
knife[:aws_access_key_id] = ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
Never expose your knife.rb file to a public Git repository!

The knife-ec2 plugin offers additional subcommands. You can list them by just typing the 
following command line:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ knife ec2
** EC2 COMMANDS **
knife ec2 flavor list (options)
knife ec2 instance data (options)
knife ec2 server create (options)
knife ec2 server delete SERVER [SERVER] (options)

Loading your Chef infrastructure from a file 
with spiceweasel and knife
Having all your cookbooks, roles, and data bags as code under version control is great, but 
having your repository alone is not enough to be able to spin up your complete environment 
from scratch again. Starting from the repository alone, you will need to spin up nodes, upload 
cookbooks to your Chef server, and recreate data bags there.
Especially when you use a Cloud provider to spin up your nodes, it would be great if you 
could spin up your nodes automatically and hook them up to your freshly created and filled 
Chef server.
The spiceweasel tool lets you define all your cookbooks, data bags, and nodes, and generates 
all the necessary knife commands to recreate your complete environment, including spinning 
up nodes and populating your empty Chef server or organization on the hosted Chef.
Let's see how to dump our current repository to spiceweasel and how to recreate our 
infrastructure with it.
Getting ready
Make sure that you are able to spin up Amazon EC2 instances using knife, as described in 
the Managing Amazon EC2 instances section in this chapter.

How to do it...
Let's use spiceweasel to dump our current configuration, add some EC2 nodes and 
recreate our complete environment:
1.	 Install the spiceweasel Ruby gem:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ chef gem install spiceweasel
Fetching: spiceweasel-2.8.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed spiceweasel-2.8.0
1 gem installed
2.	 Let spiceweasel dump your current repository into a infrastructure.yml file:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ spiceweasel --extractyaml > 
infrastructure.yml
3.	 Look into your new infrastructure.yml file (the contents depend on the current 
state of your Chef repository):
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ cat infrastructure.yml
---
berksfile:
cookbooks:
- apt:
    version: 2.6.1
- heartbeat:
    version: 1.0.0
roles:
- monitoring:
- web_server:
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
4.	 Print all the knife commands and spiceweasel will run:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ spiceweasel infrastructure.yml
berks upload -b ./Berksfile
knife cookbook upload apt heartbeat
knife role from file monitoring.rb web_server.json
knife data bag create accounts
knife data bag from file accounts google.json
knife data bag create hooks

knife data bag create nagios_services

knife data bag from file nagios_services ssh.json
knife data bag create users
knife data bag from file users mma.json
5.	 Let spiceweasel run the knife commands, as follows:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ spiceweasel -e infrastructure.yml
...TRUNCATED OUTPUT...
Data bag users already exists
Updated data_bag_item[users::mma]
How it works...
The spiceweasel tool scans your local Chef repository and notes down everything as a 
YAML file.
When reading a YAML file, it generates knife commands to make the contents of the 
Chef repository available on the Chef server.
There's more...
You can define nodes in your infrastructure.yml file either as local nodes, which 
spiceweasel will then bootstrap, or nodes for cloud providers. spiceweasel will then 
create knife <provider> server create commands for each specified node.
Using nodes in your infrastructure.yml file enables you to recreate a complete 
environment, including all the necessary VMs using spiceweasel.
You can use spiceweasel to delete your setup from your Chef server by using the --delete 
flag when running spiceweasel:
mma@laptop:~/chef-repo $ spiceweasel --delete infrastructure.yml
