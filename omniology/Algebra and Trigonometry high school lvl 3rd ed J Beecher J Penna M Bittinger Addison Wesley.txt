Real Numbers
In applications of algebraic concepts, we use real numbers to represent
quantities such as distance, time, speed, area, profit, loss, and tempera-
ture. Some frequently used sets of real numbers and the relationships
among them are shown below.

The real numbers that are not rational are irrational numbers. Decimal
notation for irrational numbers neither terminates nor repeats. Each of the
following is an irrational number.
a)
There is no repeating block of digits.
and 3.14 are rational approximations of the irrational number 
b)
There is no repeating block of digits.
c)
Although there is a pattern, there is no 
repeating block of digits.
The set of all rational numbers combined with the set of all irrational
numbers gives us the set of real numbers. The real numbers are modeled
using a number line, as shown below.
Each point on the line represents a real number, and every real number
is represented by a point on the line.
The order of the real numbers can be determined from the number
line. If a number a is to the left of a number b, then a is less than b
. Similarly, a is greater than b
if a is to the right of b on
the number line. For example, we see from the number line above that
, because 2.9 is to the left of
. Also,
, because 
is to the right of
.
The statement 
, read “a is less than or equal to b,” is true if either
is true or 
is true.
The symbol  is used to indicate that a member, or element, belongs to
a set. Thus if we let 
represent the set of rational numbers, we can see from
the diagram on page 2 that 
. We can also write 
to indi-
cate that 
is not an element of the set of rational numbers.
When all the elements of one set are elements of a second set, we say that
the first set is a subset of the second set. The symbol  is used to denote this.
For instance, if we let 
represent the set of real numbers, we can see from
the diagram that 
(read “
is a subset of
”).
Interval Notation
Sets of real numbers can be expressed using interval notation. For example,
for real numbers a and b such that 
, the open interval
is the set
of real numbers between, but not including, a and b. That is,
.
The points a and b are endpoints of the interval. The parentheses indicate
that the endpoints are not included in the interval.
Some intervals extend without bound in one or both directions. The
interval 
, for example, begins at a and extends to the right without
bound. That is,
.
The bracket indicates that a is included in the interval.

Absolute Value
The number line can be used to provide a geometric interpretation of
absolute value. The absolute value of a number a, denoted 
, is its dis-
tance from 0 on the number line. For example,
, because the 
distance of 5 from 0 is 5. Similarly,
, because the distance of
from 0 is .
Absolute Value
For any real number a,
When a is nonnegative, the absolute value of a is a. When a is negative,
the absolute value of a is the opposite, or additive inverse, of a. Thus,
is never negative; that is, for any real number a,
.
Absolute value can be used to find the distance between two points on
the number line.
Distance Between Two Points on the Number Line
For any real numbers a and b, the distance between a and b is
, or equivalently,
.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the distance between 2 and 3.
Solution
The distance is
,
or equivalently,
.
We can also use the absolute-value operation on a graphing calculator to
find the distance between two points. On many graphing calculators, ab-
solute value is denoted “abs” and is found in the MATH NUM menu and also
in the CATALOG.

Scientific Notation
We can use scientific notation to name very large and very small positive
numbers and to perform computations.
Scientific Notation
Scientific notation for a number is an expression of the type
,
where 
, N is in decimal notation, and m is an integer.
Keep in mind that in scientific notation positive exponents are used for
numbers greater than or equal to 10 and negative exponents for numbers
between 0 and 1.
EXAMPLE 5
Undergraduate Enrollment.
In a recent year, there were
16,539,000 undergraduate students enrolled in post-secondary institutions
in the United States (Source: U.S. National Center for Education Statistics).
Convert this number to scientific notation.
Solution
We want the decimal point to be positioned between the 1 and
the 6, so we move it 7 places to the left. Since the number to be converted is
greater than 10, the exponent must be positive.

EXAMPLE 6
Mass of a Neutron.
The mass of a neutron is about
0.00000000000000000000000000167 kg. Convert this number to scien-
tific notation.
Solution
We want the decimal point to be positioned between the 1 and
the 6, so we move it 27 places to the right. Since the number to be converted
is between 0 and 1, the exponent must be negative.
EXAMPLE 7
Convert each of the following to decimal notation.
a)
b)
Solution
a) The exponent is negative, so the number is between 0 and 1. We move the
decimal point 4 places to the left.
b) The exponent is positive, so the number is greater than 10. We move the
decimal point 5 places to the right.
Most calculators make use of scientific notation. For example, the num-
ber 48,000,000,000,000 might be expressed in one of the ways shown below.

Integer Exponents, Scientific Notation, and Order of Operations

Order of Operations
Recall that to simplify the expression 
, first we multiply 4 and 5 to
get 20 and then add 3 to get 23. Mathematicians have agreed on the follow-
ing procedure, or rules for order of operations.
Rules for Order of Operations
1. Do all calculations within grouping symbols before operations
outside. When nested grouping symbols are present, work from
the inside out.
2. Evaluate all exponential expressions.
3. Do all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.
4. Do all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.
EXAMPLE 9
Calculate each of the following.
a)
b)
Solution
a)
Doing the calculation within 
parentheses
Evaluating the exponential expression
Multiplying
Subtracting
b)
Note that fraction bars act as grouping symbols. That is, the given ex-
pression is equivalent to 
.
We can also enter these computations on a graphing calculator as shown
below.
To confirm that it is essential to include parentheses around the numer-
ator and around the denominator when the computation in Example 9(b) is
entered in a calculator, enter the computation without using these parenthe-
ses. What is the result?

Polynomials
Polynomials are a type of algebraic expression that you will often encounter
in your study of algebra. Some examples of polynomials are
,
,
,
and
.
All but the first are polynomials in one variable.
Polynomials in One Variable
A polynomial in one variable is any expression of the type
,
where n is a nonnegative integer and 
are real numbers,
called coefficients. The parts of a polynomial separated by plus 
signs are called terms. The leading coefficient is 
, and the
constant term is 
. If
the degree of the polynomial is n.
The polynomial is said to be written in descending order, because
the exponents decrease from left to right.
EXAMPLE 1
Identify the terms of the polynomial
.
Solution
Writing plus signs between the terms, we have
,
so the terms are
,
,
x,
and
12.
A polynomial, like 23, consisting of only a nonzero constant term has
degree 0. It is agreed that the polynomial consisting only of 0 has no degree.

POLYNOMIAL
DEGREE
a)

Algebraic expressions like 
and 
are polynomials in several variables. The degree of a term is the sum of
the exponents of the variables in that term. The degree of a polynomial is
the degree of the term of highest degree.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the degree of the polynomial
.
Solution
The degrees of the terms of
are 4, 6, and 0,
respectively, so the degree of the polynomial is 6.
A polynomial with just one term, like 
, is a monomial. If a poly-
nomial has two terms, like 
, it is a binomial. A polynomial with three
terms, like 
, is a trinomial.
Expressions like
,
,
and
are not polynomials, because they cannot be written in the form 
, where the exponents are all nonnegative in-
tegers and the coefficients are all real numbers.
Addition and Subtraction
If two terms of an expression have the same variables raised to the same
powers, they are called like terms, or similar terms. We can combine, or
collect, like terms using the distributive property. For example,
and
are like terms and
.
We add or subtract polynomials by combining like terms.

Basic Concepts of Algebra
We can find the product of two binomials by multiplying the First
terms, then the Outer terms, then the Inner terms, then the Last terms. Then
we combine like terms, if possible. This procedure is sometimes called FOIL.

Factor polynomials by removing a common factor.
Factor polynomials by grouping.
Factor trinomials of the type

Factor trinomials of the type 
,
, using the FOIL
method and the grouping method.
Factor special products of polynomials.
To factor a polynomial, we do the reverse of multiplying; that is, we find an
equivalent expression that is written as a product.
Terms with Common Factors
When a polynomial is to be factored, we should always look first to factor
out a factor that is common to all the terms using the distributive property.
We usually look for the constant common factor with the largest absolute
value and for variables with the largest exponent common to all the terms.
In this sense, we factor out the “largest” common factor.
EXAMPLE 1
Factor each of the following.
a)
b)
Solution
a)
We can always check a factorization by multiplying:
.
b) There are several factors common to the terms of
, but
is the “largest” of these.
Factoring by Grouping
In some polynomials, pairs of terms have a common binomial factor that
can be removed in a process called factoring by grouping.

Factoring

Trinomials of the Type 
Some trinomials can be factored into the product of two binomials. To
factor a trinomial of the form 
, we look for binomial factors
of the form
,
where 
and 
. That is, we look for two numbers p and q
whose sum is the coefficient of the middle term of the polynomial, b, and
whose product is the constant term, c.
When we factor any polynomial, we should always check first to deter-
mine whether there is a factor common to all the terms. If there is, we factor
it out first.
EXAMPLE 3
Factor:
.
Solution
First, we look for a common factor. There is none. Next, we look
for two numbers whose product is 6 and whose sum is 5. Since the constant
term, 6, and the coefficient of the middle term, 5, are both positive, we look
for a factorization of 6 in which both factors are positive.
The factorization is 
. We have
.
We can check this by multiplying:
.
EXAMPLE 4
Factor:
.
Solution
First, we look for a common factor. Each term has a factor of 2,
so we factor it out first:
.
Now we consider the trinomial 
. We look for two numbers
whose product is 12 and whose sum is 7. Since the constant term, 12, is
positive and the coefficient of the middle term, 7, is negative, we look for
a factorization of 12 in which both factors are negative.

The factorization of

the common factor that we factored out earlier. Thus we have
.
EXAMPLE 5
Factor:
.
Solution
First, we look for a common factor. Each term has a factor of
, so we factor it out first:
.
Now we consider the trinomial 
. We look for two numbers
whose product is 8 and whose sum is 2. Since the constant term, 8, is
negative, one factor will be positive and the other will be negative.
We might have observed at the outset that since the sum of the factors is 2,
a negative number, we need consider only pairs of factors for which the
negative factor has the greater absolute value. Thus only the pairs 1, 8
and 2, 4 need have been considered.
Using the pair of factors 2 and 4, we see that the factorization of
is 
. Including the common factor, we have

To factor

two binomials whose product is this trinomial. The product of the First
terms must be

the Inside terms must be 23x. The product of the Last terms must be 10. We
know from the preceding discussion that the answer is

Solution
1. There is no common factor (other than 1 or 1).
2. Factor the first term,
. The only possibility (with positive coeffi-
cients) is 
. The factorization, if it exists, must be of the form 
.
3. Next, factor the constant term, 8. The possibilities are 
,
,
, and 
. The factors can be written in the opposite order as well:
,
,
, and 
.
4. Find a pair of factors for which the sum of the outside and the inside
products is the middle term, 10x. Each possibility should be checked 
by multiplying. Some trials show that the desired factorization is
.
The Grouping Method
The second method for factoring trinomials of the type 
,
, is known as the grouping method, or the ac-method.

Basic Concepts of Algebra
We can use the following rules to factor a sum or a difference of cubes:
;
.
These rules can be verified by multiplying.
EXAMPLE 10
Factor each of the following.
a)
b)
Solution
a)
b)
Not all polynomials can be factored into polynomials with integer coef-
ficients. An example is 
. There are no real factors of 7 whose sum
is 1. In such a case we say that the polynomial is “not factorable,” or prime.

A STRATEGY FOR FACTORING
A. Always factor out the largest common factor first.
B. Look at the number of terms.
Two terms: Try factoring as a difference of squares first. Next, try
factoring as a sum or a difference of cubes. Do not try to factor a
sum of squares.
Three terms: Try factoring as the square of a binomial. Next, try
using the FOIL method or the grouping method for factoring a 
trinomial.
Four or more terms: Try factoring by grouping and factoring out a
common binomial factor.
C. Always factor completely. If a factor with more than one term can itself
be factored further, do so.

The Domain of a Rational Expression
The domain of an algebraic expression is the set of all real numbers for
which the expression is defined. Since division by zero is not defined,
any number that makes the denominator zero is not in the domain of a
rational expression.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the domain of each of the following.
a)
b)
Solution
a) Since 
is 0 when 
, the domain of
is the set of all 
real numbers except 3.
b) To determine the domain of
, we first factor 
the denominator:
.
The factor 
is 0 when 
, and the factor 
is 0 when
. Since 
when 
or 
, the domain is
the set of all real numbers except 1 and 5.
We can describe the domains found in Example 1 using set-builder
notation. For example, we write “The set of all real numbers x such that x
is not equal to 3” as
.
Similarly, we write “The set of all real numbers x such that x is not equal to
1 and x is not equal to 5” as
.

To multiply rational expressions, we multiply numerators and multi-
ply denominators and, if possible, simplify the result. To divide rational
expressions, we multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor and,
if possible, simplify the result—that is,

Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions
When rational expressions have the same denominator, we can add or sub-
tract by adding or subtracting the numerators and retaining the common
denominator. If the denominators differ, we must find equivalent rational
expressions that have a common denominator. In general, it is most efficient
to find the least common denominator (LCD) of the expressions.

To find the least common denominator of rational expressions, factor
each denominator and form the product that uses each factor the
greatest number of times it occurs in any factorization.

Complex Rational Expressions
A complex rational expression has rational expressions in its numerator or
its denominator or both.
To simplify a complex rational expression:
Method 1. Find the LCD of all the denominators within the
complex rational expression. Then multiply by 1 using the LCD
as the numerator and the denominator of the expression for 1.
Method 2. First add or subtract, if necessary, to get a single
rational expression in the numerator and in the denominator.
Then divide by multiplying by the reciprocal of the denominator.
EXAMPLE 6
Simplify:
.
Solution
Method 1. The LCD of the four rational expressions in the numerator
and the denominator is 
.

nth Root
A number c is said to be an nth root of a if
.
The symbol 
denotes the nonnegative square root of a, and the sym-
bol 
denotes the real-number cube root of a. The symbol 
denotes
the nth root of a, that is, a number whose nth power is a. The symbol 
is
called a radical, and the expression under the radical is called the radicand.
The number n (which is omitted when it is 2) is called the index. Examples
of roots for 
, 4, and 2, respectively, are
,
,
and
.
Any real number has only one real-number odd root. Any positive
number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. Similarly, for
any even index, a positive number has two real-number roots. The posi-
tive root is called the principal root. When an expression such as 
or
is used, it is understood to represent the principal (nonnegative)
root. To denote a negative root, we use 
,
, and so on.

We can generalize Example 1(e) and say that when a is negative and n
is even,
is not a real number. For example,
and 
are not
real numbers.
We can find 
and 
in Example 1 using the square-root 
feature on the keypad of a graphing calculator, and we can use the cube-root
feature to find 
. We can use the xth-root feature to find higher roots.

h)
Using Property 4
Using Property 1
In many situations, radicands are never formed by raising negative
quantities to even powers. In such cases, absolute-value notation is not re-
quired. For this reason, we will henceforth assume that no radicands are
formed by raising negative quantities to even powers. For example, we 
will write 
and 
.
Radical expressions with the same index and the same radicand can 
be combined (added or subtracted) in much the same way that we combine
like terms.

An Application
The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
The side opposite the triangle’s right angle is called the hypotenuse. The
other sides are the legs.
The Pythagorean Theorem
The sum of the squares of the lengths 
of the legs of a right triangle is equal 
to the square of the length of the 
hypotenuse:
.
EXAMPLE 4
Surveying.
A surveyor places poles at points A, B, and C in
order to measure the distance across a pond. The distances AC and BC are
measured as shown. Find the distance AB across the pond.
Solution
We see that the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are given.
Thus we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:
Solving for c
.
The distance across the pond is about 53.2 yd.
Rationalizing Denominators or Numerators
There are times when we need to remove the radicals in a denominator or a
numerator. This is called rationalizing the denominator or rationalizing
the numerator. It is done by multiplying by 1 in such a way as to obtain a
perfect nth power.

Solution
Rational Exponents
We are motivated to define rational exponents so that the properties for inte-
ger exponents hold for them as well. For example, we must have
.
Thus we are led to define

The Basics of
Equation Solving
•
Solve linear equations.
•
Solve quadratic equations.
An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. To solve an equa-
tion in one variable is to find all the values of the variable that make the
equation true. Each of these numbers is a solution of the equation. The set
of all solutions of an equation is its solution set. Equations that have the
same solution set are called equivalent equations.
Linear and Quadratic Equations
A linear equation in one variable is an equation that is equivalent
to one of the form 
where a and b are real numbers and
A quadratic equation is an equation that is equivalent to one of
the form 
where a, b, and c are real numbers and
The following principles allow us to solve many linear and quadratic
equations.
Equation-Solving Principles
For any real numbers a, b, and c,
The Addition Principle:
If
is true, then

First we consider a linear equation. We will use the addition and multi-
plication principles to solve it.

Many real-world situations can be modeled, or described mathemati-
cally, using equations in which two variables appear. We use a plane to
graph a pair of numbers. To locate points on a plane, we use two perpen-
dicular number lines, called axes, which intersect at 
. We call this
point the origin. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis, and the vertical
axis is called the y-axis. (Other variables, such as a and b, can also be used.)
The axes divide the plane into four regions, called quadrants, denoted by
Roman numerals and numbered counterclockwise from the upper right.
Arrows show the positive direction of each axis.
Each point 
in the plane is described by an ordered pair. The first
number, x, indicates the point’s horizontal location with respect to the 
y-axis, and the second number, y, indicates the point’s vertical location with

respect to the x-axis. We call x the first coordinate, x-coordinate, or ab-
scissa. We call y the second coordinate, y-coordinate, or ordinate. Such a
representation is called the Cartesian coordinate system in honor of the
French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650).
In the first quadrant, both coordinates of a point are positive. In the
second quadrant, the first coordinate is negative and the second is positive.
In the third quadrant, both coordinates are negative, and in the fourth
quadrant, the first coordinate is positive and the second is negative.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph and label the points 
,
,
,
,
,
,
, and 
.
Solution
To graph or plot
, we note that the x-coordinate, 3,
tells us to move from the origin 3 units to the left of the y-axis. Then we
move 5 units up from the x-axis.* To graph the other points, we proceed
in a similar manner. (See the graph at left.) Note that the point 
is 
different from the point 
.
Solutions of Equations
Equations in two variables, like 
, have solutions 
that are
ordered pairs such that when the first coordinate is substituted for x and the
second coordinate is substituted for y, the result is a true equation. The first
coordinate in an ordered pair generally represents the variable that occurs
first alphabetically.
EXAMPLE 2
Determine whether each ordered pair is a solution of
.
a)
b)
Solution
We substitute the ordered pair into the equation and determine
whether the resulting equation is true.
a)
We substitute 5 for x and 
7 for y (alphabetical order).
FALSE
The equation 
is false, so 
is not a solution.
b)
We substitute 3 for x
and 4 for y.
TRUE
The equation 
is true, so 
is a solution.

We can also perform these substitutions on a graphing calculator. When
we substitute 
for x and 7 for y, we get 11. Since 
is not a
solution of the equation. When we substitute 3 for x and 4 for y, we get 18,
so 
is a solution.
Graphs of Equations
The equation considered in Example 2 actually has an infinite number of
solutions. Since we cannot list all the solutions, we will make a drawing,
called a graph, that represents them. Shown at left are some suggestions
for drawing graphs.
To Graph an Equation
To graph an equation is to make a drawing that represents the
solutions of that equation.
Graphs of equations of the type 
are straight lines.
Many such equations can be graphed conveniently using intercepts. The 
x-intercept of the graph of an equation is the point at which the graph
crosses the x-axis. The y-intercept is the point at which the graph crosses
the y-axis. We know from geometry that only one line can be drawn
through two given points. Thus, if we know the intercepts, we can graph
the line. To ensure that a computational error has not been made, it is a
good idea to calculate and plot a third point as a check.
x- and y-Intercepts
An x-intercept is a point 
. To find a, let 
and solve for x.
A y-intercept is a point 
. To find b, let 
and solve for y.
EXAMPLE 3
Graph:
.
Solution
The graph is a line. To find ordered pairs that are solutions of this
equation, we can replace either x or y with any number and then solve for
the other variable. In this case, it is convenient to find the intercepts of the
graph. For instance, if x is replaced with 0, then
.

Thus,

with 0, then
.
Dividing by 2
Thus,
is a solution. It is the x-intercept of the graph. We find a third so-
lution as a check. If x is replaced with 5, then
Subtracting 10
.
Dividing by 3
Thus,
is a solution.
We list the solutions in a table and then plot the points. Note that the
points appear to lie on a straight line.
Were we to graph additional solutions of
, they would be
on the same straight line. Thus, to complete the graph, we use a straight-
edge to draw a line, as shown in the figure. This line represents all solutions
of the equation. Every point on the line represents a solution; every solution
is represented by a point on the line.
When graphing some equations, it is easier to first solve for y and then
find ordered pairs. We can use the addition and multiplication principles to
solve for y.

We first solve for y:

Suggestions for
Drawing Graphs
1. Calculate solutions and
list the ordered pairs in 
a table.
2. Use graph paper.
3. Draw axes and label them
with the variables.
4. Use arrows on the axes 
to indicate positive
directions.
5. Scale the axes; that is, label
the tick marks on the axes.
Consider the ordered pairs

By choosing multiples of 5 for x, we can avoid fraction values when calcu-
lating y. For example, if we choose 5 for x, we get
.
The following table lists a few more points. We plot the points and draw 
the graph.
In the equation 
, the value of y depends on the value 
chosen for x, so x is said to be the independent variable and y the 
dependent variable.
We can graph an equation on a graphing calculator. Many calculators
require an equation to be entered in the form “
.” In such a case, if
the equation is not initially given in this form, it must be solved for y
before it is entered. For the equation 
in Example 4, we 
enter 
on the equation-editor, or “
”, screen in the form
, as shown in the window at left.
Next, we determine the portion of the xy-plane that will appear on the
calculator’s screen. That portion of the plane is called the viewing window.
The notation used in this text to denote a window setting consists of four
numbers 
, which represent the Left and Right endpoints 
of the x-axis and the Bottom and Top endpoints of the y-axis, respectively.
The window with the settings 
is the standard viewing
window. On some graphing calculators, the standard window can be se-
lected quickly using the ZSTANDARD feature from the ZOOM menu.
Xmin and Xmax are used to set the left and right endpoints of the x-axis,
respectively; Ymin and Ymax are used to set the bottom and top endpoints
of the y-axis. The settings Xscl and Yscl give the scales for the axes. For ex-
ample,
and 
means that there is 1 unit between tick marks
on each of the axes.

After entering the equation 
and choosing a viewing
window, we can then draw the graph shown at left.
EXAMPLE 5
Graph:
.
Solution
Note that this is not of the form 
thus it is not
linear. We make a table of values, plot enough points to obtain an idea 
of the shape of the curve, and connect them with a smooth curve. It is 
important to scale the axes to include most of the ordered pairs listed in
the table. Here it is appropriate to use a larger scale on the y-axis than on
the x-axis.
A graphing calculator can be used to create a table of ordered pairs 
that are solutions of an equation. For the equation in Example 5,
, we first enter the equation on the equation-editor screen
(see Fig. 1). Then we set up a table in AUTO mode by designating a value 
for TBLSTART and a value for TBL. The calculator will produce a table 
starting with the value of TBLSTART and continuing by adding TBL to 
supply succeeding x-values. For the equation 
, we let 
TBLSTART
and TBL
(see Fig. 2).
We can scroll up and down in the table to find values other than those
shown in Fig. 3. We can also graph this equation on the graphing calculator,
as shown in Fig. 4.

The Distance Formula
Suppose that a conservationist needs to determine the distance across an
irregularly shaped pond. One way in which he or she might proceed is to
measure two legs of a right triangle that is situated as shown below. The
Pythagorean theorem,
, can then be used to find the length of
the hypotenuse, which is the distance across the pond.
A similar strategy is used to find the distance between two points in a
plane. For two points 
and 
, we can draw a right triangle in
which the legs have lengths 
and 
.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have
.
Because we are squaring, parentheses can replace the absolute-value 
symbols:
.
Taking the principal square root, we obtain the distance formula.

The Distance Formula
The distance d between any two points 
and 
is 
given by
.
The subtraction of the x-coordinates can be done in any order, as can
the subtraction of the y-coordinates. Although we derived the distance for-
mula by considering two points not on a horizontal or a vertical line, the dis-
tance formula holds for any two points.

Find the distance between the pair of points.

EXAMPLE 7
The point 
is on a circle that has 
as its center.
Find the length of the radius of the circle.
Solution
Since the length of the radius is the distance from the center to a
point on the circle, we substitute into the distance formula:
Either point can serve as 
.
Rounded to the nearest tenth
The radius of the circle is approximately 7.8.
Midpoints of Segments
The distance formula can be used to develop a way of determining the
midpoint of a segment when the endpoints are known. We state the for-
mula and leave its proof to the exercise set.

The Midpoint Formula
If the endpoints of a segment are 
and 
, then the
coordinates of the midpoint are
.
Note that we obtain the coordinates of the midpoint by averaging the
coordinates of the endpoints. This is a good way to remember the mid-
point formula.
EXAMPLE 8
Find the midpoint of the segment whose endpoints are
and 
.
Solution
Using the midpoint formula, we obtain
.
EXAMPLE 9
The diameter of a circle connects two points 
and
on the circle. Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.
Solution
Since the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter, we
use the midpoint formula:
,
or
,
or
.
The coordinates of the center are 
.
Circles
A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are a fixed distance r from 
a center
. Thus if a point 
is to be r units from the center, we
must have
.
Using the distance formula
Squaring both sides gives an equation of a circle. The distance r is the length
of a radius of the circle.

The Equation of a Circle
The equation of a circle with center 
and radius r, in standard
form, is
.
EXAMPLE 10
Find an equation of the circle having radius 5 and center
.
Solution
Using the standard form, we have
Substituting
.
EXAMPLE 11
Graph the circle 
.
Solution
We write the equation in standard form to determine the center
and the radius:
.
The center is 
and the radius is 4. We locate the center and draw the
circle using a compass.
If we square 
and 
in the equation of the circle in Example 11,
we obtain another form for the equation:
Squaring
.
Simplifying
This form is the general form of the equation of the circle. With equations
in general form, we can complete the square to find the center and the 
radius of the circle.

First, we regroup the terms in order to complete the square
twice, once with 
and once with

Regrouping
Next, we complete the square inside each set of parentheses. We want to
add something to both

. Then we add 0, or

Circles can also be graphed using a graphing calculator. We show one
method of doing so here. Another method is discussed in Section 6.2.
When we graph a circle, we select a viewing window in which the dis-
tance between units is visually the same on both axes. This procedure is
called squaring the viewing window. We do this so that the graph will not
be distorted. A graph of the circle 
in a nonsquared window is
shown in Fig. 1.
Figure 1
Figure 2
On many graphing calculators, the ratio of the height to the width
of the viewing screen is . When we choose a window in which 
and the length of the y-axis is the length of the x-axis, the window will be
squared. The windows with dimensions 
,
, and
are examples of squared windows. A graph of the circle
in a squared window is shown in Fig. 2. Many graphing 
calculators have an option on the ZOOM menu that squares the window 
automatically.
EXAMPLE 13
Graph the circle 
Solution
The circle 
has center 
and
radius 4, so the viewing window 
is a good choice for the
graph.
To graph a circle, we select the CIRCLE feature from the DRAW menu and
enter the coordinates of the center and the length of the radius. The graph
of the circle 
is shown here.

Functions 
and Graphs
Determine whether a correspondence or a relation is a function.
Find function values, or outputs, using a formula.
Determine whether a graph is that of a function.
Find the domain and the range of a function.
Solve applied problems using functions.
We now focus our attention on a concept that is fundamental to many areas
of mathematics—the idea of a function.
Functions
We first consider an application.
Thunder Time Related to Lightning Distance.
During a thunderstorm, it is
possible to calculate how far away, y (in miles), lightning is when the
sound of thunder arrives x seconds after the lightning has been sighted. It
is known that the distance, in miles, is of the time, in seconds. If we hear
the sound of thunder 15 seconds after we’ve seen the lightning, we know
that the lightning is 
, or 3 miles away. Similarly, 5 sec corresponds to
1 mi, 2 sec to mi, and so on. We can express this relationship with a set
of ordered pairs, a graph, and an equation.

DOMAIN
RANGE
To each registered student
there corresponds
an I. D. number.
To each mountain bike sold
there corresponds
its price.
To each number between
3 and 3
there corresponds
the square of that number.
The ordered pairs express a relationship, or correspondence, between
the first and second coordinates. We can see this relationship in the graph as
well. The equation that describes the correspondence is
.
This is an example of a function. In this case, distance y is a function of
time x; that is, y is a function of x, where x is the independent variable
and y is the dependent variable.
Let’s consider some other correspondences before giving the definition
of a function.
In each correspondence, the first set is called the domain and the second set
is called the range. For each member, or element, in the domain, there is
exactly one member in the range to which it corresponds. Thus each regis-
tered student has exactly one I. D. number, each mountain bike has exactly
one price, and each number between 3 and 3 has exactly one square. Each
correspondence is a function.
Function
A function is a correspondence between a first set, called the
domain, and a second set, called the range, such that each member
of the domain corresponds to exactly one member of the range.
It is important to note that not every correspondence between two sets
is a function.

Solution
a) This correspondence is a function because each member of the domain
corresponds to exactly one member of the range. Note that the definition
of a function allows more than one member of the domain to correspond
to the same member of the range.
b) This correspondence is not a function because there are members of the
domain (Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington) that are paired with more
than one member of the range (Roberts with The Pelican Brief and Pretty
Woman and Washington with The Pelican Brief and Remember the Titans).

Solution
a) This correspondence is a function because in each presidential election
exactly one president is elected.

c) This correspondence is not a function because each state can be paired
with two different senators.
d) This correspondence is a function because each senator represents only
one state.

Graphs, Functions, and Models
When a correspondence between two sets is not a function, it may still
be an example of a relation.
Relation
A relation is a correspondence between a first set, called the domain,
and a second set, called the range, such that each member of the
domain corresponds to at least one member of the range.
All the correspondences in Examples 1 and 2 are relations, but, as we
have seen, not all are functions. Relations are sometimes written as sets of
ordered pairs (as we saw earlier in the example on lightning) in which 
elements of the domain are the first coordinates of the ordered pairs and
elements of the range are the second coordinates. For example, instead of
writing 3
9, as we did in Example 1(a), we could write the ordered
pair 
.
EXAMPLE 3
Determine whether each of the following relations is a func-
tion. Identify the domain and the range.
a)
b)
c)
Solution
a) The relation is not a function because the ordered pairs 
and
have the same first coordinate and different second coordinates
(see Fig. 1).
The domain is the set of all first coordinates:
.
The range is the set of all second coordinates:
.
b) The relation is a function because no two ordered pairs have the same
first coordinate and different second coordinates (see Fig. 2).
The domain is the set of all first coordinates:
.
The range is the set of all second coordinates:
.
c) The relation is a function because no two ordered pairs have the same
first coordinate and different second coordinates (see Fig. 3).
The domain is 
.
The range is 
.
Notation for Functions
Functions used in mathematics are often given by equations. They gener-
ally require that certain calculations be performed in order to determine
which member of the range is paired with each member of the domain.

For example, in Section 1.1 we graphed the function 
by doing calculations like the following:
for 
,
,
for 
,
,
and
for 
,
.
A more concise notation is often used. For 
, the in-
puts (members of the domain) are values of x substituted into the equation.
The outputs (members of the range) are the resulting values of y. If we call
the function f, we can use x to represent an arbitrary input and 
—read
“f of x,” or “f at x,” or “the value of f at x”—to represent the corresponding
output. In this notation, the function given by 
is written
as 
and the above calculations would be
,
,
.
Keep in mind that 
does not mean 
.
Thus, instead of writing “when 
, the value of y is 10,” we can 
simply write “
,” which can be read as “f of 2 is 10” or “for the
input 2, the output of f is 10.” The letters g and h are also often used to
name functions.
EXAMPLE 4
A function f is given by 
. Find each of
the following.
a)
b)
c)
d)
Solution
We can think of this formula as follows:
.
Then to find an output for a given input we think: “Whatever goes in the
blank on the left goes in the blank(s) on the right.” This gives us a “recipe”
for finding outputs.
a)
b)
c)
d)
We can find function values with a graphing calculator. Most calculators
do not use function notation “
” to enter a function formula. In-
stead, we must enter the function using “
.” At left, we illustrate find-

Functions and Graphs
81
To find a function value, like 
, from a graph, we locate the input 3
on the horizontal axis, move vertically to the graph of the function, and then
move horizontally to find the output on the vertical axis. For the function
, we see that 
.
We know that when one member of the domain is paired with two or
more different members of the range, the correspondence is not a function.
Thus, when a graph contains two or more different points with the same first
coordinate, the graph cannot represent a function. (See the graph at left; note
that 3 is paired with 1, 2, and 5.) Points sharing a common first coordinate
are vertically above or below each other. This leads us to the vertical-line test.
The Vertical-Line Test
If it is possible for a vertical line to cross a graph more than once,
then the graph is not the graph of a function.
To apply the vertical-line test, we try to find a vertical line that crosses
the graph more than once. If we succeed, then the graph is not that of a func-
tion. If we do not, then the graph is that of a function.
EXAMPLE 6
Which of graphs (a) through (f ) (in red) are graphs of
functions? In graph (f ), the solid dot shows that 
belongs to the
graph. The open circle shows that 
does not belong to the graph.

Solution
Graphs (a), (e), and (f ) are graphs of functions because we can-
not find a vertical line that crosses any of them more than once. In (b), the
vertical line crosses the graph at three points, so graph (b) is not that of a
function. Also, in (c) and (d), we can find a vertical line that crosses the
graph more than once, so these are not graphs of functions.
Finding Domains of Functions
When a function f, whose inputs and outputs are real numbers, is given by a
formula, the domain is understood to be the set of all inputs for which the
expression is defined as a real number. When a substitution results in an ex-
pression that is not defined as a real number, we say that the function value
does not exist and that the number being substituted is not in the domain of
the function.

the given values are in the domain of the function.

Solution
a)
Since 
is defined, 1 is in the domain of f.
Since division by 0 is not defined, the number 3 is not in the domain
of f. In a table from a graphing calculator, this is indicated with an ERROR
message. Thus,
does not exist.
b)
Since 
is defined, 16 is in the domain of g.
Since 
is not defined as a real number, the number 7 is not in the
domain of g. Note the ERROR message in the table at left. Thus,
does not exist.

Inputs that make a denominator 0 or that yield a negative radicand in

symbol  for the union, or inclusion, of both sets:

b) We can substitute any number for which the radicand is nonnegative,
that is, for which

c) We can substitute any real number in the numerator, but we must avoid
inputs that make the denominator 0. To find those inputs, we solve
, or 
. Since

3 and 1, the domain consists of the set of all real numbers except 3
and 1, or 
, or 
.
d) We can substitute any real number for x. The domain is the set of all real 
numbers,
, or

Visualizing Domain and Range
Keep the following in mind regarding the graph of a function:
Domain
the set of a function’s inputs, found on the horizontal axis;
Range
the set of a function’s outputs, found on the vertical axis.
By carefully examining the graph of a function, we may be able to de-
termine the function’s domain as well as its range. Consider the graph of
, shown at left. We look for the inputs on the x-axis
that correspond to a point on the graph. We see that they extend from 1
to 3, inclusive. Thus the domain is 
, or 
.
To find the range, we look for the outputs on the y-axis. We see that
they extend from 0 to 2, inclusive. Thus the range of this function is
, or 
.

analysis. Think, “What can I substitute?” to find the domain. Think, “What
do I get out?” to find the range. Thus, in Examples 9(b) and 9(d), it might
not appear as though the domain is all real numbers because the graph rises
steeply, but by examining the equation we see that we can indeed substitute
any real number for x.

73. Territorial Area of an Animal.
The territorial area of
an animal is defined to be its defended, or exclusive,
region. For example, a lion has a certain region over
which it is considered ruler. It has been shown that
the territorial area T, in acres, of predatory animals
is a function of body weight w, in pounds, and is
given by the function
.
Find the territorial area of animals whose body
weights are 0.5 lb, 10 lb, 20 lb, 100 lb, and 200 lb.

Linear Functions, Slope, and Applications
91
Determine the slope of a line given two points on the line.
Solve applied problems involving slope and linear functions.
In real-life situations, we often need to make decisions on the basis of
limited information. When the given information is used to formulate 
an equation or inequality that at least approximates the situation mathe-
matically, we have created a model. One of the most frequently used mathe-
matical models is linear—the graph of a linear model is a straight line.
Linear Functions
Let’s begin to examine the connections among equations, functions, and
graphs that are straight lines. Compare the graphs of linear and nonlinear
functions shown here.

The Linear Function 
and Slope
To attach meaning to the constant m in the equation 
, we
first consider an application. Suppose FaxMax is an office machine business
that currently has stores in locations A and B in the same city. Their total
costs for the same time period are given by the two functions shown in the 
tables and graphs that follow. The variable x represents time, in months.
The variable y represents total costs, in thousands of dollars, over that
period of time. Look for a pattern.

We see in graph A that every change of 10 months results in a $50 thou-
sand change in total costs. But in graph B, changes of 10 months do not re-
sult in constant changes in total costs. This is a way to distinguish linear from
nonlinear functions. The rate at which a linear function changes, or the
steepness of its graph, is constant.
Mathematically, we define the steepness, or slope, of a line as the ratio
of its vertical change (rise) to the corresponding horizontal change (run).
That is, slope represents the rate of change of y with respect to x.

EXAMPLE 1
Graph the function 
and determine its
slope.
Solution
Since the equation for f is in the form 
, we know
it is a linear function. We can graph it by connecting two points on the graph
with a straight line. We calculate two ordered pairs, plot the points, graph
the function, and determine the slope:
;
;
Pairs:
,
;
.
The slope is the same for any two points on a line. Thus, to check our work,
note that 
. Using the points 
and 
, we have
.
We can also use the points in the opposite order when computing slope,
so long as we are consistent:
.
Note also that the slope of the line is the number m in the equation for
the function 
.
The slope of the line given by 
is m.

If a line slants up from left to right, the change in x and the change in y
have the same sign, so the line has a positive slope. The larger the slope, the
steeper the line, as shown in Fig. 1. If a line slants down from left to right,
the change in x and the change in y are of opposite signs, so the line has 
a negative slope. The larger the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the
line, as shown in Fig. 2. When

Horizontal and Vertical Lines
If a line is horizontal, the change in y for any two points is 0 and the
change in x is nonzero. Thus a horizontal line has slope 0 (see Fig. 4
on the next page).
If a line is vertical, the change in y for any two points is nonzero and
the change in x is 0. Thus the slope is not defined because we cannot
divide by 0 (see Fig. 5).

Note that zero slope and an undefined slope are two very different
concepts.

a)
b)
Solution
a) Since y is missing in 
, any value for y will do.
Choose any number for y; x must be 2.
The graph (see Fig. 6) is a vertical line 2 units to the left of the y-axis. The
slope is not defined. The graph is not the graph of a function.
b) Since x is missing in 
, any value for x will do.
Choose any number for x; y must be .
The graph (see Fig. 7) is a horizontal line , or 
, units above the x-axis.
The slope is 0. The graph is the graph of a constant function.
Applications of Slope
Slope has many real-world applications. Numbers like 2%, 4%, and 7% are
often used to represent the grade of a road. Such a number is meant to tell

how steep a road is on a hill or mountain. For example, a 4% grade means
that the road rises 4 ft for every horizontal distance of 100 ft.
The concept of grade is also used with a treadmill. During a treadmill
test, a cardiologist might change the slope, or grade, of the treadmill to
measure its effect on heart rate. Another example occurs in hydrology. The
strength or force of a river depends on how far the river falls vertically com-
pared to how far it flows horizontally.
EXAMPLE 3
Ramp for the Handicapped.
Construction laws regarding
access ramps for the handicapped state that every vertical rise of 1 ft requires
a horizontal run of 12 ft. What is the grade, or slope, of such a ramp?

a) Find the average rate of change in news consumption from newspapers
from 1996 to 2002.
b) Find the average rate of change in news consumption from online
sources from 1996 to 2002.
Solution
a) We determine the coordinates of two points on the graph. In this case,
we use 
and 
. Then we compute the slope, or
average rate of change, as follows:
.
This result tells us that, on average, each year from 1996 to 2002 news
consumption from newspapers decreased 
%. The average rate of
change over the 6-year period was a decrease of
% per year.
b) We determine the coordinates of two points on the graph. In this case, we

Applications of Linear Functions
We now consider an application of linear functions.
EXAMPLE 5
Height Estimates.
An anthropologist can use linear func-
tions to estimate the height of a male or a female, given the length of the
humerus, the bone from the elbow to the shoulder. The height, in centime-
ters, of an adult male with a humerus of length x, in centimeters, is given by
the function
.
The height, in centimeters, of an adult female with a humerus of length x is
given by the function
.
A 26-cm humerus was uncovered in a ruins. Assuming it was from a female,
how tall was she? What is the domain of this function?
Fx  2.75x  71.48
Mx  2.89x  70.64
Algebraic Solution
We substitute into the function:
Thus the female was 142.98 cm tall.
Graphical Solution
We graph 
and use the VALUE
feature to find 
The female was 142.98 cm tall.

Theoretically, the domain of the function is the set of all real numbers.
However, the context of the problem dictates a different domain. One could
not find a bone with a length of 0 or less. Thus the domain consists of posi-
tive real numbers, that is, the interval 
. A more realistic domain might
be 20 cm to 60 cm, the interval 
.

Any equation whose graph is a straight line is a linear equation. To find
the slope and the y-intercept of the graph of a linear equation, we can solve
for y, and then read the information from the equation.

Starting at the y-intercept and using the slope, we find another point by
moving 2 units down and 3 units to the right. We get a new point 
. In
a similar manner, we can move from 
to find another point 
.
We could also think of the slope 
as 
. Then we can start 
at 
and move 2 units up and 3 units to the left. We get to another point
on the graph,
. We now plot the points and draw the line. Note that
we need only the y-intercept and one other point in order to graph the line,
but it’s a good idea to find a third point as a check that the first two points 
are correct.
Point–Slope Equations of Lines
Another formula that can be used to determine an equation of a line is the
point–slope equation. Suppose that we have a nonvertical line and that the
coordinates of point 
on the line are 
. We can think of
as fixed
and imagine another point P on the line with coordinates 
. Thus the
slope is given by
.
Multiplying both sides by 
, we get the point–slope equation of the line:

line, we can find an equation of the line using either the point–slope
equation,
,
or the slope–intercept equation,
.

Using the Point–Slope Equation: We substitute 7 for m and either of the
points 
or

we use 
.

for b. Here we use

Graphs, Functions, and Models
If two different lines, such as 
and 
, are vertical,
then they are parallel. Thus two equations such as 
,
, where
, have graphs that are parallel lines. Two nonvertical lines, such 
as 
and 
, or, in general,
,
,
where the slopes are the same and 
, also have graphs that are 
parallel lines.
Parallel Lines
Vertical lines are parallel. Nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if
they have the same slope and different y-intercepts.
Perpendicular Lines
Can we examine a pair of equations to determine whether their graphs are
perpendicular without graphing the equations? Let’s observe the following
pairs of equations and their graphs.
Perpendicular Lines
Two lines with slopes 
and 
are perpendicular if and only if the
product of their slopes is 1:
.
Lines are also perpendicular if one is vertical 
and the other
is horizontal

If a line has slope 
, the slope 
of a line perpendicular to it is 
(The slope of one line is the opposite of the reciprocal of the other.)
EXAMPLE 7
Determine whether each of the following pairs of lines is
parallel, perpendicular, or neither.
a)
,
b)
,
c)
,
Solution
We use the slopes of the lines to determine whether the lines are
parallel or perpendicular.
a) We solve each equation for y:
,
.
The slopes are 5 and 
. Their product is 1, so the lines are perpendi-
cular (see Fig. 1). Note in the graphs at left that the graphing calculator
windows have been squared to avoid distortion. (Review squaring win-
dows in Section 1.1.)
b) Solving each equation for y, we get
,
.
We see that 
and 
. Since the slopes are the same and
the y-intercepts,
and 
, are different, the lines are parallel
(see Fig. 2).
c) Solving each equation for y, we get
,
.
Since 
and 
, we know that 
and that
. It follows that the lines are neither
parallel nor perpendicular (see Fig. 3).
EXAMPLE 8
Write equations of the lines (a) parallel and (b) perpendi-
cular to the graph of the line 
and containing the point 
.
Solution
We first solve 
for y to get 
. Thus the
slope of the given line is .
a) The line parallel to the given line will have slope . We use either the
slope–intercept equation or the point–slope equation for a line with
slope and containing the point 
. Here we use the point–slope
equation:

Mathematical Models
When a real-world problem can be described in mathematical language,
we have a mathematical model. For example, the natural numbers con-
stitute a mathematical model for situations in which counting is essential.
Situations in which algebra can be brought to bear often require the use
of functions as models.
Mathematical models are abstracted from real-world situations. The
mathematical model gives results that allow one to predict what will happen
in that real-world situation. If the predictions are inaccurate or the results 
of experimentation do not conform to the model, the model needs to be
changed or discarded.

Mathematical modeling can be an ongoing process. For example, find-
ing a mathematical model that will enable an accurate prediction of popula-
tion growth is not a simple problem. Any population model that one might
devise would need to be reshaped as further information is acquired.
Curve Fitting
We will develop and use many kinds of mathematical models in this text. In
this chapter, we have used linear functions as models. Other types of func-
tions, such as quadratic, cubic, and exponential functions, can also model
data. These functions are nonlinear. Modeling with quadratic and cubic
functions is discussed in Chapter 3. Modeling with exponential functions is
discussed in Chapter 4.
In general, we try to find a function that fits, as well as possible, obser-
vations (data), theoretical reasoning, and common sense. We call this curve
fitting; it is one aspect of mathematical modeling.
Let’s look at some data and related graphs or scatterplots and deter-
mine whether a linear function seems to fit the set of data.

Looking at the scatterplots, we see that the data on U.S. foreign travel-
ers seem to be rising in a manner to suggest that a linear function might fit,
although a “perfect” straight line cannot be drawn through the data points.
A linear function does not seem to fit the data on cellular phones.
EXAMPLE 9
Foreign Travel.
Model the data given in the table on
foreign travel on the preceding page with two different linear func-
tions. Then with each function, predict the number of U.S. travelers to
foreign countries in 2006. Of the two models, which appears to be the
better fit?
Solution
We can choose any two of the data points to determine an
equation. Let’s use 
and 
for our first model.
We first determine the slope of the line:
.
Then we substitute 0.1675 for m and either of the points 
or
for 
in the point–slope equation. In this case, we use
. We get
,
which simplifies to

where x is the number of years after 1994 and y is in millions.
For the second model, let’s use 
and 
. Again we first
determine the slope:
.
We can use the slope–intercept equation. The y-intercept,
, is one of
the data points. Substituting 0.2383 for m and 4.65 for b, we get
,
Model II
where x is the number of years after 1994 and y is in millions.
Now we can predict the number of U.S. foreign travelers in 2006 by sub-
stituting 12 for x
in each model:
Model I:
;
Model II:
.
Thus, using model I, we predict that there will be about 6.92 million U.S.
foreign travelers in 2006, and using model II, we predict about 7.51 million.
Since it appears from the graphs that model II fits the data more closely,
we would choose model II over model I.
Linear Regression
We now consider linear regression, a procedure that can be used to model
a set of data using a linear function. Although discussion leading to a com-
plete understanding of this method belongs in a statistics course, we present
the procedure here because we can carry it out easily using technology. The
graphing calculator gives us the powerful capability to find linear models
and to make predictions using them.
Consider the data presented on page 111 on the number of U.S. travel-
ers to foreign countries. We can fit a regression line of the form 
to the data using the LINEAR REGRESSION feature on a graphing calculator.
EXAMPLE 10
Foreign Travel.
Fit a regression line to the data given in
the table on foreign travel on page 111. Then use the function to predict the
number of U.S. travelers to foreign countries in 2006.
Solution
First, we enter the data in lists on the calculator. We enter the 
values of the independent variable x in list L1 and the corresponding values
of the dependent variable y in L2 (see Fig. 1 on the next page). The graphing
calculator can then create a scatterplot of the data, as shown in Fig. 2.

When we select the LINEAR REGRESSION feature from the STAT CALC
menu, we find the linear equation that best models the data. It is
Regression line
(see Figs. 3 and 4). We can then graph the regression line on the same graph
as the scatterplot, as shown in Fig. 5.
Figure 5
To predict the number of U.S. foreign travelers in 2006, we substitute 12
for x in the regression equation.
Using this model, we see that the number of U.S. travelers to foreign
countries in 2006 is predicted to be about 7.33 million. Note that 7.33 
is closer to the value found using model II than the one found using 
model I in Example 9.
The Correlation Coefficient
On some graphing calculators with the DIAGNOSTIC feature turned on, a
constant r between 1 and 1, called the coefficient of linear correlation,
appears with the equation of the regression line. Though we cannot develop
a formula for calculating r in this text, keep in mind that it is used to describe
the strength of the linear relationship between x and y. The closer 
is to 1,
the better the correlation. A positive value of r also indicates that the regres-
sion line has a positive slope, and a negative value of r indicates that the re-
gression line has a negative slope. For the foreign travel data just discussed,
,
which indicates a very good linear correlation.

95. Ted Williams and the War Years.
Ted Williams 
played for the Boston Red Sox from 1939–1960.
Many credit him with being the greatest hitter of all
time. Unfortunately, his career totals are somewhat
less impressive than others’ because his career was
interrupted from 1943–1945 by World War II and
from 1952–1953 by the Korean War. Some assert that
if he had been playing during the war years, he
would have broken Hank Aaron’s home run record
of 755 and runs batted in (RBI) record of 2297.

Graph functions, looking for intervals on which the function is
increasing, decreasing, or constant, and estimate relative maxima 
and minima.
Given an application, find a function that models the application; 
find the domain of the function and function values, and then graph 
the function.
Graph functions defined piecewise.
Because functions occur in so many real-world situations, it is important to
be able to analyze them carefully.
Increasing, Decreasing, and Constant Functions
On a given interval, if the graph of a function rises from left to right, it is said
to be increasing on that interval. If the graph drops from left to right, it is
said to be decreasing. If the function values stay the same from left to right,
the function is said to be constant.

We are led to the following definitions.
Increasing, Decreasing, and Constant Functions
A function f is said to be increasing on an open interval I, if for
all a and b in that interval,
implies 
. (See Fig. 1.)
A function f is said to be decreasing on an open interval I, if for all
a and b in that interval,
implies 
. (See Fig. 2.)
A function f is said to be constant on an open interval I, if for all a
and b in that interval,

EXAMPLE 1
Determine the intervals on which the function in the figure
at left is (a) increasing; (b) decreasing; (c) constant.
Solution
When expressing interval(s) on which a function is increas-
ing, decreasing, or constant, we consider only values in the domain of
the function.
a) For x-values (that is, values in the domain) from 
to 
, the 
y-values (that is, values in the range) increase from 2 to 2. Thus the
function is increasing on the interval 
.
b) For all x-values from negative infinity to 1, y-values decrease; y-values
also decrease for x-values from 5 to positive infinity. Thus the function is
decreasing on the intervals 
and 
.
c) For x-values from 1 to 3, y is 2. The function is constant on the
interval 
.
In calculus, the slope of a line tangent to the graph of a function at a
particular point is used to determine whether the function is increasing,
decreasing, or constant at that point. If the slope is positive, the function is
increasing; if the slope is negative, the function is decreasing. Since slope
cannot be both positive and negative at the same point, a function cannot
be both increasing and decreasing at a specific point. For this reason, in-
creasing, decreasing, and constant intervals are expressed in open interval
notation. In Example 1, if
had been used for the increasing interval
and 
for a decreasing interval, the function would be both increasing
and decreasing at 
. This is not possible.
Relative Maximum and Minimum Values
Consider the graph shown at the top of the next page. Note the “peaks”
and “valleys” at the x-values 
,
, and 
. The function value 
is
called a relative maximum (plural, maxima). Each of the function values
and 
is called a relative minimum (plural, minima).

Graphs, Functions, and Models
Relative Maxima and Minima
Suppose that f is a function for which 
exists for some c in the
domain of f. Then:
is a relative maximum if there exists an open interval I
containing c such that 
, for all x in I where 
; and
is a relative minimum if there exists an open interval I
containing c such that 
, for all x in I where 
.
Simply stated,
is a relative maximum if
is the highest point in
some open interval, and 
is a relative minimum if
is the lowest point
in some open interval.
If you take a calculus course, you will learn a method for determining
exact values of relative maxima and minima. In Section 2.4, we will find
exact maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions algebraically.
The MAXIMUM and MINIMUM features on a graphing calculator can be
used to approximate relative maxima and minima.
EXAMPLE 2
Use a graphing calculator to determine any relative 
maxima or minima of the function 
and
to determine intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.
Solution
We first graph the function, experimenting with the window 
as needed. The curvature is seen fairly well with window settings of
Using the MAXIMUM and MINIMUM features, we determine
the relative maximum value and the relative minimum value of the function.

Study Tip
Have reasonable expectations
about the time you need to study
for this course. Make an hour-by-
hour schedule of your typical
week. Include work, school, home,
sleep, study, and leisure times. Try
to schedule time for study when
you are most alert. Choose a
setting that will enable you to
maximize your powers of
concentration. Plan for success, and
it will happen.

We see that the relative maximum value of the function is about 2.004.
It occurs when 
We also approximate the relative minimum:
at 
We note that the graph rises, or increases, from the left and stops 
increasing at the relative maximum. From this point, the graph decreases to
the relative minimum and then begins to rise again. The function is increas-
ing on the intervals
and
and decreasing on the interval
.
Applications of Functions
Many real-world situations can be modeled by functions.
EXAMPLE 3
Car Distance.
Emma and Brandt drive away from a camp-
ground at right angles to each other. Emma’s speed is 65 mph and Brandt’s
is 55 mph.
a) Express the distance between the cars as a function of time.
b) Find the domain of the function.
c) Graph the function.
Solution
a) Suppose 1 hr goes by. At that time, Emma has traveled 65 mi and Brandt
has traveled 55 mi. We can use the Pythagorean theorem then to find 
the distance between them. This distance would be the length of the 
hypotenuse of a triangle with legs measuring 65 mi and 55 mi. After
2 hr, the triangle’s legs would measure 130 mi and 110 mi. Observing 
that the distances will always be changing, we make a drawing and let
the time in hours that Emma and Brandt have been driving since
leaving the campground.
After t hours, Emma has traveled 65t miles and Brandt 55t miles. We
can use the Pythagorean theorem:

Because distance must be nonnegative, we need consider only the posi-
tive square root when solving for 
:
Approximating the root to two decimal places
.
Since 
,
.
Thus,
,
.
b) Since the time traveled, t, must be nonnegative, the domain is the set of
nonnegative real numbers 
.
c) Because of the ease of using a graphing calculator, we can almost always
visualize a problem by making a graph. Here we observe that the func-
tion is increasing.
EXAMPLE 4
Storage Area.
The Sound Shop has 20 ft of dividers with
which to set off a rectangular area for the storage of overstock. If a corner of
the store is used for the storage area, the partition need only form two sides
of a rectangle.
a) Express the floor area of the storage space as a function of the length of
the partition.
b) Find the domain of the function.
c) Graph the function.
d) Find the dimensions that maximize the floor area.
Solution
a) Note that the dividers will form two sides of a rectangle. If, for
example, 14 ft of dividers are used for the length of the rec-
tangle, that would leave 
, or 6 ft of dividers for the
width. Thus if
the length, in feet, of the rectangle, then
the width. We represent this information in a
sketch, as shown at left.
The area,
, is given by
.
The function 
can be used to express the
rectangle’s area as a function of the length.
b) Because the rectangle’s length must be positive and only 20 ft of dividers
is available, we restrict the domain of A to 
, that is, the
interval 
.
c) The graph is shown at left.

Functions Defined Piecewise
Sometimes functions are defined piecewise using different output formulas
for different parts of the domain.
EXAMPLE 5
Graph the function defined as
Solution
We create the graph in three parts, as shown and described
below. We list some ordered pairs in tables shown at left.
a) We graph 
only for inputs x less than or equal to 0, that is, on the
interval 
. (See Table 1.)
b) We graph 
only for inputs x greater than 0 and less than or
equal to 2, that is, on the interval 
. (See Table 2.)
c) We graph 
only for inputs x greater than 2, that is, on the
interval 
. (See Table 3.)
To graph a function defined piecewise using a graphing calculator, con-
sult your user’s manual or the Graphing Calculator Manual that acompanies
this text. You might try the following way to enter the function formula for
Example 5. It incorporates parenthetic descriptions of the intervals. With
this method, you need to graph in DOT mode.

EXAMPLE 6
Graph the function defined as
Solution
When 
, the denominator of

nonzero, so we can simplify:
.
Thus
,
for 
.
The graph of this part of the function consists of a line with a “hole” at the
point 
, indicated by the open dot. The hole is necessary since the
function is not defined for 2. At 
, we have 
(by the defi-
nition of the function), so the point 
is plotted above the open dot.
The hand-drawn graph of
for 
in 
Example 6, can be checked using a graphing calculator. When 
is graphed, the hole may or may not be visible, depending
on the window dimensions chosen. First, graph using the dimensions of
your choosing. Then use the ZDECIMAL feature from the ZOOM menu. Note
the hole will appear, as shown in the graph at left. (See the Graphing Calcu-
lator Manual that accompanies this text for further details on selecting win-
dow dimensions.) If we use the TABLE feature set in ASK mode, as shown in
the table at left, the ERROR message indicates that 
is not in the domain of
the function g given by 
However,
is in the 
domain of the piecewise function f because 
is defined to be 3.
A piecewise function with importance in calculus and computer 
programming is the greatest integer function, f, denoted 
, or
.
Greatest Integer Function
the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
The greatest integer function pairs each input with the greatest integer
less than or equal to that input. Thus, x-values 1,
, and 1.8 are all paired
with the y-value 1. Other pairings are shown below.

If we used a graphing calculator set in CONNECTED mode for Example 7,
we would see the graph on the left below. CONNECTED mode connects
points (or rectangles called pixels on a graphing calculator) with line seg-
ments. We would see the graph on the right if we used DOT mode. The DOT
mode is preferable, though even it does not show the open dots at the end-
points of the segments.
Thus we must be careful when analyzing graphs of functions on 
graphing calculators. The use of technology must be combined with an 
understanding of the basic concepts of functions. This is why we balance
technology with a discussion of hand-drawn graphs.

Collaborative Discussion and Writing
75. Describe a real-world situation that could be
modeled by a function that is, in turn, increasing,
then constant, and finally decreasing.
76. Simply stated, a continuous function is a function
whose graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil
from the paper. Examine several functions in this
exercise set to see if they are continuous. Then
explore the continuous functions to estimate the
relative maxima and minima. For continuous
functions, how can you connect the ideas of
increasing and decreasing on an interval to relative
maxima and minima?

Difference Quotients
In Section 1.3, we learned that the slope of a line can be considered as an av-
erage rate of change. Here let’s consider a nonlinear function f and draw a line
through two points 
and 
as shown at left.
The slope of the line, called a secant line, is
,
which simplifies to
.
Difference quotient
This ratio is called the difference quotient, or the average rate of
change. In calculus, it is important to be able to find and simplify differ-
ence quotients.

The Composition of Functions
In real-world situations, it is not uncommon for the output of a function to
depend on some input that is itself an output of another function. For in-
stance, the amount a person pays as state income tax usually depends on the
amount of adjusted gross income on the person’s federal tax return, which,
in turn, depends on his or her annual earnings. Such functions are called
composite functions.
To illustrate how composite functions work, suppose a chemistry stu-
dent needs a formula to convert Fahrenheit temperatures to Kelvin units.
The formula
gives the Celsius temperature 
that corresponds to the Fahrenheit tem-
perature t. The formula
gives the Kelvin temperature 
that corresponds to the Celsius tempera-
ture c. Thus, 50
 Fahrenheit corresponds to
Celsius
and 10
 Celsius corresponds to
Kelvin.
We see that 50
 Fahrenheit is the same as 283
 Kelvin. This two-step proce-
dure can be used to convert any Fahrenheit temperature to Kelvin units.

In the table shown at left, we use a graphing calculator to con-
vert Fahrenheit temperatures, x, to Celsius temperatures,
using
We also convert Celsius temperatures to Kelvin units,
using 
A student making numerous conversions might look for a formula that
converts directly from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Such a formula can be found by
substitution:
Substituting
Simplifying
We can show on a graphing calculator that the same values that appear
in the table for 
will appear when 
is entered as
In the more commonly used function notation, we have
Substituting
Simplifying as above
Since the last equation expresses the Kelvin temperature as a new function,
K, of the Fahrenheit temperature, t, we can write
,
where 
is the Kelvin temperature corresponding to the Fahrenheit tem-
perature, t. Here we have 
. The new function K is called the
composition of k and c and can be denoted 
(read “k composed with c,”
“the composition of k and c,” or “k circle c”).
Composition of Functions
The composite function
, the composition of f and g, is 
defined as
,
where x is in the domain of g and 
is in the domain of f.

Solution
a)
b) The domain of f is

To find the domain of

. Next, we must consider that the outputs for g will serve as in-
puts for f. Since the inputs for f cannot be negative, we must have

Thus the domain of

, as the
graph in Fig. 1 confirms.
To find the domain of
, we first consider the domain of f,
. Next, we must consider that the outputs for f will serve as
inputs for g. Since g can accept any real number as an input, any out-
put from f is acceptable so the entire domain of f is the domain of
.
That is, the domain of

find the domain of

Decomposing a Function as a Composition
In calculus, one often needs to recognize how a function can be expressed 
as the composition of two functions. In this way, we are “decomposing”
the function.
EXAMPLE 7
If
, find 
and 
such that 
.
Solution
The function 
raises 
to the 5th power. Two func-
tions that can be used for the composition are
and
.
We can check by forming the composition:
.
This is the most “obvious” solution. There can be other less obvious solu-
tions. For example, if
and

Determine whether a graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the
y-axis, and the origin.
Determine whether a function is even, odd, or neither even nor odd.
Given the graph of a function, graph its transformation under
translations, reflections, stretchings, and shrinkings.
Symmetry
Symmetry occurs often in nature and in art. For example, when viewed from
the front, the bodies of most animals are at least approximately symmetric.
This means that each eye is the same distance from the center of the bridge
of the nose, each shoulder is the same distance from the center of the chest,
and so on. Architects have used symmetry for thousands of years to enhance
the beauty of buildings.
A knowledge of symmetry in mathematics helps us graph and analyze
equations and functions.

and 
that appear on the graph of

Study Tip
Try to keep one section ahead of
your syllabus. If you study ahead of
your lectures, you can concentrate
on what is being explained in
them, rather than trying to write
everything down. You can then
take notes only on special points or
of questions related to what is
happening in class.

y-values and are reflections of each other across the x-axis. If, for any
point 
on a graph, the point 
is also on the graph, then the
graph is said to be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. If we fold the
graph on the x-axis, the parts above and below the x-axis will coincide.
Consider the points 
and

site x-values and are reflections of each other across the y-axis. If, for any
point

graph is said to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. If we fold the
graph on the y-axis, the parts to the left and right of the y-axis will coincide.

nates of one pair, we get the other pair. If for any point 
on a graph the

with respect to the origin. Visually, if we rotate the graph 180
 about the
origin, the resulting figure coincides with the original.

Algebraic Tests of Symmetry
x-axis: If replacing y with y produces an equivalent equation,
then the graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.
y-axis: If replacing x with x produces an equivalent equation,
then the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
Origin: If replacing x with x and y with y produces an
equivalent equation, then the graph is symmetric with respect to the
origin.

Graphical Solution
We use a graphing calculator to graph the
equation.
Note that if the graph were folded on
the x-axis, the parts above and below the
x-axis would not coincide so the graph is
not symmetric with respect to the x-axis.
If it were folded on the y-axis, the parts to
the left and right of the y-axis would co-
incide so the graph is symmetric with re-
spect to the y-axis. If we rotated it 180
around the origin, the resulting graph
would not coincide with the original
graph so the graph is not symmetric with
respect to the origin.

cially with equations that we may not be able to graph easily. It is also often
more precise.

Even and Odd Functions
Now we relate symmetry to graphs of functions.
Even and Odd Functions
If the graph of a function f is symmetric with respect to the y-axis,
we say that it is an even function. That is, for each x in the domain
of f,
.
If the graph of a function f is symmetric with respect to the origin,
we say that it is an odd function. That is, for each x in the domain 
of f,
.
An algebraic procedure for determining even and odd functions is
shown at left. Here we include examples of both even and odd functions.
Many functions are neither even nor odd.

or vertically, stretching or shrinking them, and reflecting them across an
axis. We now consider these transformations.

For 
:
the graph of
is the graph of
shifted right
d units;
the graph of
is the graph of
shifted left 
d units.
EXAMPLE 4
Graph each of the following. Before doing so, describe how
each graph can be obtained from one of the basic graphs shown on the pre-
ceding pages.
a)
b)
c)
d)
Solution
a) To graph 
, think of the graph of
. Since
, the graph of
is the graph of
,
shifted, or translated, down 6 units (see Fig. 1).
Let’s compare some points on the graphs of f and g.
We observe that the y-coordinate of a point on the graph of g is 6 less
than the corresponding y-coordinate on the graph of f.
b) To graph 
, think of the graph of

Note to the student and the
instructor: We assume that
students come to a College
Algebra course with some
equation-solving skills from
Intermediate Algebra. Thus 
a portion of the material
presented in this section
might be considered by some
to be review in nature. In
fact, portions of it are
presented in Section R.7 of
this text. We present this
material here in order to use
linear functions, with which
students are familiar, to lay
the groundwork for zeros of
higher-order polynomial
functions and their
connection to solutions of
equations and x-intercepts 
of graphs.
Solve linear equations.
Solve applied problems using linear models.
Find zeros of linear functions.
Solve a formula for a given variable.
An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. To solve an equa-
tion in one variable is to find all the values of the variable that make the
equation true. Each of these numbers is a solution of the equation. The set
of all solutions of an equation is its solution set. Some examples of equa-
tions in one variable are
,
,
,
and
Linear Equations
The first two equations above are linear equations in one variable. We define
such equations as follows.
A linear equation in one variable is an equation that is equivalent
to one of the form 
, where m and b are real numbers 
and 
.
Equations that have the same solution set are equivalent equations. For
example,
and 
are equivalent equations because 1 is the
solution of each equation. On the other hand,
and
are not equivalent equations because 1 and 2 are both solutions of
but 2 is not a solution of
.
To solve an equation, we find an equivalent equation in which the vari-
able is isolated. The following principles allow us to solve linear equations.
Equation-Solving Principles
For any real numbers a, b, and c:
The Addition Principle:
If
is true, then 
is true.
The Multiplication Principle:
If
is true, then 
is true.

The following strategy is of great assistance in problem solving.
Five Steps for Problem Solving
1.
Familiarize yourself with the problem situation. If the problem
is presented in words, this means to read carefully. Some or all of
the following can also be helpful.
a) Make a drawing, if it makes sense to do so.
b) Make a written list of the known facts and a list of what you
wish to find out.
c) Assign variables to represent unknown quantities.
d) Organize the information in a chart or a table.
e) Find further information. Look up a formula, consult a reference
book or an expert in the field, or do research on the Internet.
f ) Guess or estimate the answer and check your guess or estimate.
2.
Translate the problem situation to mathematical language or
symbolism. For most of the problems you will encounter in 
algebra, this means to write one or more equations, but
sometimes an inequality or some other mathematical
symbolism may be appropriate.
3.
Carry out some type of mathematical manipulation. Use your
mathematical skills to find a possible solution. In algebra, this
usually means to solve an equation, an inequality, or a system of
equations or inequalities.
4.
Check to see whether your possible solution actually fits the
problem situation and is thus really a solution of the problem.
You might be able to solve an equation, but the solution(s) of the
equation might not be solution(s) of the original problem.
5.
State the answer clearly using a complete sentence.
EXAMPLE 3
Time Devoted to Media.
In 2003, each person in the
United States devoted an average of 3587 hr to TV, music, books, movies,
and the Internet. This was a 5% increase over the amount of time devoted to
these media in 1998. (Source: Veronis, Suhler & Associates) How much time
did each person devote to media, on average, in 1998?
Copyright © 2006 Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Addison-Wesley

182
Chapter 2
•
Functions, Equations, and Inequalities
Solution
1.
Familiarize. Let’s estimate that an average of 3400 hr was devoted to
media in 1998. Then the number of hours devoted to media in 2003
would be 
.
Since 3587 hr per person were actually devoted to media in 2003,
the estimate is close but a little low. Nevertheless, the calculations 
performed in checking the estimate indicate how we can translate 
this problem to an equation. We let 
the number of hours each
person devoted to media, on average, in 1998. Then 
, or
, or 1.05m, is the number of hours devoted to media
in 2003.
2.
Translate. We translate to an equation.
The time devoted to media
in 2003
was
3587 hr.
1.05m

3587
3.
Carry out. We solve the equation, as follows:
Dividing by 1.05 on both sides
.
4.
Check. We see that 5% of 3416 is about 171 and 
3587, so
the answer checks.
5.
State. On average, each person in the United States devoted about
3416 hr to media in 1998.
In some applications, we need to use a formula that describes the 
relationships among variables. When a situation involves distance, rate
(also called speed or velocity), and time, for example, we use the follow-
ing formula.
The Motion Formula
The distance d traveled by an object moving at rate r in time t is
given by

EXAMPLE 4
Airplane Speed.
America West Airlines’ fleet includes
Boeing 737-200’s, each with a cruising speed of 500 mph, and Bombardier
deHavilland Dash 8-200’s, each with a cruising speed of 302 mph (Source:
America West Airlines). Suppose that a Dash 8-200 takes off and travels 
at its cruising speed. One hour later, a 737-200 takes off and follows 
the same route, traveling at its cruising speed. How long will it take the
737-200 to overtake the Dash 8-200?
Solution
1.
Familiarize. We make a drawing showing both the known and the
unknown information. We let 
the time, in hours, that the 737-200
travels before it overtakes the Dash 8-200. Since the Dash 8-200 takes
off 1 hr before the 737, it will travel for 
hr before being over-
taken. The planes will have traveled the same distance, d, when one
overtakes the other.

in each row of the table, we get two
expressions for d:

Since the distances are the same, we have the following equation:

For some applications, we need to use a formula to find the amount of
interest earned by an investment or the amount of interest due on a loan.
The Simple-Interest Formula
The simple interest I on a principal of P dollars at interest rate r for 
t years is given by
.
EXAMPLE 5
Student Loans.
Jared’s two student loans total $12,000.
One loan is at 5% simple interest and the other is at 8% simple interest.
After 1 yr, Jared owes $750 in interest. What is the amount of each loan?
Solution
1.
Familiarize. We let 
the amount borrowed at 5% interest. Then the
remainder of the $12,000, or 
, is borrowed at 8%. We organ-
ize the information in a table, keeping in mind the formula 
.
2.
Translate. The total amount of interest on the two loans is $750. Thus
we write the following equation.

Cab Fare.
Metro Taxi charges a $1.25 pickup fee and $2
per mile traveled. Cecilia’s cab fare from the airport to her hotel is $31.25.
How many miles did she travel in the cab?
Solution
1.
Familiarize. Let’s guess that Cecilia traveled 12 mi in the cab. Then her
fare would be

allows us to become familiar with the concept of a zero, and it lays the
groundwork for working with zeros of other types of functions later in this
chapter and in succeeding chapters.
Zeros of Functions
An input c of a function f is called a zero of the function, if the
output for c is 0. That is, c is a zero of f if
.
Recall that a linear function is given by 
, where m and
b are constants. For the linear function 
, we have 
, so 2 is a zero of the function. In fact, 2 is the only zero of
this function. In general, a linear function
, with
,
has exactly one zero.
Consider the graph of
, shown at left. We see from the
graph that the zero, 2, is the first coordinate of the point at which the
graph crosses the x-axis. This point,
, is the x-intercept of the graph.
Thus when we find the zero of a linear function, we are also finding the
first coordinate of the x-intercept of the graph of the function.
For every linear function 
, there is an associated linear
equation 
. When we find the zero of a function 
,
we are also finding the solution of the equation 
.

55. NCAA Violations.
Colleges and universities are
responsible for self-reporting their secondary
violations to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association. (Most secondary violations are honest
mistakes for which there is rarely a penalty.) One
year, Division I and Division II schools together
reported 1989 secondary violations. Division I
schools reported about 6.5 times as many
secondary violations as Division II schools. (Source:
NCAA) How many secondary violations did each
division report?

review section R.6.
Perform computations involving complex numbers.
Some functions have zeros that are not real numbers. In order to find the
zeros of such functions, we must consider the complex-number system.
The Complex-Number System
We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real number.
For example,
is not a real number because there is no real number
x such that 
. This means that certain equations, like 
,
or 
, do not have real-number solutions and certain functions,
like 
, do not have real-number zeros. Consider the graph 
of
.
We see that the graph does not cross the x-axis and thus has no 
x-intercepts. This illustrates that the function 
has no 
real-number zeros. Thus there are no real-number solutions of the cor-
responding equation 
.
We can define a non-real number that is a solution of the equation
.

Study Tip
Don’t be hesitant to ask questions
in class at appropriate times. Most
instructors welcome questions and
encourage students to ask them.
Other students in your class
probably have the same questions
you do.
To express roots of negative numbers in terms of i, we can use the 
fact that
when p is a positive real number.

Complex Numbers
A complex number is a number of the form

a pure imaginary number. The relationships among various types of com-

Addition and Subtraction
The complex numbers obey the commutative, associative, and distributive
laws. Thus we can add and subtract them as we do binomials. We collect the
real parts and the imaginary parts of complex numbers just as we collect like
terms in binomials.
EXAMPLE 2
Add or subtract and simplify each of the following.
a)
b)
Solution
a)
Collecting the real parts and the imaginary parts
b)
Note that 6 and 3i are both being subtracted.
When set in 
mode, most graphing calculators can perform opera-
tions on complex numbers. The operations in Example 2 are shown in the

a)
Using 
b)
Conjugates are used when we divide complex numbers.
EXAMPLE 6
Divide 
by 
.
Solution
We write fraction notation and then multiply by 1, using the
conjugate of the denominator to form the symbol for 1.
.
With a graphing calculator set in 
mode, we can divide complex
numbers and express the real and imaginary parts in fraction form, just as
we did in Example 6.

Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation is an equation equivalent to
,
,
where a, b, and c are real numbers.
Quadratic Functions
A quadratic function f is a function that can be written in the form
,
,
where a, b, and c are real numbers.
A quadratic equation written in the form 
is said to be
in standard form.
The zeros of a quadratic function 
are the solu-
tions of the associated quadratic equation 
. (These so-
lutions are sometimes called roots of the equation.) Quadratic functions 
can have real-number or imaginary-number zeros and quadratic equa-
tions can have real-number or imaginary-number solutions. If the zeros
or solutions are real numbers, they are also the first coordinates of the 
x-intercepts of the graph of the quadratic function.
The following principles allow us to solve many quadratic equations.

CHECK:
We can check both solutions at once.
TRUE
The solutions are 
and 
, or 
.
We have seen that some quadratic equations can be solved by factoring
and using the principle of zero products. For example, consider the equation
:
Factoring
Using the principle of
zero products
.
The equation 
has two real-number solutions, 1 and 4.
These are the zeros of the associated quadratic function 
and the first coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of this function.
(See Fig. 1.)
Next, consider the equation 
. Again, we factor and use
the principle of zero products:
Factoring
Using the principle of
zero products
.
The equation 
has one real-number solution, 3. It is the
zero of the quadratic function 
and the first coordinate
of the x-intercept of the graph of this function. (See Fig. 2.)
The principle of square roots can be used to solve quadratic equations
like 
:
Using the principle of square roots
.
The equation has two imaginary-number solutions,
and 
.
These are the zeros of the associated quadratic function 
.
Since the zeros are not real numbers, the graph of the function has no 
x-intercepts. (See Fig. 3.)

Completing the Square
Neither the principle of zero products nor the principle of square roots would
yield the exact zeros of a function like 
or the exact
solutions of the associated equation 
. If we wish to find
exact zeros or solutions, we can use a procedure called completing the
square and then use the principle of square roots. (Recall that we com-
pleted the square in order to write the equation of a circle in standard
form in Section 1.1. Here we complete the square in order to solve quad-
ratic equations.)
EXAMPLE 3
Find the zeros of
by completing the
square.
Solution
We find the values of x for which 
. That is, we solve the
associated equation 
. Our goal is to find an equivalent
equation of the form 
in which 
is a perfect
square. Since
,
the number c is found by taking half the coefficient of the x-term and
squaring it. Thus for the equation 
, we have
Adding 10
Adding 9 to complete the square:
.
Because 
is a perfect square, we are able to write it as 
,
the square of a binomial. We can then use the principle of square roots to
finish the solution:
Factoring
Using the principle of square roots
.
Adding 3
Therefore, the solutions of the equation are 
and 
, or
simply 
. The zeros of
are also 
and 
, or 
.
Decimal approximations for 
can be found using a calculator:
and
.
The zeros are approximately 7.359 and 1.359.

To solve a quadratic equation by completing the square:
1. Isolate the terms with variables on one side of the equation and
arrange them in descending order.
2. Divide by the coefficient of the squared term if that coefficient is
not 1.
3. Complete the square by taking half the coefficient of the first-
degree term and adding its square on both sides of the equation.
4. Express one side of the equation as the square of a binomial.
5. Use the principle of square roots.
6. Solve for the variable.
Using the Quadratic Formula
Because completing the square works for any quadratic equation, it can 
be used to solve the general quadratic equation 
for x.
The result will be a formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equa-
tion quickly.
Consider any quadratic equation in standard form:
,
.
For now, we assume that 
and solve by completing the square. As the
steps are carried out, compare them with those of Example 4.

The Discriminant
From the quadratic formula, we know that the solutions 
and 
of a quad-
ratic equation are given by
and
.
The expression 
shows the nature of the solutions. This expression
is called the discriminant. If it is 0, then it makes no difference whether we 
choose the plus or the minus sign in the formula. That is,
,
so there is just one solution. In this case, we sometimes say that there is one
repeated real solution. If the discriminant is positive, there will be two real
solutions. If it is negative, we will be taking the square root of a negative
number; hence there will be two imaginary-number solutions, and they will
be complex conjugates.

In Example 5, the discriminant, 88, is positive, indicating that there are
two different real-number solutions. If the discriminant is negative, as it is
in Example 6, we know that there are two different imaginary-number 
solutions.
Equations Reducible to Quadratic
Some equations can be treated as quadratic, provided that we make a 
suitable substitution. For example, consider the following:
.
Substituting u for 
The equation 
can be solved for u by factoring or using
the quadratic formula. Then we can reverse the substitution, replacing u
with

reducible to quadratic, or quadratic in form.

As we saw in Section 1.7, the constant a serves to stretch or shrink the
graph vertically. As a parabola is stretched vertically, it becomes narrower,
and as it is shrunk vertically, it becomes wider. That is, as 
increases, the
graph becomes narrower, and as 
gets close to 0, the graph becomes wider.
If the equation is in the form 
, we can learn a
great deal about the graph without graphing.
Note that the vertex 
is used to find the maximum or the minimum
value of the function. The maximum or minimum value is the number k,
not the ordered pair 
.

EXAMPLE 1
Find the vertex, the axis of symmetry, and the maximum or
minimum value of
. Then graph the function.
Solution
To express 
in the form 
, we complete the square on the terms involving x. To 
do so, we take half the coefficient of x and square it, obtaining 
,
or 25. We now add and subtract that number on the right side:
.
Since 
, the new expression for the function is equivalent to the
original expression. Note that this process differs from the one we used to
complete the square in order to solve a quadratic equation, where we added
the same number on both sides of the equation to obtain an equivalent
equation. Instead, when we complete the square to write a function in the
form 
, we add and subtract the same number on the
right side. The entire process is shown below:
Note that 25 completes the 
square for 
.

Writing in the form 
Keeping in mind that this function will have a minimum value since 
(
), from this form of the function we know the following:
Vertex:
;
Axis of symmetry:
;
Minimum value of the function: 2.
To graph the function by hand, we first plot the vertex and find several
points on either side of it. Then we plot these points and connect them with
a smooth curve.
The graph of

above, is a shift of the graph of

Keep in mind that the axis of symmetry is not part of the graph; it is a
characteristic of the graph. If you fold the graph on its axis of symmetry, the
two halves of the graph will coincide.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the vertex, the axis of symmetry, and the maximum or
minimum value of
. Then graph the function.
Solution
We complete the square in order to write the function in the
form 
. First, we factor out of the first two terms. This
makes the coefficient of
within the parentheses 1:
.
Next, we complete the square inside the parentheses: Half of 8 is 4, and
. We add and subtract 16 inside the parentheses:

to remove

.
Factoring and simplifying
We know the following:
Vertex:
;
Axis of symmetry:
;
Minimum value of the function: 0.
Finally, we plot the vertex and several points on either side of it and draw the
graph of the function. The graph of g is a vertical shrinking of the graph of
along with a shift 4 units to the right.

This form of the function yields the following:
Vertex:
;
Axis of symmetry:
;
Maximum value of the function: 1.
The graph is found by shifting the graph of
to the right units, re-
flecting it across the x-axis, stretching it vertically, and shifting it up 1 unit.
In many situations, we want to find the coordinates of the vertex directly
from the equation 
using a formula. One way to de-
velop such a formula is to observe that the x-coordinate of the vertex is cen-
tered between the x-intercepts, or zeros, of the function. By averaging the
two solutions of
, we find a formula for the x-coordinate
of the vertex:
x-coordinate of vertex

We use this value of x to find the y-coordinate of the vertex,

Solution
There is no need to graph the function.
a) The x-coordinate of the vertex is
, or 7.
Since
,
the vertex is 
.
b) Since a is negative (
), the graph opens down so the second coor-
dinate of the vertex, 2, is the maximum value of the function.
c) The range is 
.
d) Since the graph opens down, function values increase as we approach
the vertex from the left and decrease as we move to the right from the
vertex. Thus the function is increasing on the interval 
and 
decreasing on 
.
We can use a graphing calculator to do Example 4. Once we have
graphed 
, we see that the graph opens down and thus
has a maximum value. We can use the MAXIMUM feature to find the coor-
dinates of the vertex. Using these coordinates, we can then find the maxi-
mum value and the range of the function along with the intervals on which
the function is increasing or decreasing.
Applications
Many real-world situations involve finding the maximum or minimum
value of a quadratic function.
EXAMPLE 5
Maximizing Area.
A stonemason has enough stones to en-
close a rectangular patio with 60 ft of stone wall. If the house forms one side
of the rectangle, what is the maximum area that the mason can enclose?
What should the dimensions of the patio be in order to yield this area?
Solution
We will use the five-step problem-solving strategy.
1.
Familiarize. We make a drawing of the situation, using w to repre-
sent the width of the patio, in feet. Then (
) feet of stone is
available for the length. Suppose the patio were 10 ft wide. It would
then be 
ft long. The area would be 
. If the patio were 12 ft wide, it would be

long. The area would be 
. If it were 16 ft wide,
it would be 
ft long and the area would be
. There are more combinations of length 
and width than we could possibly try. Instead we will find a function
that represents the area and then determine the maximum value 
of the function.
2.
Translate. Since the area of a rectangle is given by length times width,
we have
;
,
where 
is the area of the patio, in square feet, as a function of the
width, w.
3.
Carry out. To solve this problem, we need to determine the maxi-
mum value of
and find the dimensions for which that maxi-
mum occurs. Since A is a quadratic function and 
has a negative
coefficient, we know that the function has a maximum value that 
occurs at the vertex of the graph of the function. The first coordinate
of the vertex,
, is
.
Thus, if
ft, then the length 
ft; and the area
is 
, or 450 
.
4.
Check. As a partial check, we note that 450 
, which is the
largest area we found in a guess in the Familiarize step. As a more com-
plete check, assuming that the function 
is correct, we could exam-
ine a table of values for 
and/or examine its graph.
5.
State. The maximum possible area is 450 
when the patio is 15 ft wide
and 30 ft long.
EXAMPLE 6
Height of a Rocket.
A model rocket is launched with 
an initial velocity of 100 
from the top of a hill that is 20 ft high.
Its height t seconds after it has been launched is given by the func-
tion 
. Determine the time at which the rocket
reaches its maximum height and find the maximum height.

Solution
1., 2.
Familiarize and Translate. We are given the function in the state-
ment of the problem.
3.
Carry out. We need to find the maximum value of the function and the
value of t for which it occurs. Since 
is a quadratic function and 
has a negative coefficient, we know that the maximum value of the func-
tion occurs at the vertex of the graph of the function. The first coordi-
nate of the vertex gives the time t at which the rocket reaches its
maximum height. It is
.
The second coordinate of the vertex gives the maximum height of the
rocket. We substitute in the function to find it:
.
4.
Check. As a check, we can complete the square to write the function
in the form 
and determine the coordinates of
the vertex from this form of the function. We get
176.25.
This confirms that the vertex is 
, so the answer checks.
5.
State. The rocket reaches a maximum height of 176.25 ft 3.125 sec after
it has been launched.
EXAMPLE 7
Finding the Depth of a Well.
Two seconds after a chlorine
tablet has been dropped into a well, a splash is heard. The speed of sound is
1100 
. How far is the top of the well from the water?
Solution
1.
Familiarize. We first make a drawing and label it with known and un-
known information. We let 
the depth of the well, in feet,
the
time, in seconds, that it takes for the tablet to hit the water, and 
the
time, in seconds, that it takes for the sound to reach the top of the well.
This gives us the equation
.
(1)
2.
Translate. Can we find any relationship between the two times and the
distance s? Often in problem solving you may need to look up related
formulas in a physics book, another mathematics book, or on the Inter-
net. We find that the formula
gives the distance, in feet, that a dropped object falls in t seconds. The
time 
that it takes the tablet to hit the water can be found as follows:
,
or
, so

108. Employment Projections.
It is projected that the 
most rapid growth in employment in the U.S. in
the first decade of the 21st century will be in the
computer and data-processing services industry,
when employment will increase from 2,094,900 in
2000 to 3,900,000 in 2010 (Source: U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics). Find the percent of increase.

Solving
Solve rational and radical equations and equations with absolute value.
Rational Equations
Equations containing rational expressions are called rational equations.
Solving such equations involves multiplying both sides by the least common
denominator (LCD) to clear the equation of fractions.

Multiplying by the LCD on both
sides to clear fractions
Copyright © 2006 Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Addison-Wesley

CAUTION! Clearing fractions is a valid procedure when solving
rational equations but not when adding, subtracting, multiplying,
or dividing rational expressions. A rational expression may have
operation signs but no equals sign. A rational equation always has 
an equals sign. For example,
is a rational expression 
but 
is a rational equation. To simplify the 
rational expression
, we first find the LCD and write 
each fraction with that denominator. The final result is usually a 
rational expression. To solve the rational equation
,
we first multiply both sides by the LCD to clear fractions. The final
result is one or more numbers. As we will see in Example 2, these
numbers must be checked in the original equation.
When we use the multiplication principle to multiply (or divide) on
both sides of an equation by an expression with a variable, we might 
not obtain an equivalent equation. We must check the possible solutions 
obtained in this manner by substituting them in the original equation.
The next example illustrates this.
EXAMPLE 2
Solve:
.
Solution

.
Using the principle of square roots
The possible solutions are 3 and 3. We check.
CHECK:

The number 3 checks, so it is a solution. Since division by 0 is not
defined, 3 is not a solution.

A radical equation is an equation in which variables appear in one or more
radicands. For example,

Study Tip
Consider forming a study group
with some of your fellow students.
Exchange e-mail addresses,
telephone numbers, and schedules
so you can coordinate study time
for homework and tests.
When we raise both sides of an equation to an even power, the resulting
equation can have solutions that the original equation does not. This is 
because the converse of the principle of powers is not necessarily true. That
is, if
is true, we do not know that 
is true. For example,
, but 
. Thus, as we see in Example 3, it is necessary to
check the possible solutions in the original equation when the principle of
powers is used to raise both sides of an equation to an even power.
When a radical equation has two radical terms on one side, we isolate
one of them and then use the principle of powers. If, after doing so, a radi-
cal term remains, we repeat these steps.

Solve:
.

Solve compound inequalities.
Solve inequalities with absolute value.
Solve applied problems using inequalities.
An inequality is a sentence with 
,
,
, or 
as its verb. An example is
. To solve an inequality is to find all values of the variable
that make the inequality true. Each of these numbers is a solution of the in-
equality, and the set of all such solutions is its solution set. Inequalities that
have the same solution set are called equivalent inequalities.
Linear Inequalities
The principles for solving inequalities are similar to those for solv-
ing equations.
Principles for Solving Inequalities
For any real numbers a, b, and c:
The Addition Principle for Inequalities: If
is true, then
is true.
The Multiplication Principle for Inequalities: If
and 
are true, then 
is true. If
and 
are true, then
is true.
Similar statements hold for 
.
When both sides of an inequality are multiplied by a negative
number, we must reverse the inequality sign.

Compound Inequalities
When two inequalities are joined by the word and or the word or, a com-
pound inequality is formed. A compound inequality like
and
is called a conjunction, because it uses the word and. The sentence
is an abbreviation for the preceding conjunction.
Compound inequalities can be solved using the addition and multipli-
cation principles for inequalities.

Solution

Subtracting 5

Dividing by 2
The solution set is 
, or 
. The graph of the solution
set is shown below.
We can perform a partial check of the solution graphically using operations
from the TEST menu of a graphing calculator.We graph 
and
in DOT mode. The calculator graphs a segment 1 unit
above the x-axis for the values of x for which this expression for y is true.
Here the number 1 corresponds to “true.”
The segment extends from 4 to 1, confirming that all x-values from
4 to 1 are in the solution set. The algebraic solution indicates that the end-
point 1 is also in the solution set.
A compound inequality like 
is called a
disjunction, because it contains the word or. Unlike some conjunctions, it
cannot be abbreviated; that is, it cannot be written without the word or.

An Application
EXAMPLE 5
Income Plans.
For his house-painting job, Eric can be paid
in one of two ways:
Plan A: $250 plus $10 per hour;
Plan B: $20 per hour.
Suppose that a job takes n hours. For what values of n is plan B better 
for Eric?
Solution
1.
Familiarize. Suppose that a job takes 20 hr. Then 
, and under
plan A, Eric would earn 
, or 
, or $450. His
earnings under plan B would be 
, or $400. This shows that 
plan A is better for Eric if a job takes 20 hr. Similarly, if a job takes 30 hr,
then 
, and under plan A, Eric would earn 
, or
, or $550. Under plan B, he would earn 
, or $600,
so plan B is better in this case. To determine all values of n for which
plan B is better for Eric, we solve an inequality. Our work in this step
helps us write the inequality.
2.
Translate. We translate to an inequality.
Income from plan B
is greater than
income from plan A.
20n
3.
Carry out. We solve the inequality:
Subtracting 10n on both sides
.
Dividing by 10 on both sides
4.
Check. For 
, the income from plan A is 
, or
, or $500, and the income from plan B is 
, or $500.
This shows that for a job that takes 25 hr to complete, the income is the
same under either plan. In the Familiarize step, we saw that plan B pays
more for a 30-hr job. Since 
, this provides a partial check of the
result. We cannot check all values of n.
5.
State. For values of n greater than 25 hr, plan B is better for Eric.

dog’s life span is typically much shorter
than that of a human. We can use a graph-
ing calculator to fit a polynomial function
to data relating the age of a dog to a human’s age.
This function can then be used to estimate the 
equivalent human age for a dog of a given age.
This problem appears as Exercise 76 in Section 3.1.

Polynomial
Functions and
Modeling
Determine the behavior of the graph of a polynomial function using the
leading-term test.
Factor polynomial functions and find the zeros and their multiplicities.
Use a graphing calculator to graph a polynomial function and find its
real-number zeros, relative maximum and minimum values, and
domain and range.
Solve applied problems using polynomial models; fit linear, quadratic,
power, cubic, and quartic polynomial functions to data.
There are many kinds of functions. The constant, linear, and quadratic func-
tions that we studied in Chapters 1 and 2 are part of a larger group of func-
tions called polynomial functions.
Polynomial Function
A polynomial function P is given by
,
where the coefficients 
,
,
are real numbers and the
exponents are whole numbers.
The first nonzero coefficient,
, is called the leading coefficient. The
term 
is called the leading term. The degree of the polynomial function
is n. Some examples of polynomial functions are as follows.

The function 
can be described in many ways:
,
and so on. For this reason, we say that the constant function 
has
no degree.
From our study of functions in Chapters 1 and 2, we know how to
find or at least estimate many characteristics of a polynomial function.
Let’s consider two examples for review.

The Leading-Term Test
The behavior of the graph of a polynomial function as x becomes very
large 
or very small 
is referred to as the end behavior
of the graph. The leading term of a polynomial function determines its
end behavior.
Using the graphs shown below, let’s see if we can discover some general
patterns by comparing the end behavior of even- and odd-degree functions.
We also observe the effect of positive and negative leading coefficients.

The connection between the real-number zeros of a function and the
x-intercepts of the graph of the function is easily seen in the preceding 
examples. If c is a real zero of a function (that is,
), then 
is an
x-intercept of the graph of the function.
EXAMPLE 2
Consider 
. Determine whether
each of the numbers 2 and 5 is a zero of
.
Solution
We have
.
Substituting 2 into 
the polynomial
Since 
, we know that 2 is not a zero of the polynomial.
We also have
.
Substituting 5 into 
the polynomial
Since 
, we know that 5 is a zero of
.
Let’s take a closer look at the polynomial function
(see Connecting the Concepts on page 263). Is there a connection between
the factors of the polynomial and the zeros of the function? The factors of
are
,
,
and
,
and the zeros are
3,
1,
and
2.
We note that when the polynomial is expressed as a product of linear factors,
each factor determines a zero of the function. Thus if we know the linear fac-
tors of a polynomial function 
, we can easily find the zeros of
by
solving the equation 
using the principle of zero products.

Polynomial Functions and Modeling

Let’s consider the occurrences of the zeros in the functions in Ex-
amples 3 and 4 and their relationship to the graphs of those functions.
In Example 3, the factor 
occurs three times. In a case like this,
we say that the zero we obtain from this factor, 2, has a multiplicity of 3.
The factor 
occurs one time. The zero we obtain from this factor,
1, has a multiplicity of 1.
In Example 4, the factors 
and 
each occur two times. Thus
both zeros, 1 and 2, have a multiplicity of 2.
Note, in Example 3, that the zeros have odd multiplicities and the graph
crosses the x-axis at both 1 and 2. But in Example 4, the zeros have even
multiplicities and the graph is tangent to (touches but does not cross) the
x-axis at 2 and 1. This leads us to the following generalization.
Even and Odd Multiplicity
If
,
, is a factor of a polynomial function 
and
is not a factor and:
k is odd, then the graph crosses the x-axis at 
;
k is even, then the graph is tangent to the x-axis at 
.
Some polynomials can be factored by grouping. Then we can use the
principle of zero products to find their zeros.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the zeros of
.
Solution
We factor by grouping, as follows:
Grouping 
with 
and 
9x with 18 and factoring 
each group
Factoring out 
.
Factoring 
Then, by the principle of zero products, the solutions of the equation 
are 2, 3, and 3. These are the zeros of
.
Other factoring techniques can also be used.

We now solve the equation 
to determine the zeros. We use the
principle of zero products:
.
The solutions are 
and 	3i. These are the zeros of
.
Only the real-number zeros of a function correspond to the x-intercepts
of its graph. For instance, the real-number zeros of the function in Ex-
ample 6,
and 
, can be seen on the graph of the function at left,
but the nonreal zeros, 3i and 3i, cannot.
Every polynomial function of degree n, with 
, has at least one
zero and at most n zeros.
This is often stated as follows: “Every polynomial function of degree n,
with 
, has exactly n zeros.” This statement is compatible with the pre-
ceding statement, if one takes multiplicities into account.
Finding Real Zeros on a Calculator
Finding exact values of the real zeros of a function can be difficult. We can
find approximations using a graphing calculator.
EXAMPLE 7
Find the real zeros of the function f given by
Approximate the zeros to three decimal places.
Solution
We use a graphing calculator, trying to create a graph that clearly
shows the curvature. Then we look for points where the graph crosses the 
x-axis. It appears that there are three zeros, one near 
one near 2, and one
near 6. We use the ZERO feature to find them.
The zeros are approximately 
2.154, and 5.526.

Polynomial Models
Polynomial functions have many uses as models in science, engineering,
and business. The simplest use of polynomial functions in applied prob-
lems occurs when we merely evaluate a polynomial function. In such
cases, a model has already been developed.
EXAMPLE 8
Ibuprofen in the Bloodstream.
The polynomial function
can be used to estimate the number of milligrams of the pain relief medi-
cation ibuprofen in the bloodstream t hours after 400 mg of the medica-
tion has been taken.
a) Find the number of milligrams in the bloodstream at 
, 0.5, 1, 1.5,
and so on, up to 6 hr. Round the function values to the nearest tenth.
b) Find the domain, the relative maximum and where it occurs, and 
the range.
Solution
a) We can evaluate the function with the TABLE feature of a graphing calcu-
lator set in AUTO mode. We start at 0 and use a step-value of 0.5.
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
.
,
b) Recall that the domain of a polynomial function, unless restricted by
a statement of the function, is 
. The implications of the appli-
cation restrict the domain of the function. If we assume that a patient
had not taken any of the medication before, it seems reasonable that
; that is, at time 0, there is 0 mg of the medication in the
bloodstream. After the medication has been taken,
will be posi-
tive for a period of time and eventually decrease back to 0 when 
and not increase again (unless another dose is taken). Thus the re-
stricted domain is 
.
To determine the range, we find the relative maximum value of the
function using the MAXIMUM feature. The maximum is about 345.76 mg.
It occurs approximately 2.15 hr, or 2 hr 9 min, after the initial dose has 
been taken. The range is about 
.
In Chapter 1, we used regression to model data with linear functions. We
now expand that procedure to include quadratic, cubic, and quartic models.

EXAMPLE 9
Declining Number of Farms in the United States.
Today U.S.
farm acreage is about the same as it was in the early part of the twentieth
century, but the number of farms has decreased.
Looking at the graph above, we note that the data could be modeled
with a cubic or a quartic function.
a) Model the data with both cubic and quartic functions. Let the first coor-
dinate of each data point be the number of years after 1900. That is, enter
the data as 
,
,
, and so on. Then using 
,
the coefficient of determination, decide which function is the better fit.
The 
-value gives an indication of how well the function fits the data.
The closer 
is to 1, the better the fit.
b) Graph the function with the scatterplot of the data.
c) Use the answer to part (a) to estimate the number of farms in 1945, 1975,
2010, and 2020.
Solution
a) Using the REGRESSION feature with DIAGNOSTIC turned on, we get the
following.
Since the 
-value for the quartic function is closer to 1 than that for
the cubic function, the quartic function is the better fit. Note that a and

b are given in scientific notation on the graphing calculator, but we con-
vert to decimal notation when we write the function.
b) The scatterplot and graph are shown at left.
c) We evaluate the function found in part (a).
With this function, we can estimate that there were about 5.524 million
farms in 1945 and about 2.794 million in 1975. Looking at the bar graph
shown on the preceding page, we see that these estimates appear to be
fairly accurate.
If we use the function to estimate the number of farms in 2010 and
in 2020, we get about 3.219 million and 5.410 million, respectively. These
estimates are probably not realistic since it is not reasonable to expect the
number of forms to increase in the future. The quartic model has a high
value for 
approximately 0.992, over the domain of the data, but this
number does not reflect the degree of accuracy for extended values. It is
always important when using regression to evaluate predictions with
common sense and knowledge of current trends.

Graph polynomial functions.
Use the intermediate value theorem to determine whether a function has
a real zero between two given real numbers.
Graphing Polynomial Functions
In addition to using the leading-term test and finding the zeros of the
function, it is helpful to consider the following facts when graphing a
polynomial function.
If
is a polynomial function of degree n, the graph of the
function has:
at most n real zeros, and thus at most n x-intercepts;
at most 
turning points.
(Turning points on a graph, also called relative maxima and minima,
occur when the function changes from decreasing to increasing or
from increasing to decreasing.)
EXAMPLE 1
Graph the polynomial function 
.
Solution
1. First, we use the leading-term test to determine the end behavior of the
graph. The leading term is 
. The degree, 4, is even, and the coeffi-
cient, 2, is negative. Thus the end behavior of the graph as 
and
as 
can be sketched as follows.
2. The zeros of the function are the first coordinates of the x-intercepts of
the graph. To find the zeros, we solve 
by factoring and using the
principle of zero products.
Factoring

zero products
.
The zeros of the function are 0 and . Note that the multiplicity of 0 
is 3 and the multiplicity of
is 1. The x-intercepts are

3. The zeros divide the x-axis into three intervals:
,
,
and
.
The sign of
is the same for all values of x in each of the three inter-
vals. That is,
is positive for all x-values in an interval or 
is 
negative for all x-values in an interval. To determine which, we choose a
test value for x from each interval and find 
.
This test-point procedure also gives us three points to plot. In this case,
we have 
,
, and 
.
4. To determine the y-intercept, we find 
:
.
The y-intercept is 
.
5. A few additional points are helpful when completing the graph.

6. The degree of h is 4. The graph of h can have at most 4 x-intercepts and
at most 3 turning points. In fact, it has 2 x-intercepts and 1 turning
point. The zeros, 0 and , each have odd multiplicities, 3 for 0 and 1 
for . Since the multiplicities are odd, the graph crosses the x-axis 
at 0 and . The end behavior of the graph is what we described in 
step (1). As 
and 
,
. The graph appears to
be correct.
The following is a procedure for graphing polynomial functions.
To graph a polynomial function:
1. Use the leading-term test to determine the end behavior.
2. Find the zeros of the function by solving 
. Any real zeros
are the first coordinates of the x-intercepts.
3. Use the x-intercepts (zeros) to divide the x-axis into intervals and
choose a test point in each interval to determine the sign of all
function values in that interval.
4. Find 
. This gives the y-intercept of the function.
5. If necessary, find additional function values to determine the
general shape of the graph and then draw the graph.
6. As a partial check, use the facts that the graph has at most n 
x-intercepts and at most 
turning points. Multiplicity of
zeros can also be considered in order to check where the graph
crosses or is tangent to the x-axis. We can also check the graph
with a graphing calculator.
EXAMPLE 2
Graph the polynomial function
.
Solution
1. The leading term is 
. The degree, 3, is odd, and the coefficient, 2, is
positive. Thus the end behavior of the graph will appear as follows.
2. To find the zeros, we solve 
. Here we can use factoring 
by grouping.

The zeros are

6. The degree of f is 3. The graph of f can have at most 3 x-intercepts and
at most 2 turning points. It has 3 x-intercepts and 2 turning points.
Each zero has a multiplicity of 1; thus the graph crosses the x-axis at 2,
, and 2. The graph has the end behavior described in step (1). As
,
, and as 
,
. The graph appears to
be correct.
Some polynomials are difficult to factor. In the next example, the
polynomial is given in factored form. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we will 
learn methods that facilitate determining factors of such polynomials.
EXAMPLE 3
Graph the polynomial function
.
Solution
1. The leading term is 
. The degree, 4, is even, and the coefficient, 1, is
positive. The sketch below shows the end behavior.
2. To find the zeros, we solve 
:
.
The zeros are 1, 2, and 4; 2 is of multiplicity 2; the others are of multi-
plicity 1. The x-intercepts are 
,
, and 
.
3. The zeros divide the x-axis into four intervals:
,
,
,
and
.
We choose a test value for x from each interval and find 
.

The test values and corresponding function values also give us four points
on the graph:
,
,
, and 
.
4. To determine the y-intercept, we find 
:
.
The y-intercept is 
.
5. We find a few additional points and draw the graph.
6. The degree of g is 4. The graph of g can have at most 4 x-intercepts and
at most 3 turning points. It has 3 x-intercepts and 3 turning points. One
of the zeros, 2, has a multiplicity of 2, so the graph is tangent to the 
x-axis at 2. The other zeros, 1 and 4, each have a multiplicity of 1 so
the graph crosses the x-axis at 1 and 4. The graph has the end behav-
ior described in step (1). As 
and as 
,
. The
graph appears to be correct.
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Polynomial functions P are continuous, hence their graphs are unbroken.
The domain of a polynomial function, unless restricted by the statement
of the function, is 
. Suppose two function values 
and 
have opposite signs. Since P is continuous, its graph must be a curve from
to 
without a break. Then it follows that the curve must
cross the x-axis at some point c between a and b—that is, the function has
a zero at c between a and b.

The Intermediate Value Theorem
For any polynomial function 
with real coefficients, suppose that
for 
,
and 
are of opposite signs. Then the function has
a real zero between a and b.
EXAMPLE 4
Using the intermediate value theorem, determine, if pos-
sible, whether the function has a real zero between a and b.
a)
;
,
b)
;
,
c)
;
,
d)
;
,
Solution
We find 
and 
or 
and 
and determine whether
they differ in sign. The graphs of
and 
at left provide a visual check
of the conclusions.
a)
,
Note that 
is negative and 
is positive. By the intermediate
value theorem, since 
and 
have opposite signs, then 
has
a zero between 4 and 2. The graph confirms this.
b)
,
Both 
and 
are positive. Thus the intermediate value theorem
does not allow us to determine whether there is a real zero between 1
and 3. Note that the graph of
shows that there are two zeros between
1 and 3.
c)
,
Since 
and 
have opposite signs,
has a zero between 
and . The graph confirms this.
d)
,
Both 
and 
are negative. This does not necessarily mean that
there is not a zero between 1 and 2. The graph of
does show that
there are no zeros between 1 and 2, but the function values 
and 
do not allow us to use the intermediate value theorem to determine this.

Perform long division with polynomials and determine whether one
polynomial is a factor of another.
Use synthetic division to divide a polynomial by 
.
Use the remainder theorem to find a function value 
.
Use the factor theorem to determine whether

.
In general, finding exact zeros of many polynomial functions is neither easy
nor straightforward. In this section and the one that follows, we develop
concepts that help us find exact zeros of certain polynomial functions with
degree 3 or greater.
Consider the polynomial
.
The factors are
,
,
and
,
and the zeros are
3,
1,
and
2.
When a polynomial is expressed in factored form, each factor determines a
zero of the function. Thus if we know the factors of a polynomial, we can
easily find the zeros. We now show how this idea can be “reversed” so that if
we know the zeros of a polynomial function, we can find the factors of the
polynomial.
Division and Factors
When we divide one polynomial by another, we obtain a quotient and a re-
mainder. If the remainder is 0, then the divisor is a factor of the dividend.

Since the remainder is 0, we know that 
is a factor of
. In fact, we know that
.
We also have
Remainder
Since the remainder is not 0, we know that 
is not a factor of
.
When we divide a polynomial 
by a divisor 
, a polynomial 
is the quotient and a polynomial 
is the remainder. The remainder must
either be 0 or have degree less than that of
.
As in arithmetic, to check a division, we multiply the quotient by the
divisor and add the remainder, to see if we get the dividend. Thus these
polynomials are related as follows:
Dividend
Divisor
Quotient
Remainder
For example, if
and 
, as in
Example 1, then 
and 
, and
24
.
The Remainder Theorem and Synthetic Division
Consider the function
.
When we divided 
by 
and 
in Example 1, the remainders
were 0 and 24, respectively. Let’s now find the function values 
and 
:
;
.
Note that the function values are the same as the remainders. This suggests
the following theorem.

The Remainder Theorem
If a number c is substituted for x in the polynomial 
, then the
result 
is the remainder that would be obtained by dividing 
by 
. That is, if
, then 
.
PROOF (OPTIONAL).
The equation 
, where
, is the basis of this proof. If we divide 
by 
, we 
obtain a quotient 
and a remainder 
related as follows:
.
The remainder 
must either be 0 or have degree less than 
. Thus,
must be a constant. Let’s call this constant R. The equation above is
true for any replacement of x, so we replace x with c. We get
.
Thus the function value 
is the remainder obtained when we divide
by 
.
The remainder theorem motivates us to find a rapid way of dividing
by 
in order to find function values. To streamline division, we can
arrange the work so that duplicate and unnecessary writing is avoided.
Consider the following:

The division in (B) is the same as that in (A), but we wrote only the coeffi-
cients. The color numerals are duplicated, so we look for an arrangement in
which they are not duplicated. In place of the divisor in the form 
, we
can simply use c and then add rather than subtract. When the procedure is
“collapsed,” we have the algorithm known as synthetic division.

We “bring down” the 4. Then we multiply it by the 2 to get 8 and add to get
5. We then multiply 5 by 2 to get 10, add, and so on. The last number, 29, is
the remainder. The others, 4, 5, and 11, are the coefficients of the quotient,
. (Note that the degree of the quotient is 1 less than the 
degree of the dividend when the degree of the divisor is 1.)
When using synthetic division, we write a 0 for a missing term in 
the dividend.

Study Tip
The new mathematical skills and
concepts presented in lectures 
will be of increased value to you 
if you begin the homework
assignment as soon as possible
after the lecture. Then if you still
have difficulty with any of the
exercises, you have time to access
supplementary resources such as:
Student’s Solution Manual.
Videotapes.
InterAct Math Tutorial 
CD-ROM.
Note: We must write a 0
for the missing term.

Finding Factors of Polynomials

The Factor Theorem
For a polynomial

PROOF (OPTIONAL).
If we divide 
by 
, we obtain a quotient and a
remainder, related as follows:
.
Then if
, we have
,
so

The factor theorem is very useful in factoring polynomials and hence in
solving polynomial equations and finding zeros of polynomial functions. If
we know a zero of a polynomial function, we know a factor.

Since

, is another. Thus,
.
The trinomial is easily factored in this case, so we have

Our goal is to solve the equation

zero products:

Theorems about
Zeros of
Polynomial
Functions
Find a polynomial with specified zeros.
For a polynomial function with integer coefficients, find the rational
zeros and the other zeros, if possible.
Use Descartes’ rule of signs to find information about the number of real
zeros of a polynomial function with real coefficients.
We will now allow the coefficients of a polynomial to be complex numbers.
In certain cases, we will restrict the coefficients to be real numbers, rational
numbers, or integers, as shown in the following examples.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
A linear, or first-degree, polynomial function 
(where 
)
has just one zero,
. It can be shown that any quadratic polynomial
function with complex numbers for coefficients has at least one, and at most
two, complex zeros. The following theorem is a generalization. No proof is
given in this text.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Every polynomial function of degree n, with 
, has at least one
zero in the system of complex numbers.
Note that although the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that
a zero exists, it does not tell how to find it. Recall that the zeros of a polyno-
mial function 
are the solutions of the polynomial equation 
.
We now develop some concepts that can help in finding zeros. First, we con-
sider one of the results of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
Every polynomial function f of degree n, with 
, can be factored 
into n linear factors (not necessarily unique); that is,
.

Finding Polynomials with Given Zeros
Given several numbers, we can find a polynomial function with those
numbers as its zeros.
EXAMPLE 1
Find a polynomial function of degree 3, having the zeros 1,
3i, and 3i.
Solution
Such a function has factors 
,
, and 
, so we
have
.
The number 
can be any nonzero number. The simplest function will be
obtained if we let it be 1. If we then multiply the factors, we obtain
Multiplying 
.
EXAMPLE 2
Find a polynomial function of degree 5 with 1 as a zero of
multiplicity 3, 4 as a zero of multiplicity 1, and 0 as a zero of multiplicity 1.
Solution
Proceeding as in Example 1, letting 
, we obtain
.
Zeros of Polynomial Functions with Real Coefficients
Consider the quadratic equation 
, with real coefficients.
Its solutions are 
and 
. Note that they are complex conjugates.
This generalizes to any polynomial with real coefficients.
If a complex number 
,
, is a zero of a polynomial
function 
with real coefficients, then its conjugate,
, is 
also a zero. (Nonreal zeros occur in conjugate pairs.)
In order for the preceding to be true, it is essential that the coefficients
be real numbers.
Rational Coefficients
When a polynomial has rational numbers for coefficients, certain irrational
zeros also occur in pairs, as described in the following theorem.
If
, where a and b are rational and c is not a perfect square,
is a zero of a polynomial function 
with rational coefficients, then
is also a zero.

EXAMPLE 3
Suppose that a polynomial function of degree 6 with ra-
tional coefficients has 
, 2i, and 
as three of its zeros.
Find the other zeros.
Solution
Since the coefficients are rational, and thus real, the other zeros
are the conjugates of the given zeros,
, 2i, and 
. There are no
other zeros because a polynomial function of degree 6 can have at most 
6 zeros.
EXAMPLE 4
Find a polynomial function of lowest degree with rational
coefficients that has 
and 
as two of its zeros.
Solution
The function must also have the zeros 
and 
. Be-
cause we want to find the polynomial function of lowest degree with the
given zeros, we will not include additional zeros. That is, we will write a
polynomial function of degree 4. Thus, if we let 
, the polynomial
function is
.
Integer Coefficients and 
the Rational Zeros Theorem
It is not always easy to find the zeros of a polynomial function. However,
if a polynomial function has integer coefficients, there is a procedure that
will yield all the rational zeros.
The Rational Zeros Theorem
Let
,
where all the coefficients are integers. Consider a rational number
denoted by 
, where p and q are relatively prime (having no
common factor besides 1 and 1). If

p is a factor of

We could use the TABLE feature or some other method to find function

becomes a beneficial by-product if a zero is found. Rather than use syn-
thetic division to check each of these possibilities, we graph the function
and inspect the graph for zeros that appear to be near any of the possible
rational zeros. (See the graph at left.)
From the graph, we see that of the possibilities in the list, only the

We now solve the equation 
to determine the zeros. We use the
principle of zero products:
.
There is only one rational zero, . The other zeros are 
and 
.
b) The factorization into linear factors is
.
Descartes’ Rule of Signs
The development of a rule that helps determine the number of positive
real zeros and the number of negative real zeros of a polynomial function
is credited to the French mathematician René Descartes. To use the rule,
we must have the polynomial arranged in descending or ascending order,
with no zero terms written in, the leading coefficient positive, and the
constant term not 0. Then we determine the number of variations of sign,
that is, the number of times, in reading through the polynomial, that suc-
cessive coefficients are of different signs.
EXAMPLE 7
Determine the number of variations of sign in the polyno-
mial function 
.
Solution
We have
From positive to
Both positive; no variation
negative; a variation
From negative to positive;
a variation
The number of variations of sign is 2.
Note the following:
.
We see that the number of variations of sign in 
is 1. It occurs as we
go from 
to 4.

We now state Descartes’ rule, without proof.
Descartes’ Rule of Signs
Let 
written in descending or ascending order be a polynomial
function with real coefficients and a nonzero constant term. The
number of positive real zeros of
is either:
1. The same as the number of variations of sign in 
, or
2. Less than the number of variations of sign in 
by a positive even
integer.
The number of negative real zeros of
is either:
3. The same as the number of variations of sign in 
, or
4. Less than the number of variations of sign in 
by a positive
even integer.
A zero of multiplicity m must be counted m times.
In each of Examples 8–10, what does Descartes’ rule of signs tell 
you about the number of positive real zeros and the number of negative
real zeros?
EXAMPLE 8
Solution
The number of variations of sign in 
is 2. Therefore, the
number of positive real zeros is either 2 or less than 2 by 2, 4, 6, and so on.
Thus the number of positive real zeros is either 2 or 0, since a negative num-
ber of zeros has no meaning.
The number of variations of sign in 
is 1. Thus there is exactly 1 nega-
tive real zero. Since nonreal, complex conjugates occur in pairs, we also know
the possible ways in which nonreal zeros might occur. The table shown at left 
summarizes all the possibilities for real and nonreal zeros of
.
EXAMPLE 9
Solution
There are 4 variations of sign. Thus the number of positive real
zeros is either
4
or
or
.
That is, the number of positive real zeros is 4, 2, or 0.
There are 0 changes in sign, so there are no negative real zeros.

EXAMPLE 10
Solution
As written, the polynomial does not satisfy the conditions of
Descartes’ rule of signs because the constant term is 0. But because x is a fac-
tor of every term, we know that the polynomial has 0 as a zero. We can then
factor as follows:
.
Now we analyze 
and 
. The
number of variations of sign in 
is 1. Therefore, there is exactly 1 posi-
tive real zero. The number of variations of sign in 
is 2. Thus the num-
ber of negative real zeros is 2 or 0. The same results apply to 
.

Functions
For a rational function, find the domain and graph the function,
identifying all of the asymptotes.
Solve applied problems involving rational functions.
Now we turn our attention to functions that represent the quotient of
two polynomials. Whereas the sum, difference, or product of two poly-
nomials is a polynomial, in general the quotient of two polynomials is 
not itself a polynomial.
A rational number can be expressed as the quotient of two integers,
,
where 
. A rational function is formed by the quotient of two polyno-
mials,
, where 
. Here are some examples of rational func-
tions and their graphs.
Rational Function
A rational function is a function f that is a quotient of two
polynomials, that is,
,
where 
and 
are polynomials and where 
is not the 
zero polynomial. The domain of f consists of all inputs x for 
which

The Domain of a Rational Function
EXAMPLE 1
Consider
.
Find the domain and graph f.
Solution
When the denominator 
is 0, we have 
, so the only
input that results in a denominator of 0 is 3. Thus the domain is
, or 
.
The graph of this function is the graph of
translated to the right
3 units. Two versions of the graph on a graphing calculator are shown below.
Using CONNECTED mode can lead to an incorrect graph. In CON-
NECTED mode, a graphing calculator connects plotted points with line seg-
ments. In DOT mode, it simply plots unconnected points. In the first graph,
the graphing calculator has connected the points plotted on either side of the
x-value 3 with a line that appears to be the vertical line 
. (It is not ac-
tually vertical since it connects the last point to the left of
with the first
point to the right of
.) Since 3 is not in the domain of the function, the
vertical line 
cannot be part of the graph. We will see later in this sec-
tion that vertical lines like 
, although not part of the graph, are impor-
tant in the construction of graphs. If you have a choice when graphing
rational functions, use DOT mode.
EXAMPLE 2
Determine the domain of each of the functions illustrated
at the beginning of this section.
Solution
The domain of each rational function will be the set of all real
numbers except those values that make the denominator 0. To determine
those exceptions, we set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x.

As a partial check of the domains, we can observe the discontinuities
(breaks) in the graphs of these functions. (See page 304.)
Asymptotes
Look at the graph of
, shown at left. (Also see Example 1.)
Let’s explore what happens as x-values get closer and closer to 3 from the
left. We then explore what happens as x-values get closer and closer to 3
from the right.
From left:
From right:
We see that as x-values get closer and closer to 3 from the left, the func-
tion values (y-values) decrease without bound (that is, they approach nega-
tive infinity,
). Similarly, as the x-values approach 3 from the right, the
function values increase without bound (that is, they approach positive in-
finity,
). We write this as
as 
and
as 
.
We read “
as 
” as “
decreases without bound as x ap-
proaches 3 from the left.” We read “
as 
” as “
increases
without bound as x approaches 3 from the right.”The notation 
means
that x gets as close to 3 as possible without being equal to 3. The vertical line
is said to be a vertical asymptote for this curve.

The vertical asymptotes of a rational function 
are
found by determining the zeros of
that are not also zeros of
. If
and 
are polynomials with no common factors other than constants, we
need determine only the zeros of the denominator 
.
Determining Vertical Asymptotes
For a rational function 
, where 
and 
are
polynomials with no common factors other than constants, if a is a
zero of the denominator, then the line 
is a vertical asymptote
for the graph of the function.
EXAMPLE 3
Determine the vertical asymptotes for the graph of each
of the following functions.
a)
b)
Solution
a) We factor to find the zeros of the denominator:
. The zeros of the denominator are 4 and 2.
Thus the vertical asymptotes are the lines 
and 
.
(See Fig. 1.)
b) We factor to find the zeros of the denominator:
. Solving
we get
.
The zeros of the denominator are 0,
, and

vertical asymptotes are the lines

Looking again at the graph of
, shown at left (also see
Example 1), let’s explore what happens to 
as x increases
without bound (approaches positive infinity,
) and as x decreases without
bound (approaches negative infinity,
).
x increases without bound:
x decreases without bound:
We see that
as 
and
as 
.
Since 
is the equation of the x-axis, we say that the curve approaches
the x-axis asymptotically and that the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote for
the curve.
In general, the line 
is a horizontal asymptote for the graph of f
if either or both of the following are true:
as 
or
as 
.
The following figures illustrate four ways in which horizontal asymptotes
can occur. In each case, the curve gets close to the line 
either as 
or as 
. Keep in mind that the symbols 
and 
convey the idea
of increasing without bound and decreasing without bound, respectively.

How can we determine a horizontal asymptote? As x gets very large 
or very small, the value of the polynomial function 
is dominated by
the function’s leading term. Because of this, if
and 
have the same
degree, the value of
as 
or as 
is dominated by
the ratio of the numerator’s leading coefficient to the denominator’s lead-
ing coefficient.

For 
, we see that the numerator,
is dominated by 
and the denominator,
is
dominated by 
so 
approaches 
or 
as x gets very large or
very small:
, or 1.5, as 
,
and
, or 1.5, as 
.
We say that the curve approaches the horizontal line 
asymptotically
and that 
is a horizontal asymptote for the curve.
It follows that when the numerator and the denominator of a rational
function have the same degree, the line 
is the horizontal asymptote,
where a and b are the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denomi-
nator, respectively.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the horizontal asymptote:
.
Solution
The numerator and the denominator have the same degree.
The ratio of the leading coefficients is 
, so the line 
or 
is the horizontal asymptote.
To check Example 4, we could use a graphing calculator to evaluate the
function for a very large and a very small value of x. (See the window at left.)
Another check, one that is useful in calculus, is to multiply by 1, using
:
.
As 
becomes very large, each expression with a power of x in the denomi-
nator tends toward 0. Specifically, as 
or as 
, we have
,
or
.
The horizontal asymptote is 
, or 
.
We now investigate the occurrence of a horizontal asymptote when
the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.

EXAMPLE 5
Find the horizontal asymptote:
.
Solution
We let 
,
, and 
. Note that as 
, the value of
grows much faster than
the value of
. Because of this, the ratio 
shrinks toward 0.
As 
, the ratio 
behaves in a similar manner. The hori-
zontal asymptote is 
, the x-axis. This is the case for all rational func-
tions for which the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the
denominator. Note in Example 1 that 
, the x-axis, is the horizontal
asymptote of
.
The following statements describe the two ways in which a horizontal
asymptote occurs.
Determining a Horizontal Asymptote
When the numerator and the denominator of a rational function
have the same degree, the line 
is the horizontal
asymptote, where a and b are the leading coefficients of the
numerator and the denominator, respectively.
When the degree of the numerator of a rational function is less
than the degree of the denominator, the x-axis, or 
, is the
horizontal asymptote.
When the degree of the numerator of a rational function is
greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no
horizontal asymptote.
The following statements are also true.
The graph of a rational function never crosses a vertical asymptote.
The graph of a rational function might cross a horizontal asymptote
but does not necessarily do so.
EXAMPLE 6
Graph
.
Include and label all asymptotes.
Solution
Since 0 is the zero of the denominator, the y-axis,
, is 
the vertical asymptote. Note also that the degree of the numerator is the
same as the degree of the denominator. Thus,
, or 2, is the hori-
zontal asymptote.
To draw the graph, we first draw the asymptotes with dashed lines.
Then we compute and plot some ordered pairs and draw the two branches
of the curve. We can check the graph with a graphing calculator.

Sometimes a line that is neither horizontal nor vertical is an asymptote.
Such a line is called an oblique asymptote, or a slant asymptote.
EXAMPLE 7
Find all the asymptotes of
.
Solution
The line 
is the vertical asymptote because 2 is the zero of
the denominator. There is no horizontal asymptote because the degree of the
numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. When the degree
of the numerator is 1 greater than the degree of the denominator, we divide
to find an equivalent expression:
.
Now we see that when

oblique asymptote.

Occurrence of Lines as Asymptotes of Rational Functions
For a rational function 
, where 
and 
have
no common factors other than constants:
Vertical asymptotes occur at any x-values that make the
denominator 0.
The x-axis is the horizontal asymptote when the degree of the
numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.
A horizontal asymptote other than the x-axis occurs when the
numerator and the denominator have the same degree.
An oblique asymptote occurs when the degree of the numerator
is 1 greater than the degree of the denominator.
There can be only one horizontal asymptote or one oblique 
asymptote and never both.
An asymptote is not part of the graph of the function.
The following is an outline of a procedure that we can follow to create
accurate graphs of rational functions.
To graph a rational function 
, where 
and 
have no common factor other than constants:
1. Find the real zeros of the denominator. Determine the domain of
the function and sketch any vertical asymptotes.
2. Find the horizontal or the oblique asymptote, if there is one, and
sketch it.
3. Find the zeros of the function. The zeros are found by
determining the zeros of the numerator. These are the first
coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph.
4. Find 
. This gives the y-intercept 
, of the function.
5. Find other function values to determine the general shape. Then
draw the graph.

The graph has vertical asymptotes 
and 
. We sketch these as
dashed lines.
2. Because the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the 
denominator, the x-axis,
, is the horizontal asymptote.
3. To find the zeros of the numerator, we solve 
and get
. Thus,
is the zero of the function, and the pair 
is the x-intercept.
4. We find 
:
.
Thus,
is the y-intercept.
5. We find other function values to determine the general shape and then
draw the graph. Note that the graph of this function crosses its horizon-
tal asymptote at 
.
EXAMPLE 9
Graph:
.
Solution
1. We find the zeros of the denominator by solving 
. Since
,
the zeros are 3 and 2. Thus the domain excludes the x-values 3 and 2
and is
.
The graph has vertical asymptotes 
and 
. We sketch these as
dashed lines.
2. The numerator and the denominator have the same degree, so the hor-
izontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients:
, or 1. Thus 
is the horizontal asymptote. We sketch 
it with a dashed line.

3. To find the zeros of the numerator, we solve

shown below crosses its oblique asymptote 
. Remember, graphs
can cross horizontal or oblique asymptotes, but they cannot cross 
vertical asymptotes.
Let’s now graph a rational function 
, where 
and
have a common factor.
EXAMPLE 10
Graph:
.
Solution
We first express the denominator in factored form:
.
The domain of the function is 
, or 
. The zeros of the denominator are 1 and 2, and the zero
of the numerator is 2. Since 1 is the only zero of the denominator that is
not a zero of the numerator, the graph of the function has 
as its only
vertical asymptote. The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the
denominator, so 
is the horizontal asymptote. There are no zeros of the
function and thus no x-intercepts, because 2 is the only zero of the numera-
tor and 2 is not in the domain of the function. Since 
,
is the
y-intercept. We draw the graph indicating the “hole” when 
with an
open circle.

Solve polynomial and rational inequalities.
We will use a combination of algebraic and graphical methods to solve poly-
nomial and rational inequalities.
Polynomial Inequalities
Just as a quadratic equation can be written in the form 
, a quadratic inequality can be written in the form 
, where 
is 
,
,
, or 
. Here are some examples of quadratic
inequalities:
,
.
Quadratic inequalities are one type of polynomial inequality. Other 
examples of polynomial inequalities are
,
,
and
.
When the inequality symbol in a polynomial inequality is replaced with an
equals sign, a related equation is formed. Polynomial inequalities can be
easily solved once the related equation has been solved.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve:
.
Solution
We are asked to find all x-values for which 
. To locate
these values, we graph 
. Then we note that whenever the func-
tion changes sign, its graph passes through an x-intercept. Thus to solve
, we first solve the related equation 
to find all zeros
of the function:
.
The zeros are 1, 0, and 1. Thus the x-intercepts of the graph are 
,
, and 
, as shown in the figure at left. The zeros divide the x-axis
into four intervals:
,
,
,
and
.

For all x-values within a given interval, the sign of
must be 
either positive or negative. To determine which, we choose a test value for
x from each interval and find 
. We can use the TABLE feature set in ASK
mode to determine the sign of
in each interval. (See the table at left.)
We can also determine the sign of
in each interval by simply looking
at the graph of the function.

Since we are solving 
, the solution set consists of only two of
the four intervals, those in which the sign of
is positive. We see that the
solution set is 
, or 
.
To solve a polynomial inequality:
1. Find an equivalent inequality with 0 on one side.
2. Solve the related polynomial equation.
3. Use the solutions to divide the x-axis into intervals. Then select a
test value from each interval and determine the polynomial’s sign
on the interval.
4. Determine the intervals for which the inequality is satisfied and
write interval notation or set-builder notation for the solution set.
Include the endpoints of the intervals in the solution set if the
inequality symbol is 
or 
.

Polynomial and Rational Functions
Algebraic Solution
To solve the related equation
,
we need to use the theorems of Section 3.4. We
solved this equation in Example 5 in Section 3.4.
The solutions are
1,
,
,
and
,
or approximately
1,
0.586,
0.667,
and
3.414.
These numbers divide the x-axis into five intervals:
,
,
,
, and 
.
We then let 
and, using test values for 
, determine the sign of
in each interval:
Function values are negative in the intervals
and 
. Since the
inequality sign is 
, we include the endpoints of the
intervals in the solution set. The solution set is
,
or
.
Graphical Solution
We graph 
using a view-
ing window that reveals the curvature of the graph.
Using the ZERO feature, we see that two of the
zeros are 
and approximately 3.414 
However, this window leaves us uncertain
about the number of zeros of the function in the in-
terval 
The following window shows another
view of the zeros in the interval 
Those zeros
are about 0.586 and 0.667 
The intervals to be considered are 
and
We note on the graph where the func-
tion is negative. Then including appropriate end-
points, we find that the solution set is approximately

The following is a method for solving rational inequalities.
To solve a rational inequality:
1. Find an equivalent inequality with 0 on one side.
2. Change the inequality symbol to an equals sign and solve the 
related equation.
3. Find values of the variable for which the related rational function
is not defined.
4. The numbers found in steps (2) and (3) are called critical values.
Use the critical values to divide the x-axis into intervals. Then test
an x-value from each interval to determine the function’s sign in
that interval.
5. Select the intervals for which the inequality is satisfied and write
interval notation or set-builder notation for the solution set. If the
inequality symbol is 
or 
, then the solutions to step (2) should
be included in the solution set. The x-values found in step (3) are
never included in the solution set.
It works well to use a combination of algebraic and graphical methods
to solve polynomial and rational inequalities. The algebraic methods give
exact numbers for the critical values, and the graphical methods allow us to
see easily what intervals satisfy the inequality.

Find equations of direct, inverse, and combined variation given values of
the variables.
Solve applied problems involving variation.
We now extend our study of formulas and functions by considering applica-
tions involving variation.
Direct Variation
Suppose an executive chef earns $23 per hour. In 1 hr, $23 is earned; in 2 hr,
$46 is earned; in 3 hr, $69 is earned; and so on. This gives rise to a set of
ordered pairs of numbers:
,
,
,
,
and so on. Note that the ratio of the second coordinate to the first is the same
number for each pair:
,
,
,
,
and so on.
Whenever a situation produces pairs of numbers in which the ratio is
constant, we say that there is direct variation. Here the amount earned E
varies directly as the time worked t:
(a constant),
or
,
or, using function notation,
. This equation is an equation of
direct variation. The coefficient, 23 in the situation above, is called the
variation constant. In this case, it is the rate of change of earnings with
respect to time.
Direct Variation
If a situation gives rise to a linear function 
, or 
,
where k is a positive constant, we say that we have direct variation,
or that y varies directly as x, or that y is directly proportional 
to x. The number k is called the variation constant, or constant 
of proportionality.

EXAMPLE 2
Water from Melting Snow.
The number of centimeters W
of water produced from melting snow varies directly as S, the number of
centimeters of snow. Meteorologists have found that 150 cm of snow will
melt to 16.8 cm of water. To how many centimeters of water will 200 cm
of snow melt?
Solution
We can express the amount of water as a function of the amount
of snow. Thus,
, where k is the variation constant. We first find k
using the given data and then find an equation of variation:
W varies directly as S.
Substituting 150 for S
Replacing 
with 16.8
Solving for k
.
This is the variation constant.
The equation of variation is 
.
Next, we use the equation to find how many centimeters of water will
result from melting 200 cm of snow:
Substituting
.
Thus, 200 cm of snow will melt to 22.4 cm of water.

Inverse Variation
Suppose a bus is traveling a distance of 20 mi. At a speed of 5 mph, the
trip will take 4 hr; at 10 mph, it will take 2 hr; at 20 mph, it will take 1 hr;
at 40 mph, it will take 
hr; and so on. We plot this information on a
graph, using speed as the first coordinate and time as the second coordi-
nate to determine a set of ordered pairs:
,
,
,
,
and so on.
Note that the products of the coordinates are all the same number:
,
,
,
,
and so on.
Whenever a situation produces pairs of numbers in which the product 
is constant, we say that there is inverse variation. Here the time varies 
inversely as the speed:
(a constant),
or
,
or, using function notation,
. This equation is an equation of
inverse variation. The coefficient, 20 in the situation above, is called the
variation constant. Note that as the first number increases, the second
number decreases.
Inverse Variation
If a situation gives rise to a function 
, or 
, where
k is a positive constant, we say that we have inverse variation, or
that y varies inversely as x, or that y is inversely proportional 
to x. The number k is called the variation constant, or constant
of proportionality.

Polynomial and Rational Functions
There are many problems that translate to an equation of inverse
variation.
EXAMPLE 4
Framing a House.
The time t required to do a job varies
inversely as the number of people P who work on the job (assuming that
all work at the same rate). If it takes 72 hr for 9 people to frame a house,
how long will it take 12 people to complete the same job?
Solution
We can express the amount of time required, in hours, as a func-
tion of the number of people working. Thus we have 
. We first
find k using the given information and then find an equation of variation:
t varies inversely as P.
Substituting 9 for P
Replacing 
with 72
Solving for k
.
This is the variation constant.
The equation of variation is 
.
Next, we use the equation to find the time that it would take 12 people
to do the job. We compute 
:
Substituting
.
Thus it would take 54 hr for 12 people to complete the job.
Combined Variation
We now look at other kinds of variation.
y varies directly as the nth power of x if there is some positive
constant k such that
.
y varies inversely as the nth power of x if there is some positive
constant k such that
.
y varies jointly as x and z if there is some positive constant k
such that

There are other types of combined variation as well. Consider the for-
mula for the volume of a right circular cylinder,
, in which V, r,
and h are variables and 
is a constant. We say that V varies jointly as h and
the square of r.
EXAMPLE 5
Find an equation of variation in which y varies directly as
the square of x, and 
when 
.
Solution
We write an equation of variation and find k:
Substituting
.
Thus,
.
EXAMPLE 6
Find an equation of variation in which y varies jointly as x
and z, and 
when 
and

Solution
We have
Substituting

Thus,
.
EXAMPLE 7
Find an equation of variation in which y varies jointly as x
and z and inversely as the square of w, and 
when 
,
,
and 
.
Solution
We have
Substituting

Thus,
.
Many applied problems can be modeled using equations of combined
variation.

The Indiana
Household Hazardous Waste Task Force was awarded
the 2002 National Community Recycling Leadership
Award, with special recognition given to Monroe
County Solid Waste Management District. Monroe
County, Indiana, with a population of 9880, collected
4445 lb of rechargeable batteries in a recent recycling

The x-axis is the horizontal asymptote when the
degree of the numerator is less than the degree
of the denominator.
A horizontal asymptote other than the x-axis
occurs when the numerator and the
denominator have the same degree.
An oblique asymptote occurs when the degree
of the numerator is 1 greater than the degree
of the denominator.

Determine whether a function is one-to-one, and if it is, find a formula
for its inverse.
Simplify expressions of the type 
and 
.
Inverses
When we go from an output of a function back to its input or inputs, we
get an inverse relation. When that relation is a function, we have an in-
verse function.
Consider the relation h given as follows:
.
Suppose we interchange the first and second coordinates. The relation we
obtain is called the inverse of the relation h and is given as follows:
Inverse of
.
Inverse Relation
Interchanging the first and second coordinates of each ordered pair
in a relation produces the inverse relation.
EXAMPLE 1
Consider the relation g given by
.
Graph the relation in blue. Find the inverse and graph it in red.
Solution
The relation g is shown in blue in the figure at left. The inverse
of the relation is
and is shown in red. The pairs in the inverse are reflections across the 
line 
.
Inverse Relation
If a relation is defined by an equation, interchanging the variables
produces an equation of the inverse relation.

EXAMPLE 2
Find an equation for the inverse of the relation:
.
Solution
We interchange x and y and obtain an equation of the inverse:
.
If a relation is given by an equation, then the solutions of the inverse can
be found from those of the original equation by interchanging the first and
second coordinates of each ordered pair. Thus the graphs of a relation and
its inverse are always reflections of each other across the line 
. This is
illustrated with the equations of Example 2 in the tables and graph below.
We will explore inverses and their graphs later in this section.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
Suppose we reverse the arrows. Are these inverse relations functions?
We see that the inverse of the postage function is not a function. Like
all functions, each input in the postage function has exactly one output.
However, the output for both 1983 and 1984 is 20. Thus in the inverse of
the postage function, the input 20 has two outputs, 1983 and 1984. When
two or more inputs of a function have the same output, the inverse rela-
tion cannot be a function. In the cubing function, each output corre-
sponds to exactly one input, so its inverse is also a function. The cubing
function is an example of a one-to-one function.
If the inverse of a function f is also a function, it is named 
(read
“f-inverse”).
The 1 in 
is not an exponent!
Do not misinterpret the 1 in 
as a negative exponent:
does not
mean the reciprocal of f and 
is not equal to 
.
One-to-One Functions
A function f is one-to-one if different inputs have different outputs—
that is,
if
,
then
.
Or a function f is one-to-one if when the outputs are the same, the
inputs are the same—that is,
if
,
then
.

Properties of One-to-One Functions and Inverses
If a function is one-to-one, then its inverse is a function.
The domain of a one-to-one function f is the range of the 
inverse 
.
The range of a one-to-one function f is the domain of the 
inverse 
.
A function that is increasing over its domain or is decreasing
over its domain is a one-to-one function.
EXAMPLE 3
Given the function f described by 
, prove
that f is one-to-one (that is, it has an inverse that is a function).
Solution
To show that f is one-to-one, we show that if
, then
. Assume that 
for a and b in the domain of f. Since
and 
, we have
Adding 3
.
Dividing by 2
Thus, if
, then 
. This shows that f is one-to-one.
EXAMPLE 4
Given the function g described by 
, prove that g is
not one-to-one.
Solution
We can prove that g is not one-to-one by finding two numbers a
and b for which 
and 
. Two such numbers are 3 and 3,
because 
and 
. Thus g is not one-to-one.
The following graphs show a function, in blue, and its inverse, in red. To
determine whether the inverse is a function, we can apply the vertical-line test
to its graph. By reflecting each such vertical line back across the line 
,
we obtain an equivalent horizontal-line test for the original function.

function more than once, then the function is not one-to-one 
and its inverse is not a function.

REASON
No horizontal line intersects the
graph more than once.
There are many horizontal lines
that intersect the graph more than
once. Note that where the line
intersects the graph, the first
coordinates are 
and 2.
Although these are different inputs,
they have the same output, 4.

Finding Formulas for Inverses
Suppose that a function is described by a formula. If it has an inverse that is
a function, we proceed as follows to find a formula for 
.
Obtaining a Formula for an Inverse
If a function f is one-to-one, a formula for its inverse can generally
be found as follows:
1. Replace 
with y.
2. Interchange x and y.
3. Solve for y.
4. Replace y with 
.
EXAMPLE 6
Determine whether the function 
is one-to-
one, and if it is, find a formula for 
.
Solution
The graph of f is shown at left. It passes the horizontal-line test.
Thus it is one-to-one and its inverse is a function. We also proved that f is
one-to-one in Example 3. We find a formula for 
.
1. Replace 
with y:
2. Interchange x and y:
3. Solve for y:
4. Replace y with 
:
.
Consider
and
from Example 6. For the input 5, we have
.
The output is 7. Now we use 7 for the input in the inverse:
.
The function f takes the number 5 to 7. The inverse function 
takes the
number 7 back to 5.

Solution
The graphs of f and 
are shown at left. They are graphed in a
square window. Note that the graph of
can be drawn by reflecting the
graph of f across the line 
. That is, if we were to graph 
in wet ink and fold along the line 
, the graph of
would be formed by the ink transferred from f.
When we interchange x and y in finding a formula for the inverse of
we are in effect reflecting the graph of that function across
the line 
. For example, when the coordinates of the y-intercept,
of the graph of f are reversed, we get the x-intercept,
of the
graph of
The graph of
is a reflection of the graph of f across the 
line 
.
On some graphing calculators, we can graph the inverse of a function
after graphing the function itself by accessing a drawing feature. Consult
your user’s manual or the Graphing Calculator Manual that accompanies this
text for the procedure.
EXAMPLE 8
Consider 
.
a) Determine whether the function is one-to-one.
b) If it is one-to-one, find a formula for its inverse.
c) Graph the function and its inverse.
Solution
a) The graph of
is shown at left. It passes the horizontal-line
test and thus has an inverse that is a function. We also know that 
is
one-to-one because it is an increasing function over its entire domain.
b) We follow the procedure for finding an inverse.
1. Replace 
with y:
2. Interchange x and y:
3. Solve for y:
4. Replace y with 
:
.
c) To find the graph, we reflect the graph of
across the 
line 
. This can be done by plotting points or by using a graphing
calculator.

Inverse Functions and Composition
Suppose that we were to use some input a for a one-to-one function f and
find its output,
. The function 
would then take that output back to
a. Similarly, if we began with an input b for the function 
and found its
output,
, the original function f would then take that output back to
b. This is summarized as follows.
If a function f is one-to-one, then 
is the unique function such
that each of the following holds:
,
for each x in the domain of
f, and
,
for each x in the domain of
.
EXAMPLE 9
Given that 
, use composition of functions to
show that

each is x:

Restricting a Domain
In the case in which the inverse of a function is not a function, the domain
of the function can be restricted to allow the inverse to be a function. We
saw in Examples 4 and 5(b) that 
is not one-to-one. The graph
is shown at left.
Suppose that we had tried to find a formula for the inverse as follows:
Replacing 
with y
Interchanging x and y
.
Solving for y
This is not the equation of a function. An input of, say, 4 would yield two
outputs, 2 and 2. In such cases, it is convenient to consider “part” of the
function by restricting the domain of
. For example, if we restrict the
domain of
to nonnegative numbers, then its inverse is a function,
as shown with the graphs of

below.

Graphing Exponential Functions
We now define exponential functions. We assume that 
has meaning 
for any real number x and any positive real number a and that the laws of
exponents still hold, though we will not prove them here.
Exponential Function
The function 
, where x is a real number,
and 
,
is called the exponential function, base a.
We require the base to be positive in order to avoid the complex
numbers that would occur by taking even roots of negative numbers—
an example is 
, the square root of 1, which is not a real number.
The restriction 
is made to exclude the constant function 
, which does not have an inverse because it is not one-to-one.
The following are examples of exponential functions:
,
,
.
Note that, in contrast to functions like 
and 
in which
the variable is the base of an exponential expression, the variable in an 
exponential function is in the exponent.

Let’s now consider graphs of exponential functions.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph the exponential function
.
Solution
We compute some function values and list the results in a table
(at left).
;
;
;
;
;
;
.
Next, we plot these points and connect them with a smooth curve. Be sure
to plot enough points to determine how steeply the curve rises.
Note that as x increases, the function values increase without bound.
As x decreases, the function values decrease, getting close to 0. That is,
as 
,
. Thus the x-axis, or the line 
, is a horizontal 
asymptote. As the x-inputs decrease, the curve gets closer and closer to 
this line, but does not cross it.
EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Check the graph of
using
a graphing calculator. Then graph 
Use the TRACE and TABLE
features to confirm that the graph never crosses the x-axis.

Applications
Graphing calculators are especially helpful when working with exponential
functions. They not only facilitate computations but they also allow us to 
visualize the functions. One of the most frequent applications of exponen-
tial functions occurs with compound interest.
EXAMPLE 4
Compound Interest.
The amount of money A that a prin-
cipal P will grow to after t years at interest rate r (in decimal form), com-
pounded n times per year, is given by the formula
.
Suppose that $100,000 is invested at 6.5% interest, compounded 
semiannually.
a) Find a function for the amount of money after t years.
b) Graph the function.
c) Find the amount of money in the account at

Solution
a) Since 
,
, and 
, we can substitute
these values and write the following function:
.
b) For the graph shown at left, we use the viewing window 
because of the large numbers and the fact that negative time values and
amounts of money have no meaning in this application.
c) We can compute function values using function notation on the home
screen of a graphing calculator. (See the window at left.) We can also cal-
culate the values directly on a graphing calculator by substituting in the
expression for 
;
;
;
.
d) To find the amount of time it takes for the account to grow to $400,000,
we set
and solve for t. One way we can do this is by graphing the equations
and
Then we can use the Intersect method to estimate the first coordinate of the
point of intersection. (See Fig. 1 below.)

The Number e
We now consider a very special number in mathematics. In 1741, Leonhard
Euler named this number e. Though you may not have encountered it be-
fore, you will see here and in future mathematics that it has many important
applications. To explain this number, we use the compound interest formula
in Example 4. Suppose that $1 is invested at 100% inter-
est for 1 yr. The formula above becomes a function A defined in terms of the
number of compounding periods n. Since 
,
, and 
,
.
Let’s visualize this function with its graph shown below and explore the
values of
as 
. Consider the graph for larger and larger values of
n. Does this function have a horizontal asymptote?
Let’s find some function values using a calculator.
It appears from these values that the graph does have a horizontal 
asymptote,
. As the values of n get larger and larger, the function
values get closer and closer to the number Euler named e. Its decimal 
representation does not terminate or repeat; it is irrational.

Graph logarithmic functions.
Find common and natural logarithms with and without a calculator.
Convert between exponential and logarithmic equations.
Change logarithm bases.
We now consider logarithmic, or logarithm, functions. These functions are
inverses of exponential functions and have many applications.
Graphing Logarithmic Functions
We have noted that every exponential function (with 
and 
) is
one-to-one. Thus such a function has an inverse that is a function. In this
section, we will name these inverse functions logarithmic functions and
use them in applications. For now, we draw their graphs by interchanging
x and y.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph:

Solution
Note that x is alone on one side of the equation. We can find
ordered pairs that are solutions by choosing values for y and then com-
puting the corresponding x-values.

Study Tip
Try being a tutor for a fellow
student. Understanding and
retention of the concepts can 
be maximized when you explain
the material to someone else.
Later, however, we will learn how to approximate this expression using 
a calculator.
For any exponential function 
, its inverse is called a loga-
rithmic function, base a. The graph of the inverse can be obtained by 
reflecting the graph of

It is helpful in dealing with logarithmic functions to remember that a loga-

think to yourself,“the logarithm, base a, of a number x is the power to which
a must be raised to get x.”
We are led to the following. (The symbol 
means that the two state-
ments are equivalent; that is, when one is true, the other is true. The words
“if and only if” can be used in place of

Finding Logarithms on a Calculator
Before calculators became so widely available, base-10 logarithms, or com-
mon logarithms, were used extensively to simplify complicated calcula-
tions. In fact, that is why logarithms were invented. The abbreviation log,
with no base written, is used to represent common logarithms, or base-10
logarithms. Thus,
means
.
For example,
means 
. Let’s compare 
with 
and 
:
Since 29 is between 10 and 100, it seems
reasonable that log 29 is between 1 and 2.
On a calculator, the key for common logarithms is generally marked 
.
Using that key, we find that
rounded to four decimal places. Since 
, our answer seems
reasonable. This also tells us that

Changing Logarithmic Bases
Most calculators give the values of both common logarithms and natural
logarithms. To find a logarithm with a base other than 10 or e, we can use
the following conversion formula.
The Change-of-Base Formula
For any logarithmic bases a and b, and any positive number M,

Using a calculator
Since 
is the power to which we raise 5 to get 8, we would expect this
power to be greater than 1 (

Solution
To graph 
, we select values for x and use the 
key on a calculator to find the corresponding values of

points and draw the curve. We can graph the function 
directly
using a graphing calculator. See the window at left.
We could also write

EXAMPLE 12
Walking Speed.
In a study by psychologists Bornstein and
Bornstein, it was found that the average walking speed w, in feet per second, of
a person living in a city of population P, in thousands, is given by the function
(Source: International Journal of Psychology).
a) The population of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is 1,517,600. Find the
average walking speed of people living in Philadelphia.
b) The population of Salem, Oregon, is 137,000. Find the average walking
speed of people living in Salem.
c) Graph the function.
d) A sociologist computes the average walking speed in a city to be ap-
proximately 2.0 ftsec. Use this information to estimate the population
of the city.
Solution
a) Since P is in thousands and 
thousand, we substitute
1517.6 for P:

The average walking speed of people living in Philadelphia is about 
2.8 
.
b) We substitute 137 for P:
.
The average walking speed of people living in Salem is about 1.9 
.
c) We graph with a viewing window of
because inputs are very
large and outputs are very small by comparison.
d) To find the population for which the average walking speed is 2.0
we substitute 2.0 for 
and solve for P.
We will use the Intersect method. We graph the equations 
and 
and use the INTERSECT feature to approxi-
mate the point of intersection. (See the window at left.) We see that in a
city in which the average walking speed is 2.0
the population is
about 194.5 thousand, or 194,500.
EXAMPLE 13
Earthquake Magnitude.
The magnitude R, measured on
the Richter scale, of an earthquake of intensity I is defined as
,
where 
is a minimum intensity used for comparison. We can think of
as
a threshold intensity that is the weakest earthquake that can be recorded on
a seismograph. If one earthquake is 10 times as intense as another, its mag-
nitude on the Richter scale is 1 greater than that of the other. If one earth-
quake is 100 times as intense as another, its magnitude on the Richter scale
is 2 higher, and so on. Thus an earthquake whose magnitude is 7 on the
Richter scale is 10 times as intense as an earthquake whose magnitude is 6.
Earthquake intensities can be interpreted as multiples of the minimum in-
tensity .
The earthquake in Ahmedabad, India, on January 26, 2001, had an in-
tensity of
. What was its magnitude on the Richter scale?
Solution
We substitute into the formula:
.
The magnitude of the earthquake was 7.9 on the Richter scale.

97. Loudness of Sound.
The loudness L, in bels (after 
Alexander Graham Bell), of a sound of intensity I is
defined to be
,
where 
is the minimum intensity detectable by
the human ear (such as the tick of a watch at 20 ft
under quiet conditions). If a sound is 10 times as
intense as another, its loudness is 1 bel greater
than that of the other. If a sound is 100 times as
intense as another, its loudness is 2 bels greater,
and so on. The bel is a large unit, so a subunit, the
decibel, is generally used. For L, in decibels, the
formula is
.
Find the loudness, in decibels, of each sound with
the given intensity.

We now establish some properties of logarithmic functions. These proper-
ties are based on the corresponding rules for exponents.
Logarithms of Products
The first property of logarithms corresponds to the product rule for expo-
nents:
.
The Product Rule
For any positive numbers M and N and any logarithmic base a,
.
(The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the
factors.)

Logarithms of Powers

Logarithms of Quotients
The third property of logarithms corresponds to the quotient rule for expo-
nents:
.
The Quotient Rule
For any positive numbers M and N, and any logarithmic base a,

Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

It is possible that when encountering an equation like the one in Ex-
ample 4, you might not recognize that it could be solved in the algebraic
manner shown. This points out the value of the graphical solution.
Solving Logarithmic Equations
Equations containing variables in logarithmic expressions, such as
and 
, are called logarithmic equa-
tions. To solve logarithmic equations algebraically, we first try to obtain 
a single logarithmic expression on one side and then write an equivalent
exponential equation.

Solve applied problems involving exponential growth and decay, and
compound interest.
Find models involving exponential and logarithmic functions.
Exponential and logarithmic functions with base e are rich in applications to
many fields such as business, science, psychology, and sociology.
Population Growth
The function
,
is a model of many kinds of population growth, whether it be a population
of people, bacteria, cellular phones, or money. In this function,
is the
population at time 0, P is the population after time t, and k is called the ex-
ponential growth rate. The graph of such an equation is shown at left.
EXAMPLE 1
Population Growth of India.
In 2002, the population of
India was about 1034 million and the exponential growth rate was 1.4% per
year (Source: Statistical Abstract of the United States).
a) Find the exponential growth function.
b) Graph the exponential growth function.
c) Estimate the population in 2008.
d) After how long will the population be double what it was in 2002?
Solution
a) At 
(2002), the population was 1034 million. We substitute 1034 for
and 1.4%, or 0.014, for k to obtain the exponential growth function
,
where t is the number of years after 2002 and 
is in millions.
b) Using a graphing calculator, we obtain the graph of the exponential
growth function, shown at left.
c) In 2008,
; that is, 6 yr have passed since 2002. To find the popula-
tion in 2008, we substitute 6 for t:
.
We can also use the VALUE feature from the CALC menu on a graph-
ing calculator to find 
. (See the window at left.) The population will
be about 1125 million, or 1,125,000,000, in 2008.
d) We are looking for the time T for which 
, or 2068. The
number T is called the doubling time. To find T, we solve the equation
using both an algebraic method and a graphical method.

Interest Compounded Continuously
Here we explore the mathematics behind the concept of interest com-
pounded continuously. Suppose that an amount 
is invested in a savings
account at interest rate k compounded continuously. The amount 
in the
account after t years is given by the exponential function
.
EXAMPLE 2
Interest Compounded Continuously.
Suppose that $2000 is
invested at interest rate k, compounded continuously, and grows to $2504.65
in 5 yr.
a) What is the interest rate?
b) Find the exponential growth function.
c) What will the balance be after 10 yr?
d) After how long will the $2000 have doubled?
Solution
a) At

. Thus the exponential growth function is
of the form

World Population Growth.
The population of the world is
now doubling every 63 yr. What is the exponential growth rate?
Solution
We have

The growth rate of the world population is about 1.1% per year.
Models of Limited Growth
The model 
,
, has many applications involving unlimited
population growth. However, in some populations, there can be factors that
prevent a population from exceeding some limiting value—perhaps a limi-
tation on food, living space, or other natural resources. One model of such
growth is
.
This is called a logistic function. This function increases toward a limit-
ing value a as

EXAMPLE 4
Limited Population Growth.
A ship carrying 1000 passen-
gers has the misfortune to be shipwrecked on a small island from which the
passengers are never rescued. The natural resources of the island limit the
population to 5780. The population gets closer and closer to this limiting
value, but never reaches it. The population of the island after time t, in years,
is given by the logistic function
.
a) Graph the function.
b) Find the population after 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 yr.
Solution
a) We use a graphing calculator to graph the function. The graph is 
the S-shaped curve shown at left above. Note that this function increases
toward a limiting value of 5780. The graph has 
as a horizontal 
asymptote.
b) We can use the TABLE feature on a graphing calculator set in ASK mode
to find the function values. (See the window on the left below.) The
VALUE feature can also be used. (See the window on the right below.)
Thus the population will be about 1000 after 0 yr, 1375 after 1 yr, 1836
after 2 yr, 3510 after 5 yr, 5315 after 10 yr, and 5771 after 20 yr.
Another model of limited
growth is provided by the 
function
,
,
which is shown graphed at right.
This function also increases
toward a limiting value L, as

Study Tip
Newspapers and magazines are
full of mathematical applications,
many of which follow the
exponential model. Find an
application and share it with your
class. As you obtain higher math
skills, you will more readily observe
the world from a mathematical
perspective. Math courses become
more interesting when we connect
the concepts to the real world.

Exponential Decay
The function
,
is an effective model of the decline, or decay, of a population. An example is
the decay of a radioactive substance. In this case,
is the amount of the
substance at time 
, and 
is the amount still radioactive after time t,
where k is a positive constant that depends on the situation. The constant k
is called the decay rate.
The half-life of bismuth is 5 days. This means that half of an amount of
bismuth will cease to be radioactive in 5 days. The effect of half-life T is
shown in the graph below for nonnegative inputs. The exponential function
gets close to 0, but never reaches 0, as t gets very large. Thus, according to an
exponential decay model, a radioactive substance never completely ceases to
be radioactive.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
How can scientists determine that an ani-
mal bone has lost 30% of its carbon-14?
The assumption is that the percentage 
of carbon-14 in the atmosphere and in
living plants and animals is the same.
When a plant or an animal dies,
the amount of carbon-14 decays
exponentially. The scientist burns the
animal bone and uses a Geiger counter
to determine the percentage of the smoke
that is carbon-14. It is the amount that
this varies from the percentage in the
atmosphere that tells how much 
carbon-14 has been lost.
The process of carbon-14 dating
was developed by the American chemist
Willard E. Libby in 1952. It is known
that the radioactivity in a living plant is
16 disintegrations per gram per minute.
Since the half-life of carbon-14 is 5750
years, an object with an activity of 8
disintegrations per gram per minute is
5750 years old, one with an activity of 4
disintegrations per gram per minute is
11,500 years old, and so on. Carbon-14
dating can be used to measure the age of
objects up to 40,000 years old. Beyond
such an age, it is too difficult to measure
the radioactivity and some other method
would have to be used.
Carbon-14 was used to find the age 
of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It was also used 
to refute the authenticity of the Shroud
of Turin, presumed to have covered the
body of Christ.

EXAMPLE 5
Carbon Dating.
The radioactive element carbon-14 has a
half-life of 5750 yr. The percentage of carbon-14 present in the remains of
organic matter can be used to determine the age of that organic matter.
Archaeologists discovered that the linen wrapping from one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls had lost 22.3% of its carbon-14 at the time it was found. How
old was the linen wrapping?
Solution
We first find k. When 
(the half-life),
will be half
of
. We substitute 
for 
and 5750 for t in the exponential decay
model and solve for k. Then
Dividing by 
Taking the natural logarithm on both sides
.
Then
.
We could also solve the equation 
using a graphing calculator.
Now we have the function
.
(This function can be used for any subsequent carbon-dating problem.) If
the linen wrapping has lost 22.3% of its carbon-14 from an initial amount
, then 
is the amount present. To find the age t of the wrapping,
we solve the following equation for t:
Substituting 
for P
Dividing by 
and writing 
77.7% as 0.777
Taking the natural logarithm 
on both sides
Dividing by 0.00012
.
Thus the linen wrapping on the Dead Sea Scrolls was about 2103 yr old when
it was found.

In 1947, a Bedouin youth looking for a
stray goat climbed into a cave at Kirbet
Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea
near Jericho and came upon earthenware
jars containing an incalculable treasure 
of ancient manuscripts. Shown here are
fragments of those manuscripts, called the
Dead Sea Scrolls, a portion of some 600 or
so texts found so far and which concern the
Jewish books of the Bible. Officials date
them before 70 A.D., making them the
oldest Biblical manuscripts by 1000 years.

Now, when we analyze a set of data for curve fitting, these models can
be considered as well as polynomial functions (such as linear, quadratic,
cubic, and quartic functions) and rational functions.
EXAMPLE 6
Debit Card Volume.
The total debit card volume has in-
creased dramatically in recent years, as shown in the table at left.
a) Use a graphing calculator to fit an exponential function to the data.
b) Graph the function with the scatterplot of the data.
c) Predict the total debit card volume in 2007.
Solution
a) We will fit an equation of the type 
to the data, where x is the
number of years since 1997. Entering the data into the calculator and car-
rying out the regression procedure, we find that the equation is
.
See Fig. 1. The correlation coefficient is very close to 1. This gives us an
indication that the exponential function fits the data well.

estimate that the total debit card volume in 2007 will be about $3676 bil-
lion, or about $3,676,000,000,000.
On some graphing calculators, there may be a REGRESSION feature that
yields an exponential function, base e. If not, and you wish to find such a
function, a conversion can be done using the following.
Converting from Base b to Base e
Then, for the equation in Example 6, we have

The Trigonometric Functions
5.1
Trigonometric
Functions of
Acute Angles
Determine the six trigonometric ratios for a given acute angle of a 
right triangle.
Determine the trigonometric function values of 30, 45, and 60.
Using a calculator, find function values for any acute angle, and given a
function value of an acute angle, find the angle.
Given the function values of an acute angle, find the function values of
its complement.
The Trigonometric Ratios
We begin our study of trigonometry by considering right triangles and
acute angles measured in degrees. An acute angle is an angle with mea-
sure greater than 0 and less than 90. Greek letters such as 
(alpha),
(beta),
(gamma),
(theta), and 
(phi) are often used to denote an
angle. Consider a right triangle with one of its acute angles labeled .
The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The other 
sides of the triangle are referenced by their position relative to the acute
angle . One side is opposite 
and one is adjacent to .
The lengths of the sides of the triangle are used to define the six
trigonometric ratios:
sine (sin),
cosecant (csc),
cosine (cos),
secant (sec),
tangent (tan),
cotangent (cot).
The sine of  is the length of the side opposite 
divided by the length
of the hypotenuse (see Fig. 1):
.
The ratio depends on the measure of angle 
and thus is a function of
.
The notation 
actually means 
, where sin, or sine, is the name
of the function.
The cosine of  is the length of the side adjacent to 
divided by the
length of the hypotenuse (see Fig. 2):
.
The six trigonometric ratios, or trigonometric functions, are defined as
follows.

reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent function values, respectively.

If we know the values of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions of an
angle, we can use these reciprocal relationships to find the values of the
cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions of that angle.

Triangles are said to be similar if their corresponding angles have
the same measure. In similar triangles, the lengths of corresponding sides
are in the same ratio. The right triangles shown below are similar. Note
that the corresponding angles are equal and the length of each side of the
second triangle is four times the length of the corresponding side of the
first triangle.
Let’s observe the sine, cosine, and tangent values of
in each triangle.
Can we expect corresponding function values to be the same?

The Trigonometric Functions
Study Tip
Success on the next exam can 
be planned. Include study time
(even if only 30 minutes a day) in
your daily schedule and commit to
making this time a priority. Choose
a time when you are most alert
and a setting in which you can
concentrate. You will be surprised
how much more you can learn and
retain if study time is included
each day rather than in one long
session before the exam.

ratios are the same. This must be the case because in order for the sine,
cosine, and tangent to be functions, there must be only one output (the
ratio) for each input (the angle ).
The trigonometric function values of
depend only on the measure
of the angle, not on the size of the triangle.
The Six Functions Related
We can find the other five trigonometric function values of an acute angle
when one of the function-value ratios is known.
EXAMPLE 3
If
and 
is an acute angle, find the other five
trigonometric function values of

Solution
We know from the definition of the sine function that the ratio
is
.
Using this information, let’s consider a right triangle in which the 
hypotenuse has length 7 and the side opposite 
has length 6. To find the
length of the side adjacent to , we recall the Pythagorean theorem:
.
We now use the lengths of the three sides to find the other five ratios:

Function Values of 30, 45, and 60
In Examples 1 and 3, we found the trigonometric function values of an
acute angle of a right triangle when the lengths of the three sides were

30, 45, and 60, which are frequently seen in applications, we can use
geometry to determine the function values.
A right triangle with a 45 angle actually has two 45 angles. Thus the
triangle is isosceles, and the legs are the same length. Let’s consider such 
a triangle whose legs have length 1. Then we can find the length of its 
hypotenuse, c, using the Pythagorean theorem as follows:
,
or
,
or
.
Such a triangle is shown below. From this diagram, we can easily deter-
mine the trigonometric function values of 45.
,
,
It is sufficient to find only the function values of the sine, cosine, and 
tangent, since the others are their reciprocals.
It is also possible to determine the function values of 30 and 60. A
right triangle with 30 and 60 acute angles is half of an equilateral tri-
angle, as shown in the following figure. Thus if we choose an equilateral
triangle whose sides have length 2 and take half of it, we obtain a right 
triangle that has a hypotenuse of length 2 and a leg of length 1. The other
leg has length a, which can be found as follows:
.
We can now determine the function values of 30 and 60:
,
,
,
,
,
.
Since we will often use the function values of 30, 45, and 60, either the
triangles that yield them or the values themselves should be memorized.

Let’s now use what we have learned about trigonometric functions of
special angles to solve problems. We will consider such applications in
greater detail in Section 5.2.
EXAMPLE 4
Height of a Hot-air Balloon.
As a hot-air balloon began to
rise, the ground crew drove 1.2 mi to an observation station. The initial
observation from the station estimated the angle between the ground and
the line of sight to the balloon to be 30. Approximately how high was the
balloon at that point? (We are assuming that the wind velocity was low
and that the balloon rose vertically for the first few minutes.)
Solution
We begin with a drawing of the situation. We know the measure
of an acute angle and the length of its adjacent side.
Since we want to determine the length of the opposite side, we can use
the tangent ratio, or the cotangent ratio. Here we use the tangent ratio:
Substituting;
.
The balloon is approximately 0.7 mi, or 3696 ft, high.

Function Values of Any Acute Angle
Historically, the measure of an angle has been expressed in degrees,
minutes, and seconds. One minute, denoted 
, is such that 
,
or 
. One second, denoted 
, is such that 
, or
. Then 61 degrees, 27 minutes, 4 seconds could be written as
6127	4
. This DMS form was common before the widespread use of
scientific calculators. Now the preferred notation is to express fractional
parts of degrees in decimal degree form. Although the DM	S
 notation 
is still widely used in navigation, we will most often use the decimal form 
in this text.
Most calculators can convert DM	S
 notation to decimal degree 
notation and vice versa. Procedures among calculators vary.
EXAMPLE 5
Convert 542	30
 to decimal degree notation.
Solution
We can use a graphing calculator set in DEGREE mode to convert
between DM	S
 form and decimal degree form. (See window at left.)
To convert DM	S
 form to decimal degree form, we enter 542	30
using the ANGLE menu for the degree and minute symbols and 
for the symbol representing seconds. Pressing 
gives us
,
rounded to the nearest hundredth of a degree.
Without a calculator, we can convert as follows:
;
;
.
EXAMPLE 6
Convert 72.18 to DM	S
 notation.
Solution
To convert decimal degree form to DM	S
 form, we enter 72.18
and access the DMS feature in the ANGLE menu. The result is

Without a calculator, we can convert as follows:
.
So far we have measured angles using degrees. Another useful unit 
for angle measure is the radian, which we will study in Section 5.4. Calcu-
lators work with either degrees or radians. Be sure to use whichever mode is
appropriate. In this section, we use the degree mode.
Keep in mind the difference between an exact answer and an approxi-
mation. For example,
.
This is exact!
But using a calculator, you get an answer like
.
This is an approximation!
Calculators generally provide values only of the sine, cosine, and 
tangent functions. You can find values of the cosecant, secant, and co-
tangent by taking reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions,
respectively.
EXAMPLE 7
Find the trigonometric function value, rounded to four
decimal places, of each of the following.
a) tan 29.7
b) sec 48
c) sin 8410	39
Solution
a) We check to be sure that the calculator is in DEGREE mode. The function
value is
.
Rounded to four decimal places
b) The secant function value can be found by taking the reciprocal of the

EXAMPLE 8
Find the acute angle, to the nearest tenth of a degree,
whose sine value is approximately 0.20113.
Solution
With a graphing calculator set in DEGREE mode, we first enter
the equation 
. With a minimum value of 0 and a step-value of 0.1,
we scroll through the table of values looking for the y-value closest to
0.20113.
We find that 11.6 is the angle whose sine value is about 0.20113.
The quickest way to find the angle with a calculator is to use an inverse
function key. (We first studied inverse functions in Section 4.1 and will con-
sider inverse trigonometric functions in Section 6.4.) First check to be sure
that your calculator is in DEGREE mode. Usually two keys must be pressed in
sequence. For this example, if we press
.20113 
,
we find that the acute angle whose sine is 0.20113 is approximately
11.60304613, or 11.6.
EXAMPLE 9
Ladder Safety.
A paint crew has purchased new 30-ft ex-
tension ladders. The manufacturer states that the safest placement on a
wall is to extend the ladder to 25 ft and to position the base 6.5 ft from 
the wall. (Source: R. D. Werner Co., Inc.) What angle does the ladder 
make with the ground in this position?
Solution
We make a drawing and then use the most convenient trigono-
metric function. Because we know the length of the side adjacent to 
and
the length of the hypotenuse, we choose the cosine function.
From the definition of the cosine function, we have
.
Using a calculator, we find the acute angle whose cosine is 0.26:
.
Pressing 
0.26 
Thus when the ladder is in its safest position, it makes an angle of about
75 with the ground.
Cofunctions and Complements
We recall that two angles are complementary whenever the sum of their
measures is 90. Each is the complement of the other. In a right triangle,

Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles

the acute angles are complementary, since the sum of all three angle 
measures is 180 and the right angle accounts for 90 of this total. Thus 
if one acute angle of a right triangle is , the other is 
.
The six trigonometric function values of each of the acute angles in
the triangle below are listed at the right. Note that 53 and 37 are com-
plementary angles since 
.
Try this with the acute, complementary angles 20.3 and 69.7 as well.
What pattern do you observe? Look for this same pattern in Example 1
earlier in this section.
Note that the sine of an angle is also the cosine of the angle’s com-
plement. Similarly, the tangent of an angle is the cotangent of the angle’s
complement, and the secant of an angle is the cosecant of the angle’s 
complement. These pairs of functions are called cofunctions. A list of
cofunction identities follows.

Solve applied problems involving right triangles and trigonometric
functions.
Solving Right Triangles
Now that we can find function values for any acute angle, it is possible to
solve right triangles. To solve a triangle means to find the lengths of all
sides and the measures of all angles.
EXAMPLE 1
In 
(shown at left), find a, b, and B, where a and b
represent lengths of sides and B represents the measure of
. Here we
use standard lettering for naming the sides and angles of a right triangle:
Side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, where a and b are the
legs, and side c, the hypotenuse, is opposite angle C, the right angle.
Solution
In 
, we know three of the measures:
,
,
,
,
,
.
Since the sum of the angle measures of any triangle is 180 and 
,
the sum of A and B is 90. Thus,
.
We are given an acute angle and the hypotenuse. This suggests that 
we can use the sine and cosine ratios to find a and b, respectively:
and
.
Solving for a and b, we get
and

EXAMPLE 2
In 
(shown at left), find D and F. Then find d.
Solution
In 
, we know three of the measures:
,
,
,
,
,
.
We know the side adjacent to D and the hypotenuse. This suggests the 
use of the cosine ratio:
.
We now find the angle whose cosine is 
. To the nearest hundredth 
of a degree,
.
Pressing 
Since the sum of D and F is 90, we can find F by subtracting:
.
We could use the Pythagorean theorem to find d, but we will use a
trigonometric function here. We could use cos F, sin D, or the tangent or
cotangent ratios for either D or F. Let’s use tan D:
,
or
.
Then

The six measures are

Applications
Right triangles can be used to model and solve many applied problems in
the real world.

Hiking at the Grand Canyon.
A backpacker hiking east
along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon notices an unusual rock for-
mation directly across the canyon. She decides to continue watching the
landmark while hiking along the rim. In 2 hr, she has gone 6.2 mi due 
east and the landmark is still visible but at approximately a 50 angle to
the North Rim. (See the figure at left.)

Solution
a) We know the side adjacent to the 50 angle and want to find the hy-
potenuse. We can use the cosine function:
.
After hiking 6.2 mi, she is approximately 9.6 mi from the rock formation.
b) We know the side adjacent to the 50 angle and want to find the opposite
side. We can use the tangent function:
.
Thus it is approximately 7.4 mi across the canyon from her starting
point.
Many applications with right triangles involve an angle of elevation
or an angle of depression. The angle between the horizontal and a line of
sight above the horizontal is called an angle of elevation. The angle be-
tween the horizontal and a line of sight below the horizontal is called an
angle of depression. For example, suppose that you are looking straight
ahead and then you move your eyes up to look at an approaching air-
plane. The angle that your eyes pass through is an angle of elevation. If
the pilot of the plane is looking forward and then looks down, the pilot’s
eyes pass through an angle of depression.

experience that the best photo is taken at a height of approximately 475 ft
and a distance of 850 ft from the farmhouse. What is the angle of depres-
sion from the plane to the house?
Solution
When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior
angles are equal. Thus the angle of depression from the plane to the
house,
, is equal to the angle of elevation from the house to the plane,

so we can use the right triangle shown in the figure. Since we know the 
side opposite 
and the hypotenuse, we can find 
by using the sine
function. We first find 
.
Using a calculator in DEGREE mode, we find the acute angle whose sine is ap-
proximately 0.5588:
.
Pressing 
0.5588 
Thus the angle of depression is approximately 34.
EXAMPLE 5
Cloud Height.
To measure cloud height at night, a vertical
beam of light is directed on a spot on the cloud. From a point 135 ft away
from the light source, the angle of elevation to the spot is found to be
67.35. Find the height of the cloud.
Solution
From the figure, we have
.
The height of the cloud is about 324 ft.
Some applications of trigonometry involve the concept of direction,
or bearing. In this text we present two ways of giving direction, the first
below and the second in Exercise Set 5.3.
Bearing: First-Type
One method of giving direction, or bearing, involves reference to a
north–south line using an acute angle. For example, N55W means 
55 west of north and S67E means 67 east of south.

EXAMPLE 7
Comiskey Park.
In the new Comiskey Park, the home
of the Chicago White Sox baseball team, the first row of seats in the
upper deck is farther away from home plate than the last row of seats
in the old Comiskey Park. Although there is no obstructed view in the
new park, some of the fans still complain about the present distance
from home plate to the upper deck of seats. (Source: Chicago Tribune,
September 19, 1993) From a seat in the last row of the upper deck 
directly behind the batter, the angle of depression to home plate is
29.9, and the angle of depression to the pitcher’s mound is 24.2.
Find (a) the viewing distance to home plate and (b) the viewing dis-
tance to the pitcher’s mound.
Solution
From geometry we know that 
and 
. The
standard distance from home plate to the pitcher’s mound is 60.5 ft. In 
the drawing, we let 
be the viewing distance to home plate,
the view-
ing distance to the pitcher’s mound, h the elevation of the last row, and x
the horizontal distance from the batter to a point directly below the seat
in the last row of the upper deck.
We begin by determining the distance x. We use the tangent function

17. Safety Line to Raft.
Each spring Bryan uses his 
vacation time to ready his lake property for the
summer. He wants to run a new safety line from
point B on the shore to the corner of the anchored
diving raft. The current safety line, which runs
perpendicular to the shore line to point A, is 40 ft
long. He estimates the angle from B to the corner of
the raft to be 50. Approximately how much rope

contact, the best angle between the front and back
legs of the easel is 23. How far from the wall should
the front legs be placed in order to obtain this angle?
About 2.5 ft
20. Height of a Tree.
A supervisor must train a new 
team of loggers to estimate the heights of trees.

42. Diameter of a Pipe.
A V-gauge is used to find the
diameter of a pipe. The advantage of such a device is
that it is rugged, it is accurate, and it has no moving
parts to break down. In the figure, the measure of
angle AVB is 54. A pipe is placed in the V-shaped
slot and the distance VP is used to estimate the
diameter. The line VP is calibrated by listing as its
units the corresponding diameters. This, in effect,
establishes a function between VP and d.
a) Suppose that the diameter of a pipe is 2 cm. What
is the distance VP?
About 1.96 cm

44. Measuring the Radius of the Earth.
One way to
measure the radius of the earth is to climb to the 
top of a mountain whose height above sea level is
known and measure the angle between a vertical 
line to the center of the earth from the top of the
mountain and a line drawn from the top of the
mountain to the horizon, as shown in the figure.
The height of Mt. Shasta in California is 14,162 ft.
From the top of Mt. Shasta, one can see the horizon
on the Pacific Ocean. The angle formed between a
line to the horizon and the vertical is found to be
8753	. Use this information to estimate the radius
of the earth, in miles.

Angles, Rotations, and Degree Measure
An angle is a familiar figure in the world around us.
Copyright © 2006 Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Addison-Wesley

An angle is the union of two rays with a common endpoint called 
the vertex. In trigonometry, we often think of an angle as a rotation. To
do so, think of locating a ray along the positive x-axis with its endpoint 
at the origin. This ray is called the initial side of the angle. Though we
leave that ray fixed, think of making a copy of it and rotating it. A ro-
tation counterclockwise is a positive rotation, and a rotation clockwise
is a negative rotation. The ray at the end of the rotation is called the 
terminal side of the angle. The angle formed is said to be in standard 
position.
The measure of an angle or rotation may be given in degrees. The
Babylonians developed the idea of dividing the circumference of a circle
into 360 equal parts, or degrees. If we let the measure of one of these 
parts be 1, then one complete positive revolution or rotation has a mea-
sure of 360. One half of a revolution has a measure of 180, one fourth of
a revolution has a measure of 90, and so on. We can also speak of an
angle of measure 60, 135, 330, or 420. The terminal sides of these 
angles lie in quadrants I, II, IV, and I, respectively. The negative rota-
tions 30, 110, and 225 represent angles with terminal sides in
quadrants IV, III, and II, respectively.

If two or more angles have the same terminal side, the angles are said
to be coterminal. To find angles coterminal with a given angle, we add or
subtract multiples of 360. For example, 420, shown above, has the same
terminal side as 60, since 
. Thus we say that angles of
measure 60 and 420 are coterminal. The negative rotation that measures
300 is also coterminal with 60 because 
. The set of
all angles coterminal with 60 can be expressed as 
, where 
n is an integer. Other examples of coterminal angles shown above are 90
and 270, 90 and 270, 135 and 225, 30 and 330, and 110
and 610.
EXAMPLE 1
Find two positive and two negative angles that are cotermi-
nal with (a) 51 and (b) 7.
Solution
a) We add and subtract multiples of 360. Many answers are possible.
Thus angles of measure 411, 1131, 309, and 669 are coterminal

b) We have the following:

For example, angles that measure 10 and 80 are complementary because

.
Thus the complement of 71.46 is 18.54 and the supplement is 108.54.
Trigonometric Functions of Angles or Rotations
Many applied problems in trigonometry involve the use of angles that are
not acute. Thus we need to extend the domains of the trigonometric 
functions defined in Section 5.1 to angles, or rotations, of any size. To do
this, we first consider a right triangle with one vertex at the origin of a 
coordinate system and one vertex on the positive x-axis. (See the figure 
at left.) The other vertex is at P, a point on the circle whose center is at 
the origin and whose radius r is the length of the hypotenuse of the tri-
angle. This triangle is a reference triangle for angle , which is in stan-
dard position. Note that y is the length of the side opposite 
and x is the
length of the side adjacent to .

Recalling the definitions in Section 5.1, we note that three of the
trigonometric functions of angle 
are defined as follows:

Since x and y are the coordinates of the point P and the length of the 
radius is the length of the hypotenuse, we can also define these functions
as follows:

We will use these definitions for functions of angles of any measure.

A reference triangle can be drawn for angles in any quadrant, as
shown. Note that the angle is in standard position; that is, it is always
measured from the positive half of the x-axis. The point 
is a 
point, other than the vertex, on the terminal side of the angle. Each of its
two coordinates may be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the lo-
cation of the terminal side. The length of the radius, which is also the 
length of the hypotenuse of the reference triangle, is always considered 
positive. Note that

Trigonometric Functions of Any Angle 
Suppose that 
is any point other than the vertex on the
terminal side of any angle in standard position, and r is the 
radius, or distance from the origin to 
. Then the 
trigonometric functions are defined as follows:
,
,
,
,
,
.
Values of the trigonometric functions can be positive, negative, or
zero, depending on where the terminal side of the angle lies. The length 
of the radius is always positive. Thus the signs of the function values 
depend only on the coordinates of the point P on the terminal side of
the angle. In the first quadrant, all function values are positive because
both coordinates are positive. In the second quadrant, first coordinates
are negative and second coordinates are positive; thus only the sine and
the cosecant values are positive. Similarly, we can determine the signs of
the function values in the third and fourth quadrants. Because of the 
reciprocal relationships, we need to learn only the signs for the sine, cosine,
and tangent functions.

Any point other than the origin on the terminal side of an angle 
in standard position can be used to determine the trigonometric func-
tion values of that angle. The function values are the same regardless 
of which point is used. To illustrate this, let’s consider an angle 
in 
standard position whose terminal side lies on the line 
. We 
can determine two second-quadrant solutions of the equation, find the
length r for each point, and then compare the sine, cosine, and tangent
function values using each point.

The trigonometric function values of

The Six Functions Related
When we know one of the function values of an angle, we can find the
other five if we know the quadrant in which the terminal side lies. The
procedure is to sketch a reference triangle in the appropriate quadrant,
use the Pythagorean theorem as needed to find the lengths of its sides,
and then find the ratios of the sides.
EXAMPLE 4
Given that 
and 
is in the second quadrant,
find the other function values.
Solution
We first sketch a second-quadrant angle. Since
,
Expressing 
as 
since  is in 
quadrant II
we make the legs lengths 2 and 3. The hypotenuse must then have length
, or 
. Now we read off the appropriate ratios:
,
or
,
,
,
or
,
,
,
.
Terminal Side on an Axis
An angle whose terminal side falls on one of the axes is a quadrantal
angle. One of the coordinates of any point on that side is 0. The defini-
tions of the trigonometric functions still apply, but in some cases, func-
tion values will not be defined because a denominator will be 0.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the sine, cosine, and tangent values for 90, 180,
270, and 360.
Solution
We first make a drawing of each angle in standard position
and label a point on the terminal side. Since the function values are 
the same for all points on the terminal side, we choose 
,

, and 
for convenience. Note that

In Example 5, all the values can be found using a calculator, but you
will find that it is convenient to be able to compute them mentally. It is
also helpful to note that coterminal angles have the same function values.
For example, 0 and 360 are coterminal; thus,

Trigonometric values can always be checked using a calculator. When
the value is undefined, the calculator will display an ERROR message.
Reference Angles: 30, 45, and 60
We can also mentally determine trigonometric function values whenever
the terminal side makes a 30, 45, or 60 angle with the x-axis. Consider,
for example, an angle of 150. The terminal side makes a 30 angle with
the x-axis, since

As the figure shows,

; therefore, the
ratios of the sides of the two triangles are the same. Thus the trigono-
metric function values are the same except perhaps for the sign. We 
could determine the function values directly from 
, but this is not
necessary. If we remember that in quadrant II, the sine is positive and 
the cosine and the tangent are negative, we can simply use the function
values of 30 that we already know and prefix the appropriate sign. Thus,

The reference angle for an angle is the acute angle formed by the

minal.
The reference angle for 60 is the acute angle formed by the 
terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. Thus the reference angle 
for 60 is 60. We know that since 780 is a fourth-quadrant angle,
the cosine is positive and the sine and the tangent are negative. Recall-
ing that

Function Values for Any Angle
When the terminal side of an angle falls on one of the axes or makes a 
30, 45, or 60 angle with the x-axis, we can find exact function values
without the use of a calculator. But this group is only a small subset of all
angles. Using a calculator, we can approximate the trigonometric func-
tion values of any angle. In fact, we can approximate or find exact func-
tion values of all angles without using a reference angle.

In many applications, we have a trigonometric function value and
want to find the measure of a corresponding angle. When only acute 
angles are considered, there is only one angle for each trigonometric 
function value. This is not the case when we extend the domain of the
trigonometric functions to the set of all angles. For a given function 
value, there is an infinite number of angles that have that function value.
There can be two such angles for each value in the range from 0 to 360.
To determine a unique answer in the interval 
, the quadrant in
which the terminal side lies must be specified.
The calculator gives the reference angle as an output for each func-
tion value that is entered as an input. Knowing the reference angle 
and the quadrant in which the terminal side lies, we can find the speci-
fied angle.
EXAMPLE 9
Given the function value and the quadrant restriction,
find .

,
b)
,
Solution
a) We first sketch the angle in the second quadrant. We use the calcula-
tor to find the acute angle (reference angle) whose sine is 0.2812. The
reference angle is approximately 16.33. We find the angle 
by sub-
tracting 16.33 from 180:
.
Thus,
.
b) We begin by sketching the angle in the fourth quadrant. Because the
tangent and cotangent values are reciprocals, we know that
.
We use the calculator to find the acute angle (reference angle) whose
tangent is 6.2073, ignoring the fact that 
is negative. The reference
angle is approximately 80.85. We find angle 
by subtracting 80.85
from 360:

Thus,

A point may travel completely around the circle and then continue.
For example, if it goes around once and then continues 
of the way
around, it will have traveled a distance of
, or 
(Fig. 5).
Every real number determines a point on the unit circle. For the positive
number 10, for example, we start at A and travel counterclockwise a 
distance of 10. The point at which we stop is the point “determined”
by the number 10. Note that 
and that 
. Thus 
the point for 10 travels around the unit circle about 
times (Fig. 6).

. (See the figure on the left below.) Since
, the point moves counterclockwise. The point goes com-
pletely around once and then continues of the way from A to B.
b) The number 
is negative, so the point moves clockwise. From 
A to B, the distance is , or 
, so we need to go beyond B another 
distance of

Radian Measure
Degree measure is a common unit of angle measure in many everyday 
applications. But in many scientific fields and in mathematics (calculus,
in particular), there is another commonly used unit of measure called 
the radian.
Consider the unit circle. Recall that this circle has radius 1. Suppose
we measure, moving counterclockwise, an arc of length 1, and mark a
point T on the circle.
If we draw a ray from the origin through T, we have formed an angle.
The measure of that angle is 1 radian. The word radian comes from the
word radius. Thus measuring 1 “radius” along the circumference of the
circle determines an angle whose measure is 1 radian. One radian is
about 57.3. Angles that measure 2 radians, 3 radians, and 6 radians are
shown below.

When we make a complete (counterclockwise) revolution, the termi-
nal side coincides with the initial side on the positive x-axis. We then 
have an angle whose measure is 
radians, or about 6.28 radians, which
is the circumference of the circle:

Thus a rotation of 360 (1 revolution) has a measure of
radians. A half
revolution is a rotation of 180, or 
radians. A quarter revolution is a ro-
tation of 90, or 
radians, and so on.

ANGLE menu.

With a calculator set in DEGREE mode, we can enter the angle measure

The radian–degree equivalents of the most commonly used angle
measures are illustrated in the following figures.
When a rotation is given in radians, the word “radians” is optional
and is most often omitted. Thus if no unit is given for a rotation, the
rotation is understood to be in radians.

We can also find coterminal, complementary, and supplementary 
angles in radian measure just as we did for degree measure in Section 5.3.
EXAMPLE 5
Find a positive angle and a negative angle that are coter-
minal with 
. Many answers are possible.
Solution
To find angles coterminal with a given angle, we add or sub-
tract multiples of

Thus,

Radian measure can be determined using a circle other than a unit 
circle. In the figure at left, a unit circle (with radius 1) is shown along 
with another circle (with radius r,
). The angle shown is a central
angle of both circles.
From geometry, we know that the arcs that the angle subtends have
their lengths in the same ratio as the radii of the circles. The radii of the
circles are r and 1. The corresponding arc lengths are s and 
. Thus we
have the proportion

Now 
is the radian measure of the rotation in question. It is common to
use a Greek letter, such as , for the measure of an angle or rotation and
the letter s for arc length. Adopting this convention, we rewrite the pro-
portion above as
.
In any circle, the measure (in radians) of a central angle, the arc length 
the angle subtends, and the length of the radius are related in this fashion.
Or, in general, the following is true.
Radian Measure
The radian measure
of a rotation is the ratio of the distance s
traveled by a point at a radius r from the center of rotation, to the
length of the radius r:
.
When using the formula 
,
must be in radians and s and
r must be expressed in the same unit.
EXAMPLE 7
Find the measure of a rotation in radians when a point 
2 m from the center of rotation travels 4 m.
Solution
We have

The unit is understood to be radians.

Find the length of an arc of a circle of radius 5 cm associ-
ated with an angle of
radians.
Solution
We have
,
or
.
Thus 
, or about 5.24 cm.
Linear Speed and Angular Speed
Linear speed is defined to be distance traveled per unit of time. If we 
use v for linear speed, s for distance, and t for time, then
.
Similarly, angular speed is defined to be amount of rotation per unit 
of time. For example, we might speak of the angular speed of a bicycle
wheel as 150 revolutions per minute or the angular speed of the earth 
as 
radians per day. The Greek letter 
(omega) is generally used for 
angular speed. Thus for a rotation 
and time t, angular speed is de-
fined as
.
As an example of how these definitions can be applied, let’s consider
the refurbished carousel at the Children’s Museum in Indianapolis, In-
diana. It consists of three circular rows of animals. All animals, regard-
less of the row, travel at the same angular speed. But the animals in the
outer row travel at a greater linear speed than those in the inner rows.
What is the relationship between the linear speed v and the angular 
speed 
?
To develop the relationship we seek, recall that, for rotations mea-
sured in radians,
. This is equivalent to
.
We divide by time, t, to obtain
Dividing by t
v
Now 
is linear speed v and 
is angular speed . Thus we have the 
relationship we seek,

Linear Speed in Terms of Angular Speed
The linear speed v of a point a distance r from the center of rotation
is given by
,
where 
is the angular speed in radians per unit of time.
For the formula 
, the units of distance for v and r must be the
same,
must be in radians per unit of time, and the units of time for
v and 
must be the same.
EXAMPLE 9
Linear Speed of an Earth Satellite.
An earth satellite in 
circular orbit 1200 km high makes one complete revolution every 
90 min. What is its linear speed? Use 6400 km for the length of a radius 
of the earth.
Solution
To use the formula 
, we need to know r and :
Radius of earth plus height 
of satellite
,
.
Now, using 
, we have
.
Thus the linear speed of the satellite is approximately 531 
.

Angular Speed of a Capstan.

Solution
We will use the formula 
in the form 
, taking
care to use the proper units. Since v is given in feet per second, we need 
r in feet:
.
Then 
will be in radians per second:
.
Thus the angular speed is approximately 0.741 
.
The formulas 
and 
can be used in combination to 
find distances and angles in various situations involving rotational 
motion.
EXAMPLE 11
Angle of Revolution.
A 2004 Tundra V8 is traveling at 
a speed of 65 mph. Its tires have an outside diameter of 30.56 in. Find 
the angle through which a tire turns in 10 sec.
Solution
Recall that 
, or 
. Thus we can find 
if we know
and t. To find , we use the formula 
. The linear speed v of a
point on the outside of the tire is the speed of the Tundra, 65 mph. For
convenience, we first convert 65 mph to feet per second:
.
The radius of the tire is half the diameter. Now 
15.28 in. We will convert to feet, since v is in feet per second:

The Trigonometric Functions
Copyright © 2006 Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Addison-Wesley

Given the coordinates of a point on the unit circle, find its reflections
across the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin.
Determine the six trigonometric function values for a real number when
the coordinates of the point on the unit circle determined by that real
number are given.
Find function values for any real number using a calculator.
Graph the six circular functions and state their properties.
The domains of the trigonometric functions, defined in Sections 5.1 and
5.3, have been sets of angles or rotations measured in a real number of
degree units. We can also consider the domains to be sets of real num-
bers, or radians, introduced in Section 5.4. Many applications in calculus
that use the trigonometric functions refer only to radians.
Let’s again consider radian measure and the unit circle. We defined
radian measure for 
as
.
When 
,
,
or
.
The arc length s on the unit circle is the same as the radian measure of
the angle .
In the figure above, the point 
is the point where the terminal
side of the angle with radian measure s intersects the unit circle. We can
now extend our definitions of the trigonometric functions using do-
mains composed of real numbers, or radians.
In the definitions, s can be considered the radian measure of an angle 
or the measure of an arc length on the unit circle. Either way, s is a real num-
ber. To each real number s, there corresponds an arc length s on the unit 
circle. Trigonometric functions with domains composed of real numbers 
are called circular functions.

Basic Circular Functions
For a real number s that determines a point 
on the unit circle:

We can consider the domains of trigonometric functions to be real
numbers rather than angles. We can determine these values for a specific
real number if we know the coordinates of the point on the unit circle 
determined by that number. As with degree measure, we can also find
these function values directly using a calculator.
Reflections on the Unit Circle
Let’s consider the unit circle and a few of its points. For any point 
on
the unit circle,
, we know that 
and 
.
If we know the x- or y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle, we can find
the other coordinate. If
, then
.
Thus,
and 
are points on the unit circle. There are two 
points with an x-coordinate of .
Now let’s consider the radian measure 
and determine the coordi-
nates of the point on the unit circle determined by 
. We construct a right
triangle by dropping a perpendicular segment from the point to the 
x-axis.

Since 
, we have a 30–60 right triangle in which the side
opposite the 30 angle is one half of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse,
or radius, is 1, so the side opposite the 30 angle is 
, or . Using the
Pythagorean theorem, we can find the other side:
.
We know that y is positive since the point is in the first quadrant.
Thus the coordinates of the point determined by 
are 
and
, or 
. We can always check to see if a point is on 
the unit circle by substituting into the equation 
:
.
Because a unit circle is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the 
y-axis, and the origin, we can use the coordinates of one point on the 
unit circle to find coordinates of its reflections.

Using a calculator, we can find trigonometric function values of any
real number without knowing the coordinates of the point that it deter-
mines on the unit circle. Most calculators have both degree and radian
modes. When finding function values of radian measures, or real num-
bers, we must set the calculator in RADIAN mode. (See the window at left.)

Find each of the following function values of radian mea-
sures using a calculator. Round the answers to four decimal places.

Solution
Using a calculator set in RADIAN mode, we find the values.

Note in part (d) that the secant function value can be found by tak-
ing the reciprocal of the cosine value. Thus we can enter

the reciprocal key.

EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
We can graph the unit circle using a
graphing calculator. We use PARAMETRIC mode with the following window
and let X1T
cos T and Y1T
sin T. Here we use DEGREE mode.
WINDOW
Using the trace key and an arrow key to move the cursor around the unit 
circle, we see the T, X, and Y values appear on the screen. What do they rep-
resent? Repeat this exercise in RADIAN mode. What do the T, X, and Y values
represent? (For more on parametric equations, see Section 9.7.)
From the definitions on p. 488, we can relabel any point 
on the
unit circle as 
, where s is any real number.
Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions
Properties of functions can be observed from their graphs. We begin by
graphing the sine and cosine functions. We make a table of values, plot 
the points, and then connect those points with a smooth curve. It is 
helpful to first draw a unit circle and label a few points with coordinates.
We can either use the coordinates as the function values or find approxi-
mate sine and cosine values directly with a calculator.

The Trigonometric Functions
The sine and cosine functions are continuous functions. Note in the
graph of the sine function that function values increase from 0 at 
to 1 at 
, then decrease to 0 at 
, decrease further to 1 at
, and increase to 0 at 
. The reverse pattern follows when s
decreases from 0 to 
. Note in the graph of the cosine function that 
function values start at 1 when 
, and decrease to 0 at 
. They
decrease further to 1 at 
, then increase to 0 at 
, and 
increase further to 1 at 
. An identical pattern follows when s de-
creases from 0 to 
.
From the unit circle and the graphs of the functions, we know that 
the domain of both the sine and cosine functions is the entire set of real
numbers,
. The range of each function is the set of all real num-
bers from 1 to 1,
.
Domain and Range of Sine and Cosine Functions
The domain of the sine and cosine functions is 
.
The range of the sine and cosine functions is 
.
EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Another way to construct the sine and
cosine graphs is by considering the unit circle and transferring vertical dis-
tances for the sine function and horizontal distances for the cosine function.
Using a graphing calculator, we can visualize the transfer of these distances.
We use the calculator set in PARAMETRIC and RADIAN modes and let
X1T
and Y1T
for the unit circle centered at 
and
X2T
and Y2T
for the sine curve. Use the following window 
settings.
With the calculator set in SIMULTANEOUS mode, we can actually watch the
sine function (in red) “unwind” from the unit circle (in blue). In the two
screens at left, we partially illustrate this animated procedure.
Consult your calculator’s instruction manual for specific keystrokes and
graph both the sine curve and the cosine curve in this manner. (For more on
parametric equations, see Section 9.7.)
A function with a repeating pattern is called periodic. The sine 
and cosine functions are examples of periodic functions. The values of
these functions repeat themselves every 
units. In other words, for 
any s, we have

To see this another way, think of the part of the graph between 0 and 
and note that the rest of the graph consists of copies of it. If we trans-
late the graph of
or 
to the left or right 
units, we
will obtain the original graph. We say that each of these functions has a
period of

Periodic Function
A function f is said to be periodic if there exists a positive constant p
such that
for all s in the domain of f. The smallest such positive number p is
called the period of the function.
The period p can be thought of as the length of the shortest recurring
interval.
We can also use the unit circle to verify that the period of the sine 
and cosine functions is 
. Consider any real number s and the point T
that it determines on a unit circle, as shown at left. If we increase s by 
, the point determined by 
is again the point T. Hence for any
real number s,
and

It is also true that

, and so on.
In fact, for any integer k, the following equations are identities:
and

or

.
The amplitude of a periodic function is defined as one half of the
distance between its maximum and minimum function values. It is al-
ways positive. Both the graphs and the unit circle verify that the maxi-
mum value of the sine and cosine functions is 1, whereas the minimum
value of each is 1. Thus,

Thus we have shown that the sine function is odd and the cosine func-
tion is even.

Graphs of the Tangent, Cotangent,
Cosecant, and Secant Functions
To graph the tangent function, we could make a table of values using a
calculator, but in this case it is easier to begin with the definition of tan-
gent and the coordinates of a few points on the unit circle. We recall that

The tangent function is not defined when x, the first coordinate, is 0.
That is, it is not defined for any number s whose cosine is 0:

We draw vertical asymptotes at these locations (see Fig. 1 below).

We can add these ordered pairs to the graph (see Fig. 2 above) and inves-
tigate the values in 
using a calculator. Note that the func-
tion value is 0 when 
, and the values increase without bound as s
increases toward 
. The graph gets closer and closer to an asymptote as
s gets closer to 
, but it never touches the line. As s decreases from 0 to
, the values decrease without bound. Again the graph gets closer 
and closer to an asymptote, but it never touches it. We now complete 
the graph.

From the graph, we see that the tangent function is continuous 
except where it is not defined. The period of the tangent function is .
Note that although there is a period, there is no amplitude because there
are no maximum and minimum values. When 
,
is not de-
fined 
. Thus the domain of the tangent function is 
the set of all real numbers except 
, where k is an integer. The
range of the function is the set of all real numbers.
The cotangent function 
is not defined when y,
the second coordinate, is 0—that is, it is not defined for any number s
whose sine is 0. Thus the cotangent is not defined for 
,
,
,
. The graph of the function is shown below.
The cosecant and sine functions are reciprocal functions, as are the
secant and cosine functions. The graphs of the cosecant and secant func-
tions can be constructed by finding the reciprocals of the values of the
sine and cosine functions, respectively. Thus the functions will be posi-
tive together and negative together. The cosecant function is not defined
for those numbers s whose sine is 0. The secant function is not defined 
for those numbers s whose cosine is 0. In the graphs below, the sine and
cosine functions are shown by the gray curves for reference.

In this chapter, we have used the letter s for arc length and have
avoided the letters x and y, which generally represent first and second 
coordinates. Nevertheless, we can represent the arc length on a unit circle
by any variable, such as s, t, x, or . Each arc length determines a point
that can be labeled with an ordered pair. The first coordinate of that 
ordered pair is the cosine of the arc length, and the second coordinate is
the sine of the arc length. The identities we have developed hold no mat-
ter what symbols are used for variables—for example,
,
,
, and 
.

Pythagorean Identities
We now consider three other identities that are fundamental to a study of
trigonometry. They are called the Pythagorean identities. Recall that the
equation of a unit circle in the xy-plane is
.
For any point on the unit circle, the coordinates x and y satisfy this equa-
tion. Suppose that a real number s determines a point on the unit circle
with coordinates 
, or 
. Then 
and 
.
Substituting 
for x and 
for y in the equation of the unit circle
gives us the identity
,
Substituting cos s for x
and sin s for y

The identity 
gives a relationship between the 
sine and the cosine of any real number s. It is an important Pythagorean
identity.
EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Addition of y-values provides a unique
way of developing the identity 
First, graph 
and 
By visually adding the y-values, sketch the graph of the
sum,
Then graph 
using a graphing calculator and
check your sketch. The resulting graph appears to be the line 
which

Trigonometric Identities, Inverse Functions, and Equations
We can divide by 
on both sides of the preceding identity:
.
Dividing by 
Simplifying gives us a second identity:
.
This equation is true for any replacement of s with a real number for
which 
, since we divided by 
. But the numbers for which
(or 
) are exactly the ones for which the cotangent 
and cosecant functions are not defined. Hence our new equation holds
for all real numbers s for which 
and 
are defined and is thus 
an identity.
The third Pythagorean identity can be obtained by dividing by 
on
both sides of the first Pythagorean identity:
Dividing by 
.
Simplifying
The identities we have developed hold no matter what symbols are
used for the variables. For example, we could write

pressions, but it is often helpful to write everything in terms of sines and
cosines, as we did in Example 1. We also look for the Pythagorean iden-
tity,
, within a trigonometric expression.
EXAMPLE 2
Factor and simplify:
.
Solution
Removing a common factor
Using 
A graphing calculator can be used to perform a partial check of an iden-
tity. First, we graph the expression on the left side of the equals sign. Then
we graph the expression on the right side using the same screen. If the two
graphs are indistinguishable, then we have a partial verification that the
equation is an identity. Of course, we can never see the entire graph, so there
can always be some doubt. Also, the graphs may not overlap precisely, but
you may not be able to tell because the difference between the graphs may be
less than the width of a pixel. However, if the graphs are obviously different,
we know that a mistake has been made.
Consider the identity in Example 1:
.
Recalling that 
, we enter
and
.
To graph, we first select SEQUENTIAL mode. Then we select the “line”-graph
style for 
and the “path”-graph style, denoted by 
, for 
. The calcula-
tor will graph 
first. Then as it graphs 
, the circular cursor will trace the
leading edge of the graph, allowing us to determine whether the graphs 
coincide. As you can see in the first screen on the left, the graphs appear 
to be identical. Thus,
is most likely an
identity.
The TABLE feature can also be used to check identities. Note in the table
at left that the function values are the same except for those values of x for
which

identity is an equation that is true for all possible replacements.
Suppose that we had simplified incorrectly in Example 1 and had gotten

When radicals occur, the use of absolute value is sometimes neces-
sary, but it can be difficult to determine when to use it. In Examples 5 
and 6, we will assume that all radicands are nonnegative. This means that
the identities are meant to be confined to certain quadrants.

show in the following example.

Sum and Difference Identities
We now develop some important identities involving sums or differ-
ences of two numbers (or angles), beginning with an identity for the 
cosine of the difference of two numbers. We use the letters u and v for
these numbers.
Let’s consider a real number u in the interval 
and a real
number v in the interval 
. These determine points A and B on 
the unit circle, as shown below. The arc length s is 
, and we know
that 
. Recall that the coordinates of A are 
, and 
the coordinates of B are

Now let’s imagine rotating the circle on page 536 so that point B is 
at 
as shown at left. Although the coordinates of point A are now
, the distance AB has not changed.
Again we use the distance formula to write an expression for the dis-
tance AB:
.
This can be simplified as follows:
.
Equating our two expressions for AB, we obtain
.
Solving this equation for cos s gives
.
(1)
But 
, so we have the equation
.
(2)
Formula (1) above holds when s is the length of the shortest arc from
A to B. Given any real numbers u and v, the length of the shortest arc 
from A to B is not always 
. In fact, it could be 
. However,
since 
, we know that 
. Thus,
is always equal to 
. Formula (2) holds for all real num-
bers u and v. That formula is thus the identity we sought:
.
Using a graphing calculator, we can graph
and
to illustrate this result.
The cosine sum formula follows easily from the one we have just 
derived. Let’s consider

Trigonometric Identities, Inverse Functions, and Equations
6.2
Identities:
Cofunction,
Double-Angle,
and Half-Angle
Use cofunction identities to derive other identities.
Use the double-angle identities to find function values of twice an 
angle when one function value is known for that angle.
Use the half-angle identities to find function values of half an 
angle when one function value is known for that angle.
Simplify trigonometric expressions using the double-angle and 
half-angle identities.
Cofunction Identities
Each of the identities listed below yields a conversion to a cofunction. For
this reason, we call them cofunction identities.
Cofunction Identities
,
,
,
,
,
We verified the first two of these identities in Section 6.1. The other
four can be proved using the first two and the definitions of the trigono-
metric functions. These identities hold for all real numbers, and thus, for
all angle measures, but if we restrict 
to values such that 
,
or 
, then we have a special application to the acute angles of
a right triangle.
Comparing graphs can lead to possible identities. On the left below,
we see that the graph of

of

units. On the right, we see the graph of

Double-Angle Identities
If we double an angle of measure x, the new angle will have measure 2x.
Double-angle identities give trigonometric function values of 2x in
terms of function values of x. To develop these identities, we will use the
sum formulas from the preceding section. We first develop a formula for
. Recall that
.
We will consider a number x and substitute it for both u and v in this
identity. Doing so gives us
.
Our first double-angle identity is thus
.
We can graph
,
and
using the “line”-graph style for 
and the “path”-graph style for 
and see
that they appear to have the same graph. We can also use the TABLE feature.
Double-angle identities for the cosine and tangent functions can be
derived in much the same way as the identity above:

If we take half of an angle of measure x, the new angle will have measure

60. Nautical Mile.
Latitude is used to measure
north–south location on the earth between the
equator and the poles. For example, Chicago has
latitude 42N. (See the figure.) In Great Britain, the
nautical mile is defined as the length of a minute of
arc of the earth’s radius. Since the earth is flattened
slightly at the poles, a British nautical mile varies
with latitude. In fact, it is given, in feet, by the
function
,
where 
is the latitude in degrees.

61. Acceleration Due to Gravity.
The acceleration due
to gravity is often denoted by g in a formula such as
, where S is the distance that an object falls
in time t. The number g relates to motion near the
earth’s surface and is usually considered constant.
In fact, however, g is not constant, but varies slightly
with latitude. If
stands for latitude, in degrees, g is
given with good approximation by the formula
,
where g is measured in meters per second per second

Proving
Trigonometric
Identities
Prove identities using other identities.
The Logic of Proving Identities
We outline two algebraic methods for proving identities.
Method 1. Start with either the left or the right side of the equation and 
obtain the other side. For example, suppose you are trying to prove that 
the equation 
is an identity. You might try to produce a string of
statements 
like the following, which start with 
P and end with Q or start with Q and end with P:
or






.
Method 2. Work with each side separately until you obtain the same 
expression. For example, suppose you are trying to prove that 
is 
an identity. You might be able to produce two strings of statements like
the following, each ending with the same statement S.

Trigonometric Identities, Inverse Functions, and Equations
Study Tip
Forming a small study group 
(not more than three or four
students) can be helpful when
learning to prove identities. Your
skills with this topic can be greatly
improved in group discussions.
Retention of the skills can be
maximized when you explain the
material to someone else.
The number of steps in each string might be different, but in each case 
the result is S.
A first step in learning to prove identities is to have at hand a list of
the identities that you have already learned. Such a list is in the back end-
papers of this text. Ask your instructor which ones you are expected to
memorize. The more identities you prove, the easier it will be to prove
new ones. A list of helpful hints follows.
Hints for Proving Identities
1. Use method 1 or 2 above.
2. Work with the more complex side first.
3. Carry out any algebraic manipulations, such as adding,
subtracting, multiplying, or factoring.
4. Multiplying by 1 can be helpful when rational expressions 
are involved.
5. Converting all expressions to sines and cosines is often helpful.
6. Try something! Put your pencil to work and get involved. You will
be amazed at how often this leads to success.
Proving Identities
In what follows, method 1 is used in Examples 1–3 and method 2 is used
in Examples 4 and 5.
EXAMPLE 1
Prove the identity 
.
Solution
Let’s use method 1. We begin with the right side and obtain the
left side:
Squaring
Recalling the identity 
and
substituting
.

We could also begin with the left side and obtain the right side:

EXAMPLE 2
Prove the identity
.
Solution
We use method 1, starting with the left side. Note that the left
side involves 
, whereas the right side involves 
, so it might be 
wise to make use of a basic identity that involves these two expressions:
.
Substituting 
for sec t
Multiplying
We started with the left side and obtained the right side, so the proof is
complete.

EXAMPLE 4
Prove the identity
.
Solution
For this proof, we are going to work with each side separately
using method 2. We try to obtain the same expression on each side. In 
actual practice, you might work on one side for a while, then work on the
other side, and then go back to the first side. In other words, you work
back and forth until you arrive at the same expression. Let’s start with 
the right side:
Factoring
.
At this point, we stop and work with the left side,
, of the 
original identity and try to end with the same expression that we ended
with on the right side:
.
We have obtained the same expression from each side, so the proof is
complete.

.
Simplify expressions involving compositions such as 
without using a calculator.
Simplify expressions such as 
by making a drawing and
reading off appropriate ratios.
In this section, we develop inverse trigonometric functions. The graphs 
of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions follow. Do these functions have
inverses that are functions? They do have inverses if they are one-to-one,
which means that they pass the horizontal-line test.

Note that for each function, a horizontal line (shown in red) crosses
the graph more than once. Therefore, none of them has an inverse that is
a function.
The graphs of an equation and its inverse are reflections of each 
other across the line 
. Let’s examine the graphs of the inverses of
each of the three functions graphed above.
We can check again to see whether these are graphs of functions by
using the vertical-line test. In each case, there is a vertical line (shown in
red) that crosses the graph more than once, so each fails to be a function.

Restricting Ranges to Define Inverse Functions
Recall that a function like 
does not have an inverse that is a
function, but by restricting the domain of f to nonnegative numbers, we
have a new squaring function,
,
, that has an inverse,
. This is equivalent to restricting the range of the inverse re-
lation to exclude ordered pairs that contain negative numbers.
In a similar manner, we can define new trigonometric functions
whose inverses are functions. We can do this by restricting either the do-
mains of the basic trigonometric functions or the ranges of their inverse
relations. This can be done in many ways, but the restrictions illustrated
below with solid red curves are fairly standard in mathematics.

For the inverse sine function, we choose a range close to the origin
that allows all inputs on the interval 
to have function values.
Thus we choose the interval 
for the range (Fig. 1). For the
inverse cosine function, we choose a range close to the origin that allows
all inputs on the interval 
to have function values. We choose the
interval 
(Fig. 2). For the inverse tangent function, we choose a
range close to the origin that allows all real numbers to have function 
values. The interval 
satisfies this requirement (Fig. 3).

and the range of each inverse.
The following diagrams show the restricted ranges for the inverse
trigonometric functions on a unit circle. Compare these graphs with the
graphs above. The ranges of these functions should be memorized. The
missing endpoints in the graph of the arctangent function indicate inputs
that are not in the domain of the original function.

Various compositions of trigonometric functions and their inverses often
occur in practice. For example, we might want to try to simplify an ex-
pression such as

In the expression on the left, we are finding “the sine of a number whose
sine is x.” Recall from Section 4.1 that if a function f has an inverse that 
is also a function, then

Thus, if

Now let’s consider an expression like

suspect that this is equal to x for any x in the domain of

is not true unless x is in the range of the

order to define

In doing so, we restricted the range of the inverse sine function. Thus,

triangle is an angle whose sine is . We wish to find the cosine of this
angle. Since the triangle is a right triangle, we can find the length of the
base, b. It is 4. Thus we know that 
, or . Therefore,
.
EXAMPLE 6
Find 
.
Solution
We draw a right triangle whose legs have lengths x and 2, so
that 
. Since the range of
is 
, we
consider only positive values of x.
We find the length of the hypotenuse and then read off the sine ratio.
We get
.
In the following example, we use a sum identity to evaluate an 
expression.
EXAMPLE 7
Evaluate:
.
Solution
Since 
and 
are both angles, the expression is the
sine of a sum of two angles, so we use the identity

Equations
Solve trigonometric equations.
When an equation contains a trigonometric expression with a variable,
such as 
, it is called a trigonometric equation. Some trigonometric
equations are identities, such as 
. Now we consider
equations, such as 
, that are usually not identities. As we 
have done for other types of equations, we will solve such equations by
finding all values for x that make the equation true.

Solution
We first solve for cos x:

The solutions are numbers that have a cosine of

the unit circle (see Section 5.5).
There are just two points on the unit circle for which the cosine is 
,
as shown in the figure at left. They are the points corresponding to 
and
. These numbers, plus any multiple of

and

,
where k is any integer.
To check the solution to 
, we can graph 
and
on the same set of axes and find the first coordinates of the points
of intersection. Using 
as the Xscl facilitates our reading of the solutions.
First, let’s graph these equations on the interval from 0 to 
, as shown in
the figure on the left below. The only solutions in 
are 
and
Next, let’s change the viewing window to 
and graph
again. Since the cosine function is periodic, there is an infinite number of so-
lutions. A few of these appear in the graph on the right above. From the
graph, we see that the solutions are 
and 
, where k
is any integer.

We first solve for tan 2x:

Using the unit circle, we find points 2x in

Thus the desired values of x in

Zero Method. We write the equation in the form
.
Then we graph
and use the ZERO feature to determine the zeros of the function.
The leftmost zero is 60. Using the ZERO feature two more times, we
find the other zeros, 180 and 300. The solutions in 
are 60,
180, and 300.

If a trigonometric equation is quadratic but difficult or impossible to
factor, we use the quadratic formula.
EXAMPLE 7
Solve 
in 
.
Solution
This equation is quadratic in 
with 
,
, and
. Substituting into the quadratic formula, we get
Substituting
.
Since sine values are never greater than 1, the first of the equations has 
no solution. Using the other equation, we find the reference angle to be
25.44. Since 
is negative, the solutions are in quadrants III and IV.
Thus the solutions in 
are
and
.
Trigonometric equations can involve more than one function.
EXAMPLE 8
Solve 
in 
.
Solution
Using a graphing calculator, we can determine that there are six
solutions. If we let 
, the solutions are read more easily. In the fig-
ures at left, we show the Intersect and Zero methods of solving graphically.
Each illustrates that the solutions in 
are
0,
and
We can verify these solutions algebraically, as follows:

When a trigonometric equation involves more than one function, it 
is sometimes helpful to use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of
a single function.

Algebraic Solution
We have
Squaring both sides
Using 
.
Using 
We are looking for solutions x to the equation for which
. Multiplying by 2, we get 
, which is
the interval we consider to solve 
. These values of 2x
are 0,
,
, and 
. Thus the desired values of x in 
satisfying this equation are 0,
,
, and 
. Now we
check these in the original equation 
:
,
,
,
.
We find that 
and 
do not check, but the other values
do. Thus the solutions in 
are
0
and
.
When the solution process involves squaring both sides, val-
ues are sometimes obtained that are not solutions of the original
equation. As we saw in this example, it is important to check the
possible solutions.

Graphical Solution
We can graph the left side and then the
right side of the equation as seen 
in the first window below. Then we 
look for points of intersection. We 
could also rewrite the equation as
, graph the left
side, and look for the zeros of the func-
tion, as illustrated in the second window
below. In each window, we see the solu-
tions in 
as 0 and 
.
This example illustrates a valuable
advantage of the calculator—that is, with
a graphing calculator, extraneous solu-
tions do not appear.

69. Nautical Mile.
(See Exercise 60 in Exercise Set 6.2.)
In Great Britain, the nautical mile is defined as the
length of a minute of arc of the earth’s radius. Since
the earth is flattened at the poles, a British nautical
mile varies with latitude. In fact, it is given, in feet,
by the function
,
where 
is the latitude in degrees. At what latitude
north is the length of a British nautical mile found
to be 6040 ft?

70. Acceleration Due to Gravity.
(See Exercise 61 in
Exercise Set 6.2.) The acceleration due to gravity is
often denoted by g in a formula such as 
,
where S is the distance that an object falls in 
t seconds. The number g is generally considered
constant, but in fact it varies slightly with latitude.
If
stands for latitude, in degrees, an excellent
approximation of g is given by the formula
,
where g is measured in meters per second per second
at sea level. At what latitude north does

Applications of Trigonometry
7.1
The Law of Sines
Use the law of sines to solve triangles.
Find the area of any triangle given the lengths of two sides and the
measure of the included angle.
To solve a triangle means to find the lengths of all its sides and the 
measures of all its angles. We solved right triangles in Section 5.2. For 
review, let’s solve the right triangle shown below. We begin by listing the
known measures.
Since the sum of the three angle measures of any triangle is 180, we
can immediately find the measure of the third angle:
.
Then using the tangent and cosine ratios, respectively, we can find q
and w:
,
or
,
and
,
or
.
Now all six measures are known and we have solved triangle QWZ.
Solving Oblique Triangles
The trigonometric functions can also be used to solve triangles that are
not right triangles. Such triangles are called oblique. Any triangle, right
or oblique, can be solved if at least one side and any other two measures 
are known. The five possible situations are illustrated on the next page.

1. AAS: Two angles of a triangle 
and a side opposite one of them 
are known.
2. ASA: Two angles of a triangle 
and the included side are 
known.
3. SSA: Two sides of a triangle 
and an angle opposite one of
them are known. (In this case,
there may be no solution, one 
solution, or two solutions. The 
latter is known as the 
ambiguous case.)
4. SAS: Two sides of a triangle 
and the included angle are 
known.
5. SSS: All three sides of the 
triangle are known.
The list above does not include the situation in which only the three
angle measures are given. The reason for this lies in the fact that the 
angle measures determine only the shape of the triangle and not the size,
as shown with the following triangles. Thus we cannot solve a triangle
when only the three angle measures are given.

In order to solve oblique triangles, we need to derive the law of sines
and the law of cosines. The law of sines applies to the first three situa-
tions listed above. The law of cosines, which we develop in Section 7.2,
applies to the last two situations.
The Law of Sines
We consider any oblique triangle. It may or may not have an obtuse 
angle. Although we look at only the acute-triangle case, the derivation of
the obtuse-triangle case is essentially the same.
In acute 
at left, we have drawn an altitude from vertex C. It 
has length h. From 
, we have
,
or
.
From 
, we have
,
or
.
With 
and 
, we now have
Dividing by sin A sin B
.
Simplifying
There is no danger of dividing by 0 here because we are dealing with tri-
angles whose angles are never 0 or 180. Thus the sine value will never 
be 0.
If we were to consider altitudes from vertex A and vertex B in the tri-
angle shown above, the same argument would give us
and
.
We combine these results to obtain the law of sines.
The Law of Sines
In any triangle ABC,
.
Thus in any triangle, the sides are
proportional to the sines of the 
opposite angles.

Solving Triangles (AAS and ASA)
When two angles and a side of any triangle are known, the law of sines 
can be used to solve the triangle.
EXAMPLE 1
In 
,
,
, and 
. Solve the 
triangle.
Solution
We first make a drawing. We know three of the six measures.
From the figure, we see that we have the AAS situation. We begin by 
finding F:
.
We can now find the other two sides, using the law of sines:
Substituting
Solving for f

Substituting

Thus, we have solved the triangle:

EXAMPLE 2
Rescue Mission.
During a rescue mission, a Marine fighter
pilot receives data on an unidentified aircraft from an AWACS plane and 
is instructed to intercept the aircraft. The diagram shown below appears 
on the screen, but before the distance to the point of interception appears 
on the screen, communications are jammed. Fortunately, the pilot re-
members the law of sines. How far must the pilot fly?
Solution
We let x represent the distance that the pilot must fly in order
to intercept the aircraft and Z represent the point of interception. We 
first find angle Z:
.
Because this application involves the ASA situation, we use the law of
sines to determine x:
Substituting
Solving for x
.
Thus the pilot must fly approximately 736 km in order to intercept the
unidentified aircraft.
Solving Triangles (SSA)
When two sides of a triangle and an angle opposite one of them are
known, the law of sines can be used to solve the triangle.
Suppose for 
that b, c, and B are given. The various possibili-
ties are as shown in the eight cases below: five cases when B is acute and 
three cases when B is obtuse. Note that 
in cases 1, 2, 3, and 6;

Examples 3–5 illustrate the SSA situation. Note that we need not
memorize the eight cases or the procedures in finding no solution, one 
solution, or two solutions. When we are using the law of sines, the sine
value leads us directly to the correct solution or solutions.
The Area of a Triangle
The familiar formula for the area of a triangle,

only when h is known. However, we can use the method used to derive 
the law of sines to derive an area formula that does not involve the height.

Area of the Peace Monument.
Through the Mentoring in
the City Program sponsored by Marian College, in Indianapolis, Indiana,
children have turned a vacant downtown lot into a monument for 
peace.* This community project brought together neighborhood volun-
teers, businesses, and government in hopes of showing children how to
develop positive, nonviolent ways of dealing with conflict. A landscape 
architect† used the children’s drawings and ideas to design a triangular-
shaped peace garden. Two sides of the property, formed by Indiana 
Avenue and Senate Avenue, measure 182 ft and 230 ft, respectively, and 
together form a 44.7 angle. The third side of the garden, formed by an
apartment building, measures 163 ft. What is the area of this property?
Solution
Since we do not know a height of the triangle, we use the area
formula:

Use the law of cosines to solve triangles.
Determine whether the law of sines or the law of cosines should be
applied to solve a triangle.
The law of sines is used to solve triangles given a side and two angles 
(AAS and ASA) or given two sides and an angle opposite one of them
(SSA). A second law, called the law of cosines, is needed to solve triangles
given two sides and the included angle (SAS) or given three sides (SSS).
The Law of Cosines
To derive this property, we consider any 
placed on a coordinate
system. We position the origin at one of the vertices—say, C—and the
positive half of the x-axis along one of the sides—say, CB. Let 
be 
the coordinates of vertex A. Point B has coordinates 
and point C
has coordinates 
.
Then
,
so
and
,
so
.
Thus point A has coordinates
.
Next, we use the distance formula to determine 
:
,
or
.
Now we multiply and simplify:

Had we placed the origin at one of the other vertices, we would have 
obtained
or
.
The Law of Cosines
In any triangle ABC,
,
,
or
.
Thus, in any triangle, the square of a side is the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides, minus twice the product of those sides and the
cosine of the included angle. When the included angle is 90, the law
of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean theorem.
Solving Triangles (SAS)
When two sides of a triangle and the included angle are known, we can
use the law of cosines to find the third side. The law of cosines or the law
of sines can then be used to finish solving the triangle.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve 
if
,
, and 
.
Solution
We first label a triangle with the known and unknown 
measures.
We can find the third side using the law of cosines, as follows:
Substituting
.
We now have 
,
, and 
, and we need to find the
other two angle measures. At this point, we can find them in two ways.
One way uses the law of sines. The ambiguous case may arise, however,
and we would have to be alert to this possibility. The advantage of using

the law of cosines again is that if we solve for the cosine and find that 
its value is negative, then we know that the angle is obtuse. If the value 
of the cosine is positive, then the angle is acute. Thus we use the law of
cosines to find a second angle.
Let’s find angle A. We select the formula from the law of cosines that
contains 
and substitute:
Substituting
.
The third angle is now easy to find:
.
Thus,
,
,
,
,
,
.
Due to errors created by rounding, answers may vary depending on
the order in which they are found. Had we found the measure of angle C
first in Example 1, the angle measures would have been 
and
. Variances in rounding also change the answers. Had we used
71.4 for b in Example 1, the angle measures would have been 
and 
.
Suppose we used the law of sines at the outset in Example 1 to find b.
We were given only three measures:
,
, and 
.
When substituting these measures into the proportions, we see that there
is not enough information to use the law of sines:
,
,
.
In all three situations, the resulting equation, after the substitutions, still
has two unknowns. Thus we cannot use the law of sines to find b.

Solving Triangles (SSS)
When all three sides of a triangle are known, the law of cosines can be
used to solve the triangle.
EXAMPLE 2
Solve 
if
,
, and

Solution
We sketch a triangle and label it with the given measures.
Since we do not know any of the angle measures, we cannot use the law 
of sines. We begin instead by finding an angle with the law of cosines. We
choose to find S first and select the formula that contains 
:

Similarly, we find angle R:

EXAMPLE 3
Knife Bevel.
Knifemakers know that the bevel of the blade
(the angle formed at the cutting edge of the blade) determines the cut-
ting characteristics of the knife. A small bevel like that of a straight razor
makes for a keen edge, but is impractical for heavy-duty cutting because
the edge dulls quickly and is prone to chipping. A large bevel is suitable
for heavy-duty work like chopping wood. Survival knives, being univer-
sal in application, are a compromise between small and large bevels. The
diagram at left illustrates the blade of a hand-made Randall Model 18 sur-
vival knife. What is its bevel? (Source: Randall Made Knives, P.O.
Box 1988, Orlando, FL 32802)
Solution
We know three sides of a triangle. We can use the law of
cosines to find the bevel, angle A.
.
Thus the bevel is approximately 14.36.

25. Poachers.
A park ranger establishes an observation
post from which to watch for poachers. Despite
losing her map, the ranger does have a compass and
a rangefinder. She observes some poachers, and the
rangefinder indicates that they are 500 ft from her
position. They are headed toward big game that she
knows to be 375 ft from her position. Using her
compass, she finds that the poachers’ azimuth (the
direction measured as an angle from north) is 355
and that of the big game is 42. What is the distance
between the poachers and the game?
About 367 ft

A circus highwire act walks up
an approach wire to reach a highwire. The approach
wire is 122 ft long and is currently anchored so that
it forms the maximum allowable angle of 35 with
the ground. A greater approach angle causes the
aerialists to slip. However, the aerialists find that
there is enough room to anchor the approach wire
30 ft back in order to make the approach angle less
severe. When this is done, how much farther will
they have to walk up the approach wire, and what
will the new approach angle be?

Graph complex numbers.
Given a complex number in standard form, find trigonometric, or polar,
notation; and given a complex number in trigonometric form, find
standard notation.
Use trigonometric notation to multiply and divide complex numbers.
Use DeMoivre’s theorem to raise complex numbers to powers.
Find the nth roots of a complex number.
Graphical Representation
Just as real numbers can be graphed on a line, complex numbers can be
graphed on a plane. We graph a complex number 
in the same way
that we graph an ordered pair of real numbers 
. However, in place of
an x-axis, we have a real axis, and in place of a y-axis, we have an imagi-
nary axis. Horizontal distances correspond to the real part of a number.
Vertical distances correspond to the imaginary part.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph each of the following complex numbers.
a)
b)
c) 3i
d)
e) 2
Solution
We recall that the absolute value of a real number is its distance from
0 on the number line. The absolute value of a complex number is its dis-
tance from the origin in the complex plane. For example, if
,
then using the distance formula, we have

Trigonometric Notation for Complex Numbers
Now let’s consider a nonzero complex number 
. Suppose that its
absolute value is r. If we let 
be an angle in standard position whose ter-
minal side passes through the point 
, as shown in the figure, then
,
or
and
,
or
.
Substituting these values for a and b into the 
notation, we get
.
This is trigonometric notation for a complex number 
. The 
number r is called the absolute value of
, and 
is called the 
argument of
. Trigonometric notation for a complex number is
also called polar notation.
Trigonometric Notation for Complex Numbers

dard notation,

named for the French mathematician Abraham DeMoivre (1667–1754).
Let’s consider the square of a complex number

Roots of Complex Numbers
As we will see, every nonzero complex number has two square roots. A
nonzero complex number has three cube roots, four fourth roots, and so
on. In general, a nonzero complex number has n different nth roots. They
can be found using the formula that we now state but do not prove.

We first find trigonometric notation:
.
Then 
,
, and 
, 1; and
,
, 1
,
, 1.
Thus the roots are
for

for 
,
or
and
.
In Example 10, we see that the two square roots of the number are 
opposites of each other. We can illustrate this graphically. We also note
that the roots are equally spaced about a circle of radius r—in this case,
. The roots are 
, or 180 apart.
EXAMPLE 11
Find the cube roots of 1. Then locate them on a graph.
Solution
We begin by finding trigonometric notation:
.
Then 
,
, and 
, 1, 2; and
,
, 1, 2.
The roots are
,
,
and
,
or
1,
,
and
.
The graphs of the cube roots lie equally spaced about a circle of
radius 1. The roots are 
, or 120 apart.
The nth roots of 1 are often referred to as the nth roots of unity. In
Example 11, we found the cube roots of unity.

EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Using a graphing calculator set in 
PARAMETRIC mode, we can approximate the nth roots of a number p. We use
the following window and let
X1T

and
Y1T

.
WINDOW
, if in degree mode, or
, if in radian mode
, or 
,
,
,
,
To find the fifth roots of 8, enter X1T

and 
Y1T

. In this case, use DEGREE mode. After the graph has
been generated, use the TRACE feature to locate the fifth roots. The T, X, and
Y values appear on the screen. What do they represent?
Three of the fifth roots of 8 are approximately
1.5157,
,
and
.
Find the other two. Then use a calculator to approximate the cube roots of
unity that were found in Example 11. Also approximate the fourth roots of
5 and the tenth roots of unity.

Polar Coordinates
and Graphs
Graph points given their polar coordinates.
Convert from rectangular to polar coordinates and from polar to
rectangular coordinates.
Convert from rectangular to polar equations and from polar to
rectangular equations.
Graph polar equations.
Polar Coordinates
All graphing throughout this text has been done with rectangular coor-
dinates,
, in the Cartesian coordinate system. We now introduce 
the polar coordinate system. As shown in the diagram at left, any point P
has rectangular coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
. On a 
polar graph, the origin is called the pole and the positive half of the 
x-axis is called the polar axis. The point P can be plotted given the di-
rected angle 
from the polar axis to the ray OP and the directed dis-
tance r from the pole to the point. The angle 
can be expressed in 
degrees or radians.
To plot points on a polar graph:
1. Locate the directed angle .
2. Move a directed distance r from the pole. If
, move along
ray OP. If
, move in the opposite direction of ray OP.

In this example, we see that the rectangular equation is simpler than
the polar equation.
EXAMPLE 5
Convert each of the following to a rectangular equation.

b)
c)
Solution
a) We have
Substituting for r

Squaring
In squaring, we must be careful not to introduce solutions of
the equation that are not already present. In this case, we did not,
because the graph of either equation is a circle of radius 4 centered 
at the origin.
b) We have
.
The graph of

, is a vertical line.
c) We have

Graphing Polar Equations
To graph a polar equation, we can make a table of values, choosing values
of
and calculating corresponding values of r. We plot the points and
complete the graph, as we do when graphing a rectangular equation. A
difference occurs in the case of a polar equation however, because as 
increases sufficiently, points may begin to repeat and the curve will be
traced again and again. When this happens, the curve is complete.

EXAMPLE 6
Graph:
.
Solution
We first make a table of values. The TABLE feature on a graph-
ing calculator is the most efficient way to create this list. Note that the
points begin to repeat at 
. We plot these points and draw the
curve, as shown below.
Because of its heart shape, this curve is called a cardioid.
We plotted points in Example 6 because we feel that it is important to
understand how these curves are developed. We also can graph polar equa-
tions using a graphing calculator. The equation usually must be written first
in the form 
. It is necessary to decide on not only the best window
dimensions but also the range of values for . Typically, we begin with a
range of 0 to 
for 
in radians and 0 to 360 for 
in degrees. Because
most polar graphs are curved, it is important to square the window to mini-
mize distortion.

We observe the same graph in both windows. The calculator allows us to
view the curve as it is formed.
Now graph each of the following equations and observe the effect of
changing the coefficient of
and the coefficient of
:
,
,
,
,
,
.
Polar equations of the form 
and 
have 
rose-shaped curves. The number a determines the length of the petals,
and the number n determines the number of petals. If n is odd, there are
n petals. If n is even, there are 2n petals.
EXAMPLE 7
Graph each of the following polar equations. Try to visu-
alize the shape of the curve before graphing it.
a)
b)
c)
Solution
For each graph, we can begin with a table of values. Then we
plot points and complete the graph.
a)
For all values of
, r is 3. Thus the graph of
is a circle of radius 3
centered at the origin.
We can verify our graph by converting to the equivalent rectan-
gular equation. For 
, we substitute 
for r and square.
The resulting equation,
,
is the equation of a circle with radius 3 centered at the origin.

Applications
Determine whether two vectors are equivalent.
Find the sum, or resultant, of two vectors.
Resolve a vector into its horizontal and vertical components.
Solve applied problems involving vectors.
We measure some quantities using only their magnitudes. For example,
we describe time, length, and mass using units like seconds, feet, and 
kilograms, respectively. However, to measure quantities like displace-
ment, velocity, or force, we need to describe a magnitude and a direc-
tion. Together magnitude and direction describe a vector. The following
are some examples.
DISPLACEMENT
An object moves a certain distance in a certain 
direction.
A surveyor steps 20 yd to the northeast.
A hiker follows a trail 5 mi to the west.
A batter hits a ball 100 m along the left-field line.
VELOCITY
An object travels at a certain speed in a certain direction.
A breeze is blowing 15 mph from the northwest.
An airplane is traveling 450 
in a direction of 243.
FORCE
A push or pull is exerted on an object in a certain direction.
A force of 200 lb is required to pull a cart up a 30 incline.
A 25-lb force is required to lift a box upward.
A force of 15 newtons is exerted downward on the handle of a jack.
(A newton, abbreviated N, is a unit of force used in physics, and
lb.)

Vectors and Applications

Vectors
Vectors can be graphically represented by directed line segments. The
length is chosen, according to some scale, to represent the magnitude of
the vector, and the direction of the directed line segment represents the
direction of the vector. For example, if we let 1 cm represent 5 
,
then a 15-
wind from the northwest would be represented by a di-
rected line segment 3 cm long, as shown in the figure at left.
Vector
A vector in the plane is a directed line segment. Two vectors are
equivalent if they have the same magnitude and direction.
Consider a vector drawn from point A to point B. Point A is called 
the initial point of the vector, and point B is called the terminal point.
Symbolic notation for this vector is 
(read “vector AB”). Vectors are
also denoted by boldface letters such as u, v, and w. The four vectors in
the figure at left have the same length and direction. Thus they represent
equivalent vectors; that is,
.
In the context of vectors, we use  to mean equivalent.
The length, or magnitude, of
is expressed as 
. In order to 
determine whether vectors are equivalent, we find their magnitudes and
directions.

Solution
We first find the length of each vector using the distance 
formula:
,
,
.
Thus
.
The vectors u,
, and w appear to go in the same direction so we
check their slopes. If the lines that they are on all have the same slope, the
vectors have the same direction. We calculate the slopes:
u
w
Slope
.
Since u,
, and w have the same magnitude and the same direction,
.
Keep in mind that the equivalence of vectors requires only the same
magnitude and the same direction—not the same location. In the illus-
trations at left, each of the first three pairs of vectors are not equivalent.
The fourth set of vectors is an example of equivalence.
Vector Addition
Suppose a person takes 4 steps east and then 3 steps north. He or she will
then be 5 steps from the starting point in the direction shown at left. A
vector 4 units long and pointing to the right represents 4 steps east and a
vector 3 units long and pointing up represents 3 steps north. The sum of
the two vectors is the vector 5 steps in magnitude and in the direction
shown. The sum is also called the resultant of the two vectors.
In general, two nonzero vectors u and v can be added geometrically
by placing the initial point of v at the terminal point of u and then find-
ing the vector that has the same initial point as u and the same terminal
point as v, as shown in the following figure.
The sum 
is the vector represented by the directed line segment
from the initial point A of u to the terminal point C of v. That is, if

We can also describe vector addition by placing the initial points of
the vectors together, completing a parallelogram, and finding the diago-
nal of the parallelogram. (See the figure on the left below.) This descrip-
tion of addition is sometimes called the parallelogram law of vector
addition. Vector addition is commutative. As shown in the figure on the
right below, both 
and 
are represented by the same directed
line segment.
Applications
If two forces 
and 
act on an object, the combined effect is the sum, or
resultant,
of the separate forces.
EXAMPLE 2
Forces of 15 newtons and 25 newtons act on an object at
right angles to each other. Find their sum, or resultant, giving the mag-
nitude of the resultant and the angle that it makes with the larger force.
Solution
We make a drawing—this time, a rectangle—using v or 
to
represent the resultant. To find the magnitude, we use the Pythagorean
theorem:
Here 
denotes the length, or magnitude, of v.
.
To find the direction, we note that since OAB is a right triangle,
.
Using a calculator, we find , the angle that the resultant makes with the
larger force:
.
The resultant 
has a magnitude of 29.2 and makes an angle of 31 with
the larger force.

Pilots must adjust the direction of their flight when there is a cross-
wind. Both the wind and the aircraft velocities can be described by 
vectors.
EXAMPLE 3
Airplane Speed and Direction.
An airplane travels on a
bearing of 100 at an airspeed of 190 
while a wind is blowing 
48 
from 220. Find the ground speed of the airplane and the direc-
tion of its track, or course, over the ground.
Solution
We first make a drawing. The wind is represented by 
and
the velocity vector of the airplane by 
. The resultant velocity vector is
v, the sum of the two vectors. The angle 
between v and 
is called a
drift angle.
Note that the measure of
. Thus the
measure of
is also 60 (opposite angles of a parallelogram are
equal). Since the sum of all the angles of the parallelogram is 360 and
and 
have the same measure, each must be 120. By the law
of cosines in 
, we have
.
Thus,

Thus,

218

Components
Given a vector w, we may want to find two other vectors u and v whose
sum is w. The vectors u and v are called components of w and the pro-
cess of finding them is called resolving, or representing, a vector into 
its vector components.
When we resolve a vector, we generally look for perpendicular com-
ponents. Most often, one component will be parallel to the x-axis and the
other will be parallel to the y-axis. For this reason, they are often called
the horizontal and vertical components of a vector. In the figure at left,
the vector 
is resolved as the sum of
and 
.
The horizontal component of w is u and the vertical component is v.
EXAMPLE 4
A vector w has a magnitude of 130 and is inclined 40
with the horizontal. Resolve the vector into horizontal and vertical 
components.
Solution
We first make a drawing showing horizontal and vertical vec-
tors u and v whose sum is w.
From 
, we find 
and 
using the definitions of the cosine
and sine functions:
,
or
,
,
or
.
Thus the horizontal component of w is 100 right, and the vertical com-
ponent of w is 84 up.
EXAMPLE 5
Shipping Crate.
A wooden shipping crate that weighs 
816 lb is placed on a loading ramp that makes an angle of 25 with the
horizontal. To keep the crate from sliding, a chain is hooked to the crate
and to a pole at the top of the ramp. Find the magnitude of the com-
ponents of the crate’s weight (disregarding friction) perpendicular and
parallel to the incline.
Solution
We first make a drawing illustrating the forces with a rect-
angle. We let
the weight of the crate
816 lb (force of gravity),
the magnitude of the component of the crate’s weight
perpendicular to the incline (force against the ramp),
and
the magnitude of the component of the crate’s weight
parallel to the incline (force that pulls the crate down
the ramp).

Solve applied problems involving forces in equilibrium.
Position Vectors
Let’s consider a vector v whose initial point is the origin in an xy-
coordinate system and whose terminal point is 
. We say that the 
vector is in standard position and refer to it as a position vector. Note
that the ordered pair 
defines the vector uniquely. Thus we can use
to denote the vector. To emphasize that we are thinking of a vector
and to avoid the confusion of notation with ordered-pair and interval 
notation, we generally write
.
The coordinate a is the scalar horizontal component of the vector, and
the coordinate b is the scalar vertical component of the vector. By 
scalar, we mean a numerical quantity rather than a vector quantity.
Thus,
is considered to be the component form of v. Note that a and 
b are not vectors and should not be confused with the vector component
definition given in Section 7.5.

Length of a Vector
The length, or magnitude, of a vector 
is given by

Two vectors are equivalent if they have the same magnitude and the
same direction.

Operations on Vectors
To multiply a vector v by a positive real number, we multiply its length 
by the number. Its direction stays the same. When a vector v is multi-
plied by 2 for instance, its length is doubled and its direction is not
changed. When a vector is multiplied by 1.6, its length is increased by 
60% and its direction stays the same. To multiply a vector v by a negative
real number, we multiply its length by the number and reverse its direc-
tion. When a vector is multiplied by 2, its length is doubled and its di-
rection is reversed. Since real numbers work like scaling factors in vector
multiplication, we call them scalars and the products kv are called 
scalar multiples of v.

cation, we need to define another special vector—the zero vector. The
vector whose initial and terminal points are both 
is the zero vec-
tor, denoted by O, or

zero vector is the additive identity vector:

Direction Angles
The terminal point P of a unit vector in standard position is a point on
the unit circle denoted by 
. Thus the unit vector can be ex-
pressed in component form,
,
or as a linear combination of the unit vectors i and j,
,
where the components of u are functions of the direction angle
mea-
sured counterclockwise from the x-axis to the vector. As 
varies from 0 
to 
, the point P traces the circle 
. This takes in all possible
directions for unit vectors so the equation 
de-
scribes every possible unit vector in the plane.

The bearing (measured from north) of the airspeed vector 
is 
100. Its direction angle (measured counterclockwise from the positive 
x-axis) is 350. The bearing (measured from north) of the wind vector 
is 220. Its direction angle (measured counterclockwise from the posi-

Thus the course of the airplane (the direction from north) is 
,
or 89.
Angle Between Vectors
When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the result is a vector. When two
vectors are added, the result is also a vector. Thus we might expect the
product of two vectors to be a vector as well, but it is not. The dot product
of two vectors is a real number, or scalar. This product is useful in find-
ing the angle between two vectors and in determining whether two vec-
tors are perpendicular.

sum must be O in order for a balance to occur. When a balance occurs,
then the object is either stationary or moving in a straight line without 
acceleration. The fact that the vector sum must be O for a balance, and
vice versa, allows us to solve many applied problems involving forces.

EXAMPLE 13
Suspended Block.
A 350-lb block is suspended by two
cables, as shown at left. At point A, there are three forces acting: W,
the block pulling down, and R and S, the two cables pulling upward and
outward. Find the tension in each cable.
Solution
We draw a force diagram with the initial points of each vec-
tor at the origin. For there to be a balance, the vector sum must be the 
vector O:
.
We can express each vector in terms of its magnitude and its direction
angle:
,
,
and
.
;
Substituting for R, S, and W in 
, we have
.
This gives us a system of equations:
,
.
Solving this system, we get
and
.
The tensions in the cables are 280 lb and 201 lb.

It is often argued 
in golf that the farther you hit the ball, the more
accurate it must be to stay safe. (Safe means not in
the woods, water, or some other hazard.) In his 
book Golf and the Spirit (p. 54), M. Scott Peck 
asserts “Deviate 5 from your aiming point on a 
150-yd shot, and your ball will land approximately 
20 yd to the side of where you wanted it to be. Do
the same on a 300-yd shot, and it will be 40 yd off
target. Twenty yards may well be in the range of
safety; 40 yards probably won’t. This principle not
infrequently allows a mediocre, short-hitting golfer
like myself to score better than the long hitter.”
Check the accuracy of the mathematics in this
statement, and comment on Peck’s assertion.

Systems of
Equations in
Two Variables
Solve a system of two linear equations in two variables by graphing.
Solve a system of two linear equations in two variables using the
substitution and the elimination methods.
Use systems of two linear equations to solve applied problems.
A system of equations is composed of two or more equations considered
simultaneously. For example,
,
is a system of two linear equations in two variables. The solution set of
this system consists of all ordered pairs that make both equations true. The
ordered pair 
is a solution of the system of equations above. We can
verify this by substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in each equation.
TRUE
TRUE
Solving Systems of Equations Graphically
Recall that the graph of a linear equation is a line that contains all the
ordered pairs in the solution set of the equation. When we graph a system 
of linear equations, each point at which the graphs intersect is a solution of
both equations and therefore a solution of the system of equations.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve the following system of equations graphically.
,

We graph the equations on the same set of axes, as shown below.

We see that the graphs intersect at a single point,
, so 
is the solution of the system of equations. To check this solution, we sub-
stitute 2 for x and 3 for y in both equations as we did above.
To use a graphing calculator to solve this system of equations, it might
be necessary to write each equation in “
” form. If so, we would graph
and 
and then use the INTERSECT feature. We see
that the solution is 
The graphs of most of the systems of equations that we use to model
applications intersect at a single point, like the system above. However, it is
possible that the graphs will have no points in common or infinitely many
points in common. Each of these possibilities is illustrated below.

If a system of equations has at least one solution, it is consistent. If the
system has no solutions, it is inconsistent. In addition, if a system of two
linear equations in two variables has an infinite number of solutions, the
equations are dependent. Otherwise, they are independent.
The Substitution Method
Solving a system of equations graphically is not always accurate when the
solutions are not integers. A solution like 
, for instance, will be dif-
ficult to determine from a hand-drawn graph.
Algebraic methods for solving systems of equations, when used cor-
rectly, always give accurate results. One such technique is the substitution


method. It is used most often when a variable is alone on one side of an
equation or when it is easy to solve for a variable. To apply the substitution
method, we begin by using one of the equations to express one variable in
terms of the other; then we substitute that expression in the other equation
of the system.
EXAMPLE 2
Use the substitution method to solve the system
,
(1)
.
(2)
Solution
First, we solve equation (1) for x. (We could have solved for y
instead.) We have
,
(1)
.
Solving for x
Then we substitute 
for x in equation (2). This gives an equation in
one variable, which we know how to solve:
(2)
The parentheses are necessary.
Removing parentheses
Collecting like terms on the left
Subtracting 10 on both sides
.
Dividing by 3 on both sides
Now we substitute 3 for y in either of the original equations (this is called
back-substitution) and solve for x. We choose equation (1):
,
(1)
Substituting 3 for y
.
Subtracting 3 on both sides
We have previously checked the pair 
in both equations. The solu-
tion of the system of equations is 
.
The Elimination Method
Another algebraic technique for solving systems of equations is the elimi-
nation method. With this method, we eliminate a variable by adding
two equations. If the coefficients of a particular variable are opposites, we
can eliminate that variable simply by adding the original equations. For ex-
ample, if the x-coefficient is 3 in one equation and is 3 in the other equa-
tion, then the sum of the x-terms will be 0 and thus the variable x will be
eliminated when we add the equations.

We then back-substitute 5 for y in either equation (1) or (2) and solve for x.
We choose equation (1):
(1)
Substituting 5 for y
.
We can check the pair 
by substituting in both equations or graphi-
cally, as shown at left. The solution is 
.
In Example 4, the two systems
,
and
,
are equivalent because they have exactly the same solutions. When we
use the elimination method, we often multiply one or both equations by
constants to find equivalent equations that allow us to eliminate a vari-
able by adding.
EXAMPLE 5
Solve each of the following systems using the elimination
method.
a)
,
(1)
b)
,
(1)
(2)
(2)
Solution
a) We multiply equation (1) by 2 and add:
Multiplying equation (1) by 2
(2)
.
Adding
There are no values of x and y for which 
is true, so the system has
no solution. The solution set is 
. The system of equations is inconsis-
tent. The graphs of the equations are parallel lines, as shown in Fig. 1.
b) We multiply equation (1) by 2 and add:
Multiplying equation (1) by 2
(2)
.
Adding
We obtain the equation 
, which is true for all values of x and y.
This tells us that the equations are dependent, so there are infinitely
many solutions. That is, any solution of one equation of the system is
also a solution of the other. The graphs of the equations are identical, as
shown in Fig. 2.

Solving either equation for y, we have 
, so we can write
the solutions of the system as ordered pairs 
, where y is expressed as
. Thus the solutions can be written in the form 
.
Any real value that we choose for x then gives us a value for y and thus an
ordered pair in the solution set. For example,
if
,
then 
,
if
,
then 
,
and
if
,
then 
.
Thus some of the solutions are 
,
, and 
. Similarly, solv-
ing either equation for x, we have 
, so the solutions 
can
also be written, expressing x as 
, in the form 
.
Applications
Frequently the most challenging and time-consuming step in the problem-
solving process is translating a situation to mathematical language. How-
ever, in many cases, this task is made easier if we translate to more than one
equation in more than one variable.
EXAMPLE 6
Snack Mixtures.
At SmartSnax.com, caramel corn worth
$2.50 per pound is mixed with honey roasted mixed nuts worth $7.50 per
pound in order to get 20 lb of a mixture worth $4.50 per pound. How much
of each snack is used?
Solution
We use the five-step problem-solving process.
1.
Familiarize. Let’s begin by making a guess. Suppose 16 lb of caramel
corn and 4 lb of nuts are used. Then the total weight of the mixture
would be 
, or 20 lb, the desired weight. The total values of
these amounts of ingredients are found by multiplying the price per
pound by the number of pounds used:
Caramel corn:
Nuts:
Total value:
.
The desired value of the mixture is $4.50 per pound, so the value of
20 lb would be 
, or $90. Thus we see that our guess, which led
to a total of $70, is incorrect. Nevertheless, these calculations will help us
to translate.
2.
Translate. We organize the information in a table. We let 
the num-
ber of pounds of caramel corn in the mixture and 
the number of
pounds of nuts.

Check. If 12 lb of caramel corn and 8 lb of nuts are used, the mix-
ture weighs 
, or 20 lb. The value of the mixture is 
, or 
, or $90. Since the possible solution yields the
desired weight and value of the mixture, our result checks.
5.
State. The mixture should consist of 12 lb of caramel corn and 8 lb of
honey roasted nuts.
EXAMPLE 7
Boating.
Kerry’s motorboat takes 3 hr to make a down-
stream trip with a 3-mph current. The return trip against the same cur-
rent takes 5 hr. Find the speed of the boat in still water.
Solution
1.
Familiarize. We first make a drawing, letting 
the speed of the boat
in still water, in miles per hour, and 
the distance traveled, in miles.
When the boat is traveling downstream, the current adds to its speed, so
the downstream speed is 
. On the other hand, the current slows the
boat down when it travels upstream, so the upstream speed is 
.
2.
Translate. We organize the information in a table. Using the formula
, we find that each row of the table
yields an equation.
We have a system of equations:

Check. If
, then the boat’s speed downstream is 
, or 15 mph, and the speed upstream is 
, or 
9 mph. At 15 mph, in 3 hr the boat travels 
mi; at 9 mph,
in 5 hr the boat travels 
mi. Since the distances are the
same, the answer checks.
5.
State. The speed of the boat in still water is 12 mph.
EXAMPLE 8
Supply and Demand.
Suppose that the price and the sup-
ply of the Star Station satellite radio are related by the equation
,
where y is the price, in dollars, at which the seller is willing to supply 
x thousand units. Also suppose that the price and the demand for the
same model of satellite radio are related by the equation
,
where y is the price, in dollars, at which the consumer is willing to buy 
x thousand units.
The equilibrium point for this product is the pair 
that is a 
solution of both equations. The equilibrium price is the price at which
the amount of the product that the seller is willing to supply is the same
as the amount demanded by the consumer. Find the equilibrium point for
this product.

statement of the problem, so no further translation is necessary.

Systems of
Equations in
Three Variables
Solve systems of linear equations in three variables.
Use systems of three equations to solve applied problems.
Model a situation using a quadratic function.
A linear equation in three variables is an equation equivalent to one of
the form 
, where A, B, C, and D are real numbers and
A, B, and C are not all 0. A solution of a system of three equations in
three variables is an ordered triple that makes all three equations true. For
example, the triple 
is a solution of the system of equations
,
,
.
We can verify this by substituting 2 for x, 1 for y, and 0 for z in each
equation.
Solving Systems of Equations in Three Variables
We will solve systems of equations in three variables using an algebraic
method called Gaussian elimination, named for the German mathe-
matician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). Our goal is to transform the
original system to an equivalent one of the form
,
,
.
Then we solve the third equation for z and back-substitute to find y and
then x.
Each of the following operations can be used to transform the origi-
nal system to an equivalent system in the desired form.
1. Interchange any two equations.
2. Multiply both sides of one of the equations by a nonzero
constant.
3. Add a nonzero multiple of one equation to another equation.

Solution
First, we choose one of the variables to eliminate using two dif-
ferent pairs of equations. Let’s eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). We
multiply equation (1) by 4 and add it to equation (2). We also multiply
equation (1) by 3 and add it to equation (3).

Next, we multiply equation (5) by 10 to make the y-coefficient a multi-
ple of the y-coefficient in the equation above it:

Next, we multiply equation (4) by 9 and add it to equation (6):

We now have the system of equations

Now we solve equation (7) for z:

Then we back-substitute 2 for z in equation (4) and solve for y:

Finally, we back-substitute 1 for y and 2 for z in equation (1) and solve
for x:

We can check the triple 
in each of the three original equations.
Since it makes all three equations true, the solution is 
.
EXAMPLE 2
Solve the following system:
,
(1)
,
(2)
.
(3)
Solution
We multiply equation (1) by 3 and add it to equation (2). We
also multiply equation (1) by 1 and add it to equation (3).
,
(1)
,
(4)
(5)
Next, we add equation (4) to equation (5):
,
(1)
,
(4)
.
The equation 
tells us that equation (3) of the original system is 
dependent on the first two equations. Thus the original system is equiva-
lent to
,
(1)
.
(2)
In this particular case, the original system has infinitely many solutions. (In
some cases, a system containing dependent equations could be inconsistent.)
To find an expression for these solutions, we first solve equation (4) for 
either y or z. We choose to solve for y:
(4)
.
Then we back-substitute in equation (1) to find an expression for x in
terms of z:

The solutions of the system of equations are ordered triples of the form
, where z can be any real number. Any real number
that we use for z then gives us values for x and y and thus an ordered triple
in the solution set. For example, if we choose 
, we have the solution
. If we choose 
, we have 
.
If we get a false equation, such as 
, at some stage of the elimina-
tion process, we conclude that the original system is inconsistent. That is, it
has no solutions.
Although systems of three linear equations in three variables do not
lend themselves well to graphical solutions, it is of interest to picture some
possible solutions. The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a
plane. Thus the solution set of such a system is the intersection of three
planes. Some possibilities are shown below.
Applications
Systems of equations in three or more variables allow us to solve many
problems in fields such as business, the social and natural sciences, and
engineering.
EXAMPLE 3
Investment.
Moira inherited $15,000 and invested part of
it in a money market account, part in municipal bonds, and part in a mutual
fund. After 1 yr, she received a total of $730 in simple interest from the three
investments. The money market account paid 4% annually, the bonds paid
5% annually, and the mutual fund paid 6% annually. There was $2000 more
invested in the mutual fund than in bonds. Find the amount that Moira in-
vested in each category.

Solution
1.
Familiarize. We let x, y, and z represent the amounts invested in the
money market account, the bonds, and the mutual fund, respectively.
Then the amounts of income produced annually by each investment are
given by 4%x, 5%y, and 6%z, or 0.04x, 0.05y, and 0.06z.
2.
Translate. The fact that a total of $15,000 is invested gives us one
equation:
.
Since the total interest is $730, we have a second equation:
.
Another statement in the problem gives us a third equation.
The amount invested
was
$2000
more than
the amount invested
in the mutual fund
in bonds.

4.
Check. The sum of the numbers is 15,000. The income produced is
,
or
$730.
Also the amount invested in the mutual fund, $5000, is $2000 more
than the amount invested in bonds, $3000. Our solution checks in 
the original problem.
5.
State. Moira invested $7000 in a money market account, $3000 in
municipal bonds, and $5000 in a mutual fund.
Mathematical Models and Applications
In a situation in which a quadratic function will serve as a
mathematical model, we may wish to find an equation, or for-
mula, for the function. For a linear model, we can find an equa-
tion if we know two data points. For a quadratic function, we
need three data points.
EXAMPLE 4
The Cost of Operating an Automobile at Various
Speeds.
Under certain conditions, it is found that the cost of
operating an automobile as a function of speed is approximated

by a quadratic function. Use the data shown below to find the function.
Then use the function to determine the cost of operating the automobile at
60 mph and at 80 mph.
Solution
Letting 
the speed and 
the cost per mile, in cents, we
use the three data points 
,
, and 
to find a, b, and c in
the equation 
. First we substitute:
bx
For

We now have a system of equations in the variables a, b, and c:
,
,
.
Solving this system of equations, we obtain 
. Thus,
.
To determine the cost of operating an automobile at 60 mph, we find
:
per mile.
To find the cost of operating an automobile at 80 mph, we find 
:
per mile.
The function in Example 4 can also be found using the QUADRATIC 
REGRESSION feature on a graphing calculator. Note that the method of
Example 4 works when we have exactly three data points, whereas the
QUADRATIC REGRESSION feature on a graphing calculator can be used for
three or more points.

Matrices and Row-Equivalent Operations
In this section, we consider additional techniques for solving systems of
equations. You have probably observed that when we solve a system of equa-
tions, we perform computations with the coefficients and the constants and
continually rewrite the variables. We can streamline the solution process by
omitting the variables until a solution is found. For example, the system
,
can be written more simply as
.
The vertical line replaces the equals signs.
A rectangular array of numbers like the one above is called a matrix (pl.,
matrices). The matrix above is called an augmented matrix for the given
system of equations, because it contains not only the coefficients but also the
constant terms. The matrix
is called the coefficient matrix of the system.
The rows of a matrix are horizontal, and the columns are vertical. The
augmented matrix above has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the coefficient
matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns. A matrix with m rows and n columns 
is said to be of order
. Thus the order of the augmented matrix
above is 
, and the order of the coefficient matrix is 
. When
, a matrix is said to be square. The coefficient matrix above is a
square matrix. The numbers 2 and 4 lie on the main diagonal of the coef-
ficient matrix. The numbers in a matrix are called entries.

Gaussian Elimination with Matrices
In Section 8.2, we described a series of operations that can be used to trans-
form a system of equations to an equivalent system. Each of these operations
corresponds to one that can be used to produce row-equivalent matrices.
Row-Equivalent Operations
1. Interchange any two rows.
2. Multiply each entry in a row by the same nonzero constant.
3. Add a nonzero multiple of one row to another row.
We can use these operations on the augmented matrix of a system of
equations to solve the system.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve the following system:
,
,
.
Solution
First, we write the augmented matrix, writing 0 for the missing
y-term in the last equation:
.
Our goal is to find a row-equivalent matrix of the form
.
The variables can then be reinserted to form equations from which we can
complete the solution. This is done by working from the bottom equation to
the top and using back-substitution.
The first step is to multiply and/or interchange rows so that each num-
ber in the first column below the first number is a multiple of that number.
In this case, we interchange the first and second rows to obtain a 1 in the
upper left-hand corner.

Next, we multiply the first row by 2 and add it to the second row. We also
multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the third row.
Now we multiply the second row by to get a 1 in the second row, second
column.
New row 2
Then we multiply the second row by 6 and add it to the third row.
Finally, we multiply the third row by 
to get a 1 in the third row, third
column.
Now we can write the system of equations that corresponds to the last 
matrix:
,

We back-substitute

Next, we back-substitute 7 for y and 
for z in equation (1) and solve 
for x:
.
The triple 
checks in the original system of equations, so it is
the solution.

Row-equivalent operations can be performed on a graphing calculator.
For example, to interchange the first and second rows of the augmented ma-
trix, as we did in the first step in Example 1, we enter the matrix as matrix A
and select “rowSwap” from the MATRIX MATH menu. Some graphing calcu-
lators will not automatically store the matrix produced using a row-equiva-
lent operation, so when several operations are to be performed in succession,
it is helpful to store the result of each operation as it is produced. In the win-
dow at left, we see both the matrix produced by the rowSwap operation and
the indication that this matrix is stored as matrix B.
The procedure followed in Example 1 is called Gaussian elimina-
tion with matrices. The last matrix in Example 1 is in row-echelon form.
To be in this form, a matrix must have the following properties.
Row-Echelon Form
1. If a row does not consist entirely of 0’s, then the first nonzero 
element in the row is a 1 (called a leading 1).
2. For any two successive nonzero rows, the leading 1 in the lower
row is farther to the right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
3. All the rows consisting entirely of 0’s are at the bottom of the
matrix.
If a fourth property is also satisfied, a matrix is said to be in reduced
row-echelon form:
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has 0’s everywhere else.
EXAMPLE 2
Which of the following matrices are in row-echelon form?
Which, if any, are in reduced row-echelon form?

Solution
The matrices in (a), (d), and (e) satisfy the row-echelon criteria
and, thus, are in row-echelon form. In (b) and (c), the first nonzero elements
of the first and second rows, respectively, are not 1. In (f), the row consist-
ing entirely of 0’s is not at the bottom of the matrix. Thus the matrices in (b),
(c), and (f) are not in row-echelon form. In (d) and (e), not only are the
row-echelon criteria met but each column that contains a leading 1 also has
0’s elsewhere, so these matrices are in reduced row-echelon form.

Gauss–Jordan Elimination
We have seen that with Gaussian elimination we perform row-equivalent
operations on a matrix to obtain a row-equivalent matrix in row-echelon
form. When we continue to apply these operations until we have a ma-
trix in reduced row-echelon form, we are using Gauss–Jordan elimi-
nation. This method is named for Karl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm 
Jordan (1842–1899).
EXAMPLE 3
Use Gauss–Jordan elimination to solve the system of equa-
tions in Example 1.
Solution
Using Gaussian elimination in Example 1, we obtained the
matrix
.
We continue to perform row-equivalent operations until we have a matrix in
reduced row-echelon form. We multiply the third row by 10 and add it to the
first row. We also multiply the third row by 8 and add it to the second row.
Next, we multiply the second row by 2 and add it to the first row.
Writing the system of equations that corresponds to this matrix, we have
,
,
.
We can actually read the solution,
, directly from the last column of
the reduced row-echelon matrix.
We can also use a graphing calculator to solve this system of equations.
After the augmented matrix is entered, reduced row-echelon form can be
found directly using the “rref” operation from the MATRIX MATH menu.

EXAMPLE 4
Solve the following system:
,
,
.
Solution
We write the augmented matrix and use Gauss–Jordan 
elimination.
We begin by multiplying the second and third rows by 3 so that 
each number in the first column below the first number, 3, is a multiple
of that number.
Next, we multiply the first row by 2 and add it to the second row. We also
multiply the first row by 4 and add it to the third row.
Now we add the second row to the third row.
We can stop at this stage because we have a row consisting entirely of 0’s.
The last row of the matrix corresponds to the equation 
, which is true
for all values of x, y, and z. Consequently, the equations are dependent and
the system is equivalent to
,
.
This particular system has infinitely many solutions. (A system containing
dependent equations could be inconsistent.)
Solving the second equation for y gives us
.
Substituting 
for y in the first equation and solving for x, we get
.

Then the solutions of this system are of the form
,
where z can be any real number.
Similarly, if we obtain a row whose only nonzero entry occurs in the
last column, we have an inconsistent system of equations. For example,
in the matrix
,
the last row corresponds to the false equation 
, so we know the origi-
nal system of equations has no solution.

Matrix
Operations
Add, subtract, and multiply matrices when possible.
Write a matrix equation equivalent to a system of equations.
In Section 8.3, we used matrices to solve systems of equations. Matrices are
useful in many other types of applications as well. In this section, we study
matrices and some of their properties.
A capital letter is generally used to name a matrix, and lower-case 
letters with double subscripts generally denote its entries. For example,
, read “a sub four seven,” indicates the entry in the fourth row and the
seventh column. A general term is represented by 
. The notation 
indi-
cates the entry in row i and column j. In general, we can write a matrix as
.
The matrix above has m rows and n columns. That is, its order is 
.
Two matrices are equal if they have the same order and corresponding
entries are equal.

Systems of Equations and Matrices
Matrix Addition and Subtraction
To add or subtract matrices, we add or subtract their corresponding entries.
The matrices must have the same order for this to be possible.
Addition and Subtraction of Matrices
Given two 
matrices 
and 
, their sum is
and their difference is
.
Addition of matrices is both commutative and associative.
EXAMPLE 1
Find 
for each of the following.
a)
,
b)
,
Solution
We have a pair of
matrices in part (a) and a pair of
matrices in part (b). Since each pair of matrices has the same order,
we can add the corresponding entries.
a)
We can also enter A and B in a graphing calculator and then find 
b)
This sum can also be found on a graphing calculator after A and B have
been entered.

EXAMPLE 2
Find 
for each of the following.
a)
,
b)
,
Solution
a) Since the order of each matrix is 
, we can subtract corresponding
entries:
.
This subtraction can also be done using a graphing calculator.
b) C is a 
matrix and D is a 
matrix. Since the matrices do not
have the same order, we cannot subtract.
The opposite, or additive inverse, of a matrix is obtained by replac-
ing each entry with its opposite.
EXAMPLE 3

A matrix having 0’s for all its entries is called a zero matrix. When a zero
matrix is added to a second matrix of the same order, the second matrix is
unchanged. Thus a zero matrix is an additive identity. For example,
is the additive identity for any 
matrix.
Scalar Multiplication
When we find the product of a number and a matrix, we obtain a scalar
product.
Scalar Product
The scalar product of a number k and a matrix A is the matrix
denoted kA, obtained by multiplying each entry of A by the 
number k. The number k is called a scalar.
EXAMPLE 4
Find 3A and 
for
.
Solution
We have
,
.
These scalar products can also be found on a graphing calculator after A has
been entered.

Systems of Equations and Matrices
Products of Matrices
Matrix multiplication is defined in such a way that it can be used in solving
systems of equations and in many applications.
Matrix Multiplication
For an 
matrix 
and an 
matrix 
, the
product
is an 
matrix, where
.
In other words, the entry 
in AB is obtained by multiplying the 
entries in row i of A by the corresponding entries in column j of B and
adding the results.
Note that we can multiply two matrices only when the number of
columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the
second matrix.

a) AB
b) BA
c) BC
d) AC

a) A is a 
matrix and B is a 
matrix, so AB will be a 
matrix.

lon of frozen yogurt, it is $3. Use matrices to find the total profit on these
items at each store for the given week.
Solution
We can write the table showing the distribution of the products
as a 
matrix:
.
The profit per gallon for each product can also be written as a matrix:
.
Then the total profit at each store is given by the matrix product PD:
.
The total profit on no-fat ice cream and frozen yogurt for the given week
was $880 at store 1, $680 at store 2, and $780 at store 3.
A matrix that consists of a single row, like P in Example 7, is called a row
matrix. Similarly, a matrix that consists of a single column, like
,
is called a column matrix.
We have already seen that matrix multiplication is generally not com-
mutative. Nevertheless, matrix multiplication does have some properties
that are similar to those for multiplication of real numbers.

Solution
We write the coefficients on the left in a matrix. We then write
the product of that matrix and the column matrix containing the vari-
ables, and set the result equal to the column matrix containing the con-
stants on the right:

Systems of Equations and Matrices
8.5
Inverses of
Matrices
Find the inverse of a square matrix, if it exists.
Use inverses of matrices to solve systems of equations.
In this section, we continue our study of matrix algebra, finding the 
multiplicative inverse, or simply inverse, of a square matrix, if it exists.
Then we use such inverses to solve systems of equations.
The Identity Matrix
Recall that, for real numbers,
; 1 is the multiplicative
identity. A multiplicative identity matrix is very similar to the number 1.
Identity Matrix
For any positive integer n, the 
identity matrix is an 
matrix with 1’s on the main diagonal and 0’s elsewhere and is
denoted by
.
Then 
, for any 
matrix A.

verse of a matrix behaves in a similar manner.
Inverse of a Matrix
For an 
matrix A, if there is a matrix 
for which
, then 
is the inverse of A.
We read 
as “A inverse.” Note that not every matrix has an inverse.
EXAMPLE 2
Verify that
is the inverse of
.
Solution
We show that 
.
We can find the inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, by using row-
equivalent operations as in the Gauss–Jordan elimination method. For
example, consider the matrix
.
To find its inverse, we first form an augmented matrix consisting of A
on the left side and the 
identity matrix on the right side:

Solution
First, we write the augmented matrix. Then we transform it to
the desired form.
Thus,
.
If a matrix has an inverse, we say that it is invertible, or nonsingu-
lar. When we cannot obtain the identity matrix on the left using the
Gauss–Jordan method, then no inverse exists. This occurs when we obtain
a row consisting entirely of 0’s in either of the two matrices in the aug-
mented matrix. In this case, we say that A is a singular matrix.
When we try to find the inverse of a noninvertible, or singular, matrix
using a graphing calculator, the calculator returns an error message similar
to ERR: SINGULAR MATRIX.

Solving Systems of Equations
We can write a system of n linear equations in n variables as a matrix
equation 
. If A has an inverse, then the system of equations has a
unique solution that can be found by solving for X, as follows:
Multiplying by 
on the left on both sides
Using the associative property 
of matrix multiplication
.
Matrix Solutions of Systems of Equations
For a system of n linear equations in n variables,
, if A is an
invertible matrix, then the unique solution of the system is given by
.
Since matrix multiplication is not commutative in general, care must
be taken to multiply on the left by 
.
EXAMPLE 5
Use an inverse matrix to solve the following system of
equations:
,
.
Solution
We write an equivalent matrix equation,
:
A
X
B
In Example 3, we found that
.
We also verified this in Example 2. Now we have
.
The solution of the system of equations is 
.
To use a graphing calculator to solve this system of equations, we enter 
A and B and then enter the notation

Determinants
and Cramer’s Rule
Evaluate determinants of square matrices.
Use Cramer’s rule to solve systems of equations.
Determinants of Square Matrices
With every square matrix, we associate a number called its determinant.
Determinant of a 
Matrix
The determinant of the matrix 
is denoted 
and 
is defined as
.
EXAMPLE 1
Evaluate:
.
Solution
The arrows indicate the products involved.
We now consider a way to evaluate determinants of square matrices of
order 
or higher.
Evaluating Determinants Using Cofactors
Often we first find minors and cofactors of matrices in order to evaluate
determinants.
Minor
For a square matrix 
, the minor
of an element 
is 
the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the ith row and 
the jth column of A.

Determinants and Cramer’s Rule
729
Consider the matrix A given by
.
The determinant of the matrix, denoted 
, can be found by multiplying
each element of the first column by its cofactor and adding:
.
Because
,
,
and
,
we can write
.
It can be shown that we can determine 
by choosing any row or column,
multiplying each element in that row or column by its cofactor, and adding.
This is called expanding across a row or down a column. We just expanded
down the first column. We now define the determinant of a square matrix
of any order.
Determinant of Any Square Matrix
For any square matrix A of order 
(
), we define the
determinant of A, denoted 
, as follows. Choose any row or
column. Multiply each element in that row or column by its cofactor
and add the results. The determinant of a 
matrix is simply the
element of the matrix. The value of a determinant will be the same
no matter which row or column is chosen.

First enter A. Then select the determinant operation, det, from
the MATRIX MATH menu and enter the name of the matrix, A. The calcula-
tor will return the value of the determinant of the matrix, 26.
Cramer’s Rule
Determinants can be used to solve systems of linear equations. Consider a
system of two linear equations:
,
.
Solving this system using the elimination method, we obtain

Determinants and Cramer’s Rule
731
The numerators and denominators of these expressions can be written as
determinants:
and
.
If we let
,
,
and
,
we have
and
.
This procedure for solving systems of equations is known as Cramer’s rule.
Cramer’s Rule for 
Systems
The solution of the system of equations
,
is given by
,
,
where
,
,
,
and
.
Note that the denominator D contains the coefficients of x and y, in
the same position as in the original equations. For x, the numerator is 
obtained by replacing the x-coefficients in D (the a’s) with the c’s. For y,
the numerator is obtained by replacing the y-coefficients in D (the b’s)
with the c’s.

EXAMPLE 6
Solve using Cramer’s rule:

.
Solution
We have
,
.
The solution is 
.
To use Cramer’s rule to solve this system of equations on a graphing cal-
culator, we first enter the matrices corresponding to D,
, and 
. We enter
,
,
and
.
Then
and
.
Cramer’s rule works only when a system of equations has a unique 
solution. This occurs when 
. If
and 
and 
are also 0,
then the equations are dependent. If
and 
and/or 
is not 0,
then the system is inconsistent.
Cramer’s rule can be extended to a system of n linear equations in 
n variables. We consider a 
system.

Note that the determinant

In practice, it is not necessary to evaluate 
. When we have found val-
ues for x and y, we can substitute them into one of the equations to find z.

Graph linear inequalities.
Graph systems of linear inequalities.
Solve linear programming problems.
A graph of an inequality is a drawing that represents its solutions. We have
already seen that an inequality in one variable can be graphed on a number
line. An inequality in two variables can be graphed on a coordinate plane.
Graphs of Linear Inequalities
A statement like 
is a linear inequality in two variables.
Linear Inequality in Two Variables
A linear inequality in two variables is an inequality that can be
written in the form
,
where A, B, and C are real numbers and A and B are not both zero.
The symbol 
may be replaced with 
,
, or 
.
A solution of a linear inequality in two variables is an ordered pair
for which the inequality is true. For example,
is a solution 
of
because 
, or 
, is true. On the
other hand,
is not a solution of
because 
, or 
.
The solution set of an inequality is the set of all ordered pairs that
make it true. The graph of an inequality represents its solution set.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph:
.
Solution
We begin by graphing the related equation
. We use
a dashed line because the inequality symbol is 
. This indicates that the
line itself is not in the solution set of the inequality.
Note that the line divides the coordinate plane into two regions called
half-planes. One of these half-planes satisfies the inequality. Either all points
in a half-plane are in the solution set of the inequality or none is.
To determine which half-plane satisfies the inequality, we try a test point
in either region. The point 
is usually a convenient choice so long as it
does not lie on the line.
TRUE
is true.

Since 
satisfies the inequality, so do all points in the half-plane that con-
tains 
. We shade this region to show the solution set of the inequality.
In general, we use the following procedure to graph linear inequalities
in two variables.
To graph a linear inequality in two variables:
1. Replace the inequality symbol with an equals sign and graph this
related equation. If the inequality symbol is 
or 
, draw the line
dashed. If the inequality symbol is 
or 
, draw the line solid.
2. The graph consists of a half-plane on one side of the line and, if
the line is solid, the line as well. To determine which half-plane to
shade, test a point not on the line in the original inequality. If that
point is a solution, shade the half-plane containing that point. If
not, shade the opposite half-plane.
EXAMPLE 2
Graph:
.
Solution
1. First, we graph the related equation 
. We use a solid 
line because the inequality symbol is 
. This indicates that the line 
is included in the solution set.
2. To determine which half-plane to shade, we test a point in either region.
We choose 
.
FALSE
is false.
Because 
is not a solution, all the points in the half-plane that does
not contain 
are solutions. We shade that region, as shown in the fig-
ure at left.

To graph this inequality on a graphing calculator, we first enter the 
related equation in the form 
Then we select the “shade 
above” graph style.
EXAMPLE 3
Graph 
on a plane.
Solution
1. First, we graph the related equation 
. We use a dashed line 
because the inequality symbol is 
. This indicates that the line is not
included in the solution set.
2. The inequality tells us that all points 
for which 
are solu-
tions. These are the points to the right of the line. We can also use a test
point to determine the solutions. We choose 
.
TRUE
is true.
Because 
is a solution, we
shade the region containing that
point—that is, the region to the
right of the dashed line.

2. The inequality tells us that all points 
for which 
are solutions
of the inequality. These are the points on or below the line. We can also
use a test point to determine the solutions. We choose 
.
FALSE
is false.
Because 
is not a solution,
we shade the half-plane that does
not contain that point.
We can use a graphing calculator to graph the inequality 
by
first graphing 
and then using the “shade below” graph style.
Systems of Linear Inequalities
A system of inequalities in two variables consists of two or more inequali-
ties in two variables considered simultaneously. For example,
,
is a system of two linear inequalities in two variables.
A solution of a system of inequalities is an ordered pair that is a solu-
tion of each inequality in the system. To graph a system of linear inequali-
ties, we graph each inequality and determine the region that is common 
to all the solution sets.

EXAMPLE 5
Graph the solution set of the system
,
.
Solution
We graph 
by first graphing the equation 
using a solid line. Next, we choose 
as a test point and find that it is a
solution of
, so we shade the half-plane containing 
using
red. Next, we graph 
using a solid line. We find that 
is not
a solution of
, so we shade the half-plane that does not contain
using green. The arrows at the ends of each line help to indicate the
half-plane that contains each solution set.
The solution set of the system of equations is the region shaded both
red and green, or brown, including parts of the lines 
and
.
We can use different shading patterns on a graphing calculator to graph
this system of inequalities. The solution set is the region shaded using 
both patterns.
A system of inequalities may have a graph that consists of a polygon
and its interior. As we will see later in this section, it is important in many
applications to be able to find the vertices of such a polygon.

Systems of Equations and Matrices
Applications: Linear Programming
In many applications, we want to find a maximum or minimum value. In
business, for example, we might want to maximize profit and minimize
cost. Linear programming can tell us how to do this.
In our study of linear programming, we will consider linear functions of
two variables that are to be maximized or minimized subject to several con-
ditions, or constraints. These constraints are expressed as inequalities. The
solution set of the system of inequalities made up of the constraints contains
all the feasible solutions of a linear programming problem. The function
that we want to maximize or minimize is called the objective function.
It can be shown that the maximum and minimum values of the objec-
tive function occur at a vertex of the region of feasible solutions. Thus we
have the following procedure.
Linear Programming Procedure
To find the maximum or minimum value of a linear objective
function subject to a set of constraints:
1. Graph the region of feasible solutions.
2. Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the region.
3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex. The largest and
smallest of those values are the maximum and minimum 
values of the function, respectively.
EXAMPLE 7
Maximizing Profit.
Dovetail Carpentry Shop makes
bookcases and desks. Each bookcase requires 5 hr of woodworking and 
4 hr of finishing. Each desk requires 10 hr of woodworking and 3 hr of
finishing. Each month the shop has 600 hr of labor available for wood-
working and 240 hr for finishing. The profit on each bookcase is $40 and
on each desk is $75. How many of each product should be made each
month in order to maximize profit?
Copyright © 2006 Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Addison-Wesley

Solution
We let 
the number of bookcases to be produced and 
the number of desks. Then the profit P is given by the function
.
To emphasize that P is a function of two variables,
we sometimes write 
.
We know that x bookcases require 5x hr of woodworking and y desks re-
quire 10y hr of woodworking. Since there is no more than 600 hr of labor
available for woodworking, we have one constraint:
.
Similarly, the bookcases and desks require 4x hr and 3y hr of finishing,
respectively. There is no more than 240 hr of labor available for finishing, so
we have a second constraint:
.
We also know that 
and 
because the carpentry shop cannot
make a negative number of either product.
Thus we want to maximize the objective function
subject to the constraints
,
,
,
.
We graph the system of inequalities and determine the vertices.
Next, we evaluate the objective function P at each vertex.
The carpentry shop will make a maximum profit of $4560 when 
24 bookcases and 48 desks are produced.

Partial Fractions
Decompose rational expressions into partial fractions.
There are situations in calculus in which it is useful to write a rational 
expression as a sum of two or more simpler rational expressions. For ex-
ample, in the equation
,
each fraction on the right side is called a partial fraction. The expression
on the right side is the partial fraction decomposition of the rational ex-
pression on the left side. In this section, we learn how such decompositions
are created.
Partial Fraction Decompositions
The procedure for finding the partial fraction decomposition of a ra-
tional expression involves factoring its denominator into linear and 
quadratic factors.

Procedure for Decomposing a Rational Expression 
into Partial Fractions
Consider any rational expression 
such that 
and 
have no common factor other than 1 or 1.
1. If the degree of
is greater than or equal to the degree 
of
, divide to express 
as a quotient
remainder
and follow steps (2)–(5) to decompose the
resulting rational expression.
2. If the degree of
is less than the degree of
, factor 
into linear factors of the form 
and/or quadratic factors
of the form 
. Any quadratic factor 
must be irreducible, meaning that it cannot be factored into 
linear factors with rational coefficients.
3. Assign to each linear factor 
the sum of n partial 
fractions:
.
4. Assign to each quadratic factor 
the sum of m
partial fractions:
.
5. Apply algebraic methods, as illustrated in the following examples,
to find the constants in the numerators of the partial fractions.
EXAMPLE 1
Decompose into partial fractions:
.
Solution
The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the 
denominator. We begin by factoring the denominator:
.
We know that there are constants A and B such that
.
To determine A and B, we add the expressions on the right:
.
Next, we equate the numerators:
.
Since the last equation containing A and B is true for all x, we can substi-
tute any value of x and still have a true equation. If we choose 
, then

If we choose 
, then

To check, we can add to see if we get the expression on the left. We can also
use the TABLE feature on a graphing calculator, comparing values of
and
for the same values of x. Since 
for the given values of x as we scroll 
through the table, the decomposition appears to be correct.
EXAMPLE 2
Decompose into partial fractions:
.
Solution
The degree of the numerator is 2 and the degree of the denomi-
nator is 3, so the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the de-
nominator. The denominator is given in factored form. The decomposition

Chapter 8 Summary and Review
Important Properties and Formulas
Row-Equivalent Operations
1. Interchange any two rows.
2. Multiply each entry in a row by the same
nonzero constant.
3. Add a nonzero multiple of one row to 
another row.
Row-Echelon Form
1. If a row does not consist entirely of 0’s, then
the first nonzero element in the row is a 1
(called a leading 1).
2. For any two successive nonzero rows, the
leading 1 in the lower row is farther to the
right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
3. All the rows consisting entirely of 0’s are at the
bottom of the matrix.
If a fourth property is also satisfied, a matrix is
said to be in reduced row-echelon form:
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has 0’s
everywhere else.

Determinant of a 
Matrix
The determinant of the matrix 
is
denoted 
and is defined as
.
Determinant of Any Square Matrix
For any square matrix A of order 
(
),
we define the determinant of A, denoted 
, as
follows. Choose any row or column. Multiply each
element in that row or column by its cofactor and
add the results. The determinant of a 
matrix
is simply the element of the matrix. The value of a
determinant will be the same, no matter which
row or column is chosen.

To Graph a Linear Inequality 
in Two Variables:
1. Replace the inequality symbol with an equals
sign and graph this related equation. If the
inequality symbol is 
or 
, draw the line
dashed. If the inequality symbol is 
or 
,
draw the line solid.
2. The graph consists of a half-plane on one side
of the line and, if the line is solid, the line as
well. To determine which half-plane to shade,
test a point not on the line in the original
inequality. If that point is a solution, shade the
half-plane containing that point. If not, shade
the opposite half-plane.
Linear Programming Procedure
To find the maximum or minimum value of a
linear objective function subject to a set of
constraints:
1. Graph the region of feasible solutions.
2. Determine the coordinates of the vertices of
the region.
3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.
The largest and smallest of those values are the
maximum and minimum values of the
function, respectively.

Procedure for Decomposing a Rational
Expression into Partial Fractions
Consider any rational expression 
such
that 
and 
have no common factor other
than 1 or 1.
1. If the degree of
is greater than or equal to
the degree of
, divide to express 
as a quotient
and follow
steps (2)–(5) to decompose the resulting
rational expression.
2. If the degree of
is less than the degree of
, factor 
into linear factors of the
form 
and/or quadratic factors of the
form 
. Any quadratic factor
must be irreducible, meaning
that it cannot be factored into linear factors
with rational coefficients.
3. Assign to each linear factor 
the sum
of n partial fractions:
.
4. Assign to each quadratic factor 
the sum of m partial
fractions:
.
5. Apply algebraic methods to find the constants
in the numerators of the partial fractions.

The Parabola
Given an equation of a parabola, complete the square, if necessary, and
then find the vertex, the focus, and the directrix and graph the parabola.
A conic section is formed when a right circular cone with two parts,
called nappes, is intersected by a plane. One of four types of curves can 
be formed: a parabola, a circle, an ellipse, or a hyperbola.
Conic sections can be defined algebraically using second-degree
equations of the form 
. In addi-
tion, they can be defined geometrically as a set of points that satisfy cer-
tain conditions.
Parabolas
In Section 2.4, we saw that the graph of the quadratic function
,
, is a parabola. A parabola can be defined 
geometrically.
Parabola
A parabola is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed
line (the directrix) and a fixed point not on the line (the focus).
The line that is perpendicular to the directrix and contains the focus is
the axis of symmetry. The vertex is the midpoint of the segment between
the focus and the directrix. (See the figure at left.)
Let’s derive the standard equation of a parabola with vertex 
and
directrix 
, where 
. We place the coordinate axes as shown in

Figure 2
Fig. 1. The y-axis is the axis of symmetry and contains the focus F. The
distance from the focus to the vertex is the same as the distance from the
vertex to the directrix. Thus the coordinates of F are 
.
Let 
be any point on the parabola and consider 
perpendicu-
lar to the line 
. The coordinates of G are 
. By the definition
of a parabola,
.
The distance from P to the focus is the same 
as the distance from P to the directrix.
Then using the distance formula, we have
Squaring both sides
and squaring the binomials
.
We have shown that if
is on the parabola shown in Fig. 1, then its
coordinates satisfy this equation. The converse is also true, but we will not
prove it here.
Note that if
, as above, the graph opens up. If
, the graph
opens down.
The equation of a parabola with vertex 
and directrix 
is derived similarly. Such a parabola opens either to the right (
), as
shown in Fig. 2, or to the left (
).
Standard Equation of a Parabola 
with Vertex at the Origin 
The standard equation of a parabola with vertex 
and directrix
is
.
The focus is

The standard equation of a parabola with vertex

Thus,
, so the focus is

EXAMPLE 2
Find an equation of the parabola with vertex 
and
focus 
. Then graph the parabola.
Solution
The focus is on the x-axis so the line of symmetry is the x-axis.
Thus the equation is of the type
.
Since the focus 
is 5 units to the right of the vertex,
and the
equation is
,
or
.
We can also use a graphing calculator to graph parabolas. It might be
necessary to solve the equation for y before entering it in the calculator:
.
We now graph

Applications
Parabolas have many applications. For example, cross sections of car
headlights, flashlights, and searchlights are parabolas. The bulb is located
at the focus and light from that point is reflected outward parallel to the
axis of symmetry. Satellite dishes and field microphones used at sporting
events often have parabolic cross sections. Incoming radio waves or

sound waves parallel to the axis are reflected into the focus. Cables hung
between structures in suspension bridges, such as the Golden Gate Bridge,
form parabolas. When a cable supports only its own weight, however, it
forms a curve called a catenary rather than a parabola.

Given an equation of a circle, complete the square, if necessary, and then
find the center and the radius and graph the circle.
Given an equation of an ellipse, complete the square, if necessary, and
then find the center, the vertices, and the foci and graph the ellipse.
Circles
We can define a circle geometrically.
Circle
A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance
from a fixed point (the center) in the plane.

The Circle and the Ellipse
773
Circles were introduced in Section 1.1. Recall the standard equation of a
circle with center 
and radius r.
Standard Equation of a Circle
The standard equation of a circle with center 
and radius r is
.
EXAMPLE 1
For the circle
,
find the center and the radius. Then graph the circle.
Solution
First, we complete the square twice:
and 
;
adding 64 and 49 on both sides to complete the
square twice on the left side
.
Writing standard form
The center is 
and the radius is 9. We graph the circle.
To use a graphing calculator to graph the circle, it might be necessary to
solve for y first. The original equation can be solved using the quadratic for-
mula, or the standard form of the equation can be solved using the principle
of square roots. The second alternative is illustrated here:
Using the 
principle of

Some graphing calculators have a DRAW feature that provides a quick
way to graph a circle when the center and the radius are known. This feature
is described on p. 69.
Ellipses
We have studied two conic sections, the parabola and the circle. Now we turn
our attention to a third, the ellipse.
Ellipse
An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane, the sum of whose
distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. The center
of an ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between the foci.
We can draw an ellipse by first placing two thumbtacks in a piece of
cardboard. These are the foci (singular, focus). We then attach a piece of
string to the tacks. Its length is the constant sum of the distances 
from the foci to any point on the ellipse. Next, we trace a curve with a pen
held tight against the string. The figure traced is an ellipse.
Let’s first consider the ellipse shown at the top of the next page with
center at the origin. The points 
and 
are the foci. The segment 
is
the major axis, and the points 
and A are the vertices. The segment B	B

Study Tip
If you are finding it difficult to
master a particular topic or
concept, talk about it with a
classmate. Verbalizing your
questions about the material
might help clarify it for you. If your
classmate is also finding the
material difficult, it is possible that
the majority of the students in
your class are confused, and you
can ask your instructor to explain
the concept again.

EXAMPLE 3
For the ellipse
,
find the vertices and the foci. Then draw the graph.
Solution
We first find standard form:
.
Writing  standard form
Thus,
and 
. The major axis is vertical, so the vertices 
are 
and 
. Since we know that 
, we have 
, so 
and the foci are 
and 
.
To graph the ellipse, we plot the vertices. Note also that since 
,
the x-intercepts are 
and 
. We plot these points as well and
connect the four points we have plotted with a smooth curve.
If the center of an ellipse is not at the origin but at some point 
,
then we can think of an ellipse with center at the origin being translated
horizontally 
units and vertically 
units.

EXAMPLE 4
For the ellipse
,
find the center, the vertices, and the foci. Then draw the graph.
Solution
First, we complete the square twice to get standard form:
Completing the square twice by
adding 
and 1 on both sides
.
Writing standard form:
The center is 
. Note that 
and 
. The major axis is verti-
cal, so the vertices are 4 units above and below the center:
and 
,
or
and 
.
We know that 
, so 
and 
, or 
.
Then the foci are 
units above and below the center:
and
.
To graph the ellipse, we plot the vertices. Note also that since 
, two
other points on the graph are the endpoints of the minor axis, 2 units right
and left of the center:
and
,
or
and
.
We plot these points as well and connect the four points with a smooth curve.

Applications
One exciting application of an ellipse is a medical device called a lithotripter.
This machine uses underwater shock waves to pulverize kidney stones. The
waves originate at one focus of an ellipse and are reflected to the kidney
stone, which is positioned at the other focus. Recovery time following the use
of this technique is much shorter than with conventional surgery and the
mortality rate is far lower.
A room with an ellipsoidal ceiling is known as a whispering gallery. In
such a room, a word whispered at one focus can be clearly heard at the other.
Whispering galleries are found in the rotunda of the Capitol Building in
Washington, D.C., and in the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City.
Ellipses have many other applications. Planets travel around the sun in
elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus, for example, and satellites travel
around the earth in elliptical orbits as well.

The Hyperbola
Given an equation of a hyperbola, complete the square, if necessary, and
then find the center, the vertices, and the foci and graph the hyperbola.
The last type of conic section that we will study is the hyperbola.
Hyperbola
A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane for which the 
absolute value of the difference of the distances from two fixed 
points (the foci) is constant. The midpoint of the segment 
between the foci is the center of the hyperbola.
Standard Equations of Hyperbolas
We first consider the equation of a hyperbola with center at the origin. In
the figure below,
and 
are the foci. The segment 
is the trans-
verse axis and the points 
and 
are the vertices.

To graph a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis, it is helpful 
to begin by graphing the lines

. These are the
asymptotes of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola with a vertical transverse
axis, the asymptotes are

EXAMPLE 1
Find an equation of the hyperbola with vertices 
and 
and foci 
and 
.
Solution
We know that 
and 
. We find 
:
.
Since the vertices and the foci are on the y-axis, we know that the trans-
verse axis is vertical. We can now write the equation of the hyperbola:
.
EXAMPLE 2
For the hyperbola given by
,
find the vertices, the foci, and the asymptotes. Then graph the hyperbola.
Solution
First, we find standard form:
.
Writing standard form
The hyperbola has a horizontal transverse axis, so the vertices are 
and 
, or 
and 
. From the standard form of the equation,
we know that 
, or 16, and 
, or 9. We find the foci:
.
Thus the foci are 
and 
.
Next, we find the asymptotes:
and
.

To draw the graph, we sketch the asymptotes first. This is easily done
by drawing the rectangle with horizontal sides passing through 
and 
and vertical sides through 
and 
. Then we draw
and extend the diagonals of this rectangle. The two extended diagonals 
are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. Next, we plot the vertices and draw
the branches of the hyperbola outward from the vertices toward the 
asymptotes.
To graph this hyperbola on a graphing calculator, it might be necessary
to solve for y first and then graph the top and bottom halves of the hyper-
bola in the same squared viewing window.

Applications
Some comets travel in hyperbolic paths with the sun at one focus. Such
comets pass by the sun only one time, unlike those with elliptical orbits,
which reappear at intervals. A cross section of an amphitheater might be
one branch of a hyperbola. A cross section of a nuclear cooling tower
might also be a hyperbola.
One other application of hyperbolas is in the long-range navigation
system LORAN. This system uses transmitting stations in three locations
to send out simultaneous signals to a ship or aircraft. The difference in the
arrival times of the signals from one pair of transmitters is recorded on the
ship or aircraft. This difference is also recorded for signals from another
pair of transmitters. For each pair, a computation is performed to deter-
mine the difference in the distances from each member of the pair to the
ship or aircraft. If each pair of differences is kept constant, two hyperbolas
can be drawn. Each has one of the pairs of transmitters as foci, and the ship
or aircraft lies on the intersection of two of their branches.

parallel to the shoreline. The signal from 
transmitter S reaches the ship 200 microseconds
later than the signal from transmitter T. The signals
travel at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, or
0.186 mile per microsecond. Find the equation of
the hyperbola with foci S and T on which the ship is
located. (Hint: For any point on the hyperbola, the
absolute value of the difference of its distances from

Nonlinear
Systems of
Equations and
Inequalities
Solve a nonlinear system of equations.
Use nonlinear systems of equations to solve applied problems.
Graph nonlinear systems of inequalities.
The systems of equations that we have studied so far have been composed of
linear equations. Now we consider systems of two equations in two variables
in which at least one equation is not linear.
Nonlinear Systems of Equations
The graphs of the equations in a nonlinear system of equations can have no
point of intersection or one or more points of intersection. The coordinates
of each point of intersection represent a solution of the system of equations.
When no point of intersection exists, the system of equations has no real-
number solution.
Solutions of nonlinear systems of equations can be found using the
substitution or elimination method. The substitution method is prefer-
able for a system consisting of one linear and one nonlinear equation. The
elimination method is preferable in most, but not all, cases when both
equations are nonlinear.

Nonlinear Systems of Inequalities
Recall that a solution of a system of inequalities is an ordered pair that is a
solution of each inequality in the system. We graphed systems of linear in-
equalities in Section 8.7. Now we graph a nonlinear system of inequalities.
EXAMPLE 6
Graph the solution set of the system
Solution
We graph 
by first graphing the equation of the
circle 
We use a solid line since the inequality symbol is 
Next we choose 
as a test point and find that it is a solution of
so we shade the region that contains 
using red. This is
the region inside the circle. Now we graph the line 
using a
dashed line since the inequality symbol is 
The point 
is on the line,
so we choose another test point, say 
We find that this point is not a so-
lution of
so we shade the half-plane that does not contain
using green. The solution set of the inequality is the region shaded
both red and green, or brown, including part of the circle x2  y2  25.

Use rotation of axes to graph conic sections.
Use the discriminant to determine the type of conic represented by a
given equation.
In Section 9.1, we saw that conic sections can be defined algebraically 
using a second-degree equation of the form 
. Up to this point, we have considered only equations of this
form for which 
. Now we turn our attention to equations of conics
that contain an xy-term.
Rotation of Axes
When B is nonzero, the graph of
is
a conic section with an axis that is not parallel to the x- or y-axis. We use a
technique called rotation of axes when we graph such an equation. The goal
is to rotate the x- and y-axes through a positive angle 
to yield an 
-
coordinate system, as shown at left. For the appropriate choice of
, the
graph of any conic section with an xy-term will have its axis parallel to the
-axis or the 
-axis.
Algebraically we want to rewrite an equation
in the xy-coordinate system in the form
in the 
-coordinate system. Equations of this second type were graphed in
Sections 9.1–9.3.
To achieve our goal, we find formulas relating the xy-coordinates of a
point and the 
-coordinates of the same point. We begin by letting P be a
point with coordinates 
in the xy-coordinate system and 
in the
-coordinate system.
We let r represent the distance OP, and we let 
represent the angle from
the x-axis to OP. Then

EXAMPLE 1
Suppose that the xy-axes are rotated through an angle of 45°.
Write the equation 
in the 
-coordinate system.
Solution
We substitute 45° for 
in the rotation of axes formulas for x
and y:
Then we have
and
Next, we substitute these expressions for x and y in the equation 
or
We have the equation of a hyperbola in the 
-coordinate system 
with its axis on the 
-axis and with vertices 
and 
Its 
asymptotes are 
and 
These correspond to the axes of the
xy-coordinate system.
Now let’s substitute the rotation of axes formulas for x and y in the 
equation

Study Tip
If you are finding it difficult to
master a particular topic or
concept, talk about it with a
classmate. Verbalizing your
questions about the material
might help clarify it for you. If your
classmate is also finding the
material difficult, it is possible that
the majority of the students in
your class are confused and you
can ask your instructor to explain
the concept again.

The Discriminant
It is possible to determine the type of conic represented by the equation
before rotating the axes. Using the
expressions for 
and 
in terms of A, B, C, and developed earlier, it
can be shown that
Now when is chosen so that
rotation of axes gives us an equation
If
and 
have the same sign, or 
then the graph of this equa-
tion is an ellipse or a circle. If
and 
have different signs, or 
then the graph is a hyperbola. And, if either 
or 
or 
the graph is a parabola.
Since 
and 
it follows that 
Then the graph is an ellipse or a circle if
a hyperbola if
or a parabola if
(There are
certain special cases, called degenerate conics, where these statements do 
not hold, but we will not concern ourselves with these here.) The expression
is the discriminant of the equation 
The graph of the equation

1. an ellipse or a circle if
2. a hyperbola if
and

In Sections 9.1–9.3, we saw that the parabola, the ellipse, and the hyperbola
have different definitions in rectangular coordinates. When polar coordi-
nates are used, we can give a single definition that applies to all three conics.
An Alternate Definition of Conics
Let L be a fixed line (the directrix); let F be a fixed point (the focus),
not on L; and let e be a positive constant (the eccentricity). A conic
is the set of all points P in the plane such that

Polar Equations of Conics
To derive equations for the conics in polar coordinates, we position the focus
F at the pole and position the directrix L either perpendicular to the polar
axis or parallel to it. In the figure below, we place L perpendicular to the
polar axis and p units to the right of the focus, or pole.
Note that 
Then if P is any point on the conic, we have
Thus we see that the polar equation of a conic with focus at the pole 
and directrix perpendicular to the polar axis and p units to the right of the
pole is
where e is the eccentricity of the conic.
For an ellipse and a hyperbola, we can make the following statement 
regarding eccentricity.
For an ellipse and a hyperbola, the eccentricity e is given by
where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a is the distance
from the center to a vertex.

We begin by dividing the numerator and the denominator by 6
to obtain a constant term of 1 in the denominator:
This equation is in the form

Since 
the graph is an ellipse. Also, since 
and 
we have 
Thus the ellipse has a vertical directrix
that lies 6 units to the right of the pole. We graph the equation in the square

They are

The center of the ellipse is at the midpoint of the segment connecting the
vertices, or at

Using the equation

Finally, using

Solution
The equation of the directrix can be written

This is a quadratic equation. Hence its graph is a parabola. Thus the curve

ding rectangular equation, we say that we eliminate the parameter.

Solution

This appears to be the graph of an ellipse. To find the rectangular equation,
we first solve for 
and 
in the parametric equations:
,
.
Using the identity 
we can substitute to eliminate the
parameter:
Substituting
Ellipse
The rectangular form of the equation confirms that the graph is an ellipse 
centered at the origin with vertices at 
and 
Determining Parametric Equations 
for a Given Rectangular Equation
Many sets of parametric equations can represent the same plane curve.
In fact, there are infinitely many such equations.

Applications
The motion of an object that is propelled upward can be described with
parametric equations. Such motion is called projectile motion. It can be
shown using more advanced mathematics that, neglecting air resistance,
the following equations describe the path of a projectile propelled up-
ward at an angle 
with the horizontal from a height h, in feet, at an 
initial speed 
, in feet per second:

d) The ball hits the ground when 
. Thus, in order to determine 
how long the ball is in the air, we solve the equation 
:
Standard form
Using the quadratic formula
.
The negative value for t has no meaning in this application. Thus we
determine that the ball is in the air for about 4.5 sec.
e) Since the ball is in the air for about 4.5 sec, the horizontal distance 
that it travels is given by
ft.
f) To find the maximum height of the ball, we find the maximum value
of y. This occurs at the vertex of the quadratic function represented by
y. At the vertex, we have

The path of a fixed point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls
along a line is called a cycloid. For example, a point on the rim of a bi-
cycle wheel traces a cycloid curve.
The parametric equations of a cycloid are
,
,
where a is the radius of the circle that traces the curve and t is in radian
measure.

Sequences, Series, and Combinatorics
10.1
Sequences and
Series
Find terms of sequences given the nth term.
Look for a pattern in a sequence and try to determine a general term.
Convert between sigma notation and other notation for a series.
Construct the terms of a recursively defined sequence.
In this section, we discuss sets or lists of numbers, considered in order,
and their sums.
Sequences
Suppose that $1000 is invested at 6%, compounded annually. The amounts
to which the account will grow after 1 yr, 2 yr, 3 yr, 4 yr, and so on, form the
following sequence of numbers:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
$1060.00,
$1123.60,
$1191.02,
We can think of this as a function that pairs 1 with $1060.00, 2 with
$1123.60, 3 with $1191.02, and so on. A sequence is thus a function,
where the domain is a set of consecutive positive integers beginning 
with 1.
If we continue to compute the amounts of money in the account for-
ever, we obtain an infinite sequence with function values
The dots “
” at the end indicate that the sequence goes on without stop-
ping. If we stop after a certain number of years, we obtain a finite 
sequence:
.
Sequences
An infinite sequence is a function having for its domain the set
of positive integers,
.
A finite sequence is a function having for its domain a set of
positive integers,
, for some positive integer n.
Consider the sequence given by the formula

The first term of the sequence is denoted as 
, the fifth term as

and the nth term, or general term, as 
. This sequence can also be de-
noted as

EXAMPLE 1
Find the first 4 terms and the 23rd term of the sequence
whose general term is given by

Solution
We have

We can also use a graphing calculator to find the desired terms of this 
sequence. We enter 
. We then set up a table in ASK mode and
enter 1, 2, 3, 4, and 23 as values for x.
Note in Example 1 that the power 
causes the signs of the terms
to alternate between positive and negative, depending on whether n is
even or odd. This kind of sequence is called an alternating sequence.
EXAMPLE 2
Use a graphing calculator to find the first 5 terms of the se-
quence whose general term is given by 
Solution
We can use a table or the SEQ feature, as shown here. We select
SEQ from the LIST OPS menu and enter the general term, the variable, and
the numbers of the first and last terms desired. The calculator will write the
terms horizontally as a list. The list can also be written in fraction notation.
We use the 
key to view the two items that do not initially appear

We can graph a sequence just as we graph other functions. Consider
the function given by 
and the sequence whose general term
is given by 
. The graph of
is shown on the left
below. Since the domain of a sequence is a set of positive integers, the graph
of a sequence is a set of points that are not connected. Thus if we remove all
the points from the graph of
except those whose first coordi-
nates are positive integers, we have the graph of the sequence
as shown on the right below.
We can also use a graphing calculator to graph a sequence. Since we 
are graphing a set of unconnected points, we use DOT mode. We also select
SEQUENCE mode. In this mode, the variable is n and functions are named
,
, and 
rather than 
and 
EXAMPLE 3
Use a graphing calculator to graph the sequence whose gen-
eral term is given by 
Solution
With the calculator set in DOT and SEQUENCE modes, we enter
All the function values will be positive numbers that are
less than 1, so we choose the window 
and we also choose
and 
Finding the General Term
When only the first few terms of a sequence are known, we do not know
for sure what the general term is, but we might be able to make a predic-
tion by looking for a pattern.

EXAMPLE 4
For each of the following sequences, predict the general
term.
a) 1,
,
,
b) 1, 3, 9, 27,
c) 2, 4,
Solution
a) These are square roots of consecutive integers, so the general term might
be 
.
b) These are powers of 3 with alternating signs, so the general term might
be 
.
c) If we see the pattern of powers of 2, we will see 16 as the next term and
guess 
for the general term. Then the sequence could be written 
with more terms as
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
If we see that we can get the second term by adding 2, the third term by
adding 4, and the next term by adding 6, and so on, we will see 14 as the
next term. A general term for the sequence is 
, and the se-
quence can be written with more terms as
2, 4, 8, 14, 22, 32, 44,
Example 4(c) illustrates that, in fact, you can never be certain about
the general term when only a few terms are given. The fewer the given
terms, the greater the uncertainty.
Sums and Series
Series
Given the infinite sequence
,
,
,
,
,
the sum of the terms
is called an infinite series. A partial sum is the sum of the first 
n terms:
.
A partial sum is also called a finite series, or nth partial sum, and is
denoted 
.

EXAMPLE 5
For the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
, find each
of the following.
a)
b)
c)
Solution
a)
b)
c)
We can also use a graphing calculator to find partial sums of a sequence
when a formula for the general term is known.
EXAMPLE 6
Use a graphing calculator to find 
,
,
, and 
for the se-
quence whose general term is given by 
Solution
We can use the CUMSUM feature from the LIST OPS menu. The 
calculator will write the partial sums as a list. (Note that the calculator can be set
in either FUNCTION mode or SEQUENCE mode. Here we show SEQUENCE
mode.)
We have 
,
,
, and 
.
Sigma Notation
The Greek letter 
(sigma) can be used to denote a sum when the general
term of a sequence is a formula. For example, the sum of the first four
terms of the sequence 3, 5, 7,
,
can be named as follows,
using what is called sigma notation, or summation notation:
.
This is read “the sum as k goes from 1 to 4 of
.” The letter k is called
the index of summation. The index of summation might start at a number
other than 1, and letters other than k can be used.
EXAMPLE 7
Find and evaluate each of the following sums.
a)
b)
c)
Solution
a) We replace k with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Then we add the results.

We can also combine the SUM and SEQ features on a graphing calculator to
add the terms of this sequence.

EXAMPLE 8
Write sigma notation for each sum.
a)
b)
c)
Solution
a)
This is the sum of powers of 2, beginning with 
, or 1, and ending with
, or 64. Sigma notation is 
.
b)
Disregarding the alternating signs, we see that this is the sum of the first
5 even integers. Note that 2k is a formula for the kth positive even inte-
ger, and 
when k is odd and 
when k is even. Thus
the general term is 
. The sum begins with 
and ends with
, so sigma notation is 
.
c)
The general term is 
, beginning with 
. This is also an infi-
nite series. We use the symbol 
for infinity and write the series using
sigma notation:
.
Recursive Definitions
A sequence may be defined recursively or by using a recursion formula.
Such a definition lists the first term, or the first few terms, and then describes
how to determine the remaining terms from the given terms.

One of the most famous recursively defined

Italian mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, also called
Fibonacci, proposed the following model for rabbit
population growth. Suppose that every  month each
mature pair of rabbits in the population produces a
new pair that begins reproducing after two months,
and also suppose that no rabbits die. Beginning with
one pair of newborn rabbits, the population can be
modeled by the following recursively defined
sequence:

is the total number of pairs of rabbits in
month n. Find the first 7 terms of the Fibonacci
sequence.

Arithmetic
Sequences 
and Series
For any arithmetic sequence, find the nth term when n is given and n
when the nth term is given, and given two terms, find the common
difference and construct the sequence.
Find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence.
A sequence in which each term after the first is found by adding the 
same number to the preceding term is an arithmetic sequence.
Arithmetic Sequences
The sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14,
is arithmetic because adding 3 to any
term produces the next term. In other words, the difference between any
term and the preceding one is 3. Arithmetic sequences are also called
arithmetic progressions.
Arithmetic Sequence
A sequence is arithmetic if there exists a number d, called the
common difference, such that 
for any integer 
.
EXAMPLE 1
For each of the following arithmetic sequences, identify the
first term,
, and the common difference, d.
a) 4, 9, 14, 19,
b) 34, 27, 20, 13, 6, 1,
c) 2,
, 3,
, 4,
Solution
The first term,
, is the first term listed. To find the common
difference, d, we choose any term beyond the first and subtract the pre-
ceding term from it.

We obtained the common difference by subtracting

we subtracted

values for d. Thus we can check by adding d to each term in a sequence to
see if we progress correctly to the next term.

To find a formula for the general, or nth, term of any arithmetic se-
quence, we denote the common difference by d, write out the first few
terms, and look for a pattern:
,

Substituting for 
Note that the coefficient of
d in each case is 1 less than 
the subscript.
Generalizing, we obtain the following formula.
nth Term of an Arithmetic Sequence
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by

, 4 for 
, and 3 for d in the formula for
the nth term and solve for n:
Substituting

Study Tip
The best way to prepare for a final
exam is to do so over a period of at
least two weeks. First review each
chapter, studying the formulas,
theorems, properties, and
procedures in the sections and 
in the Chapter Summary and
Review. Then take each of the
Chapter Tests again. If you miss
any questions, spend extra time
reviewing the corresponding
topics. Watch the videotapes 
that accompany the text or use the
InterAct Math Tutorial Software.
Also consider participating in a
study group or attending a
tutoring or review session.

Given two terms and their places in an arithmetic sequence, we can
construct the sequence.
EXAMPLE 4
The 3rd term of an arithmetic sequence is 8, and the 16th
term is 47. Find 
and d and construct the sequence.
Solution
We know that 
and 
. Thus we would have to add
d 13 times to get from 8 to 47. That is,
.
and 
are 
, or 13, terms apart.
Solving 
, we obtain
.
Since 
, we subtract d twice to get 
. Thus,
.
and 
are 
, or 2, terms apart.
The sequence is 2, 5, 8,
Note that we could also subtract d
15 times from 
in order to find 
.
In general, d should be subtracted 
times from 
in order to
find 
.
EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Graph the first 10 terms of each arith-
metic sequence. What pattern do you observe?
The pattern shown above holds in general. The graph of an arithmetic se-
quence is a set of points that lie on the graph of a linear function.

Sum of the First n Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence
Consider the arithmetic sequence
3, 5, 7,
When we add the first 4 terms of the sequence, we get 
, which is
,
or
24.
This sum is called an arithmetic series. To find a formula for the sum 
of the first n terms,
, of an arithmetic sequence, we first denote an 
arithmetic sequence, as follows:
,
,
,
,
.
Then 
is given by
.
(1)
Reversing the order of the addition gives us
.
(2)
If we add corresponding terms of each side of equations (1) and (2),
we get
.
In the expression for 
, there are n expressions in square brackets.
Each of these expressions is equivalent to 
. Thus the expression for
can be written in simplified form as
.
Since 
is being added n times, it follows that
,
from which we get the following formula.

, and 
. Before using the 
formula
,
we find the last term,
:
Substituting into the formula

EXAMPLE 7
Find the sum:
.
Solution
It is helpful to first write out a few terms:
.
It appears that this is an arithmetic series coming from an arithmetic se-
quence with 
,
, and 
. Before using the formula
,
we find the last term,
:
The kth term is 
.
.
Thus,
Substituting into 
.
This sum can also be found on a graphing calculator. It is not necessary
to have the calculator set in SEQUENCE mode to do this.
Applications
The translation of some applications and problem-solving situations may
involve arithmetic sequences or series. We consider some examples.
EXAMPLE 8
Hourly Wages.
Gloria accepts a job, starting with an
hourly wage of $14.25, and is promised a raise of 15¢ per hour every 
2 months for 5 yr. At the end of 5 yr, what will Gloria’s hourly wage be?
Solution
It helps to first write down the hourly wage for several 2-month
time periods:
Beginning:
$14.25,
After 2 months:
$14.40,
After 4 months:
$14.55,
and so on.
What appears is a sequence of numbers: 14.25, 14.40,
This 
sequence is arithmetic, because adding 0.15 each time gives us the 
next term.

We want to find the last term of an arithmetic sequence, so we use 
the formula 
. We know that 
and 
,
but what is n? That is, how many terms are in the sequence? Each year
there are 
, or 6 raises, since Gloria gets a raise every 2 months. There
are 5 yr, so the total number of raises will be 
, or 30. Thus there will
be 31 terms: the original wage and 30 increased rates.
Substituting in the formula 
gives us
.
Thus, at the end of 5 yr, Gloria’s hourly wage will be $18.75.
The calculations in Example 8 could be done in a number of ways.
There is often a variety of ways in which a problem can be solved. In this
chapter, we concentrate on the use of sequences and series and their 
related formulas.
EXAMPLE 9
Total in a Stack.
A stack of telephone poles has 30 poles
in the bottom row. There are 29 poles in the second row, 28 in the next
row, and so on. How many poles are in the stack if there are 5 poles in the
top row?
Solution
A picture will help in this case. The following figure shows the
ends of the poles and the way in which they stack.
Since the number of poles goes from 30 in a row up to 5 in the top
row, there must be 26 rows. We want the sum
.
Thus we have an arithmetic series. We use the formula
,
with 
,
, and 
.
Substituting, we get
.
There are 455 poles in the stack.

Geometric
Sequences 
and Series
Identify the common ratio of a geometric sequence, and find a given
term and the sum of the first n terms.
Find the sum of an infinite geometric series, if it exists.
A sequence in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the
preceding term by the same number is a geometric sequence.
Geometric Sequences
Consider the sequence:
2, 6, 18, 54,
Note that multiplying each term by 3 produces the next term. We call 
the number 3 the common ratio because it can be found by dividing 
any term by the preceding term. A geometric sequence is also called a 
geometric progression.
Geometric Sequence
A sequence is geometric if there is a number r, called the common
ratio, such that

nth Term of a Geometric Sequence
The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by

Solution
We first note that

.
To find the common ratio, we can divide any term (other than the first)
by the preceding term. Since the second term is 20 and the first is 4,
we get
,
or

EXPLORING WITH TECHNOLOGY
Graph the first 7 terms of each geomet-
ric sequence. What pattern do you observe?
,
,
,
The pattern shown above holds in general. The graph of a geometric 
sequence is a set of points that lie on the graph of an exponential function.
Sum of the First n Terms of a Geometric Sequence
Next, we develop a formula for the sum 
of the first n terms of a geo-
metric sequence:
,
,
,
,
The associated geometric series is given by
.
(1)
We want to find a formula for this sum. If we multiply on both sides of
equation (1) by r, we have
.
(2)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we see that the differences of
the red terms are 0, leaving
,
or
.
Factoring
Dividing on both sides by

We examine some partial sums. Note that each of the partial sums is less
than 1, but 
gets very close to 1 as n gets large.
We say that 1 is the limit of

nite geometric sequence. The sum of an infinite geometric sequence is

Some infinite sequences do not have sums. Consider the infinite 
geometric series

We again examine some partial sums. Note that as n gets large,

large without bound. This sequence does not have a sum.
It can be shown (but we will not do so here) that the sum of the 
terms of an infinite geometric series exists if and only if

the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1).

amount in the account at the end of 5 yr is called the amount of the 
annuity. Find that amount.

The Economic Multiplier.
The finals of the NCAA men’s
basketball tournament have a significant effect on the economy of the
host city. Suppose that 45,000 people visit the city and spend $600 each
while there. Then assume that 80% of that money is spent again in the
city, and then 80% of that money is spent again, and so on. This is 
known as the economic multiplier effect. Find the total effect on the 
economy.
Solution
The initial effect is 
, or $27,000,000. The total ef-
fect is given by the infinite series
.
Since 
, the series has a sum. Using the formula for
the sum of an infinite geometric series, we have
.
Thus the total effect on the economy of the spending from the tourna-
ment is $135,000,000.

List the statements of an infinite sequence that is defined by a formula.
Do proofs by mathematical induction.
In this section we learn to prove a sequence of mathematical statements
using a procedure called mathematical induction.
Sequences of Statements
Infinite sequences of statements occur often in mathematics. In an infi-
nite sequence of statements, there is a statement for each natural number.
For example, consider the sequence of statements represented by the 
following:
“For each x between 0 and 1,
.”
Let’s think of this as 
, or 
. Substituting natural numbers for n gives a
sequence of statements. We list a few of them.
Statement 1,
:
For x between 0 and 1,
.
Statement 2,
:
For x between 0 and 1,
.
Statement 3,
:
For x between 0 and 1,
.
Statement 4,
:
For x between 0 and 1,
.
In this context, the symbols 
,
,
, and so on, do not represent sums.
EXAMPLE 1
List the first four statements in the sequence that can be
obtained from each of the following.

Mathematical Induction

Proving Infinite Sequences of Statements
We now develop a method of proof, called mathematical induction,
which we can use to try to prove that all statements in an infinite se-
quence of statements are true. The statements usually have the form:
“For all natural numbers n,
”,
where 
is some mathematical sentence such as those of the preceding
examples. Of course, we cannot prove each statement of an infinite se-
quence individually. Instead, we try to show that “whenever 
holds,
then 
must hold.” We abbreviate this as 
. (This is also read
“If
, then
,” or “
implies
.”) Suppose that we could somehow 
establish that this holds for all natural numbers k. Then we would have 
the following:
meaning “if
is true, then 
is true”;
meaning “if
is true, then 
is true”;
meaning “if
is true, then 
is true”;
and so on, indefinitely.
Even knowing that 
, we would still not be certain whether there
is any k for which 
is true. All we would know is that “if
is true, then
is true.” Suppose now that 
is true for some k, say,
. We then
must have the following.
is true.
We have verified, or proved, this.
This means that whenever 
is true,
is true.
Therefore,
is true.
This means that whenever 
is true,
is true.
Therefore,
is true.
and so on.
We conclude that 
is true for all natural numbers n.
This leads us to the principle of mathematical induction, which we use
to prove the types of statements considered here.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction
We can prove an infinite sequence of statements 
by showing 
the following.

Mathematical induction is analogous to lining up a sequence of
dominoes. The induction step tells us that if any one domino is knocked
over, then the one next to it will be hit and knocked over. The basis step
tells us that the first domino can indeed be knocked over. Note that in
order for all dominoes to fall, both conditions must be satisfied.
When you are learning to do proofs by mathematical induction, it is
helpful to first write out 
,
,
, and 
. This helps to identify
what is to be assumed and what is to be deduced.

Sequences, Series, and Combinatorics
Evaluate factorial and permutation notation and solve related 
applied problems.
In order to study probability, it is first necessary to learn about combi-
natorics, the theory of counting.
Permutations
In this section, we will consider the part of combinatorics called 
permutations.
The study of permutations involves order and arrangements.
EXAMPLE 1
How many 3-letter code symbols can be formed with the
letters A, B, C without repetition (that is, using each letter only once)?
Solution
Consider placing the letters in these boxes.
We can select any of the 3 letters for the first letter in the symbol.
Once this letter has been selected, the second must be selected from the 
2 remaining letters. After this, the third letter is already determined, since
only 1 possibility is left. That is, we can place any of the 3 letters in the

We see that there are 6 possibilities. The set of all the possibilities is
.
Suppose that we perform an experiment such as selecting letters (as
in the preceding example), flipping a coin, or drawing a card. The results
are called outcomes. An event is a set of outcomes. The following prin-
ciple pertains to the counting of actions that occur together, or are com-
bined to form an event.
The Fundamental Counting Principle
Given a combined action, or event, in which the first action can 
be performed in 
ways, the second action can be performed in 
ways, and so on, the total number of ways in which the 
combined action can be performed is the product
.
Thus, in Example 1, there are 3 choices for the first letter, 2 for the
second letter, and 1 for the third letter, making a total of
, or 
6 possibilities.
EXAMPLE 2
How many 3-letter code symbols can be formed with the
letters A, B, C, D, and E with repetition (that is, allowing letters to be 
repeated)?
Solution
Since repetition is allowed, there are 5 choices for the first let-
ter, 5 choices for the second, and 5 for the third. Thus, by the fundamen-
tal counting principle, there are 
, or 125 code symbols.
Permutation
A permutation of a set of n objects is an ordered arrangement of
all n objects.

Consider, for example, a set of 4 objects
.
To find the number of ordered arrangements of the set, we select a first
letter: There are 4 choices. Then we select a second letter: There are 
3 choices. Then we select a third letter: There are 2 choices. Finally, there
is 1 choice for the last selection. Thus, by the fundamental counting 
principle, there are 
, or 24, permutations of a set of 4 objects.
We can find a formula for the total number of permutations of all 
objects in a set of n objects. We have n choices for the first selection,
choices for the second,
for the third, and so on. For the nth
selection, there is only 1 choice.

How many ordered arrangements can be formed using 3 objects without

arrangement of k objects taken from the set.
Consider a set of n objects and the selection of an ordered arrange-

there would remain

EXAMPLE 7
Flags of Nations.
The flags of many nations consist of
three vertical stripes. For example, the flag of Ireland, shown here, has 
its first stripe green, second white, and third orange.
Suppose that the following 9 colors are available:
.
How many different flags of 3 colors can be made without repetition of
colors in a flag? This assumes that the order in which the stripes appear is
considered.
Solution
We are determining the number of permutations of 9 objects
taken 3 at a time. There is no repetition of colors. Using form (1), we get
.
EXAMPLE 8
Batting Orders.
A baseball manager arranges the batting
order as follows: The 4 infielders will bat first. Then the 3 outfielders, the
catcher, and the pitcher will follow, not necessarily in that order. How
many different batting orders are possible?
Solution
The infielders can bat in 
different ways, the rest in 
dif-
ferent ways. Then by the fundamental counting principle, we have
,
or
2880 possible batting orders.
If we allow repetition, a situation like the following can occur.
EXAMPLE 9
How many 5-letter code symbols can be formed with the
letters A, B, C, and D if we allow a letter to occur more than once?
Solution
We can select each of the 5 letters in 4 ways. That is, we can se-
lect the first letter in 4 ways, the second in 4 ways, and so on. Thus there
are 
, or 1024 arrangements.
The number of distinct arrangements of n objects taken k at a time,
allowing repetition, is 
.
Permutations of Sets with 
Nondistinguishable Objects
Consider a set of 7 marbles, 4 of which are blue and 3 of which are red.
Although the marbles are all different, when they are lined up, one red
marble will look just like any other red marble. In this sense, we say 
that the red marbles are nondistinguishable and, similarly, the blue mar-
bles are nondistinguishable.

We know that there are 7! permutations of this set. Many of them 
will look alike, however. We develop a formula for finding the number of
distinguishable permutations.
Consider a set of n objects in which 
are of one kind,
are of a 
second  kind,
are of a kth kind. The total number of permuta-
tions of the set is n!, but this includes many that are nondistinguishable.
Let N be the total number of distinguishable permutations. For each of
these N permutations, there are 
actual, nondistinguishable permuta-
tions, obtained by permuting the objects of the first kind. For each of
these 
permutations, there are 
nondistinguishable permuta-
tions, obtained by permuting the objects of the second kind, and so on.
By the fundamental counting principle, the total number of permuta-
tions, including those that are nondistinguishable, is
.
Then we have 
. Solving for N, we obtain
.
Now, to finish our problem with the marbles, we have
,
or
35
distinguishable permutations of the marbles.
In general:
For a set of n objects in which 
are of one kind,
are of another
kind,
are of a kth kind, the number of distinguishable
permutations is
.
EXAMPLE 10
In how many distinguishable ways can the letters of the
word CINCINNATI be arranged?
Solution
There are 2 C’s, 3 I’s, 3 N’s, 1 A, and 1 T for a total of 10 letters.
Thus,
,
or
50,400.
The letters of the word CINCINNATI can be arranged in 50,400 distin-
guishable ways.

Evaluate combination notation and solve related applied problems.
We now consider counting techniques in which order is not considered.
Combinations
We sometimes make a selection from a set without regard to order. Such 
a selection is called a combination. If you play cards, for example, you
know that in most situations the order in which you hold cards is not im-
portant. That is,
Each hand contains the same combination of three cards.
EXAMPLE 1
Find all the combinations of 3 letters taken from the set of
5 letters 
.
Solution
The combinations are
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
.
There are 10 combinations of the 5 letters taken 3 at a time.
When we find all the combinations from a set of 5 objects taken 3 at
a time, we are finding all the 3-element subsets. When a set is named,
the order of the elements is not considered. Thus,
names the same set as
.

Subset
Set A is a subset of set B, denoted 
, if every element of A is an
element of B.
The elements of a subset are not ordered. When thinking of combi-
nations, do not think about order!
Combination
A combination containing k objects is a subset containing 
k objects.
We want to develop a formula for computing the number of combi-
nations of n objects taken k at a time without actually listing the combi-
nations or subsets.
Combination Notation
The number of combinations of n objects taken k at a time is
denoted 
.
We call 
combination notation. We want to derive a general for-
mula for

, because a set 
with n objects has only 1 subset with n objects, the set itself. Second,
, because a set with n objects has n subsets with 1 element each.
Finally,
, because a set with n objects has only one subset with 
0 elements, namely, the empty set 
. To consider other possibilities, let’s 
return to Example 1 and compare the number of combinations with the
number of permutations.

Note that

.
This says that the number of 5-element subsets of a set of 7 objects is the
same as the number of 2-element subsets of a set of 7 objects. When 5 ele-
ments are chosen from a set, one also chooses not to include 2 elements.
To see this, consider the set 
:
In general, we have the following. This result provides an alternative way
to compute combinations.
Subsets of Size k and of Size 
and
The number of subsets of size k of a set with n objects is the same as
the number of subsets of size 
. The number of combinations of
n objects taken k at a time is the same as the number of combinations
of n objects taken 
at a time.
We now solve problems involving combinations.

number of combinations is
.
b) First we find the number of minutes in 4 days:

Thus you could buy

PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS
PERMUTATIONS
Permutations involve order and arrangements of
objects.
Given 5 books, we can arrange 3 of them on a shelf
in 
, or 60 ways.
Placing the books in different orders produces
different arrangements.
COMBINATIONS
Combinations do not involve order or
arrangements of objects.
Given 5 books, we can select 3 of them in 
, or
10 ways.
The order in which the books are chosen does

The Binomial
Theorem
Expand a power of a binomial using Pascal’s triangle or factorial
notation.
Find a specific term of a binomial expansion.
Find the total number of subsets of a set of n objects.
In this section, we consider ways of expanding a binomial 
.
Binomial Expansions Using Pascal’s Triangle
Consider the following expanded powers of
, where 
is any
binomial and n is a whole number. Look for patterns.
1
Each expansion is a polynomial. There are some patterns to be noted.
1. There is one more term than the power of the exponent, n. That is,
there are 
terms in the expansion of
.
2. In each term, the sum of the exponents is n, the power to which the bi-
nomial is raised.
3. The exponents of a start with n, the power of the binomial, and de-
crease to 0. The last term has no factor of a. The first term has no 
factor of b, so powers of b start with 0 and increase to n.
4. The coefficients start at 1 and increase through certain values about
“half”-way and then decrease through these same values back to 1.

The Binomial Theorem

Let’s explore the coefficients further. Suppose that we want to find 
an expansion of
. The patterns we just noted indicate that there
are 7 terms in the expansion:
.
How can we determine the value of each coefficient,
? We can do so in
two ways. The first method involves writing the coefficients in a triangu-
lar array, as follows. This is known as Pascal’s triangle:

There are many patterns in the triangle. Find as many as you can.
Perhaps you discovered a way to write the next row of numbers, given
the numbers in the row above it. There are always 1’s on the outside. Each
remaining number is the sum of the two numbers above it. Let’s try to
find an expansion for 
by adding another row using the patterns
we have discovered:

the 1st and last numbers are 1;
the 2nd number is

the 3rd number is

the 4th number is 
, or 20;
the 5th number is

the 6th number is

Thus the expansion for

Binomial Expansion Using Factorial Notation
Suppose that we want to find the expansion of
. The disadvan-
tage in using Pascal’s triangle is that we must compute all the preceding
rows of the triangle to obtain the row needed for the expansion. The fol-
lowing method avoids this. It also enables us to find a specific term—
say, the 8th term—without computing all the other terms of the expan-
sion. This method is useful in such courses as finite mathematics, cal-
culus, and statistics, and it uses the binomial coefficient notation
developed in Section 10.6.
We can restate the binomial theorem as follows.
The Binomial Theorem Using Factorial Notation
For any binomial 
and any natural number n,
.
The binomial theorem can be proved by mathematical induction. (See 
Exercise 63.) This form shows why 
is called a binomial coefficient.

Finding a Specific Term
Suppose that we want to determine only a particular term of an expan-
sion. The method we have developed will allow us to find such a term
without computing all the rows of Pascal’s triangle or all the preceding
coefficients.

10.8
Probability
Compute the probability of a simple event.
When a coin is tossed, we can reason that the chance, or likelihood, that
it will fall heads is 1 out of 2, or the probability that it will fall heads is 
. Of course, this does not mean that if a coin is tossed 10 times it will
necessarily fall heads 5 times. If the coin is a “fair coin” and it is tossed a
great many times, however, it will fall heads very nearly half of the time.
Here we give an introduction to two kinds of probability, experimental
and theoretical.
Experimental and Theoretical Probability
If we toss a coin a great number of times—say, 1000—and count the
number of times it falls heads, we can determine the probability that it
will fall heads. If it falls heads 503 times, we would calculate the proba-
bility of its falling heads to be
,
or
0.503.
This is an experimental determination of probability. Such a determi-
nation of probability is discovered by the observation and study of data
and is quite common and very useful. Here, for example, are some proba-
bilities that have been determined experimentally:
1. The probability that a woman will get breast cancer in her lifetime 
is 
.
2. If you kiss someone who has a cold, the probability of your catching a
cold is 0.07.
3. A person who has just been released from prison has an 80% proba-
bility of returning.

Study Tip
It is always best to study for a final
exam over a period of at least two
weeks. If you have only one or two
days of study time, however, begin
by reviewing each chapter,
studying the formulas, theorems,
properties, and procedures in the
sections and in the Chapter
Summary and Review. Then do the
exercises in each Chapter
Summary and Review and in the
Chapter Test. Also attend a review
session if one is available.

If we consider a coin and reason that it is just as likely to fall heads 
as tails, we would calculate the probability that it will fall heads to be .
This is a theoretical determination of probability. Here are some other
probabilities that have been determined theoretically, using mathematics:
1. If there are 30 people in a room, the probability that two of them have the
same birthday (excluding year) is 0.706.
2. While on a trip, you meet someone and, after a period of conversation,
discover that you have a common acquaintance. The typical reaction,
“It’s a small world!”, is actually not appropriate, because the probabil-
ity of such an occurrence is quite high—just over 22%.
In summary, experimental probabilities are determined by making
observations and gathering data. Theoretical probabilities are determined
by reasoning mathematically. Examples of experimental and theoretical
probability like those above, especially those we do not expect, lead us 
to see the value of a study of probability. You might ask, “What is the 
true probability?” In fact, there is none. Experimentally, we can deter-
mine probabilities within certain limits. These may or may not agree 
with the probabilities that we obtain theoretically. There are situations in
which it is much easier to determine one of these types of probabilities
than the other. For example, it would be quite difficult to arrive at the
probability of catching a cold using theoretical probability.
Computing Experimental Probabilities
We first consider experimental determination of probability. The basic
principle we use in computing such probabilities is as follows.
Principle P (Experimental)
Given an experiment in which n observations are made, if a situation,
or event, E occurs m times out of n observations, then we say that the
experimental probability of the event,
, is given by
.
EXAMPLE 1
Sociological Survey.
The authors of this text conducted an
experimental survey to determine the number of people who are left-
handed, right-handed, or both. The results are shown in the graph at left.
a) Determine the probability that a person is right-handed.
b) Determine the probability that a person is left-handed.
c) Determine the probability that a person is ambidextrous (uses both
hands with equal ability).
d) There are 120 bowlers in most tournaments held by the Professional
Bowlers Association. On the basis of the data in this experiment, how
many of the bowlers would you expect to be left-handed?

Solution
a) The number of people who are right-handed is 82, the number who
are left-handed is 17, and the number who are ambidextrous is 1. The
total number of observations is 
, or 100. Thus the proba-
bility that a person is right-handed is P, where
,
or
0.82,
or
82%.
b) The probability that a person is left-handed is P, where
,
or
0.17,
or
17%.
c) The probability that a person is ambidextrous is P, where
,
or
0.01,
or 1%.
d) There are 120 bowlers, and from part (b) we can expect 17% to be 
left-handed. Since
17% of
,
we can expect that about 20 of the bowlers will be left-handed.
EXAMPLE 2
Quality Control.
It is very important for a manufacturer
to maintain the quality of its products. In fact, companies hire quality
control inspectors to ensure this process. The goal is to produce as few 
defective products as possible. But since a company is producing thou-
sands of products every day, it cannot afford to check every product to see
if it is defective. To find out what percentage of its products are defective,
the company checks a smaller sample.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that 80% of the seeds
that a company produces sprout. To determine the quality of the seeds it
produces, a company takes 500 seeds from those it has produced and
plants them. It finds that 417 of the seeds sprout.
a) What is the probability that a seed will sprout?
b) Did the seeds meet government standards?
Solution
a) We know that 500 seeds were planted and 417 sprouted. The proba-
bility of a seed sprouting is P, where
,
or
83.4%.
b) Since the percentage of seeds that sprouted exceeded the 80% require-
ment, the seeds meet government standards.

EXAMPLE 3
Television Ratings.
There are an estimated 105,500,000
households with televisions in the United States. Each week, viewing infor-
mation is collected and reported. In one week, 7,815,000 households tuned
in to the popular comedy series “Everybody Loves Raymond” on CBS and
8,302,000 households tuned in to the popular drama series “Law and
Order” on NBC (Source: Nielsen Media Research). What is the probability
that a television household tuned in to “Everybody Loves Raymond”
during the given week? to “Law and Order”?
Solution
The probability that a television household was tuned in to
“Everybody Loves Raymond” is P, where
.
The probability that a television household was tuned in to “Law and
Order” is P, where
.
These percentages are called ratings.
Theoretical Probability
Suppose that we perform an experiment such as flipping a coin, throwing
a dart, drawing a card from a deck, or checking an item off an assembly
line for quality. Each possible result of such an experiment is called an
outcome. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space. An
event is a set of outcomes, that is, a subset of the sample space.
EXAMPLE 4
Dart Throwing.
Consider this dartboard. Assume that the
experiment is “throwing a dart” and that the dart hits the board. Find
each of the following.
a) The outcomes
b) The sample space
Solution
a) The outcomes are hitting black (B), hitting red (R), and hitting 
white (W).
b) The sample space is 
, which
can be simply stated as

Suppose a die is rolled. Find each of the following.
a) The outcomes
b) The sample space
Solution
a) The outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
b) The sample space is 
.
We denote the probability that an event E occurs as 
. For ex-
ample, “a coin falling heads” may be denoted H. Then 
represents 
the probability of the coin falling heads. When all the outcomes of an ex-
periment have the same probability of occurring, we say that they are
equally likely. To see the distinction between events that are equally likely
and those that are not, consider the dartboards shown below.
For board A, the events hitting black, hitting red, and hitting white
are equally likely, because the black, red, and white areas are the same.
However, for board B the areas are not the same so these events are not
equally likely.
Principle P (Theoretical)
If an event E can occur m ways out of n possible equally likely
outcomes of a sample space S, then the theoretical probability
of the event,
, is given by
.
EXAMPLE 6
What is the probability of rolling a 3 on a die?
Solution
On a fair die, there are 6 equally likely outcomes and there is
1 way to roll a 3. By Principle P,

EXAMPLE 7
What is the probability of rolling an even number on

ting 2, 4, or 6). The number of equally likely outcomes is 6. By Prin-
ciple P,

We will use a number of examples related to a standard bridge deck
of 52 cards. Such a deck is made up as shown in the following figure.
EXAMPLE 8
What is the probability of drawing an ace from a well-
shuffled deck of cards?
Solution
There are 52 outcomes (the number of cards in the deck), they
are equally likely (from a well-shuffled deck), and there are 4 ways to 
obtain an ace, so by Principle P, we have
,
or
.
EXAMPLE 9
Suppose that we select, without looking, one marble from
a bag containing 3 red marbles and 4 green marbles. What is the proba-
bility of selecting a red marble?
Solution
There are 7 equally likely ways of selecting any marble, and
since the number of ways of getting a red marble is 3, we have
.
The following are some results that follow from Principle P.
Probability Properties
a) If an event E cannot occur, then 
.
b) If an event E is certain to occur, then 
.
c) The probability that an event E will occur is a number from 0 
to 1:
.
For example, in coin tossing, the event that a coin will land on its 
edge has probability 0. The event that a coin falls either heads or tails has
probability 1.
In the following examples, we use the combinatorics that we studied in
Sections 10.5 and 10.6 to calculate theoretical probabilities.

EXAMPLE 10
Suppose that 2 cards are drawn from a well-shuffled
deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that both of them are spades?
Solution
The number of ways n of drawing 2 cards from a well-shuffled
deck of 52 cards is 
. Since 13 of the 52 cards are spades, the number of
ways m of drawing 2 spades is 
. Thus,
.
EXAMPLE 11
Suppose that 3 people are selected at random from a group
that consists of 6 men and 4 women. What is the probability that 1 man
and 2 women are selected?
Solution
The number of ways of selecting 3 people from a group of 10 is
. One man can be selected in 
ways, and 2 women can be selected 
in 
ways. By the fundamental counting principle, the number of ways 
of selecting 1 man and 2 women is 
. Thus the probability that 
1 man and 2 women are selected is
.
EXAMPLE 12
Rolling Two Dice.
What is the probability of getting a
total of 8 on a roll of a pair of dice?
Solution
On each die, there are 6 possible outcomes. The outcomes are
paired so there are 
, or 36, possible ways in which the two can fall.
(Assuming that the dice are different—say, one red and one blue—can
help in visualizing this.)
The pairs that total 8 are as shown in the figure above. There are 
5 possible ways of getting a total of 8, so the probability is

Basic Concepts
from Geometry
Classify an angle as right, straight, acute, or obtuse.
Identify complementary and supplementary angles and find the
measure of a complement or a supplement of a given angle.
Find the lengths of sides of similar triangles.
Given the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, find the length of
the third side.
In this appendix, we present a review of some basic concepts from geometry.
A summary of formulas from geometry is found near the back of the book.
Classifying Angles
The following are ways in which we classify angles.
Types of Angles
Right angle: An angle whose measure is 90.
Straight angle: An angle whose measure is 180.
Acute angle: An angle whose measure is greater than 0 and less
than 90.
Obtuse angle: An angle whose measure is greater than 90 and less
than 180.

EXAMPLE 1
Classify the angle as right, straight, acute, or obtuse.
a)
b)
c)
d)
Solution
a) We observe that the measure of this angle is 90, so it is a right angle.
(We could also use a protractor to measure the angle.)
b) We observe that the measure of this angle is greater than 0 and less
than 90. It is an acute angle.
c) We observe that the measure of this angle is greater than 90 and less
than 180. It is an obtuse angle.
d) We observe that the measure of this angle is 180, so it is a straight angle.
Complementary and Supplementary Angles
We can describe the relationship between certain pairs of angles on the
basis of the sum of their measures.
Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90.
Each angle is called a complement of the other.

and 
above are complementary angles.
If two angles are complementary, each is an acute angle. When comple-
mentary angles are adjacent to each other, they form a right angle.
EXAMPLE 2
Identify each pair of complementary angles.

We look for pairs of angles for which the sum of the measures
is 90. They are

Find the measure of a complement of an angle of 39.
Solution
The measure of a complement is 51.
Next, consider

as shown below. Because the sum of their
measures is 180,
and 
are said to be supplementary. Note that when
supplementary angles are adjacent, they form a straight angle.

Solution
Pairs (a), (c), and (d) appear to be similar because they appear to
have the same shape.
Similar triangles have corresponding sides and angles.
EXAMPLE 7
and 
are similar. Name their corresponding
sides and angles.
Solution
The symbol 
means “corresponds to.”
Two triangles are similar if and only if their vertices can be matched
so that the corresponding angles have the same measure and the
lengths of corresponding sides are proportional.
To say that 
and 
are similar, we write “
.”
We will agree that this symbol also tells us the way in which the vertices are
matched.
Thus,

These triangles are similar. Which sides are proportional?
Solution
It appears that if we match X with U, Y with W, and Z with V,
the corresponding angles have the same measure. Thus,

Proportions and Similar Triangles
We can find lengths of sides in similar triangles.

Similar triangles and proportions can often be used to find lengths
that would ordinarily be difficult to measure. For example, we could find
the height of a flagpole without climbing it or the distance across a river
without crossing it.

EXAMPLE 11
Height of a Flagpole.
How 
high is a flagpole that casts a 56-ft shadow 
at the same time that a 6-ft man casts a 5-ft 
shadow?
Solution
If we use the sun’s rays to represent the third side of the triangle
in our drawing of the situation, we see that we have similar triangles. Let
the height of the flagpole. Then the ratio of 6 to p is the same as the
ratio of 5 to 56. Thus we have the proportion
.
Multiplying by 56p on both sides
Dividing by 5 on both sides
Simplifying
The height of the flagpole is 67.2 ft.

Right Triangles
A right triangle is a triangle with a 90 angle, as shown in the figure below.
The small square in the corner indicates the 90 angle.
In a right triangle, the longest side is called the hypotenuse. It is the side
opposite the right angle. The other two sides are called legs. We generally
use the letters a and b for the lengths of the legs and c for the length 
of the hypotenuse. They are related as follows.
The Pythagorean Theorem
In any right triangle, if a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the
length of the hypotenuse, then
.
The equation 
is called the Pythagorean equation.

The Pythagorean theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathe-
matician Pythagoras (569?–500? B.C.). It is uncertain who actually proved
this result the first time. A proof can be found in most geometry books.
If we know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, we can find
the length of the third side.

60. Discussion and Writing [R.2] Anya is probably not
following the rules for order of operations. She is subtracting 
6 from 15 first, then dividing the difference by 3, and finally
multiplying the quotient by 4. The correct answer is 7.
61. Discussion and Writing [R.2] When the number 4 is 
raised to a positive integer power, the last digit of the result is 4
or 6. Since the calculator returns 
, or
4,398,046,511,000, we can conclude that this result is an
approximation.

85. Discussion and Writing [3.1], [3.5] A polynomial function
is a function that can be defined by a polynomial expression. A
rational function is a function that can be defined as a
quotient of two polynomials.
86. Discussion and Writing [3.5] Vertical asymptotes occur at
any x-values that make the denominator zero. The graph of a
rational function does not cross any vertical asymptotes.
Horizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator
is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator. Oblique
asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is 1
greater than the degree of the denominator. Graphs of rational
functions may cross horizontal or oblique asymptotes.

75. Discussion and Writing [5.1], [5.4] Both degrees and
radians are units of angle measure. A degree is defined to be
of one complete positive revolution. Degree notation has
been in use since Babylonian times. Radians are defined in
terms of intercepted arc length on a circle, with one radian
being the measure of the angle for which the arc length equals
the radius. There are 
radians in one complete revolution.
76. Discussion and Writing [5.5] The graph of the cosine
function is shaped like a continuous wave, with “high” points
at 
and “low” points at 
. The maximum value of
the cosine function is 1, and it occurs at all points where
,
.
77. Discussion and Writing [5.5] No; sin x is never greater
than 1.
78. Discussion and Writing [5.6] When x is very large or very
small, the amplitude of the function becomes small. The
dimensions of the window must be adjusted to be able to see
the shape of the graph. Also, when x is 0, the function is

Answers may vary. Method 2 may be the more efficient
because it involves straightforward factorization and
simplification. Method 1(a) requires a “trick” such as
multiplying by a particular expression equivalent to 1.
69. Discussion and Writing [6.4] The ranges of the inverse
trigonometric functions are restricted in order that they 
might be functions.

86. Discussion and Writing [7.4] A nonzero complex number
has n different complex nth roots. Thus, 1 has three different
complex cube roots, one of which is the real number 1. The
other two are complex conjugates. Since the set of reals is a
subset of the set of complex numbers, the real cube root of 1 is
also a complex root of 1.
87. Discussion and Writing [7.1], [7.2] A triangle has no
solution when a sine or cosine value found is less than 1 
or greater than 1. A triangle also has no solution if the sum 
of the angle measures calculated is greater than 180. A
triangle has only one solution if only one possible answer 
is found, or if one of the possible answers has an angle sum
greater than 180. A triangle has two solutions when two
possible answers are found and neither results in an angle 
sum greater than 180.
