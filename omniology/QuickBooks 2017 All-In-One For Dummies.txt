Introduction      1
Introduction
F
ew people read introductions to reference books, so I’ll make this very brief. 
I just want to tell you which versions of QuickBooks this book works for, 
what’s in the reference, what it assumes about your existing skills, and what 
conventions I use.
About This Book
The desktop version of QuickBooks comes in several flavors, including QuickBooks 
Self-Employed, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise 
Solutions. This reference talks about QuickBooks 2017 Enterprise Solutions, which 
is a superset of QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Pro. If you’re using Quick-
Books Self-Employed or QuickBooks Online, you shouldn’t use this book. Sorry.
On the other hand, even though this book is written for QuickBooks Enterprise 
Solutions, if you’re using QuickBooks Premier or QuickBooks Pro, don’t worry. 
You’re just fine with this book. And don’t freak out if you’re using some version 
of QuickBooks that’s very similar to QuickBooks 2017, such as QuickBooks 2016 or 
QuickBooks 2018. Although this reference is about QuickBooks 2017, it also works 
just fine for the 2015, 2016, and probably 2018 versions of QuickBooks because 
QuickBooks is a very mature product at this point. The changes from one year to the 
next are modest. This means that if you’re using QuickBooks 2016, stuff may look a 
little different if you closely compare the images in this book with what you see on 
your screen, but the information in this reference will still apply to your situation.
Note, too, that specialty versions of QuickBooks, such as QuickBooks Accountant’s 
Edition and QuickBooks Contractor, also work almost identically to QuickBooks 
Premier.
If you use QuickBooks Pro and see some whistle or bell that you really want to use 
but that isn’t available in your version of QuickBooks, you’ll know that you should 
upgrade to the Premier version or Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks.
The bottom line? Yes, QuickBooks comes in several flavors. Yes, Intuit publishes 
new editions of its QuickBooks products every year. But you can use this book for 
any recent version of QuickBooks Pro, Premier, or Enterprise Solutions.

2      QuickBooks 2017 All-in-One For Dummies
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the conven-
tions I use in this book:
»
» When I want you to type something such as Jennifer, it’s in bold letters.
»
» By the way, except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of 
the stuff you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type 
JENNIFER. Or you can follow poet e e cummings’s lead and type jennifer.
»
» Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like 
Choose Lists ➪ Items, which simply means to first choose the Lists menu 
and then choose Items. The ➪ separates one part of the command from the 
next part.
»
» You can choose menus and commands and select dialog-box elements with 
the mouse. Just click the thing that you want to select.
»
» While I’m on the subject of conventions, let me also mention something about 
QuickBooks conventions, because it turns out that there’s really no good place 
to point this out. QuickBooks doesn’t use document windows the same way 
that other Windows programs do. Instead, it locks the active window into 
place and then displays a list of windows in its Navigator pane, which is like 
another little window. To move to a listed window, you click it.
You can tell QuickBooks to use windows like every other program does, however, 
by choosing View ➪ Multiple Windows. You can even remove the Navigator pane by 
choosing View ➪ Open Window List.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m making only three assumptions about your QuickBooks and accounting skills:
»
» You have a PC with Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10. (I took pictures of the 
QuickBooks windows and dialog boxes in Windows 10, in case you’re interested.)
»
» You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
»
» You have, or will buy, a copy of QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, or 
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions for each computer on which you want to run 
the program.
In other words, I don’t assume that you’re a computer genius or an MBA, or that 
you’re superexperienced in the arcane rules of accounting. I assume that Quick-
Books and accounting are new subjects to you. But I also assume that you want to 
understand the subjects because you need to do so for your job or your business.

Introduction      3
Icons Used in This Book
Like many computer books, this book uses icons, or little pictures, to flag things 
that don’t quite fit into the flow of things.
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It marks important information that may 
save you headaches when using QuickBooks 2017.
Remember icons mark the information that’s especially important to know. To 
siphon off the most important information in each chapter, just skim these icons.
The Tip icon marks tips (duh!) and shortcuts that you can use to make QuickBooks 
easier.
The Technical Stuff icon marks information of a highly technical nature that you 
normally can skip.
Beyond the Book
QuickBooks 2017 All-in-One For Dummies includes some extra content that you bought 
with your book but didn’t actually get inside the book. Okay, I know that sounds bad 
at first blush. But don’t worry. This extra, premium stuff is available online:

Where to Go from Here
This reference combines eight short books, including a minibook about accounting, 
one about setting up the QuickBooks system, one for bookkeepers using Quick-
Books, one for accountants and managers using QuickBooks, a minibook about 

4      QuickBooks 2017 All-in-One For Dummies
small-business financial management, a minibook about business ­planning, a 
minibook about taking care of a QuickBooks accounting system, and a minibook 
of appendixes of further useful information.
I’m not going to go into more detail here about what’s available in the book. If you 
have a specific question about what’s covered or where some topic is covered, refer 
to the table of contents in the front of this reference. Also remember that the book 
provides an index to help you find just the pages that have the information you need.
While I’m on the subject of what’s in this book and how to find information, 
let me make four tangential points:
»
» You’ll never read this book from cover to cover unless you’re someone who 
has an obsessive-compulsive personality (like me) and many hours to devote 
to reading. But that’s okay. This reference isn’t meant to be read from cover to 
cover like some Val McDermid page-turner. Instead, chapters within the eight 
minibooks are organized into largely self-contained descriptions of how you 
do the things that you need to do. You just read the paragraph, page, or 
chapter that provides the information you want.
»
» I haven’t discussed in any detail how to use the QuickBooks Premier and 
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions features for business planning. The wizard-
based approach that QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Enterprise 
Solutions provide for business planning is not, in my humble opinion, the right 
way to do this. Instead, I discuss in detail alternative, superior approaches to 
business planning and budgeting (using spreadsheets) in Book 6. (Just so you 
know: The approach I describe and recommend here is the same one that any 
business school teaches its students.)
»
» At a few points in the book, you’ll find me saying things like “Well, I really don’t 
think you should use this part of the product.” I just want to explain here, up 
front, where I’m coming from on this. First, know that I think QuickBooks is an 
outstanding product, but not every feature and every command is good. I’ve 
already mentioned that the new business planning tools aren’t ones that I can 
recommend. And payroll, very frankly, is another pain-in-the-butt feature 
that most businesses should avoid. (I do briefly discuss payroll in Book 3, 
Chapter 5.) So if I think that a particular feature is one that you shouldn’t use, 
I don’t take up page space (or much page space) describing the feature. I’d 
rather use that space to describe other stuff that I believe is going to be 
valuable to you and other readers.
»
» I should also mention one final thing: Accounting software programs require 
you to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use them to get real 
work done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks yet, I recommend that 
you skim Book 1 and then read Book 2 to find out what you need to do first.

Principles of Accounting
A
ny discussion of how to use QuickBooks to better manage your business 
begins with a discussion of the basics of accounting. For this reason, 
in this chapter and the next two, I attempt to provide the same infor-
mation that you would receive in an introductory college accounting course. 
I tailor the entire discussion, of course, to QuickBooks and the small-business 
environment. What you’ll read about here and in the next chapters of this book 
pretty much describes how accounting works in a small-business setting using 
QuickBooks.
If you’ve had some experience with accounting, if you know how to read an 
income statement and balance sheet, or if you know how to construct a journal 
entry, you don’t need to read this chapter or the next. But if you’re new to account-
ing and business bookkeeping, take the time to read this chapter carefully. I start 
the chapter by giving you a high-level overview of the purpose of accounting. Then 
I review the common financial statements that any accounting system worth its 
salt produces. I also discuss some of the important principles of accounting and the 
philosophy of accounting. Finally, I talk a little bit about income tax law and tax 
accounting.

The Purpose of Accounting
In the movie Creator, Peter O’Toole plays an eccentric professor. At one point, 
O’Toole’s character attempts to talk a young student into working as an unpaid 
research assistant. When the student protests, noting that he needs 15 credit 
hours, O’Toole creates a special 15-credit independent-study course named 
“Introduction to the Big Picture.” In the next section, I describe the “big picture” 
of accounting. At its core, accounting makes perfect, logical sense.
The big picture
The most important thing to understand about accounting is that it provides finan-
cial information to stakeholders. Stakeholders are the people who do business with 
or interact with a firm; they include managers, employees, investors, banks, ven-
dors, government authorities, and agencies that may tax a firm. Stakeholders and 
their information requirements deserve a bit more discussion. Why? Because the 
­information needs of these stakeholders determine what an accounting system 
must do.
Managers, investors, and entrepreneurs
The first category of stakeholders includes the firm’s managers, investors, and 
entrepreneurs. This group needs financial information to determine whether a 
business is making money. This group also wants any information that gives 
insight into whether a business is growing or contracting and how healthy or sick 
it is. To fulfill its obligations and duties, this group often needs detailed informa-
tion. A manager or entrepreneur may want to know which customers are particu-
larly profitable — or unprofitable. An active investor may want to know which 
product lines are growing or contracting.
A related set of information requirements concerns asset and liability record 
keeping. An asset is something that the firm owns, such as cash, inventory, or 
equipment. A liability is some debt or obligation that the firm owes, such as bank 
loans and accounts payable.
Obviously, someone at a firm — perhaps a manager, bookkeeper, or accountant — 
needs to have very detailed records of the amount of cash that the firm has in its 
bank accounts, the inventory that the firm has in its warehouse or on its shelves, 
and the equipment that the firm owns and uses in its operations.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      9
If you look over the preceding two or three paragraphs, nothing I’ve said is 
­particularly surprising. It makes sense, right? Someone who works in a busi-
ness, manages a business, or actively invests in a business needs good gen-
eral ­information about the financial affairs of the firm and, in many cases, very 
detailed information about important assets (such as cash) and liabilities (such as 
bank loans).
External creditors
A second category of stakeholders includes outside firms that lend money to a 
business and credit-reporting agencies that supply information to these lenders. 
Banks want to know about the financial affairs and financial condition of a firm 
before lending money, for example. The accounting system needs to produce the 
financial information that a bank requires to consider a loan request.
What information do lenders want? Lenders want to know that a business is prof-
itable and enjoys a positive cash flow. Profits and positive cash flows allow a busi-
ness to easily repay debt. A bank or other lender also wants to see assets that could 
be liquidated, in a worst-case scenario, to pay a loan — and other debts that may 
represent a claim on the firm’s assets.
Vendors also typically require financial information from a firm. A vendor often 
lends money to a firm by extending trade credit. What’s noteworthy about this 
is that vendors sometimes require special accounting. One of the categories of 
vendors that a company such as John Wiley & Sons, Inc., deals with is authors. To 
pay an author the royalty that he or she is entitled to, Wiley puts in a fair amount 
of work to calculate royalty-per-unit amounts and then reports and remits these 
amounts to authors.
Other firms sometimes have similar financial reporting requirements for ven-
dors. Franchisees (such as the man or woman who owns and operates the local 
McDonald’s) pay a franchise fee based on revenue. Retailers may perform special 
accounting and reporting to enjoy rebates and incentives from the manufacturers 
of the products that they sell.
Government agencies
Predictable stakeholders that require financial information from a business also 
include the federal and state government agencies with jurisdiction over the firm. 
Every business in the United States needs to report on its revenue, expenses, and 
profits so that the firm can correctly calculate income tax due to the federal gov-
ernment (and often the state government too) and then pay that tax.

10      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Firms with employees must also report to the federal and state governments on 
wages paid to those employees and pay payroll taxes based on metrics, such as 
number of employees, wages paid to employees, and unemployment benefits 
claimed by past employees.
Providing this sort of financial information to government agencies represents a 
key duty of a firm’s accounting system.
Business form generation
In addition to the financial reporting described in the preceding paragraphs, 
accounting systems typically perform a key task for businesses: producing busi-
ness forms. An accounting system almost always produces the checks needed to 
pay vendors, for example. In addition, an accounting system prepares the invoices 
and payroll checks. More sophisticated accounting systems, such as those used 
by large firms, prepare many other business forms, including purchase orders, 
monthly customer statements, credit memos to customers, sales receipts, and 
so forth.
Every accounting function that I’ve described so far is performed ably by each of 
the versions of QuickBooks: QuickBooks Simple Start, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks 
Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise.
Reviewing the Common 
Financial Statements
With the background information just provided, I’m ready to talk about some of 
the common financial statements or accounting reports that an accounting sys-
tem like QuickBooks produces. If you understand which reports you want your 
accounting system to produce, you should find it much easier to collect the raw 
data necessary to prepare these reports.
In the following sections, I describe the three principal financial statements: 
the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. I also 
briefly describe a fourth, catch-all category: accounting reports.
Don’t worry — I go through this material slowly. You need to understand what 
financial statements your accounting systems are supposed to provide and what 
data these financial statements supply.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      11
The income statement
Perhaps the most important financial statement that an accounting system pro-
duces is the income statement. The income statement is also known as a profit and 
loss statement. An income statement summarizes a firm’s revenues and expenses 
for a particular period of time. Revenue represents amounts that a business earns 
by providing goods and services to its customers. Expenses represent amounts that 
a firm spends providing those goods and services. If a business can provide goods 
or services to customers for revenue that exceeds its expenses, the firm earns a 
profit. If expenses exceed revenue, obviously, the firm suffers a loss.
To show you how this all works — and it’s really pretty simple — take a look at 
Tables 1-1 and 1-2. Table 1-1 summarizes the sales that an imaginary business 
enjoys. Table 1-2 summarizes the expenses that the same business incurs for the 
same period. These two tables provide all the information necessary to construct 
an income statement.

12      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Using the information from Tables  1-1 and  1-2, you can construct the simple 
income statement shown in Table 1-3. Understanding the details of an income 
statement is key to your understanding of how accounting works and what 
accounting tries to do. Therefore, I want to go into some detail discussing this 
income statement.
The first thing to note about the income statement shown in Table 1-3 is the sales 
revenue figure of $13,000. This figure shows the sales generated for a particular 
period of time. The $13,000 figure shown in Table 1-3 comes directly from the 
sales journal shown in Table 1-1.
One important thing to recognize about accounting for sales revenue is that rev-
enue gets counted when goods or services are provided, not when a customer pays 
for the goods or services. If you look at the list of sales shown in Table 1-1, for 
example, Joe (the first customer listed) may have paid $1,000 in cash, but Bob, 
Frank, and Abdul (the second, third, and fourth customers) may have paid for 
their purchases with a credit card. Yoshio, Marie, Jeremy, and Chang (the fifth 
through eighth customers listed) may not have even paid for their purchases at 
the time the goods or services were provided. These customers may have simply 
promised to pay for the purchases at some later date. The timing of payment for 
goods or services doesn’t matter, however. Accountants have figured out that you 
count revenue when goods or services are provided. Information about when cus-
tomers pay for those goods or services, if you want that information, can come 
from lists of customer payments.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      13
Cost of goods sold and gross margins are two other values that you commonly see in 
income statements. Before I discuss cost of goods sold and gross margins, how-
ever, let me add a little more detail to this example. Suppose that the financial 
information in Tables 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3 shows the financial results from your busi-
ness: the hot dog stand that you operate for one day at the major sporting event in 
the city where you live. Table 1-1 describes sales to hungry customers. Table 1-2 
summarizes the one-day expenses of operating your super-duper hot dog stand.
In this case, the actual items that you sell — hot dogs and buns — are shown 
separately in the income statement as cost of goods sold. By separately showing 
the cost of the goods sold, the income statement can show what is called a gross 
margin. The gross margin is the amount of revenue left over after paying for the 
cost of goods. In Table 1-3, the cost of goods sold equals $3,000 for purchases 
of dogs and buns. The difference between the $13,000 of sales revenue and the 
$3,000 of cost of goods sold equals $10,000, which is the gross margin.
Knowing how to calculate gross margin allows you to estimate firm break-even 
points and to perform profit, volume, and cost analyses. All these techniques are 
extremely useful for thinking about the financial affairs of your business. In fact, 
Book 6, Chapter 1 describes how you can perform these analyses.
The operating expenses portion of the simple income statement shown in Table 1-3 
repeats the other information listed in the expenses journal. The $1,000 of rent, 
the $4,000 of wages, and the $1,000 of supplies get totaled. These operating 
expenses are then subtracted from the gross.
Do you see, then, what an income statement does? An income statement reports 
on the revenue that a firm has generated. It shows the cost of goods sold and cal-
culates the gross margin. It identifies and shows operating expenses, and finally 
shows the profits of the business.
One other important point: Income statements summarize revenue, expenses, 
and profits for a particular period. Some managers and entrepreneurs, for exam-
ple, may want to prepare income statements on a daily basis. Public companies 
are required to prepare income statements on a quarterly and annual basis. And 
taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), require tax return 
preparation both quarterly and annually.
Technically speaking, the quarterly statements required by the IRS don’t need 
to report revenue. The IRS requires quarterly statements only of wages paid to 
employees. Only the annual income statements required by the IRS report both 
revenue and expenses. These income statements are produced to prepare an 
annual income tax return.

14      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Balance sheet
The second most important financial statement that an accounting system pro-
duces is a balance sheet. A balance sheet reports on a business’s assets, liabilities, 
and owner contributions of capital at a particular point in time:
»
» The assets shown in a balance sheet are those items that are owned by the 
business, which have value and for which money was paid.
»
» The liabilities shown in a balance sheet are those amounts that a business 
owes to other people, businesses, and government agencies.
»
» The owner contributions of capital are the amounts that owners, partners, or 
shareholders have paid into the business in the form of investment or have 
reinvested in the business by leaving profits inside the company.
As long as you understand what assets and liabilities are, a balance sheet is easy to 
understand and interpret. Table 1-4, for example, shows a simple balance sheet. 
Pretend that this balance sheet shows the condition of the hot dog stand at the 
beginning of the day, before any hot dogs have been sold. The first portion of the 
balance sheet shows and totals the two assets of the hot-dog-stand business:  
the $1,000 cash in the cash register in a box under the counter and the $3,000 
worth of hot dogs and buns that you’ve purchased to sell during the day.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      15
Balance sheets can use several other categories to report assets: accounts receiv-
able (amounts that customers owe), investments, fixtures, equipment, and long-
term investments. In the case of a small owner-operated business, not all these 
asset categories show up. But if you look at the balance sheet of a very large 
­business — say, one of the 100 largest businesses in the United States — you see 
these other categories.
The liabilities section of the balance sheet shows the amounts that the firm owes 
to other people and businesses. The balance sheet in Table 1-4 shows $2,000 of 
accounts payable and a $1,000 loan payable. Presumably, the $2,000 of accounts 
payable is the money that you owe to the vendors who supplied your hot dogs and 
buns. The $1,000 loan payable represents some loan you’ve taken out — perhaps 
from some well-meaning and naive relative.
The owner’s equity section shows the amount that the owner, the partners, 
or shareholders have contributed to the business in the form of original funds 
invested or profits reinvested. One important point about the balance sheet shown 
in Table 1-4: This balance sheet shows how owner’s equity looks when the busi-
ness is a sole proprietorship. In the case of a sole proprietor, only one line is 
reported in the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet. This line combines 
all contributions made by the proprietor — both amounts originally invested and 
amounts reinvested.
I talk a bit more about owner’s equity accounting later in this chapter because 
the owner’s equity sections look different for partnerships and corporations. 
Before I get into that, however, let me make two important observations about the 
balance sheet shown in Table 1-4:
»
» A balance sheet needs to balance. This means that the total assets must 
equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity. In the balance sheet shown in 
Table 1-4, for example, total assets show as $4,000. Total liabilities and 
owner’s equity also show as $4,000. This equality is no coincidence. If an 
accounting system works right, and the accountants and bookkeepers 
entering information into this system do their jobs right, the balance 
sheet balances.
»
» A balance sheet provides a snapshot of a business’s financial condition 
at a particular point in time. I mention in the introductory remarks related 
to Table 1-4 that the balance sheet in this table shows the financial condition 
of the hot-dog-stand business immediately before the day’s business activities 
begin.
You can prepare a balance sheet for any point in time. It’s key that you understand 
that a balance sheet is prepared for a particular point in time.

16      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
By convention, businesses prepare balance sheets to show the financial condi-
tion at the end of the period of time for which an income statement is prepared. 
A business typically prepares an income statement on an annual basis. In this 
orthodox situation, a firm also prepares a balance sheet at the very end of the year.
At this point, I return to something that I allude to earlier in the chapter: the fact 
that the owner’s equity section of a balance sheet looks different for different 
types of businesses.
Table 1-5 shows how the owner’s equity section of a balance sheet looks for a 
partnership. In Table 1-5, I show how the owner’s equity section of the hot-dog- 
stand business appears if, instead of having a sole proprietor named S. Nelson 
running the stand, the business is actually owned and operated by three partners 
named Tom, Dick, and Harry. In this case, the partners’ equity section shows the 
amounts originally invested and any amounts reinvested by the partners. As is the 
case with sole proprietorships, each partner’s contributions and reinvested profits 
appear on a single line.
Go ahead and take a look at Table 1-6. It shows how the owner’s equity section 
looks for a corporation.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      17
This next part is a little bit weird. For a corporation, the amounts that appear in 
the owner’s equity or shareholders’ equity section actually fall into two major 
categories: retained earnings and contributed capital. Retained earnings represent 
profits that the shareholders have left in the business. Contributed capital is the 
money originally contributed by the shareholders to the corporation.
The retained-earnings thing makes sense, right? That’s just the money — the 
profits — that investors have reinvested in the business.
The contributed-capital thing is more complicated. Here’s how it works. If you 
buy a share of stock in some new corporation — for, say, $5 — typically, some 
portion of that price per share is for par value. Now, don’t ask me to justify par 
value. It stems from business practices that were common a century or more 
ago. Just trust that typically, if you pay some amount — again, say $5 — for a 
share, some portion of the amount that you pay — maybe 10 cents a share or $1 a 
share — is for par value.
In the owner’s equity section of a corporation’s balance sheet, capital that’s con-
tributed by original investors is broken down into the amounts paid for this mys-
terious par value and the amounts paid in excess of this par value. In Table 1-6,  
you can see that $100 of shareholders’ equity or owner’s equity represents 
amounts paid for par value. Another $400 of the amounts contributed by the 
original investors represents amounts paid in excess of par value. The total share-
holders’ equity, or total corporate owner’s equity, equals the sum of the capital 
stock par value, the contributed capital and excess of par value, and any retained 
earnings. So in Table 1-6, the total shareholders’ equity equals $1,000.
Statement of cash flows
Now I come to the one tricky financial statement: the statement of cash flows.
Before I begin, I have one comment to make about the statement of cash flows: As 
an accountant, I’ve worked with many bright managers and businesspeople. No 
matter how much hand-holding and explanation I (or other accountants) provide, 
some of these smart people never quite get some of the numbers on the statement 
of cash flows. In fact, many of the students who major in accounting never (in my 
opinion, at least) quite understand how a statement of cash flows really works.
For this reason, don’t spend too much time spinning your wheels on this state-
ment or trying to understand what it does. QuickBooks does supply a statement of 
cash flows, but you don’t need to use this statement. In fact, QuickBooks produces 

18      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
cash basis income statements, which give you almost the same information — 
and in a format that’s easier to understand.
I think the best way to explain what a statement of cash flows does is to ask  
you to look again at the balance sheet shown in Table 1-4 earlier in this chapter. 
This table is the balance sheet for the imaginary hot dog stand at the beginning 
of the day.
Now take a look at Table 1-7, which shows the balance sheet at the end of the day, 
after operations for the hot dog stand have ended. Notice that at the start of the 
day (see Table 1-4), cash equals $1,000, and at the end of the day (see Table 1-7), 
cash equals $5,000. The statement of cash flows explains why cash changes from 
the one number to the other number over a period of time. In other words, a state-
ment of cash flows explains how cash goes from $1,000 at the start of the day to 
$5,000 at the end of the day.
Table 1-8, not coincidentally, shows a statement of cash flows that explains how 
cash flowed for your imaginary hot-dog-stand business. If you’re reading this 
book, presumably you need to understand this statement. I start at the bottom of 
the statement and work up.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      19
By convention, accountants show negative numbers inside parentheses. These 
parentheses flag negative values more clearly than a simple minus sign can.
The last three lines of the statement of cash flows are all easily understandable. 
The cash balance at the end of the period, $5,000, shows what cash the business 
holds at the end of the day. The cash balance at the start of the period, $1,000, 
shows the cash that the business holds at the beginning of the day. Both the cash 
balance at the start of the period and the cash balance at the end of the period tie 
to the cash balance values reported in the two balance sheets. (Look at Table 1-4 
and Table 1-7 to corroborate this assertion.) Clearly, if you start the period with 
$1,000 and end the period with $5,000, cash has increased by $4,000. That’s an 
arithmetical certainty. No question there, right?
The financing activities of the statement of cash flows show how firm borrowing 
and firm debt repayment affect the firm cash flow. If the hot-dog-stand business 
uses its profits to repay the $1,000 loan payable — and in this case, this is what 
happened — this $1,000 cash outflow shows up in the financing activities portion 
of the statement of cash flows as a negative $1,000.
The top portion of the statement of cash flows is often the trickiest to understand. 
Note, however, that I’ve talked about everything else in this statement. So with 
a strong push, you can fight your way through to understanding what’s going 
on here.

The operating activities portion of the statement of cash flows essentially shows 
the cash that comes from the profit. If you look at Table 1-8, for example, you 
see that the first line in the operating activities portion of the statement of cash 
flows is net income of $4,000. This is the net income amount reported on the 
income statement for the period. The net income or operating profit reported in 
the business’s income statement, however, isn’t necessarily the same thing as 
cash income or cash profit. A variety of factors must be adjusted to convert this 
net income amount to what’s essentially a cash amount of operating profit.
In the case of the hot-dog-stand business, if you use some of the profits to pay 
off all the accounts payable, this payoff uses up some of your cash profit. This is 
exactly what Table 1-8 shows. You can see that the decrease in the accounts pay-
able from $2,000 to $0 over the day required, quite logically, $2,000 of the net 
income. Another way to think about this is that essentially, you used up $2,000 of 
your cash profits to pay off accounts payable. Remember that the accounts payable 
is the amount that you owed your vendors for hot dogs and buns.
Another adjustment is required for the decrease in inventory. The decrease in 
inventory from the start of the period to the end of the period produces cash. 
Basically, you’re liquidating inventory. Another way to think about this is that 
although this inventory — the hot dogs and buns, in this example — shows up as 
an expense for the day’s income statement, it isn’t purchased during the day. It 
doesn’t consume cash during the day; it was purchased at some point in the past.
When you combine the net income, the accounts payable adjustment, and the 
inventory adjustment, you get the net cash provided by the operating activities. 
In Table 1-8, these three amounts combine for $5,000 of cash provided by the 
operations.
After you understand the details of the financing and operating activities areas 
of the statement of cash flows, the statement makes sense. Net cash provided by 
the operating activities equals $5,000. Financing activities reduce cash by $1,000. 
This means that cash actually increased over the period by $4,000, which explains 
why cash starts the period at $1,000 and ends the period at $5,000.
Other accounting statements
You can probably come up with examples of several other popular or useful 
accounting reports. Not surprisingly, a good accounting system such as Quick-
Books produces most of these reports. One very common report or financial state-
ment, for example, is a list of the amounts that your customers owe you. It’s a 
good idea to prepare and review such reports on a regular basis to make sure that 
you don’t have customers turning into collection problems.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      21
Table 1-9 shows how the simplest sort of accounts receivable report may look. 
Each customer is named along with the amount owed.
Table 1-10 shows another common accounting report: an inventory report that 
the hot dog stand may have at the start of the day. An inventory report like the 
one shown in Table 1-10 would probably name the various items held for resale, 
the quantity held, and the amount or value of the inventory item. A report such as 
this is useful to make sure that you have the appropriate quantities of inventory in 
stock. (Think of how useful such a report would be if you really were planning to 
sell thousands of hot dogs at major sporting events in your hometown.)
Putting it all together
By now, you should understand what an accounting system does. When you boil 
everything down to its essence, it’s straightforward, isn’t it? Really, an account-
ing system just provides you the financial information that you need to run your 
business.

CURIOUS ABOUT DIFFERENT 
BUSINESS FORMS?
Are you curious about the differences among a sole proprietorship, a partnership, and 
a corporation? A sole proprietorship is formed automatically in most states and in most 
industries when an individual decides to go into business. In many jurisdictions, the sole 
proprietor needs to acquire or apply for a business license from the state or local city 
government. Other than clearing that modest hurdle, sole proprietorship requires no 
special prerequisites.
A partnership is formed automatically when two or more people enter into a joint busi-
ness or investment activity for the purpose of making a profit. As is the case with a sole 
proprietorship, partnerships typically need to acquire a business license from the state 
and perhaps the federal government. Partnership formation doesn’t necessarily require 
any additional paperwork or legal maneuvering. If you do enter into a partnership, 
however, most attorneys (probably all attorneys) will tell you that you do so at a certain 
amount of risk if you don’t have an attorney draw up a partnership agreement that out-
lines the duties, rights, and responsibilities of the partners. Also be aware that you can 
actually form a partnership simply by collaborating in business with someone. The law 
books are full of stories of people who inadvertently created partnerships merely by col-
laborating on some project, sharing office space, or working together on some activity.
By comparison, most states allow several other business forms, including corporations, 
limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. These other business forms 
sometimes require considerably more work to set up, sometimes the assistance of 
a good attorney or accountant, and sometimes payment of several hundred — and 
possibly several thousand — dollars in legal and licensing fees. The unique feature of 
most of these other business forms is that the corporation, limited liability company, or 
limited liability partnership becomes a separate legal entity. In many cases, this sepa-
rate legal entity protects investors from creditors that have a claim on the assets of the 
business. By comparison, in a sole proprietorship or a partnership, the sole proprietor 
and the partners are liable for the debts and obligations of the proprietorship or the 
­partnership.
If you have questions about the correct business form in which to operate, talk with a 
good local attorney or accountant. He or she can assist you in choosing the appropriate 
business form and in considering both the legal and tax aspects of choosing a particular 
form. As a general rule, more sophisticated business forms such as corporations, lim-
ited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships deliver significant legal and tax 
benefits to investors and managers. Unfortunately, these more sophisticated business 
forms also require considerably more legal and accounting fiddle-faddling.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      23
Let me add a tangential but important point: QuickBooks supplies all this account-
ing information. For the most part, preparing these sorts of financial statements 
in QuickBooks is pretty darn easy. But first, you’ll find it helpful to know a bit 
more about accounting and bookkeeping. I go over that information in the coming 
chapters. Also, note that the big-picture stuff covered in this chapter is the most 
important knowledge that you need. If you understand the ideas described in this 
chapter, the battle is more than half won.
The Philosophy of Accounting
Maybe the phrase philosophy of accounting is too strong, but accounting does rest 
on a rather small set of fundamental assumptions and principles. People often 
refer to these fundamentals as generally accepted accounting principles.
I want to quickly summarize what these principles are. I find — and I bet you’ll 
find the same thing — that understanding the principles provides context and 
makes accounting practices more understandable. With this in mind, let me go 
through the half dozen or so key accounting principles and assumptions.
These basic accounting principles underlie business accounting. These principles 
and assumptions are implicit in all the discussions in this entire book. It’s no 
exaggeration to say that they permeate almost everything related to business 
accounting.
Revenue principle
The revenue principle, also known as the realization principle, states that revenue is 
earned when the sale is made. Typically, the sale is made when goods or services 
are provided. A key component of the revenue principle, when it comes to the sale 
of goods, is that revenue is earned when legal ownership of the goods passes from 
seller to buyer.
Note that revenue isn’t earned when you collect cash for something. It turns out, 
perhaps counterintuitively, that counting revenue when cash is collected doesn’t 
give the business owner a good idea of what sales really are. Some customers may 
pay deposits early, before actually receiving the goods or services. Often, custom-
ers want to use trade credit, paying a firm at some point in the future for goods or 
services. Because cash flows can fluctuate wildly — even something like a delay in 
the mail can affect cash flow — you don’t want to use cash collection from cus-
tomers as a measure of sales. Besides, you can easily track cash collections from 
customers. So why not have the extra information about when sales actually occur?

24      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Expense principle
The expense principle states that an expense occurs when the business uses goods 
or receives services. In other words, the expense principle is the flip side of the 
revenue principle. As is the case with the revenue principle, if you receive some 
goods, simply receiving the goods means that you’ve incurred the expense of the 
goods. Similarly, if you’ve received some service — services from your lawyer, for 
example — you’ve incurred the expense. It doesn’t matter that your lawyer takes 
a few days or a few weeks to send you the bill. You incur an expense when goods 
or services are received.
Matching principle
The matching principle is related to the revenue and expense principles. The match-
ing principle states that when you recognize revenue, you should match related 
expenses with the revenue. The best example of the matching principle concerns 
the case of businesses that resell inventory. In the hot-dog-stand example, you 
should count the expense of a hot dog and the expense of a bun on the day when 
you sell that hot dog and that bun. Don’t count the expense when you buy the buns 
and the dogs. Count the expense when you sell them. In other words, match the 
expense of the item with the revenue of the item.
Accrual-based accounting, which is a term you’ve probably heard, is what you get 
when you apply the revenue principle, the expense principle, and the matching 
principle. In a nutshell, accrual-based accounting means that you record revenue 
when a sale is made and record expenses when goods are used or services are 
received.
Cost principle
The cost principle states that amounts in your accounting system should be quanti-
fied, or measured, by using historical cost. If you have a business and the business 
owns a building, that building — according to the cost principle — shows up on 
your balance sheet at its historical cost. You don’t adjust the values in an account-
ing system for changes in a fair market value. You use the original historical costs.
I should admit that the cost principle is occasionally violated in a couple of ways. 
The cost principle is adjusted through the application of depreciation, which I 
discuss in Book 1, Chapter 3. Also, sometimes fair market values are used to value 
assets, but only when assets are worth less than they cost.

Principles of Accounting
CHAPTER 1  Principles of Accounting      25
Objectivity principle
The objectivity principle states that accounting measurements and accounting 
reports should use objective, factual, and verifiable data. In other words, accoun-
tants, accounting systems, and accounting reports should rely on subjectivity as 
little as possible.
An accountant always wants to use objective data (even if it’s bad) rather than 
subjective data (even if the subjective data is arguably better). The idea is that 
objectivity provides protection from the corrupting influence that subjectivity can 
introduce into a firm’s accounting records.
Continuity assumption
The continuity assumption — accountants call it an assumption rather than a prin-
ciple for reasons unknown to me — states that accounting systems assume that 
a business will continue to operate. The importance of the continuity assumption 
becomes clear if you consider the ramifications of assuming that a business won’t 
continue. If a business won’t continue, it becomes very unclear how one should 
value assets if the assets have no resale value. This sounds like gobbledygook, but 
think about the implicit continuity assumption built in to the balance sheet for the 
hot dog stand at the beginning of the day. (This is the balance sheet that shows up 
in Table 1-4 earlier in this chapter.)
Implicit in that balance sheet is the assumption that hot dogs and hot dog buns 
have some value because they can be sold. If a business won’t continue opera-
tions, no assurance exists that any of the inventory can be sold. If the inventory 
can’t be sold, what does that say about the owner’s equity value shown in the 
balance sheet?
You can see, I hope, the sorts of accounting problems that you get into without the 
assumption that the business will continue to operate.
Unit-of-measure assumption
The unit-of-measure assumption assumes that a business’s domestic currency is 
the appropriate unit of measure for the business to use in its accounting. In other 
words, the unit-of-measure assumption states that it’s okay for US ­businesses 
to use US dollars in their accounting, and it’s okay for UK businesses to use 
pounds sterling as the unit of measure in their accounting system. The unit-of- 
measure assumption also states, implicitly, that even though inflation and occa-
sionally deflation change the purchasing power of the unit of measure used in the 
accounting system, that’s still okay. Sure, inflation and deflation foul up some of 

26      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
the numbers in a firm’s financial statements. But the unit-of-measure assump-
tion says that’s usually okay — especially in light of the fact that no better alter-
natives exist.
Separate-entity assumption
The separate-entity assumption states that a business entity, like a sole propri-
etorship, is a separate entity, a separate thing from its business owner. Also, the 
separate-entity assumption says that a partnership is a separate thing from the 
partners who own part of the business. This assumption, therefore, enables one to 
prepare financial statements just for the sole proprietorship or just for the part-
nership. As a result, the separate-entity assumption also relies on a business to be 
separate, distinct, and definable compared with its business owners.
A Few Words about Tax Accounting
I’m not going to talk much about tax accounting or tax preparation in this book, 
but one of the key reasons why you do accounting and use a program such as 
QuickBooks is to make your tax accounting easier. That’s obvious. So a fair ques-
tion is this: How does what I’ve said so far relate to income tax return preparation?
This question is a tough one to answer. Tax laws typically don’t map to generally 
accepted accounting principles. Generally accepted accounting principles aren’t 
the same thing as income tax law. If you use good basic accounting practices as 
you operate QuickBooks, however, you get financial information that you can use 
to easily prepare your tax returns, especially if you get some help from your certi-
fied public accountant (CPA).
If you want, you can also use income tax rules to fine-tune your accounting and 
bookkeeping. This practice, which is technically known as an other comprehensive 
basis of accounting (OCBOA), is generally considered to be an appropriate way to 
perform accounting for small and medium-size enterprises.

CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      27
Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
T
he preceding chapter describes why businesses create financial statements 
and how these financial statements can be used. If you’ve read Book 1, 
Chapter 1, or if you’ve spent much time managing a business, you prob-
ably know what you need to know about financial statements. In truth, financial 
statements are pretty straightforward. An income statement, for example, shows 
a firm’s revenue, expenses, and profits. A balance sheet itemizes a firm’s assets, 
liabilities, and owner’s equity. So far, so good.
Unfortunately, preparing traditional financial statements is more complicated 
and tedious. The work of preparing financial statements — called accounting or 
bookkeeping — requires either a whole bunch of fiddle-faddling with numbers or 
learning how to use double-entry bookkeeping.
In this chapter, I start by describing the fiddle-faddle method. This isn’t because 
I think you should use that method. In fact, I assume that you eventually want to 
use QuickBooks for your accounting and, by extension, for double-entry book-
keeping. But if you understand the fiddle-faddle method, you’ll clearly see why 
double-entry bookkeeping is so much better.
After I describe the fiddle-faddle method, I walk you through the steps to using 
and understanding double-entry bookkeeping. After you see all the anguish and

grief that the fiddle-faddle method causes, you should have no trouble appreciat-
ing why double-entry bookkeeping works so much better. And I hope you’ll also 
commit to the 30 or 40 minutes necessary to learn the basics of double-entry 
bookkeeping.
The Fiddle-Faddle Method of Accounting
Most small businesses — or at least those small businesses whose owners aren’t 
already trained in accounting — have used the fiddle-faddle method. Take a peek 
at the financial statements shown in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. If you’ve read or reviewed 
Book 1, Chapter 1, you may recognize that these financial statements stem from 
the imaginary hot-dog-stand business. Table 2-1 shows the income statement 
for the one day a year that the imaginary business operates. Table 2-2 shows the 
balance sheet at the start of the first day of operation.

CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      29
With the fiddle-faddle method of accounting, you individually calculate each 
number shown in the financial statement. The sales revenue figure shown in 
Table 2-1, for example, equals $13,000. The fiddle-faddle method of accounting 
requires you to somehow come up with this sales revenue number manually. You 
may be able to come up with this number by remembering each of the sales that 
you made during the day. Or, if you prepare invoices or sales receipts, you may be 
able to come up with this number by adding all the individual sales. If you have a 
cash register, you may also be able to come up with this number by looking at the 
cash register tape.
Other revenue and expense numbers get calculated in the same crude manner. The 
$1,000 of rent expense, for example, gets calculated by either remembering what 
amount you paid for rent or by looking in your checkbook register and finding the 
check that you wrote for rent.
The balance sheet values get produced in roughly the same way. You can deduce 
the cash balance of $1,000, for example, by looking at the checkbook or, in a 
worst-case scenario, the bank statement. You can deduce the inventory balance 
of $3,000 by adding the individual inventory item values. You can calculate the 
liability and owner’s equity amounts in similar fashion.
Some of the values shown in an income statement or on a balance sheet get 
plugged — meaning that they’re calculated by using other numbers from the 
financial statement. You don’t look up the profit amount in any particular place; 
instead, you calculate profit by subtracting expenses from revenue. You can also 
calculate balance sheet values such as total assets, owner’s equity, and total lia-
bilities, of course.
Okay, I admit it: The fiddle-faddle method of accounting works reasonably well 
for a very small business as long as you have a good checkbook. So for a very 
small business, you may be able to get away with this crude, piecemeal approach 
to accounting.

Unfortunately, the fiddle-faddle method suffers the three horrible weaknesses for 
a firm that doesn’t have super-simple finances:
»
» It’s not systematic enough to be automated. Now, admittedly, you may not 
care that the fiddle-faddle approach isn’t systematic enough for automation. 
But this point is an important one: A systematic approach like double-entry 
bookkeeping can be automated, as you can do with QuickBooks. This 
automation means that the task of preparing financial statements requires — 
oh, I don’t know — maybe five mouse clicks. Because the fiddle-faddle 
approach can’t be automated, every time you want to produce financial 
statements, you or some poor co-worker must do an enormous amount of 
work to collect the numbers and all the raw data necessary to produce 
information like that shown in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2. In reality, of course, 
with more complicated financial statements, someone does much, much 
more work.
»
» It’s very easy to lose details. This sounds abstract, but let me give you a 
good, concrete example. If you look at Table 2-1, you see that the hot dog 
stand incurs only three operating expenses: rent, wages, and supplies. If you 
know the operating expense categories that the business incurs, it’s fairly easy 
to look through the check register and find the check or checks that pay rent, 
for example. You can use a similar approach with the wages and supplies 
expenses. But what if you also have an advertising expense category, a 
business license expense, or some other easy-to-forget category? If you forget 
a category, you miss expenses. If you forget that you spent money advertising 
and, thereby, forget to tally your advertising expenses, that whole category of 
operating expense gets omitted from your income statement.
»
» It doesn’t allow rigorous error checking. This business about error checking 
may seem to be nitpicky, but error checking is important with accounting and 
bookkeeping systems. With all the numbers and transactions floating around, 
errors easily creep into the system. I discuss error checking more later in this 
chapter, but let me give you an example of the sort of error checking an 
accounting system can (and should) perform. Take a look at the example of 
the sales transaction. If you sell an item for $1,000, you can actually check that 
amount by comparing it with your record of what the customer paid. This 
makes sense, right? If you sell me an item for $1,000, you should be able to 
compare that $1,000 sale with the amount of cash that I pay you. A $1,000 
sale to me should correspond to a $1,000 cash payment from me. The 
fiddle-faddle method can’t make these comparisons, but double-entry 
bookkeeping can.

Double-Entry

CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      31
You see where I am now, right? I’ve admitted that you can construct financial 
statements by using the fiddle-faddle method. But I hope I’ve also convinced 
you that the fiddle-faddle method suffers some really debilitating weak­­
­nesses. I’m talking about something as important as how you can best manage  
the financial affairs of your business. These weaknesses indicate that you  
need a better tool. Specifically, you need double-entry bookkeeping, which I 
­discuss next.
How Double-Entry Bookkeeping Works
After you conclude that the fiddle-faddle method is for the birds, you’re ready to 
absorb the necessary accounting theory and learn the bookkeeping tricks required 
to employ double-entry bookkeeping. Essentially, you need two things to work 
with double-entry bookkeeping: an understanding of the accounting model and a 
grasp of the mechanics of debits and credits. Neither of these things is difficult. If 
you flip ahead a few pages, you can see that I’m going to spend only a few pages 
talking about this material. How difficult can anything be that can be described in 
just a few pages? Not very, right?
The accounting model
Here’s the first thing to understand and internalize to use double-entry book-
keeping: Modern accounting uses an accounting model that says assets equal 
liabilities plus owner’s equity. The following formula expresses this in a more 
conventional, algebraic form:
assets = liabilities + owner’s equity
If you think about this for a moment and flip back to Table 2-2, you see that this 
formula summarizes the organization of a business’s balance sheet. Conceptually, 
the formula says that a business owns stuff and that the money or the funds for 
that stuff comes either from creditors (such as the bank or some vendor) or the 
owners (either in the form of original contributed capital or perhaps in reinvested 
profits). If you understand the balance sheet shown in Table 2-2 and discussed 
here, you understand the first core principle of double-entry bookkeeping. This 
isn’t that tough so far, is it?
Here’s the second thing to understand about the basic accounting model: Revenue 
increases owner’s equity, and expenses decrease owner’s equity. Think about that 

32      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
for a minute. That makes intuitive sense. If you receive $1,000 in cash from a cus-
tomer, you have $1,000 more in the business. If you write a $1,000 check to pay a 
bill, you have $1,000 less in the business.
Another way to say the same thing is that profits clearly add to owner’s equity. 
Profits get reinvested in the business and boost owner’s equity. Profits are cal-
culated as the difference between revenue and expenses. If revenue exceeds 
expenses, profits exist.
Let me review where I am so far in this discussion about the basic accounting 
model. The basic model says that assets equal liabilities plus owner’s equity. In 
other words, the total assets of a firm equal the total of its liabilities and owner’s 
equity. Furthermore, revenue increases owner’s equity, and expenses decrease 
owner’s equity.
At this point, you don’t have to intuitively understand the logic of the accounting 
model and the way that revenues and expenses plug into the owner’s equity of the 
model. If you do get it, that’s great but not necessary. But you do need to memo-
rize or remember (for at least the next few paragraphs) the manner in which the 
basic model works.
This point may seem to be redundant, but note that a balance sheet is constructed 
by using information about a firm’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. Simi-
larly, note that a firm’s income statement is constructed by using information 
about its revenue and its expenses. All this discussion — all this tediousness — 
is really about how you collect the information necessary to produce an income 
statement and a balance sheet.
Now I come to perhaps the most important point to understand to get double-
entry bookkeeping. Every transaction and every economic event that occurs in 
the life of a firm produces two effects: an increase in some account shown in the 
balance sheet or income statement and a decrease in some account shown in 
the balance sheet or income statement. When something happens, economically 
speaking, that something affects at least two types of information shown in the 
financial statement. In the next few paragraphs, I give you some examples so you 
can really understand this concept.
Suppose that in your business, you sell $1,000 worth of an item for $1,000 in cash. 
In the case of this transaction or economic event, two things occur from the per-
spective of your financial statements:

Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      33
»
» Your cash increases by $1,000.
»
» Your sales revenue increases by $1,000.
Another way to say this same thing is that your $1,000 cash sale affects both your 
balance sheet (because cash increases) and your income statement (because sales 
revenue is earned).
See the duality? And just a paragraph ago, you were thinking this might be too 
complicated for you, weren’t you?
Here’s another common example: Suppose that you buy $1,000 worth of inven-
tory for cash. In this case, you decrease your cash balance by $1,000, but you 
increase your inventory balance by $1,000. Note that in this case, both effects of 
the transaction appear in sort of the same area of your financial statement: the list 
of assets. Nevertheless, this transaction also affects two accounts.
When I use the word account, I simply mean some value that appears in your 
income statement or on your balance sheet. If you look at Tables 2-1 and 2-2, for 
example, any value that appears in those financial statements that isn’t simply 
a calculation represents an account. In essence, an account tracks some group of 
assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, contributions, revenue, or expenses. I talk more 
about accounts in the next section, where I get to the actual mechanics of double-
entry bookkeeping.
Here’s another example that shows this duality of effects in an economic event: 
Suppose that you spend $1,000 in cash on advertising. In this case, this economic 
event reduces cash by $1,000 and increases the advertising expense amount by 
$1,000. This economic event affects both the assets portion of the balance sheet 
and the operating expenses portion of the income statement.
And now — believe it or not — you’re ready to see how the mechanics of double-
entry bookkeeping work.
Talking mechanics
Roughly 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Luca Pacioli devised a systematic 
approach to keeping track of the increases and decreases in account balances. He 
said that increases in asset and expense accounts should be called debits, whereas 
decreases in asset and expense accounts should be called credits. He also said that 
increases in liabilities, owner’s equity, and revenue accounts should be called 
credits, whereas decreases in liabilities, owner’s equity, and revenue accounts 
should be called debits.

Table 2-3 summarizes the information that I just shared. Unfortunately — and 
you can’t get around this fact — you need to memorize this table or dog-ear the 
page so you can refer to it easily.
In Pacioli’s debits-and-credits system, any transaction can be described as a set 
of balancing debits and credits. This system not only works as financial short-
hand, but also provides error checking. To get a better idea of how it works, look 
at some simple examples.
Take the case of a $1,000 cash sale. By using Pacioli’s system or by using double-
entry bookkeeping, you can record this transaction as shown here:
Cash
$1,000
Debit
Sales revenue
$1,000
Credit
See how that works? The $1,000 cash sale appears as both a debit to cash (which 
means an increase in cash) and a $1,000 credit to sales (which means a $1,000 
increase in sales revenue). Debits equal credits, and that’s no accident. The 
accounting model and Pacioli’s assignment of debits and credits mean that any 
correctly recorded transaction balances. For a correctly recorded transaction, the 
transaction’s debits equal the transaction’s credits.
Although you can show transactions as I’ve just shown the $1,000 cash sale, 
you and I may just as well use the more orthodox nomenclature. By convention, 
accountants and bookkeepers show transactions, or what accountants and book-
keepers call journal entries, like the one shown in Table 2-4.

Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      35
See how that works? Each account that’s affected by a transaction appears on  
a separate line. Debits appear in the left column. Credits appear in the right 
column.
You actually already understand how this account business works. You have a 
checkbook. You use it to keep track of both the balance in your checking account 
and the transactions that change the checking account balance. The rules of  
double-entry bookkeeping essentially say that you’re going to use a similar 
record-keeping system not only for your cash account, but also for every other 
account you need to prepare your financial statements.
Here are a couple of other examples of how this transaction recording works. In 
the first part of this discussion of how double-entry bookkeeping works, I describe 
two other transactions: purchasing $1,000 of inventory for cash and spending 
$1,000 in cash on advertising. Table 2-5 shows how the purchase of $1,000 of 
inventory for cash appears. Table  2-6 shows how spending $1,000 of cash on 
advertising appears.

By tallying the debits and credits to an account, you can calculate the account 
balance. Suppose that before journal entries 1, 2, and 3, the cash balance equals 
$2,000. Journal Entry 1 increases cash by $1,000 (the debit). Journal Entries 2 and 
3 decrease cash by $1,000 each (the $2,000 credits). If you combine all these entries, 
you get the new account balance. The following formula shows the calculation:
Beginning balance of cash
$2,000
Plus cash debit from Journal Entry 1
$1,000
Minus cash credit from Journal Entry 2
–$1,000

THAT DARN BANK
When I learned about double-entry bookkeeping, I stumbled over the terms debit and 
credit. The way I’d heard the terms used before didn’t agree with the way that double-
entry bookkeeping seemed to describe them. This conflict caused a certain amount 
of confusion for me. Because I don’t want you to suffer the same fate, let me quickly 
describe my initial confusion.
If you look at Table 2-3, you see that an increase in an asset account is a debit and 
a decrease in an asset account is a credit. This means that in the case of your cash 
account, increases to cash are debits and decreases to cash are credits.
At some time, however, you’ve undoubtedly talked to the bank and heard someone 
refer to crediting your bank account — which meant increasing the account balance. 
And perhaps that someone talked about debiting your account — which meant decreas-
ing the account balance. So what’s up with that? Am I wrong, and is the bank right?
Actually, both the bank and I are right. Here’s why. The bank is talking about debiting and 
crediting — not a cash account and not an asset account, but a liability account. To the bank, 
the money that you’ve placed in the account is not cash (an asset) but a liability (money that 
the bank owes you). If you look at Table 2-3, you see that increases in a liability are credit 
amounts and decreases in a liability are debit amounts. Therefore, from the bank’s per-
spective, when the bank increases the balance in your account, that increase is a credit.
Your assets may represent another firm’s liabilities. Your liabilities will represent 
another firm’s assets. Therefore, whenever you hear some other business talking about 
crediting or debiting your account, what you do is exactly the opposite. If the business 
credits, you debit. If the business debits, you credit.

Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      37
Do you see how that works? You start with $2,000 as the cash account balance. The 
first cash debit of $1,000 increases the cash balance to $3,000 and then the cash 
credit of $1,000 in Journal Entry 2 decreases the cash balance to $2,000. Finally, 
the cash credit of $1,000 in journal entry 3 decreases the cash balance to $1,000.
You can calculate the account balance for any account by taking the starting 
account balance and then adding the debits and credits that have occurred since 
then. By hand, this arithmetic is a little unwieldy. Your computer (with the help of 
QuickBooks) does this math easily.
Almost a Real-Life Example
To cement the concepts that I talk about in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, 
I want to quickly step through the journal entries, or bookkeeping transactions, that 
you would record in the case of the hot-dog-stand business discussed in the preceding 
chapter. To start, you need to know that the balance sheet shown in Table 2-2 is the 
balance sheet at the start of the day. This means that the account balances in all 
the accounts appear as shown in Table 2-7. This list of account balances is actually 
called a trial balance. It shows the debit or credit balance for each account.
I’m assuming that no year-to-date revenue or expenses exist yet for the hot dog 
stand business. In other words, the operation is just at a starting period.
You may want to take a quick peek at Table 2-1, shown earlier. It summarizes the 
business activities of the hot dog stand. The journal entries that follow show how 
the information necessary for this statement would be recorded.

Recording rent expense
Suppose that the first transaction to record is a $1,000 check written to pay rent. 
In this case, the journal entry appears as shown in Table 2-8. In this example, 
$1,000 is debited to rent expense, and $1,000 is credited to cash.
Recording wages expense
If you need to record $4,000 of wages expense, you use the journal entry shown 
in Table 2-9. This journal entry debits wages expense for $4,000 and credits cash 
for $4,000. In other words, you use $4,000 of cash to pay wages for the hot-dog- 
stand business.
Recording supplies expense
To record $1,000 of supplies expense paid for by writing a check, you record the 
journal entry shown in Table 2-10. This transaction debits supplies expense for 
$1,000 and credits cash for $1,000.

Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      39
Note that for each of the preceding transactions, debits equal credits. As long as 
debits equal credits, you know that the transaction is in balance. This balance is 
one of the ways that double-entry bookkeeping prevents errors.
Recording sales revenue
Suppose that you sell $13,000 worth of hot dogs. To record this transaction in a 
journal entry, you debit cash for $13,000 and credit sales revenue for $13,000, as 
shown in Table 2-11. I should tell you, however, that in the case of the hot dog stand 
selling hot dogs for a dollar or two apiece, you wouldn’t necessarily use a single 
journal entry to record sales revenue amounts. Though you could use a single jour-
nal entry that tallied the entire day’s sales, if you’re selling hot dogs at a dollar a 
dog, you could also record 13,000 one-dollar transactions. Each of these one-dollar 
transactions debits cash for a dollar and credits sales revenue for a dollar.
Recording cost of goods sold
You must record the expense of the hot dogs and buns that you sell. You must also 
record the fact that if you use up your inventory of hot dogs and buns, your inven-
tory balance has decreased. Table 2-12 shows how you record this. Cost of goods 
sold gets debited for $3,000, and inventory gets credited for $3,000.
If you’re confused about this cost-of-goods-sold transaction — it represents the 
first transaction that doesn’t use cash — read Book 1, Chapter 1, where I describe 
the two accounting principles. In short, these two principles go like this:
»
» Expense principle: This principle says that an expense gets counted when the 
item gets sold. This means that the inventory isn’t counted as cost of goods

sold or as an expense when it’s purchased. Rather, the expense of the hot dog 
and bun that you sell gets counted when the item is actually sold to somebody.
»
» Matching principle: This principle says that expenses or cost of a sale get 
matched with the revenue of the sale. This means that you recognize the cost 
of goods sold at the same time that you recognize the sale. Typically, in fact, 
you can combine journal entries 7 and 8.
Another way to think about the information recorded in journal entry 8 is this:  
Rather than “spend” cash to provide customers hot dogs and buns, you spend 
inventory.
Recording the payoff of accounts payable
Suppose that one of the things you do at the end of the day is write a check to 
pay off the accounts payable. The accounts payable are the amounts that you owe  
vendors — probably the suppliers from which you purchased the hot dogs and 
buns. To record the payoff of accounts payable, you debit accounts payable for 
$2,000 and credit cash for $2,000, as shown in Table 2-13.
Recording the payoff of a loan
Suppose also that you use cash profits from the day to pay off the $1,000 loan that 
the balance sheet shows (see Table 2-2). To record this transaction, you debit loan 
payable for $1,000 and credit cash for $1,000, as shown in Table 2-14.

CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      41
Calculating account balance
You may already be able to guess this: If you know an account’s starting balance 
and have a way to add up the debits and the credits to the account, you can easily 
calculate the ending account balance.
Take the case of the cash account balance of the hot-dog-stand business. If you 
look at the balance sheet shown in Table 2-2, you see that the beginning balance 
for cash is $1,000. You can easily construct a little schedule of how the account 
balance changes — this is called a T-account — that calculates the ending balance. 
(In case you are wondering, a T-account is a visual aid to help in accounting. You 
start by drawing a big capital T, with debits on the left side and credits on the 
right side). In fact, Table 2-15 does just this. If you look closely at Table 2-15, you 
see that the cash beginning balance is $1,000. Then, on the following lines of the 
T-account, you see the effects of Journal Entries 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Some of these 
journal entries credit cash. Some of them debit cash. You can calculate the ending 
cash balance by combining the debit and credit amounts.
The information shown in Table 2-15 should make sense to you. But just in case 
you’re still trying to memorize what debits and credits mean, I’m going to give 
you a bit more detail. To calculate the ending balance shown in Table 2-15, you 
add up the debits, add up the credits, and combine the two sums. The net amount 
in the cash account equals the $5,000 debit. If you recall from the preceding para-
graphs, a debit balance in an asset account, such as cash, represents a positive 
amount. A $5,000 debit balance in the cash account, therefore, indicates that you 
have $5,000 of cash in the account.

42      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Cash is usually the trickiest account to analyze with a T-account because so many 
journal entries affect cash. In many cases, however, a T-account analysis of an 
account balance is much more straightforward. If you look at Table 2-16, you see a 
T-account analysis of the inventory account. This T-account analysis shows that 
the beginning inventory account balance equals $3,000. But when journal entry 
8 credits inventory for $3,000 — this is the journal entry that records the cost of 
goods sold — the inventory balance is wiped out.
Paying off the accounts payable and loan payable accounts is similarly straightfor-
ward. Table 2-17 shows the T-account analysis of the accounts payable account. 
Table  2-18 shows the T-account analysis of the loan payable account. In both 
cases, the T-account analysis shows that the liability accounts start with a credit 
beginning balance. (Remember that a liability account would have a credit balance 
if the firm really owed money.) Then, when the payments are recorded to pay off 
the accounts payable and loan payable in Journal Entries 9 and 10, the liability 
account is debited. The result, in the case of both accounts, is that the liability 
account balance is reduced to zero.

Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      43
I’m not going to show T-account analyses of the other accounts that the preced-
ing journal entries use. In every other case, the only debit or credit to the account 
comes from the journal entry, which means that the journal entry amount is the 
account balance. Only one journal entry affects the sales revenue account: Jour-
nal Entry 7, which credits sales revenue for $13,000. Because the sales revenue 
account has no beginning balance, that $13,000 credit equals the sales revenue 
account balance. The expense accounts work the same way.
Using T-account analysis results
If you construct (or your accounting program constructs) T-accounts for each 
balance sheet and income statement account, you can easily calculate account 
balances at a particular point in time by using the T-account analysis results. 
Table 2-19 shows a trial balance at the end of the day for the hot-dog-stand 
business. You can calculate each of these account balances by using T-account 
analysis.
The first line shown in the trial balance in Table 2-19 is the cash account, with 
a debit balance of $5,000. This debit account balance comes from the T-account 
analysis shown in Table 2-15. The account balances for inventory, accounts pay-
able, and loan payable also come from the T-account analyses shown previously 
in this chapter (Tables 2-16, 2-17, and 2-18).

As I note in the preceding section, you don’t need to perform T-account analyses 
for the other accounts shown in the trial balance provided in Table 2-19. These 
other accounts show a single debit or credit.
I need to make one final and perhaps already-obvious point: The information 
provided in Table 2-19 is the information necessary to construct an income state-
ment for the day and a balance sheet as of the end of the day. If you take sales 
revenue, cost of goods sold, rent, wages expense, and supplies expense from the 
trial balance, you have all the information that you need to construct an income 
statement for the day. In fact, the information shown in Table 2-19 is the infor-
mation used to construct the income statement shown in Table 2-1.
Similarly, the asset, liability, and owner’s equity balance information shown in 
the trial balance provided in Table  2-19 supplies the information necessary to 
construct a balance sheet as of the end of the day.
The end-of-day balance sheet won’t actually balance unless you also include 
the profits of the day. These profits, called retained earnings or lumped into the 
owner’s capital account, equal $4,000. You can see what this end-of-day balance 
sheet looks like by reading Book 1, Chapter 1. In that chapter, Table 1-7 shows the 
end-of-day balance sheet for the hot-dog-stand business.
A Few Words about How  
QuickBooks Works
Before I end this chapter, I want to make just a few comments about how Quick-
Books helps you. First of all  — and this may be the most important point  — 
QuickBooks makes most of these journal entries for you. In Journal Entry 6, for 
example, I show you how to record a $1,000 check written to pay supplies, but 
you’d never have to make this journal entry in QuickBooks. When you use Quick-
Books to record a $1,000 check that pays Acme Supplies for some paper products 
that you purchased, QuickBooks automatically debits supplies expense (as long as 
you indicate that the check is for supplies) and then credits cash.
Similarly, in the case of journal Entries 7 and 8, when you produce an invoice that 
records a sale, QuickBooks makes these journal entries for you. If you sold $13,000 
worth of hot dogs and buns, and those hot dogs and buns actually cost you $3,000, 
QuickBooks debits cash for $13,000, credits sales revenue for $13,000, debits cost 
of goods sold for $3,000, and credits inventory for $3,000. In other words, for 
most of your routine transactions, QuickBooks handles the journal entries for you 
behind the scenes.

Double-Entry 
Bookkeeping
CHAPTER 2  Double-Entry Bookkeeping      45
This doesn’t mean, however, that you can always avoid working with journal 
entries. Any transaction that can’t be handled through a standard QuickBooks 
form — such as the Invoice form or the Write Checks form — must be recorded 
by using a journal entry. If you purchase some fixed asset by writing a check, 
for example, the purchase of the fixed asset gets recorded automatically by 
QuickBooks. But the depreciation that will be used to expense the asset over its 
estimated economic life — something I talk a bit about in the next chapter —  
must be recorded with journal entries that you construct yourself and enter a 
different way.
One other really important point: I note in the preceding paragraphs that the trial 
balance information shown in Table 2-19 provides the raw data that you need to 
prepare your financial statement. I don’t want to leave you with a misunderstand-
ing, however. You don’t actually have to take this sort of raw data and prepare 
your financial statements. Predictably, QuickBooks easily, quickly, and effort-
lessly builds your financial statements by using this trial balance information.
Just to put these comments together, then, QuickBooks automatically creates 
most journal entries for you, builds a trial balance by using journal entry infor-
mation, and — when asked — produces financial statements. Most of the work 
of double-entry bookkeeping, then, goes on behind the scenes. You don’t worry 
about many journal entries on a day-to-day basis. And if you don’t want to ever 
see a trial balance, you don’t have to. In fact, if you just use QuickBooks to produce 
invoices and to write checks that pay the bills, almost all the information that you 
need to prepare your financial statements gets collected automatically. So that’s 
really neat.
Not all the information that’s necessary for producing good, accurate financial 
statements gets collected automatically, however. You’ll encounter a handful of 
important cases that should be handled on a special basis through journal entries 
that you or your CPA must construct and enter.

Special Accounting 
Problems
E
ven if you understand the principles of accounting (which I describe in Book 1, 
Chapter  1) and the basics of double-entry bookkeeping (which I  describe 
in Book 1, Chapter 2), you still may not have all the information that you 
need to keep good records. Tracking the amounts that customers owe you and 
the amounts that you owe vendors can be a bit tricky, for example. Inventory can 
also present challenging record-keeping problems — a fact that’s not surprising 
to you as a retailer. And things like fixed assets — oh, don’t even get me started.
For these reasons, this chapter describes the most common complexities that 
business owners confront. You don’t need to be an accountant or an experienced 
bookkeeper to understand the material in this chapter. You do need to proceed 
carefully, take your time, and think a bit about how the material I describe here 
applies to your specific business situation.

Working with Accounts Receivable
If you read Book 1, Chapter 1, you already know that accounting principles state 
that sales revenue needs to be recognized when a sale is made and that the sale is 
made when a business provides goods or services to a customer.
In other words — and this point is really important — sales revenue doesn’t get 
recorded when you receive payment from a customer. Sales revenue gets recorded 
when a customer has a legal obligation to pay you because you have (or your busi-
ness has) provided the customer the goods or services.
Recording a sale
This requirement to record sales revenue at the time that goods or services are 
provided means that accounting for sales revenue is slightly more complicated 
than you may have first guessed. The first transaction  — the transaction that 
records a sale — is shown in Table 3-1.
Journal Entry 1 shows how a $1,000 sale may be recorded. The journal entry shows 
a $1,000 debit to accounts receivable (sometimes abbreviated A/R) and a $1,000 
credit to sales revenue. To record a $1,000 sale — a credit sale — the journal entry 
needs to show both the $1,000 increase in accounts receivable and the $1,000 
increase in sales revenue.
Recording a payment
When the business receives payment from the customer for the $1,000 receivable, 
the business records a journal entry like that shown in Table 3-2.

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      49
Journal Entry 2 shows a $1,000 debit to cash, which is the $1,000 increase in the 
cash account that occurs because the customer has just paid you $1,000. Jour-
nal Entry 2 also shows a $1,000 credit to accounts receivable. This credit to the 
accounts receivable asset account reduces the accounts receivable balance.
At the point when you record Journal Entries 1 and 2, the net effect is a $1,000 debit 
to cash (showing that the cash has increased by $1,000) and a $1,000 credit to sales 
revenue (showing that sales revenue has increased by $1,000). The $1,000 debit to 
accounts receivable and the $1,000 credit to accounts receivable net to zero.
If you think about this accounts receivable business a bit, you should realize that it 
makes sense. Although the accounts receivable account includes a $1,000 receiv-
able balance, this just means that the customer owes you $1,000. But when the 
customer finally pays off the $1,000 bill, you need to zero out that receivable.
QuickBooks, by the way, automatically records Journal Entries 1 and 2 for you. Jour-
nal Entry 1 gets recorded whenever you issue or create a customer invoice. There-
fore, you don’t need to worry about the debits and credits shown in Journal Entry 1 
except for one special occasion: When you set up QuickBooks and QuickBooks items, 
you do specify which account should be credited to track sales revenue. So although 
you may not need to worry much about the mechanics of Journal Entry 1, you should 
understand how this journal entry works so that you can set up QuickBooks cor-
rectly. (Book 2, Chapter 1 describes the mechanics of setting up QuickBooks.)
Items are things that get included in the invoices.
Journal Entry 2 also gets recorded automatically by QuickBooks. QuickBooks records 
Journal Entry 2 for you whenever you record a cash payment from a customer. You 
don’t need to worry, then, about the debits and credits necessary for recording 
customer payments. I find that it’s helpful, however, to understand how this jour-
nal entry works and how QuickBooks records this customer payment transaction.
Estimating bad-debt expense
One other important journal entry to understand is shown in Table 3-3.

Uncollectible Accounts

50      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Journal Entry 3 records an estimate of the uncollectible portion of accounts receiv-
able. (Businesses that don’t want to keep accrual-based accounting statements 
may not need to worry about Journal Entry 3.) Unfortunately, some of the money 
you bill customers may be uncollectible. Yet Journal Entry 1 records every dollar 
that you bill your customers as revenue. Therefore, you need a way to offset, or 
reduce, some of the sales revenue by the amount that ultimately turns out to be 
uncollectible.
Journal Entry 3 shows a common way of doing this. This entry debits bad-debt 
expense — which is an expense account that you may use to record uncollectible 
customer receivables. Journal Entry 3 also credits another account shown as allow-
ance for uncollectible A/R. This allowance account is called a contra-asset account, 
which means that it basically reduces the balance reported on the balance sheet of 
an asset account. In the case of the allowance for uncollectible A/R accounts, for 
example, this $100 credit reduces the accounts receivable balance shown in the 
balance sheet by $100.
Where the bad-debt expense shown in Journal Entry 3 appears varies from busi-
ness to business. Some businesses report the bad-debt expense with the other 
sales revenue, thereby allowing the income statement to show net sales reve-
nue; other businesses report it with the other operating expenses. You should 
report bad-debt expense wherever it makes most sense in terms of managing 
your business.
QuickBooks doesn’t automatically record the transaction in Journal Entry 3. You 
record estimates of bad-debt expense yourself by using the QuickBooks Make 
Journal Entries command. You can find out more about these types of entries in 
Book 4, Chapter 1.
Removing uncollectible  
accounts receivable
If you do set up an allowance for uncollectible accounts, you also need to peri-
odically remove the uncollectible accounts from both the accounts receivable 
balance and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. You don’t want to do this 
while any chance to collect on the accounts exists. But at some point, obvi-
ously, you may as well clean out the bad receivables from your records. It makes 
no sense, for example, to have uncollectible receivables from 17 years ago still 
appearing in your balance sheet. Table  3-4 illustrates how to clean out bad 
receivables.

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      51
This journal entry debits the allowance from the uncollectible A/R account for $100. 
The journal entry also credits the accounts receivable account for $100. In combi-
nation, these two entries zero out the allowance for the uncollectible A/R account 
and remove the uncollectible amount from the accounts receivable account.
Writing off an actual, specific uncollectible receivable for invoice should be done 
on a case-by-case basis. This is what Journal Entry 4 shows.
None of these entries is particularly tricky as long as you understand the logic — 
something that I hope I’ve illuminated for you in this discussion. If you do have 
trouble with these journal entries or with recording the economic events that they 
attempt to summarize, you may want to consult your CPA. Most likely, you would 
record these same transactions (with different customers and amounts, of course) 
many, many times over the year. If you can get a bit of help or a template that 
shows you how to record these transactions, you should be able to record them 
yourself without any outside help.
To write off an uncollectible account receivable, you record a credit memo and 
then apply the credit memo to the uncollectible account. The item shown in your 
credit memo should cause the allowance for uncollectible accounts to be debited.
Recording Accounts Payable  
Transactions
Within QuickBooks, you have the option of working with or without an accounts 
payable account. If you want to, you can record expenses when you write checks. 
This means that to have a complete list of all your expenses, you must have 
recorded checks that pay all your expenses. This approach works fine — and, in 
fact, is the approach that I’ve always used in my businesses.
QuickBooks also supports a more precise approach of recording expenses. By 
answering a few questions during the QuickBooks setup process, you can set up 
an accounts payable account, which is just an account that tracks the amounts 
that you owe your vendors and other suppliers.

Recording a bill
When you use an accounts payable account, you enter the bills that you get from 
vendors when you receive them.
Table 3-5 shows the way this transaction is recorded. Journal Entry 5 automati-
cally debits office-supplies expense for $1,000 and credits accounts payable for 
$1,000. This journal entry would be recorded by QuickBooks if you purchased 
$1,000 of office supplies and then entered that bill into the QuickBooks system.
Paying a bill
When you later pay that bill, QuickBooks records Journal Entry 6, shown in 
Table 3-6. In Journal Entry 6, QuickBooks debits accounts payable for $1,000 and 
credits cash for $1,000. The net effect on accounts payable combining both the 
purchase and the payment is zero. That makes sense, right? The approach shown 
in Journal Entries 5 and 6 counts the amount that you owe some vendor or sup-
plier as a liability — accounts payable — only while you owe the money.
When you record Journal Entry 6 in QuickBooks, you must supply the name of the 
account that gets debited. QuickBooks obviously knows which account to credit: 
the accounts payable account. But QuickBooks also has to know the expense or 
asset account to debit.
QuickBooks does need to know which cash account to credit when you pay an 
accounts payable amount. You identify this when you write the check to pay 
the bill.

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      53
Taking some other accounts  
payable pointers
Let me make a couple of additional points about Journal Entries 5 and 6:
»
» The accounts payable method is more accurate. The accounts payable 
method, which is what Journal Entries 5 and 6 show, is the best way to record 
your bills. The accounts payable method means that you record expenses 
when the expenses actually occur. As you may have already figured out, the 
accounts payable method is the mirror image of the accounts receivable 
approach described in the early paragraphs of this chapter. The accounts 
payable method, as you may intuit, delivers two big benefits: It keeps track of 
the amounts that you owe vendors and suppliers, and it recognizes expenses 
as they occur rather than when you pay them (which may be some time later).
»
» Not every debit is for an expense. Journal Entry 5 shows the debit going to 
an office-supplies expense account. Many of the accounts payable that you 
record are amounts owed for expenses. Not every accounts payable transac-
tion stems from incurring some expense, however. You may also need to 
record the purchase of an asset, such as a piece of equipment. In this case, 
the debit goes not to an expense account but to an asset account. Except for 
this minor change, however, the transaction works in the same way. I describe 
how fixed asset accounting works later in this chapter, in the “Accounting for 
Fixed Assets” section.
Can you guess how an expense or fixed asset purchase gets recorded if you don’t 
use an accounts payable account? In the case in which you paid $1,000 for office 
supplies, QuickBooks debits office-supplies expense for $1,000 and credits cash 
for $1,000 when you write a $1,000 check. As part of writing the check, you iden-
tify which expense account to debit.
If you’re purchasing a $1,000 piece of equipment, the journal entry looks and 
works roughly the same way. When you record the purchase, QuickBooks debits 
the asset account for $1,000 and credits cash for $1,000. Again, this transaction 
gets recorded when you write the check to pay for the asset.
Inventory Accounting
Fortunately, most of the inventory accounting that goes on in a business gets 
handled automatically by QuickBooks. When you purchase an inventory item by 
writing a check or recording an accounts payable bill, for example, QuickBooks 
automatically adjusts your inventory accounts for both the dollar value of the 

54      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
inventory and the quantity of the items. When you sell an inventory item to a cus-
tomer, QuickBooks again automatically adjusts the dollar value of your inventory 
and adjusts the quantity counts of the items you sell.
Basically, all this means is that QuickBooks maintains a perpetual inventory 
­system  — an inventory system that lets you know at any time what quantity 
of items you have in inventory and what value your inventory amounts to. (In 
the past, smaller firms often used a periodic inventory system, which meant that 
­business owners never really knew with any precision the dollar value of their 
inventory or the quantity counts for the inventory items that they held.)
Although everything in the preceding paragraph represents good news, several 
inventory-related headaches do require a bit of accounting magic. Specifically, if 
your firm carries inventory, you need to know how to deal with obsolete inven-
tory, disposal of obsolete inventory, and inventory shrinkage. I discuss all three 
accounting gambits in the following sections.
Dealing with obsolete inventory
Obsolete inventory refers to items that you’ve purchased for sale but turn out not to 
be saleable. Perhaps customers no longer want it. Perhaps you have too much of 
the inventory item and will never be able to sell everything that you hold.
In either case, you record the fact that your inventory value is actually less than 
what you purchased it for. And you want to record the fact that, really, the money 
you spent on the obsolete item is an expense. Suppose that you purchased some 
$100 item that you now realize is obsolete. How do you record this obsolescence? 
Table 3-7 shows the conventional approach.
As Journal Entry 7 shows, to record the obsolescence of a $100 inventory item, you 
first debit an expense account called something like “Inventory obsolescence” for 
$100. Then you credit a contra-asset account named something like “Allowance 
for obsolete inventory” for $100. As I mention in the discussion of accounts 
receivable, a contra-asset account gets reported on the balance sheet immediately

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      55
below the asset account to which it relates. The contra-asset account, with its 
negative credit balance, reduces the net reported value of the asset account. If 
the inventory account balance is $3,100, and you have an allowance for an obso-
lete inventory contra-asset account of $100, the net inventory balance shows as 
$3,000. In other words, the contra-asset account gets subtracted from the related 
asset account.
QuickBooks requires you to record Journal Entry 7 yourself, using the Make ­Journal 
Entries command.
Disposing of obsolete inventory
When you ultimately do dispose of obsolete inventory, you record a journal entry 
like the one shown in Table 3-8. This journal entry debits the contra-asset account 
for $100 and credits inventory for $100. In other words, this journal entry removes 
the value of the obsolete inventory from both the allowance for obsolete inventory 
account and the inventory account itself. You record this journal entry when you 
actually, physically dispose of the inventory — when you pay the junk man to haul 
away the inventory, for example, or when you toss the inventory into the large 
Dumpster behind your office or factory.
In general, one of the things you should do every year for tax accounting reasons 
is deal with your obsolete inventory. The tax rules generally state that you can’t 
write off obsolete inventory unless you actually dispose of it for income purposes. 
Typically, however, you can write down inventory to its liquidation value. Such a 
write-down works the same way as a write-down for obsolete inventory. A write-
down can be a little tricky if you’ve never done it before, however, so you may 
want to confer with your tax adviser.
One more really important point about recording disposal of obsolete inven-
tory: Within QuickBooks, you record inventory disposal by adjusting the physical 
item count of the inventory items. I describe how adjusting the physical inven-
tory accounts works in Book 3, Chapter 3. So even though I won’t go down that 
path here, you should know that you don’t actually enter a journal entry like the 
one shown in Journal Entry 8. You adjust the inventory accounts for the obsolete 
TABLE 3-8

56      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
inventory. This adjustment would automatically reduce the inventory account 
balance. When QuickBooks asks you which account to debit, you specify the allow-
ance for obsolete inventory account.
Dealing with inventory shrinkage
The other chronic inventory headache that many business owners and business 
managers have to deal with is inventory shrinkage. It’s very likely, sometimes 
for the most innocent reasons, that your inventory records overstate the quantity 
counts of items. When this happens, you must adjust your records. Essentially, 
you want to reduce both the dollar value of your inventory and the quantity counts 
of your inventory items.
WHY NOT JUST CREDIT THE ASSET 
ACCOUNT?
If you’re really getting into this double-entry bookkeeping, you may wonder why you 
don’t just credit the inventory account in the case of something like obsolete inventory. 
Wouldn’t that save you time and trouble? Well, yes and no.
Simply crediting the inventory account does make sense. Such an approach saves you 
the task of having to set up a goofy contra-asset account. Accountants, however, have 
concluded over the centuries that it makes sense to keep a record of your obsolete 
inventory as long as you own it. There are a bunch of reasons for this, but one reason is 
that you want to know what inventory you need to get rid of or dispose of.
It’s not necessary to set up some sort of separate system for keeping track of obsolete 
inventory. By using the contra-asset account, you can continue to store information 
about your inventory in the accounting system without making the balance sheet infor-
mation and income statement information incorrect.
This logic applies to other contra-asset accounts, too. Earlier in this chapter, I describe 
how to set up a contra-asset account for uncollectible accounts receivable. The business 
about wanting to have some record of your uncollectible accounts receivable — ­perhaps 
so you know you don’t want to deal with those customers again — means that you may 
as well keep this information in the accounting system. A contra-asset account allows 
you to do so and at the same time not have uncollectible receivables present to over-
state your accounts receivable balance.

Special Accounting 
Problems
CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      57
Table 3-9 shows the journal entry that QuickBooks makes for you to record this 
event. This journal entry debits an appropriate expense account  — in Journal 
Entry 9, I call the expense account “Shrinkage expense” — for $100. A journal 
entry also needs to credit the inventory account for $100.
Within QuickBooks, as I’ve mentioned, you don’t actually record a formal journal 
entry like the one shown here. You use something called a physical count worksheet 
to adjust the quantities of your inventory item counts to whatever they actually 
are. When you make this adjustment, QuickBooks automatically credits the inven-
tory account balance and adjusts the quantity counts. QuickBooks also requires 
you to supply the expense account that it should debit for the shrinkage.
In the old days (by the old days, I mean a few decades ago), businesses compared 
their accounting records with the physical counts of inventory items only once a 
year. In fact, the annual inventory physical count was a painful ritual that many 
distributors and retailers went through. These days, I think, most businesses have 
found that it works much better to stage physical inventory counts throughout the 
year. This approach, called cycle counting, means that you’re probably comparing 
your accounting records with physical counts for your most valuable items sev-
eral times a year. For your moderately valuable items, you’re probably compar-
ing your inventory accounting records with physical counts once or twice a year. 
With your least valuable inventory items, you probably compare inventory records 
with physical counts only irregularly, and you may accept a degree of imprecision. 
Rather than count screws in some bin, for example, you may weigh the bin and 
then make an estimate of the screw count. In any case, you want some system that 
allows you to compare your accounting records with your physical counts. Inven-
tory shrinkage and inventory obsolescence represent real costs of doing business 
that won’t get recorded in your accounting records in any other way.
Accounting for Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are those items that you can’t immediately count as expenses when 
purchased. Fixed assets include such things as vehicles, furniture, equipment, and 
so forth. Fixed assets are tricky for two reasons: Typically, you must depreciate 
TABLE 3-9 
Journal Entry 9: Recording Inventory Shrinkage
Account
Debit
Credit

Inventory
$100

58      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
fixed assets (more on that in a bit), and you need to record the disposal of the fixed 
asset at some point in the future for either a gain or a loss.
Purchasing a fixed asset
Accounting for the purchase of a fixed asset is pretty straightforward. Table 3-10 
shows how a fixed-asset purchase typically looks.
If you purchase a $12,000 delivery truck with cash, for example, the journal entry 
that you use to record this purchase debits delivery truck for $12,000 and credits 
cash for $12,000.
Within QuickBooks, this journal entry actually gets made when you write the 
check to pay for the purchase. The one thing that you absolutely must do is set 
up a fixed-asset account for the specific asset. In other words, you don’t want to 
debit a general catch-all fixed-asset account. If you buy a delivery truck, you set 
up a fixed-asset account for that specific delivery truck. If you buy a computer 
system, you set up a fixed-asset account for that particular computer system. In 
fact, the general rule is that any fixed asset that you buy individually or dispose 
of later individually needs its own asset account. The reason is that if you don’t 
have individual fixed-asset accounts, the job of calculating gains and losses on the 
disposal of the fixed asset turns into a Herculean task later.
Dealing with depreciation
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick to recognize the expense of using a fixed 
asset over a period of time. Although you may not be all that familiar with the 
mechanics of depreciation, you probably do understand the logic. For the sake of 
illustration, suppose that you bought a $12,000 delivery truck. Also suppose that 
because you know how to do your own repair work and take excellent care of your 
vehicles, you’ll be able to use this truck for ten years. Further suppose that at the end 
of the ten years, the truck will have a $2,000 salvage value (your best guess). Depre-
ciation says that if you buy something for $12,000 and later sell it for $2,000, that 
decrease in value can be apportioned to expense. In this case, the $10,000 decrease 
in value is counted as expense over ten years. That expense is called depreciation.

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      59
Accountants and tax accounting laws use a variety of methods to apportion the 
cost of using an asset over the years in which it’s used. A common method is 
called straight-line depreciation. Straight-line depreciation divides the decrease in 
value by the number of years that an asset is used. An asset that decreases $10,000 
over ten years, for example, produces $1,000 a year of depreciation expense.
To record depreciation, you use a journal entry like the one shown in Table 3-11.

CHOOSING A DEPRECIATION METHOD
Straight-line depreciation, which I illustrate here, makes for a good example in a book. 
It’s easy to understand and to illustrate. Most accountants and business owners use 
more complicated depreciation methods, however, for a variety of reasons. One of the 
most important reasons is that tax accounting laws generally allow for depreciation 
methods that accelerate tax deductions.
You can figure out the annual depreciation according to one of these tax-based depre-
ciation methods with your tax adviser’s help. Different rules apply to different types 
of assets. The rules that you use for a particular asset depend on when you originally 
purchased the asset. I recommend that you use the same asset depreciation method in 
QuickBooks that you use for your tax accounting. Depreciation is complicated enough 
as it is. You don’t want to be using one method of depreciation within QuickBooks for 
your own internal financial management and another method for your tax returns.
While I’m on the subject of depreciation, I should also mention that many small firms 
have the option of using something called a Section 179 election. (Section 179 is a chunk 
of law in the Internal Revenue Code.) A Section 179 election allows many businesses to 
immediately depreciate 100 percent of the cost of many of their fixed assets at the time 
of purchase. Despite the fact that a Section 179 election means that you can immedi-
ately write off the purchase of, for example, a $24,000 vehicle at the time of purchase, 
you still want to treat fixed assets expensed via a Section 179 election the way I describe 
here. The difference is that you’ll immediately show the asset as fully depreciated — 
which means depreciated down to its salvage value or down to zero.

60      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Journal Entry 11 debits an expense account called “Depreciation expense” for 
$1,000. Journal Entry 11 also credits a contra-asset account called “Acc. dep. — 
delivery truck” for $1,000. (By convention, because the phrase accumulated depre-
ciation is so long, accountants and bookkeepers usually abbreviate it as acc. dep.) 
Note also that you need specific individual accumulated depreciation contra-asset 
accounts for each specific individual fixed asset account. You don’t want to lump 
all your accumulated depreciation together into a single catch-all account. That 
way lie madness and ruin.
Disposing of a fixed asset
The final wrinkle of fixed asset accounting concerns disposal of a fixed asset for a 
gain or for a loss. When you ultimately sell a fixed asset or trade it in or discard it 
because it’s now junk, you record any gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. You 
also remove the fixed asset from your accounting records.
To show you how this works, consider again the example of the $12,000 delivery 
truck. Suppose that you’ve owned and operated this truck for two years. Over that 
time, you’ve depreciated $2,000 of the truck’s original purchase price. Further 
suppose that you’re going to sell the truck for $11,000 in cash. Table 3-12 shows 
the journal entry that you would make to record this disposal.
The first component of Journal Entry 12 shows the $12,000 credit of the delivery 
truck asset. This makes sense, right? You remove the delivery truck from your 
fixed-asset amounts by crediting the account for the same amount that you origi-
nally debited the account when you purchased the asset.
The next component of the journal entry shows the $11,000 debit to cash. This 
component, again, is pretty straightforward. It shows the cash that you receive by 
selling the asset.

Problems
CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      61
The third component of the journal entry backs out the accumulated deprecia-
tion. If you depreciated the truck $1,000 a year for two years, the accumulated 
depreciation contra-asset account for the truck should equal $2,000. To remove 
this accumulated depreciation from your balance sheet, you debit the accumulated 
depreciation account for $2,000.
The final piece of the disposal journal entry is a plug — a calculated amount. You 
know the amount and whether that amount is a debit or credit by looking at the 
other accounts affected. In the case of Journal Entry 12, you know that a $1,000 
credit is necessary to balance the journal entry. Debits must equal credits.
A credit is a gain. A credit is essentially revenue, as you may remember from the 
discussion of double-entry bookkeeping in Book 1, Chapter 2.
If the plug was a debit amount, the disposal produces a loss. This makes sense; a 
loss is like an expense, and expenses are debits.
If you’re confused about the gain component of Journal Entry 12, let me make 
this observation. Over the two years of use, the business depreciated the truck 
by $2,000. In other words, the business, through the depreciation expense, said 
that the truck lost $2,000 of value. If, however, the $12,000 delivery truck is sold 
two years later for $11,000, the loss in value doesn’t equal $2,000. The loss in 
value equals $1,000. The $1,000 gain essentially recaptures the unnecessary extra 
depreciation that was incorrectly charged.
You can enter Journal Entries 11 and 12 as journal entries within QuickBooks by 
using the Make Journal Entries command.
Recognizing Liabilities
Liabilities are amounts that a business owes to other parties. If a business owes a 
bank money because of a loan, that’s a liability. If a business owes an employee 
wages or benefits, that’s a liability. If a business owes the federal, state, or local 
government taxes, those are liabilities.
Borrowing money
Liabilities, fortunately, aren’t that tricky to record after you’ve seen how the jour-
nal entries look. Table 3-13, for example, shows how you record money borrowed 
on a loan. In the case of a $10,000 loan, you would debit cash for $10,000 and 
credit a loan payable liability account for $10,000.

62      BOOK 1  An Accounting Primer
Sometimes, you may purchase an asset with a loan. Suppose that you purchased 
$10,000 of furniture by using a note payable or a loan. Even though there’s no 
immediate cash effect, you still record the transaction. Table 3-14 shows how you 
record this transaction. A furniture account gets debited for $10,000, and a loan 
payable account gets credited for $10,000.
You can record Journal Entry 13 directly in your checkbook when you record the 
$10,000 cash deposit. You can also record Journal Entry 13, as well as Journal 
Entry 14, by using the Make Journal Entries command that QuickBooks provides. 
By the way, you can record Journal Entry 14 only by using the Make Journal Entries 
command.
Making a loan payment
To record the payment on a loan, you or QuickBooks makes a journal entry like 
the one shown in Table 3-15. Suppose that in connection with the loan shown in 
Journal Entry 13, you need to pay $2,200. Further suppose that this amount is for 
$1,200 of loan interest and $1,000 of principal. In this case, you debit loan pay-
able for $1,000, debit loan interest expense for $1,200, and credit cash for $2,200.

Special Accounting 
Problems
CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      63
Sometimes, the tricky thing about loan payments is breaking the payment amount 
into its principal and interest components. Ideally, the lender will provide you 
an amortization schedule that breaks down payments into principal and interest.
If a lender doesn’t provide such an amortization schedule, you can calculate the 
interest expense yourself by using either a spreadsheet or a calculator. (I also have 
some free amortization schedules available at my website: www.stephenlnelson.
com.) Then, after you’ve calculated the interest expense, you can deduce the prin-
cipal component by subtracting the interest from the payment amount.
Accruing liabilities
I want to show you one other liability-related journal entry. Very commonly, a 
business owes money for some goods or services or taxes that must be recorded 
in the accounting system. If, at the end of an accounting period — say, at the end 
of the year — you owe $1,200 of interest on some loan, you really need to record 
that interest expense in your accounting system. You want to record the fact that 
although the loan balance may show as $10,000 in your accounting records, you 
probably really owe $11,200 because you owe both the $10,000 of principal and 
$1,200 of accrued interest.
To accrue a liability, you use a journal entry like the one shown in Table 3-16. This 
journal entry shows the accrual of $1,200 of interest expense on a loan payable.
The journal entry shows a $1,200 debit to loan interest expense and a $1,200 credit 
to loan interest payable. This journal entry records amounts that you owe as of the 
end of the accounting period that don’t get recorded in some other way.
You need to be careful about using journal entries like the one shown in Journal 
Entry 16. Typically, you want to use such journal entries when it’s very important 
to count all your expenses and to accurately measure all your liabilities.
One common situation when you want to be especially careful about making such 
accruals occurs if you sell your firm. Any prospective purchaser wants to have not 
only a very good estimate of your true expenses for the accounting period, but also 
a very accurate estimate of liabilities at the time the business is being evaluated.

the accountant or bookkeeper, however. To return to the example of the accrued 
interest shown in Journal Entry 16, suppose that at a later time, the business 
makes a $3,000 payment, which includes the interest accrued in Journal Entry 16. 
When the accountant or bookkeeper later records this loan payment, he or she 
must remember or recognize the earlier journal entry. You don’t want the accoun-
tant or bookkeeper to double-count interest expense by again recording the same 
interest. This makes sense, right?
Because accountants and bookkeepers can’t reliably remember these sorts of 
accrual entries — they may need to recall them months later — they typically 
back out the effect of the accrual from the first day of the new accounting period.
If Journal Entry 16 were recorded at the end of year 1 to accurately estimate inter-
est expense and liability balances, an accountant or bookkeeper could, on the first 
day of year 2, enter a reversing journal entry. This reversing journal entry would 
credit loan interest expense for $1,200 and debit loan interest payable for $1,200. 
In other words, this reversing journal entry reverses the earlier accrual. Because 
the accrual entry is still in year 1, however, year 1’s estimates of interest expense 
and liability account balances are still correct.
Table 3-17 shows how a reversing entry looks. Again, notice that it’s simply the 
mirror image of Journal Entry 16. The debits and credits are flip-flopped.
When the actual loan interest payment is made, the journal entry appears as 
though no accrual or reversal ever existed. Table 3-18 shows this. Suppose that 
at some time in year 2, the business pays $1,800 of interest by making a cash 
­payment. Journal Entry 18 shows how this transaction gets recorded.

Special Accounting

CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      65
Let me just quickly summarize what happens with Journal Entries 16, 17, and 18:
»
» Journal Entry 16 enables you to show that at the end of year 1, the business 
owes $1,200 of interest on a loan — even though that interest hasn’t yet been 
paid. Journal Entry 16 also shows that even though the money wasn’t paid, 
loan interest expense of $1,200 was incurred.
»
» Journal Entries 17 and 18 need to be combined to be understood. Journal 
Entry 17, for example, reduces the loan interest payable to zero. Remember 
that the loan interest payable would be a balance sheet liability account. 
The combination of the $1,200 debit and credit zero this account out. The 
$1,200 credit to loan interest expense in Journal Entry 17 must be combined 
with the $1,800 debit to loan interest expense in Journal Entry 18. This seems 
funny, because after all, aren’t you really paying $1,800 of interest? That’s 
true. But looking back at Journal Entry 16, you can see that you’ve already 
recorded $1,200 of loan interest expense. That interest expense has been 
recorded for year 1 in this example. If you have $1,800 of loan interest in 
total, what’s left over for year 2 is the remaining $600. The combination of the 
$1,200 credit to loan interest expense and the $1,800 debit to loan interest 
expense produces this $600 of loan interest expense. The only other compo-
nent of these two journal entries is the $1,800 credit to cash. This credit to 
cash represents just the actual cash payment that’s made to pay the loan 
interest amount.
You need to be careful when working with accrual entries, reversing entries, and 
then the real entries that follow and correct everything in the end. These tools can 
be enormously helpful when it’s important to accurately measure expenses and 
liabilities. You must remember to complete the entire sequence of transactions, 
however; you can’t stop halfway.
One last important point: In Journal Entries 16, 17, and 18, I talk about how to 
accrue loan interest expense. You can use this accrual technique to recognize any 
liability — a fact that I want to emphasize. You can use the technique demon-
strated in these journal entries to deal with liabilities for things such as wages 
owed to employees, taxes owed to the government, and so forth.
Some firms, particularly those with sophisticated accounting systems, can even 
use this technique to record hard-to-quantify liabilities, such as warranty lia-
bilities. (A warranty is a promise that you make to a customer; for example, you 
promise that your product won’t break.) These promises create liabilities and 
expenses. An accurate accounting system requires that you record these expenses 
as they occur and recognize these liabilities as they come into existence.

Closing Out Revenue and 
Expense Accounts
You’re about to enter the twilight zone of accounting. In this section, I talk about 
what happens to revenue and expense accounts at the end of the year in tradi-
tional manual accounting systems. Then I explain why QuickBooks doesn’t quite 
work that way and what you need to do about it.
If you want to skip anything in this chapter, this section is probably the material. On 
the other hand, if you (like me) have a compulsive personality and deem it essential to 
read everything in this chapter (even stuff that’s not particularly exciting), read on.
Book 1, Chapter 1 and Book 1, Chapter 2 describe an imaginary hot-dog-stand busi-
ness. This is a one-day business that (in my imagination) you operate. (If you’ve 
been reading through this chapter and have no questions, you don’t even need to 
worry about the two preceding chapters.) Table 3-19 shows the trial balance for 
this business at the end of the day of operation.
The traditional close
As I hope you already know, revenue and expense accounts count revenue and 
expenses for a particular period of time. Revenue and expense accounts may count 
for the month, the quarter, or the year, for example.

Special Accounting 
Problems
CHAPTER 3  Special Accounting Problems      67
One thing that accounting systems traditionally do is zero out the revenue and 
expense accounts at the end of the year. This makes sense if you think about it 
a bit. You want your counters reset at the beginning of the year so that counting 
the new year’s revenue and the new year’s expenses is easy. In the case of a trial 
balance like the one shown in Table 3-19, for example, you’d typically make the 
journal entry shown in Table 3-20.
If you look at Journal Entry 19 (Table 3-20), for example, you see that the first 
line in the journal entry is a $13,000 debit for sales revenue. If you look back at 
the trial balance shown in Table 3-19, you see that sales revenue has a $13,000 
credit balance. The combination of the account balance shown in Table 3-19 and 
the closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19 (Table 3-20) effectively zeros out the 
sales revenue account.
The same sort of accounting magic occurs for each of the other expense accounts 
shown in the trial balance. The cost-of-goods-sold balance is equal to a $3,000 
debit in Table 3-19 and is zeroed out in Journal Entry 19 with a $3,000 credit. And 
so it goes.
The QuickBooks close
The sort of accounting taught at local community colleges makes just the sort of 
closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19, but you actually don’t need or even want 
to make such a closing entry within QuickBooks.
The closing entry shown in Journal Entry 19 gets made in a manual system so 
that the revenue and expense accounts can be reset to zero. By comparison, 
QuickBooks, relying on the power of the computer, doesn’t need to have these 
accounts reset to zero in order to correctly calculate the revenue and expense for 
the new accounting period. QuickBooks, as you discover throughout this book, can

calculate revenue or sales for any period and for any interval of time by using its 
report generation tool to summarize the revenue and expenses that occur within 
a particular time interval.
This seemingly missed step doesn’t cause any idiosyncratic behavior on the part of 
QuickBooks. QuickBooks lumps the revenue and expenses from all the previous years 
into a retained earnings amount reported on the balance sheet. Net income for the 
current year is also reported in the equity portion of the balance sheet. In addition, 
if you have a corporation, QuickBooks typically includes a dividends paid account in 
the equity portion of the balance sheet. I’m getting ahead of myself, however.
The main thing that I want you to know is that this seemingly critical textbook 
journal entry for closing out revenue and expense accounts isn’t made within 
QuickBooks. This is okay, because QuickBooks doesn’t need to make the tradi-
tional closing entry.
You may want to ask your accountant about this entry. Typically, however, any 
dividends paid by a corporation are zeroed out or combined with retained earn-
ings at the end of the year. If you want to combine dividends paid for the current 
year with accumulative retained earnings, you do this with a journal entry. The 
journal entry credits the dividends paid account and debits retained earnings for 
the amount of dividends paid for the year. I hesitate to encourage you to make this 
journal entry willy-nilly, however. I think it’s okay to skip making the entry. And 
before you make it, consult your tax adviser.
One More Thing . . .
In this chapter, I try to address some of the common, complicated Journal Entries 
and accounting transactions that business owners encounter. I know that I can’t 
answer every question here, but I do want to provide as thorough a set of instruc-
tions as possible. All of this is leading up to a special request: If you’ve read this 
chapter and didn’t find a discussion of the sort of journal entry or accounting 
transaction that you need to record, send me an email or write me a letter that 
tells me what help you hoped to find here . . . but didn’t. (You can get contact 
information at www.stephenlnelson.com.)
I can’t promise you that I’ll be able to supply an answer. But if you describe a 
journal entry that I should have included, I’ll try to respond to your email with 
instructions on how to make the journal entry. I’ll also include a description of the 
journal entry in the next edition of this book.

CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      71
Setting Up QuickBooks
T
o use QuickBooks, you need to do two things: Install the QuickBooks soft-
ware and run either the Express Start or Advanced Setup version of the 
QuickBooks Setup process. This chapter gives you a bird’s-eye view of both 
of these tasks. I also want to spend just a few paragraphs talking about some of 
the planning that you should do before you set up QuickBooks and some of the 
missing setup steps in the QuickBooks Setup process — things it should do but 
doesn’t. (Don’t worry: I tell you how to complete the missing steps, partly at the 
end of this chapter and also in the next chapter.)
Planning Your New QuickBooks System
I start with a couple of big-picture discussions: what accounting does and what 
accounting systems do. If you understand this big-picture stuff from the very 
start, you’ll find that the QuickBooks Setup process makes a whole lot more sense.
What accounting does
Think about what accounting does. People may argue about the little details, but 
most would agree that accounting does the following four important things:
»
» Measures profits and losses
»
» Reports on the financial condition of a firm (its assets, liabilities, and net worth)

»
» Provides detailed records of the assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity accounts
»
» Supplies financial information to stakeholders, especially to management
What accounting systems do
Now take a brief look at what accounting systems, or at least at what small-
business accounting systems typically do:
»
» Produce financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, 
and other accounting reports.
»
» Generate business forms, including checks, paychecks, invoices, customer 
statements, and so forth.
»
» Keep detailed records of key accounts, including cash, accounts receivable 
(amounts that customers owe a firm), accounts payable (amounts that a firm 
owes its vendors), inventory items, fixed assets, and so on.
»
» Perform specialized information management functions. In the publishing 
industry, for example, book publishers often pay authors royalties. So royalty 
accounting is a task that book publishers’ accounting systems typically must do.
What QuickBooks does
Okay, after you understand what accounting does and what accounting systems 
typically do, you can see with some perspective what QuickBooks does:
»
» Produces financial statements
»
» Generates many common business forms, including checks, paychecks, 
customer invoices, customer statements, credit memos, and purchase orders
»
» Keeps detailed records of a handful of key accounts: cash, accounts receiv-
able, accounts payable, and inventory in simple settings
Allow me to make an important observation here: QuickBooks does three of the 
four things that you would expect an accounting system to do. Compare the list 
that I just provided with the preceding list (“What accounting systems do”). I’ll 
save you the time of finding the fourth thing: QuickBooks doesn’t supply the spe-
cialized accounting stuff. It doesn’t do royalty accounting, for example, as dis-
cussed in the earlier example.

Setting Up QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      73
And now for the bad news
So QuickBooks does three of the four things that accounting systems do, but it 
doesn’t do everything. QuickBooks is often an incomplete accounting solution. 
Be careful, therefore, about setting your expectations. Typically, you also need to 
figure out work-arounds for some of your special accounting requirements.
QuickBooks gives users and businesses a lot of flexibility. To return to the pre-
vious example, a book publisher can do much of what it needs to do for royalty 
accounting in QuickBooks. This royalty accounting work simply requires a certain 
amount of fiddling as the business is setting up QuickBooks.
But QuickBooks (or at least the most popular versions) does suffer a couple of 
significant weaknesses:
»
» QuickBooks Pro doesn’t supply a good way to handle the manufacturing 
of inventory. QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 
do support simple manufacturing accounting, however, and QuickBooks 
Enterprise Solutions provides some additional inventory management 
capability (multiple inventory sites, lot and serial number tracking, and 
FIFO costing) as part of its Advance Inventory feature. These versions of 
QuickBooks help you account for the process of turning raw materials into 
finished goods and also deal with some real-life inventory complexities.
»
» Only QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions handles the situation of storing 
inventory in multiple locations. In other words, QuickBooks Pro and 
QuickBooks Premier simply show, for example, that you have 3,000 widgets. 
It doesn’t let you keep track of the fact that you have 1,000 widgets at the 
warehouse, 500 widgets at store A, and 1,500 widgets at store B.
In spite of the fact that QuickBooks may be an incomplete solution and may not 
handle inventory the way you want or need, QuickBooks is still a very good solution. 
No, wait — that’s not really strong enough. What QuickBooks does, it does very well.
Like a lot of things in life, finding the right accounting solution is all about balance. 
Some of the factors that you may consider when choosing your accounting soft-
ware would be ease of use, portability, price, data security, customer service, and 
the way it integrates with other business tools. The desktop version of QuickBooks 
has been a good balance of the things I need, which is why I use it for my business.
The desktop version of QuickBooks provides considerably more horsepower than 
the online version of QuickBooks (or other cloud-based systems). That said, the 
online version makes it far easier to work with an outside accountant or book-
keeper. Accordingly, for those clients who really need outside professional help 
but who don’t need advanced desktop features (like job costing), the online ver-
sion of QuickBooks is a very reasonable choice, too.

Installing QuickBooks
You install QuickBooks the same way that you install most applications or 
programs — either by download or via a disc containing the software. I’d begin 
at https://quickbooks.intuit.com, where you can compare some of product 
options, chat with a sales agent, or, if you are ready, purchase the version of your 
choosing. After purchase, you should be able to download the product (definitely 
reach out to Intuit if you can’t). If you purchase a copy of QuickBooks from a 
brick-and-mortar store, you just need to insert the disc into the proper drive.
After downloading the program (or inserting the disc containing the software), 
you don’t need to do anything special to install QuickBooks. Simply follow the 
onscreen instructions. Typically, you’re prompted to enter the installation key 
or installation code. This code and key are available within the QuickBooks 
packaging — usually, on the back of the envelope that the disc comes in — if you 
purchase the software in a local store. Otherwise, Intuit provides these items to 
you during the online purchase.
The QuickBooks installation process may ask you to answer questions about how 
you want QuickBooks to be installed. Almost always, you want to accept the default 
suggestions. In other words, QuickBooks may ask you whether it can create a new 
folder in which to install the QuickBooks program files. In this case, choose yes.
If your version of Microsoft Windows doesn’t recognize that you’ve stuffed the 
QuickBooks CD into the machine’s CD or DVD drive, you have a couple of choices:
»
» You can wait. If you wait, Windows probably will recognize that you’ve placed 
the QuickBooks CD in the CD or DVD drive, and after a short wait (even 
though it may seem like an eternity), Windows starts the process of installing 
the QuickBooks program.
»
» You can manually force the installation of the QuickBooks program. Windows 
includes a tool that you can use to add or remove new programs (unsurprisingly 
named the Add/Remove Programs tool). I don’t describe how this Control Panel tool 
works here, but you can refer to a book such as Windows 10 For Dummies, by Andy 
Rathbone (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), or Windows online Help to get this information. 
In a nutshell, you simply open the Control Panel window, click the Add/Remove 
Programs tool, and follow the onscreen instructions for telling Windows to install a 
program stored on the CD or DVD in the computer’s CD or DVD drive.
QuickBooks can work as a multiuser accounting system. This means that sev-
eral people can use QuickBooks. The QuickBooks data file — the repository of all 
the QuickBooks information — typically resides on a centrally available computer 
or server. People who want to work with the QuickBooks data file simply install 
the QuickBooks program on their computers and then use the program to access 

Setting Up QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      75
centrally located QuickBooks data files. This multiuser system isn’t complicated 
to run; in fact, I talk about it quite a bit in Book 7, Chapter 1.
You need to own a separate copy of QuickBooks for each computer on which you 
install QuickBooks. You can also buy multiuser copies of QuickBooks that let you 
install the QuickBooks program on up to 5 computers (or on up to 30 computers 
if you’re running QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions). I mention this because you 
don’t want to get involved in software piracy — which is a felony — as part of 
inadvertently setting up QuickBooks in the wrong way. The bottom line: You need 
a legal copy of QuickBooks for every machine on which you install QuickBooks.
Dealing with the Presetup Jitters
After you install QuickBooks, you run an onscreen wizard to set up QuickBooks for 
your firm’s accounting. Cleverly, this onscreen wizard is called QuickBooks Setup. 
In the next sections, I explain what you need to do before you use the QuickBooks 
Setup so that you work in an efficient manner. I also give you an overview of what 
you’ll do as you go through the QuickBooks Setup.
Preparing for setup
In running QuickBooks Setup, you provide quite a bit of information to QuickBooks. 
As a practical matter, setup and postsetup cleanup (which I describe in this chapter 
and the next one) require that you have the following:
»
» Accurate financial statements as of the conversion-to-QuickBooks date
»
» Detailed records of your accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, 
and fixed assets
»
» A complete or nearly complete list of employees, customers, vendors, and 
inventory items (if you buy and sell inventory)
You want to get all this stuff together before you start QuickBooks Setup because 
(depending on how you go about setting up QuickBooks) you may be asked about 
this stuff as part of the setup process. Don’t try to scurry around looking for a 
particular piece of data while you’re running the setup wizard; collect this data up 
front. Then stack all the necessary paperwork on your desk next to your computer.
Let me also note that you’re going to make several accounting decisions as you go 
through QuickBooks Setup. You may be asked to decide whether you want to use 
an accounts payable system, for example. You may choose to use the setup wiz-
ard to tell QuickBooks whether you want to send customers monthly statements. 

76      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
You may also be asked whether you want to prepare estimates for customers or 
whether you want to use classes to further track your income and spending.
In general, when you’re asked any of the accounting questions, you can simply accept 
the default answer. You’re required by law to be consistent in your accounting for 
tax purposes, however. If you want to change your accounting — technically called 
a change of accounting method by the Internal Revenue Service — you must request 
permission from the IRS to make that change. How to do this and the ramifications 
of doing it are beyond the scope of this book, but be forewarned: The IRS insists 
that you be consistent in your accounting. If you’ve been treating particular items 
of income or expense in a certain way, the IRS says, “Hey, dude, you must continue 
to treat them that way unless you get permission from us to change.”
I should make a clarification: You can use one accounting method for your tax return 
and then, within QuickBooks, use a different accounting method. You may be locked 
into using accrual-basis accounting on your tax return, for example. But that doesn’t 
mean you can’t use cash-basis accounting within QuickBooks and in managing your 
business. Accordingly, what I say in the preceding paragraphs is a little bit inaccu-
rate. Technically. But you probably don’t want to use one accounting approach on 
your tax return and a different approach in QuickBooks. Too complicated.
One final note: You should have your tax return from last year handy because it 
supplies information that you need for running QuickBooks Setup. Last year’s tax 
return, for example, supplies your taxpayer ID number, your legal business name, 
and your method of accounting.
Seeing what happens during setup
As you walk through the setup process, you work with QuickBooks to set Quick-
Books preferences (which determine how QuickBooks works and which features 
are initially available) and to set up a chart of accounts and your bank accounts.
The chart of accounts, just so you know, identifies those income, expense, asset, 
liability, and owner’s equity accounts that appear in your financial statements.
After you complete QuickBooks Setup, you’re almost ready to begin using QuickBooks. 
In fact, in a pinch, you could (after QuickBooks Setup) limp along with QuickBooks.
An important point of clarification: You may think that you should be ready to 
rock and roll after installing QuickBooks and running through the setup. But you 
have two other tasks to complete: identifying your starting trial balance (which 
I describe at the end of this chapter) and loading your key master files (which 
I mostly describe in the next chapter). The trial balance identifies your year-to- 
date income and expense numbers, and your asset, liability, and owner’s equity 

Setting Up QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      77
numbers as of the conversion date. The master files store information about cus-
tomers, vendors, employees, and inventory items that you repeatedly use. The 
customer master file, for example, stores a customer’s name and address, phone 
number, and the contact person’s name (if different).
Running the QuickBooks Setup Wizard
After you install the QuickBooks program, the installation program may start 
QuickBooks automatically and then start QuickBooks Setup. You can also start the 
QuickBooks Setup by starting the QuickBooks program the same way you start 
any program and by then choosing the File ➪   New Company command to start 
QuickBooks Setup.
Getting the big welcome
The Let’s Get Your Business Set Up Quickly screen of QuickBooks Setup (see 
Figure 1-1) appears when you choose File ➪   New Company. The screen provides 
some general information about setting up a new company within QuickBooks. 
You probably want to read this screen’s information. When you’re ready to begin, 
click either the Express Start button or the Detailed Start button.
FIGURE 1-1:  
The QuickBooks 
Setup window, 
showing the wel-
come message.

78      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The Express Start method
QuickBooks provides an accelerated version of the QuickBooks setup process, 
which you can use when you don’t want to customize setup. If you click the 
Express Start button, QuickBooks collects a bit of information about your com-
pany and, based on that information, sets up a company file that should work for 
a business like yours.
After you click Express Start to create the company file, QuickBooks prompts 
you to describe the people (customers, vendors, and employees) you do business 
with, the items you sell, and your bank account. You provide these descriptions by 
stepping through a series of screens and filling in onscreen boxes and worksheets. 
I describe how this process works later in the chapter, in the section “Adding your 
information to the company file.”
The Detailed Start method
The Detailed Start button, if clicked, starts the EasyStep Interview, which walks 
you through a bunch of screens full of information that let you rather tightly 
specify how the company file that QuickBooks sets up should look.
To move to the next screen in the EasyStep Interview, you click the Next but-
ton. To move to the previous screen, you click the Back button. If you get dis-
couraged and want to give up, you can click the Leave button. But try not to get 
discouraged.
Supplying company information
The first few screens of the EasyStep Interview collect several important pieces of 
general information about your business, including your company name and the 
firm’s legal name, your company address, the industry in which you operate, your 
federal tax ID number, the first month of the fiscal year (typically, January), the 
type of income tax form that your firm uses to report to the IRS, and the industry 
or type of company that you are operating (retail, service, and so forth). The first 
screen of the EasyStep Interview is shown in Figure 1-2.
QuickBooks isn’t very smart about the tax accounting rules for limited liability 
companies (LLCs). An LLC can be treated as a sole proprietorship if it has one 
owner and as a partnership if it has more than one owner. But LLCs may also 
elect to be treated as S corporations or C corporations. If you’ve made such an 
election for your LLC, be sure to indicate that the LLC is an S corporation or 
C corporation.

Setting Up QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      79
After collecting this general company information, QuickBooks creates the 
company data file that stores your firm’s financial information. QuickBooks 
suggests a default name or a QuickBooks data file based on the company name 
(see Figure 1-3). All you need to do is accept the suggested name and the suggested 
folder location (unless you want to save the data file in the Documents folder, 
which isn’t a bad idea).

Customizing QuickBooks
After QuickBooks collects the general company information mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraphs, the EasyStep Interview asks you some very specific questions 
about how you run your business so it can set the QuickBooks preferences. Pref-
erences in effect turn on or off various accounting features within QuickBooks, 
thereby controlling how QuickBooks works and looks. Here are the sorts of ques-
tions that the EasyStep Interview asks to set the QuickBooks preferences:
»
» Does your firm maintain inventory?
»
» Do you want to track the inventory that you buy and sell?
»
» Do you collect sales tax from your customers?
»
» Do you want to use sales orders to track customer orders and back orders?
»
» Do you want to use QuickBooks to help with your employee payroll?
»
» Do you need to track multiple currencies within QuickBooks because you deal 
with customers and vendors in other countries, and these people regularly 
have the audacity to pay or invoice you in a currency different from the one 
your country uses?
»
» Would you like to track the time that you or your employees spend on jobs or 
projects for customers?
»
» How do you want to handle bills and payments (enter the checks directly, or 
enter the bills first and the payments later)?
Setting your start date
Perhaps the key decision that you make in setting up any accounting system is the 
day on which you begin using your new system. This day is called the conversion 
date. Typically, you want to begin using an accounting system on either the first 
day of the year or the first day of a new month. Accordingly, one other big ques-
tion you’re asked is about the conversion date. You’re prompted to identify the 
start date by using the dialog box shown in Figure 1-4.
The easiest time to start using a new accounting system is the beginning of the 
year. The reason? You get to enter a simpler trial balance. At the start of the year, 
for example, you enter only asset, liability, and owner’s equity account balances.
At any other time, you also enter year-to-date income and year-to-date expense 
account balances. Typically, you have this year-to-date income and expense 
information available only at the start of the month. For this reason, the only 
other feasible start date that you can pick is the start of a month.

Setting Up QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      81
In this case, you get year-to-date income amounts through the end of the 
previous month from your previous accounting system. If you’ve been using 
Sage 50 Accounting, for example, get year-to-date income and expense amounts 
from Sage.
After you’ve provided the start date, supplied the basic company information, 
identified most of your accounting preferences, and identified the date on which 
you want to start using QuickBooks, you’re almost done.
If you click the Leave button, QuickBooks leaves you in the QuickBooks program, 
ready to get to work. The EasyStep Interview process isn’t lost forever, however. 
To get back into the interview, just open the file you were in the process of setting 
up. When you do, the EasyStep Interview restarts.
Reviewing the suggested chart  
of accounts
At the very end of the EasyStep Interview, based on the information that you sup-
ply about your type of industry and the tax return form that you file with the IRS, 
QuickBooks suggests a starting set of accounts, which accountants call a chart 
of accounts. These accounts are the categories that you use to track your income, 
expenses, assets, liabilities and owner’s equity. Figure 1-5 shows the screen that 
the EasyStep Interview displays for showing you these accounts.
FIGURE 1-4:  
The EasyStep 
Interview dialog 
box that lets 
you select the 
start date.

82      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The accounts that QuickBooks marks with a check, as the screen explains, are the 
recommended accounts. If you don’t do anything else, these checked accounts are 
the ones you’ll use (at least to start) within QuickBooks. You can remove a sug-
gested account by clicking the check mark. QuickBooks removes the check mark, 
which means that the account won’t be part of the final chart of accounts. You can 
also click an account to add a check mark and have the account included in the 
starting chart of accounts.
You can click the Restore Recommendations button at the bottom of the list to 
return to the initial recommended chart of accounts (if you made changes that you 
later decide you don’t want).
When the suggested chart of accounts looks okay to you, click Next. It’s fine to just 
accept what QuickBooks suggests because you can change the chart of accounts 
later.
Adding your information to  
the company file
No matter whether you use the Express Start method of creating a company file 
or the Detailed Start/EasyStep Interview method, after you and QuickBooks set up 
the company file, QuickBooks prompts you to enter your own information in the 
company file (see Figure 1-6).

accounts.

CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      83
Customers, vendors, and employees
To describe customers, vendors, and employees, click the first Add button. 
­QuickBooks asks whether it’s possible to get this data from someplace else, such 
as an email program or email service (Outlook, Gmail, and so forth), or if you just 
want to enter the information into a worksheet manually. You’re probably going 
to enter the information manually, so click the appropriate button and then click 
Continue. When QuickBooks displays a worksheet window (see Figure 1-7), enter 
each customer, vendor, or employee in its own row, and be sure to include both 
the name and address information. Click Continue when you finish. QuickBooks 
then asks (using a screen I don’t show here) whether you want to enter opening 
balances (amounts you owe or are owed) for customers and vendors. Indicate that 
you do by clicking the Enter Opening Balances link and then enter the opening 
balances in the screen that QuickBooks provides.
Services and inventory items you sell
To describe the stuff you sell, click the second Add button (refer to Figure 1-6). 
QuickBooks asks about the stuff you sell — whether you sell services, whether 
you sell inventory items, and whether you want to track any such inventory items 
you sell, for example. Answer these questions by clicking the option button that 
conforms to your situation and then click Continue. When QuickBooks displays 
a worksheet window (not shown), describe each item you sell on a separate

worksheet row. Also be sure to describe any inventory items you’re holding at the 
time you convert to QuickBooks. Click Continue when you finish. If you sell more 
than one type of item, you need to repeat this process for each type of item.
Business bank accounts
To describe your business bank account (or bank accounts), click the third Add 
button (refer to Figure  1-6). When QuickBooks displays the Add Your Bank 
Accounts worksheet window (not shown), provide each bank account’s name, 
account number, and balance on the conversion date. When you finish entering 
this information, click Continue.
Identifying the Starting Trial Balance
Regardless of whether you use the Express Start version or the Detailed Start/
EasyStep Interview version of the QuickBooks Setup process, you don’t actually 
get a complete trial balance in the QuickBooks company file simply by setting 
up. Assuming that you follow the instructions and tips provided in the preceding 
paragraphs, you get only your bank account, accounts receivable, inventory, and 
FIGURE 1-7:  
The QuickBooks 
Setup screen that 
collects informa-
tion about the 
people you do 
business with.

CHAPTER 1  Setting Up QuickBooks      85
accounts payable balances in QuickBooks. Yet you need to enter all the missing 
trial balance information in QuickBooks, too, to begin getting good reports out 
of QuickBooks and to use the software for supplying financial data to your tax 
returns. I end this chapter by talking about how you get the rest of the trial bal-
ance data into the QuickBooks company file.
A simple example to start
To record the rest of your starting trial balance, you record a journal entry. The 
journal entry records the remaining trial balance amounts for all your other 
accounts at the conversion or start date: accounts other than your bank accounts, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.
As a simple example to show you how this works, suppose that you have the trial 
balance shown in Table 1-1. Note that these trial balances are used in the discussion 
in Book 1, Chapter 2 and shown in that chapter’s Table 2-19. Please notice that 
no balance is recorded for a bank account, no balance is recorded for accounts 
receivable (because this account doesn’t even show up in the trial balance), and no 
balances are recorded for inventory or accounts payable (because these accounts 
have zero balances at the conversion date). For purposes of this example (but not 
the next example), the cash balance isn’t a bank account but is actually cash: a desk 
drawer full of low-denomination, used bills with nonsequential serial numbers.

Figure 1-8 shows how the Make General Journal Entries window looks when it 
records the missing trial balance information from Table 1-1. After this journal 
entry is recorded, the trial balance is correct as of the start date.
For more information about how to record a journal entry by using the Make Gen-
eral Journal Entries window, see Book 4, Chapter 1. If you want to try this on your 
own with no further instruction from me, choose the Company ➪   Make General 
Journal Entries command. When QuickBooks displays the Make General Journal 
Entries window, as shown in Figure 1-8, use the Account, Debit, and Credit col-
umns to record your journal entry.
If the idea of making a journal entry terrifies the heck out of you, you may find 
yourself in a bit of a pickle. You need to become comfortable working with double-
entry bookkeeping to set up QuickBooks at a time other than at the beginning of the 
year. This means, unfortunately, that if you’re setting up QuickBooks sometime 
during the middle of the year, you must enter a general journal entry to fix the 
weirdness that the QuickBooks Setup creates. If you don’t know how double-entry 
bookkeeping works — if debits and credits aren’t your friends — you probably 
need to get somebody’s help. I suggest that you call your CPA or some other friend 
who truly understands accounting. Get him or her to come over and enter the last 
part of the trial balance for you by using the Make General Journal Entry window.
FIGURE 1-8:

Note: This shouldn’t be a big project if you decide to call your CPA. If she comes 
over to your office, and if you have the trial balance ready for her, it should take 
her only a few minutes to enter the necessary general journal entry. Perhaps you 
can buy her a nice lunch, and that will settle the score.
A real-life example to finish
Okay, true confessions. The example I give in the preceding section? You prob-
ably won’t be lucky enough to have your starting trial balance journal entry be so 
simple. You probably will have to deal with a bank account and with account bal-
ances in your accounts receivable, accounts payable, or inventory accounts. Now 
I show you how this works.
Suppose that you have the trial balances shown in Table 1-2. Note that in this 
example (unlike the preceding example), the first account shown — the one with 
$5,000 — is a bank account.
Here’s the tricky part of recording this trial balance. You don’t need — I repeat, 
don’t need — to record all this trial balance information through a journal entry. 
Because the bank account, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory

portions have already been recorded if you added customer, vendor, item, and 
bank account information during the QuickBooks Setup process, you just need to 
enter the rest of the trial balance.
Because you won’t be recording all the trial balance, however, your journal entry 
not only won’t match your actual trial balance, but also won’t balance. To make 
it balance, therefore, you plug the difference into an account that QuickBooks 
­supplies for just this sort of bookkeeping madness: the Opening Balance Equity 
account. Figure 1-9 shows this journal entry.

hen you set up QuickBooks 2017, as a practical matter, you not only 
create a company file you’ll use to store financial information about 
your business, but also set up master file lists. These master file lists 
store information that you can use and reuse. One of the master file lists describes 
each of your customers; this master file of customer information includes the 
customer’s name and address, contact information, account numbers, and so on.
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of adding information to each of 
the master files — or lists, as QuickBooks calls them — that you need to fill (or 
mostly fill) before you begin using QuickBooks on a day-to-day basis.
One important note: You don’t need to completely fill your master files before you 
start doing anything. If you enter your active customers into the customer master 
file, your active vendors into the vendor master file, and so forth, that amount of 
information may be all you need to get started. With the information you entered 
through the QuickBooks Setup process (as described in Book 2, Chapter 1) and 
the addition of a few more entries in key master files, you may be able to add 
everything else on the fly. QuickBooks enables you to add entries to the various 
master files as you work with windows and dialog boxes that reference master file 
information.

Setting Up the Chart of Accounts List
The Chart of Accounts list is a list of accounts that you use to categorize your 
income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity amounts. If you want to 
see a particular line item of financial data on a report, you need an account for 
that line item. If you want to budget by a particular line item, you need an account 
for that budget amount. If you want to report some bit of financial information on 
your tax returns, you need an account to collect that specific data.
Fortunately, the steps for creating new accounts are quite straightforward. To set 
up a new account within your Chart of Accounts list, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Lists ➪   Chart of Accounts command.
QuickBooks displays the Chart of Accounts window, shown in Figure 2-1.
2.	 Click the Account button at the bottom of the window.
QuickBooks displays the Account menu. One of the Account menu options is 
New, which is the command that you use to add a new account.
FIGURE 2-1:

Accounts window.

3.	 Add a new account by choosing Account ➪   New.
QuickBooks displays the first Add New Account window, as shown in Figure 2-2.
4.	 Use the account-type buttons to identify the type of account that you’re 
adding.
QuickBooks supplies the following account types: Income, Expense, Fixed 
Asset, Bank, Loan, Credit Card, and Equity, as well as (if you select Other 
Account Types and open the Other Accounts Types drop-down list) Accounts 
Receivable, Other Current Asset, Other Asset, Accounts Payable, Other Current 
Liability, Long Term Liability, Cost of Goods Sold, Other Income, and Other 
Expense. If you have a question about which account type your new account 
fits into, you should review Book 1, Chapter 1, which describes how financial 
statements work. These account groups essentially tell QuickBooks in which 
area of a financial statement account data gets reported. Note, too, that the 
first Add New Account window shows examples of the selected account type in 
the box above the Continue and Cancel command buttons.
5.	 Click Continue.
QuickBooks displays the second Add New Account window, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
FIGURE 2-2:

Account window.

6.	 Use the Account Name box to give your new account a unique name.
The name that you give the account will appear on your financial statements.
7.	 If the account you’re adding is a subaccount of a parent account, identify 
the parent account by selecting the Subaccount Of check box.
After you select the Subaccount Of check box, name the parent account by 
using the Subaccount Of drop-down list.
8.	 (Optional) If you’re setting a bank account that uses a currency other 
than your home-country currency, choose the bank account currency 
from the Currency drop-down list.
In Book 2, Chapter 3, I talk a bit more about working with multiple currencies. 
But let me say this here: If you told QuickBooks that you work in multiple 
currencies (you would have done this during the QuickBooks EasyStep 
Interview setup process, discussed in Book 2, Chapter 1), QuickBooks wants 
you to identify those bank accounts, customers, and vendors that use a 
currency different from your home currency.
Note: The Currency drop-down list doesn’t appear in Figure 2-3 because within 
the example QuickBooks file I used for this book, the multiple-currency 
tracking feature isn’t turned on. To turn on the multiple-currency feature, 
choose the Edit ➪   Preferences command, select the Multiple Currencies 
FIGURE 2-3:

preferences settings, click the Company Preferences tab, and then select the 
Yes I Use More Than One Currency radio button.
9.	(Optional) Provide a description for the new account.
You don’t need to provide a description. Without a description, QuickBooks 
can still use the account name in financial statements. If you want a more-
descriptive label placed in accounting reports, however, use the Description 
box for this purpose.
10.	Provide other account information.
The Add New Account window shown in Figure 2-3 includes a Bank Acct. No. 
box that lets you record the bank account number for a particular bank 
account. Other account types may have similar boxes for storing related 
account information. The credit card account type version of the Add New 
Account window lets you store the card number, for example. If you do have 
another box or two in which to store account information, go ahead and use 
that space, if necessary, to collect the bits and pieces of data that you want 
to save.
11.	Identify the tax line on which the account information is to be reported 
by choosing a tax form and tax line from the Tax-Line Mapping drop-
down list.
You may not need to assign a particular account to a tax line if that account 
data isn’t reported on the business’s tax return. Cash account balances aren’t 
reported on a sole proprietor’s tax return, for example, so a bank account for a 
sole proprietor doesn’t have any required tax line data. Cash account balances 
are recorded on a corporation’s tax return, however. So if you’re adding a bank 
account for a corporation, you use the Tax-Line Mapping drop-down list to 
identify the tax line on which the bank account information gets reported.
12.	(Optional but dangerous) Consider recording an opening balance for the 
account.
Typically, you shouldn’t supply an opening account balance for an account, but 
the second Add New Account window does let you do so. In the window shown 
in Figure 2-3, you can click the Enter Opening Balance command button. When 
you click this button, QuickBooks displays a dialog box that you can use to set a 
starting account balance. All this sounds rather innocuous, but seriously, this is 
something you rarely do. (You should set starting balances for accounts by 
using a journal entry, as discussed at the end of Book 2, Chapter 1.) If you know 
something I don’t, though, you can use this capability to set the starting 
balance for the account as of some date. One last caution, however. My 

94      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
accounting professors taught me two things that suggest that this approach to 
setting account balances is crazy:
•	 Debits are supposed to equal credits. If you’re setting the opening balance for 
an account as part of setting up the new account, you’re recording only 
half of the accounting transaction.
•	 Entering the opening balance as part of setting up a new account means that 
no audit trail exists for the transaction. Rather than having an invoice 
associated with a transaction or a check, or even a general journal entry, 
you’re just setting balances on the fly. But hey, maybe you do know 
something I don’t.
13.	After you describe the new account that you want to set up, click either 
Save & Close or Save & New to save the new account to the Chart of 
Accounts list.
14.	(Optional) Click the Next button to save the account information and 
then redisplay the Add New Account window so that you can add 
another account.
If you look closely at Figure  2-3, you’ll note some boxes, buttons, and even a 
hyperlink that I haven’t talked about. QuickBooks does supply other fields for col-
lecting account information. And occasionally, QuickBooks also provides clickable 
hyperlinks and buttons that you can use to perform special tasks associated with 
the particular type of account. In the case of a bank account, for example, Quick-
Books supplies an Order Checks hyperlink that you can click to start the process of 
ordering check forms for the new account.
And that’s almost everything you need to know about adding accounts. The one 
other thing I should mention is the fact that the Account menu — the menu of 
commands that QuickBooks displays when you click the Account button in the 
Chart of Accounts window (refer to Figure 2-1) — provides several other useful 
commands for working with accounts. These commands include Delete, which 
you use to delete the selected account (as long as you haven’t already used the 
account). The menu also provides an Edit button that you can use to make any 
changes in the selected account information (by using a window that looks very 
much like the New Account window shown in Figure 2-3). The Account menu also 
provides other commands that you can use to work with the Chart of Accounts 
list. Fortunately, most commands have self-descriptive names: Print List, Make 
Inactive, and so on.
The Activities button, which appears at the bottom of the Chart of Accounts win-
dow (refer to Figure 2-1), displays a menu of commands that you can use to write 
checks, make deposits, enter credit card charges, transfer funds, make journal 
entries, reconcile a bank account, use a register, and produce a working trial bal-
ance report. The Reports button displays a menu of commands that you can use to 
print reports containing account information.

Setting Up the Item List
If you choose the Lists ➪   Item List command, QuickBooks displays the Item List 
window, as shown in Figure 2-4. The Item List window lists all the items that 
you’ve set up as part of running QuickBooks Setup and items that you’ve added 
manually since running the setup wizard.
I don’t talk about how you add items to the Item List window here, because Book 3, 
Chapter 3 details that process.
Note, however, that the Item list is very important! It lets you keep track of what 
you buy, hold, and sell to your customers.
Working with the Price Level List
The Price Level list lets you create price adjustments that you can use on the fly as 
you invoice customers, issue credit memos, and so forth. Because the Price Level 
list relates directly to how you work with and bill for inventory items, I describe 
FIGURE 2-4:  
The Item List 
window.

96      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
how you work with that list in Book 3, Chapter 3. Rather than repeat information 
that is of interest to only a few people and isn’t essential for getting started with 
QuickBooks, I refer you instead to Book 3, Chapter 3.
Using Sales Tax Codes
The Sales Tax Code list keeps a list of codes, or abbreviations, that you can use to 
describe items as taxable or nontaxable. If you choose this command, QuickBooks 
displays a window listing the existing sales tax codes. (Usually, you see two exist-
ing codes: Tax and Non.)
The Sales Tax Code list doesn’t appear unless you tell QuickBooks to track sales 
tax during setup or afterward. To add sales tax codes, take the following steps:
1.	 Choose Edit ➪   Preferences.
2.	 Click the Sales Tax item in the preferences list.
3.	 Click the Company Preferences tab.
4.	 Answer the Do You Charge Sales Tax question by clicking the Yes box.
To add a new sales tax code, click the Add Sales Tax Item, and describe the new 
sales tax when QuickBooks displays the New Item dialog box (not shown) by nam-
ing the sales tax item, describing it briefly, and then providing the sales tax rate 
and tax agency.
Setting Up a Payroll Item List
The Payroll Item list identifies items that appear on employee payroll check stubs. 
If you’re using an outside payroll service bureau to handle your payroll — and 
this isn’t a bad idea — you don’t even need to worry about the Payroll Item list. 
If you’re using the QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll Service, again, don’t worry 
about the Payroll Item list. (In either case, the QuickBooks folks set up the payroll 
items that you use for recording payroll.) And in the case of Intuit’s full-blown 
“we-do-everything” Payroll Service, you don’t even need to track payroll inside 
QuickBooks, because the QuickBooks people do it at their office location on their 
computers.

Loading the Master 
File Lists
CHAPTER 2  Loading the Master File Lists      97
If you do need to add payroll items, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Lists ➪   Payroll Item List command.
QuickBooks displays the Payroll Item list window.
2.	 To add a new Payroll Item, click the Payroll Item button and then choose 
Payroll Item ➪   New.
QuickBooks displays the Add New Payroll Item dialog box (not shown). You can 
choose to set up a new payroll item by using either the EZ Set Up method or 
the Custom Set Up method:
•	 EZ Set Up: If you want QuickBooks to help you, and you’re setting up a 
common payroll item, click the EZ Set Up button, click Next, and then 
simply follow the onscreen instructions.
•	 Custom Set Up: If you want to perform a custom setup of a payroll item, 
click the Custom Set Up button and then click Next. QuickBooks walks 
you through a multiple-screen interview — like the EasyStep Interview 
discussed in Book 2, Chapter 1 — that asks you about the payroll item to 
set up. The first dialog box that QuickBooks displays, for example, asks you 
to identify the type of payroll item that you want to create. You answer this 
question by selecting one of the radio buttons and then clicking Next.
3.	 Name the payroll item.
After you identify the type of payroll item, you name it. QuickBooks provides 
another version of the Add New Payroll Item dialog box that includes a field 
you fill in to give the new item a name.
4.	 To finish the payroll item setup, click the Next button to move through 
the remaining payroll item setup questions.
You identify the name of the government agency to which the liability is paid, 
the taxpayer identification number that uniquely identifies you to the taxing 
agency, the liability account that you use to track the items, the tax-form line 
that you use to report the item, the rules that QuickBooks should use for 
calculating the item (such as whether the item is subject to taxes), and a couple 
of other miscellaneous pieces of data. After you supply all this information and 
click the Finish button (which appears in the last Add New Payroll Item 
window), QuickBooks adds the new payroll item to the Payroll Item list.
The Payroll Item menu supplies commands that are useful for working with the 
Payroll Item list. In addition to the commands that you use to add an item to 
the list, the menu supplies commands for deleting payroll items, renaming 
payroll items, making payroll items active, and printing the list of payroll items.

98      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Setting Up Classes
QuickBooks lets you use classes to segregate or track financial data in ways that 
aren’t possible when you use other bits of accounting information, such as the 
account number, the customer, the sales rep, the item, and so forth. A firm can 
use classes, for example, to segregate financial information by stores, business 
units, or geographical territories.
To set up classes, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Lists ➪   Class List command.
QuickBooks displays the Class List window, as shown in Figure 2-5.
If you don’t see the Class List command, choose Edit ➪   Preferences, click the 
Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and select the Use Class 
Tracking check box.
2.	 To create a new class, click the Class button at the bottom of the window, 
and choose Class ➪   New.
QuickBooks displays the New Class dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-6.
FIGURE 2-5:  
The Class List 
window.
FIGURE 2-6:  
The New Class 
dialog box.

Loading the Master 
File Lists
CHAPTER 2  Loading the Master File Lists      99
3.	 To name the new class, enter a name or abbreviation in the Class 
Name box.
Note that you enter the class name whenever you record a transaction that 
falls into the class. For this reason, you don’t want to create lengthy or easy-to- 
mistype class names. Keep things short, simple, and easy.
4.	 If the class that you’re setting up is actually a subclass of a parent class, 
select the Subclass Of check box and then choose the parent class from 
the Subclass Of drop-down list.
5.	 Click OK to save the class.
Alternatively, click Cancel to not save the class or click the Next button to save 
the class and redisplay the New Class dialog box.
If you don’t want the class to be used anymore, you can select the Class Is 
Inactive check box.
The Class menu, which appears when you click the Class button, also supplies 
commands for editing the information of the selected class, for deleting the 
selected class, for making the selected class inactive, and for printing a list of 
classes, as well as several other useful commands. All these commands are 
pretty straightforward to use. Go ahead and experiment with them to find out 
how they work.
Setting Up a Customer List
A Customer list keeps track of all your customers and customer information, such 
as billing and shipping addresses.
Follow these steps to add a customer to the Customer list:
1.	 Choose the Customers  ➪   Customer Center command.
QuickBooks displays the Customer Information window, as shown in Figure 2-7.
2.	 To add a new customer, click the New Customer & Job drop-down list and 
then choose the New Customer command.
QuickBooks displays the New Customer window, as shown in Figure 2-8.
3.	 Use the Customer Name box to give the customer a short name.
You don’t need to enter the customer’s full name in the Customer Name box. 
That information can go in the Company Name box, shown on the Address Info 
tab. You just want some abbreviated version of the customer name that you 
can use to refer to the customer within the QuickBooks accounting system.

100      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
4.	 (Optional) If you bill your customer in a currency different from your 
usual home currency, choose that currency from the Currency drop-
down list.
If you told QuickBooks that you work in multiple currencies — you would have 
done this during the EasyStep Interview setup process — QuickBooks wants 
FIGURE 2-7:

Information

FIGURE 2-8:

­Customer 
window.

you to identify when you invoice a customer and collect payments from a 
customer in a currency different from your home currency. (Note: The 
Currency drop-down list doesn’t appear in Figure 2-8 because the multiple-
currency tracking feature isn’t turned on. If you want more information, see 
Book 2, Chapter 3.)
5.	 (Usual rule) Ignore the Opening Balance and As Of boxes.
You typically don’t want to set the customer’s opening balance by using the 
Opening Balance and As Of boxes. That’s not the right way to set your new 
customer accounts receivable balance. If you do this, you’re essentially setting up 
the debit part of an entry without the corresponding credit part. Later, you’ll have 
to go in and enter crazy, wacky journal entries to fix your incomplete bookkeep-
ing. But an exception to the usual rule exists, as discussed in the tip that follows.
Although the usual rule is that you don’t want to set an opening balance for a 
customer, this rule has an important exception. As discussed at the very end of 
Book 2, Chapter 1, you record your accounts receivable balance on the 
conversion date by setting an opening balance for each customer as of the 
conversion date. The sum of these opening balances is what QuickBooks uses 
to determine your total accounts receivable on the conversion date.
6.	 Use the boxes of the Address Info tab to supply the company name and 
contact information, including contact name, phone numbers, fax 
numbers, email addresses, billing and shipping addresses, and so on.
I’m not going to tell you that you should enter somebody’s first and last name 
in the Full Name boxes or that the phone numbers of your customer go in the 
boxes labeled Main Phone and Work Phone. I figure you don’t need that kind 
of help.
7.	 Click the Payment Settings tab to display the set of boxes shown in 
Figure 2-9.
You can record the customer’s account number, his or her credit limit, 
payment terms, preferred payment and delivery methods, and even credit 
card information. Note that the Online Payments check boxes let you indicate 
a customer can pay you using a credit card or bank transfer — but you need to 
have set up these services already. If you haven’t set up the services, 
QuickBooks prompts you to set them up when you check one of these boxes.
I discuss the Price Level list and how it works in Book 3, Chapter 3.
8.	 (Optional) If you’re tracking sales taxes, click the Sales Tax Settings tab to 
display the boxes you’ll use to identify this customer’s sales tax rate.
The Sales Tax Settings tab, for example, includes a Tax Code drop-down list 
that you use to indicate which sales tax code applies to this particular cus-
tomer. You can also identify the actual sales tax item and, if relevant, the resale 
number.

102      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
9.	Supply a bit of additional information about the customer.
If you click the Additional Info tab, shown in Figure 2-10, QuickBooks displays 
several other boxes that you can use to collect and store customer informa-
tion. You can use the Customer Type drop-down list, for example, to categorize 
a customer as fitting into a particular customer type. (I talk about setting up a 
Customer Type list later in this chapter.) And you can use the Rep drop-down 
list to identify the customer’s default sales rep. Finally, you can click the Define 
Fields button to specify additional fields that you want to collect and report for 
the customer.
10.	(Optional) Click the Job Info tab to describe the customer job.
The Job Info tab lets you describe information associated with a particular job 
being performed for a customer. You use the Job Info tab if you not only set up 
a customer, but also set up a job for that customer. See Book 4, Chapter 5 for 
more information on how job costing works.
11.	When you finish describing the customer, click the Save & Close or Save & 
New button to save your description.

Setting Up the Vendor List
Just as you use a Customer list to keep records of all your customers, you use a 
Vendor list to keep records of your vendors. Like a Customer list, a Vendor list 
lets you collect and record information, such as the vendor’s address, the contact 
person, and so on.
To add a vendor to your Vendor list, follow these steps:
1.
Choose the Vendors  ➪   Vendor Center command.
When you do, QuickBooks displays the Vendor Information window, as shown 
in Figure 2-11.
2.
To add a new vendor, click the New Vendor drop-down list and then 
choose New Vendor.
QuickBooks displays the New Vendor window, as shown in Figure 2-12.
3.
Give the vendor a name in the Vendor Name box.
As is the case with the Customer list, you use this name to refer to the vendor 
within QuickBooks. For this reason, an abbreviation is fine. You just want 
something easy to enter and easy to remember.

Info tab.

4.	 (Optional) If you pay your vendor in a currency different from your usual 
home currency, select that currency from the Currency drop-down list.
If you told QuickBooks that you work in multiple currencies — you would have 
done this during the EasyStep Interview setup process — QuickBooks wants 
you to identify when you receive bills from or pay a vendor in a currency 
different from your home currency. (Note: Figure 2-12 doesn’t show the 
Currency drop-down list because the multiple-currency tracking feature isn’t 
turned on.)
5.	 (Usual rule) Ignore the Opening Balance and As Of fields.
Don’t do anything with the Opening Balance and As Of boxes. People who 
don’t know better use those boxes to enter the opening balance owed a 
vendor and the date the amount is owed, but these entries only create 
problems later. At some point in the future, this poor soul’s accountant will 
need to find and correct this error. As when you add new customers, however, 
an exception to the usual rule exists, as discussed in the tip that follows.
Although the usual rule is that you don’t want to set an opening balance for a 
vendor, this rule has an important exception. As discussed at the very end of 
Book 2, Chapter 1, you record your accounts payable balance on the conver-
sion date by setting an opening balance for each vendor as of the conversion 
date. The sum of these opening balances is what QuickBooks uses to deter-
mine your total accounts payable on the conversion date.
6.	 Supply the vendor address information.
The Address Info tab supplies a bunch of easy-to-understand boxes that you 
use to collect vendor name and address information. You enter, predictably, 
the vendor’s full name in the Company Name box.
You can click the Edit buttons on the Address Info tab to display another dialog 
box called the Edit Address Information dialog box, which lets you enter the 
address in typical street address, city, state, and zip-code format. The Edit 
buttons appear to the right of the Billed From and Shipped From address 
blocks.
7.	 Supply any additional information necessary.
The Payment Settings tab (see Figure 2-13) collects the most relevant vendor 
information, including account number, credit limit, and payment terms, but if 
you click the Tax Settings tab, the Account Settings tab, or the Additional Info 
tab, QuickBooks displays a handful of other boxes that you can use to collect 
and store information:
•	 The Tax Settings tab lets you collect the vendor’s tax identification number 
so you can (as sometimes required by federal tax laws) send the vendor a 
Form 1099 at the end of the year.

106      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
•	 The Account Settings tab lets you specify which accounts QuickBooks should 
use to prefill account fields when entering a transaction for the vendor.
•	 The Additional Info tab lets you categorize the vendor according to type and 
also lets you create other custom fields.
If you’re paying a vendor for the first time, a good guideline is to get his tax ID 
number. If somebody won’t give you his tax ID number — thereby making it 
impossible for you to report payments that you make to him — it’s probably a 
sign that something is a bit amiss.
8.	 Click OK.
The New Vendor window closes and you go back to the Vendor Center.
If you click the Account Settings tab (the fourth tab available in the New Vendor 
window), QuickBooks displays boxes you can use to list the accounts that you 
want QuickBooks to automatically fill in for you when you record a check to some 
vendor or when you record a bill from some vendor. If the check to the phone 
company pays telephone expenses, for example, you could tell QuickBooks to pre-
fill that expense category the next time you enter a bill or record a check to pay 
FIGURE 2-13:  
The Payment 
Settings tab.

Loading the Master 
File Lists
CHAPTER 2  Loading the Master File Lists      107
that vendor. It won’t enter an amount as obviously that can change, but you won’t 
have to search through all your accounts to find telephone expense if you utilize 
this option.
Setting Up a Fixed Assets List
If you choose the Lists ➪   Fixed Asset Item List command, QuickBooks displays the 
Fixed Asset Item list window. You can use this window to see a list of the fixed 
assets — furniture, equipment, machinery, vehicles, and so forth — that you’ve 
purchased. That is, you can see this list after you click the Item drop-down list, 
choose New, and fill in the New Item window for each fixed asset. Figure 2-14 
shows the New Item window you use to describe each fixed asset.
Let me make a couple of comments about the QuickBooks Fixed Asset Item list. 
The Fixed Asset Item list doesn’t really integrate with the QuickBooks general 
ledger. You record the purchase or disposal of fixed assets by using regular old 
QuickBooks transactions. You might record the purchase of a particular fixed asset 
simply by entering a check in the usual fashion. And you might record the disposal 
of a fixed asset by entering a general ledger journal entry.
FIGURE 2-14:  
You describe 
each fixed asset 
by using the New 
Item window.

108      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The Fixed Assets Item list, then, just acts as a stand-alone list that lets you track 
the fixed assets you purchased. Because the list is so stand-alone-ish, I’m not 
going to spend much time talking about it in this book. Let me also say that your 
CPA probably — no, surely — maintains a list of your fixed assets because she 
needs that list to correctly include depreciation on your tax return and in your 
financial statements (if you get a CPA to help prepare those). For this reason, 
some people — including me — see the Fixed Asset Item list as being a little bit 
redundant.
Setting Up a Price Level List
A price level changes the sales price up or down when you do things like invoice. 
You might create a price level that amounts to a preferred customer discount on 
specified items. When you create an invoice for those items, rather than use the 
standard price for the item (which appears in the Create Invoice window’s Price 
column), you could select the price level preferred customer discount (in the Price 
column) to use the discounted preferred customer.
To create a price level, choose the Lists ➪   Price Level command. When QuickBooks 
displays the Price Level list window (not shown), click the Price Level drop-down 
list and then choose New. When QuickBooks displays the New Price Level dialog 
box, give the price level a name in the Price Level Name text box, use the Price 
Level Type box and list to specify to which items the price level applies, and then 
use the Adjust Price and Rounding boxes to set the new price level’s prices. When 
you click OK, QuickBooks redisplays the Price Level list window — this time with 
your new price level. You can edit and delete existing price levels by using other 
commands that become available when you click the Price Level button.
Setting Up a Billing Rate Level List
A billing rate sets the amount that you charge for service items. Whereas a law 
firm might sell only hours of legal advice, for example, the item “legal advice” 
would be billed at different rates for different attorneys. An attorney just out of 
law school might have his or her time billed at one rate, while a senior partner in 
the firm might bill at another, probably much higher rate.
To set up a billing rate, you choose the Lists ➪   Billing Rate Levels List command. 
When QuickBooks displays the Billing Rate Level window (not shown), click the 
Billing Rate Level drop-down list and then choose New to display the New Billing 
Rate Level dialog box. You use the New Billing Rate Level dialog box to define a 

Loading the Master 
File Lists
CHAPTER 2  Loading the Master File Lists      109
billing rate, giving the billing rate level a name, and then set a fixed hourly rate for 
the billing-rate level or different hourly rates for different service items.
After you create billing-rate levels with the Billing Rate Levels List command, 
by the way, you need to connect those levels with specific employees so that the 
correct rate gets used when an employee’s time is billed. To do this, display the 
Employee Center window by choosing the Employees ➪   Employee Center com-
mand. Then right-click the employee, choose Edit Employee from the shortcut 
menu, click the Additional Info tab when QuickBooks displays the Edit Employee 
dialog box, and select the appropriate billing rate in the Billing Rate Level list box.
Setting Up Your Employees
If you choose the Employees ➪   Employee Center command, QuickBooks displays 
the Employee Center window (not shown). You can use this window to see a list 
of the employees — active or inactive — whom you’ve identified to QuickBooks. 
You can also use this window’s New Employee button to add employees to the list.
Because I discuss how to add employees to the Employee list in Book 3, Chapter 5, 
I won’t repeat that information here.
Setting Up an Other Names List
If you choose the Lists ➪   Other Names List command, QuickBooks displays the 
Other Names list window (not shown). The Other Names list identifies those busi-
nesses or individuals that you pay but that don’t fall into one of these other stan-
dard categories: customers, vendors, and employees. You might use the Other 
Names list to identify government agencies that you pay, for example.
To add a name to the Other Names list, click the Other Names button, which 
appears at the bottom of the Other Names window. When QuickBooks displays 
the Other Names menu, choose New. The New Name window that QuickBooks 
displays after you choose the New command provides boxes for entering a name, 
identifying the entity, recording an address, and so on. I don’t show this window 
here because it’s just a simplified version of the window that you use to identify 
and describe a customer, vendor, or employee.

110      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Setting Up the Profile Lists
If you choose the Lists ➪   Customer & Vendor Profile List command, QuickBooks 
displays a submenu of commands that you use to create some of the mini lists 
that QuickBooks uses to ease your bookkeeping and accounting. The Profile lists 
include lists of sales reps, customer types, vendor types, job types, payment 
terms, customer messages, payment methods, shipping methods, and vehicles. 
Most of the Profile lists are pretty darn simple to use. If you choose the Sales Rep 
list command, for example, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep list window. Then 
you click the Sales Rep drop-down list and choose New. QuickBooks displays the 
New Sales Rep dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-15. I bet you can figure out how 
to use this dialog box.
In case you’re still experiencing a certain amount of accounting anxiety, let me 
just point out that you enter the name of the sales representative in the Sales Rep 
Name box. Then, throwing caution to the wind, you enter the sales rep’s initials 
in the Sales Rep Initials box. When you click OK, QuickBooks adds the sales rep to 
your Sales Rep list.
The other Profile lists work in the same simple, scaled-down fashion. You choose 
the Profile list from the submenu, click the Profile List button, and choose New. 
When QuickBooks displays a window, you use one or two boxes to describe the 
new Profile list.
Just to prove to you that this process really is as easy as I say, take a look at the 
New Customer Message dialog box (accessible from the Customer Message list), 
shown in Figure 2-16. This dialog box is the one you use to create a new customer 
message for placement at the bottom of customer invoices and credit memos.

Rep dialog box.

If you want to track vehicle mileage within QuickBooks — and note that you usu-
ally must track business vehicle mileage to claim business vehicle expenses as a 
tax deduction — you can maintain a list of business vehicles by using the Vehicle 
list. This list lets you easily track your business vehicles — something you do by 
choosing the Company ➪   Enter Vehicle Mileage command.
QuickBooks may provide access to other lists via the Lists menu. You can access tem-
plates you create for invoicing and other forms by choosing the Lists ➪   ­Templates 
command. (I discuss form templates in Book 3, Chapter 1.) And depending on how 
you’ve installed the software, QuickBooks may add lists I haven’t mentioned here. 
Depending on your installation and the state where you operate, QuickBooks may 
display a list of Workers Compensation items, for example.

CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      113
Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
Y
ou can fine-tune how QuickBooks works for you by setting preferences. 
In fact, just so you know, much of what you do when you run QuickBooks 
Setup via the Detailed State route (also known as the QuickBooks EasyStep 
Interview) is provide information that QuickBooks uses to fine-tune. If you indi-
cate that you charge customers sales tax, for example, the EasyStep Interview 
describes how sales tax should work for your business by using the sales tax 
preferences.
Because these preferences have so much effect on how QuickBooks works and on 
how a particular user works with QuickBooks, I devote this chapter to describing 
how you change the preferences. None of this material is particularly complicated, 
but because QuickBooks provides you a rich set of preferences options, I cover 
quite a bit of material. Don’t worry: You don’t have to read this chapter from 
beginning to end. Simply use it as a reference when you have a question about how 
to change the way QuickBooks works in a particular area.

Accessing the Preferences Settings
You can set preferences within QuickBooks in two ways:
»
» During the Detailed Start/EasyStep Interview: You actually set all the prefer-
ences, or at least all the starting preferences for QuickBooks, when you run the 
EasyStep Interview. Most of the time, the preferences that the Detailed Start/
EasyStep Interview sets are correct. QuickBooks is very smart about the way it 
asks questions and translates your answers into preferences settings. But if your 
business changes, if you make a mistake during the setup interview, or if someone 
in your office ran the Detailed Start/EasyStep Interview for you, you may still need 
to check and fiddle-faddle with these preferences.
»
» By manually changing the preferences: You can manually change the 
preferences by choosing the Edit ➪   Preferences command. QuickBooks displays 
the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-1. QuickBooks groups catego-
ries of preferences. All the accounting preferences, for example, are grouped 
into an accounting preference set, and all the checking account preferences are 
grouped into a checking preference set. If you look closely at Figure 3-1, you see 
that along the left edge of the Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks displays a list 
of icons. The first icon is Accounting. The second icon is Bills. To see the 
preferences within one of these groups, you click that preference’s icon.
One other item to note about the Preferences dialog box is that it supplies, in 
general, two tabs of preferences for each preference set. Preferences that are spe-
cific to an individual user appear on the My Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-1. 
FIGURE 3-1:

ences tab of the

the Accounting 
preferences.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      115
Preferences that are tied to the company data file appear on the Company Prefer-
ences tab, shown in Figure 3-2.
Not every My Preferences tab gives you options for changing the way that Quick-
Books works. Sometimes a particular set of preferences gives personal options; 
sometimes it doesn’t.
The My Preferences tab of the Bills set of preferences, for example, provides no 
personalized options. In other words, you can’t tell QuickBooks that in your firm, 
billing works differently for different users. This makes sense, right? Billing needs 
to work the same way for every user within a firm. With other preferences set-
tings, QuickBooks may allow different options for different users. You see this as I 
discuss the various sets of preferences in the remainder of this chapter.
Now I’m going to walk you through a discussion of each of these preferences sets. 
I talk both about the My Preferences option (if available) and the Company Prefer-
ences option.
Setting the Accounting Preferences
The My Preferences tab of the Accounting Preferences dialog box (refer to 
Figure 3-1) provides a single option: You can tell QuickBooks you want it to autofill 
information when recording a general journal entry.

116      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Don’t get irritated with the lack of personalization, however. This almost total 
lack of individually personalized preferences makes sense, if you think about it. 
Accounting for a business needs to work the same way for Jane as it does for Joe 
and for Susan.
You do have the option to set several company preferences for accounting, how-
ever. Again, this makes sense if you think about it. Different companies run their 
accounting systems in different ways.
Figure  3-3 shows the Company Preferences tab of the Accounting Preferences 
dialog box.
Using account numbers
By default, QuickBooks lets you use names to identify accounts in the Chart of 
Accounts list or in the accounts list. The account that you use to track wages expense 
may be known as “wages,” for example, but you can select the Use Account Num-
bers check box to tell QuickBooks that you want to use account numbers rather than 
account names for identifying accounts. Larger businesses and businesses with 
very lengthy lists of accounts often use account numbers. When you use numbers, 
you can more easily control both the ordering of accounts on a financial statement 
and the insertion of new accounts into the Chart of Accounts list.
The Show Lowest Subaccount Only check box lets you tell QuickBooks that it 
should display the lowest subaccount rather than the higher parent account in 
financial statements. QuickBooks allows you to create subaccounts, which are 
FIGURE 3-3:  
The Company 
Preferences tab 
of the Account-
ing Preferences 
dialog box.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      117
accounts within accounts (discussed further in Book 2, Chapter 2). You can also 
create sub-subaccounts, which are accounts within subaccounts. You use sub-
accounts to more finely track assets, liabilities, equity amounts, revenue, and 
expenses.
Setting general accounting options
The Company Preferences tab (not shown) provides the following five general 
accounting check boxes, as well as date warnings and closing date settings. 
(The check boxes are probably self-explanatory to anybody who has done a bit 
of accounting with QuickBooks, but for new QuickBooks users, I provide a brief 
description of what each one does.)
»
» Use Account Numbers: The Use Account Numbers check box, if selected, 
enables you to enter an account number for a transaction. The associated 
check box, Show Lowest Subaccount Only, tells QuickBooks to display only the 
name and account number of a subaccount (if you’re using one) instead of the 
full heritage of the account. If you use a lot of levels of subaccounts, this 
option can really clean up views, making it easier to tell what account you’re 
looking at.
»
» Require Accounts: The Require Accounts check box, if selected, tells 
QuickBooks that you must specify an account for a transaction. This makes 
sense. If you aren’t using accounts to track the amounts that flow into and out 
of the business, you aren’t really doing accounting. It would never make sense, 
in my humble opinion, to deselect the Require Accounts check box.
»
» Use Class Tracking for Transactions: The Use Class Tracking check box lets 
you tell QuickBooks that you want to use not only accounts to track your 
financial information, but also classes. Classes let you split account level 
information in another way. This sounds complicated, but it’s really quite 
simple. The account list, for example, lets you track revenue and expenses by 
categories of revenue and expense. You may track expenses by using 
categories such as wages, rent, and supplies. Classes, therefore, provide you a 
way to track this information in another dimension. You can split wages 
expense into those wages spent for two different locations of your business, 
for example. A restaurateur with two restaurants may want to do this. Note 
that QuickBooks also provides boxes you can check to indicate that 
QuickBooks should prompt you to assign classes and to assign classes to 
accounts, items, or names.
»
» Automatically Assign General Journal Entry Number: This check box tells 
QuickBooks to assign numbers to the general journal entries that you enter by 
using the Make Journal Entry command. You want to leave this check box 
selected. General journal entries, by the way, are typically entered by your CPA 
or your professional on-staff accountant.

118      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
»
» Warn When Posting a Transaction to Retained Earnings: This check box 
tells QuickBooks to display a warning message whenever you attempt (or 
someone else attempts) to directly debit or credit its retained earnings 
account. (Normally, you don’t want to directly debit or credit the retained 
earnings account, and only skilled accountants would enter transactions 
directly into retained earnings in any case.)
»
» Hide Opening Balance Fields in Names and Items: Check this box to tell 
QuickBooks to hide opening balance information for customers, vendors, 
other names, and for items.
»
» Date Warnings: The Date Warnings boxes tell QuickBooks to warn you when 
you enter (or someone else enters) a transaction with a date too far in the 
past or too far into the future. If you check either of the Date Warnings boxes, 
you also want to specify how many days are too far into the past or too far 
into the future.
»
» Closing Date setting: The Closing Date box lets you identify a date before 
which your QuickBooks data file can’t be changed. In other words, if you set 
the closing date to December 31, 2016, you’re telling QuickBooks that you 
don’t want any changes made to the QuickBooks data file before this date. 
This means that someone can’t modify a transaction that’s dated before your 
closing date without getting a scary warning message. It also means that 
someone can’t enter a transaction by using a date before this closing date. 
You can click the Set Date/Password button to display a dialog box that lets 
you specify a closing date and create the password required when someone 
wants to add an old transaction or modify an old transaction.
Long ago, past versions of QuickBooks also let you turn an audit trail feature on 
and off by using the Company Preferences tab of the Accounting Preferences dia-
log box. All recent versions of QuickBooks provide an always-on audit trail, how-
ever, so you don’t see an Audit Trail check box accounting preference any more. 
An audit trail, by the way, simply keeps a list of who makes which changes to 
transactions. Accountants, predictably, love audit trails. Audit trails enable some-
one, such as your CPA or an Internal Revenue Service auditor, to come in after the 
fact and figure out why an account balance is what it is.
Setting the Bills Preferences
If you display the Preferences dialog box and click the Bills icon, you can set 
company-level preferences for handling vendor bills. You can, for example, specify 
that bills are considered to be due a certain number of days after their receipt by 
entering a value in the appropriate text box. You can also use these company-level  

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      119
preferences to specify that early-payment discounts should be used and to choose 
an account for recording the value of these discounts. (I don’t show you a figure 
of the Company Preferences tab of the Bills Preferences dialog box. It’s really not 
worth your time.)
Setting the Calendar Preferences
If you display the Preferences dialog box and click the Calendar icon, you can set 
your personal preferences for showing calendar information within QuickBooks, 
including a preference to remember previous calendar settings, the view used to 
show weeks, which transactions you want to appear on the calendar, and how you 
want calendar reminders to show. (As with the Bills Preferences, I don’t show you 
a figure of the My Preferences tab of the Calendar Preferences dialog box because 
the boxes are straightforward.)
Setting the Checking Preferences
If you display the Preferences dialog box and click the Checking icon, QuickBooks 
displays either the My Preferences tab, shown in Figure  3-4, or the Company 
Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-5.
FIGURE 3-4:  
The My Prefer-
ences tab of the 
Checking Prefer-
ences dialog box.

120      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The My Preferences tab of the Checking Preferences dialog box lets you tell Quick-
Books which account it should suggest as a default account when you open partic-
ular types of windows within QuickBooks. If you look closely at Figure 3-4, you see 
the Open the Write Checks box, which is the first check box on the tab. To the right 
of the Open the Write Checks box, you see the Form with X Account drop-down 
list. If you select the Open the Write Checks check box, you can select an account 
from the Form with X Account drop-down list. This setting tells QuickBooks to use 
or suggest the specified account every time you open the Write Checks window.
The My Preferences tab also includes check boxes that you can use to specify 
the default account for the Pay Bills window, the Pay Sales Tax window, and the 
Make Deposits window. If you have multiple checking accounts set up, setting 
the default accounts by using the My Preferences tab is a good idea. Setting these 
preferences makes it less likely that you’ll erroneously write checks on or pay bills 
from the wrong account.
The Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-5, provides check boxes that you 
can use to describe how checks work within QuickBooks:
»
» Print Account Names on Voucher: This check box lets you indicate to 
QuickBooks that it should print account names on the voucher portion of 
the check.
»
» Change Check Date When Non-Cleared Check Is Printed: Select this 
check box to tell QuickBooks to use the current system date as the printed 
check date.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks

»
» Start with Payee Field on Check: Select this check box to tell QuickBooks to 
place the insertion point, or text cursor, in the Payee field when you open the 
Write Checks window.
»
» Warn about Duplicate Check Numbers: Selecting this check box tells 
QuickBooks to alert you to duplicate check numbers. (You want to leave this 
check box selected, obviously, so that you don’t use duplicate or erroneous 
check numbers.)
»
» Autofill Payee Account Number in Check Memo: Select this check box to 
tell QuickBooks to automatically fill in the payee account number when you 
write a check. QuickBooks retrieves the account number for a payee from the 
Vendor list or from the Other Names list.
»
» Select Default Accounts to Use: These check boxes let you specify which 
account QuickBooks suggests when you open the Create Paychecks window 
or open the Pay Payroll Liabilities window. Essentially, then, these boxes let 
you tell QuickBooks which checking account you use to write payroll checks 
and to pay payroll liabilities, such as federal income tax withholding amounts.
»
» Bank Feeds: If you’ve turned on online banking for QuickBooks, QuickBooks 
provides option buttons you can use to change the way that online transac-
tion information appears in the online banking window. Book 3, Chapter 4 
discusses the QuickBooks online banking tool set.
Changing the Desktop View
Figure 3-6 shows the My Preferences tab of the Desktop View Preferences dia-
log box. The My Preferences tab provides View radio buttons  — One Window 
and Multiple Windows — that let you indicate whether QuickBooks should use 
one window or multiple windows for displaying all its information. The Multiple 
Windows option looks like older versions of Microsoft Windows. With multiple 
windows, an application such as QuickBooks displays multiple floating document 
windows within the application program window. If you have a question about 
how this works, your best bet is to simply try both view settings.
The Desktop radio buttons (see Figure  3-6) let you specify whether and when 
QuickBooks should save the current appearance, or view, of the desktop. You can 
select the Save When Closing Company radio button to tell QuickBooks that it 
should save the view of the desktop when you close a company. When you reopen 
a company, QuickBooks reuses this desktop view. You can also select the Save 
Current Desktop radio button to tell QuickBooks to save the current view and then 
reuse this view when QuickBooks later opens. If you don’t want to make changes 
to the default desktop view, select the Don’t Save the Desktop radio button.

122      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The Desktop check boxes let you specify whether QuickBooks should display the 
QuickBooks home page and use colored icons and a light background for the top 
icon bar. If you select a check box, QuickBooks adds the home page or tweaks the 
icon bar coloring.
The Windows Settings buttons let you access the Windows Display Properties 
and Windows Sounds Properties settings. Typically, you would make changes to 
Windows Display Properties and Windows Sounds Properties by using the Control 
Panel tools, but you can make changes from within QuickBooks by clicking these 
two buttons. (In actuality, when you click these buttons, QuickBooks starts the 
Control Panel tools.)
If you have questions about how the Windows Display Properties or Sounds Prop-
erties work, refer to the Windows Help file or to a good book, such as Windows 10 
For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
The Company Preferences available for the Desktop View Preferences let you 
specify what icons appear on the QuickBooks home page, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
The Customers set of check boxes, for example, lets you specify which customer-
related accounting tasks are available via icons on the home page. The Vendors 
check box lets you specify whether you want to enter and pay bills using the Enter 
Bills and Pay Bills command. Near the bottom of the Company Preferences tab of 
the Desktop View Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks supplies hyperlinks you can 
click to turn on and off the display of other accounting task icons.

CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      123
Setting Finance Charge Calculation Rules
The Finance Charge Preferences settings let you specify how QuickBooks should 
calculate finance charges on overdue invoices to customers. None of the My Pref-
erences options is available for finance charges  — only Company Preferences 
options. Because I describe how the Company Preferences tab of the Finance 
Charge Preferences dialog box works in Book 3, Chapter  1, I won’t repeat that 
information here.
Setting General Preferences
Figure 3-8 shows the My Preferences tab of the General Preferences dialog box. 
This tab provides check boxes that you can select to tell QuickBooks to do the 
following:
»
» To move the selection cursor from one field on the window to the next field 
when you press Enter
»
» To automatically open drop-down lists when typing
»
» To beep when you record a transaction
»
» To automatically place a decimal point two characters from the right end of 
the number
»
» To warn you when you’re editing an existing transaction

» To turn off pop-up messages for products and services
»
» To show ToolTips for clipped text
»
» To warn you when you’re deleting an existing transaction or some item on 
a list
»
» To run QuickBooks in the background even when you’re not using QuickBooks 
(to make QuickBooks start faster)
»
» To automatically recall account or transaction information — telling 
QuickBooks, for example, to automatically recall the last transaction for a 
particular customer, vendor, or employee
»
» To use either today’s date or the last entered date as the default date
»
» To keep custom item information changed as part of entering a transaction
If you have specific questions about the My Preferences check boxes that are avail-
able for the General Preferences options, click the Help button that appears along 
the right edge of the Preferences dialog box. QuickBooks provides brief but useful 
descriptions of how the Preferences options work and what they do.
Figure 3-9 shows the Company Preferences tab of the General Preferences dialog 
box. The Time Format radio buttons let you specify whether QuickBooks should 
show the minutes in an hour as a decimal value or as minutes. The Time Format 
radio button descriptions include examples of how these two approaches vary, so 
look closely at the dialog box if you have questions. The Company Preferences tab 
includes a check box that lets you specify that QuickBooks should always show 
FIGURE 3-8:  
The My Prefer-
ences tab of the 
General Prefer-
ences dialog box.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      125
years using four digits. And the Company Preferences tab includes a check box 
that you can select to tell QuickBooks that it shouldn’t update the name informa-
tion for a particular customer, vendor, employee, or other name when you’re sav-
ing a new transaction for that customer, vendor, employee, or other name.
Controlling Integrated Applications
The Integrated Applications Preferences aren’t personal, so no options are avail-
able on the My Preferences tab. The Company Preferences tab of the Integrated 
Applications Preferences dialog box, however, does control and track other appli-
cations or computer programs that open the QuickBooks company data files. 
Figure 3-10 shows the Company Preferences tab of the Integrated Applications 
Preferences dialog box.
The Don’t Allow Any Applications to Access This Company File check box, if 
selected, tells QuickBooks that it shouldn’t allow other applications to access 
this company data file. The check box titled Notify the User Before Running Any 
Application Whose Certificate Has Expired, if selected, tells QuickBooks that it 
shouldn’t allow any program whose security certificate is out of date to open the 
QuickBooks company data file without first notifying the user (that’s you).
The list box shows the names of the applications that previously requested access 
to the QuickBooks company data file. You can remove an application from this list 
by selecting the application and then clicking the Remove button. You can change 
the rules or properties that the QuickBooks program applies to access this other 
application by selecting the application and then clicking the Properties button.

126      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Controlling Inventory
No personal preferences are available for inventory tracking and control, but 
QuickBooks provides several Company Preferences features regarding inventory 
and items, as shown in Figure 3-11. You can turn the QuickBooks inventory and 
purchase order features on and off. You can specify you want to be warned if you 
enter a purchase order number you’ve previously used. And you can specify how 
QuickBooks determines whether you have or don’t have enough inventory to sell. 
(In the Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks, you can also indicate whether 
negative inventory balances are allowed.)

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      127
If you buy or sell an item using more than one unit of measure — say, you sell 
fabric both by the yard and by the bolt (the rolled-up fabric) — QuickBooks lets 
you quantify your inventory items by using more than a single unit of measure. 
If you’re interested in doing this, click the Enable button in the Unit of Measure 
section.
If your business operation processes multiple inventory receipts for a single 
vendor bill, multiple vendor bills for a single item receipt, or prepayments for 
inventory, you may want to consider enabling QuickBooks’s enhanced inventory 
receiving (EIR) feature if you’re using QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions. By turn-
ing on this feature, you probably can improve your inventory item counts and 
avoid the sorts of item count and QuickBooks errors that often occur in these more 
complicated inventory situations. You can’t turn off enhanced inventory receiving 
after you turn it on, however. Accordingly, research the details of the QuickBooks 
EIR feature (by clicking the Learn More hyperlink) or consult your accountant 
before you click the Enable button in the Enhanced Inventory Receiving section.
To have QuickBooks automatically update the item list’s purchase cost, sales 
price, and markup percentages, select the appropriate action by using the Auto-
matic Cost and Price Updates button. (Note: This button appears in Figure 3-11 
because I’m using the Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks. Other flavors 
of QuickBooks don’t include this option.)
Controlling How Jobs and Estimates Work
Because no personal preferences are available for Jobs & Estimates preferences, 
the My Preferences tab of this Preferences dialog box shows no options. You have 
several company preferences available regarding jobs and estimates, however, as 
shown in Figure 3-12. The Pending text box lets you describe what term or word 
should be used for jobs that have been submitted but haven’t been accepted or 
rejected. The Awarded text box lets you provide a term or description that you 
want to use within QuickBooks to identify those jobs that customers or clients 
have accepted. The default description of an awarded job is, cleverly, Awarded. The 
In Progress, Closed, and Not Awarded text boxes similarly let you describe what 
term you want to use for jobs that fit into these categories.
The Do You Create Estimates? radio buttons let you indicate to QuickBooks whether 
you want to create job estimates for customers. You select the radio button — Yes 
or No — that answers the question. The Do You Do Progress Invoicing? radio but-
tons let you indicate whether you do progress billing for jobs. The Warn about 
Duplicate Estimate Numbers check box, if selected, tells QuickBooks to warn you 
about using duplicate estimate numbers. The Don’t Print Items That Have Zero 

128      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Amount check box, if selected, tells QuickBooks not to print estimates that have 
zero balances.
Book 4, Chapter 5 talks more about setting up jobs and estimates. You may want 
to refer to it if you have questions about how project costing and job costing work 
within QuickBooks.
Dealing with Multiple Currencies
QuickBooks supports multiple currencies. To turn on QuickBooks’s multiple-
currencies feature, choose the Edit ➪   Preferences command, select the Multiple 
Currencies option in the list box, and click the Company Preferences tab. Then 
select the Yes I Use More Than One Currency button, and choose your home 
currency from the drop-down list.
After you tell QuickBooks that you’ll be working with multiple currencies, you 
need to set up a bank account for each extra currency in which you want to work 
(currencies in addition to your home currency). After that, you can indicate which 
currency a vendor or customer uses when you set up a new vendor or customer. 
You can also select a transaction currency for vendors or customers with which 
you haven’t yet transacted any business. You can’t change the currency for a ven-
dor or customer with which you’ve already transacted business in your home cur-
rency, however.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      129
After you’ve performed this setup work, you can work with foreign-currency 
units (euros rather than dollars, or vice versa) as you pay the foreign currency to 
vendors, collect the foreign currency from customers, and move money in and out 
of your foreign-currency bank account.
Furthermore, using the currency exchange information available in the Currency 
list (available when you choose Lists ➪   Currency List), QuickBooks converts 
foreign-currency amounts to home-currency amounts so you can prepare 
reports that use your home currency. QuickBooks, of course, updates its records 
concerning foreign exchange rates if you display the Currency List window, click 
the Activities button, and choose Download Latest Exchange Rates.
One final multiple-currency factoid: If you turn on the Multiple Currency feature 
within QuickBooks, QuickBooks sprinkles little currency reminders throughout its 
windows and dialog boxes. Amount boxes, for example, show a little abbreviation 
for the currency that goes into a particular box, thereby reminding you that in this 
particular text box, you’re supposed to enter, for example, British pounds.
Starting Integrated Payment Processing
The Payments preferences provide several check boxes and links you can use to 
control the way QuickBooks handles payments.
The Receive Payments check boxes, for example, let you indicate that you want 
to automatically apply and automatically calculate payments, as well as use the 
Undeposited Funds account as a temporary holding account for customer pay-
ments. (For more information about the Undeposited Funds account and customer 
payments, see Book 3, Chapter 1.)
The Payments preferences also let you indicate that you’ll allow customers to pay 
you using credit cards and bank transfers via the ACH (automated clearinghouse) 
system. If you indicate this, QuickBooks adds a link on invoices that customers 
can use to make credit card payments or bank transfers.
Not surprisingly, Intuit charges a modest fee for this service, so if you’re inter-
ested, pay close attention to current pricing — information that’s available when 
you check the boxes that turn on this feature. (At the time I’m writing this chap-
ter, the fee runs 2 to 3 percent for credit card payments and 50 cents for an ACH 
payment, and may require a modest monthly fee.)

Controlling How Payroll Works
The Payroll & Employees Preferences set includes only the Company Preferences 
tab, shown in Figure 3-13. The QuickBooks Payroll Features radio buttons let you 
tell QuickBooks how you want to handle payroll: using an outside payroll service 
such as Intuit Complete Payroll (select Complete Payroll Customers in this case), 
using QuickBooks payroll features (select the Full Payroll radio button), not using 
payroll at all (select the No Payroll radio button), or using the self-descriptive 
option, Online Payroll. Note that QuickBooks displays only radio buttons that 
make sense given the version of QuickBooks you’ve selected.
The Pay Stub & Voucher Printing button lets you tell QuickBooks what employee 
information to print on the payroll check: employee address, company address, 
sick-pay information, vacation-pay information, and pay period information. You 
can figure out how this works by clicking the button and looking at the dialog box 
that QuickBooks displays.
The Workers Compensation button lets you fiddle with the way that QuickBooks 
tracks information related to your workers’ compensation tax. The Sick and Vaca-
tion button lets you fine-tune how QuickBooks monitors employee sick- and 
vacation-pay accrual and use. Again, click either of these buttons to see a screen 
that provides more information about how the button works.
In roughly the middle of the Company Preferences tab of the Payroll & Employees 
Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks supplies several other check boxes and radio 
buttons:

»
» Copy Earnings Details from Previous Paycheck: Another duh.
»
» Recall Quantity Field on Paychecks: QuickBooks recalls or reuses paycheck 
quantity information from the last pay period’s paychecks. (The QuickBooks 
Help file suggests that you use this option when you have a “fixed quantity 
that occurs from paycheck to paycheck.” The Help file uses the example of 
tiered sales commissions where the commission amount is set for each tier.)
»
» Recall Hour Field on Paychecks: QuickBooks recalls or reuses hours-worked 
information from the last pay period’s paychecks. You use this option when 
you have a fixed number of hours that occurs from paycheck to paycheck.
»
» Job Costing, Class, and Item Tracking for Paycheck Expenses: QuickBooks 
lets you track payroll expenses not just by account, but also by job, class, or 
item.
»
» Assign One Class Per: The Entire Paycheck and Earnings Item options enable 
you to break wage expenses into classes more finely. You can indicate, for 
example, that you want to use a different class for each item that appears on 
an employee’s paycheck. (Note: These options appear only if classes are 
enabled.)
The Display Employee List By radio buttons let you choose how employee lists are 
sorted on reports: by first name or by last name.
If you click the Employee Defaults button, QuickBooks displays a dialog box that 
you can use to set employee payroll default information, such as deductions for 
taxes or health insurance.
Finally, at the bottom of the dialog box, QuickBooks provides two other options for 
handling payroll. The Mark New Employees As Sales Reps check box, if selected, 
does what you’d expect: It marks new employees that you add to the Employee list 
as sales reps. And the check box titled Display Employee Social Security Numbers 
in Headers on Reports, if selected, also does what you’d expect: It adds employee 
Social Security numbers to reports.
Telling QuickBooks How Reminders  
Should Work
The My Preferences tab of the Reminders Preferences dialog box consists of just 
one check box, which you can use to tell QuickBooks that you want to see the 
Reminders list when you open a company file. Because the My Preferences tab 
includes only a single check box, I don’t show it here as a figure.

132      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
The Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-14, provides a bunch of radio 
buttons that you can use to specify how QuickBooks should remind you of account-
ing and bookkeeping tasks that you need to complete: Checks to Print, Paychecks 
to Print, Invoices/Credit Memos to Print, Overdue Invoices, Almost Due Invoices, 
Sales Receipts to Print, Sales Orders to Print, Inventory to Reorder, Assembly 
Items to Build, Bills to Pay, Memorized Transactions Due, Money to Deposit, Pur-
chase Orders to Print, To Do Notes, and Open Authorizations to Capture.
For each of these accounting or bookkeeping tasks, you indicate whether you want 
to see a reminder for the item in the Summary list that appears in the QuickBooks 
Company Preferences Reminders list. You can also choose to actually see the list 
of tasks — such as the list of checks to print — or you can indicate that you don’t 
want to be reminded of some particular category of accounting or bookkeeping. 
For some of the reminder notes, you indicate how many work days in advance 
you want to be reminded. If you indicate that you want to be reminded to print 
checks, for example, you must indicate how many days before the check date that 
you want the reminder to appear. You do this by entering a numeral in one of the 
Remind Me text boxes.
Specifying Reports & Graphs Preferences
The My Preferences tab of the Reports & Graphs Preferences dialog box is shown 
in Figure 3-15. This tab provides radio buttons that you can use to indicate how 
QuickBooks should refresh reports when the information upon which the report is 
FIGURE 3-14:  
The Company 
Preferences tab 
of the Remind-
ers Preferences 
dialog box.

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      133
based changes. The default refresh option is Refresh Automatically. You can also 
select the Prompt Me to Refresh radio button to have QuickBooks (politely) suggest 
that you refresh a report only whenever the data changes. (You may not want to 
refresh automatically if you have a large data set and many reports. Refreshing a 
report can be rather time-consuming.) You can also select the Don’t Refresh radio 
button if you don’t want or don’t need to be reminded about refreshing a report.
The check box titled Prompt Me to Modify Report Options before Opening a Report, 
if selected, tells QuickBooks to open the Modify Report window whenever you cre-
ate a report. You can use the Modify Report window to control what information 
is included in a report (such as what date range the report is based on) and other 
reporting options as well. If this check box isn’t selected, QuickBooks creates a 
report by using the default reporting options.
The Graphs Only check boxes let you control the way QuickBooks graphs report 
information. You can select the Draw Graphs in 2D check box to tell QuickBooks 
to draw two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional graphs. (QuickBooks 
draws two-dimensional graphs much more quickly, so you may want to use two-
dimensional graphs.) Note that two-dimensional graphs are visually more precise 
than three-dimensional graphs. You can also select the Use Patterns check box 
to tell QuickBooks to draw a graph that uses crosshatching patterns rather than 
colors for the different pieces of a chart.
For a complete discussion of the Modify Reports window, take a look at the dis-
cussion in Book 4, Chapter 2.

134      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
Figure 3-16 shows the Company Preferences tab of the Reports & Graphs Pref-
erences dialog box. This tab provides several useful options for default report 
generation rules. The Summary Reports Basis radio buttons, for example, let you 
indicate whether the default accounting method used to create a report should be 
accrual-basis accounting or cash-basis accounting. The Aging Reports radio but-
tons let you specify how the age of an invoice or bill should be calculated: from 
the due date or from the transaction date. The Reports - Show Accounts By radio 
buttons let you specify how account information appears in reports: account name 
only, description only, or both name and description.
Two other options are especially noteworthy. The Classify Cash button displays a 
dialog box that lets you indicate whether changes in a particular account balance 
should appear in the operating, investing, or financing portion of the statement 
of cash flows.
If you’re not a professional accountant, you want to get your CPA’s help in making 
changes to this area of QuickBooks. The rules for presenting a statement of cash 
flows are quite involved.
If you clear the Default Formatting for Reports check box and click the Format but-
ton, QuickBooks displays the Report Format Preferences dialog box, which lets you 
customize the report header and footer information. Figure 3-17 shows the Header/
Footer tab of the Report Format Preferences dialog box. The Show Header Infor-
mation check boxes let you specify what information should appear in the report 
header area. The Show Footer Information check boxes let you make the same 
specifications for the report footer. The Alignment drop-down list in the Page Lay-
out section lets you specify how information should be aligned on the report page.

Figure 3-18 shows the Fonts & Numbers tab of the Report Format Preferences dia-
log box. This tab you specify what font and formatting you want to use for bits of 
report information. If you want to change the font for the report’s column labels, for 
example, click the Column Labels entry in the Change Font For list box; then click 
the Change Font button. QuickBooks displays a Font Formatting dialog box (not 
shown) that lets you specify the font, font style, point size, and other special effects.
If you’re confused about changing report formatting, check out Book 4, Chapter 2. 
It talks about all this stuff.

Setting Sales & Customers Preferences
I won’t show you the My Preferences tab. The personalized preferences for deal-
ing with sales and customers are pretty basic. The tab lets you specify whether 
QuickBooks should prompt you to invoice a customer for time or costs you’ve 
previously said are billable to that customer.
The company preferences deserve more explanation. Figure  3-19 shows the 
Company Preferences tab of the Sales & Customers Preferences dialog box. The 
Sales Forms options relate to the invoice information you supply to customers. 
The Usual Shipping Method drop-down list lets you specify the default shipping 
method. The Usual FOB text box lets you set the default free on board (FOB) point. 
You can select a check box to tell QuickBooks whether it should warn you when 
you use duplicate invoice numbers.
The Choose Template for Invoice Packing Slip drop-down list in the Miscellaneous 
section lets you specify how packing slips should look.
The Enable Price Levels radio buttons  — No Custom Pricing or Enable Price 
Levels — let you turn on QuickBooks price levels features. I won’t say more about 
this here. Price levels are discussed in more detail in Book 3, Chapter 3.
The Sales Orders check boxes let you control how the QuickBooks sales orders 
work, including whether you even want to use sales orders, how numbering 
should work, and how they should look when they print. The Sales Orders options 
also include drop-down list boxes you can use to specify how sales orders should

look and a check box you can select to tell QuickBooks not to sell more stuff to 
customers with overdue balances.
Specifying How Sales Are Taxed
Although no personal preferences are available for sales tax, company preferences 
do exist. Figure 3-20 shows the Company Preferences tab of the Sales Tax Prefer-
ences dialog box. The Do You Charge Sales Tax? radio buttons, which appear at the 
top of the tab, control whether you can charge sales tax within QuickBooks. You 
select the radio button — Yes or No — that answers the question.
The Taxable Item Code and Non-Taxable Item Code drop-down lists let you define 
what code QuickBooks should use to identify taxable and nontaxable sales. By 
default, QuickBooks uses the clever “tax” code for taxable sales and the equally 
clever “non” code for nontaxable sales. You can select the Add New entry from 
either drop-down list, however, and use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays 
to create your own taxable and nontaxable codes.
The Set Up Sales Tax Item and Assign Sales Tax Codes sections let you set up an 
item for the sales tax that you charge on invoices. You can indicate the default (or 
most common) sales tax item that you want to include by entering this sales tax 
item name in the Your Most Common Sales Tax Item combo box. To add the sales 
tax item, choose Add New from this drop-down list and complete the dialog box 
that QuickBooks displays. The New Item dialog box lets you name the sales tax 
item and identify the sales tax rate.
FIGURE 3-20:  
The Company 
Preferences tab 
of the Sales Tax 
Preferences 
dialog box.

138      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
You can also add a new sales tax item by clicking the Add Sales Tax Item button.
The Taxable Item Code and Non-Taxable Item Code drop-down lists let you select 
the code words to designate invoice items as subject to sales tax. The check box 
titled Identify Taxable Amounts as “T” for “Taxable” When Printing, if selected, 
tells QuickBooks to flag taxable amounts on an invoice with the code T.
The When Do You Owe Sales Tax? radio buttons let you indicate when the taxing 
authority says you owe sales tax: as of the invoice date (which means that the 
taxing authority requires accrual-basis accounting) or upon receipt of payment 
(which means that the taxing authority allows cash-basis accounting).
The When Do You Pay Sales Tax? radio buttons (Monthly, Quarterly, and Annually) 
let you tell QuickBooks how frequently you must remit sales tax amounts. 
You select the radio button that corresponds to your sales tax payment frequency.
Book 2, Chapter 2 describes how to set up sales tax items.
Setting the Search Preferences
The My Preferences tab of the Search Preferences dialog box provides a check box 
you can use to indicate that you want the Search box to appear on the QuickBooks 
icon toolbar. (This seems pretty self-explanatory, but if you’re confused, check 
the box, click OK, and then look at the way that QuickBooks has modified your 
icon toolbar.)
The Company Preferences tab of the Search Preferences dialog box (not shown) lets 
you specify how frequently QuickBooks updates the index of company data file and 
menu items that are used when you search for data within the QuickBooks pro-
gram. By default, QuickBooks does its update every hour, but you can request more 
frequent or less frequent updates. An update of the index takes a few minutes, and 
during the update, QuickBooks runs more slowly. The Search Company Preferences 
tab also includes a button you can click to demand an immediate update of the index.
Setting the Send Forms Preferences
The My Preferences tab of the Send Forms Preferences dialog box lets you check 
a box to specify whether the To Be E-Mailed check box is selected for customer 
invoices; click an option button to specify when emailed forms should be processed 

Fine-Tuning QuickBooks
CHAPTER 3  Fine-Tuning QuickBooks      139
with web mail (such as Gmail or QuickBooks email); and provides buttons you can 
click to build a list of email accounts you want to use for web mail.
The Company Preferences tab of the Send Forms Preferences dialog box is shown 
in Figure 3-21. The Company Preferences tab lets you specify the default message 
text, message subject, and salutation for emailed invoices, estimates, and state-
ments. To use the Company Preferences tab, you use the Show drop-down list to 
specify which type of message text you want to change. Next, click the message 
you want to change; then click the Edit button. When QuickBooks displays the Edit 
Email Template dialog box (not shown), you change the default message however 
you want.
Book 3, Chapter 1 talks about invoicing customers and emailing customer invoices.
Fine-Tuning the Service Connection
The My Preferences tab of the Service Connection Preferences dialog box provides 
two check boxes you can select to control how QuickBooks works when you’re 
making web connections, as shown in Figure 3-22. One check box gives you the 
option of saving downloaded files. The other tells QuickBooks not to close your 
web browser when it finishes using the web.
For the Service Connection Preferences dialog box, two Company Preferences options 
are available. You can, for example, indicate whether QuickBooks should automati-
cally connect to QuickBooks Services without asking for a password or whether 
FIGURE 3-21:  
The Company 
Preferences 
tab of the Send 
Forms Prefer-
ences dialog box.

140      BOOK 2  Getting Ready to Use QuickBooks
it should always ask for a password. To make this decision, you simply select the 
appropriate radio button. You can also select the Allow Background Downloading of 
Service Messages check box to tell QuickBooks that background collection of mes-
sages is okay. (If you select this check box, QuickBooks downloads new messages 
during idle times so that it doesn’t slow your other Internet activities.)
Controlling Spell Checking
No company preferences exist for the Spelling Preferences dialog box, but the My 
Preferences tab (shown in Figure 3-23) provides several options for controlling 
how spell checking works for you within QuickBooks. Select the check box titled 
Always Check Spelling Before Printing, Saving, or Sending Supported Forms if you 
want to have automatic spell checking performed before you actually distribute a 
document to an outside party, such as a customer or vendor.
You can use the Ignore Words With check boxes to tell QuickBooks not to spell-
check words or phrases that aren’t going to appear correctly spelled because 
they aren’t real words. Select the Internet Addresses check box, for example, to 
tell QuickBooks that it shouldn’t check Internet URL addresses. And select the 
All UPPERCASE Letters check box to tell QuickBooks that it shouldn’t attempt to 
spell-check words that are acronyms and abbreviations, such as OK and ASAP.
QuickBooks also lets you remove custom-spelled words from your spell-checking 
dictionary. (You add custom-spelled words during spell checking by telling 
QuickBooks that a word flagged as possibly misspelled is, in fact, spelled correctly. 
To do this, click the Add button when the Check Spelling dialog box appears.)

Controlling How 1099 Tax Reporting Works
No personal preferences exist for 1099 tax reporting. Company preferences exist, 
however, as indicated by the Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 3-24. This 
tab lets you tell QuickBooks when you’re required to file 1099-MISC forms (answer 
the Do You File 1099-MISC Forms? question by selecting the Yes radio button). The 
tab also lets you map QuickBooks accounts to the different boxes on the 1099 form 
you use to report payments to independent contractors. (To do this, click the Click 
Here hyperlink.) Confer with your tax adviser if you have questions about these boxes 
or the 1099 reporting threshold amounts, or visit the IRS website at www.irs.gov.

Setting Time & Expenses Preferences
Figure 3-25 shows the Company Preferences tab of the Time & Expenses Prefer-
ences dialog box. To turn on time tracking within QuickBooks, enable Do You 
Track Time? by selecting the Yes radio button. You can also use the First Day 
of Work Week drop-down list to indicate which day should appear first on the 
Weekly Time Sheet window. (This setting is what you use to describe billable time 
for the week.) Book 3, Chapter 1 talks about billing for time in more detail. You 
may want to look there if you have questions about tracking time and billing for 
that time.
You may need to scroll down the list of Preferences to see the Time & Expenses 
preference settings.
Use the Invoicing Options check boxes to indicate how you want to track reim-
bursed expenses. To indicate that you sometimes want to base invoices on accu-
mulated time and expenses, select the Create Invoices from a List of Time and 
Expenses check box. Furthermore, to indicate that you want to track reimbursed 
expenses that you bill and then later collect from customers or clients as income, 
select the Track Reimbursed Expenses As Income check box. The Default Markup 
Percentage text box lets you specify a default retail markup percentage to use in 
your pricing (although you should double-check that it’s showing up properly in 
estimates before you count on it). The Default Markup Account drop-down list 
lets you specify which account QuickBooks should use for tracking your markups.

CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      145
Invoicing Customers
Q
uickBooks provides several tools for invoicing your customers. This chap-
ter describes these tools, as well as a handful of related tools for recording 
customer payments and for issuing credit memos.
If you’ve already been invoicing customers by using some manual method  —  
perhaps you’ve been preparing invoices with a word processor  — you’ll find 
QuickBooks to be a godsend. QuickBooks not only makes invoicing and related 
tasks easier, but also collects invoice information, recording this information in 
the QuickBooks data file. Happily, this means that you get the extra benefit of 
recording accounting transactions simply by using QuickBooks for invoicing.
Choosing an Invoice Form
QuickBooks allows you to use an invoice form that matches the requirements of 
your business. Businesses that sell products — such as retailers and ­wholesalers — 
need an invoice that includes descriptions of the product items that are sold. 
­Businesses that sell services  — such as law, architectural, engineering, and 
­consulting firms — need an invoice that appropriately describes these services. 
Businesses that sell both products and services need a blend of attributes.

146      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Fortunately, QuickBooks lets you choose the invoice form that best matches 
your business. To choose an invoice form, display the Create Invoices window by 
choosing the Customers ➪   Create Invoices command. When QuickBooks displays 
the Create Invoices window, use the Template drop-down list, which appears in 
the top-right portion of the window, to choose the invoice form that you want. 
This drop-down list provides choices such as an attorney’s invoice, a finance 
charge invoice, a fixed-fee invoice, a product invoice, a service invoice, and a 
professional invoice. Choose the invoice template that seems to best match your 
business. QuickBooks redraws the Create Invoices window when you choose a new 
invoice form template. This means that you can see what an invoice form template 
looks like simply by choosing an option from the Template drop-down list.
Customizing an Invoice Form
Although you can choose a predefined invoice form template for your invoices, 
QuickBooks gives you more flexibility than that. You can also create custom 
invoice form templates to design an invoice that looks just the way you want.  
To do this, you can start with one of the basic invoice form templates and then 
customize it so that it perfectly matches your requirements.
Choosing a template to customize
To choose a template to customize, display the Create Invoices window by choos-
ing the Customers ➪   Create Invoices command. Then select the template that 
most closely matches what you want your ultimate invoice to look like from the 
­Template drop-down list.
Reviewing the Additional  
Customization options
QuickBooks’s form customization tools easily confuse new QuickBooks users. But 
typically, the way to start any customization is to fiddle with what QuickBooks 
calls its Additional Customization options.
To perform this fiddling, click the Create Invoice window’s Formatting tab and 
then click the Customize Data Layout button. You can’t use the Additional Custom-
ization dialog box if you’re working with one of the default invoice ­templates — 
only if you’re working with a copy. Accordingly, QuickBooks may prompt you to 
make a copy of an invoice template when you click the Additional Customization 
button. In any event, QuickBooks displays the Additional Customization dialog 

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      147
box, as shown in Figure 1-1. This dialog box gives you control of both the informa-
tion that appears on your invoices and the way invoices print.
Specifying header information
The Header tab of the Additional Customization dialog box (refer to Figure 1-1) 
lets you specify what information goes on the top portion of the Create Invoices 
window and in the top area of an actual printed invoice form. This information, 
called the header, provides the invoice number, the invoice date, and the billing 
and shipping information. You can also choose how information is labeled by fill-
ing in or editing the contents of the text boxes. The Default Title check boxes, for 
example, let you specify whether the form title should appear in the screen version 
of the invoice (this would be inside the Create Invoices window) and in the printed 
version of the invoice. The Default Title text box lets you specify what the form 
title should be. In a similar fashion, the Date check boxes let you specify whether 
the date should appear in both the screen and print versions of the invoice, as well 
as what label should be used to describe the invoice date. Figure 1-1 uses the clever 
descriptive text Invoice as the invoice form’s title.
As you make these customizations, QuickBooks updates the Preview box, shown 
on the right half of the Additional Customization dialog box, so you can see what 
your changes look like.
FIGURE 1-1:  
The Header tab 
of the Additional 
Customization 
dialog box.

148      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
If you don’t need a particular piece of information in an invoice, don’t select the 
Screen and Print check boxes for that bit of data. Leaving these check boxes dese-
lected tells QuickBooks that it shouldn’t include that piece of header information 
in the window or print version of the invoice form.
Specifying columns information
The columns portion of an invoice describes in detail the items for which an 
invoice bills. Product invoice columns describe the specific products, including 
price and quantity; they also describe the items being invoiced. A service invoice’s 
columns describe the specific services being billed. As you may guess from look-
ing closely at Figure 1-2, the Columns tab of the Additional Customization dialog 
box looks like the Header tab. You use the Screen and Print check boxes to indicate 
whether a particular piece of column-level information should appear as a column 
in the Create Invoices window or in the actual created invoice. Similarly, you use 
the Title text boxes to provide the descriptive labels that QuickBooks uses in the 
Create Invoices window and in the printed invoice form.
The only unusual options shown on the Columns tab are the Order text boxes (see 
Figure 1-2). These boxes let you indicate the order (from left to right) in which 
the columns should appear. If the item number or code should appear in the first 
column on the left, for example, you enter the value 1 in the Item row’s Order box.
FIGURE 1-2:  
The Columns tab 
of the Additional 
Customization 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      149
Specifying prog columns information
The “prog columns” portion of an invoice provides information relevant to situa-
tions in which you’re using progress billings. You can click the Prog Cols tab of the 
Additional Customization dialog box to add and remove such information as the 
ordered amount, the previously invoiced amount, and any back-ordered amounts.
The Header, Columns, and Prog Cols tabs let you make changes in your invoice 
forms, but don’t get too nervous about making perfect changes the first time. You 
can easily see exactly how your changes look by using the Preview box (if your 
eyesight is better than mine) or by clicking OK and then carefully reviewing the 
new version of the Create Invoices window. If you realize that you’ve made an 
error — perhaps you’ve used the wrong bit of descriptive text, or you’ve incor-
rectly ordered the columns — you can customize your invoice again and thereby 
fix your earlier mistakes.
Specifying footer information
The Footer tab of the Additional Customization dialog box lets you specify what 
information appears in the Create Invoices window below the columns area and 
in the actual printed invoice below the columns area. As Figure 1-3 indicates, the 
footer information includes a customer message, the invoice total, payments and 
credit information, a balance-due field, and (optionally) a longer text box. You 
work with the Footer tab in the same manner that you work with other tabs. If 
you want some bit of information to appear, select the Screen check box and the 
Print check box. To change the bit of text that QuickBooks uses, edit the contents 
of the Title text box.
Specifying print information
The Print tab of the Additional Customization dialog box, shown in Figure 1-4, 
lets you exercise a bit of control over how QuickBooks prints invoices that use 
the template you’ve customized. The radio buttons at the top of the tab let you 
specify that when printing this particular invoice template, QuickBooks should 
use the regular old invoice printer settings or other, special print settings. The 
Print settings also let you tell QuickBooks how it should number the pages of a 
multiple-page invoice.
You can return all the customized invoice settings to their default condition by 
clicking the Default button. When you do this, however, you remove any changes 
or customizations that you’ve made.

CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      151
Moving on to Basic Customization
The Additional Customization dialog box (refer to Figure 1-4, for example), pro-
vides a Basic Customization button. If you click this button, QuickBooks displays 
the Basic Customization dialog box, shown in Figure 1-5, which provides several 
easy-to-make customization choices.
To identify which invoice form template you want to customize, click the Manage 
Templates button; then, when QuickBooks displays the Manage Templates dialog 
box (see Figure 1-6), choose the invoice template you want to customize. Quick-
Books initially supplies a custom invoice template and a finance charge template 
that you can customize.
Alternatively, you can select one of these existing templates and click Copy to 
create and then customize it. When you click OK, QuickBooks closes the Manage 
Templates dialog box and returns you to the Basic Customization dialog box.
Logo, please
To add a logo to your invoices, select the Use Logo check box (shown in Figure 1-5). 
Then, when QuickBooks displays the Select Image dialog box (not shown), use it 
to select the graphic-image file that shows your logo. The Select Image dialog box 
works like a standard Windows open-file dialog box.
FIGURE 1-5:

­Customization 
dialog box.

152      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Color you beautiful
To add color to your invoices — say you have a color printer, and you don’t care 
whether you spend a small fortune on colored ink — select the color scheme you 
want to use from the Select Color Scheme drop-down list. Then click the Apply 
Color Scheme button.
Fiddle with invoice fonts
You can choose the font that QuickBooks uses for the bits of text that go into an 
invoice. Just select the bit of text you want in the Change Font For list box and 
then click the Change Font button. QuickBooks displays the Example dialog box, 
shown in Figure 1-7. Use its Font, Font Style, and Size boxes to specify what the 
selected bit of text should look like. The Example dialog box includes a Sample box 
that shows how your font changes look. When you complete your specification of 
the font, click OK.
Specify Company & Transaction information
The Company & Transaction Information options, also shown in Figure  1-5, let 
you indicate what information should appear on the form template. You select the 
check box that corresponds to the bit of information. If you want the company name 
to appear in the invoice form, for example — which means that you aren’t using 
­letterhead or preprinted invoice forms — select the Company Name check box.
FIGURE 1-6:  
The Manage 
Templates 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      153
If you need to change some bit of company information, click the Update Infor-
mation button. QuickBooks displays the Company Information dialog box (not 
shown), which you can use to edit or update your company name, address, tele-
phone number, and so on.
Working with the Layout Designer tool
Okay. Perhaps you’ve used the Basic Customization dialog box to make some 
changes in your invoice’s appearance, and you haven’t been satisfied. Maybe 
you’ve gone the extra mile and noodled around with the Additional Customization 
dialog box to make further changes, and maybe even that hasn’t left you happy 
with the appearance of your invoice.
Do you have any additional recourse? Are you stuck with an invoice that doesn’t 
look right or that doesn’t work for your organization? Heck, no!
If you click the Layout Designer button, which is available in both the Basic Cus-
tomization and Additional Customization dialog boxes, QuickBooks displays the 
Layout Designer dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-8. The Layout Designer dia-
log box lets you move invoice information around in the actual printed invoice. 
Your best bet for finding out how to work with the Layout Designer tool is to 
experiment with it. My recommendation is that you create an example invoice 
FIGURE 1-7:  
The Example 
dialog box.

154      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
form template — something you don’t really care about — and then use this new 
invoice form template for some goofing around.
Here are some of the things that you may want to try:
»
» Moving and resizing objects: You can move and resize objects in the form 
pretty easily. To move some bit of the form, first select the bit by clicking it. 
Then use the arrow keys or drag the mouse to move the selected bit. You can 
resize the selected bit in a similar way. Resize the selected object by dragging 
the black squares (called resizing handles), which show that the object 
is selected.
When moving and resizing invoice form objects, keep two points in mind:
•	 You can select the Show Envelope Window check box to have QuickBooks 
draw envelope windows in the invoice form to show you where these 
elements appear. You want to have envelope windows shown to make 
sure that your customized invoice still has its address information showing 
through.
•	 You can click the Grid button to display the Grid and Snap Settings dialog 
box (not shown). This dialog box provides two check boxes where you can 
indicate whether QuickBooks should use a grid (those are the dots you 
FIGURE 1-8:  
The Layout 
Designer 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      155
see) to more accurately line up invoice objects in the form. The Grid and 
Snap Settings dialog box also includes a Snap to Grid box so you can tell 
QuickBooks that it should make gridlines sticky. Sticky gridlines automati-
cally attract invoice objects so that you can more easily line up the objects 
against the gridlines. The Grid and Snap Settings dialog box also includes a 
Grid Spacing box that you can use to specify how wide or narrow 
QuickBooks should draw gridlines.
»
» Selecting objects: You can select multiple objects in the invoice by dragging 
the mouse. To do so, click at a point above the top-leftmost object that 
you want to select, and drag the mouse to a point just below the bottom- 
rightmost object that you want to select. As you drag the mouse from one 
corner to the other, QuickBooks draws a rectangle. Any object that’s inside 
this rectangle when you release the mouse gets selected.
»
» Resizing multiple objects: You can change the height, width, and size of 
multiple selected objects by clicking the Make Same Width, Make Same 
Height, and Make Same Size buttons. To use these Make Same buttons, you 
first select the objects that you want to make the same.
»
» Changing column widths: You can change the width of columns in the 
column area of the invoice form by clicking the Column object. After you do 
this, and QuickBooks selects the columns area, drag the column divider line 
left or right to resize the column. Note that if you make column 1 narrower, 
QuickBooks makes column 2 wider to take up the space. Also note that you 
can resize the entire column area in the manner described in the preceding 
point.
»
» Positioning text within fields: If you click an invoice object and then click the 
Properties button, QuickBooks displays the Properties dialog box, shown in 
Figure 1-9. The Properties dialog box includes a Text tab that lets you specify 
how text should appear within an invoice object area. The dialog box also 
includes a Border tab that lets you specify whether QuickBooks should draw a 
border along the edges of the invoice object. You also have the option to add 
a solid background color to any box using the Background tab,
»
» Changing fonts: You can change the font used for the selected object by 
clicking the Properties button, clicking the Text tab of the Properties dialog 
box, and then clicking the Font button that appears on this tab. QuickBooks 
displays the Example dialog box (refer to Figure 1-7) . The Example dialog box 
lets you choose a font; font style; a point size; and special effects, such as 
strikeout, underlining, and color.
»
» Adjusting margins: If you click the Margins button, QuickBooks displays the 
Margins dialog box (not shown), which includes Top, Bottom, Left, and Right 
text boxes that you use to specify the margin around the invoice. The default 
or initial margin settings equal half an inch.

156      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Center a selected object in an invoice form by clicking the Center button to activate 
the Layout Designer. You can click the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to see more 
or less detail. If you want to undo your most recent change, click Undo, or click the 
Redo button to undo your last undo option.
After you use the Layout Designer to make whatever changes are appropriate to 
your new invoice form template, click OK to save your changes.
Working with the web-based  
Forms Customization tool
QuickBooks provides one other form design tool that you can tap to create invoice 
forms (and other QuickBooks forms) that more closely match your requirements: 
the web-based QuickBooks Forms Customization tool.
You access this tool from the Create Invoices window by clicking the Customize 
Design button on the Formatting tab. When you do this, QuickBooks displays a 
web page that steps you through a full-fledged graphic design session for the 
invoice form. To use this approach, you simply follow the web page’s instructions.
Invoicing a Customer
To invoice a customer, use the Create Invoices window to identify the customer 
and specify the amount that the customer owes. To display the Create Invoices 
window, choose the Customers ➪   Create Invoices command. When you do, Quick-
Books displays a Create Invoices window like the one shown in Figure 1-10. Note, 
FIGURE 1-9:  
The Properties 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      157
however, that the Create Invoices window you see may not look exactly like the 
one shown in Figure 1-10. As previously described, you can use more than one 
type of invoice form. You can also choose to customize an invoice form so that it 
perfectly matches your business requirements. In the following steps, I describe 
generally how to invoice a customer. The specific steps that you take may be ever- 
so-slightly different if you’re working with a different invoice form template.
If you want to declutter your Create Invoices window, you may want to close the 
Open Window List along the left edge of the QuickBooks window to provide more 
room. You can close your Open Window List by clicking its close box (the small 
box marked with an X that appears in the top-right corner of the list). To redisplay 
the Open Window List after you’ve closed it, choose View ➪   Open Window List. You 
can also collapse the History panel on the right edge of the QuickBooks window to 
provide more room for invoice information.
After you display the Create Invoices window, take the following steps to invoice 
a customer:
1.	 Identify the customer and, if appropriate, the job.
To do this, select the customer or customer and job combination from the 
Customer:Job drop-down list. Don’t worry about this “job” business if you aren’t 
FIGURE 1-10:  
The Create 
Invoices window.

158      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
familiar with it. I describe how jobs work in Book 4, Chapter 5. You should 
understand how customers work, however. You must identify the specific 
customer you’re invoicing by selecting that customer from the Customer:Job 
list. If the customer is a new customer that you haven’t yet invoiced or 
described in the Customer List, enter a brief name for the customer — such as 
an abbreviation of the customer’s business name — in the Customer:Job list. 
QuickBooks then indicates that the customer doesn’t yet exist in the Customer 
List and asks whether you want to add the customer; indicate that you do. 
When prompted, supply the customer information that QuickBooks requests.
For more information about adding customers in QuickBooks, refer to Book 2, 
Chapter 2.
You can also classify an invoice as fitting into a particular category by using 
the Class drop-down list. Don’t worry at this point about using class tracking. 
Book 4, Chapter 4 describes how you can use classes to get a better handle on 
your business’s finances.
2.	 Confirm or provide new invoice header information.
After you identify the customer, QuickBooks fills out the Date, Invoice, and Bill 
To fields, and possibly the Ship To field. You probably don’t need to change any 
of this information. You should review the information shown in these boxes 
to make sure that it’s correct. Typically, for example, you wouldn’t invoice 
someone unless you’ve already shipped the product or provided the service. 
Therefore, you probably should confirm that the invoice date follows the 
product shipment date or the provision-of-service date. You may also want to 
confirm that the Ship To address is correct.
3.	 Provide or confirm the invoice field information.
Invoices include field information that records items such as purchase order 
numbers, payment terms, ship date, and shipping method. You should make 
sure that whatever QuickBooks shows in these text boxes is correct. If a 
customer has provided you a purchase-order number, for example, enter that 
number in the P.O. Number box. Confirm that the payment terms shown in 
the Terms box are correct. Confirm that the date shown in the Ship field is 
correct. These boxes are all in a single line above the detailed description of 
the item(s) you are selling. If the billing and shipping addresses are different, 
make sure the Ship To box in the upper-right portion of the invoice is filled in 
properly. Not all these fields need to be filled for every invoice, but you want to 
supply any information that makes it easier for a customer to pay an invoice, 
tie an invoice to his or her purchasing records, and figure out how and when 
an item is being shipped.
4.	 Describe the items sold.
How the columns area of your invoice looks really depends on whether you’re 
selling products or services. Figure 1-11 shows the columns area for products. 

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      159
The columns area for a service looks simpler because you don’t provide much 
information when describing service items. In the columns area, you want to 
describe each item — each product or service — for which an invoice bills. To 
do this, you use a single row for each item. The first item that you want to bill 
for, then, goes in row 1 of the columns area. For each item, you enter the quan-
tity ordered, the code for the item, and a price or rate. QuickBooks retrieves an 
item description from your Item list and places this data in the Description 
column. QuickBooks also calculates the amount billed for the item by multiply-
ing the quantity by the price or rate. You can edit both the Description and 
Amount fields, however. If you edit the Amount field, QuickBooks recalculates 
the Price Each field by dividing the amount by the quantity.
To enter additional items in the invoice, enter additional rows. Each item that 
you want to bill for — each item that should appear as a separate charge in 
the invoice — appears as a row in the columns area. If you want to invoice a 
customer for some product, one line in the columns area of the invoice is 
used for that product. If you want to charge a customer for freight, one line of the 
invoice area describes that freight charge. If you want to bill a customer for sales 
tax, again, one line or row of the columns area shows that sales tax charge.
Discounts represent tricky line items to include in an invoice. For this reason, 
I provide an example of how a discount item appears in an invoice. Assume that 
FIGURE 1-11:  
How a Create 
Invoices window 
may look when 
complete.

160      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
you want to grant some customer a 10 percent discount. To do this, as you 
now know (or should be able to guess), you include a discount line item in your 
invoice. But although QuickBooks includes a discount item in its Item list, a 
discount percentage can be applied only to the previous line item in the invoice. 
For this reason, QuickBooks also supplies a subtotal line item. You use a subtotal 
line item to total all the previous items shown in the invoice. By subtotaling all 
the product items shown in the invoice in Figure 1-11, for example, the business 
can grant the customer a 10 percent discount on these products.
You need to include the percentage symbol to tell QuickBooks to calculate a 
discount equal to a percentage of the subtotal. If you omit the percentage 
symbol, QuickBooks assumes that you want a dollar discount, not a percent-
age discount. In Figure 1-11, for example, omitting the percentage symbol 
would turn the 10 percent discount into a $10 discount.
5.	 Use the Customer Message box at the bottom of the Create Invoices 
window to supply a customer message that appears at the bottom of the 
invoice.
If you’ve created a custom invoice form template that includes other footer 
information, these footer boxes also appear at the bottom of the Create 
Invoices window. You can use them to collect and transfer additional footer 
information.
6.	 (Optional) Check your spelling.
If you click the Spelling button, which appears along the top edge of the Create 
Invoices window’s Formatting tab, QuickBooks checks the spelling of the words 
that you use in the invoice. If QuickBooks finds no spelling errors, it displays a 
message telling you that the spelling check is complete. If QuickBooks finds a 
spelling error — product code abbreviations often produce spelling errors in 
QuickBooks — it displays the Check Spelling on Form dialog box, shown in 
Figure 1-12. (In Figure 1-12, I’ve misspelled the word Yellow, much to the horror 
of my editor.)
FIGURE 1-12:  
The Check 
­Spelling on Form 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      161
You can use the Change To box to correct your spelling error — if it actually is a 
spelling error. You can select one of the suggested replacements from the 
Suggestions list box by clicking the suggestion and then clicking the Replace 
button. You can replace all occurrences of the misspelling by clicking the 
Replace All button. If the word that QuickBooks says is misspelled is actually 
correctly spelled, you can click the Ignore button to tell QuickBooks to ignore 
this word or the Ignore All button to tell QuickBooks to ignore all occurrences 
of this word in the invoice form.
If you use terms that are always popping up as misspelled words, at least in 
QuickBooks, you can click the Add button that appears on the Check Spelling 
on Form dialog box. Clicking the Add button tells QuickBooks to add the word 
to its spelling dictionary. After you’ve added a word to the QuickBooks spelling 
dictionary, QuickBooks doesn’t see the word as misspelled.
Also note that you can click the Options button to display the Spelling Options 
dialog box. The Spelling Options dialog box includes check boxes that you can 
use to turn certain types of spell-checking logic on or off. You can select a check 
box to tell QuickBooks to always check the spelling of forms before printing, 
saving, or sending the form, for example. The Spelling Options dialog box also 
includes check boxes to tell QuickBooks that it should ignore certain sorts of 
words, such as those that use numbers, those that are all uppercase, and 
those that are mixed case.
7.	 Click either the Save & Close button or the Save & New button to save 
your invoice.
Click the Save & Close button if you want to save the invoice and close the 
Create Invoices window. Click the Save & New button if you want to save the 
invoice and then enter another invoice in the blank version of the Create 
Invoices window.
Click the Send/Ship tab (shown near the top-left corner of Figure 1-10 earlier in 
this chapter) and then click the FedEx, UPS, or USPS button to start the 
QuickBooks Shipping Manager window, which lets you automate some of the 
steps in shipping packages using Federal Express (FedEx), United Parcel Service 
(UPS), or the US Postal Service (USPS). The first time you start the Shipping 
Manager, you need to do a bit of setup work.
To page through invoices that you’ve already created, click the Previous and 
Next buttons. Or click the Find button and use the Find Invoices dialog box to 
describe the invoice that you want to locate.

162      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
QuickBooks lets you add historical information about a customer to — and remove 
that information from — the Create Invoices window, the Create Credit Memos/
Refunds window, and most other customer information windows. To add histori-
cal information about a customer to a window, click the Show History button that 
appears in the top-right corner of the window a bit to the right of the Template 
drop-down lists; it looks like an arrowhead. You can click links in the historical 
information panel to drill down and get more information about, for example, a 
listed transaction.
Billing for Time
Most of the time, line items that appear in an invoice are items that you describe 
in the Item list and then quantify directly in the invoice. In some service busi-
nesses, however, you may actually sell many units of the same item. A lawyer may 
sell hours or partial hours of legal advice and that may be all that she sells. A CPA 
may sell hours of consulting, accounting, or tax preparation work.
In these circumstances, you don’t want to have an invoice go out to the customer 
with one line in it that says, for example, “Legal services, 100 hours, $20,000” — 
unless you don’t want to stay in business. Instead, you want an invoice that details 
each of the tasks that the lawyer performed: estate planning for 1.5 hours, review 
of a contract for 4 hours, preparation of a new real estate lease for 2 hours, and so 
forth. To provide this level of detail — detail that is really beneath the item — you 
use the QuickBooks Time Tracking feature.
QuickBooks supplies two methods for tracking the time spent that will be billed 
in an invoice as an item. You can use the weekly time sheet, or you can time or 
record individual activities. I briefly describe how both time tracking methods 
work; neither is difficult. Professional service providers  — accountants, attor-
neys, consultants, architects, and so on — who bill based on the time spent should 
consider using one of these features to make sure that they keep accurate records 
of the time spent working for a client or customer.
Using a weekly time sheet
To use the weekly time-sheet method, choose the Customers ➪   Enter Time ➪   Use 
Weekly Timesheet command. QuickBooks displays the Weekly Timesheet window, 
shown in Figure 1-13. To use the Weekly Timesheet window, first use the Name 
box to identify the employee, vendor, or other person performing the service. You 
should be able to select this person’s name from the Name drop-down list. If you 
can’t select a person’s name from the Name drop-down list, enter the person’s 

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      163
name in the box; then, when prompted, tell QuickBooks to which list (employee, 
vendor, or other names) it should be added. After you’ve added the name of the 
person performing the work, use the columns of the Weekly Timesheet window 
to describe the customer or job for which the work has been performed, the ser-
vice code, a brief description or note, the payroll item (if you’re using QuickBooks 
for payroll), the class (if you’re tracking classes), and then the hours spent per 
day. You can enter as many lines in the Weekly Timesheet window as you want. 
Each line appears separately in an invoice. The notes information appears in the 
description area of the invoice. For this reason, you want to use appropriate and 
descriptive notes.
Timing single activities
If you want to record service activities as they occur, choose the Customers ➪   Enter 
Time ➪   Time/Enter Single Activity command. QuickBooks displays the Time/Enter 
Single Activity dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-14.
To time or record a single activity, record the activity date in the Date box. Use the 
Name box to identify the person performing the service. In the Customer:Job box, 
identify the customer or the job for which the service is being performed. Select 
the appropriate service item from the Service Item drop-down list and (if you’re 
FIGURE 1-13:  
The Weekly 
Timesheet 
window.

164      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
tracking an employee) the appropriate payroll item from the Payroll Item drop-
down list. If you’re tracking classes, predictably, you can also use the Class drop-
down list to classify the activity. Use the Notes box to record a brief, appropriate 
description of the service. This description appears in the invoice, so be thoughtful 
about what you write.
After describing or providing this general information about the service, you have 
two ways to record the time spent on the service:
»
» Record time manually. You can manually record the time spent on an 
activity by using the Duration box to enter the time. If you spent 10 minutes, 
for example, enter 0:10 in the Duration box. If you spent 3 hours and 40 
minutes, enter 3:40 in the Duration box.
»
» Have QuickBooks record the time. You can also have QuickBooks record 
the time that you spent on the activity. Just click the Start button in the 
Duration box when you start the activity, and click the Stop button when you 
stop the activity. If you want to pause the timer (while you take a phone call, 
for example), click the Pause button.
FIGURE 1-14:  
The Time/Enter 
Single Activity 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      165
After you use the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box to describe the activity 
that you’re performing, click the Save & New or Save & Close button to save the 
activity information.
Verify that the Billable check box (in the top-right corner of the Time/Enter Single 
Activity dialog box) is selected. By selecting the Billable box, you tell QuickBooks 
that it should keep this record of a billable activity for later inclusion in an invoice.
You can use the Previous and Next buttons, which appear at the top of the Time/
Enter Single Activity dialog box, to page back and forth through your records of 
activity timing. Note, too, that a Spelling button is available. Click that button to 
spell-check the notes description that you enter — which is a good idea, because 
this information will appear in an invoice later.
Including billable time on an invoice
To add billable time and cost to an invoice, create the invoice in the usual way, as I 
describe previously. After you identify the customer (if you’ve entered time for the 
customer), and if you’ve been tracking costs for the customer, QuickBooks dis-
plays a message box asking whether you want to bill for any of the time or costs. If 
you indicate “yes,” QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog 
box, shown in Figure 1-15.
The Time tab of this dialog box shows each of the times that you’ve recorded for 
a customer. To add these times to the invoice, click the Use column for the time. 
(The Use column is the leftmost column, displaying a check mark.) Or, if you want 
to select all the times, click the Select All button. Then click OK. QuickBooks adds 
FIGURE 1-15:  
The Choose 
­Billable Time and 
Costs dialog box.

166      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
each of these billable times to the invoice as separate lines. Figure 1-16 shows how 
billable time information appears in the Create Invoices window. You may also 
notice the PAID 7/29/2017 notation on the left side of this figure. Your invoices 
are stamped with the paid date when you receive funds and make deposits cor-
rectly in the program, which I cover later in this chapter.
If you leave the Print Selected Time and Costs As One Invoice Item check box 
unselected (refer to Figure 1-15), QuickBooks puts each time recording you log 
on a separate line of the invoice, as shown in Figure 1-16. If you check the box, 
however, QuickBooks lets you combine individual time recordings into a single 
invoice line item. (You might want to experiment with this feature a bit if you’re 
interested.)
As Figure 1-15 suggests, you can click the Items, Expenses, or Mileage tab to see 
lists of the items, out-of-pocket expenses, or business miles incurred on behalf 
of a customer. You add charges to an invoice for these sorts of things in the same 
way that you add charges for time. You can even apply a markup to your out- 
of-pocket expenses. In Book 2, Chapter 3, I talk about how to record reimbursed 
expenses (out-of-pocket expenses that you want to charge to customers). And 
you can record and then bill for miles you incur on behalf of customers by choos-
ing the Company ➪   Enter Vehicle Mileage command. (When you choose the Enter 
Vehicle Mileage command, use the dialog box QuickBooks displays to log the 
miles covered and identify the customer.) By the way, if you want to return to the 
FIGURE 1-16:  
The ­Create 
Invoices

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      167
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box, and you’re viewing the Create Invoices 
window, click the Add Time/Costs button, which appears at the top of the Create 
Invoices window.
Printing Invoices
You can print invoices and then mail the printed invoices in a couple of ways:
»
» You can print individual invoices by clicking the Print button at the top of the 
Create Invoices window.
»
» You can also print a batch of invoices by clicking the arrow button below the 
Print button, choosing Batch from the menu that QuickBooks displays, and 
then using the Select Invoices to Print dialog box (which QuickBooks displays) 
to select the To Be Printed Invoices for printing. After you select the invoices 
that you want to print by clicking them, click OK.
The menu that QuickBooks displays when you click the Print button includes a 
Preview command. You can choose the Preview command to see a preview version 
of the printed invoice.
Emailing Invoices
You can email an invoice from QuickBooks. To do this, click the Email button, 
which appears at the top of the Create Invoice screen on the Main tab. When 
QuickBooks displays the Send Invoice dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-17, indi-
cate which email account you want to use (web mail, an email application such 
as Microsoft Outlook, or the QuickBooks emailing system), and provide the email 
address and (optionally) a new email message. Then, not coincidentally, click the 
Send button to send the invoice.
The first time you click the Email button, QuickBooks may ask you to describe 
your email account or accounts, which you do by following the onscreen prompts. 
QuickBooks may also suggest that you use its mailing service, which means you 
email the invoice to Intuit and then Intuit snail-mails the paper invoice to your 
client. If you’re interested in Intuit’s invoice mailing service, follow the onscreen 
prompts.

168      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Much to the consternation of many users, recent versions of the QuickBooks 
program added a message and clickable link to the bottom of your printed and 
emailed invoices that prompted those users’ customers or clients to use a free (for 
them) online payment system to pay your invoice. This service, called the Intuit 
Payment Network, costs you a few dollars a month and a 2 to 3 percent service 
charge for credit card payments. For more information, see the last section of this 
chapter “Using Odds and Ends on the Customers Menu.”
Recording Sales Receipts
To bill a customer, you create an invoice, as I describe earlier in this chapter. To 
record the fact that you sold the customer some item — presumably because the 
customer simultaneously purchases and pays for the item or service — you don’t 
invoice the customer. Rather, you create a sales receipt. A sales receipt looks very, 
very similar to an invoice. It doesn’t include shipping information, however (because 
that’s irrelevant), and it lets you record the amount that the customer pays.
To record a sales receipt when appropriate, choose the Customers ➪   Enter Sales 
Receipts command and then follow these steps:
FIGURE 1-17:  
The Send Invoice 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      169
1.	 In the Enter Sales Receipts window, shown in Figure 1-18, use the 
Customer:Job box to describe the customer or, optionally, the customer 
and job.
2.	 Use the Class drop-down list to identify the class if you’re performing 
class tracking.
If you have questions about how the Customer:Job or Class box works, refer to 
“Invoicing a Customer” earlier in this chapter.
You can customize a sales receipt in the same basic way that you customize an 
invoice form. Go back to “Customizing an Invoice Form” at the beginning of this 
chapter.
3.	 Provide the sales receipt header info.
A sales receipt, like an invoice, includes some header information. Specifically, 
the sales receipt includes a sales receipt date and a sales number. The sales 
receipt also includes a Sold To box, which shows the customer name and 
address. You should confirm that this information is correct — as it should be if 
you’re recording timely sales receipts and have an up-to-date customer list.
4.	 Use the Item column to describe the items that you’re selling.
The Item column of a sales receipt works exactly the same way as the Item 
column of an invoice. Therefore, rather than repeat myself, I’ll direct you to go 
back to the earlier discussion of how this column works.
FIGURE 1-18:  
The Enter Sales 
Receipts window.

170      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
5.	 (Optional) If you want, enter a customer message in the footer area of 
the Enter Sales Receipts window.
This option is available directly above the Memo and Customer Tax Code fields. 
If you’ve added other footer information to the Enter Sales Receipts window — 
because you’ve customized the sales receipt form template — you can include 
that information, too.
6.	 Describe where the sales proceeds go.
In the bottom-left corner, the Enter Sales Receipts window may show a Deposit 
To drop-down list. Use this drop-down list to indicate what to do with the 
money that you receive from this sale. If you immediately deposit the amount 
in a bank account, select the account into which you want to deposit the check. 
If you want to batch this receipt with a bunch of other receipts — maybe you’re 
going to deposit the day’s receipts together in one lump sum — select Group 
with Other Undeposited Funds.
If you don’t see the Deposit To drop-down list, you may have indicated 
(perhaps even inadvertently) during setup that you want QuickBooks to 
assume that funds are deposited in an undeposited funds account. This 
probably works just fine. If you do want to specify an account where sales 
proceeds go when you record the sales receipt, choose the Edit ➪   Preferences 
command, click the Payments icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and 
then deselect Use Undeposited Funds As a Default Deposit To Account.
Book 3, Chapter 4 talks about making deposits of undeposited funds.
7.	 (Optional) To print a copy of the receipt, click the Print button.
When you’ve printed the receipt, you can hand it to your customer.
The Previous, Next, Find, Spelling, Show/Hide History, and Time/Cost buttons in 
the Enter Sales Receipts window work identically to the same buttons in the 
Create Invoices window.
8.	 Click the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the sales receipt.
These buttons work the same way in the Enter Sales Receipts window as they 
do in the Create Invoices window.
Both the Create Invoices window (described earlier in the chapter) and the 
Enter Sales Receipts window (just described) include a Print Later check box in 
the toolbar on the Main tab. If you select this check box, QuickBooks adds the 
invoice or sales receipt to its list of unprinted invoices or sales receipts. You can 
print invoices and sales receipts that appear on either side of these lists by 
choosing the File ➪   Print Forms command and then choosing either the 
Invoices or Sales Receipt command. There’s also an Email Later check box that 
you can select if you want to email a receipt later. (See the earlier section 
“Emailing Invoices.”)

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      171
Recording Credit Memos
Credit memos show when a customer no longer owes you money or when you owe 
a customer money. Credit memos may occur because your customer returns items 
that you previously sold to him or her. Credit memos may also occur because you 
issue a customer a refund for some other good reason; perhaps the product wasn’t 
of the quality that you usually sell or a service wasn’t provided in the manner in 
which it should have been.
To record a credit memo, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Customers ➪   Create Credit Memos/Refunds command to 
display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.
2.	 Identify the customer, or the customer and the job, in the Customer: Job 
box, shown in Figure 1-19.
Use the Class box for class tracking if you’ve decided to do that. If you have 
questions about how either of these boxes works, refer to the earlier discus-
sions of these two boxes. These boxes work the same way for credit memos as 
they do for invoices.
FIGURE 1-19:  
The Create Credit 
Memos/Refunds 
window.

172      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
The Create Credit Memos/Refunds window supplies a bunch of buttons on the 
various tabs that work the same way here as they do in the Create Invoices 
window: Previous, Next, and so on. For information about how to use these 
buttons if you have questions, refer to the earlier section on this topic.
As is the case with invoices, you can create custom credit memo forms. To do 
this, you click the Formatting tab’s Customize Data Layout button. Customizing 
a credit memo works the same way as customizing an invoice form. Refer to 
the earlier section on this topic if you have questions about how to customize a 
credit memo.
3.	 Provide the credit memo date and number, and confirm customer 
information.
Credit memos, like invoices and sales receipts, include a header. This header 
includes the transaction date, number, and the customer information. You 
should confirm that the credit memo header information is correct in the 
Create Credit Memos/Refunds window. If it isn’t, edit the default information 
that QuickBooks uses to fill the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.
4.	 In the columns area, describe the reason for the credit memo.
If the customer returned items, for example, use the columns to describe 
these items and the original price that you’re refunding.
5.	 Click the Print button to print the credit memo.
Note, too, that you can print credit memos in a batch. Obviously, after you 
print credit memos, you need to distribute them.
You can email a copy of the credit memo directly from QuickBooks, too. The 
steps for emailing a credit memo mirror those for emailing an invoice, which is 
described earlier in “Emailing Invoices.”
6.	 Click either Save & Close or Save & New to save the credit memo.
At the time you save your credit memo, QuickBooks allows you to indicate 
what you want to do with it: retain it for later application to a customer invoice, 
immediately apply it to a customer invoice, or issue a refund check. You apply 
credit memos to invoices as described in the next section of this chapter. You 
write a refund check the same way that you write other checks. Book 3, 
Chapter 4 describes writing checks.
Receiving Customer Payments
When a customer pays an invoice that you’ve sent, you choose a command from 
the Customers menu to record the payment. To record a customer payment,  
follow these steps:

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      173
1.	 Choose the Customers  ➪   Receive Payments command.
QuickBooks displays the Customer Payment window, shown in Figure 1-20.
2.	 Use the Received From box to identify the customer who’s paying you.
3.	 Record the payment information in the Date, Amount, and Reference # 
on the left side under where it says Customer Payment. You can also 
choose a payment method by clicking cash, check, or credit card to the 
right of these fields.
4.	 Identify the invoice or invoices paid.
QuickBooks lists the open invoices for the customer in the columns area of the 
Receive Payments window. You can identify which invoices a customer 
payment pays by clicking the invoices that you see listed.
5.	 To apply any credit memos to open invoices as you apply the payment, 
follow these steps:
a.	 Click the Discounts and Credits button.
QuickBooks displays the Discount and Credits dialog box, shown in 
Figure 1-21.
FIGURE 1-20:  
The Customer 
Payment 
window.

174      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
b.	 To apply a credit to the selected invoices, click the Credits tab and then select the 
credit that you want to apply.
c.	 Apply any discounts to the open invoices, and click Done.
Discounts work like credits. In fact, you use the same dialog box (refer to 
Figure 1-21). When you click Done, QuickBooks closes the Discount and 
Credits dialog box.
6.	 Use the Deposit To box to select the account to which you want to 
deposit the check, or select the Undeposited Funds option if you want to 
batch the payments for later deposit.
The Deposit To drop-down list appears in the Receive Payments window when, 
during the QuickBooks Setup interview, you indicate that you may want to 
bunch the payments that you later deposit.
If you have a question about how these buttons work, refer to the discussion 
of these buttons in “Recording Sales Receipts” earlier in this chapter.
Click the Get Online Pmts button to receive online payment information for a 
customer. (The Get Online Pmts button appears only if you’re using online 
billing or online banking.) Book 3, Chapter 4 provides more information about 
how online banking works.

7.	 Click the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the customer

Assessing Finance Charges
You can tell QuickBooks to assess finance charges on overdue customer invoices. 
To do this, you first set up the finance charge calculation rules. After you’ve done 
this, you can easily assess finance charges on overdue amounts by choosing the 
QuickBooks command.
Setting up finance charge rules
To set up the finance charge rules, choose the Edit ➪   Preferences command. When 
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Finance Charge icon and 
then click the Company Preferences tab. The Preferences dialog box at this point 
should look like the one shown in Figure 1-22.
To tell QuickBooks how it should calculate the finance charges, enter the annual 
interest rate that you’ll use for calculating charges in the Annual Interest Rate (%) 
box. Enter the minimum finance charge amount that you assess in the Minimum 
Finance Charge box. If you want to create a grace period, enter the number of 
grace-period days in the Grace Period (Days) box. Use the Finance Charge Account 
drop-down list to specify the QuickBooks income account to which finance charge 
FIGURE 1-22:  
The Company 
Preferences tab 
of the Finance 
Charge section of 
the Preferences 
dialog box.

176      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
revenue should be credited. Select the Assess Finance Charges on Overdue Finance 
Charges check box if you want to charge finance charges on finance charges. 
Finally, use the Calculate Charges From radio buttons — Due Date and Invoice/
Billed Date — to specify the date from which finance charges should be calculated. 
After you’ve provided this information, you can click OK to save your finance 
charge calculation rules.
QuickBooks assumes that you don’t want to print finance charge invoices. For 
this reason, the Mark Finance Charge Invoices “To Be Printed” check box isn’t 
selected. Finance charges typically appear only in customer statements.
Calculating finance charges
After you set up the finance charge rules, you can easily assess finance charges on 
overdue invoices. To do this, choose Customers  ➪   Assess Finance Charges. Quick-
Books displays the Assess Finance Charges dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-23. 
This dialog box lists all the overdue invoices that customers owe you and, based on 
your finance charge calculation rules, calculates a finance charge.
To assess the finance charge to a particular customer, click the Assess field for 
the customer. (By default, QuickBooks assumes that you want to assess finance 
charges whenever a customer’s account is past due.) If you don’t want to assess 
finance charges to a particular customer, remove the check mark from the Assess 
field by clicking it. After you’ve identified which customers should be assessed 
finance charges, click the Assess Charges button. QuickBooks essentially creates a 
new invoice for each of these customers. These new invoices charge the customers 
a finance fee.
FIGURE 1-23:  
The Assess 
Finance Charges 
dialog box.

Invoicing Customers
CHAPTER 1  Invoicing Customers      177
Using Odds and Ends on  
the Customers Menu
In this chapter, I discuss most of the important commands on the Customers menu. 
This menu, however, supplies several other commands that are ­noteworthy — 
perhaps even useful — and deserve discussion somewhere in this book. For this 
reason, I want to briefly describe the other commands that may be available on 
your Customers menu:
»
» Customer Center: Displays the Customer Center window, which includes 
information about your customer list, including the amounts that your 
customers owe.
»
» Create Estimates: Displays a window you can use to create an estimate for a 
customer to show, for example, what a product or service will cost if you sell it 
to that customer.
»
» Create Sales Orders: Displays a window you can use to create a sales order. 
Essentially, a sales order is an invoice for something you haven’t yet really sold 
or for services you haven’t yet provided. You prepare a sales order to record 
an order from a customer or client and document the order details.
»
» Sales Order Fulfillment Worksheet: Displays the Sales Order Fulfillment 
worksheet window, which lists all your unfulfilled sales orders. You can print 
batches of sales orders by using this worksheet, too. (Note: If you’ve created 
sales orders for a particular customer or client, QuickBooks asks whether you 
want to turn a sales order into an invoice whenever you start working on an 
invoice for that customer.)
»
» Create Batch Invoices: Displays the Batch Invoice dialog box, which lets you 
identify a group of customers you want to bill for some specified item. After 
you’ve grouped, or batched, the customers in this manner, you can tell 
QuickBooks to create a bunch (a batch) of invoices. If you charge customers a 
monthly retainer fee, for example, you could batch the customers on retainer 
and then create an invoice for each of them that billed for the “monthly 
retainer fee” item.
»
» Enter Statement Charges: Displays the Accounts Receivable Register. You 
shouldn’t need to use this command. You can use this command, however, to 
add amounts to the accounts receivable for a particular customer. The 
amounts appear in the customer’s next statement.
»
» Create Statements: Displays a window that you can use to create a set of 
monthly statements for customers. Such statements show the amounts that a 
customer owes, invoices created for the month, credit memos issued for the 
month, and payments made during the month.

178      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
»
» Income Tracker: Displays the Income Tracker window, which graphically 
organizes your estimates, orders, and invoices to show the flow of sales 
revenue you’ll (ideally) receive and also graphically organizes your vendor bills 
and payments data to show you the flow of expenses you have or will 
experience.
»
» Lead Center: Displays the Lead Center window, which lets you store and 
monitor customer leads. The window lets you name names, collect notes, and 
keep a to-do list of lead-generation activities.
»
» Add Credit Card Processing: Displays a web page that explains and tries to 
talk you into buying Intuit’s credit card processing service.
»
» Add Electronic Check: Displays a web page that explains and tries to talk you 
into buying Intuit’s electronic check service. With an electronic check, or 
e-check, you take payment information from a customer over the phone and 
then use that information to electronically withdraw money from the custom-
er’s bank account.
»
» Link Payment Services to Company File: Makes the connection between 
your QuickBooks data file and the Intuit servers — something that’s necessary 
if you sign up for credit card or electronic check processing.
»
» Intuit Payment Network: Makes the connection between your QuickBooks 
data file and the Intuit servers so you can download any payments people 
have made using the Intuit Payment Network service.
»
» Add Marketing and Customer Tools: Available in the Enterprise Solutions 
version of QuickBooks, this command displays a list of web pages you can 
jump to in order to get information about a work order management feature 
and an electronic data interchange feature that work with QuickBooks.
»
» Learn about Point of Sale: Displays a web page that explains and tries to talk 
you into buying Intuit’s point-of-sale software.
»
» Item List: Displays the Item list, which shows the items that may be included 
in the invoice or credit memo.
»
» Change Item Prices: Lets you change the prices of a bunch of items at one 
time — increasing every price by 5 percent, for example.
»
» Advanced Pricing Rules: Displays a web page with information about an 
add-on price customization feature you can use with the Enterprise Solutions 
version of QuickBooks.

CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      179
Paying Vendors
Y
ou can make the process of tracking vendor information as simple or as 
sophisticated as you like. In this chapter, I assume that you’re going for 
sophisticated. You can make vendor management simpler, however, by not 
using purchase orders or an accounts payable system.
You decide whether to use purchase orders and whether to track accounts pay-
able (amounts that you owe vendors) as part of setting up QuickBooks. You can 
change your decision about using purchase orders or accounts payable later. To do 
this, you choose the Edit ➪  Preferences command. For more information, refer to 
Book 2, Chapter 3.
Creating a Purchase Order
A purchase order serves a simple purpose: It tells a vendor that you want to pur-
chase some item. In fact, a purchase order is a contract to purchase.
Many small businesses don’t use purchase orders. But when they grow to a cer-
tain size, many businesses decide to use them because purchase orders become 
permanent records of items that they’ve ordered. What’s more, using purchase 
orders often formalizes the purchasing process in a company. You may decide, for 
example, that nobody in your firm can purchase anything that costs more than

$100 unless he or she gets a purchase order. If only you can issue purchase orders, 
you’ve effectively controlled purchasing activities through this procedure.
Creating a real purchase order
To use QuickBooks to create purchase orders, follow these steps:
1.	 Tell QuickBooks that you want to create a purchase order by choosing 
Vendors ➪  Create Purchase Orders.
QuickBooks displays the window shown in Figure 2-1.
If the Vendors menu doesn’t supply a Create Purchase Orders command, 
QuickBooks doesn’t know that you want to create purchase orders. Follow the 
instructions described in Book 2, Chapter 3 to turn on the purchase order 
feature.
2.	 Use the Vendor drop-down list to identify the vendor from which you 
want to purchase the item.
The Vendor drop-down list lists each of the vendors in your vendor list.

Purchase Orders 
window.

CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      181
3.	 (Optional) Classify the purchase, using the Class drop-down list.
For more information about how you can use classes, read Book 4, Chapter 4. 
Note that you don’t see a Class drop-down list unless you’ve turned on class 
tracking.
4.	 (Optional) Choose a different Ship To address from the Ship To drop-down 
list in the top-right corner.
The Ship To drop-down list displays a list of all your customers, vendors, and 
employees. You change the Ship To address by selecting one of these other 
names. After you select an entry from the Ship To list, QuickBooks fills in the 
Ship To address box with the appropriate information.
The Create Purchase Orders window’s Main, Formatting, and Reports tabs 
supply some standard and, I hope, familiar buttons and boxes: Previous, Next, 
New, and so on. Because I spend quite a bit of time talking about these buttons 
and boxes in Book 3, Chapter 1, I don’t provide a redundant discussion of these 
buttons and boxes here. If you have questions about what the Previous and 
Next buttons do, refer to Book 3, Chapter 1.
5.	 Confirm the purchase order date.
Initially, QuickBooks puts the current system date in the Date box. You should, 
however, confirm that the date that QuickBooks enters as the purchase order 
date is correct. This is the contract date. Often, the date sets contractual terms, 
such as the number of days within which the item is to be shipped.
6.	 Confirm the purchase order number.
The purchase order number, or P.O. number, uniquely identifies the purchase 
order document. QuickBooks sequentially numbers purchase orders for you 
and places the appropriate number in the P.O. No. box. The guess that 
QuickBooks makes about the right purchase order number is usually correct. If 
it isn’t correct, you can enter a replacement number.
7.	 Confirm the vendor and Ship To information.
The Vendor block and the Ship To block identify the vendor from which you’re 
purchasing the item and the address to which you want the vendor to send the 
shipment. This information should be correct if your vendor list is up to date 
and you’ve correctly used the Ship To drop-down list to identify, if necessary, 
an alternative Ship To address. Nevertheless, confirm that the information 
shown in these two address blocks is correct. If the information isn’t correct, of 
course, fix it. You can edit address-block information by selecting the incorrect 
information and then retyping whatever should be shown.

182      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
8.	 Describe each item that you want to order.
You use the columns of the Create Purchase Orders window to describe in 
detail each item that you want to order as part of the purchase. Each item goes 
in its own row. To describe an item that you want to purchase from the vendor, 
you provide the following bits of information:
•	 Item: The Item column is where you record the unique item number for the 
item that you want to buy. Remember that items need to be entered, or 
described, in the Item list. Book 2, Chapter 2 discusses briefly how you go 
about setting up the Item list. Book 3, Chapter 3 talks in more detail about 
the Item list. The main thing to know about the Item list is that anything 
that you want to show in the invoice — or, for that matter, in a purchase 
order — must be described in the item file.
•	 Description: In the Description column, you describe the item that you 
select. You can also edit the Description field so that it makes sense to 
customers or vendors.
•	 Qty: The Qty column specifies the quantity of the item that you want. 
Obviously, you enter the number of items that you want in this column.
•	 Rate: The Rate column specifies the price per unit or rate per unit for the 
item. Note that QuickBooks uses different labels for this column depend-
ing on the type of business that you’ve set up.
•	 Customer: The Customer column identifies the customer for which the item 
is being purchased.
•	 Class: In the Class column, you classify purchase order items at the item 
level rather than at the purchase order level. Note that you won’t see this 
column unless you’ve turned on class tracking.
•	 Amount: The Amount column shows the total expended for the item. 
QuickBooks calculates the amount for you by multiplying the quantity by 
the rate (or price). You can edit the column amount. In this case, 
QuickBooks adjusts the rate (or price) so that quantity times rate always 
equals the amount.
You enter a description of each item that should be included in the purchase 
order. This means, for example, that if you want to order six items from a 
vendor, your purchase order should include six lines of information.
9.	 Print the purchase order.
The purpose of recording a purchase order in QuickBooks is to create a formal 
record of a purchase. You almost always want to transmit this purchase order 
to the vendor. The purchase order tells the vendor exactly what you want to 
purchase and the price that you’re willing to pay. To print the purchase order, 
you can click the Print button. You can also print purchase orders in a batch 

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      183
later if you select the Print Later check box (available on the Main tab) when 
you’re creating purchase orders, save all the purchase orders that you want to 
print later, and then choose the File ➪  Print Forms ➪  Purchase Orders command.
10.	Save the purchase order.
To save your purchase order, click either the Save & Close button or the Save & 
New button. If you click the Save & New button, QuickBooks saves that 
purchase order and redisplays an empty version of the Create Purchase 
Orders window so that you can record another purchase order.
Using some purchase order tips and tricks
Even though the preceding section details all you need to know to create a pur-
chase order, I want to make a few more important observations:
»
» Not every purchase deserves a purchase order. If you’re not used to 
working with purchase orders, it’s easy to go overboard when you start using 
this handy tool. Nevertheless, keep in mind that not all purchases warrant 
purchase orders (see the next item).
»
» Use purchase orders to manage buying. Typically, businesses use purchase 
orders as a way to control and document purchases. In fact, many purchases 
don’t really require a purchase order. Amounts that you’ve agreed to purchase 
that are documented through standard contracts — such as bills from the 
telephone company, the gas company, and your landlord — don’t need 
purchase orders, obviously. In addition, modest purchases, such as office 
supplies, often don’t need purchase orders. You definitely need a way to 
control these expenditures, but purchase orders probably aren’t the way to go.
»
» Consider other, complementary control tools. Other budgetary controls, 
such as “approval from the supervisor” or a simple budget, often work just 
as well.
Recording the Receipt of Items
When you receive items from a vendor, you can record the receipt. You typically 
do this when you want to record the receipt of an item even before you receive a 
bill for the item. In any business with inventory, for example, you want to know 
exactly how much inventory you have in your warehouse or on your store floor. 
You don’t want to wait to adjust your inventory records for these purchases until 
you receive the invoice from the vendor. In this scenario, you record when you 
receive items.

184      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
To record item receipts, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Vendors ➪  Receive Items command.
QuickBooks displays the Create Item Receipts window, as shown in Figure 2-2.
2.	 Select the vendor from which you’re receiving items from the Vendor 
drop-down list.
3.	 Select any purchase orders that you’re receiving items from.
If open purchase orders exist for the vendor, QuickBooks displays a message 
box, asking whether you want to receive items against one of the open 
purchase orders. If the items that you receive are items that you set up in a 
purchase order, click Yes. When QuickBooks displays the Open Purchase 
Orders dialog box — the dialog box lists only open purchase orders — select 
the one that ordered the items you’re now receiving and then click 
OK. QuickBooks fills out the Items tab of the Create Item Receipts window by 
using the information from the purchase order. This automatic data entry of 
purchase order information should save you time if the items that you’re 
receiving match items in the purchase order.
FIGURE 2-2:  
The Create Item 
Receipts window.

CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      185
4.	Confirm the receipt date.
Use the Date field to confirm the date of receipt. As with the Date field in other 
places in QuickBooks, enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format. Or click the 
Calendar button that appears to the right of the Date field and choose the date 
from the pop-up calendar that QuickBooks displays.
5.	Use the Total box to identify the total value of the order received, if 
available.
QuickBooks calculates this total for you by adding the individual item costs, so 
you can wait until later.
6.	(Optional) Enter a reference number.
You can use the Ref. No. field to provide a reference number. For example, you 
may want to reference the vendor’s order number.
7.	(Optional) Provide a description in the Memo text box.
8.	Describe the items received.
Use the Items tab to identify the items that you’ve received. The Items tab of 
the Create Item Receipts window resembles and works like the Items tab of the 
Create Purchase Order window, as described (briefly) earlier in the chapter and 
(in some detail) in the preceding chapter. For this reason, I don’t discuss how 
you enter, for example, item codes in the Item column. If you have questions 
about how the Items tab works, refer to one of the other appropriate chapters 
in this book.
9.	Describe any related expenses.
The Expenses tab of the Create Item Receipts window works like the Expenses 
tab of the Write Checks window. If you have questions about how the 
Expenses tab works, see the discussion of writing checks in Book 3, Chapter 4.
10.	Click either the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the receipt item.
If you click the Save & Close button, QuickBooks saves your item receipt 
information and closes the Create Item Receipts window. If you click the Save & 
New button, QuickBooks saves the item receipt information and redisplays a 
fresh, clean, cleared version of the Create Item Receipts window. Then you can 
use the window to describe the receipts of some other set of items.
That’s about all you need to know to work with the Create Item Receipts win-
dow. Nevertheless, let me quickly describe the half-dozen command buttons that 
I don’t reference in the earlier discussions:
»
» Select PO: This toolbar button displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, 
which lists the purchase orders open for the selected vendor. By selecting a 

186      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
listed purchase order, you tell QuickBooks to fill out the Items tab with the 
information from that purchase order or orders.
»
» Receive All/Clear Qtys: When it’s labeled Receive All, this command button 
says you’ve received all the items you ordered in some purchase order; when 
it’s labeled Clear Qtys, the button clears the received quantities shown on the 
Items tab if you’ve specified a purchase order. When you click this button, it 
changes from Receive All to Clear Qtys to Receive All, and so on.
»
» Show PO: This command button shows the selected purchase order.
»
» Clear Splits: This toolbar button erases any expense or item information that 
you’ve entered on the Expenses or Items tab and moves the total to the 
Expenses tab.
»
» Recalculate: This toolbar button recalculates the total amount by using the 
information that you’ve entered on the Expenses and Items tabs.
»
» Clear: This button (which appears in the bottom-right corner of the window) 
clears all the information that you’ve entered in the Create Item Receipts 
window, including Expenses-tab information, Items-tab information, and the 
vendor information shown at the top of the window. In effect, the Clear 
button lets you start over.
»
» Enter Time: This toolbar button opens the Select Time Period dialog box, 
shown in Figure 2-3, which you use to specify the date range of the work for 
which you’re paying.
Simultaneously Recording the  
Receipt and the Bill
You can record a bill for items that you receive at the same time that you record 
the receipt of the items. You can do this simply by selecting the Bill Received 
check box that appears near the top of the Create Item Receipts window (refer to 
Figure 2-2).
If you know that you’re going to record a bill at the same time that you record the 
receipt of items, you can also choose the Vendors ➪  Receive Items and Enter Bill 
FIGURE 2-3:  
The Select Time 
Period dialog box.

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      187
command. In other words, rather than choose the Receive Items command from the 
Vendors menu, you choose the Receive Items and Enter Bill command. When you do 
this, QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window, shown in Figure 2-4. Essentially, 
the Enter Bills window is just another version of the Create Item Receipts window 
except that the Bill Received check box is already selected. To simultaneously record 
items that you’ve received and enter a bill, you follow the same steps as you do to 
record the receipt of the items.
One item worth noting about simultaneously recording bills and the receipt of 
items, however, is this: When you enter a bill, you need to be very precise about 
the charges of the vendor. In all probability, you won’t pay just for the ordered 
items, for example; you may also pay certain shipping and handling fees. These 
amounts won’t necessarily get recorded on the Items tab. They’ll probably be 
recorded on the Expenses tab.
Entering a Bill
If you told QuickBooks during the setup process that you want to track unpaid 
bills, also known as accounts payable, you can enter bills as you receive them. As 
you do this, QuickBooks keeps track of the unpaid bills.
FIGURE 2-4:  
The Enter Bills 
window.

188      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Good, accurate record keeping of unpaid bills, or accounts payable, is essential if 
you want to do good accrual-basis accounting. As I discuss in Book 1, Chapter 1, 
accrual-basis accounting produces more accurate financial statements than other 
methods do.
To enter a bill, you follow either of two sequences of steps.
If you haven’t previously recorded  
an item receipt
If you’re entering a bill for which you haven’t previously recorded an item receipt, 
you follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Vendors ➪  Enter Bills command.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window, shown in Figure 2-5. You use this 
window to describe the bills that you later need to pay.
2.	 Use the Vendor drop-down list to identify the vendor.
3.	 Use the Date, Amount Due, and Bill Due fields to describe the invoice 
date, the invoice due date, and the invoice amount.
FIGURE 2-5:  
The Enter Bills 
window. Again.

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      189
4.	 (Optional) Use the Terms drop-down list to identify the payment terms 
and the Ref. No. box to identify the vendor’s reference number.
5.	 (Optional) If you want to, enter a memo description for the bill in the 
Memo box.
6.	 Identify the expenses billed.
Use the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window to identify the expenses that 
the bill represents. To identify expenses, you supply the account number that 
should be debited; the amount; and (optionally) the Memo, Customer:Job, and 
Class information. If you have questions about how the Expenses tab works, 
see the discussion of writing checks in Book 3, Chapter 4. The Expenses tab of 
the Write Checks window works the same way as the Expenses tab of the Enter 
Bills window.
7.	 Identify the items billed on the Items tab.
Use the Items tab of the Enter Bills window to describe any items for which the 
vendor bills you. Use the Item column to identify the thing that you purchased, 
for example; then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount columns to identify what the 
item cost. You can also use the Customer:Job column if you’re tracking bills by 
customers. If you have questions about how to work with the Items tab, be 
aware that the Items tab of the Enter Bills window works the same way that 
the Items tabs of other QuickBooks windows work. You can, for example, refer 
to the discussion of the Create Invoices window in Book 3, Chapter 1.
The buttons available in the Enter Bills window — Select PO, Receive All, Show 
PO, Clear Splits, Recalculate, and Clear — work the same way as the similarly 
titled command buttons scattered around the edges of the Create Item 
Receipts window, discussed in “Recording the Receipt of Items” earlier in this 
chapter.
8.	 Click either the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the bill.
If you have previously recorded  
an item receipt
To enter a bill when you’ve already recorded the receipt of the item for which the 
bill invoices, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Vendors ➪  Enter Bill for Received Items command.
QuickBooks displays the Select Item Receipt dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6.

190      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
2.	 To identify the item receipt for which you’re now recording a bill, select 
the vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.
3.	 When QuickBooks displays a list of item receipts for the vendor, select 
the item receipt that corresponds to your bill, and click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Bills window for the item. QuickBooks fills out 
much of the Enter Bills window by using the information from the item receipt, 
as shown in Figure 2-7.
You may be able to skip Steps 4–8 if your item receipt information correctly 
and completely fills the Enter Bills window.

Item Receipt 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      191
4.	 Use the Date, Amount Due, and Bill Due fields to describe the invoice 
date, the invoice due date, and the invoice amount.
5.	 (Optional) Use the Terms drop-down list to identify the payment terms 
and the Ref. No. box to identify the vendor’s reference number.
6.	 (Optional) If you want to, enter a memo description for the bill in the 
Memo box.
7.	 Use the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window to identify the expenses 
that the bill represents.
To identify expenses, you supply the account number that should be debited, 
the amount, and (optionally) the Memo, Customer:Job, and Class information. 
If you have questions about how the Expenses tab works, see the discussion of 
writing checks in Book 3, Chapter 4. The Expenses tab of the Write Checks 
window works the same way as the Expenses tab of the Enter Bills window.
8.	 Use the Items tab of the Enter Bills window to describe any items for 
which the vendor bills you.
Use the Item column to identify the thing that you purchased, for example; 
then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount columns to identify what the item cost. 
You can also use the Customer:Job column if you’re tracking bills by customers. 
If you have questions about how to work with the Items tab, be aware that the 
Items tab of the Enter Bills window works the same way that Items tabs of 
other QuickBooks windows work. You can, for example, refer to the discussion 
of the Create Invoices window in Book 3, Chapter 1.
9.	 Click either the Save & Close or Save & New button to save the bill and 
item receipt information.
You record credit memos from vendors by using the Enter Bills window, too. 
The only difference in recording a credit memo is that you select the Credit radio 
button.
Paying Bills
If you use QuickBooks to keep track of the bills that you owe, you don’t use the 
Write Checks window (described in Book 3, Chapter 4) to record the bills that you 
want to pay. Rather, you tell QuickBooks to display a list of these unpaid bills that 
you’ve already recorded — and then you choose which bills QuickBooks should 
pay and the bank account on which QuickBooks should write the check.

192      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Follow these steps to pay bills in this manner:
1.	 Choose the Vendors ➪  Pay Bills command.
QuickBooks displays the Pay Bills window, shown in Figure 2-8. You use the Pay 
Bills window to describe the payment that you want to make.
2.	 Describe which bills you want to pay.
Use the Show Bills radio buttons at the top of the Pay Bills window to identify 
what you want to see. Select the Due On or Before radio button to show only 
those bills that are due on or before the specified date. To specify the date, 
enter the date in the Due On or Before box. To see a list of all the bills that you 
have to pay, select the Show All Bills radio button.
You can use the Sort By drop-down list to select the order that QuickBooks 
uses for listing your bills. You can sort bills by due date, discount date, vendor, 
and amount due.
3.	 Select the bills that you want to pay.
To select bills that you want to pay, click the check column. (The check column 
is the leftmost column in the list of unpaid bills; it’s headed by a check mark.) 
When you click the check column, QuickBooks marks the bill with a check mark. 
FIGURE 2-8:  
The Pay Bills 
window.

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      193
The check mark tells QuickBooks that you want to pay that bill. To deselect a 
bill, click the check column again. QuickBooks removes the check mark.
4.	 (Optional) Review a specific bill.
You can review detailed information about a specific bill by first clicking the bill 
to highlight it in the list and then clicking the Go to Bill button. When you do 
this, QuickBooks opens the Enter Bills window, displaying the bill information. 
To close the Enter Bills window, click the Close button.
5.	 Set the discount and credit, and then click Done.
If you click the Set Discount button, QuickBooks displays the Discount tab of 
the Discount and Credits dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-9. You can use the 
Discount tab to enter a discount amount for the bill. If you enter a discount 
amount for the bill, you also enter the discount account. This is the account 
that gets credited for the reduction — the discount — in the correct amount.
If you click the Pay Bills window’s Set Credits button, QuickBooks displays the 
Credits tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box, shown in Figure 2-10. The 
Credits tab lists any credit memos from this vendor. To apply a credit memo to 
the amount due to a vendor, click the Set Credits button. QuickBooks marks 
applied credits by placing a check mark in the marked column.
When you complete your work with the Discount and Credits dialog box, click 
the Done button to close the dialog box and return to the Pay Bills window.
Click the Clear button in the Discount and Credits dialog box to clear the 
applied credits shown on the Credits tab.
FIGURE 2-9:  
The Discount tab 
of the Discount 
and Credits  
dialog box.

194      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
6.	Use the Payment Account drop-down list in the bottom-right corner to 
select the bank account to be used for making payments.
You can double-check to make sure you have enough money in the bank 
account because the ending balance is displayed in the account you have 
selected after you complete this payment (refer to Figure 2-8).
7.	Use the Method drop-down list in the Payment section to select the 
payment method.
If you want to pay your bills by check, for example, select Check. Assuming that 
you’ll print the checks in QuickBooks, select the To Be Printed radio button; 
otherwise, select the Assign Check Number radio button to have QuickBooks 
assign the next consecutive check number. You can also pay bills by other 
methods, such as by credit card and by online payment (if you’re set up for 
online payment or online banking).
8.	Use the Date box in the Payment section to record the payment date.
This entry interacts with the entry in Step 7. The payment date that you set, for 
example, affects when an online payment gets made. The payment date also 
corresponds to the date that’s shown on printed checks.
9.	After you select the bills that you want to pay and describe how you want 
to pay them, click Pay Selected Bills.
QuickBooks records the payment transactions in the bank account to pay the 
selected bills and closes the Pay Bills window.
10.	Complete your task.
You still need to print any unprinted checks necessary to pay bills if you’re 
using checks to pay the bills. You also need to transmit any online payment 
instructions necessary to pay the bills, if that’s how you’ve chosen to pay the 
bills. If you’re going to handwrite checks, you obviously need to handwrite the 
FIGURE 2-10:  
The Credits tab of 
the Discount and 
Credits dialog 
box.

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      195
checks and then mail them. In other words, all QuickBooks does at this point is 
record the payment transactions in the QuickBooks data file. You need to print 
the checks, send the online payment instructions, or handwrite the checks!
Reviewing the Other Vendor Menu 
Commands
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I talk about the most important 
­commands on the Vendor menu. Nevertheless, before I wrap up this little dog-and- 
pony show, I quickly review for you the other commands and what they do.
Vendor Center
The Vendor Center window, shown in Figure 2-11, displays a list of vendors and 
detailed vendor information for the selected vendor. To use it, select from the Active 
Vendors drop-down list the vendor for which you want to see detailed information. 
The Vendor Center shows a bunch of information for a vendor. All this information 
comes from the Vendor list, by the way, which is discussed in Book 2, Chapter 2.
FIGURE 2-11:  
The Vendor 
­Center window.

196      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
If you keep records of your vendors, including information such as their tele-
phone numbers, just about the best place to store that information, in my humble 
opinion, is the Vendor list. You have to maintain the Vendor list for QuickBooks 
to work. Why not also go to a little bit of extra effort and keep all your vendor 
information there? If you adopt this approach, the Vendor Center window is the 
window that you can use to quickly look up things such as the vendor’s phone or 
fax number.
Sales Tax menu commands
The Sales Tax command displays a submenu of commands that pay sales tax 
amounts you’ve collected to the appropriate tax agency; adjust the sales tax lia-
bility due; and produce reports on the sales tax liability you owe, the sales tax 
revenue you’ve generated, and the sales tax codes you’ve set up.
Note: To see this menu, you need to tell QuickBooks that you collect sales tax. 
You may tell QuickBooks that you collect sales tax during the QuickBooks setup 
process. You can also use the Edit ➪  Preference command’s Sales Tax preference 
settings for the company.
To pay the sales taxes you owe, simply choose the Vendors ➪  Sales Tax ➪  Pay Sales 
Tax command. When QuickBooks displays the Pay Sales Tax dialog box (which 
lists the amounts you owe various sales tax collection agencies), you select the 
agencies you want to pay or click the Pay All Tax button. QuickBooks records 
checks in the bank account register (see Book 3, Chapter 4 for details about how to 
work with the bank register), and you print the checks in the usual way.
To adjust the amount that QuickBooks thinks you owe a sales tax collection 
agency, you can choose the Vendors ➪  Sales Tax ➪  Adjust Sales Tax Due command. 
When QuickBooks displays the Sales Tax Adjustment dialog box, select a sales tax 
agency in the Sales Tax Vendor box and an appropriate expense or income account 
in the Adjustment Account box. Next, you select the appropriate button (Increase 
Sales Tax By or Decrease Sales Tax By) and enter the adjustment amount in the 
Amount box.
To print one of the sales tax reports, simply select the command that corresponds 
with the report. To print the Sales Tax Liability report, for example, choose the 
Vendors ➪  Sales Tax ➪  Sales Tax Liability command.
The Manage Sales Tax command displays a window with buttons and clickable 
hyperlinks that you can use to get sales tax information and perform some of the 
tasks described in the preceding paragraphs.

Paying Vendors
CHAPTER 2  Paying Vendors      197
Inventory Activities menu commands
The Inventory Activities command displays a submenu of commands that you use 
to work with QuickBooks inventory features and with the related Item list. I’m 
not going to discuss this stuff here — not because I’m lazy, but because I discuss 
inventory and the Item list in Book 3, Chapter 3.
Print/E-file 1099s
The Print/E-file 1099s command displays a submenu of commands that let you 
print 1099-MISC forms for a selected calendar year. You can see the vendors for 
which you probably need to print 1099s, for example, by choosing the Print/E-file 
1099s ➪  Review 1099 Vendors command. (When you choose this command, Quick-
Books displays the Vendor 1099 Review report, which lists vendors and indicates 
the vendors that are, per your descriptions, eligible for a 1099.)
The reporting threshold may change in the future due to inflation, but the general 
rule is that if you operate a business or own rental property, you need to send a 
1099-MISC to pretty much any unincorporated vendor you pay $600 or more dur-
ing the year for services. And before you decide not to follow this rule, you should 
know two other facts.
»
» Your business tax return actually needs to disclose whether you followed this 
rule. Yikes.
»
» If you don’t send 1099s, you’ll pay a penalty from $30 to $100 per late 1099 if 
you’re merely late (with a maximum penalty total set to $500,000). If you 
simply blow off this requirement, the penalty equals $250 per 1099 — with no 
maximum penalty.
You can use the Print/E-file 1099s ➪  1099 Wizard command to start an online wiz-
ard that helps you identify the vendors that require 1099s and then prepare to 
print or e-file those 1099s.
Finally, you can choose the Print/E-file 1099s menu’s 1099 Summary Report and 
1099 Detail Report commands to produce reports you can use to identify which 
vendors need 1099s and what detailed information goes in those 1099s.
For information about how to set 1099 preferences, refer to Book 2, Chapter 3.
Item List
The Vendors ➪  Item List command displays the Item List window. You can read 
more about the Item List window in Book 3, Chapter 3.

Tracking Inventory 
and Items
I
f you’ve worked with QuickBooks, you won’t be surprised to hear that the Item 
list is a key piece of your QuickBooks accounting system. The Item list identifies 
each of the things that you sell. The Item list also identifies other things that 
appear in your invoices and — if you use them — purchase orders.
In this chapter, I talk about how you work with the QuickBooks Item list — more 
specifically, how you look at and use the information in the Item list to track and 
tally what you sell. I explain how to add information to the list and how to edit 
information that’s already in the list. What’s more, I talk about three accounting 
tasks that are related to your Item list: adjusting physical inventory accounts for 
inventory shrinkage or spoilage, adjusting price levels of your inventory items, 
and (if you manufacture inventory) using QuickBooks to handle inventories of 
manufactured goods.

Looking at Your Item List
QuickBooks provides a bunch of ways to see the information that you’ve stored 
in your Item list. You may already know some of this stuff if you’ve worked with 
QuickBooks a bit; some of it may be new to you. In any case, the next sections 
review the nearly half-dozen ways that you can see the items in your Item list.
Using the Item Code column
One important point to consider as you look at the Item Code column and Item 
Code drop-down list in the Create Invoices window (see Figure 3-1) is space. Note 
that the Item Code column is pretty narrow. Note also that the Item Code drop-
down list in Figure 3-1 provides the item code (the left column), the item type, 
and a more lengthy item description. Though you do have quite a bit of space for 
a description, you can’t go hog wild.
I’m using self-explanatory item codes in this reference, as you can see in ­Figure 3-1. 
In real life, your codes may be far more cryptic.

column and drop-
down list in the

CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      201
Using the Item List window
If you choose the Lists ➪ Item List command, QuickBooks displays the Item List 
window, as shown in Figure 3-2. The Item List window identifies the item code or 
name, the description, the type of item (I talk more about this in the next section 
of the chapter), the account that gets credited when you sell some of the items, 
and the inventory stocking and pricing information (if you supply that).
The Item list provides a good way to quickly see what items you can put in invoices 
and purchase orders. The Item list also provides a quick and convenient way to see 
stocking levels and prices.
If you want more information about an item shown in the Item List window, you 
can double-click the item. When you double-click the item, QuickBooks displays 
the Edit Item window, as shown in Figure 3-3. Essentially, the Edit Item win-
dow displays all the information available about a particular item. You can use 
this window to change bits of item information. Later in this chapter, in “Editing 
Items,” I describe how to do this.
FIGURE 3-2:  
The Item List 
window.

202      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Using inventory reports
I mention one other thing because it’s so darn useful. As you’d expect, Quick-
Books supplies several interesting, useful inventory reports. If you choose the 
Reports ➪ Inventory command, for example, QuickBooks displays a submenu of 
inventory reports. The submenu provides reports that give inventory valuations, 
inventory stock levels, and a worksheet that you can use to physically count the 
inventory on store shelves or in the warehouse.
Book 4, Chapter 2 describes how you produce reports in QuickBooks and how you 
customize those reports. If you want to find out more about reports and report 
customization, see that chapter.
Adding Items to the Item List
You can add a bunch of types of items to the Item list. Remember that as noted in 
the early paragraphs of this chapter, the Item list stores descriptions of anything 
that you stick in an invoice or purchase order.
When you think about this for a minute, you realize that you have different types 
of items. If you’re a retailer, for example, the inventory that you sell may appear 
FIGURE 3-3:  
The Edit Item 
window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      203
in an invoice. If you provide discounts to different sorts of customers, discounts 
may appear in an invoice as a line item. If you’re in a state that taxes sales, sales 
tax appears as a line item in an invoice.
You describe different items in different ways. You describe an inventory item that 
may appear in an invoice differently from the way you describe a sales tax that 
you’re required to charge.
Given this disparity, I first describe the general process for adding an item to the 
Item list. After you know the big-picture stuff, I talk about the items that appear 
in the Item list individually. Sound okay? I’ll get started.
Adding an item: Basic steps
To add an item to your Item list, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Lists ➪ Item List command.
QuickBooks displays the Item List window (an example of which appears in 
Figure 3-2, earlier in this chapter).
2.	 To display the Item menu, click the Item button, which appears in the 
bottom-left corner of the Item List window.
QuickBooks displays the Item menu.
3.	 Choose the New command.
This command tells QuickBooks to display the New Item window, as shown in 
Figure 3-4.
FIGURE 3-4:  
The New Item 
window.

204      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
4.	 Use the boxes of the New Item window to describe the item that you 
want to add.
Your first step is to identify the type of item that you want to add. Based on the 
type of item, QuickBooks supplies other boxes that you use to describe the 
item. (I go into more detail about this in the following paragraphs, so don’t get 
freaked out — yet.)
5.	 Save the item.
After you use the boxes in the New Item window to describe the item that you 
want to add, click OK. QuickBooks adds the item that you just described in the 
Item list.
The step-by-step approach described in the preceding paragraphs is the conven-
tional way to add an item, but you can also add items on the fly. If you’re using the 
Create Invoices window or the Create Purchase Orders window, you can open the 
Item drop-down list and choose Add New Entry. When you do this, QuickBooks 
displays the New Item window (refer to Figure 3-4). Then you use the New Item 
window to add the item in the manner discussed here.
Adding a service item
You use service items to purchase or bill for items that represent service. Take 
my example. I’m a CPA in Redmond, Washington. One of the things that I do is 
prepare tax returns for individuals and businesses. When I bill a client for prepar-
ing his or her tax return, the line item that appears in the invoice for Tax Return 
Preparation is a service item.
In your business, you probably have service items, too. A health-care provider, 
such as a dentist or doctor, provides treatment or performs procedures. Dentists 
might fill cavities. Doctors might perform physicals or give vaccinations. These 
activities represent services.
Even retailers and contractors — businesses that you typically think of as selling 
tangible physical goods — often sell services. A retailer may gift-wrap a purchase, 
which is a service. A contractor may provide services such as painting and cleanup.
To add a service item, display the New Item window (refer to Figure 3-4, earlier 
in this chapter), and choose Service from the Type drop-down list. In the Item 
Name/Number box, give the service a brief code or name. If the service is a 
­subitem, select the Subitem Of check box and identify the parent item.
Select the check box titled This Service Is Used in Assemblies or Is Performed by 
a Subcontractor or Partner if the service is provided by (as the window suggests) 

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      205
a subcontractor, owner, or partner. You indicate which services are performed by 
subcontractors, owners, and partners because these parties are subject to differ-
ent tax accounting rules.
Next, use the Description box to describe the service. Your description appears 
in invoices and purchase orders, so you want to be thoughtful here. Use the Rate 
box to describe the price or rate per unit of service. Use the Tax Code drop-down 
list to indicate whether the service is taxable. Finally, use the Account drop-down 
list to identify which income account should be credited when the item is sold to 
some customer, client, or patient.
Adding an inventory part
Inventory parts are those items in invoices and purchase orders that represent 
physical goods that you buy, hold, and sell. If you’re a retailer, all that stuff that’s 
sitting out on the shelves of your store represents inventory. If you’re a manu-
facturer, the raw materials that you buy and then use to assemble your products 
represent inventory.
To set up an inventory part, display the New Item window and choose Inventory 
Part from the Type drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Inventory Part ver-
sion of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
FIGURE 3-5:  
The Inventory 
Part version of 
the New Item 
window.

206      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Use the Item Name/Number box to provide a descriptive but brief code or name 
for the item. If the item is a subitem of some other parent item, select the Subitem 
Of check box and then identify the parent item by using the Subitem Of text box.
The Purchase Information and Sales Information boxes let you determine the 
information that appears in purchase orders and invoices. The Description on 
Purchase Transactions box in the Purchase Information area, for example, lets 
you provide the text that QuickBooks displays in purchase orders. You can also 
guess at the purchase cost by using the Cost text box. Specify the cost of goods 
sold (COGS) account that should be debited when this item is sold by choosing 
it from the COGS Account drop-down list, and identify the preferred vendor for 
purchases of this item by choosing that vendor from the Preferred Vendor drop-
down list.
The Sales Information boxes provide the information that QuickBooks needs to 
correctly include the item in an invoice. The Description on Sales Transactions box 
provides a space that you can use to supply the description that QuickBooks should 
use for this item on your invoice. The Sales Price box enables you to provide your 
price for the item. If you’re subject to sales tax, you see (and should use!) the Tax 
Code drop-down list to specify whether the item is taxable or nontaxable for sales 
tax purposes. Finally, the Income Account drop-down list lets you specify which 
income account should be credited when this item is sold.
If you’re confused about seeing three Account drop-down lists in the Inventory 
Part version of the New Item window, keep in mind that when you sell an item, 
you track the income by crediting an income account and the cost of goods sold by 
debiting the cost of goods sold account.
Use the Inventory Information boxes to describe how QuickBooks should handle 
inventory tracking for the item. Use the Asset Account drop-down list, for exam-
ple, to specify which account QuickBooks should use to track the dollar invest-
ment in this item. Typically, you use the Inventory Asset account, but you can 
conceivably use some other asset account. Use the Reorder Point boxes to identify 
the inventory stocking level at which you want QuickBooks to alert you to reorder 
the item. If you have inventory on hand for this item, enter the quantity that you 
have on hand and the value that you have on hand in the On Hand and Total Value 
boxes. You also specify the date as of which your quantity and value information 
is correct by using the As Of box.
You really shouldn’t be entering inventory balances for an inventory item when 
you set it up in the Item list. You should be entering or changing inventory quanti-
ties and values when you purchase the inventory (recorded in the Create Purchase 
Orders window or the Write Checks window) and when you sell the inventory 
(typically recorded in the Create Invoices window or the Sales Receipts window). 

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      207
If you enter a quantity other than zero or a total value other than zero in the New 
Item window, you also need to make a journal entry to record the other half of 
the transaction. If this “other half” business sounds complicated, just trust me: 
You shouldn’t be entering quantity or value information in this window. If you do 
understand this “other half” business that I’m referring to, you should know bet-
ter than to enter quantity or value information in the New Item window!
You can click the Spelling button to check the spelling of words and phrases that 
you’ve entered in the New Item window. You can also click the Next button to 
save the information that you’ve entered for an item and redisplay the New Item 
window so you can add another item.
Adding a noninventory part
To add a noninventory part  — which is a tangible good that you sell but for 
which you don’t track inventory  — display the New Item window and choose 
Non-Inventory Part from the Type drop-down list. When QuickBooks displays 
the Non-Inventory Part version of the New Item window (see Figure 3-6), give 
the noninventory part a name or code by using the Item Name/Number box. If 
the new item is a subitem, select the Subitem Of check box and then identify the 
parent item by using the Subitem Of text box. Use the Description box to provide 
the description that should go in invoices that bill for this noninventory part. 
Obviously, you enter the price in the Price box. Use the Tax Code drop-down list 
to identify whether the item is subject to sales tax. Finally, use the Account drop-
down list to identify the income account that should be credited for sales of this 
noninventory part.
FIGURE 3-6:  
The regular 
Non-Inventory 
Part version of 
the New Item 
window.

208      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Note the check box labeled This Item Is Used in Assemblies or Is Purchased for a 
Specific Customer:Job. If you select that check box, QuickBooks displays a slightly 
different version of the Non-Inventory Part window, as shown in Figure 3-7. This 
version of the window includes Purchase Information and Sales Information areas 
that work the same way as the Purchase Information and Sales Information areas 
supplied by the regular Inventory Part version of the New Item window. (Refer to 
Figure 3-5 and the discussion of Figure 3-5 earlier in the chapter.)
Adding an other-charge item
An other-charge item is an item that you use to purchase or bill for things such as 
miscellaneous labor or services; materials that you aren’t tracking as inventory; 
and special charges, such as for delivery or setup or rush jobs.
To set up an other-charge item, display the New Item window and choose Other 
Charge from the Type drop-down list. When you do, QuickBooks displays the 
Other Charge version of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-8. To finish 
setting up your other charge item, give the charge a name or code or abbreviation 
by using the Item Name/Number box. If the other charge item is a subitem, select 
the Subitem Of check box and then identify the parent item by using the Subitem 
Of text box. Obviously, you use the Description box to provide a description of 
the charge. (Remember that this description appears in your invoices.) Use the 
Amount or % box to identify how the charge gets calculated or billed. Use the Tax 
Code drop-down list to identify the charge as subject to sales tax — or not subject 
to sales tax. Use the Account drop-down list to identify the income account that 
should be credited when you bill for this other charge.

Non-Inventory

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      209
If you select the check box titled This Item Is Used in Assemblies or Is a Reim-
bursable Charge, QuickBooks adds a second set of boxes to the New Item window. 
One set of boxes, labeled Purchase Information, provides information that goes in 
purchase orders or is used to record purchases and purchase orders. The other set 
of boxes, labeled Sales Information, goes in invoices and sales receipts to record 
the actual sale or billing for the other charge.
If you want to enter an other charge that should be calculated as a percentage, you 
must enter the % symbol in the Amount or % box. To include an other-charge 
item in invoices that equals 25 percent of the previous item in the invoice, for 
example, enter 25% in the Amount or % box.
Adding a subtotal item
If your purchase order, sales receipt, or invoice includes a subtotal line item, you 
create a subtotal item in your Item list. To do this, display the New Item window 
and choose Subtotal from the drop-down list. Next, give the subtotal item a name 
or abbreviation, and use the Description box to describe the subtotal. Finally, 
check the column or columns you want QuickBooks to subtotal. (Usually, you want 
just the amount column to be totaled, but you can also have the quantity, price, 
and cost columns totaled, too.) Figure 3-9 shows the Subtotal version of the New 
Item window.
If you’re using other charge items that are calculated as a percentage or ­discount 
items that are calculated as a percentage, you almost certainly need a subto-
tal item. An other charge that is calculated as a percentage typically would be 
­calculated as a percentage of a subtotal item. Similarly, a discount item that’s 
calculated as a percentage is calculated as a percentage of a subtotal item.

Charge version

­window.

210      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Adding a group item
A group item lets you more easily invoice customers when, from the customer’s 
perspective, he or she is buying a single item, but from your perspective, you’re 
actually selling several items. This definition sounds curious at first, but let me give 
you a quick example. Suppose that you’re a florist who does booming business on 
Valentine’s Day. Your best-selling items may be red roses and pretty crystal vases. 
But you probably don’t sell individual roses and individual vases. You actually sell a 
dozen roses with a single vase. Although you want to individually track purchases 
of dozens of red roses and individual crystal vases in your purchase orders, in your 
invoices to customers, you want to bill for “a dozen red roses in a crystal vase.”
At the end of the chapter, I describe another item type: inventory assembly, which 
works similarly to the group item type. The inventory assembly item type is for 
manufacturers.
If that example doesn’t make sense, imagine a more complex floral arrangement, 
including a dozen red roses, a crystal vase, baby’s breath, flower preservative, 
­tissue-paper wrapping, ribbon, a box, and so forth. In this case, do you really 
want an invoice that shows perhaps 20 items? Or do you want an invoice that 
shows a single item: a dozen red roses in a crystal vase? This is why you create 
group items. A group item lets you create a single item that you use in invoices, 
but this group item actually combines a bunch of individual items that you’re 
probably using in your purchase orders.
To create a group item, display the New Item window and choose Group from 
the Type drop-down list. When QuickBooks displays the group version of the 
New Item window (see Figure 3-10), use the Group Name/Number box to give 
the group item a name or code. Use the Description box to give the group item an 
appropriate description. Use the Item, Description, and Qty columns at the bottom 
FIGURE 3-9:  
The Subtotal­ 
­version of 
the New Item  
window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      211
of the window to identify the individual items and item quantities that combine 
to make a group.
Adding a discount item
A discount item subtracts either a fixed amount or a percentage from a subtotal. 
To set up a discount item, display the New Item window and choose the Discount 
entry from the Type drop-down list. When you do, QuickBooks displays the Dis-
count version of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-11.
To set up your discount item, enter a name or abbreviation for the discount in 
the Item Name/Number box. If the discount item is a subitem, select the ­Subitem 
Of check box and then identify the parent item by using the Subitem Of text 
box. Typically, you describe the discount by using the Description box. Enter the 
amount of the discount in the Amount or % box as either a dollar amount or as a 
FIGURE 3-10:  
The Group 
version of 
the New Item 
window.
FIGURE 3-11:  
The Discount 
­version of 
the New Item 
window.

212      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
percentage. (If you do enter the discount as a percentage, be sure to include the 
percentage symbol.) Use the Account drop-down list to specify which account 
gets debited for the discount. Finally, use the Tax Code drop-down list to indicate 
whether the discount is applied before sales tax. (In other words, indicate whether 
the discount is subject to sales tax.)
If you set up a discount item that calculates the discount as a percentage, you 
probably also need a subtotal item. Then, in your invoices, follow the subtotal 
item with the discount item. In this manner, you can easily calculate the discount 
percentage by looking at the subtotal amount.
Adding a payment item
If you sometimes accept payments at or before the point you invoice a customer, 
you can create a payment item and then add the payment item to the bottom of 
the invoice. If you do this, the invoice, the payment amount, and the net amount 
due all appear in the same document. That’s pretty cool.
To set up a payment item, display the New Item window and choose Payment from 
the drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Payment version of the New Item win-
dow, shown in Figure 3-12. Use the Item Name/Number box to give the payment item 
a code or name such as “payment.” Use the Description box to provide a nice descrip-
tion of the payment. (No kidding, you may want to include the phrase Thank you as 
part of the payment description, such as Payment . . . thank you!) Use the Payment 
Method drop-down list to identify the method of payment: American Express, check, 
cash, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa, as appropriate. Finally, use the radio buttons — 
Group with Other Undeposited Funds and Deposit To — to identify what happens to 
the money received as part of the payment. If you indicate that the money is depos-
ited, you also choose the correct bank account from the Deposit To drop-down list.
FIGURE 3-12:  
The Payment 
­version of 
the New Item 
window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      213
Adding a sales tax item
If you sell items that are subject to sales tax, you also include line items in your 
invoices that charge for and track these sales taxes. To do this, you create sales tax 
items. To create a sales tax item, display the New Item window and choose Sales 
Tax Item from the Type drop-down list. When you do, QuickBooks displays the 
Sales Tax Item version of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-13. Use the 
Sales Tax Name box to identify or provide an abbreviation for the sales tax. Use 
the Description box to give the sales tax a description. Finally, use the Tax Rate 
(%) box to identify the sales tax rate and the Tax Agency (Vendor That You Collect 
For) drop-down list to identify the tax agency that you’ll pay.
Setting up a sales tax group
In many jurisdictions, although businesses may charge a single sales tax on 
sales, the sales tax actually gets distributed to several tax agencies. A firm may be 
required to charge a 9 percent sales tax, for example, but perhaps 1 percent goes to 
the local city government, another 2 percent goes to the county government, and 
the remaining 6 percent goes to the state government. In this case, you can set up 
a sales tax group, which appears as a single line item invoice. The sales tax group 
is actually made up of individual tax items, however.
To add a sales tax group, display the New Item window and choose Sales Tax Group 
from the Type drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Sales Tax Group version 
of the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-14. Enter a name or an abbre-
viation for the sales tax in the Group Name/Number box. Provide an appropriate 
description in the Description box. Then use the Tax Item column to identify the 
individual tax items that comprise the sales tax group. Note that you should have 
already set up the tax items that you want to add to the sales tax group.

Adding custom fields to items
If you’ve worked much with the New Item window, or if you’ve paid particularly 
close attention to the figures shown in the last few pages of this chapter, you may 
have noticed the Custom Fields command button that appears in many, although 
not all, of the New Item windows (refer to Figure 3-12).
The Custom Fields button enables you to add your own custom fields to the Item 
list. To add a custom field, click this button. When you do, QuickBooks displays a 
message box and then a small dialog box labeled Custom Fields for Unnamed Item.
When QuickBooks displays the Custom Fields for Unnamed Item dialog box, click 
the Define Fields button. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Custom Fields for Items 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-15. To add custom fields for the item, use the Label 
column to name the fields and then check the Use column for each field you want to 
appear. If you want to add a custom field for Insured Value, for example, enter the 
label Insured Value in the first row of the Label column, and check the Use column.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      215
Note: If you’re working with the Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks 
(which is what Figure  3-15 actually shows), QuickBooks provides a What Kind 
of Data? column that you can use to specify the type of information that can be 
entered in the new custom field: text, numbers, and so on. Use the Required on 
Trans and Required on List columns to tell QuickBooks you want to specify the 
items for which the custom field is required. When you select either Required 
column, QuickBooks displays another dialog box that lets you select the types of 
items that need the custom field.
When you click OK, QuickBooks redisplays the Custom Fields for Unnamed Item 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-16. The dialog box now shows the new custom 
field — in this example, Insured Value.
Note that custom fields are available for all items. Also note that you see custom 
fields for items by displaying the item’s information in the New Item window or 
the Edit Item window and then clicking the Custom Fields button.
Editing Items
You can change item information. To do so, display the Item List window and then 
double-click the item. When you do this, QuickBooks displays the Edit Item win-
dow, which resembles the New Item window. The difference is that the Edit Item 
window is already filled in with the item information. To change some bit of item 
information, edit the contents of the field with the information to be updated. 
Click OK to save your changes.

Adjusting Physical Counts and  
Inventory Values
Inventory shrinkage, spoilage, and (unfortunately) theft all combine to reduce 
the inventory that you physically have. To record these inventory reductions, you 
periodically physically count your inventory and then update your QuickBooks 
records with the results of your physical counts.
I don’t spend any time in this book talking about approaches to providing physical 
counts; you probably have better ideas than I do about how to do that. You pre-
sumably know what works best in your business. I can tell you, however, that to 
record your physical count information in QuickBooks, you use a special tool. Spe-
cifically, you use the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand command. This command is 
available to you in two places. If you display the Item list, click the Activities but-
ton (which appears at the bottom of the Item List window) and choose the Adjust 
Quantity/Value on Hand command. You can also choose the Vendors ➪ Inventory 
Activities ➪ Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand command. Choosing either command 
displays the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, shown in Figure 3-17.
FIGURE 3-17:  
The Adjust 
­Quantity/Value 
on Hand window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      217
To use the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, follow these steps:
1.	 Use the Adjustment Type drop-down list to indicate what you’re 
adjusting.
You can adjust the quantity or the value or both the quantity and the value of 
the items you’re holding in inventory. Just choose the appropriate entry from 
the Adjustment Type drop-down list: Quantity, Total Value, or Quantity and 
Total Value.
2.	 Use the Adjustment Date box to record the date of your physical count.
In other words, you want to adjust your quantities as of the day you took or 
completed the physical inventory count.
3.	 Use the Adjustment Account drop-down list to identify the expense 
account that you want to use to track your inventory shrinkage expense.
4.	 (Optional) Provide a reference number (if you use numbers) to uniquely 
and meaningfully identify or cross-reference the transaction.
5.	 (Optional) Identify the Customer:Job and class.
If it’s appropriate (in many cases, it won’t be), use the Customer:Job drop-down 
list to identify the customer and job associated with this inventory shrinkage. In 
a similar fashion, if appropriate, use the Class drop-down list to identify the 
class that you want to use for tracking this inventory shrinkage.
6.	 Supply the correct inventory quantities.
The Item, Description, and Qty on Hand columns of the Adjust Quantity/Value 
on Hand window identify the inventory items that you’re holding and the 
current quantity counts. Use the New Quantity column to provide the correct 
physical count quantity of the item. After you’ve entered the new quantity, 
QuickBooks calculates the quantity difference and shows this value in the Qty 
Difference column.
You can actually enter a value in the New Quantity column or the Qty 
Difference column. QuickBooks calculates the other quantity by using the 
current quantity information that you supply. If you enter the new quantity, 
QuickBooks calculates the quantity difference by subtracting the new quantity 
from the current quantity. If you enter the quantity difference, QuickBooks 
calculates the new quantity by adjusting the current quantity for the quantity 
difference.
7.	 Adjust the value.
If you chose Total Value or Quantity and Total Value from the Adjustment Type 
drop-down list in Step 1, QuickBooks displays an expanded version of the 
Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window, as shown in Figure 3-18. This window 

218      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
lets you enter both the correct physical count quantity and the updated value 
for the inventory item. You enter the physical count quantity, obviously, in the 
New Quantity column. You enter the new updated value in the New Value 
column. You probably use this version of the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand 
window only if you’re using a lower-of-cost or market inventory valuation 
method. Both financial accounting standards and tax accounting rules allow 
you to mark down your inventory to the lower of its original cost or its fair 
market value. If you’re doing this — and how you do this is beyond the scope 
of this book — you enter the new inventory value in the New Value column.
Essentially, using the lower-of-cost or market inventory evaluation method just 
means that you do what it says. You keep your inventory valued at its original 
cost or, if its value is less than its original cost, at its new value. Obviously, 
assessing the value of your inventory is a little tricky. But if you have questions, 
you can ask your CPA for help. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that you 
can’t go changing your accounting methods willy-nilly without permission from 
the Internal Revenue Service. And changing your inventory valuation method 
from cost, say, to lower-of-cost or market is a change in accounting method.
8.	 Provide a memo description.
If you want to further describe the quantity or value adjustment, use the Memo 
box for this purpose. You may want to reference the physical count worksheets, 
FIGURE 3-18:

version of the

Value on Hand 
window.

and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      219
the people performing the physical count, or the documentation that explains 
the valuation adjustment.
9.	 Save the adjustment.
After you’ve used the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window to describe the 
quantity changes or value changes in your inventory, click either the Save & 
Close button or the Save & New button to save the adjustment transaction. As 
you probably know at this point in your life, Save & Close saves the transaction 
and closes the window. Save & New saves the transaction but leaves the 
window open in case you want to make additional changes.
Adjusting Prices and Price Levels
QuickBooks provides a couple of handy commands and tools that you can use to 
change the prices that you charge customers for your products and services. In the 
following sections, I describe both of these handy aids.
Using the Change Item Prices command
The Change Item Prices command, which appears on the Customers menu, dis-
plays the Change Item Prices dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-19. This dialog box 
lets you change prices of a bunch of items at one time by an amount or percentage. 
To use the Change Item Prices dialog box, first select the items whose prices you 
want to change by clicking the check-mark column. Next, use the Adjust Price of 
Marked Items by (Amount or %) box to specify the dollar amount or the percent-
age amount by which you want to change the price. If you want to change the price 
of selected items by $2, for example, enter $2 in the box. If you want to change the 
price of selected items by 5 percent, enter 5% in the box. Use the Based On drop-
down list to indicate the base to which you want to add the amount of percentage. 
After you identify the items that you want to reprice and the way that you want to 
reprice them, click the Adjust button. QuickBooks recalculates the prices and dis-
plays this information in the New Price column. If you want to change the prices 
for the items selected, click OK.
If you don’t like the prices listed in the New Price column, you can just keep tin-
kering with the value in the Adjust Price of Marked Items by (Amount or %) box, 
clicking the Adjust button to refresh the numbers in the New Price column, and 
clicking OK only when you’re satisfied.

220      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Using price levels
Price levels are kind of weird; they let you individually adjust the price of an item 
up or down. If you’ve agreed to discount items by 10 percent for a certain cus-
tomer, for example, you can easily do this by using a price level to knock the price 
down by 10 percent whenever you’re invoicing that customer.
To use price levels, you first have to set up the price levels by using the Price Level 
List command. After you set up your price levels, you adjust prices by using price 
levels when you create an invoice. I describe how both tasks work.
Creating a price level
To create a price level, choose the Lists ➪ Price Level List command. When you do, 
QuickBooks displays the Price Level List window (not shown). To create a price 
level, click the Price Level button and then choose Price Level ➪ New. QuickBooks 
displays the New Price Level window, as shown in Figure 3-20. Name the price 
level change by using the Price Level Name box. Select the items to which you 
want to apply the price level by clicking them. (QuickBooks marks selected items 
with a check.) Then use the Adjust Price of Marked Items to Be boxes to indicate 
that this price level increases or decreases the sales price some percentage higher 
or lower than the standard price. Finally, use the Round Up to Nearest drop-down 
list to specify whether and how QuickBooks should round off its calculations. 
­Figure 3-20, for example, shows a price level change that decreases the sales price 
by 10 percent. If you click the Adjust button, QuickBooks shows the adjusted price 
in the Custom Price column.
FIGURE 3-19:  
The Change Item 
Prices dialog box.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      221
Using a price level
To use a price level, you create an invoice in the usual way. Click the Price Each 
column for the item that you want to reprice by using the price level. When you 
do, QuickBooks turns the Price Each column into a drop-down list. If you click the 
arrow button that opens the drop-down list, QuickBooks displays both the base 
rate price and any price levels. If you choose a price level, QuickBooks adjusts the 
price for the price level change. In Figure 3-21, selecting the 10 percent price level 
change bumps the price from $4.00 to $3.60. In other words, the “Ten Percent 
Decrease” price level change decreases the default price by 10 percent, or 40 cents.
FIGURE 3-20:  
The New Price 
Level window.
FIGURE 3-21:  
Choosing a price 
level with the 
Create Invoices 
window.

222      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
QuickBooks also lets you set a default price level for a customer. When such a 
default price level is set, QuickBooks automatically uses the appropriate price level 
when you choose that customer. The Price Level box appears on the Additional 
Info tabs of the New Customer and Edit Customer windows.
Enabling advanced pricing
One more thing you should know about setting prices. QuickBooks also provides an 
advanced pricing function, which you turn on by choosing the Edit ➪ Preferences 
command, selecting the Sales & Customers preference, clicking the Company Pref-
erences tab, and then selecting the Enable Advanced Pricing button.
When you enable advanced pricing, you convert any price levels you’ve previously 
defined (see preceding paragraphs) to price rules that you can tell QuickBooks to 
apply to items, item types, particular vendors, customers, customer types, and 
job types.
After you turn on advanced pricing, you can choose the Lists ➪ Price Rule List com-
mand to display the Price Rule List window. To convert a price level to a working 
price rule, double-click the new price rule and then use the Edit Price Rule dialog 
box (not shown) to describe the rules QuickBooks should use for automatically 
repricing some item according to your specified rules. This is an Enterprise-only 
feature.
Managing Inventory in a  
Manufacturing Firm
Tracking inventory in a manufacturing firm is more difficult than in other types 
of businesses. When you boil down everything to its essence, the problem stems 
from a couple of tricky accounting requirements:
»
» In a manufacturing environment, the manufacturer combines raw 
materials items into finished-goods items. This means — and this is the 
challenging part — that the manufacturing process reduces the inventory 
count and value for some items (the raw materials or the components) and at 
the same time increases the count and value of the other, finished-
goods items.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      223
» In a manufacturing environment, the rules say that you don’t just count 
the value of items in the finished-goods-item inventory values. You also 
count the cost of labor and factory overhead used in manufacturing the items.
QuickBooks solves the first problem related to manufacturing inventory, but it 
doesn’t solve or address the second problem. Fortunately, as long as you’re a 
small manufacturer, you probably don’t need to worry too much about the second 
problem. You should ask your CPA about this. But don’t worry — Congress and 
the Internal Revenue Service have provided a bunch of loopholes that make the 
accounting easier for the small guys.
Handling manufactured inventory 
the simple way
If you’re using QuickBooks Pro or some earlier versions of QuickBooks Premier, 
you don’t have the ability to account for the manufacture of inventory in Quick-
Books. The best that you can do is group items to combine into individual items in 
a customer’s invoice. This approach sounds sloppy, but it isn’t quite as bad as you 
may think at first blush. You can choose to show only the group item in a customer 
invoice. This means — getting back to the example of the florist selling red roses 
and vases — that the florist can “manufacture” a crystal vase of a dozen red roses 
and then show the manufactured item as a group item in the customer’s invoice.
The one thing that’s problematic about the “just use a group item” approach is 
that it doesn’t give you a way to track the finished goods’ inventory values.
Performing inventory accounting 
in QuickBooks
To account for the manufacture of inventory in QuickBooks Premier or Quick-
Books Enterprise Solutions, you add inventory assembly items to the Item list for 
those items that you manufacture. You also record the manufacture of items as 
you . . . well, manufacture them.
Suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain mostly just buys and resells coffee mugs and 
other porcelain doodads. But also suppose that once a year, Pine Lake Porcelain 
assembles a collection of red coffee mugs into a boxed St. Valentine’s Day gift set. 
In this case, QuickBooks can record the assembly of a boxed gift set that com-
bines, for example, four red coffee mugs, a cardboard box, and some tissue-paper 
wrapping.

224      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Adding inventory assembly items
To describe manufactured items, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Item List.
QuickBooks displays the Item List window.
2.	 Click the Item button in the Item List window, and choose New from the 
drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the New Item window.
3.	 Choose the Inventory Assembly item from the Type drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the Inventory Assembly version of the New Item window, 
as shown in Figure 3-22.
4.	 Specify the account to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell it.
QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve created other 
accounts for your COGS, however, choose the other appropriate account.
FIGURE 3-22:  
The Inventory 
Assembly version 
of the New Item 
window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      225
5.	Describe the manufactured item.
Type a description of the item that you want to appear in documents that your 
customers see, such as invoices. (QuickBooks suggests the same description 
that you used in the Description on Purchase Transactions text box as a 
default.)
6.	Enter the amount that you charge for the item in the Sales Price box.
7.	Indicate whether the manufactured item is subject to sales tax by using 
the Tax Code drop-down list.
8.	Use the Income Account drop-down list to specify the account that you 
want QuickBooks to use for tracking the income from the sale of the 
item.
9.	Identify the components that go into the finished item.
Use the Bill of Materials list to identify the individual component items and the 
quantities needed to make the inventory assembly. Each component item goes 
on a separate line in the list. Not to be too redundant, but do note that you 
identify both the component item and the number of component items 
needed.
10.	Identify the asset account.
Specify the other current asset account that you want QuickBooks to use for 
tracking this inventory item’s value.
11.	Select a build point.
Use the Build Point boxes to specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item 
that can remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory level drops 
to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a reminder to the Reminders list, notifying 
you that you need to make more of the item.
12.	Ignore the On Hand and the Total Value boxes.
See that On Hand box? Leave it set to zero. To enter a number now is to record 
an uncategorized transaction, and you don’t want to do that. Go ahead and 
leave the Total Value field set to zero, too.
13.	Leave the As Of box empty, or enter the current date.
It doesn’t matter.
Recording manufacture or assembly of items
To build some assembly, choose the Vendors ➪ Inventory Activities ➪ Build Assem-
blies command. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window, as shown 
in Figure 3-23. All you do is choose the thing that you want to build from the 

226      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Assembly Item drop-down list and then enter the quantity that you (or some hap-
less co-worker) built in the Quantity to Build box in the bottom-right corner. (In 
Figure 3-23, I’ve created an assembly — Valentines Box — that consists of some 
colorful mugs, an attractive gift box, and some scented tissue paper.) Then you 
click either the Build & Close or Build & New button. (Click the Build & New button 
if you want to record the assembly of some other items.)
While I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the Build 
Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
»
» In the top-right corner of the window, QuickBooks shows the quantity of the 
assembly that you have on hand and the number of customers who have 
placed orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, so remember that 
it’s there.
»
» A table in the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes into your 
product. Not that you care, but this is a bill of materials.
»
» At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the maxi-
mum number of assemblies that you can make, given your current inventory 
holdings.
FIGURE 3-23:  
The Build 
Assemblies 
version of 
the New Item 
window.

Tracking Inventory  
and Items
CHAPTER 3  Tracking Inventory and Items      227
»
» When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts. If you 
make boxed gift sets, each with four red mugs and two wrapping tissues, 
QuickBooks reduces the item counts of red mugs and wrapping tissues, and 
increases the item counts of the boxed gift sets when you record building the 
assembly.
Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory items. You can 
use noninventory parts in an assembly.
Managing multiple inventory locations
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions lets you deal with the record-keeping chal-
lenge of storing inventory in multiple locations. To turn on this capability, called 
Advanced Inventory Tracking, choose the Edit ➪ Preferences command, click Items 
and Inventory, click the Company Preferences tab, and then click the Advanced 
Inventory Settings button. If you’re using the Enterprise Solutions version of 
QuickBooks, QuickBooks displays dialog boxes that allow you to build a list of 
inventory sites, and also adds fields to appropriate windows and dialog boxes so 
you can track inventory items by site. If you’re not using the Enterprise Solu-
tions version of QuickBooks, QuickBooks displays information about how you can 
upgrade to Enterprise Solutions.


CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      229
Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
Q
uickBooks provides several tools that make working with your bank 
accounts easier, such as a special window for recording the checks you’ve 
written. QuickBooks also lets you easily record deposits into accounts. 
Additionally, QuickBooks includes tools for easily recording transfers between 
accounts, for reconciling bank accounts, and for performing online banking 
transactions. This chapter talks about all these features.
If you’ve used QuickBooks’s little-brother product, Quicken, much of the infor-
mation that you see here will be familiar. The QuickBooks banking tools look like 
the popular Quicken checkbook program. (This is good news for the 10 million or 
so Quicken users.)
Writing Checks
Obviously, any business writes checks to pay bills and to pay employees. Quick-
Books includes a command and a window specifically for the purpose of recording 
and possibly printing checks.

Recording and printing a check
To record or print checks, choose the Banking ➪ Write Checks command. When 
QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window, as shown in Figure 4-1, take the 
following steps to write a check:
1.	 Use the Bank Account drop-down list to select the correct account on 
which to write a check.
2.	 Use the No. (check number) field to identify the check number.
If you don’t know the check number yet because you haven’t printed the check, 
leave the No. field blank. Then select the Print Later check box, which appears 
on the Main tab of the Write Checks window.
When you select the Print Later check box, QuickBooks displays the phrase To 
Print in the No. field.
3.	 Use the Date field to record the date that the check is written or will be 
written.
You can enter the check date in mm/dd/yyyy format. You can also enter dates 
as simply mmdd or m/dd, and QuickBooks transforms them to mm/dd/yyyy. 
Thus, 8/12, 0812, and 0812/2017 are all valid ways to enter the same date, if 
the current year is 2017.
FIGURE 4-1:  
The Write Checks 
window.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      231
Alternatively, you can click the small calendar button that appears to the right 
of the Date field. When you click the calendar button, QuickBooks displays a 
pop-up calendar. To select a day shown on the calendar, click the day. The 
pop-up calendar also includes a pair of buttons that you can click to scroll back 
and forth through the months.
4.	 Use the Pay to the Order Of field to identify the individual or business 
that you’re paying with the check.
If the check that you’re recording is the first check that you’ve ever made out to 
the payee, you must type the payee’s name in the Pay to the Order Of field. If 
you’ve previously paid the payee, you can click the arrow button at the right 
end of the Pay to the Order Of field. When you do, QuickBooks displays a list of 
previous payees. You can select a payee from this list by clicking the name.
5.	 Move the selection cursor to the Dollars (or amount) field and type the 
check amount.
QuickBooks writes out the check amount on the line below the Pay to the 
Order Of field.
6.	 (Optional) Provide an address.
If you want, you can use the address block to provide the payee’s address. 
Note that QuickBooks writes the payee name on the first line of the address 
block when you fill in the Pay to the Order Of field. You can add the other lines 
to the address block manually. Note, though, that if you’ve previously entered 
an address for a payee (such as when you last recorded a check to the payee), 
QuickBooks reuses this address information for subsequent checks.
You can edit the address information shown in the Write Checks window.
You need to record the address only if you’re going to print the check and the 
address will show through the address window or when you’re creating an 
online payment — something I talk about later in this chapter.
7.	 (Optional) Provide a memo description.
You can use the Memo field to provide or record additional information. If 
you’re going to print the check, for example, you can use the Memo field to 
identify your account number or the invoice number that the check pays. If 
you’re simply recording checks and won’t be printing checks, you can use the 
Memo field to record more proprietary or confidential information.
8.	 (Optional) Select the Pay Online check box on the Memo tab.
So here’s the deal: If you’ve told your bank that you want to do the online 
banking thing and have followed its instructions for setup, you can select the 
Pay Online check box (which appears after you’ve set up online banking — it 
won’t show up in our figures for our fictitious Pine Lake Porcelain since, not 
surprisingly, no bank would open an actual account for our fake company). 

232      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
This setting tells QuickBooks to transmit this check information to your bank, 
along with instructions to the bank to make the payment.
More information on setting up online banking is available later in this chapter.
To transmit the payment instructions to the bank later, choose Banking ➪ Bank 
Feeds ➪ Bank Feeds Center, click Send, and enter your personal identification 
number (PIN) when QuickBooks asks for it. Note that QuickBooks doesn’t display 
the Bank Feeds command until you set up an account for online banking.
9.	 Distribute the check amount to the appropriate expense or asset accounts.
If the check pays for a particular expense or purchases a particular asset, click 
the Expenses tab. Then use the lines or rows of the Expenses tab to identify 
the account and the amount that the check pays. To record a $50 check that 
pays supplies expense, for example, use the Account column of the Expenses 
tab to select the office-supplies expense account; then use the Amount column 
to identify the amount of the office supplies. Optionally, use the Memo column 
to provide a memo description of that line of expense detail. Equally optionally, 
use the Customer:Job column and the Class column to further describe and 
categorize the line of account detail information. If you categorize the expense 
as one incurred for a particular customer or job, you can use the Billable? 
column to indicate whether this item should be billed to the customer later 
(see Figure 4-2).
FIGURE 4-2:  
The Write Checks 
window, filled 
out to record an 
expense.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      233
If a check pays for several types of expenses, the Expenses tab should show 
several lines.
If you write a check to purchase an asset, the Expenses tab doesn’t show an 
expense account; instead, its tab shows an asset account. If you buy a $5,000 
piece of machinery, you may distribute, or categorize, that $5,000 check to an 
asset account. In this case, the Account column of the Expenses tab shows the 
asset account name and the Amount column shows the amount of the asset 
purchased.
10.	Describe the items that the check purchases.
Figure 4-3 shows the Items tab of the Write Checks window. You use the Items 
tab when you write a check to purchase items shown and described in your Item 
list. If you write a $1,000 check to buy 1,000 $1 items for inventory, you use the 
Items tab. To use the Items tab, identify the item being purchased by entering 
the item code or name in the Item column. Optionally, edit the item description 
shown in the Description column. Then use the Qty, Cost, and Amount columns 
to describe the number of items and the total cost of the items purchased. As 
with the Expenses tab, QuickBooks gives you the option of further classifying an 
item by using the Customer:Job, Billable?, and Class columns.
FIGURE 4-3:  
The Write 
Checks window, 
displaying the 
Items tab.

234      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Book 3, Chapter 3 describes how items and the Item list work in QuickBooks. If 
you’re unsure how to work with items, refer to that chapter.
11.	To print a check, click the Print button.
The Print option is in the top menu above the bank account you’ve selected to 
pay out of. Alternatively, if you want to print checks in a batch, after you’ve 
recorded the very last check that you want to print, click the down arrow below 
the Print button. When QuickBooks displays the Print menu, choose its Print 
Batch command. QuickBooks displays the Select Checks to Print dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 4-4. Select the checks that you want to print by clicking them. 
Use the First Check Number box to identify the number of the first check form 
to use for printing. Then click OK.
When QuickBooks displays the Print Checks dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5, 
use the Check Style area to identify the type of check forms on which you’re 
printing. If you’re using standard or wallet-style checks, you also need to 
indicate the number of checks. Then click the Print button.
FIGURE 4-4:  
The Select 
Checks to Print  
dialog box.
FIGURE 4-5:  
The Print Checks 
dialog box.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      235
You can also print check forms in a batch by choosing the File ➪ Print 
Forms ➪ Checks command. When you choose this command, QuickBooks 
displays the Select Checks to Print dialog box. Identify which checks you want 
to print, click OK, and use the Print Checks dialog box to finish printing your 
checks.
12.	After you describe the check and the reasons for writing the check, click 
either the Save & Close or the Save & New button in the Write Checks 
window.
The Save & Close button saves the check and also closes the Write Checks 
window. Click the Save & New button to save the check and then redisplay the 
Write Checks window so that you can record another check. If you don’t want 
to save the check, click the Clear button.
The Write Checks window provides several buttons on the Main tab: Previous, 
Next, Print, and Find. I describe the Print button in an earlier step, but let me 
note here that the Previous and Next buttons page back and forth to the 
checks that you’ve already written. The Find button displays the Find Checks 
dialog box, which you can use to describe a check similar to the one you’re 
looking for. After you describe the check you’re looking for, click the Find 
button in the Find Checks dialog box.
Customizing the check form
While I’m on the subject of printing check forms, I’ll quickly make a couple of 
observations. If you click the Fonts tab of the Print Checks dialog box, QuickBooks 
displays a couple of buttons you can click to specify what fonts QuickBooks should 
use for printing check forms (see Figure 4-6).
FIGURE 4-6:  
The Fonts tab of 
the Print Checks 
dialog box.

236      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
If you click the Font button, for example, QuickBooks displays the Select Font dia-
log box, shown in Figure 4-7. You select the font you want from the Font list box, 
any special type style (such as bold or italic) from the Font Style list box, and the 
point size from the Size list box. You can experiment with different font settings 
and see the combined effect in the Sample box.
If you click the Partial Page tab, QuickBooks displays the dialog box shown in 
­Figure 4-8. Use this tab’s buttons to tell QuickBooks how you feed a partial page 
of check forms through your printer.
One final tidbit about customizing check forms: If you click the Logo button (avail-
able in the Print Checks dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-8), QuickBooks displays 
a little dialog box that lets you tell QuickBooks it should print a logo on your 
checks. To print a logo, you need an image file for the logo (perhaps something 
FIGURE 4-7:  
The Select Font 
dialog box.
FIGURE 4-8:  
The Partial Page 
tab of the  
Print Checks 
dialog box.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      237
you’ve created in Paint or another image-editing program). This little dialog box 
just lets you tell QuickBooks where the logo image file is located.
Making Bank Deposits
QuickBooks also supplies a command and window for recording bank deposits. To 
record bank deposits, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Banking ➪ Make Deposits command.
QuickBooks displays the Payments to Deposit dialog box, shown in Figure 4-9. 
The dialog box shows any payments previously recorded by means of the 
Receive Payments and Enter Sales Receipts commands, which appear on the 
Customers menu. (Note that QuickBooks goes right to the Make Deposits 
window, shown in Figure 4-10 later in this section, and skips the Payments to 
Deposit dialog box if there are no pending deposits to make.)
2.	 Use the Payments to Deposit dialog box to select the payments you want 
to deposit.
You can select all the payments listed by clicking the Select All button. You can 
select individual payments by clicking them. QuickBooks marks selected 
payments with a check mark.
FIGURE 4-9:  
The Payments to 
Deposit dialog 
box.

238      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
3.	 Click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Make Deposits window, shown in Figure 4-10.
4.	 Use the Deposit To drop-down list to identify the bank account into which 
you’re depositing the funds.
5.	 Use the Date box to identify the deposit date.
You can enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy fashion, or you can click the small 
calendar button to the right of the Date field. On the calendar that appears, 
click the day that you want the Date field to show.
6.	 (Optional) Provide a memo description.
Initially, QuickBooks uses the Memo field to describe the transaction as a 
deposit. This is, obviously, a pretty good description of a deposit transaction. If 
you want to change the memo description to something else even more 
useful — such as daily cash sales or something like that — replace the contents 
of the Memo box.
Perhaps the best use for the box was suggested by the accountant who 
reviewed this manuscript: You can use this field to further describe any 
unusual transactions, such as refunds of expenses, rebates, asset sale 
proceeds, and so forth.

Deposits window.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      239
As you may know either from working with QuickBooks or from the discussion 
of making sales in Book 3, Chapter 1, you have the option of telling QuickBooks 
(whenever you receive a payment) that the payment should be directly 
deposited to the bank account or lumped with other payments in an undepos-
ited funds bucket.
Not all customer payments appear in the Make Deposits window. As discussed 
in Book 3, Chapter 1, you can also indicate that a customer payment should be 
deposited in a bank account directly from two windows: the Receive Payments 
window and the Enter Sales Receipts window. These direct-into-the-account 
payments don’t appear in the Make Payments window. You actually record 
these bank account deposits at the same time that you record the customer 
payment or the sales receipt.
7.	 Record any additional deposit amounts.
If you want to include as part of the deposit some other payment that’s not 
listed initially in the Make Deposits window, you can use the next empty row of 
the list to describe this payment. To describe the payment, use the Received 
From column to identify the customer, vendor, or other individual or business 
making the payment. Use the From Account column to identify the account 
that should be credited for this payment. In the case of a customer payment 
that’s a sale, for example, your sales revenue account should be the one 
recorded in the From Account column. Use the other columns of the Make 
Deposits window — Memo, Chk No., Pmt Meth., Class, and Amount — to 
provide the other details of the payment.
8.	 Identify any cash-back amount.
If you’re making a $1,000 deposit but want to hold $100 of the deposit back as 
cash, you record a cash-back amount. To record a cash-back amount, use the 
Cash Back Goes To drop-down list to identify the account that should be 
adjusted for the cash back. Use the Cash Back Memo field to describe the 
reason for the cash-back transaction. Finally, enter the cash-back amount in 
the cleverly titled Cash Back Amount box. If you want to hold $100 of cash back 
for an owner draw, for example, you may enter owner draws (suppose that 
this is an account) in the Cash Back Goes To box. Then you may use the Cash 
Back Memo field to further describe the reason for the draw. Or not. Finally, 
you enter the cash-back amount, $100, in the Cash Back Amount box.
9.	 Save the deposit transaction.
As is the case with other QuickBooks transaction-entry windows, click either 
the Save & Close or the Save & New button to save your deposit transaction. 
Note that after you’ve saved the deposit transaction, QuickBooks records the 
deposit in the appropriate bank account. This deposit transaction total — 
which appears in the Deposit Total field at the bottom of the window — is the 
amount that appears in your bank statement. It’s also the amount that appears 

240      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
in the bank account register. (I talk about bank account registers a little later in 
the chapter.)
The Make Deposits window also provides Previous and Next buttons that 
enable you to page back and forth through your deposit transactions. The Print 
button in the Make Deposits window lets you print a deposit list. The Payments 
button lets you redisplay the Payments to Deposit dialog box. The History 
button lets you display a transaction history for the selected payment. Finally, 
the Attach button opens a dialog box that you can use to attach a document 
(such as a PDF image of a check) to the deposit.
Transferring Money between Bank 
Accounts
The Banking menu supplies a useful command for transferring money between 
bank accounts. To transfer money between accounts, you can choose the Bank-
ing ➪ Transfer Funds command. When you do so, QuickBooks displays the Trans-
fer Funds Between Accounts dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-11.
To use the Transfer Funds Between Accounts dialog box, follow these steps:
1.	 Use the Date field to identify the transfer date.
You can enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, or you can click the small 
calendar button that appears to the right of the Date field. When QuickBooks 
displays the calendar, click the day that corresponds to the date you want to 
enter in the Date field.
FIGURE 4-11:  
The Transfer 
Funds Between 
Accounts dialog 
box.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      241
2.	 Use the Transfer Funds From drop-down list to select the bank account 
from which you’re moving funds.
You can enter the bank account name in the box, or you can click the drop-
down arrow at the right end of the box and choose a bank account from the 
list that QuickBooks supplies.
3.	 Use the Transfer Funds To drop-down list to identify the bank account 
that receives the transferred funds.
The Transfer Funds To list works like the Transfer Funds From list.
4.	 Use the Transfer Amount box to identify the amount of the transfer.
If you transfer $1,000 from your savings to your checking account, for example, 
the transfer amount is $1,000. (This is what Figure 4-11 shows.)
5.	 (Optional) Provide a memo description for the transfer transaction.
If you want (and this is no big deal), you can use the Memo box to provide 
some brief memo description of the funds transfer.
6.	 Save the transfer transaction.
To save your transfer transaction, click either the Save & Close or the Save & 
New button. Alternatively, if you don’t want to save the transfer transaction, 
click the Clear button.
Working with the Register
You can record checks, deposits, and account transfers by using the commands 
described in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, but you have another method 
available, too: You can use the Register window. The Register window looks like the 
regular paper register that you use to keep track of transactions for a bank account. 
QuickBooks allows you to enter transactions directly into an account register.
Recording register transactions
To enter a bank account transaction directly into an account register, follow these 
steps:
1.	 To display an account register, choose the Banking ➪ Use Register 
command.
Sometimes, when you choose the Banking ➪ Use Register command, QuickBooks 
displays the Use Register dialog box (see Figure 4-12). Sometimes, it displays the 
actual register (see Figure 4-13).

242      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
The Use Register dialog box asks you to select the bank account that you want 
to display in a register. To select the account that you want to use, open the 
Select Account drop-down list, select the bank account, and then click 
OK. QuickBooks displays the Register window, shown in Figure 4-13.
If QuickBooks shows the register of an account other than what you want to 
see, choose Banking ➪ Use Register again. The Use Register dialog box (refer to 
Figure 4-12) should appear.
The Use Register dialog box actually lets you select any balance sheet account. 
You can select a nonbank account, too.
2.	 Use the Date column of the register to record the date of the deposit, 
payment, or transfer.
You can enter a date by using mm/dd/yyyy date format. Or you can click the 
small calendar button to the right of the Date field to display the month that 
shows the date and then click the day button that corresponds to the date you 
want to enter.

dialog box.

account.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      243
3.	 (Optional) Assign a transaction number.
Use the Number column to uniquely identify the transaction. In the case of 
check transactions, for example, use the Number field to record the check 
number. For transfers and deposits, you may not need to record a number.
4.	 Use the Payee field to record the payee for a check, the customer paying 
a deposit, or some other bit of information in the case of a transfer 
transaction.
Note that you can select an existing customer, vendor, or a name from one of 
the QuickBooks lists by clicking the down-arrow button at the right end of the 
Payee field. When you do this, QuickBooks displays a list of names. Click the 
one that you want to select.
5.	 Provide the transaction amount.
Use the Payment column if you’re describing a check transaction or a transfer 
that moves money from the account. Use the Deposit column if you’re 
describing a deposit into the account or transfer into the account. Enter the 
amount of the transaction in the appropriate column — Payment or Deposit — 
by using dollars and cents.
6.	 Identify the account.
For check transactions, you use the Account field to identify the expense that a 
check pays or the asset that a check purchases. For deposit transactions, you 
use the Account field to identify the sales revenue account that the deposit 
represents. For Transfer transactions, use the Account field to identify the 
other bank account involved in the transaction. You can enter the Account 
name in the Account box, or you can open the Account drop-down list and 
select the account that you want.
7.	 (Optional) Provide a memo description.
If you want, use the Memo field to provide a brief description of the payment, 
deposit, or transfer transaction.
8.	 (Optional) Split the transaction.
If a transaction needs to be assigned to more than one account, click the Splits 
button. QuickBooks then displays the Splits area in the register window, shown 
in Figure 4-14. The Splits area lets you split a transaction among several 
accounts. A check that pays both office supplies and rent expenses, for 
example, can be split between these two expense accounts. Similarly, a deposit 
transaction that represents both product revenue and service revenue can be 
split between these two accounts. When you finish with the Splits area, click its 
Close button.

244      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
You can erase the Splits detail by clicking the Clear button. You can also tell 
QuickBooks to recalculate the payment or deposit amount by using the split 
transaction data simply by clicking the Recalc button.
The Splits area also lets you do something that isn’t possible inside the regular 
register: You can use the Splits area to record customer and job information, 
class information, and billing information. To do this, use the Customer:Job 
column, the Billable column, and the Class column.
9.	 To record a transaction in the register, click the Record button.
QuickBooks recalculates the account balance and adjusts the ending balance 
for the new transaction.
Using Register window commands  
and buttons
The Register window provides several buttons and boxes to enable you to more 
easily work with the Register window and control the way it looks.
The Go To button
Clicking the Go To button displays the Go To dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-15. 
The Go To dialog box lets you search for a transaction in the Register window, 
FIGURE 4-14:  
The Register 
window, showing 
the Splits area.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      245
such as a transaction in which the Payee/Name uses some name. You can click 
the Back and Next buttons to move to the previous or next transactions that also 
match the search criteria. To remove the Go To dialog box from the QuickBooks 
program window, of course, click Cancel.
The Print button
The Print button, when clicked, displays the Print Register dialog box (see 
­Figure  4-16). The Print Register dialog box lets you print a copy of the regis-
ter for the account. The Print Register dialog box provides Date Range From and 
Date Range Through boxes, where you specify the range of dates you want on the 
printed register. The Print Register dialog box also provides a Print Splits Detail 
check box, which you can select to tell QuickBooks that you want to see the split 
transaction detail.
The Edit Transaction button
The Edit Transaction button, when clicked, tells QuickBooks to display whatever 
window you used to originally record the selected transaction. Remember that the 
Register window shows all the transactions for the bank account. These transac-
tions include, for example, checking account transactions that you recorded when 
using the Write Checks window. If you click the Edit Transaction button when the 
selected transaction is one that you originally recorded in the Write Checks win-
dow, QuickBooks displays that transaction again in the Write Checks window. Edit 
the transaction in the Write Checks window, and click either Save & Close or Save 
& New to save your changes.
The QuickReport button
Click the QuickReport button to display a report that summarizes register informa-
tion for the payee or name in the selected transaction. If the selected transaction 
FIGURE 4-15:  
The Go To 
dialog box.
FIGURE 4-16:  
The Print Register 
dialog box.

246      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
is a check written to Great Globs of Clay, clicking QuickReport builds a quick-and- 
dirty report that shows the transactions we have paid to Great Globs of Clay (see 
Figure 4-17).
The Download Bank Statement button
Click the Download Bank Statement button to tell QuickBooks that you want to use 
the Internet to connect to your bank’s computer and download recent transac-
tions. Note that you need to prearrange this service with your bank and that this 
button is called Setup Bank Feeds until you set up an online account. (For more 
information about QuickBooks’s online banking features, see “Bank Feeds com-
mand” later in this chapter.)
The 1-Line check box
QuickBooks lets you display a one-line or a two-line version of the register (see 
Figure 4-18). By default, QuickBooks assumes that you want the two-line ver-
sion of the register, but you can display a more compact, one-line version of the 
­register by selecting the 1-Line check box.
The Sort By box
The Sort By drop-down list lets you choose how QuickBooks arranges register 
information. QuickBooks lets you arrange register information by date, by amount, 
by order entry date, and by several other sorting methods as well. To change the 
way that QuickBooks orders or organizes the information in the register, open the 
Sort By drop-down list, and choose the ordering sequence that you want.

Using Edit Menu Commands
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I describe how to record check trans-
actions, deposit transactions, and transfers between accounts, and how to use the 
register. You often don’t need to know any more than I’ve already described to 
use the windows discussed and record the transactions described. Know, however, 
that when you’re working with a register, the Edit menu provides several other 
useful commands for entering new transactions, editing existing transactions, 
and reusing transaction information:
»
» Edit Check/Deposit: This command is equivalent to the Edit Transaction 
button (which appears in the Register window). If you choose the Edit Check/
Deposit command, QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window so that you 
can edit the transaction with that tool.
The command name changes depending on the selected transaction. You see 
the Edit Check command if the selected transaction is a check. You see the 
Edit Deposit command if the selected transaction is a deposit.
»
» New Check: This command displays the Write Checks window so that you can 
record a new check transaction and record it in the register.
FIGURE 4-18:  
A one-line version 
of the register.

248      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
»
» Delete Check: The Delete Check command deletes the selected transaction 
from the register. (The name of this command changes depending on the 
transaction selected in the register.)
»
» Memorize Check: This command, which appears when appropriate, memo-
rizes the selected transaction, adds the check information to the memorized 
transaction list, and thereby allows you to reuse the check information at 
some point in the future. (If you have a transaction that you record frequently, 
such as every month, memorizing the transaction and then reusing it often 
saves you data entry time.)
»
» Void Check: This command, which also appears when appropriate, lets you 
void the selected check transaction.
»
» Copy/Paste: The Copy command copies the currently selected check. If you 
choose the Paste command, QuickBooks pastes the just-copied check into the 
next empty row of the register.
»
» Go To Transfer: This command goes to the other side of a transfer transac-
tion. The Go To Transfer command, obviously, makes sense and works only if 
the selected transaction is a transfer.
»
» Transaction History: This command displays a window that lists all the 
transactions related to the current selected transaction. Typically, you use this 
Transaction History command when the selected transaction is a customer 
payment. In this case, the Transaction History window would list all the 
transactions related to the customer payment transaction. You can use the 
Transaction History window to go quickly to one of the related transactions. 
Simply click the transaction listed. You can also edit transactions shown in the 
Transaction History window. Click the transaction and then click the Edit 
Payment button to do this.
»
» Notepad: Choose this command to display the Notepad dialog box so you 
can jot down free-form information about the selected transaction’s payee. 
The Notepad dialog box includes a Date Stamp button you can use to record 
the time when you jot a note and a Print button you can use to print hard 
copies.
»
» Change Account Color: This command displays the Change Account Color 
dialog box, which lets you choose another color for the striping shown in the 
Register window. To select another color, click the color square that shows the 
color that you want and then click OK.
»
» Use Register: This command displays the Use Register dialog box, which lets 
you select the account that you want to display in a register.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      249
»
» Use Calculator: This command, predictably, displays the Windows Calculator. 
If you have questions about how to work with the Windows Calculator, refer 
to the Windows documentation, the Windows Help file, or a book such as 
Windows 10 For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Andy Rathbone (John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc.).
»
» Find: The Find command displays either the Simple tab of the Find window, 
shown in Figure 4-19, or the Advanced tab of the Find window, shown later in 
this section. Both tabs allow you to search your register and find transactions.
To use the Simple tab, use the Transaction Type, Customer:Job, Date, Invoice 
#, and Amount boxes to describe the transaction you want. Enter as much 
information as you can, but note that if you enter incorrect information, 
QuickBooks (obviously) won’t be able to find the transaction you’re looking 
for. After you describe the transaction in as much detail as you can, click the 
Find button. QuickBooks displays a list of transactions that match your search 
criteria (see Figure 4-20). To go to a particular transaction, click the transaction 
in the list and then click the Go To button.
FIGURE 4-19:  
The Simple tab of 
the Find window.

250      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
The Advanced tab, shown in Figure 4-21, lets you describe a much more 
precise and complex set of search criteria. Essentially, you can describe in 
painful detail a filter that QuickBooks should apply to each field that’s 
recorded for a transaction. If you want to filter based on the account, for 
example, select the account entry in the Filter list. Then open the Account 
drop-down list, and choose one of the account groupings that QuickBooks 
displays. In Figure 4-21, the All Accounts entry is selected so all accounts show, 
but you can choose the Select Accounts entry instead to display a dialog box 
that you can use to individually select the accounts you want to look for. The 
Include Split Detail? radio buttons let you indicate whether you want to use 
split detail information. After you describe the filter or filters you want to use, 
click the Find button. As with the Simple tab of the Find window, QuickBooks 
displays a list of all the transactions that match your filter. To go to one of the 
transactions listed, click it and then click the Go To button.
The Report button, which appears on both on the Simple tab and the 
Advanced tab, creates a report of all the transactions that the Find command 
has found. You can print this report — QuickBooks displays it in a regular 
report window — by choosing the File ➪ Print Report command or by clicking 
the Print button that appears at the top of the Report window. The Simple and 
Advanced tabs of the Find window also include a Reset button. I should say 
that if you want to start your search over by using a new set of search criteria 
or filtering criteria, simply click the Reset button.
FIGURE 4-20:  
Results of a 
simple search in 
the Find window.

CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      251
»
» Search: This command opens a search window that you can use to search for 
specific information within your company file.
»
» Preferences: This command enables you to change the way that QuickBooks 
works so that it best matches your firm’s accounting requirements. Book 2, 
Chapter 3 discusses the Preferences command in detail.
Reconciling the Bank Account
You can reconcile a bank account with surprising speed in QuickBooks. To rec-
oncile the bank account, choose the Banking ➪ Reconcile command. QuickBooks 
displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, shown in Figure 4-22.
To begin reconciling your account, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the account that you want to reconcile from the Account drop-
down list.
FIGURE 4-21:  
The Advanced 
tab of the Find 
window.

252      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
2.	 Use the Statement Date box to identify the ending date of the bank 
statement that you’re using in your reconciliation.
As is always the case with date fields in QuickBooks, you enter the date in mm/
dd/yyyy date format or click the calendar button and use it to select the correct 
date.
3.	 Enter the ending balance shown on your bank account statement in the 
Ending Balance box.
4.	 Use the Service Charge and Interest Earned boxes to identify the amount 
of any service charge or of any interest, the date of any such transaction, 
and the account that you use to track those charges.
If your bank statement shows a service charge, enter the service charge 
amount in the first Service Charge box. Enter the date of the service charge 
transaction in the Service Charge Date box. Finally, choose an appropriate 
expense account for tracking service charges from the Service Charge Account 
drop-down list. (Bank charges, for example, is a good account to track service 
charges.)
In a similar fashion, use the Interest Earned boxes to describe any interest 
earned on a business account.
5.	 Review the statement information.
After you enter information about the bank account, the statement date, the 
ending balance, and any service charge or interest earned information, take a 
moment to review the information and confirm that it is correct. You’ll have a 
whale of a time reconciling an account if the amount that you’re trying to 
reconcile to is incorrect.
6.	 After you make sure that everything is hunky-dory, click the Continue 
button.
QuickBooks displays the Reconcile window, as shown in Figure 4-23.
FIGURE 4-22:  
The Begin 
Reconciliation 
dialog box.

Managing Cash and 
Bank Accounts
CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      253
7.	 To identify checks and payment transactions that have cleared your 
bank account, click the transactions that have cleared.
The Reconcile window displays two lists of transactions: a list of checks and 
payments, which appears on the left, and a list of deposits and other credits, 
which appears on the right. When you click a transaction, QuickBooks marks 
the transaction with a check mark, indicating that a transaction has cleared. 
You can mark all the transactions in a list as cleared by clicking the Mark All 
button. To mark all the transactions in a list as uncleared, click the Unmark All 
button.
Use the Deposits and Other Credits list to identify those deposit transactions 
that have cleared the bank account. You identify a cleared deposit transaction 
in the same way that you identify a cleared check or payment transaction. You 
can click a transaction, which causes QuickBooks to mark the transaction as 
cleared. You can also use the Mark All and Unmark All buttons to mark or 
unmark all the deposits and other credit transactions at one time.
If you realize that as part of the reconciliation, you’ve incorrectly entered the 
service charge, interest earned, ending balance, or any other information, click 
the Modify button. QuickBooks redisplays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box 
(refer to Figure 4-22). Make the necessary changes, and click Continue to return 
to the Reconcile window.
FIGURE 4-23:  
The Reconcile 
window.

254      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
8.	 Verify that the cleared balance equals the ending balance.
If you provided correct information in the Begin Reconciliation dialog box (refer 
to Figure 4-22), and you correctly identified all the transactions that have 
cleared your account, the ending balance should equal the cleared balance, as 
shown in Figure 4-24.
9.	 When the ending balance equals the cleared balance, click the Reconcile 
Now button.
QuickBooks permanently records your cleared transactions as cleared and 
redisplays the Register window. If you can’t reconcile an account, you can click 
the Leave button. QuickBooks saves your half-completed reconciliation so that 
you can come back later and finish it.
Can I interject a couple of tangential comments here? Good. If you want, you can 
print a little report that summarizes your reconciliation after you click the Recon-
cile Now button. (QuickBooks gives you this option in a dialog box that it displays.) 
You can also click the Previous Reports button to display a dialog box that lets you 
print other old reconciliation reports. You can click the Discrepancy Report but-
ton to produce a report that lists transactions that have been edited since you last 
reconciled the account. Finally, you can click the column headings used in the 
Reconciliation window to sort and re-sort the bank account information.

CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      255
Reviewing the Other Banking Commands
Earlier in this chapter, I describe the most common and useful banking com-
mands. You may not need to use the other commands provided on the Bank-
ing menu. Nevertheless, my compulsive personality requires that I describe these 
other commands.
WHEN YOUR ACCOUNT WON’T BALANCE
If your account won’t reconcile, the problem stems from one of several conditions. 
None of the conditions is hard to describe, but all of them can be pretty hard to fix. 
Here’s a quick overview of what may be causing you trouble and what may be prevent-
ing you from reconciling your account:
•	 Are you working with the right account? That sounds pretty dumb, doesn’t it? 
But if you have several bank accounts, you may be trying to reconcile the wrong 
account or using the wrong statement to reconcile your account.
•	 Are you missing any transactions? If the bank has recorded transactions that you 
haven’t, this causes your ending balance to not equal your cleared balance. Look on 
your statement for any transactions that you’re missing or forgot to record; then 
record these transactions, and mark them as cleared.
•	 Have you recorded transactions correctly? This may also sound silly, but if you 
recorded the transaction, and you’re a few pennies off or a few dollars off —  
­perhaps you’ve transposed a couple of numbers — you won’t be able to reconcile 
your account. I commonly find that I’ve entered a transaction or two wrong per 
month. (Maybe this is because my fingers are too arthritic to correctly record 
amounts.) But it’s probably very common when you’re entering dozens and dozens 
of transactions to occasionally record a transaction wrong. The occasional errors 
need to be fixed before you can reconcile an account.
Note that it’s quite likely — especially when you’re getting started — that you won’t be 
able to reconcile an account because of multiple errors. If you do something like record 
a transaction erroneously and then forget to record a couple of transactions, you’ll need 
to fix each of these errors to reconcile your account.
One final tip: Reconciling an account is much easier if you’re using online banking. I talk 
about how online banking works a little later in this chapter.

256      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Order Checks & Envelopes command
The Order Checks & Envelopes command displays a submenu of commands you 
use to order QuickBooks checks and envelopes or to get information about order-
ing QuickBooks checks and envelopes.
Enter Credit Card Charges command
If you set up a credit card account — this is a credit card account that you or your 
business would use to charge transactions — you can choose the Banking ➪ Enter 
Credit Card Charges command to display a window you can use to enter credit card 
charges.
When you choose the Enter Credit Card Charges command, the Enter Credit Card 
Charges window appears (see Figure 4-25). You can figure out how this window 
works without my help, I’m sure. You identify the credit card account for which 
you want to record transactions, and you describe the credit card purchase by 
using the field at the top of the screen. Then you use the Expenses and Items 
tabs  — these tabs work the same way as the similar tabs in the Write Checks 
­window — to detail the reasons and the accounts affected by your charge.

CHAPTER 4  Managing Cash and Bank Accounts      257
If you click the Download Card Charges button (which appears in the Enter Credit 
Card Charges window), assuming that you’ve set up credit card accounts that allow 
for online services, QuickBooks downloads recent credit card transactions directly 
into the credit card register. Perhaps obviously, for this command to work, several 
prerequisites must be met:
»
» You need a credit card account already set up.
»
» You need to have set up the credit card account for online services.
»
» You need an Internet connection so that QuickBooks can grab the credit card 
transactions from the credit card company.
Bank Feeds command
The Bank Feeds command displays a submenu of commands that you use to 
­conduct online banking and to see which financial institutions (banks, savings 
and loans, and credit unions) let you do online banking. If you want to do online 
banking — which can save businesses a ton of time — call your existing bank  
and ask whether it provides the service. If it does, ask for a sign-up packet and 
for specific instructions on how to get going with online banking. If you don’t like 
the idea of calling your bank directly, choose the Set Up Bank Feed for Account 
command from the Bank Feeds submenu. This command walks you through the 
process of applying for and setting up online financial services.
If you want to learn more about online banking, you choose the Participating 
Financial Institutions command to see which banks play well with QuickBooks. 
And you can choose the Learn about Online Bill Payment command for online bill 
payment options when your bank doesn’t play well with QuickBooks but you don’t 
want to change banks.
The Bank Feeds submenu also provides the Import Web Connect File command, 
which lets you open a transaction file from your bank (if that’s the way your bank 
does online banking); and the Change Bank Feeds Mode command, which lets you 
tweak the way the online banking window looks.
Can I close out this discussion of online banking with an editorial comment? 
Online banking is a real time-saver for business owners. If you’re not using online 
banking, you really should have a pretty darn good reason for not doing so.

Loan Manager
The Loan Manager command displays a window that lists loan accounts you’ve 
set up. This listing of loan accounts, by itself, isn’t all that special, but the Loan 
Manager window does something else that is special: If you click the Add a Loan 
button, QuickBooks collects loan information from you so that it can break loan 
payments into principal and interest.
Other Names list
The Other Names list displays a window that lists all the other names you’ve 
used to record transactions. Individuals and businesses that appear in your Other 
Names list aren’t customers, vendors, or employees. In other words, the Other 
Names list includes names that don’t neatly fit into one of the standard categories.

CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      259
Paying Employees
Q
uickBooks provides two do-it-yourself options for paying employees: Basic 
Payroll (which usually means that your accountant helps you with the 
payroll tax forms) and Enhanced Payroll (which means that QuickBooks 
helps you with the payroll tax forms). This chapter describes the Basic Payroll 
option. With the Basic Payroll option, you do most of the work yourself, but you 
don’t pay very much for your payroll processing.
Would you be terribly offended if I offered you a bit of friendly advice about a third 
option for doing payroll? If you’re not an accountant, consider splurging a bit 
and going with one of the full-service payroll providers, such as ADP or Paychex. 
Having ADP or Paychex do your payroll greatly simplifies your payroll accounting 
work and — in my experience — saves you money over time.
If you go with a payroll provider, you can stop reading this chapter right now. 
­Seriously. All you need to do is telephone the payroll service company and 
say “Help!”
Setting Up Basic Payroll
To set up do-it-yourself payroll, you step through a web-based interview. To 
start this interview, choose the Employees➪  Payroll➪  Turn on Payroll in Quick-
Books command. QuickBooks displays the QuickBooks Online Subscription (Intuit 
QuickBooks Payroll Services) page, shown in Figure 5-1.

260      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
You may need to click a button to expand the Turn on Payroll in QuickBooks 
­window so you see both the Basic Payroll and Enhanced Payroll options. In 
essence, if you choose the Basic Payroll option, either you or your accountant will 
need to remit payroll taxes and then prepare and file payroll tax returns. If you 
choose the Enhanced Payroll option, QuickBooks will help you remit the payroll 
tax deposits and then either prepare or mostly prepare the payroll tax returns 
for you.
You choose the payroll option you want by clicking its Try It Free button. Quick-
Books then displays another web page of information that describes your payment 
options and any special discounts. (Sometimes you get better pricing and a special 
discount by signing up for a year, for example.)
Intuit’s pricing for its payroll services changes, but at the time I’m ­writing 
(­summer 2016), the Basic Payroll service costs around $200 per year, and 
Enhanced Payroll costs close to $300 per year.
Even though you have two QuickBooks payroll options, in this chapter I assume 
that you want to use the Basic Payroll option, which is truly a do-it-yourself 
­solution. You do the work. You need to understand federal and state payroll tax 
rules. You don’t have to pay much, however.
FIGURE 5-1:  
The first payroll 
setup web page.

Paying Employees
CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      261
To choose the Basic Payroll option, click the Continue button when QuickBooks 
displays the next screen of additional information about the pricing and features 
of the Basic Payroll option. QuickBooks then collects your credit card information 
(so it can bill you for the service).
Signing up for a payroll service
To sign up for the payroll service after you’ve selected a particular option, you 
fill in a series of web-page forms. Along the way, you enter your business name 
and address, and give your firm’s employer identification number (EIN). To move 
through the web-page forms, you click the Continue and Back buttons. Quick-
Books steps you through the sign-up process very efficiently. Simply follow the 
onscreen instructions to describe how your company processes payroll.
But let me issue a warning: When you do set up your company information for 
payroll, QuickBooks asks for a bunch of information. I won’t repeat the instruc-
tions that the web pages provide, but you do need to fully describe how you pay 
your employees, to whom you remit deductions, and other stuff like that. Care-
fully read the instructions that QuickBooks provides. This takes some time. If you 
get into trouble, you may want to get an outside accountant’s help to set up the 
Enhanced Payroll service.
Setting up employees
After you set up your company information for payroll, you’re ready to set up 
employees for payroll. As part of the Basic Payroll setup process, QuickBooks dis-
plays a web page where you may add your employees. You may also add employees 
by displaying the Employees Center. (Choose the Employees➪  Employee Center 
command, and click the New Employee button.) When you click the New Employee 
button, QuickBooks displays the Personal tab of the New Employee window, as 
shown in Figure 5-2.
To describe an employee, you complete the fields supplied on the Personal tab. 
All this stuff is self-explanatory; you enter the person’s name in the Legal Name 
boxes. The employee’s first name goes in the First box, the middle initial goes in 
the M.I. box, and so forth.
You click the Address & Contact tab (not shown) to collect and store the employ-
ee’s mailing address and other contact information, such as his or her telephone 
number.

262      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
If you want to collect and store additional information for an employee (such as 
his bank account number for direct deposit), you click the Additional Info tab (also 
not shown). This tab provides a Define Field button that you can use to collect 
custom bits of information about an employee. To use the Custom Field option, 
click the Define Field button and then use the Define Field dialog box to define the 
fields that you want to add.
Providing payroll and tax information
Use the Payroll Info tab to describe how an employee’s salary or wages are cal-
culated, as shown in Figure 5-3. Use the Payroll Schedule drop-down list to set 
up a regular payroll schedule (such as weekly or semimonthly) and to assign the 
employee to the payroll schedule. Use the Pay Frequency drop-down list to iden-
tify the pay period. Optionally, if you’ve turned on QuickBooks’s class tracking 
feature, use the Class drop-down list to classify payments to this employee. You 
enter the payroll item in the Earnings area. If an employee earns an annual sal-
ary of $30,000, for example, you enter the salary payroll item in the Item Name 
column. Then you enter the annual salary of $30,000 in the Hourly/Annual Rate 
column. If you’ve set up QuickBooks to handle other additions or deductions on 
a payroll check (expense reimbursements or pension deductions), use the Addi-
tions, Deductions and Company Contributions area to describe these items and 
the item amounts.

tab of the New 
Employee 
­window.

CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      263
To describe which taxes an employee pays, click the Taxes button. QuickBooks 
displays the Taxes dialog box, shown in Figure 5-4. Use the Federal tab to identify 
the employee’s filing status, number of allowances claimed, and any extra with-
holding specified. In addition, use the Subject To check boxes to indicate whether 
this employee is subject to Medicare, Social Security, or federal unemployment 
tax, or whether the employee is eligible for an earned income credit. Note that not 
all employees are subject to Medicare and Social Security taxes. Consult your tax 
adviser for more information.

tab of the New

window.

window.

264      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
The State tab supplies boxes that you can use to describe state taxes, obviously. 
I don’t show the State tax tab here because the State tax tab varies depending on 
the state you’re in.
The Other tab lets you describe and store any local tax information, such as a city 
income tax. Again, what you see on the Other tab depends on your locality. For this 
reason, I don’t show it here.
If you click the Sick/Vacation button on the Payroll Info tab of the New Employee 
dialog box, you see the Sick and Vacation dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5. This 
dialog box lets you specify how sick or vacation pay and personal leave time are 
accrued payroll period by payroll period. You can specify the number of sick or 
vacation leave hours in the Hours Available As Of text box at the time you’re set-
ting up payroll. You can use the Accrual Period drop-down list to specify how 
often sick or vacation pay should be accrued. If sick or vacation pay is accrued, 
use the Hours Accrued box to identify how many hours of sick or vacation time 
an employee earns each paycheck or hour, or at the beginning of the year. If you 
have set a maximum number of sick hours or vacation hours that an employee can 
accumulate, enter this value in the Maximum Number of Hours box. If you want 
to reset the sick hours and vacation hours to zero at the beginning of each year, 
select the Reset Hours Each New Year? check box.
The Vacation area of the Sick and Vacation dialog box works the same way as the 
Sick area. Enter the number of vacation hours available in the Hours Available As 
Of box. Use the Accrual Period drop-down list to specify how often employees 
FIGURE 5-5:  
The Sick and 
Vacation  
dialog box.

Paying Employees
CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      265
earn vacation time. Use the Hours Accrued and Maximum Number of Hours check 
boxes to control how vacation-time accrual calculations work. Finally, select the 
Reset Hours Each New Year? check box to zero out vacation time at the beginning 
of each new year.
If you’ve chosen to use the direct-deposit option, click the Direct Deposit but-
ton on the Payroll Info tab of the New Employee dialog box (refer to Figure 5-3). 
QuickBooks prompts you to supply the information necessary to directly deposit 
checks for employees.
Providing other employment-related information
If you select the Employment Info tab of the New Employee dialog box, Quick-
Books displays the tab you use to store the hire date, fire date, and similar bits of 
employment data.
Setting up year-to-date amounts
If you’re setting up the Basic Payroll service at the very beginning of the busi-
ness’s operation or at the beginning of the year, you don’t have to set up any year- 
to-date amounts (because all the year-to-date amounts equal zero). If you’re 
switching to the Basic Payroll service sometime in midyear, however, you do need 
to set up year-to-date amounts. For this reason, the QuickBooks Basic Payroll 
setup wizard walks you through the process for recording year-to-date amounts.
If an outside service bureau such as ADP or Paychex has been doing your payroll 
processing, the final payroll report from this outside service bureau probably sup-
plies all the information that you need to set up the Basic Payroll service. If you’ve 
been working with a bookkeeper or accountant to get payroll done, you should be 
able to get this person’s help to describe year-to-date payroll amounts.
Checking your payroll setup data
As part of the Basic Payroll setup process, QuickBooks (or you) may identify pay-
roll data that doesn’t seem right; perhaps an employee whom you know you’ve 
paid shows no year-to-date wages. In this case, you correct the incorrect data by 
following the onscreen instructions. Note, however, that QuickBooks Basic Payroll 
setup process may also identify suspicious payroll data that is, in fact, correct. In 
the state of Washington (where I live), for example, officers aren’t subject to state 
unemployment insurance if they so elect. QuickBooks doesn’t know this, however, 
so it flags officers who aren’t marked as being subject to state unemployment 
insurance as possible errors.

266      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
Again, if you don’t feel comfortable answering some of these payroll setup ques-
tions, get an accountant’s help. Quite frankly, when you have an outside service 
bureau prepare your payroll checks, you’re really paying for that firm’s expertise 
and knowledge about how all this payroll processing stuff works. You’re not really 
paying for the computer time and the paper on which the checks are written.
Scheduling Payroll Runs
The Basic Payroll setup process also steps you through the work of scheduling 
your payroll runs. In other words, if you’ll run your payroll every week, twice a 
month, or at whatever interval, the setup process asks you to describe the sched-
ule. Again, as with the other tasks that the Basic Payroll setup process helps you 
with, all you need to do is provide a few bits and pieces of information.
Paying Employees
After you go through the steps required to set up the QuickBooks payroll pro-
cessing capability, paying employees — thank goodness — is pretty easy. To pay 
employees, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Employees➪  Pay Employees➪  Scheduled Payroll.
QuickBooks displays the Employee Center window (see Figure 5-6).
2.	 Start the scheduled payroll you want to run.
To start the scheduled payroll run you want to run, select it in the list box at the 
top of the Employee Center window.
3.	 Click the Start Scheduled Payroll button.
4.	 Supply the payroll check date, and use the Check Date box to supply the 
date that you want to appear on payroll checks.
5.	 Identify the date on which the payroll period ends in the Pay Period 
Ends box.
6.	 Use the Bank Account drop-down list to identify the bank account on 
which you want to write checks.
7.	 Verify the employees whom you want to pay.
QuickBooks lists the active employees included in the scheduled payroll. You 
want to make sure that the list of selected employees is right. You can click 
listed employees to select and unselect them.

Paying Employees
CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      267
8.	Click Continue.
QuickBooks calculates the payroll checks and payroll deduction amounts for 
each of the selected employees.
9.	To accept a previewed paycheck described or shown in the dialog box, 
click its Create Paychecks button.
QuickBooks displays a dialog box that lets you print paychecks or pay stubs for 
direct deposit.
10.	Click the Print Paychecks or Print Pay Stubs button, and follow the 
onscreen instructions.
When you click either button, QuickBooks displays the Select Paychecks/Pay 
Stubs to Print dialog box. You should confirm the bank account on which you 
want to write the checks. If you’re printing checks, you should also use the First 
Check Number box to supply the preprinted form number shown on the first 
payroll check that you’ll print. You should also confirm that the employee 
paychecks listed in the dialog box are those that you want to print.
11.	After you confirm that the paycheck printing information is correct, 
click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Print Checks dialog box (the same one that you use to 
print any check).
FIGURE 5-6:  
The Employee 
Center window.

268      BOOK 3  Bookkeeping Chores
12.	Print checks in the usual fashion.
If you want to deselect a paycheck for printing, click the check column to 
remove the check mark and, thereby, deselect the paycheck.
13.	Distribute the paychecks or pay stubs.
Obviously, after you print the checks, you sign and then distribute them. I’ll 
leave you to your own devices here. I’m sure that you know how to find 
employees whom you need to pay and, furthermore, how to hand them their 
paychecks. Heck, they’re probably standing beside your desk right now, waiting 
for you to finish the payroll checks anyway.
Editing and Voiding Paychecks
Be careful when you want to change payroll check information. Payroll checks 
are a little trickier than regular checks because the information from the payroll 
checks affects a bunch of payroll counters. Payroll checks bump up someone’s 
gross wages for the year, for example, and also affect the deduction amounts. For 
this reason, when you want to make a change or void a paycheck that you previ-
ously created, you choose the Employees➪  Edit/Void Paychecks command. When 
you do this, QuickBooks displays the Edit/Void Paychecks window. This window 
lists paychecks that you’ve previously created and printed. To change one of the 
paychecks listed, double-click the paycheck. When QuickBooks displays the Pay-
checks window, click the Paycheck Detail button. When QuickBooks displays the 
Review Paychecks window, use it to make the appropriate change to the paycheck. 
Note that you can change other details, such as the name or address, by using the 
Paycheck window.
To void the paycheck shown in the Paycheck window, choose the Edit➪  Void Pay-
check command.
After you edit or void a check, click the Save & Close or the Save & New button to 
save your changes to the paycheck.
Paying Payroll Liabilities
Amounts that you withhold from employees’ paychecks become liabilities that 
you later need to pay. If you withhold federal income tax deductions, you need to 
remit those payments to the Internal Revenue Service.

Paying Employees
CHAPTER 5  Paying Employees      269
To pay payroll tax liabilities, choose the Employees➪  Payroll Taxes and 
­Liabilities➪  Pay Scheduled Liabilities command. QuickBooks displays the Employee 
Center window, which lets you select the payroll liabilities you want to pay. Click 
the liability you want to pay and then click the View/Pay button. QuickBooks 
writes a check to pay the selected liability. You print this check in the usual way.
How quickly you need to remit any payroll taxes triggered by payroll depends 
on a variety of factors, including the size of the deposit. But a good practice is to 
immediately remit any amounts you owe. Typically, the government agency in 
question allows you to easily and electronically make tax deposits using a website. 
The US Treasury’s https://www.eftps.gov website, for example, lets you easily 
make federal tax deposits in this manner. In fact, you’re required to use the EFTPS 
system if you pay more than $2,500 a quarter in payroll taxes.

For Accountants Only
I
n this short chapter, I want to quickly go over stuff that accountants need or 
want to know. Because I assume that you’re an accountant, I go a little faster 
here than I do in other chapters of this book. Also, I don’t provide blow-by-blow 
instructions for working with the windows and dialog boxes that this chapter 
discusses.
If you find yourself just a wee bit frustrated with me at this point, go ahead and 
peruse the paragraphs of this chapter — keeping in mind that what I discuss in 
this chapter is pretty advanced accounting stuff. You don’t want to do the things 
that this chapter talks about unless you really know your debits and credits. And 
if you do know your debits and credits, you should find the information I provide 
here to be all that you need.
Working with QuickBooks Journal Entries
QuickBooks makes it easy for you — an accountant — to record journal entries. 
If you’ve spent any time working with QuickBooks, you may know that most of

the journal entries that get recorded in the QuickBooks data file are recorded 
­automatically. If somebody writes a check, for example, QuickBooks records the 
journal entry for that. When somebody creates an invoice, again, QuickBooks 
records the journal entry for that.
In some cases, however, somebody — probably you — needs to record a jour-
nal entry to get some transaction into the QuickBooks data file. You use journal 
entries to record depreciation, to accrue liabilities, and to record the disposal of 
assets, for example.
Recording a journal entry
To record a journal entry, choose Company➪  Make General Journal Entries. 
­QuickBooks displays the Make General Journal Entries window, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
You can probably figure out how to use the Make General Journal Entries ­window 
yourself. You enter the general journal entry date in the Date box. You use the 
Entry No. box to number journal entries or to assign them some meaningful 
code. After you provide this basic information, you use the columns of the Make 
­General Journal Entries window to record the journal entry. You don’t need me 
FIGURE 1-1:  
The Make 
General Journal 
Entries window.

For Accountants Only
CHAPTER 1  For Accountants Only      275
to tell you that the general ledger account number or name goes in the Account 
column, the debit amount in the Debit column, and the credit amount in the 
Credit column. You may find it useful, though, to be reminded that you can use 
the Memo column to enter some description of the debit or credit; you can use the 
Name column to identify the customer, vendor, employee, or other name associ-
ated with the credit or debit; you can use the Billable column to indicate that the 
debit or credit should be listed as an amount to be billed to the named customer; 
and you can use the Class column (if you’ve turned on class tracking) to classify 
the debit or credit.
My technical editor, who’s also a CPA, reminds me that you should never put a 
name in the first row of the journal entry. If you do, that name will be associated 
with every line of that journal entry when you view reports in QuickBooks, even if 
the name relates only to the first line.
If you do want to associate names with lines of a journal entry, one way to do this 
cleanly is to leave the first line of the journal entry blank so that no stray entries 
become inadvertently associated with reports.
Reversing a journal entry
To reverse a journal entry, first display the Make General Journal Entries window 
by choosing the Company➪  Make General Journal Entries command. QuickBooks 
displays the Make General Journal Entries window (refer to Figure 1-1). Use the 
Previous and Next buttons to page through general journal entries that you’ve 
already entered. Found the entry? Good.
How you reverse this entry depends on which version of QuickBooks you’re using:
»
» If you’re using QuickBooks Pro: Print the general journal entry by clicking 
the Print button. Then, using the printed journal entry as a reference source, 
enter a new journal, except with the debits and credits reversed. In other 
words, if the to-be-reversed journal entry debits cash for $500 and credits 
interest income for $500, you enter a journal entry that credits cash for $500 
and debits interest income for $500.
»
» If you’re using QuickBooks Premier or QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions: 
When you find the journal entry that you want to reverse, click the Reverse 
button. (The Reverse button appears along the top edge of the Main tab of the 
Make General Journal Entries window.) QuickBooks reverses the general 
journal entry by entering a transaction in the next accounting month with the 
debits and credits flip-flopped.

276      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
The Adjusting Entry check box, available in the Make General Journal Entries 
­window in some versions of QuickBooks, indicates that the journal entry is a 
­special entry made after the fact by the accountant. You can print a report of just 
those special “adjusting entries.”
Book 1, Chapter 1 discusses the basics of accounting. Book 1, Chapter 2 describes 
basic bookkeeping, including how debits and credits work. Book 1, Chapter  3 
describes how to do special accounting magic tricks, including how to and why 
to enter reversing journal entries. If you find yourself in this chapter even though 
you’re not a degreed accountant, you may want to peruse the information in those 
chapters to understand what journal entries are and why in the world one would 
want to reverse one.
Editing journal entries
Typically, you won’t want to fool around and later change the journal entries. If 
you do feel the need to make changes, however, QuickBooks provides an Edit menu 
with commands that you can use for just this purpose. For one, QuickBooks sup-
plies a Delete General Journal command that you can use to delete the journal entry 
shown in the Make General Journal Entries window. QuickBooks also supplies a 
Void General Journal command that you can use to void the general journal entry 
shown in the window. Typically — and again, you already know this — you don’t 
want to delete general journal entries. Instead, you want to void them. Enough said.
Updating Company Information
The Company menu supplies a bunch of commands in addition to the Make ­General 
Journal Entry command. Accountants may have occasion to use the ­Company 
Information command, for example. This command enables you to update com-
pany name and address information, fiscal and tax year settings, the tax form 
used to report profits, and taxpayer identification numbers.
Working with Memorized Transactions
A quick tip: Most of the transactions that people enter in QuickBooks can be mem-
orized by choosing the Edit➪  Memorize command when the transaction appears in 
the open window. You (or someone else) can later reuse a memorized transaction. 
You choose the Lists➪  Memorized Transaction List command, and then, when 
QuickBooks displays the list of memorized transactions (shown in Figure 1-2), 
you double-click the transaction that you want to enter again.

Reviewing the Accountant & Taxes Reports
The Accountant & Taxes menu appears when you choose the Reports➪ ­ 
Accountant & Taxes command. Although I don’t show pictures of each report that 
gets displayed when you choose a command from the Accountant & Taxes menu 
(I do show the Trial Balance report in this section), I want to point out that hid-
den on this submenu are nearly 20 commands and reports that are particularly 
interesting and useful to accountants. The following list identifies these reports:
»
» Adjusted Trial Balance: The Adjusted Trial Balance menu command pro-
duces, of course, a Trial Balance report as of a particular date. What’s unique 
about this version of the Trial Balance report (compared with the one 
described next) is that adjusting journal entries are clearly highlighted. 
(Adjusting journal entries are those that were marked as such when made by 
your accountant.) As noted earlier in the chapter, although Figure 1-1 doesn’t 
show it, some versions of QuickBooks (like the version your accountant 
probably uses) provide an Adjusting Journal Entry check box. You can check 
that box to indicate an adjusting journal entry.
»
» Trial Balance: The Trial Balance menu command produces, of course, a Trial 
Balance report as of a particular date (see Figure 1-3).
FIGURE 1-2:

Transaction 
List window.

278      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
»
» General Ledger: The General Ledger menu command produces a report that 
simply lists the accounts in your Chart of Accounts list and then changes the 
account for the month, year, or whatever accounting period you specify.
»
» Transaction Detail by Account: This menu command produces the report 
that you’d expect: a list of the transactions that affect a particular account.
»
» Adjusting Journal Entries: The Adjusting Journal Entries command produces 
a list of the journal entries that you or someone else marked as being 
adjusting journal entries.
»
» Journal: The Journal menu command produces a report that lists transactions 
by transaction type and number.
»
» Audit Trail: The Audit Trail report is pretty important for accountants —  
particularly for accountants who are concerned or worried that transactions 
have changed when they shouldn’t have changed. The Audit Trail report lists 
transactions by the person entering the transactions. The Audit Trail report 
also lists changes to transactions and identifies who made the changes.
»
» Closing Date Exception Report: If you finalize the accounting data for the 
year (referred to as closing the books) — and you should — the Closing Date 
Exception Report command identifies changes to closed transactions. (Closing 
the QuickBooks data file is described in Book 7, Chapter 2.)

»
» Customer Credit Card Audit Trail: A Customer Credit Card Audit Trail report 
lists only credit card transactions — perfect for people with heavy credit card 
transaction volumes that they can’t make heads or tails of.
»
» Voided/Deleted Transactions Summary: The Voided/Deleted Transactions 
Summary command produces a summary report of voided transactions and 
deleted transactions.
»
» Voided/Deleted Transactions Detail: The Voided/Deleted Transactions 
Detail command produces a detailed listing of all voided transactions and all 
deleted transactions.
»
» Transaction List by Date: The Transaction List by Date report lists transac-
tions in order of date of entry.
»
» Account Listing: The Account Listing report lists all the accounts in your Chart 
of Accounts list. The report also gives the account balance and indicates the 
line on the tax return where the account is reported.
»
» Fixed Asset Listing: The Fixed Asset Listing report lists all the fixed assets in 
your Fixed Assets list.
»
» Income Tax Preparation: The Income Tax Preparation report shows on 
which lines of which tax forms account balances are reported.
»
» Income Tax Summary: The Income Tax Summary report uses your income 
tax preparation data to show what amounts should be reported on what lines 
of your tax forms. If you’re a sole proprietor filing a Schedule C tax form, for 
example, QuickBooks looks at all the accounts that you use to track gross 
receipts or sales. Then it totals the balances in those accounts and shows the 
actual value that should be reported on the gross receipts or sales line of your 
Schedule C tax form.
»
» Income Tax Detail: The Income Tax Detail report gives the same information 
as the Income Tax Summary report, except that this report shows the 
individual accounts that get bunched together to produce the tax line total.
Creating an Accountant’s Copy  
of the QuickBooks Data File
QuickBooks makes it easier for accountants to work with client data files. Consider 
this scenario: You have a client who needs help finishing the year’s accounting 
period. You have two choices. First, you can drive over to his shop, probably get-
ting stuck in traffic along the way, and find yourself wondering whether you can 

280      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
bill the client $150 for your travel time. Second, you can have the client use the 
Accountant’s Copy feature of QuickBooks to send you a copy of the QuickBooks 
data file. You can review this accountant’s copy of the data file, make whatever 
fixes or changes are appropriate, and then send the changes to be made back to 
the client. The client can easily import these changes into his existing QuickBooks 
file and go off on his merry way. Pretty neat, right?
Creating an accountant’s copy
Your client creates the accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file by using his 
version of QuickBooks and the real data file. Then your client creates and sends 
you a file (through postal mail, email, or some other secure electronic format), or 
Intuit, the maker of QuickBooks, sends the file to you. Fortunately, the process is 
very straightforward either way.
Manually handling the accountant’s copy
Here’s what your client needs to do if the client will take care of sending the file 
to you:
1.	 Choose the File➪  Create Copy command.
QuickBooks displays the Save Copy or Backup dialog box (see Figure 1-4), 
asking the client whether he wants
•	 A backup copy of the file, which is a second copy of the QuickBooks file you 
create (usually) so you’ll have a copy of the file in case something bad 
happens to the original QuickBooks data file.
•	 A portable copy of the file, which is a real live copy of the QuickBooks data 
file that’s been slightly scrunched in size so it’s easier to move around (such 
as by emailing the file as an attachment).
•	 An accountant’s copy of the file, which is what I talk about in the opening 
paragraph of this discussion about the accountant’s copy, so I won’t repeat 
myself here.
2.	 Select Accountant’s Copy and then click Next to continue.
3.	 Confirm that you really want an Accountant’s Copy, and click Next.
QuickBooks next displays another dialog box to insist that your poor stressed-
out client confirm that he really wants an accountant’s copy (see Figure 1-5) 
rather than simply a portable copy of the file.

For Accountants Only
CHAPTER 1  For Accountants Only      281
4.	 Specify a dividing date.
When a client clicks the Next button to continue with the creation of an 
accountant’s copy, QuickBooks asks him for the dividing date. Transactions 
falling before this date can be edited only inside the accountant’s copy. 
Transactions falling after this date can be edited inside both the accountant’s 
copy and the client’s copy.
5.	 Click Next to continue.
Another message appears, telling the client that QuickBooks must close all the 
windows to create an accountant’s copy.
6.	 Click OK.
QuickBooks displays an updated Save Accountant’s Copy dialog box, shown in 
Figure 1-6.
FIGURE 1-4:  
The first Save 
Copy or Backup 
dialog box.
FIGURE 1-5:  
The second Save 
Copy or Backup 
dialog box.

282      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
7.	 Name the accountant’s copy.
Use the File Name box of the Save Accountant’s Copy dialog box to name the 
accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file. If necessary, the client can also 
use the Save In drop-down list to specify where the accountant’s copy of the 
QuickBooks data file should be saved.
The client needs to remember where the accountant’s copy of the file gets 
saved. This file is given to the accountant — via email or snail mail, or on a 
disc — so that he can use it.
8.	 Create the file.
After the client names the accountant’s copy of the data file and indicates, if 
necessary, where the accountant’s copy should be saved, the client clicks Save. 
QuickBooks saves an accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file.
Then this data file is transmitted to the accountant by the client. In other words, 
the client needs to snail-mail or email the file.
Your email provider may limit the size of attachments (including QuickBooks 
files) that you can send via email. If the size thing fouls you up, you can upload 
the QuickBooks file to the Intuit website by choosing File➪  Send Company 
File➪  Accountant’s Copy➪  Client Activities➪  Send to Accountant. Intuit sends the 
accountant a message with a clickable link that she can use to grab the file.
Accountant copies use three file types. The Accountant Transfer File (with the 
.qbx file extension) is what a client creates and gives to the accountant. The 
actual Accountant’s Copy (with the .qba file extension) is what the accountant 
works with after he or she opens the Accountant Transfer File. Finally, there’s 
the Accountant Export File (with the .qby file extension), which holds the 
changes that go back to the client.
FIGURE 1-6:  
An updated Save 
Accountant’s 
Copy dialog box.

For Accountants Only
CHAPTER 1  For Accountants Only      283
Obviously, it may not actually be your client who takes these steps; you may have 
to do the dirty work. In either case, however, that’s how the process works. Note, 
however, that the real-time savings for the accountant and the cost savings to the 
client occur when you can get the client to choose the command and work with 
the dialog box. Then you can charge billable time for actually working with Quick-
Books data rather than for fiddle-faddling with the file.
Electronically sending the accountant’s copy
Your client can also send a copy of the QuickBooks accountant’s copy electroni-
cally by using Intuit’s file transfer service. To do this, the client chooses File➪  Send 
Company File➪  Accountant’s Copy➪  Client Activities➪  Send to Accountant. Quick-
Books provides onscreen instructions for sending, or uploading, the accountant’s 
copy to the Intuit server, including the steps for adding a password to secure the 
uploaded file.
After the accountant’s copy is uploaded, the Intuit server sends the accountant 
an email message with a link the accountant can use to download the accoun-
tant’s copy file. As noted, the client provides a password to restrict access to the 
downloaded file, so the accountant needs this password from the client before 
the download. The accountant also needs any QuickBooks password to open the 
downloaded file.
You want to use the Send Company File command or have your clients use the 
Send Company File command if you can. The Send Company File command saves 
you much wailing and gnashing of teeth. It also provides a highly secure way to 
share accountant’s copies. The only problem that I’ve encountered with the pro-
cess, in fact, is that the link in the email message you get from Intuit expires after 
a few days. Accordingly, if your client sends you the file on the first day of your 
two-week vacation, the link won’t work when you get back to the office. The link 
will have expired.
Because the links Intuit sends you do expire after a few days, in our CPA office, 
we actually try to avoid having clients send us their QuickBooks files via the Send 
Company File command. Instead, we ask clients to upload their QuickBooks files 
to our www.sharefile.com. Is it, er, unpatriotic if I say you may want to provide 
the same alternative to your clients?
Using an accountant’s copy
Regardless of whether the client manually transmits an accountant’s copy, emails 
an accountant’s copy, or sends an accountant’s copy via the Intuit file trans-
fer service, you use the accountant’s copy by choosing the File➪  Send Company 
File➪  Accountant’s Copy➪  Open & Convert Transfer File command. When you 

284      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
choose this command, QuickBooks displays a series of message boxes explain-
ing how you work with the accountant’s copy. To move back and forth through 
the message boxes, click Next and Back. After you click Next in the last message 
box, QuickBooks displays the Open Accountant’s Copy Transfer File dialog box 
(not shown).
Use the Look In drop-down list to identify the location of the accountant’s 
copy. If necessary, enter the accountant’s copy filename in the File Name box. 
When you click Open, QuickBooks prompts you to name the accountant’s copy 
and then opens the accountant’s copy. Note that you won’t be able to make the 
same changes to an accountant’s copy that you can make to a regular QuickBooks 
data file. QuickBooks limits the sort of changes that you can make in an accoun-
tant’s copy.
Reusing an accountant’s copy
If you’ve already opened an accountant’s copy file once, you can reuse the accoun-
tant’s copy by choosing the File➪  Open Previous Company command. When you do 
this, QuickBooks displays a list of the company files (including accountant’s copy 
files) that you’ve worked with previously. When you click the accountant’s copy 
you want to work with, QuickBooks opens the data file so that you can continue 
performing your magic.
Exporting client changes
After you’ve used an accountant’s copy to correct transactions or to enter new 
transactions, you export the changes so that they can later be imported into the 
client’s data file. To do this, choose the File➪  Send Company File➪  Accountant’s 
Copy➪  View/Export Changes for Client command. QuickBooks first displays a 
­window that lists the changes you made to the accountant’s copy (not shown). 
Note that you can print this list or create a .pdf file of it by clicking the Print or 
Save As PDF button.
If you click the Create Change File for Client button, QuickBooks displays the 
Save Accountant’s Export to dialog box (not shown). This dialog box works like a 
­standard Windows dialog box for saving a file or document. You use the Save In 
drop-down list to identify the location of the changes file. Then use the File Name 
box to give the file a unique name. When you click Save, QuickBooks saves the 
changes that you’ve made into a file. You later import this file, or have the client 
import this file, into the QuickBooks data file.
If you click the Send Changes to Client button, QuickBooks displays the Save 
Accountant’s Changes dialog box (also not shown). This dialog box collects the 

For Accountants Only
CHAPTER 1  For Accountants Only      285
information necessary to send the client an email with instructions about how to 
import the accountant changes and a link the client can use to retrieve the actual 
accountant’s changes. One neat thing about this option is that QuickBooks tells 
the accountant when the client grabs the changes.
You don’t keep your accountant’s copy of the data file. In other words, the 
accountant’s copy is just a temporary copy of the data file that you use to identify 
and create a set of changes necessary to update or correct the client’s records. 
After you make the changes, you export the changes to a changes file. Then the 
client imports those changes (as discussed in the next section). If you make 
changes again sometime in the near future, you have the client create a new — a 
brand-new — accountant’s copy.
To identify when you’re working with an accountant’s copy, QuickBooks displays 
the parenthetical phrase (Accountant’s Copy) along the top of the QuickBooks pro-
gram window. QuickBooks also identifies regular QuickBooks data files for which 
accountant’s copies have been created by adding the parenthetical phrase (Accoun-
tant’s Copy Exists). This phrase appears only on the QuickBooks program window 
title bar from the point when the client creates the accountant’s copy to the point 
when the client imports changes from the accountant’s copy.
Importing accountant’s changes
Your client imports the changes that you’ve made in the accountant’s copy of the 
data file into her working copy of the data file. To do this, the client chooses the 
File➪  Send Company File➪  Accountant’s Copy➪  Client Activities➪  Import Accoun-
tant’s Changes command.
QuickBooks displays the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 1-7. To use the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box, the client uses 
the Look In drop-down list to identify the location of the changes file. After the 
client identifies the location — this may be a disc with the changes file on it — the 
client should be able to see the change file in the middle of the Import Accoun-
tant’s Changes dialog box. The client can double-click the change file to import 
the changes into his or her QuickBooks data file. QuickBooks, by the way, displays 
a window that highlights the accountant’s changes to the file for the client.
QuickBooks prompts the client to back up the QuickBooks data file. I don’t describe 
that process here, but I go into a lot of detail about how to back up a data file in 
Book 7, Chapter 2.
After the client imports the changes, QuickBooks removes the parenthetical 
phrase (Accountant’s Copy Exists) from the QuickBooks program window title bar.

286      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Canceling accountant’s changes
Here’s a little question for you: What happens if the client gives you an accoun-
tant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file and then realizes that you won’t be making 
changes or that he or she doesn’t want to accept the changes? Bummer, right? 
Well, not really.
When a client creates an accountant’s copy of the QuickBooks data file, ­QuickBooks 
marks the client’s data file as one that can be modified through the accountant’s 
changes. QuickBooks does this to later allow the accountant’s changes. But if 
those changes won’t be made, the client unmarks the data file as available for 
changes. To do this, the client chooses the File➪  Send Company File➪  Accountant’s 
Copy➪  Client Activities➪  Remove Restrictions command. When the client chooses 
this command, QuickBooks displays a message indicating that the client is choos-
ing to cancel out of accountant’s copy mode. After the client chooses this com-
mand, the client won’t be able to import any changes created by using the canceled 
accountant’s copy.
Troubleshooting accountant’s  
copy transfers
Let me leave you with one last comment concerning accountant’s copies. Quite 
honestly, we’ve sometimes found the accountant’s copy system a little, er, 
impractical. Yes, yes, if all goes well, your client gets your journal entries into 
his or her QuickBooks with just a few clicks. But obtaining and then opening 
accountant’s transfer files sometimes doesn’t work smoothly. (Usually, the lack 
of smoothness stems from someone sending us an accountant’s copy created 
with the version of QuickBooks released while Happy Days was still running in 
prime time.)
FIGURE 1-7:  
The Import 
Accountant’s 
Changes 
­dialog box.

For Accountants Only
CHAPTER 1  For Accountants Only      287
Our work-around? If we can’t easily get an accountant’s copy to work, we ask 
for a backup copy of the client’s QuickBooks data file. That backup copy is nearly 
always easy to get open. We then print out the journal entries the clients need to 
enter on their own into their data file.
Using the Client Data Review Commands
Before this chapter ends, let me mention the Client Data Review command, 
which is available in the Accountant Edition versions of QuickBooks Premier and 
­QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions.
Choose the Accountant➪  Client Data Review➪  Client Data Review command to dis-
play the Client Data Review – Start Review dialog box (see Figure 1-8). It starts 
you on a multiple-step process that walks you through the cleanup of a client’s  
QuickBooks data file, including utilities for finding and fixing unapplied cus-
tomer and vendor payments and credits (a bane of bookkeepers everywhere), 
for ­performing wholesale reclassifications of transactions (useful for undoing 
­wholesale errors), for cleaning up undeposited funds accounts and bad payroll 
liability account balances (common problems), and for writing off uncollectible 
invoices.
If you’re using an Accountant Edition of QuickBooks and want some tools for 
quickly cleaning up some poor client’s bookkeeping mess, therefore, check out 
these self-explanatory tools.
If you’re not using an Accountant Edition of QuickBooks, you may want to 
­consider signing up as a QuickBooks Certified Pro Advisor just to get an Accoun-
tants ­Edition copy of QuickBooks. Note that the QuickBooks Certified ProAdvisor 
training covers the Client Data Review tools in detail.

Preparing Financial 
Statements and 
Reports
Q
uickBooks produces — oh, I don’t know — about 100 different financial 
statements and reports. I tried to count them for purposes of writing this 
chapter but lost track after I’d counted 90-some reports. I figured that 
was close enough for my purposes here.
Because QuickBooks contains so many reports, I don’t provide individualized 
descriptions of each report in this chapter. Rather, I talk about some of the stuff 
that you need to do before you prepare financial statements. After covering those 
basics, I talk about how you produce and modify reports, and about some of the 
useful tools that QuickBooks supplies for working with reports.

Some Wise Words Up Front
This point is an obvious one, but you should note that the reports you produce in 
QuickBooks are only as good as the data file. If you have good rich information in 
your QuickBooks data file, if the file doesn’t contain too many mistakes, and if all 
the transactions are entered, your reports should be pretty darn good.
This simple observation has one important ramification: Often, the first step in 
preparing good financial statements and useful reports is collecting all the data. 
In other words, you want to make sure that you’ve entered all the invoices, pur-
chase orders, checks, and so forth. You also want to make sure that any special 
accounting transactions, such as for depreciation or asset sales or accruals, have 
been entered. (Perhaps you need your accountant’s help for this.)
The other chapters of this book talk about how to collect and record all sorts of 
information, so there’s no need to talk more about that here. But just to beat this 
thing to death, the first step in producing a good financial statement or a good 
report is collecting the right information.
Producing a Report
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, QuickBooks provides more than 
100  financial statements and accounting reports. You get to these reports by 
opening the Reports menu. The Reports menu arranges reports in roughly a dozen 
categories, including Company & Financial, Customers & Receivables, Sales, Jobs, 
and Time & Mileage.
To produce just about any of the reports available through the Reports menu, you 
first select the Report category. If you want to produce a standard financial state-
ment, such as a profit and loss statement, you choose the Reports ➪ Company & 
Financial command. QuickBooks displays the Company & Financial submenu, 
which lists the various types of financial statements available.
You pick the submenu command that describes the financial statement that you 
want. If you want a standard profit and loss financial statement, you choose the 
Reports ➪ Company & Financial ➪ Profit & Loss Standard command. After you 
choose the command, QuickBooks displays the Report window for the report that 
you selected, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Statements and Reports
CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      291
Working with the Report Window
If you’re comfortable working with Microsoft Windows, working with the Quick-
Books Report window should be a snap. Typically, a report won’t fit within a win-
dow because it contains too much data. In this case, however, QuickBooks adds 
scroll bars, both vertical and horizontal, that you can use to scroll the window 
around. Pretty straightforward, right?
Along the top edge of the window, QuickBooks displays both buttons and boxes. 
You use these buttons and boxes to change the display of the Report window 
and to control the information shown in the Report window. In the next section, 
I describe each of these buttons and boxes.
Working with Report window buttons
The Report window typically provides ten buttons: Customize Report, Comment 
on Report, Share Template, Memorize, Print, E-mail, Excel, Hide Header, Col-
lapse, and Refresh. You can find out what these command buttons do by experi-
mentation. If you don’t have time for that, read the following sections.
FIGURE 2-1:  
The Report 
window, showing 
a profit and loss 
statement.

292      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Customize Report
The Customize Report button displays the Modify Report dialog box. I won’t go 
into any detail about this command button here because a later section of this 
chapter, “Modifying a Report,” talks in gritty detail about how you use this com-
mand button to customize a report.
Comment on Report
Clicking the Comment on Report button displays the Comment on Report window 
(see Figure 2-2). To use the Comment on Report dialog box, you click a report 
value you want to annotate with a comment. QuickBooks then opens a comment 
box at the bottom of the window, you type your comment, and then you click the 
Save button.
When you’re done commenting on the report, you need to save the annotated 
report. Do so by clicking an OK button when QuickBooks asks whether you want to 
save the commented report. Later on, when you print the report, you can include 
your comments. (This is a great tool for accountants and bookkeepers who want to 
explain what numbers mean to other readers of the financial statements.) You print 
a saved commented report by choosing the report from the Reports ➪ Commented 
Reports menu.

Share Template
The Share Template button, which QuickBooks enables after you’ve customized a 
report in some way, lets you share your customized report settings (not the data) 
with other QuickBooks users. When you click this button, QuickBooks displays the 
Share Template dialog box (not shown). Use the dialog box to give your report 
template a name (ideally a clever name, please), describe your customized report 
with a few choice words, provide your name and email address, and use the option 
buttons provided to indicate whether you want to remain anonymous. When you 
click Share, QuickBooks uploads your report template to an Intuit website where 
other people can grab the template and use it.
Memorize
The Memorize button displays the Memorize Report dialog box, shown in  
Figure 2-3. The Memorize Report dialog box lets you memorize, or permanently 
save, a particular set of report creation settings. After you memorize these settings, 
you can produce the exact same report by choosing the memorized report from 
the Reports ➪ Memorized Reports submenu.
You can save a memorized report in the Memorized Report Group. To do this, 
select the Save in Memorized Report Group check box. Then use the Save in Mem-
orized Report Group drop-down list to select the report group in which the mem-
orized report should be saved.
Print
The Print command button in the top menu bar displays a drop-down list with two 
options: Report and Save As PDF. If you click Report, QuickBooks (sometimes after 
a bit of annoyance) displays the Print Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4, 
which lets you choose how the report should print and where it should print. The 
Settings tab, for example, lets you choose the printer, select a page orientation 
(either portrait or landscape), specify whether you want to print only a range 
of the report’s pages, control page breaking, and adjust the dimensions (width 
and height) of the report. If you click Save As PDF, QuickBooks displays the Save 
Document As PDF dialog box, which lets you create a PDF of report document.
FIGURE 2-3:  
The Memorize 
Report dia-
log box.

294      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
The Margins tab of the Print Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 2-5, lets you 
specify the margins that QuickBooks should use on the printed report pages. You 
specify the top, right, bottom, and left margins in inches.
Click the Preview button, provided on the Print Reports dialog box, to display the 
Preview window. The Preview window shows what your printed report pages look 
like. The window also includes buttons that let you page to the previous and next 
pages of the report, zoom in and out on the report, and print the report.
After you’ve used the Settings tab and the Margins tab to specify how QuickBooks 
should print a report, click Print. QuickBooks sends the report to your printer.
Email
The E-mail command button lets you email either an Excel workbook version of a 
report or a PDF version of a report to someone else as an email attachment.

CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      295
Excel
If you click the Excel button, QuickBooks displays a submenu from which you can 
choose Create New Worksheet or Update Existing Worksheet. Choose Create New 
Worksheet to display the Send Report to Excel dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6. 
The Send Report to Excel dialog box lets you take the information in a report and 
copy it to a file that a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, can eas-
ily open. You can send the copy to a new Excel spreadsheet, to an existing Excel 
spreadsheet, or to a .csv (comma-separated values) file, which can be opened by 
just about any spreadsheet or database program.
To copy the report to a new workbook, select the Create New Worksheet radio 
button. From there, you have the option to create a whole new Excel spreadsheet 
(click the In New Workbook option) or create a new sheet in an existing file by 
using the In Existing Workbook radio button; then enter the path and name of the 
workbook in the text box that QuickBooks opens after you select the radio button. 
(If you don’t know the path and name of the workbook, click the Browse button 
and then use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to locate the workbook file.)
If you want to copy the report to an existing Excel spreadsheet, select the Update 
an Existing Worksheet radio button. QuickBooks causes Excel to refresh the previ-
ously exported workbook.
If you want to replace an existing Excel spreadsheet with the new report you’re 
sending to Excel, select the Replace an Existing Worksheet radio button. Then, 
when QuickBooks opens a text box and adds the Browse button, either enter the 
path and name of the workbook in the text box or click the Browse button, navi-
gate to the workbook, and select it.
FIGURE 2-6:  
The Send 
Report to Excel 
dialog box.

296      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Finally, if you want to copy the report information to a .csv file (a file format 
that can be opened by any spreadsheet or database program), select the Create a 
Comma Separated Values (.csv) File radio button.
If you click the Advanced command button on the Send Report to Excel dialog box, 
QuickBooks displays the Advanced Excel Options dialog box, shown in Figure 2-7. 
This dialog box allows you to control what formatting QuickBooks copies to Excel 
(do this with the QuickBooks Options check boxes), turn certain Excel formatting 
features on or off (do this with the Excel Options check boxes), and set up some 
preliminary workbook printing information in Excel (do this with the Printing 
Options radio buttons). All this stuff relates to how Excel works. If you’re com-
fortable working with Excel, go ahead and make the changes that you want. If you 
aren’t comfortable working with Excel, go ahead and accept QuickBooks’s default 
suggestions. You can change all this stuff later, and rather easily, in Excel.
If you’re working with QuickBooks, know that Excel is a wonderful tool for dig-
ging deeper into your data. In fact, in several chapters of this book, I assume that 
you’re going to exchange information between Excel and QuickBooks. If you’ve 
never done this, or if you haven’t read those chapters yet, consider acquiring Excel 
and then taking the time to learn that powerful spreadsheet product. Also note 
that next time you buy a PC, you may have the option of getting Microsoft Office 
as part of the purchase price. Microsoft Excel comes with Microsoft Office.

CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      297
Hide Header
The Hide Header button and the Collapse button change the way that the report 
appears in the Report window and, if printed, on the page.
You click the Hide Header button to remove the header information, such as the 
company name. If you hide the header, you can click the Hide Header button again 
to replace the header.
Collapse
The Collapse button collapses detail in a report. QuickBooks doesn’t show sub­
accounts in a collapsed report — only accounts.
To uncollapse a report that you previously collapsed, click the Expand button. 
QuickBooks replaces the Collapse button with the Expand button when the Report 
window shows a collapsed report.
Don’t spend any time trying to figure out what the Hide Header and Collapse/
Expand buttons do. If you have a question, simply display a report in the Report 
window and click the command button about which you have a question. The 
changes in the Report window show you what the command button does.
Refresh
The Refresh button tells QuickBooks to update a report’s information for changes 
in the QuickBooks data file. This sounds crazy at first, but you can actually leave 
report windows open. This means that a report window may show a profit and 
loss statement from a week ago, for example. If you’ve entered several transac-
tions in the past week, the report data may no longer be correct. When you click 
the Refresh button, QuickBooks knows that it should update the report with the 
most recent changes.
QuickBooks typically prompts you to update a report for changes to the Quick-
Books data file. If you don’t follow QuickBooks’s suggestion to update, however, 
you can later click Refresh to update.
Using the Report window boxes
The Report window provides five boxes: Dates, From, To, Columns, and Sort By. 
These boxes also enable you to control the information shown in the Report win-
dow and the appearance of the information.

298      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Dates, From, and To
The Dates, From, and To boxes, for example, let you tell QuickBooks what report-
ing interval you want to show in the report. In other words, you use these boxes to 
tell QuickBooks the month, quarter, year, or whatever period for which you want 
to prepare a report.
Columns
The Columns drop-down list displays a set of column choices. By default, Quick-
Books displays a single total column for a report based on the time period you 
select. If you produce a report that summarizes annual income and expense data, 
for example, you can use the Columns drop-down list to tell QuickBooks that 
you want to see monthly columns. In this situation, QuickBooks shows an annual 
income statement, but it also shows columns for January, February, March, and so 
forth, providing some more detail on a certain time period, customer, or vendor. 
To see how this works, take a look at Figure 2-8. The profit and loss statement in 
the window is composed of only a Total column.
Now take a look at Figure 2-9; it shows the same profit and loss statement, except 
this time, the Columns drop-down list shows Customer:Job. In this case, Quick-
Books shows you a breakdown of your income and expenses by Customer and Job, 
FIGURE 2-8:  
A simple 
profit and loss 
statement 
with a single 
Total column.

Preparing Financial 
Statements and Reports
CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      299
as well as the total. The Columns drop-down list gives you a bunch of column 
options. Typically, some options make sense for the report that you’re working 
on; others won’t. Nevertheless, you should occasionally experiment with this tool. 
The Columns drop-down list often gives you a neat way to further segregate and 
refine your data.
Sort By
The Sort By drop-down list enables you to choose how information should be 
ordered in a report. For many types of reports, the Sort By drop-down list doesn’t 
provide any meaningful options. For other types of reports, however, the Sort By 
drop-down list provides handy ways to organize report information.
Modifying a Report
If you click the Customize Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify Report 
dialog box, which you can use to customize a report. When you customize a 
report, you change the report’s appearance, its layout, and the information that 
it summarizes.
FIGURE 2-9:  
A profit and loss 
statement with 
Customer:Job 
columns.

300      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
The Modify Report dialog box looks different for different report types. Neverthe-
less, if you look past the cosmetic differences, all the dialog boxes look and work 
pretty much the same way.
Using the Display tab
The Display tab of the Modify Report dialog box lets you control the report interval 
date, the report basis, the columns, and some other formatting.
The Report Date Range boxes — Dates, From, and To — do the same thing as the 
Dates, From, and To boxes in the Report window. These boxes let you control the 
reporting interval or accounting period. You can choose one of the date descrip-
tions from the Dates drop-down list, or you can use the From and To boxes to 
specify a particular range of dates. The From and To boxes, shown in Figure 2-10, 
accept dates in mm/dd/yyyy format.
The Report Basis option buttons — Accrual and Cash — let you specify whether 
you want QuickBooks to prepare a report on a cash basis or on an accrual basis. 
Now, quite honestly, you can’t simply convert between cash-basis accounting and 
accrual-basis accounting by clicking these buttons. Cash-basis accounting and 
accrual-basis accounting are too complicated for QuickBooks to figure out on its 
own. If you use accrual-basis accounting, for example, you must use the Quick-
Books Accounts Payable feature, and you must record revenue and expense trans-
actions when you earn revenue and incur expenses. Nevertheless, these Report 
Basis buttons enable you to quickly flip between cash-centric profit statements 
and accrual-like financial statements. And that’s pretty handy.
FIGURE 2-10:  
The Display tab of 
the Modify Report 
dialog box for a 
profit and loss 
statement.

Preparing Financial

CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      301
In a nutshell, cash-basis accounting counts income and expense when cash moves 
into and out of a business. Accrual-basis accounting counts income when it’s earned 
and counts expense when it’s incurred. Book 1, Chapter 1 talks in more detail about 
the differences between cash-basis accounting and accrual-basis accounting.
The Columns area enables you to control or specify how many columns a report 
should display. The Display Columns By drop-down list is analogous to the Col-
umns drop-down list in the Report window. The Columns area also lets you 
choose a Sort By option. Again, this is analogous to the Sort By drop-down list in 
the Report window.
In addition, the Columns area allows you to add subcolumns (you do this with the 
Previous Period, Previous Year, and Year-to-Date check boxes) and add percent-
ages. The neat thing about these percentages is that you’re actually adding finan-
cial ratios to your financial statement when you do this. I don’t talk about financial 
ratios in this chapter, but I do go into great detail in Book 5, Chapter 1 about what 
financial ratios are, and about how they can be powerful tools for assessing and 
monitoring your financial condition and your financial performance.
To show each line item of an income statement as a percentage of total income, 
select the % of Income check box.
For more report formatting options, click the Advanced button. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Advanced Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-11. Use the Display 
Rows radio buttons to tell QuickBooks when it should or shouldn’t display rows 
of information in a report. Similarly, use the Display Columns radio buttons to 
tell QuickBooks when it should or shouldn’t display columns in a report. You can 
use the Reporting Calendar radio buttons to select the default annual reporting 
period. The default year can be a fiscal year (you set this option when setting up 
QuickBooks), a calendar year, or an income tax year. Click OK to activate these 
selections.
To revert to the default display settings, click the Revert button on the Display tab 
(refer to Figure 2-10).

dialog box.

302      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Using the Filters tab
The Filters tab is probably the most interesting and useful tab provided by the 
Modify Report dialog box. The Filters tab enables you to set up filters that you 
can use to specify what information gets summarized in the report. To use the 
Filters tab, shown in Figure 2-12, you first select the field on which you want to 
base a filter from the Filter list box. If you want to filter information based on the 
account, for example, select Account in the Filter list box.
After you identify the piece of data on which you want to base your filter, open 
the drop-down list next to the filter. If you selected an account filter, for example, 
QuickBooks names this drop-down list the Account box. When you open the drop-
down list, QuickBooks displays a set of filtering choices. Figure 2-13 shows com-
mon filtering choices available when you’re creating an account filter: All Income/
Expense Accounts, All Ordinary Income/Expense, All Ordinary Income/COGS, and 
so forth. You can pick a standard account filter from this list.
Alternatively, you can pick, for example, the multiple accounts entry from the 
drop-down list. In this case, QuickBooks displays the Select Account dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 2-14. This dialog box lets you select, on an individual basis, which 
accounts you want to appear on the report. If you want to create a report based 
purely on a checking account, an accounts receivable account, and an inventory 
asset account, you use the Select Account dialog box to select these accounts. 
To select the accounts that you want, click them. QuickBooks identifies selected 
accounts with a check mark.
FIGURE 2-12:  
The Filters tab of 
the Modify Report 
dialog box.

Statements and Reports
CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      303
Other fields and boxes on the Filters tab are pretty self-explanatory. The Include 
Split Detail? option buttons, available for account-based filters, let you tell Quick-
Books whether it should include split transaction information. The Current Filter 
Choices list identifies what report filters are used for the report. You can remove 
a filter by selecting it from the Current Filter Choices list and then clicking the 
Remove Selected Filter button. You can also revert to the default filter by clicking 
the Revert button. Note that different boxes appear on the Filters tab for different 
filters.

Account filter.

The Select 
Account dialog 
box.

304      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Using the Header/Footer tab
The Header/Footer tab, shown in Figure 2-15, controls what header and footer 
information appears on your report. You use the Show Header Information check 
boxes to control the report header. If you want your company name to appear at 
the top of the report, for example, select the Company Name check box. And if 
you want to change the company name that appears at the top of the report, edit 
the contents of the Company Name text box. The other Show Header Information 
check boxes work the same way. To remove the report title from the report, dese-
lect the Report Title check box. To use a different report title, edit the contents of 
the Report Title text box.
Use the Page Layout area  — it provides a single Alignment drop-down list  — 
to choose a layout for your report. By default, QuickBooks uses standard align-
ment. You can also choose left alignment, right alignment, or centered alignment. 
QuickBooks shows you how the report layout changes depending on the selected 
alignment.
As is the case with the other tabs of the Modify Report dialog box, you can click the 
Revert button to change back to the default header/footer settings.
Formatting fonts and numbers
The Fonts & Numbers tab, shown in Figure  2-16, lets you change the font for 
selected pieces of report information. Use the Change Font For list box to select 
the bit of report information that you want to change. After this selection, click 
FIGURE 2-15:  
The Header/
Footer tab of the 
Modify Report 
dialog box.

Preparing Financial 
Statements and Reports
CHAPTER 2  Preparing Financial Statements and Reports      305
the Change Font button to display a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 2-17. 
The Column Labels dialog box appears, for example, when you indicate that you 
want to change the font for column labels. Use the Font combo box to select the 
font for the column labels. Use the Font Style combo box to select the font style for 
the column labels. Use the Size combo box to select the point size for the column 
labels. Optionally, use the Effects check boxes to add or remove special effects. Or 
get really crazy and use the Color drop-down list to select the color for the piece 
of report data. When you’re finished, verify that your font formatting choices look 
right by checking the Sample box; then click OK.
When you click OK to close the dialog box used to change a font (refer to  
Figure 2-16), QuickBooks displays a message box, asking whether you want to 
change all the related fonts. If you do want to change the fonts — and you prob-
ably do — click Yes. Note that if you make some change that later turns out to be 
wrong, you can click the Revert button, which also appears on the Fonts & Num-
bers tab, to return to the default formatting for fonts and numbers.
FIGURE 2-16:

Numbers tab of 
the Modify Report 
dialog box.

The Column 
Labels version of 
the Change Font 
dialog box.

306      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
The Show Negative Numbers area (refer to Figure 2-16) provides radio buttons 
and a check box that you can use to instruct QuickBooks to provide special for-
matting for negative values. Typically, QuickBooks shows negative values with a 
minus sign in front of the value. Alternatively, you can tell QuickBooks to place 
parentheses around the negative values (select the In Parentheses radio button) or 
to display them with a trailing minus sign (select the With a Trailing Minus radio 
button). You can also use color to flag negative numbers (select the In Bright Red 
check box).
The Show All Numbers area provides three check boxes that you can use to clean 
up and simplify your report. If your business is large enough that your report val-
ues are very large, select the Divided by 1000 check box. In that case, QuickBooks 
divides all the report values by 1,000 to make them easier to read. If you select the 
Except Zero Amounts check box, QuickBooks simplifies your report by not show-
ing zero values. Finally, if you select the Without Cents check box, QuickBooks 
shows only dollars, not cents.
If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed by the amount of data being pre-
sented in a report, the Show All Numbers check boxes provide a handy way to get 
a somewhat-clearer view of the big picture.
Processing Multiple Reports
If you choose the Reports ➪ Process Multiple Reports command, QuickBooks dis-
plays the Process Multiple Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 2-18. This dialog 
box enables you to request a bunch of previously memorized or commented on 
reports at one time. To use the Process Multiple Reports dialog box, first select a 
report group from the drop-down list. Next, select the reports within the report 
group that you want, and check them off the list. If QuickBooks shows a report as 
selected (indicated with a check mark) that you don’t want, click the check mark 
to remove it. Then, for those reports that you’ve selected, verify that the From and 
To boxes show the correct report interval.
After you’ve selected the reports and provided the report interval dates, you 
can click the Display button to have QuickBooks display the report windows for 
each of the reports that you’ve selected. Alternatively, you can click the Print 
button to have QuickBooks print paper versions of each of the reports that you 
selected.

A Few Words about Document Retention
People sometimes ask me how long they should keep old reports, copies of 
invoices, and other bits of accounting information. Unfortunately, I don’t really 
have a one-size-fits-all answer to these questions. I can give you some things to 
think about, however:
»
» Consider whether the other party to a transaction is ever going to want 
the information. If you’re chronically arguing with a vendor about whether 
you’ve paid some bill, for example, it makes sense to hang on to those vendor 
bills and any records of your payment for as long as the argument may go on. 
This means that any paperwork that documents vendor bills and payments 
doesn’t necessarily have to be retained if you don’t have a problem.
»
» Consider tax accounting requirements. By law (a lot of people don’t realize 
this), a business is required to maintain accounting records to report its 
profits, losses, income, and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service. This 
means that anything that you need to calculate your profits or substantiate 
elements of your calculations should be maintained. A statute of limitations 
exists, however, typically running three years from the date you last filed the 
return. This means that in most cases, you don’t need to keep paperwork 
that’s any older than three years past the return that it relates to. In other 
words, if you have data from the year 2012, and you filed the year 2012 tax 
return on March 15, 2013, by March 16, 2016, you shouldn’t (in most cases) 
need to keep all that old paperwork. The statute of limitations dictates that 
FIGURE 2-18:  
The Process 
Multiple Reports 
dialog box.

308      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
you should be able to discard the old stuff. A word of caution is in order, 
because a handful of exceptions exist to this three-year statute of limitations:
•	 If you’ve been really sloppy and, through your sloppiness, omitted gross 
income in excess of 25 percent of what your return shows, the statute of 
limitations equals six years.
•	 If no return is filed or a fraudulent return is filed, no statute of limitations exists.
•	 States without income taxes (like Washington state, where I live and work) use 
a different set of rules and may use a longer statute of limitations. Washington 
state, for example, says the statute of limitations runs four years, not three.
»
» Consider the old records that you may need in the future to calculate an 
item for your tax return. These records need to be retained. If you bought a 
factory 30 years ago, for example, keep those purchase records until 3 (or 6) 
years after you sell the factory.
»
» Consider that in some industries, other document-retention rules or 
regulations exist. If you’re a physician, you keep your old patient records — 
and this may include patient accounting information — for longer than just 
three years. These other document-retention rules vary by industry. Find out 
what the rules are for your industry.
»
» Consider the risk of retaining confidential information too long. Finally, 
though you might ponder all the forgoing points and conclude that you 
should keep your financial records in perpetuity, note that this approach 
creates risks, too. The more financial documentation you archive, the easier in 
some cases it may be for this information to get lost or stolen. You wouldn’t 
want, for example, to keep so many years’ worth of data that you have to rent 
a warehouse in a bad part of town just to store the stuff.
Summing up, how do you make sense of these vague suggestions? Come up with a 
rough guess as to how long you think you should hang on to stuff. In my business, 
subject to the qualifications listed previously, I hang on to stuff for five years. I’m 
not doing anything criminal or fraudulent or sloppy, so anything that’s over five 
years old, I just toss. By the way, I’m also careful to segregate documents I can throw 
out by year into boxes. I label the boxes with the year number. I also label the boxes 
with a note like “Discard in 2016” just so I know when I can toss that stuff out.
You may want to think twice about simply tossing out financial records. (I’m a 
little anal about this because I’m a CPA.) I actually don’t toss out my personal 
records or, of course, any client records: I shred the documents first. You may 
want to do the same thing.
By the way, some big-box office-supply stores offer in-store shredding services 
at reasonable prices.

CHAPTER 3  Preparing a Budget      309
Preparing a Budget
B
udgets provide business owners and managers powerful tools for bet-
ter managing a firm’s operation. A budget can give the business owner or 
manager a way to more easily and more quantifiably manage the people 
working for the business. A budget can often identify problems or opportunities 
early. Finally, a budget truly gives the owner or manager a way to plan the year’s 
operation, think about what’s most important, and quantify what the firm should 
achieve over the year.
For these reasons, this chapter discusses some practical, common-sense 
approaches to budgeting within QuickBooks. I think you’ll be surprised by how 
straightforward this process is.
Reviewing Common Budgeting Tactics
Before I get into a detailed discussion of how you create a budget and use that 
budget within QuickBooks, I want to briefly identify and describe three very useful 
and common budgeting tactics: top-line budgeting, zero-based budgeting, and 
benchmarking. None of these three tactics is complicated. You probably know of 
and understand at least two of them already. You should consider all these tactics, 
however, as you construct formal or informal budgets for your business.

business

310      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Top-line budgeting
A top-line budget is the simplest budget technique available. A top-line budget 
takes last year’s numbers or last month’s numbers and uses them for this year’s 
budget. If inflation has occurred, of course, a top-line budget may inflate last 
year’s or last month’s numbers by using an inflation factor. Conversely, if the 
business has shrunk a bit or fallen on hard times, the previous year’s or month’s 
numbers may be decreased by some amount.
Although top-line budgeting often receives a bad rap from people who don’t like 
the way it perpetuates the past, top-line budgeting has at least a couple of argu-
ments in its favor:
»
» Top-line budgeting is easy. This is something big in its favor. Other budget-
ing techniques are often much more work.
»
» Top-line budgeting is based on reality. The numbers from last year or last 
month are real. This fact is a unique benefit of top-line budgeting that other 
budgeting tactics (which I describe in the following paragraphs) don’t offer. If 
you know, for example, that last month you spent $2,000 on rent, the reality 
of that true, actual number is a very useful starting point for thinking about 
what you’ll spend this month.
Top-line budgeting, however, possesses a well-known weakness: It tends to per-
petuate previous bad budgeting decisions. If someone long ago decided to spend 
$10,000 on an advertisement in some special industry magazine, for example, 
top-line budgeting may continue to budget that $10,000 annual expense even 
though it no longer makes sense or never made sense.
Zero-based budgeting
Zero-based budgeting is the opposite of top-line budgeting. A zero-based bud-
get works from the bottom up. A zero-based budget starts with individual rev-
enue, expense, asset, liability, and owner’s equity accounts. It examines a specific 
account — postage expense, for example — and then tries to apply common sense 
and logic in coming up with a good postage expense budget amount. The budgeter 
may guess, for example, that the firm will send out 1,000 letters during the year 
and that the average postage per letter will equal 50 cents. In this case, the zero-
based budgeting approach determines that postage expense for the coming year 
will probably equal $500. The zero-based budgeter calculates this amount by tak-
ing 1,000 letters and multiplying this amount by 50 cents postage cost per letter.
The advantage of zero-based budgeting is that it tends to fix poorly figured, pre-
viously budgeted amounts. It doesn’t simply perpetuate bad budgeting decisions 

Preparing a Budget
CHAPTER 3  Preparing a Budget      311
of the past. New budgeted amounts are based on the application of common sense 
and simple arithmetic; the combination of these two items often produces pretty 
good numbers. That’s really cool.
Another neat feature of zero-based budgeting is that it makes people who benefit 
from or use some budgeted amount responsible for that budgeted amount. If some 
manager spent $50,000 on travel expense last year, top-line budgeting states that 
she gets to spend $50,000 this year. Zero-line budgeting, by contrast, makes the 
manager prove through the application of common sense and simple arithmetic 
that $50,000 of travel expense is reasonable for this year.
Zero-based budgeting isn’t perfect, however; it possesses a weakness in that 
it’s easy for budgeters to forget numbers or make calculation errors. Previously, 
I used the example of a budgeter guessing that postage expense for the coming 
year will be $500. That estimate comes from a guess about the number of letters 
sent in a year (1,000) and an estimate of the average postage expense for each 
letter (50 cents). If either of those numbers is wrong, or if (heaven forbid) the 
budgeter incorrectly multiplies one number by the other, the postage expense 
budget number is wrong. If the budgeter is budgeting hundreds or even thousands 
of budgeted amounts, she’ll undoubtedly make a few errors in the process. And 
she probably won’t be able to fix or find those errors because of the volume of 
budgeted amounts.
Benchmarking
One very powerful but unfortunately infrequently used technique is benchmark-
ing. Benchmarking compares your actual or your preliminary budgeted numbers 
with the same numbers of similar-size businesses in your industry. CPA firms 
spend money on a tax library, for example. Annual fees for a tax library can run 
from as little as $100 or $200 a year to more than $10,000 a year. (These amounts 
are fees for a sole proprietor, by the way.) How do you know what number is an 
appropriate budgeted amount? Well, if you know what other CPA firms or other 
sole-proprietor CPAs are spending on their tax libraries, that information can 
probably help you budget what you should or can spend. The challenge, of course, 
is getting that comparable information.
Fortunately, getting comparable information is easier than most people realize. You 
can get information about the financial statistics of comparable firms in two ways:
»
» Your local library: Usually, you can find several good sources of general 
financial statistical information about businesses of varying sizes and in 
varying industries. Dun & Bradstreet, the Risk Management Association, 
Robert Morris & Associates, and a fellow named Leo Troy all publish annual 
summaries of financial ratios and financial statistics based on several sources. 

312      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
If you trot down to the library and visit the reference desk, you can get the 
librarian’s help in locating one or more of these reference sources. Suddenly, 
you have a wealth of information at your fingertips. You can see how much 
the average tavern spends on beer and peanuts, for example. You can see 
how much the average restaurant spends on advertising. In other words, you 
can see detailed financial information on a business exactly like yours!
»
» Industry associations: In addition to the general information available from 
reference sources commonly stocked at your local library, many industry 
associations and professional groups collect and publish industry-specific 
financial information. One of the first jobs I had early in my career was 
working as the controller of an electronics manufacturing firm. Our firm was a 
member of the American Electronics Association. That membership meant 
that we participated in a survey of financial information of member firms in 
the association. That survey gave us (and other AEA members) good statistics 
about average salaries spent for different positions, inventory investment, 
certain administrative expenses, and so forth.
Continuing with my example of CPAs buying tax libraries, I should mention that 
two industry associations — the Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants 
and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants — publish statistics for 
CPA firms. These publications identify what the average sole proprietor spends 
on his tax library. I’ll bet you a dill pickle that your industry association — whatever 
it is — has similar information available. (One other thing about the CPA’s 
­benchmarking studies: They’re online and dynamic, so people benchmarking can 
compare their practice against similar-size firms.)
Putting it all together
Just for the record — and you’ve probably already guessed this — you shouldn’t 
use just one approach to build your budget. You may use top-line budgeting for 
some of your numbers, and you may use zero-based budgeting for other numbers. 
For really important or key numbers in your budget, you may take the time and 
effort to benchmark your numbers against those of similar-size firms in your 
industry. Good budgeting, then, combines the budgeting tactics described in this 
chapter to come up with a budget that makes sense and lets you plan your firm’s 
finances for the year.
Taking a Practical Approach to Budgeting
Business budgeting, unfortunately, isn’t simply a matter of listing expected reve-
nue and expense amounts. Typically, you also create a balance sheet. Balance-sheet 

Preparing a Budget
CHAPTER 3  Preparing a Budget      313
budgeting is too complicated to do on the back of a napkin or at the breakfast table 
in the morning before the kids get up.
Therefore, to create budgeted numbers for a balance sheet, you use a tool and an 
approach like the one described (in some detail) in Book 6, Chapter 2.
If all that you want to budget are revenue amounts and expense amounts, you can 
do that in a very simple, crude fashion. You can list expected revenue amounts by 
account on the back of a cocktail napkin, for example.
Using the Set Up Budgets Window
After you’ve come up with a budget — presumably by using a tool like the one 
described in Book 6, Chapter 2 and by employing the sorts of budgeting tactics 
described previously in this chapter — you record your budget in QuickBooks.
Creating a new budget
To create a new budget in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Company  ➪ Planning and Budgeting  ➪ Set Up Budgets command.
This opens the Create New Budget dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1, which you 
use to create a new budget. (Bet you wouldn’t have guessed that.)
Note: If you have previously set up a budget, QuickBooks displays the Set Up 
Budgets window rather than the Create New Budget dialog box. If QuickBooks 
displays the Set Up Budgets window, you need to click its Create New Budget 
button to display the Create New Budget dialog box, as discussed in “Working 
with an existing budget” later in this chapter.
FIGURE 3-1:  
The Create 
New Budget 
dialog box.

314      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
2.	 Select the fiscal-year period.
Identify the fiscal year you’re budgeting for. To do that, enter the fiscal year in 
the provided text box, shown in Figure 3-1. If you’re budgeting for fiscal year 
2018, for example, you use those buttons to change the year to 2018.
3.	 Choose whether to create a profit and loss or balance sheet budget.
To create a profit and loss budget, select the Profit and Loss radio button, click 
Next, and proceed to Step 4. To create a balance sheet budget, select the 
Balance Sheet radio button, click Finish, and skip to Step 5.
Note that you use a different approach for profit and loss budgets and balance 
sheet budgets. For profit and loss budgets, you budget the amount of revenue 
or expense expected for the account for the month. For balance-sheet budgets, 
you budget the ending account balance — that’s the ending account balance 
expected for the asset, liability, or owner’s equity account at month’s end.
4.	 In the Additional Profit and Loss Criteria dialog box (see Figure 3-2), 
specify additional profit and loss budget criteria, and click Next.
If you chose to create a profit and loss budget in Step 3, select the Customer:Job 
radio button to further extend your budget to include Job details; select the 
Class radio button to include classes in your budget; or simply select the No 
Additional Criteria radio button.
Note: To budget by class, you must first turn on class tracking. For more 
information about class tracking, refer to Book 2, Chapter 3.
5.	 In the Create New Budget dialog box, choose whether to create the 
budget from scratch or previous data.
To create a budget from scratch and start with a clean slate, select the Create 
Budget from Scratch radio button, shown in Figure 3-3. To create a budget 
based on your actual data from last year, select the Create Budget from 
Previous Year’s Actual Data radio button.

6.	 Click Finish when you’re done.
QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window (see Figure 3-4).
Working with an existing budget
To edit an existing budget in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Company  ➪ Planning & Budgeting  ➪ Set Up Budgets command.
QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window — the same one shown in 
Figure 3-4. You use this window to record the amount that you expect for each 
FIGURE 3-3:

whether to 
create a budget 
from scratch.
FIGURE 3-4:

window.

316      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
revenue and expense for each month during the year in which you’re 
­budgeting.
2.	 Select a budget, or create a new one.
Select the budget you want to work with from the Budget drop-down list at the 
top of the window. To create a new budget (you can have as many budgets as 
you want), click the Create New Budget button. For help with creating a new 
budget, see the preceding section.
3.	 (Optional) Choose a customer.
You typically budget by account. If you want to budget in finer detail by also 
estimating amounts for customers, jobs, or classes, you can use the Current 
Customer:Job drop-down list to identify specific customers from whom you 
expect revenue or for whom you expend costs. Note: The Customer:Job 
drop-down list box doesn’t appear unless, when you created the budget you’re 
now working with, you indicated that you wanted to budget by customer.
4.	 Record the budgeted amounts for each month of the fiscal year.
Type the amounts you want to budget for each account in the appropriate 
month columns. Again, remember that revenue and expense accounts are 
budgeted as the amount expected for the month. Asset, liability, and owner’s 
equity amounts are budgeted as the ending account balance expected for the 
month.
To copy the budgeted amount for one month into the text boxes for the 
succeeding months, click the Copy Across button.
5.	 (Optional) Adjust row amounts.
If you find that the yearly total for an account isn’t what you want it to be, you 
can go back and change the amounts for each month so that they add up to 
the correct total, or you can click the Adjust Row Amounts button. Clicking this 
button displays the Adjust Row Amounts dialog box, shown in Figure 3-5. Use 
the Start At drop-down list to select the month you want to start with (either 
the first month or the currently selected month). Then choose whether you 
want to increase or decrease the amounts budgeted, and by how much (by 
entering either a dollar amount or a percentage). Click OK when you finish; 
QuickBooks closes the dialog box.
6.	 Repeat as necessary.
Repeat Steps 3 through 5 for each of the accounts for which you want to 
record budgeted amounts.
Yes, I know, this is a lot of work. Just so you know, in large companies with hun-
dreds or thousands of employees, two or three people spend much of or even all of 
their year working with the budgeted data.

CHAPTER 3  Preparing a Budget      317
Managing with a Budget
After you record your budget in QuickBooks (as described in the earlier section 
“Using the Set Up Budgets Window”), you can compare your actual financial results 
with budgeted amounts by choosing commands from the Budgets & ­Forecasts 
submenu that QuickBooks displays. When you choose the Reports  ➪ Budgets & 
Forecasts command, QuickBooks provides several budgeting reports, described in 
the following list:
»
» Budget Overview: This report summarizes your budgeted amounts. You can 
use it to look at and error-check your budget.
»
» Budget vs. Actual: This report lets you compare budgeted income statement 
information with actual income statement information. The report, therefore, 
lets you compare your expected revenue and expenses with actual revenue 
and expenses.
»
» Profit & Loss Budget Performance: This report lets you compare your actual 
income, expenses, and profits with your budgeted income, expenses, and profits.
»
» Budget vs. Actual Graph: This graph isn’t a report. It’s a chart that shows 
budgeted and actual information.
»
» Forecast Overview: This report summarizes a QuickBooks forecast. A forecast 
is basically a prediction about your future revenue and cash flow. You use 
forecasts to do “what if” planning.
»
» Forecast vs. Actual: This report compares a forecast with what actually happened.
The way that you use a budgeting report’s information is key  — and also the 
secret to getting value from your budgeting efforts. With a well-constructed, 
common-sense budget, you can look for variances between your budget and your 
actual financial results. You want to use your budget to spot situations in which, 
for example, an expense item is too low, an asset item is too high, or some rev-
enue number is trailing what you expect. Variances between expected results 
and actual results indicate unexpected results. Unexpected results often suggest 
FIGURE 3-5:  
The Adjust 
Row Amounts 
dialog box.

318      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
problems . . . or opportunities. Think about the following examples of variance and 
what the variances may indicate:
»
» Monthly revenue is $40,000 instead of $50,000. Monthly revenue that’s 
20 percent less than expected may indicate problems with your product, 
problems with your sales force, or problems with your customers. In any case, 
if sales represent only 80 percent of what you expect, you probably need to 
implement immediate corrective action.
»
» Inventory balances are averaging $50,000 at month’s end rather than 
$100,000 at month’s end. Having a lower-than-expected inventory balance 
may be either good or bad. The ending inventory balance that’s half what 
you expect may indicate that you’re selling products much faster than you 
expected (and, therefore, you should increase your inventory investment and 
purchasing of inventory). Having a low inventory investment may also mean, 
however, that you’re simply not getting materials from your vendors as fast as 
you need them, and as a result, you’re at great risk of losing sales because of 
inadequate stock levels.
»
» Research and development expenses equal $50,000 a year instead of 
$25,000 a year. Research and development expenses that are twice what you 
expect seem to be bad. How can it be good to spend twice as much on an 
expense as you expect? Doubling your research and development expendi-
tures may be good, however, if you’re unexpectedly investing in some 
promising new product, idea, or technology.
»
» Sales to a particular class of customer are 50 percent higher. Suppose that 
you used classes to track sales to customers inside the country and outside the 
country. If you see that, quite unexpectedly, sales to customers outside the 
country are 50 percent above what you expect, that variance may indicate an 
opportunity to sell even more outside the country. Maybe with more effort and 
energy, outside-the-country customers can become an even larger part of your 
business. Sometimes, variances identify opportunities that you’d otherwise miss.
Some Wrap-Up Comments on Budgeting
Before I leave the subject of budgeting, I want to share a handful of final comments:
»
» Budgeting is an example of the old phrase “Plan your work and then 
work your plan.” Budgets aren’t handcuffs. Budgets aren’t straitjackets. 
Budgets are simply planning tools that you use to thoughtfully make decisions 
about your firm’s financial affairs for the coming year.

Preparing a Budget
CHAPTER 3  Preparing a Budget      319
»
» If you aren’t getting value from the budgeting process, you shouldn’t 
do it. Or, at the very least, you should change the way you’re doing it. No 
kidding — I won’t argue that you should budget if you don’t get value from 
the process. I think, however, that most businesses do get value. If you can 
manage your business without a budget — and I mention an approach that 
works for doing this in a tip at the end of this chapter — I don’t think you 
should budget. You use those tools that deliver the most value to you in 
managing your firm. For many people, budgeting does just that. If it doesn’t 
for you, skip the work. Time is often the scarcest resource for business owners 
and managers.
»
» Budgets can be essential tools for managing people with financially 
quantifiable responsibilities. Okay, I know budgets have a bad rap, and they 
aren’t perfect, but you know what? If you have people working for you who 
have responsibilities that you can financially quantify, you can use a budget to 
manage those people. Suppose that you have salespeople who should 
individually sell $25,000 worth of stuff each month. If you budget by salesper-
son (you probably need to set up a class for each salesperson or a revenue 
account for each salesperson), you can use a budget to compare actual sales 
generated by each person with the budgeted sales expected for him. If you 
look at Joe every month and see that he has $30,000 in sales predictably, you 
can use that information in your management of Joe. Probably, Joe’s overpro-
ducing means that he’s doing a good job. If you look at Joe’s brother Bob and 
see that he’s doing $20,000 in sales every month when you expect him to do 
$25,000 in sales, you can probably see a problem and an opportunity for 
improvement. All this makes sense, right?
»
» People who like to budget tend to (in my experience) focus on unfavor-
able variances. I mention this because although unfavorable variances often 
identify problems that need to be corrected, favorable variances sometimes 
are more interesting and more useful to dissect. Suppose that you have a 
business in which you expect salespeople to generate $25,000 in sales a 
month. If Julia is generating $75,000 a month in sales, that’s pretty darn 
interesting. Julia probably knows something or has skills or an approach that 
the other salespeople don’t have. Perhaps, with just a little bit of luck, you can 
figure out why Julia does so well — and then use this new knowledge to get 
your other salespeople to sell more stuff each month.
»
» The key budgeting numbers to watch are often a pretty small set. 
Although a budget according to QuickBooks (and, I guess, Steve Nelson) may 
have hundreds of numbers, you may be able to manage your business just 
fine by looking at just a handful of numbers. Maybe in your business, every-
thing comes down to sales. If sales really drive everything else — your 
expenses and, of course, all your profits — you may not have much reason to 
track the amount that you’re spending each month on your telephone bill or 

320      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
postage expense. If you can distill your financial plan down to a few numbers 
that you need to watch, you can make your budgeting and financial analyses 
much simpler. All you do is identify the key financial statistics to watch — and 
then watch them regularly.
Financial ratios are often very useful tools for monitoring a firm’s financial per-
formance. I know several business owners who successfully manage their busi-
nesses without a formal budget by looking at two or three items, including cost of 
goods sold and gross margin percentages. The cost of goods sold includes the cost 
of the products or items being sold. A gross margin percentage is the percentage of 
sales left over after paying for the cost of goods sold. To dig into these terms and 
find out about working with financial ratios, see Book 5, Chapter 1.

CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      321
Using Activity-Based 
Costing
A
ctivity-based costing (ABC for short) may be the best new accounting idea 
in the past three decades. No, I must amend that: Activity-based costing is 
the best new idea in accounting in the past three decades.
ABC gives businesses a better way to estimate the profits of products and services, 
which is more important than you may think. The problem in many businesses 
is that overhead expenses or operating expenses don’t cleanly tie to products or 
services. Without good allocation of overhead or operating expenses, businesses 
can’t accurately determine which products make money and which don’t.
ABC addresses this problem by using the power of the computer (QuickBooks, in 
this example) to directly trace overhead costs to products and services. Surpris-
ingly, ABC accomplishes this task in a pretty straightforward, simple fashion. In 
this chapter, I show you what I mean.

Reviewing Traditional Overhead Allocation
To really understand the contribution that ABC makes, you need to understand 
how overhead allocation traditionally works. To give you an example, take a look 
at Table 4-1. This is the same simple income statement that I show in several 
chapters throughout the book.
As you may recall, this simple income statement shows the profit for an imaginary 
hot-dog-stand business that you operate on the opening day of baseball season 
in your city.
Suppose that in this imaginary business, you sell two products: a regular hot dog 
for $2.50 and a super-duper chili dog for $4.00. Suppose also that you sell 2,000 of 
both of these products. Therefore, the $13,000 of revenue shown in Table 4-1 actu-
ally represents $5,000 in sales of regular hot dogs and $8,000 in sales of chili dogs.
Further suppose that you can break down the cost of goods sold as follows:
»
» Buns: Each bun cost you 15 cents. This means that you spent $300 on buns 
for regular dogs and $300 on buns for the chili dogs.
»
» Dogs: Each hot dog cost you 40 cents. This means that you spent $800 on hot 
dogs for the regular hot dog product line and another $800 on hot dogs for the 
chili dog product line.
»
» Chili: Each serving of chili for the chili dogs cost you 40 cents. (A serving is 
three heaping tablespoons of chili, as you enjoy telling customers.) This means 
that you spent another $800 on chili for the chili dog product line.

Given this information, you can create an income statement that shows revenue, 
cost of goods sold, and gross margin by product line, as shown in Table 4-2. Fur-
thermore, note that Table 4-2 does something very traditional: It allocates oper-
ating expenses by using a simple rule. In Table 4-2, I’ve simply split the operating 
expenses right down the middle, allocating $3,000 of operating expenses to the 
regular hot dog product line and $3,000 of operating expenses to the chili dog 
product line.
Stop for a minute and look at the information shown in Table  4-2. When you 
consider and make decisions based on this information, it becomes much easier to 
understand traditional overhead allocations.
If you examine the income statement shown in Table 4-2, several pieces of data 
suggest that there’s money in them there chili dogs. Look at the sales revenue, 
for example. The income statement shows that chili dogs generate $8,000 of sales 
revenue, whereas regular hot dogs generate only $5,000 of sales revenue. Now 
look at the gross margin. The income statement shows that chili dogs generate 
$6,100 of gross margin, whereas regular hot dogs generate only $3,900 of gross

margin. Finally, look at the net profit. Based on a simple split of overhead or oper-
ating expenses, the net profit from the regular hot dog line equals a measly $900, 
whereas the net profit from the chili dog product line equals a whopping $3,100.
After reviewing the information shown in Table 4-2, what is your conclusion? It 
seems pretty clear that you should sell more chili dogs and fewer hot dogs. In fact, 
you may want to give up on selling regular hot dogs and concentrate on chili dogs. 
You may also decide that your chili dogs are priced too high; perhaps you could 
shave the cost a bit on these. You may further decide that the regular hot dogs are 
priced too low; perhaps the price of these should be bumped up a bit.
Indeed, you can make all sorts of decisions from the collective set of data shown 
in Table 4-2. You may not realize that the overhead allocation plays an important 
part in all of this. Unfortunately, the overhead allocation shown in Table 4-2 and 
any of the conclusions I suggest in the preceding paragraphs are wrong. This 
error, however, doesn’t show up until you use activity-based costing, and that’s 
why ABC is cool.
Understanding How ABC Works
In this section, I tell you how, with ABC, you can create an equivalent income 
statement for product-line profitability. After that, I generalize about the ABC 
process and define the buzzwords that people usually use to talk about ABC.
The ABC product-line income statement
To create an ABC product-line income statement, you attempt to trace the over-
head cost directly to products or services. Suppose that in the case of the imagi-
nary hot-dog-stand business, the rent expense is necessary because you need an 
electrical hookup to keep the pot of chili heated. Perhaps you also need an electri-
cal hookup to run the can opener that you use (surreptitiously) to open the cans 
of chili needed to refill the pot. This means, then, that the rent expense really 
can’t be split between regular hot dogs and chili dogs. It needs to be allocated to 
chili dogs.
You can treat the supplies expense in a very similar way. Suppose that the $1,000 
of supplies is really just napkins. Also suppose that based on your observations, 
a regular hot dog customer grabs two napkins for his hot dog, whereas a chili 
dog customer grabs eight napkins for his chili dog (you know, to clean up the 
mess on the front of his shirt when the chili spills). In this case, you can use this 

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      325
information to better allocate the $1,000 of supplies expense. Consider that this 
information means that regular hot dog customers use roughly 4,000 napkins. 
(I calculated this by multiplying the 2,000 hot dogs you’ve sold by the 2 napkins 
used for each regular hot dog customer.) And chili dog customers use 16,000 nap-
kins. (I calculated this by multiplying the 2,000 chili dogs that you’ve sold by the 
8 napkins used by each chili dog customer.)
Using this napkin-use information, you can calculate which percentage of the 
supplies expense is used by regular hot dog customers and which percentage is 
used by chili dog customers. If regular hot dog customers use 4,000 of a total 
20,000 napkins, 20 percent of the napkins are going to regular hot dog customers 
(20 percent of the $1,000 of supplies expense equals $200). Therefore, the correct 
allocation of supplies expense to the regular hot dog line is $200.
You can allocate a portion of the supplies expense for chili dogs by using similar 
math. If 16,000 of the 20,000 napkins go to chili dog customers, that’s 80 per-
cent of the napkins (80 percent of the $1,000 of supplies expense equals $800). 
Therefore, logically, $800 out of $1,000 of supplies expense should be allocated, 
or traced, to the chili dog product line.
All this makes sense, right? All you’re trying to do is trace overhead costs, or 
­operating expenses, to product lines.
The wages expense of $4,000 probably works in a very similar fashion. Before 
going further, though, I have to delve into some of the ABC buzzwords. Suppose 
that all the $4,000 of wages expense goes to serving customers hot dogs. Further-
more, suppose that the process of serving a regular hot dog to a customer requires 
two steps:
1.	 Grab a hot dog bun.
2.	 Slide a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
By comparison, the process of serving a chili dog requires five steps:
1.	 Grab a hot dog bun.
2.	 Slide a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
3.	 Ladle a heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
4.	 Ladle another heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
5.	 Ladle a third heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun (yes, you read that 
correctly).

326      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
You may see where I’m going with this. I’ve actually done something very 
­special  — something that business-school professors would dress up with a 
bunch of fancy words in academic business journals. In this example, I state that 
the wages expense actually gets used in an activity called serving or serving custom-
ers. I also note in this example that the process of serving a regular hot dog cus-
tomer requires two steps, but the process of serving a chili dog customer actually 
requires five steps.
These steps are known as cost drivers. That sounds like something you may not 
understand right away, but in fact, the notion of cost drivers is simple common 
sense. The term cost drivers simply suggests that the number of steps an employee 
takes to serve a customer is a good base on which to allocate the wages expense 
that comprises the activity of serving.
You may have already guessed how to do this, but I’ll tell you anyway: By look-
ing at the total number of steps required to serve regular hot dogs and the total 
number of steps required to serve chili dogs, you can trace the wages expense to 
the regular hot dog and chili dog product lines.
If you sell 2,000 regular hot dogs, and each hot dog requires 2 steps, regular hot 
dogs require 4,000 steps in total. If you sell 2,000 chili dogs, and each chili dog 
requires 5 steps, the chili dog product line requires 10,000 steps.
You can use these two values — the number of steps for the regular hot dog line 
and the number of steps for the chili dog line — to allocate the wages expense. To 
calculate the percentage of the wages expense that goes into preparing regular hot 
dogs, you make the following calculation:
4,000 (steps for regular hot dogs) / 14,000 (total steps) × $4,000
This calculation returns the value $1,143.
In a similar fashion, you can use the steps information to allocate wages expense 
to the chili dog product line. Here’s how that calculation may work:
10,000 (steps for chili dogs) / 14,000 (total steps) × $4,000
This calculation returns the value $2,857.
Now take a look at Table 4-3, which summarizes all this ABC analysis that I’ve 
discussed over the past few paragraphs. The most noteworthy item — and the 
first item to observe about ABC analysis — is that an ABC approach to product-
line profitability often produces surprising results.

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      327
If you think back to the impressions you had after looking at the income ­statement 
shown in Table 4-2, you may have concluded that chili dogs are really a much bet-
ter product to sell. As Table 4-3 shows when you look at the net profit number, 
however, regular hot dogs make twice as much profit as chili dogs — even though 
they sell for less money and even though they produce much less gross margin. 
Only a fair and accurate tracing of overhead expenses shows this fact. Wow. Pass 
the mustard.
All this is pretty neat, isn’t it? If you step away from your imaginary hot-dog-stand 
business and look at your real business, you may find yourself asking new and 
awkward questions, such as “That product generates all that revenue? Maybe a 
fair accounting of overhead would show it actually loses money. . . .” Remember 
that cheapo product or cheapo service that you never spend much money on — 
you know the one — and that doesn’t generate much gross margin? Well, you may 
be making a lot more money on it than you thought. Scary, isn’t it?

ABC in a small firm
I want to make three important observations about ABC in a small firm. Some of 
this stuff is obvious, and some of it is redundant, but I think it’s important enough 
for you hear it at least one more time:
»
» ABC is most useful when you have lots of overhead and a bunch of 
products. In any environment that doesn’t have a lot of overhead, ABC isn’t 
worth the work and won’t deliver insights. Likewise, ABC doesn’t make sense 
in any business that sells a single product or that provides a single service, 
which may be the case in a small firm. (Keep reading, though, because 
analysis of cost drivers can provide one unique insight.)
»
» ABC may not make sense for custom manufacturing environments. In a 
custom manufacturing environment — this is any business in which you make 
specific things for specific customers — you can often use job costing to 
provide good product or service profitability measures. In the case of a 
single-family-home builder, for example, the builder can use job costing to 
track revenue and expenses by job (single-family home), and that job costing 
may provide the detailed profitability-by-product-line information that’s the 
big benefit of ABC.
ABC is first and foremost a tool for better allocating overhead costs.
»
» Cost drivers “drive” costs. In the discussion of the hot-dog-stand business 
and the activity labeled serving a customer, the serving steps are the cost 
drivers. The number of steps required to serve a customer drive the costs  
of serving the customer. That may sound really dumb, but sometimes, one of 
the benefits that ABC provides is an insight into how changing the number of 
cost drivers changes your costs. Suppose that instead of spooning three 
heaping tablespoons of chili onto a chili dog, you purchase one spoon 
equivalent to three tablespoons; this would change the number of steps from 
five to three. Recall the original, five-step approach to serving the chili dog 
customer:
1.	 Grab a hot dog bun.
2.	 Slide a hot-off-the-grill frankfurter into the bun.
3.	 Ladle a heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
4.	 Ladle another heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
5.	 Ladle a third heaping tablespoon of chili into the bun.
This sounds so obvious as to be unworthy of inclusion in this book. But if you 
get a three-tablespoon spoon, you can simplify the serving of a chili dog into 
three steps:

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      329
1.	 Grab a bun.
2.	 Slide a hot dog into the bun.
3.	 Heap a three-tablespoon serving of chili into the bun.
Changing the number of steps required to serve a customer a chili dog 
changes the cost of the serving activity for a chili dog. And changing the cost of 
serving a chili dog changes the profitability (potentially) of serving a chili dog. 
I say “potentially” because you may not actually be able to reduce your wages 
expense by buying a three-tablespoon spoon for lathering up your chili dogs 
with chili, but you get the idea. Note: To really save money by reducing the 
number of steps, you need to be able to cut your wages expense.
The bottom line concerning ABC is this: ABC lets you better allocate overhead 
costs, and as a bonus, ABC often gives you unique insights into what drives your 
overhead costs. With this information in hand, you can make better decisions 
about your product and service lines, and sometimes, you can even change your 
business operations in a way that reduces your costs.
Implementing a Simple ABC System
I’ll admit this right up front: You can make ABC very complicated. Further-
more, if you go out and hire an outside consultant — somebody who wants to 
charge you thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to set up one of these 
­systems — you may end up with something that is very, very powerful and very, 
very complicated.
That being said, however, ABC systems don’t have to be that complicated, particu-
larly if you just want better allocation of your overhead costs rather than a system 
to look at the cost drivers or the activities that comprise your overhead costs. ABC 
can be pretty straightforward. This is especially true in a small or medium-size 
firm. In fact, I think you can probably implement a good, first-rate ABC system by 
taking the following four steps:
1.	 Look at your overhead costs.
Verify that you have enough overhead to be worrying about. If you’re in a 
business with big fat margins and very low overhead, ABC may not make any 
sense for you. The incremental value that you achieve by allocating overhead 
more precisely may be simply a manifestation of an obsessive-compulsive 
personality disorder rather than good accounting.

330      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
2.	 Identify the big overhead cost.
You must do this if you decide that you want to allocate some or a bunch of 
your overhead via an ABC approach. Don’t spend time trying to accurately 
allocate some penny-ante amounts (unless they’re simple-to-allocate ones that 
can be done at the same time as the bigger project). Go for the biggest bang 
you can get for your buck. Create an ABC system that allocates, with a minimal 
amount of effort, a large chunk of your overhead. Don’t get too pedantic.
3.	 Identify the principal activities that use up the overhead costs.
In the simple example of the imaginary hot-dog-stand business, you have only 
a single activity: serving a customer. You’re certainly going to have more 
activities than that. But you don’t need to create a list of 80 activities. Identify 
the big activities that enable you to allocate your overhead. The fewer the 
activities you can use to do this, the easier your accounting will be. Find a 
handful of activities that let you fairly and accurately allocate overhead to 
product lines. That’s the big picture.
4.	 Trace the activities to products by using the appropriate measures.
After you’ve identified the handful of activities that let you connect overhead 
expenses to products, be sure to use the appropriate measure — also 
known as a cost driver — to tie the overhead expenses to the product lines 
or service lines.
In the example of the hot-dog-stand business, one overhead cost — rent — 
didn’t even need a cost driver. The supplies expense also didn’t need a cost 
driver because you were able to allocate that cost through simple observation. 
The wages expense required a more sophisticated textbook approach to 
allocation. To allocate the wages expense, you created an activity called serving 
the customer and then allocated that activity’s cost based on the number of 
steps that each product line required.
An ABC system is a tool that you can use to manage your overhead costs and the 
profitability of the products or services that you sell. Practically, you want to focus 
on the big overhead costs, and in the end, all you really want is an ABC system 
that produces useful numbers — numbers that help you think about your business 
more clearly and creatively.
Seeing How QuickBooks Supports ABC
Okay, you’re probably saying to yourself, “Steve, all this sounds pretty good. But 
you’re a little short on specifics and a little long on theory. Where’s the beef, 
buddy?”

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      331
Oh, that’s right. I do need to tell you how an ABC system works in QuickBooks, 
don’t I? No problem — the approach is actually really straightforward if you’ve 
already been using QuickBooks. In short, all you do to implement a simple ABC 
system in QuickBooks is what you’re doing right now. In other words, just keep 
on tracking your operating expenses by using a good, decent chart of accounts. 
That’s 90 percent of the battle.
You also need to take care of just one or two minor, additional items. First, you 
turn on the QuickBooks Class Tracking feature. Class Tracking lets you catego-
rize income and expense transactions as falling not just into income and expense 
accounts, but also into particular classes.
Second, when you record an expense, you also identify the class into which the 
expense falls. Using classes that correspond to your activities — well, you can see 
that’s all it takes, right?
Turning On Class Tracking
To turn on Class Tracking in QuickBooks, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Edit  ➪  Preferences.
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box.
2.	 Tell QuickBooks you want to work with the accounting preferences.
To tell QuickBooks that you want to change one of its accounting preferences —  
Class Tracking, in this case — click the Accounting icon, which appears in the list 
box along the left edge of the Preferences dialog box. Figure 4-1 shows the 
Company Preferences tab for the accounting preferences. (If the Company 
Preferences tab doesn’t appear on your screen, simply click the tab name.)
3.	 Select the Use Class Tracking for Transactions check box to turn on Class 
Tracking.
4.	 You may as well also select the Prompt to Assign Classes box so that 
QuickBooks reminds you to use the classes.
5.	 Click OK.
From this point forward, QuickBooks adds a Class drop-down list or field to the 
windows that you use to record revenues and expenses (such as the Create 
Invoices window, the Write Checks window, the Enter Bills window, and so on). 
All you do is tag transactions as they fit into a particular class.

332      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Using Classes for ABC
After you turn on Class Tracking, using classes is really straightforward. You set 
up classes for the product lines or service lines for which you want to measure 
profitability. You classify transactions as fitting into a particular class either as 
they’re recorded (if you can) or after the fact (if you need to fiddle with the activity 
and cost driver math).
Setting up your classes
You set up a class for each product or service for which you want to measure prof-
itability. In the imaginary hot-dog-stand business, for example, you set up two 
classes: one for regular hot dogs and one for chili dogs.
To set up a class, you can just enter the class name in the class box that appears 
in the window that you use to record invoices, write checks, and make journal 
entries. (These windows are shown later in this section.) Alternatively, you can 
choose Lists  ➪  Class List. When QuickBooks displays the Class List window, click 
the Class button shown at the bottom of the window, and choose New from the 
menu that QuickBooks displays. Use the New Class window that appears, as shown 
in Figure 4-2, to describe the new class.

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      333
Classifying revenue amounts
To classify revenue as fitting into a particular class, use the Class box that appears 
in the Create Invoices window and in the Enter Sales Receipt window. (These are 
the two windows that you use to record sales.) If an invoice records sales of a 
hot dog, for example, you may record the class as Regular Dog. If a sales receipt 
records sales of a chili dog, you may record the class as Chili Dog. Figure  4-3 
shows the Create Invoices window filled out to record the day’s chili dog sales.
The Class drop-down list is near the top of the window, next to the Customer:Job 
drop-down list.
FIGURE 4-2:  
The New Class 
window.
FIGURE 4-3:  
The Create 
Invoices window.

334      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Classifying expense amounts
To record a check that pays some expense that fits into a particular activity, 
you also use the Class column  — this appears on the Expenses tab, shown in 
Figure 4-4 — to identify the product line or service into which the expense fits. 
Figure 4-4 shows how the Write Checks window may appear to record $1,000 of 
rent expense allocated to the chili dog product line.
The Class column is located along the right edge of the Expenses tab.
After-the-fact classifications
In some cases, you won’t be able to classify an expense or revenue amount at the 
time the initial transaction is recorded. In the hot-dog-stand example, you prob-
ably won’t be able to figure out how to split the wages expense between regular 
hot dogs and chili dogs until after you pay the employees. The same thing is true 
of the supplies expense. In both cases, you need to know how many regular hot 
dogs and how many chili dogs you sold before you can allocate, or trace, supplies 
and wages.
FIGURE 4-4:  
The Write Checks 
window.

Using Activity-Based 
Costing
CHAPTER 4  Using Activity-Based Costing      335
In these sorts of cases, you use the Make General Journal Entries window to clas-
sify previously unclassified expenses. Figure 4-5 shows you how to take $4,000 of 
previously unclassified wages expense and allocate the amount to the regular and 
chili dog product lines.
The Class column is located along the right edge of the Make General Journal 
Entries window.
Producing ABC reports
After you allocate as much overhead as you can to the product or service lines, you 
can prepare a profit and loss statement by class that shows the profitability-by- 
product-line data. Book 4, Chapter 2 explains and discusses QuickBooks reports. 
Note that if you used the example data discussed in this chapter, you could pro-
duce a QuickBooks report that looks almost identical to the income statement 
shown in Table 4-3, earlier in this chapter.
To produce a profit and loss statement by class, choose the Reports  ➪  Company & 
Financial  ➪  Profit & Loss by Class command.

M
any businesses work on projects or jobs. One way to look at a home 
builder’s business, for example, is as a series of home construction proj-
ects. A manufacturer, such as a commercial printer, may print books, 
brochures, or posters for its customers. Each of those items represents jobs that 
are performed for specific customers.
Accounting may work a bit differently when a firm organizes its work into proj-
ects or jobs. In some situations, a firm needs to track revenues and expenses — 
not just by a standard chart of accounts, but also by jobs or projects. Fortunately, 
QuickBooks makes job costing, or project costing, pretty darn easy. In this ­chapter, 
I talk about the tools that QuickBooks provides.

Setting Up a QuickBooks Job
To set up a QuickBooks job, choose the Customers  ➪  Customer Center command. 
QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window, shown in Figure 5-1.
To set up a job for a particular customer, right-click the customer and choose the 
Add Job menu command from the shortcut menu. When you do so, QuickBooks 
displays the New Job window, shown in Figure 5-2.
To set up a job for a customer, use the Job Name box to give the job or project a 
name. A home builder, for example, may use the address of the home as the job. 
(Perhaps just the street address would suffice.)
Optionally, you can use the Address Info, Additional Info, Payment Settings 
(shown in Figure 5-3), and Job Info tabs to provide additional information about 
the job. Figure 5-4 shows the Job Info tab of the New Job window. This tab pro-
vides drop-down lists that you can use to identify the job status and the job type. 
The tab also provides text boxes that you can use to enter the job start date, pro-
jected end date, and actual end date. If a job is inactive, and you no longer want 
it to appear in the Customer Center window’s list, you can also select the Job Is 
Inactive check box.

340      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
And that, my friend, is that. Essentially, all you do to begin tracking jobs is add 
jobs to the QuickBooks Customer:Job list. Sweet, right?
Tracking Job or Project Costs
After you set up a job in the Customer:Job list, you track the income and expenses 
associated with the job. To do this, you enter the customer and job name (rather 
than just the customer) in the Customer:Job text box. If you take a quick look 
at Figure 5-5, for example, you see the Create Invoices window. (I go into more 
detail about the Create Invoices window in Book 3, Chapter  1.) Note that the 
Customer:Job drop-down list can show both the customer and job name. If an 
invoice is associated with a particular job, you want to identify both the customer 
and the job by using the Customer:Job list. And that’s really all it takes.
Other windows that you use to record income and expenses also provide 
Customer:Job drop-down lists. If you look at the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog 
box, shown in Figure 5-6, you can see that QuickBooks supplies the Customer:Job 
drop-down list for recording the time that you’ve worked on a particular cus-
tomer’s project or job. (Book 3, Chapter 1 also talks about billing for time.) Again, 
FIGURE 5-4:  
The Job Info 
tab of the New 
Job window.

Setting Up Project and 
Job Costing Systems
CHAPTER 5  Setting Up Project and Job Costing Systems      341
all you do to track the time associated with a particular job is identify both the 
customer and the job by using the Customer:Job drop-down list.
Next time you invoice this client, a pop-up prompts you to choose whether you 
want to include any outstanding billable time and costs to the invoice.
FIGURE 5-5:  
The Create 
Invoices window.
FIGURE 5-6:  
The Time/Enter 
Single Activity 
dialog box.

342      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Just because I have a compulsive personality, I need to point out one more example  
of the Customer:Job drop-down list. If you take a look at the Write Checks ­window, 
shown in Figure 5-7, you see that one of the columns shown on the Expenses tab 
is the Customer:Job column. This column lets you tag any expense amount as 
being associated with a particular customer’s job. All you do is identify both the 
customer and the job by using the Customer:Job column. You won’t be surprised 
to hear that if you happen to click the Items tab, it also supplies a Customer:Job 
column.
ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL JOB COSTING
Because QuickBooks’s job costing approach may not work for everybody — and may 
even be more than some users need — let me point out that you can do some simple 
job costing or project costing without using the Customer:Job drop-down list. Here are 
two options:
•	 You can use classes to segregate costs. Classes work as a very reasonable way  
to track income and expense transactions for particular jobs if they’re associated.  
I think that the traditional Customer:Job drop-down list provides a more convenient 
way to do this. But if you have your heart set on it, you can also use the Class drop-
down list. The Class drop-down list or Class column typically appears next to the 
Customer:Job drop-down list or the Customer:Job column. You work with the Class 
drop-down list the same way that you work with the Customer:Job drop-down list. 
Note that the Class drop-down list or column appears only if you enable class track-
ing by using the Preferences dialog box.
•	 You can also construct a very detailed chart of accounts, including accounts, 
subaccounts, and sub-subaccounts. With a very detailed chart of accounts, you 
can use collections of accounts to track expenses that are associated with particular 
projects or jobs. If jobs take a very long time to complete, and you’re working on 
only a few jobs, for example, the chart-of-accounts approach works just fine.
If you use an alternative job costing approach with QuickBooks, unfortunately, you won’t 
be able to rely on QuickBooks’s job costing reports. QuickBooks provides (as I discuss 
in the “Job Cost Reporting” section later in this chapter) a bunch of handy job costing 
reports. QuickBooks expects that you’ll use the Customer:Job drop-down list to collect 
job cost information. If you don’t use the Customer:Job drop-down list, make sure that 
you have a good way to track the costs associated with a particular job or customer.
Another problem with both alternative approaches to job costing — classes or lots of 
subaccounts — is that you may later want to use classes and subaccounts in some 
way that’s incompatible with using them for job costing. Jobs are, very frankly, best 
accounted for by using the QuickBooks job feature.

Setting Up Project and 
Job Costing Systems
CHAPTER 5  Setting Up Project and Job Costing Systems      343
To summarize, to track income and expense by job, you must identify not only the 
account that some income transaction or expense transaction falls into, but also 
the customer and job associated with the income or expense transaction. You do 
this by entering the customer name and job name in the Customer:Job text box. 
And that’s all you have to do. Just remember to fill in that box.
Job Cost Reporting
Other chapters in other minibooks of this reference talk about QuickBooks reports. 
Book 4, Chapter 2, for example, talks about how you can easily prepare QuickBooks 
financial statements and reports. Because I’ve already talked about QuickBooks 
reports in some detail, including how you print and customize reports, I don’t 
talk about that stuff here. I do want to point out, however, that if you choose 
the Reports➪  Jobs, Time & Mileage command, QuickBooks displays a submenu of 
almost two dozen reports that supply job costing information. The report titles 
are pretty self-explanatory. Some reports give job profitability, and some reports 
identify the estimates associated with a particular job. Other reports compare job 
estimates with actual job costs. You get the picture.
FIGURE 5-7:  
The Write 
Checks window.

344      BOOK 4  Accounting Chores
Obviously, you want to experiment with these reports if you do begin to use job 
costing. These reports let you slice and dice your job accounting data in a bunch of 
ways. You should be able to use these reports (albeit with some modifications) to 
supply most of the information that you need to make good job costing decisions 
and to manage job costs.
Using Job Estimates
If you’ve told QuickBooks that you want to create estimates — you may have done 
this during QuickBooks setup — you can create job estimates of amounts that you 
later invoice.
To create a job estimate, choose the Customers  ➪  Create Estimates command. 
QuickBooks displays the Create Estimates window, as shown in Figure 5-8. I don’t 
describe how to fill in the fields of this window, because this window mirrors the 
Create Invoices window, which is described in detail in Book 3, Chapter 1. In a 
nutshell, you fill out the Create Estimates window the same way that you fill out 
the Create Invoices window. This makes sense. An estimate is just an example or 
guess of the future invoice for a job. Predictably, you collect and supply the same 
information, and you fill in the fields the same way.
FIGURE 5-8:  
The Create 
Estimates 
window.

Setting Up Project and 
Job Costing Systems
CHAPTER 5  Setting Up Project and Job Costing Systems      345
If you have questions about how to work with a particular field or box in the Create 
Estimates window, refer to Book 3, Chapter 1. Find the description of the related 
field in the Create Invoices window. Whatever you do with that field in the Create 
Invoices window is the same thing that you do in the Create Estimates window.
When you invoice a customer for which you’ve previously prepared an estimate, 
QuickBooks displays a list of the previously prepared estimates and lets you select 
one of these estimates as the starting point for an invoice. (This shortcut can be 
a real time-saver.)
If you didn’t turn on Estimates when you set up QuickBooks, you can do so after the 
fact. Choose the Edit  ➪  Preferences command; click the Jobs & Estimates icon in the 
Preferences dialog box; click the Company Preferences tab, shown in Figure 5-9; 
and then select the Yes radio button below Do You Create Estimates? You may also 
want to select the Yes radio button below Do You Do Progress Invoicing? if you do 
progress invoicing. (I talk about progress invoicing or progress billing in the next 
section of this chapter.)
If you use estimates to create invoices, you actually create another way to track 
job costs. You can ask QuickBooks to prepare reports that compare, item by item, 
the estimated amounts for a job with the invoiced amounts for the job. To pro-
duce this report, you choose Reports  ➪  Jobs, Time & Mileage  ➪  Item Estimates vs. 
Actuals.

Progress Billing
Progress billing occurs when you actually invoice, or bill, a customer for a por-
tion of an amount that you’ve previously estimated. Take a peek at the Create 
Estimates window, shown in Figure 5-8 earlier in this chapter. Suppose that this 
window records an estimate that a client has asked you to supply. Further sup-
pose, just for purposes of this discussion, that the estimate is for a consulting job 
that you’re doing.
If you want to later bill the consulting client for the actual work, you click the 
Create Invoice button that appears along the top edge of the Create Estimates 
window. If you’ve previously chosen to do progress billing (see Figure  5-9), 
QuickBooks displays the Create Progress Invoice Based on Estimate dialog box 
(see Figure 5-10). This dialog box lets you create an invoice by using the estimate 
information.
If you select Create Invoice for the Entire Estimate (100%), QuickBooks creates 
one invoice that uses all the information from the Create Estimates window. Or 
you can select one of the other options to bill only a portion of the estimate. You 
can select the Create Invoice for a Percentage of the Entire Estimate radio ­button, 
for example, and then enter the percentage in the % of Estimate box. In this 
case, QuickBooks bills the customer for some specified percentage of the estimate. 
Alternatively, you can select the Create Invoice for Selected Items or for Different 
Percentages of Each Item radio button. In this case, QuickBooks lets you specify 
that different percentages of the items shown on the estimate should be billed.
When you click OK, QuickBooks either creates the invoice by using the estimate 
information or (if you indicated that you wanted to specify different percentages 
for different items on the invoice) displays the Specify Invoice Amounts for Items 
on Estimate dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-11. You use the Amount column to 
specify a portion of the estimated amount that you want to bill on the progress 
invoice.

If you select the Show Quantity and Rate check box on the Specify Invoice Amounts 
for Items on Estimate dialog box, QuickBooks adds columns to the dialog box 
that let you see quantity and rate information. Similarly, if you select the Show 
­Percentage check box, QuickBooks adds columns to the dialog box that show 
­percentages. You probably don’t need this extra information, but if it’s impor-
tant to be very precise in your invoice, you may want to experiment with these 
­additional columns of information.

Ratio Analysis
N
umbers from your financial statements make more sense when you can 
compare them with other numbers and external benchmarks. In this 
chapter, I talk about how you can perform this sort of analysis, which 
is called ratio analysis. Even if you’re not a numbers person, you can use ratio 
analysis to your benefit. Ratio analysis is easy to apply, and it enables even the 
nonquantitative type of person who uses it to better understand the information 
in financial statements.
Let me give you a quick example of ratio analysis. One particularly useful ratio is 
the gross margin percentage, which is your gross margin divided by your total sales. 
Although this ratio may not seem useful at first blush, it can be very valuable.
If you compare your gross margin percentage for this year with last year’s and see 
a decline, for example, you know that this isn’t good. Less gross margin means 
less money for operating expenses, interest expenses, and profits. On the other 
hand, if you compare your declining gross margin percentage with a competi-
tor’s and see that your competitor’s gross margin percentage is declining even 
more rapidly than yours, well, you know that’s good. This comparison shows that 
you may actually be in pretty good shape: At least you aren’t hurting like your 
competitor.

These are the sorts of insights that ratio analysis can provide. They enable you to 
put numbers from your income statement and balance sheet in context.
This chapter steps through the formulas, provides examples, and gives useful 
guidelines for 16 common financial ratios. I group the ratios into four categories: 
liquidity ratios, leverage (or debt) ratios, activity ratios, and profitability ratios.
Some Caveats about Ratio Analysis
Before you go any further in using ratio analysis to draw conclusions, consider 
these two warnings about it:
»
» The ratios are only as good as your inputs. Obviously, the more accurate 
your QuickBooks accounting records are, the more accurate any ratios that 
you calculate by using the numbers from your QuickBooks financial state-
ments will be. This makes sense, right? Garbage in, garbage out. Even if your 
financial records are garbage-free, if they contain something just slightly 
wacky, such as an unusually large transaction that skews all the numbers, 
your financial ratios aren’t as good as they might be.
»
» Ratios become relevant through comparison. Your financial ratios become 
most relevant — I’ve already hinted at this — when they compare your 
numbers with those of your competitors, the numbers that you had a year 
ago, and the numbers that a bank loan agreement specifies are necessary for 
you to continue achieving to be in the bank’s good graces. A comparison with 
other ratios is crucial because often, your numbers are just numbers if they 
can’t be compared with external benchmarks.
Industries commonly prepare reports that summarize financial ratio information 
for other firms in the industry. Early in my career, I was the controller of an elec-
tronics manufacturing firm. Our industry group, the American Electronics Asso-
ciation, prepared a financial ratio survey. With this financial ratio survey, I was 
able to easily compare the financial ratios of the firm I worked at with the finan-
cial ratios of other firms. Currently, as a CPA, I find it very useful that the Texas 
Society of CPAs and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants prepare an 
annual financial study that shows financial ratios for CPA firms around the United 
States. You probably also operate in an industry that has a professional associa-
tion. Keep your eyes and ears open to the possibility that this group or association 
prepares and distributes reports that include financial ratios. Such reports can be 
useful tools for you as you manage your firm.

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      353
Note: When you compare your firm with other firms by using financial ratios, you 
compare it with firms of a similar size. It usually doesn’t make sense to compare, 
for example, a million-dollar business with a billion-dollar business.
Some of the QuickBooks financial statements provide simple financial ratios 
­automatically. You can add the gross margin percentage (and other percentage 
measures) to the standard income statement and to the standard balance sheet, 
for example.
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios measure how easily and comfortably a firm can pay its immediate 
financial obligations and exploit immediate short-term financial opportunities. 
Everything else being equal, the firm that’s sitting on a large hoard of cash can 
more easily pay its bills and can take advantage of great opportunities that pop up. 
(If a competitor gets into trouble and wants to sell valuable assets at fire-sale 
prices, for example, a very liquid firm with great gobs of cash can more easily 
exploit such an opportunity.)
Current ratio
The current ratio liquidity measure compares a firm’s current assets with its 
­current liabilities. A firm’s current assets include cash, inventory, accounts 
receivable, and any other assets that can (or will be) quickly turned into cash. 
Most small businesses don’t have much in the way of other current assets, 
although they may have some, such as short-term investments. Current liabili-
ties include bills that must be paid in the coming year, such as accounts payable, 
wages payable, taxes payable, and — if you’re borrowing money on a long-term 
basis, such as through bank loans — the principal portions of the coming year’s 
payment on a loan.
The following is the exact formula used to calculate the current ratio:
current assets/current liabilities
The simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 gives you an example of how this 
current ratio formula works. As Table 1-1 shows, this firm’s current assets equal 
$50,000. The firm’s only current liability is $20,000 of accounts payable. (For 
purposes of this discussion, I’m assuming that this firm has no other current 
liabilities.)

354      BOOK 5  Financial Management
To calculate the current ratio of the firm described by the balance sheet in 
Table 1-1, you use the following formula:
$50,000/$20,000
This formula returns the value 2.5. Therefore, the value 2.5 is this firm’s current 
ratio.
Here’s a general guideline concerning current ratios: A firm’s current ratio should 
be a value of 2 or higher. In other words, the firm’s current assets should be 
double or more than double the firm’s current liabilities.
Acid test ratio
Also known as the quick ratio, the acid test ratio is a more severe measure of a firm’s 
liquidity. It serves the same general purpose as the current ratio, however. The 
acid test ratio indicates how easily a firm can meet its current financial obliga-
tions and exploit any financial opportunities that pop up.
The following formula is used for calculating the acid test ratio:
(current assets – inventory)/current liabilities

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      355
In the case of the business described by the balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, you 
use the following formula to calculate the acid test ratio:
$25,000/$20,000
This formula returns the value 1.25. Therefore, the value of 1.25 is this firm’s acid 
test ratio.
Here’s a guideline for acid test ratio: A firm’s acid test ratio should be a value of 
1 or higher. In other words, the current assets after you subtract the inventory 
should provide enough money to pay the current liabilities.
Leverage Ratios
Leverage ratios measure how much debt a firm carries and how easily a firm pays 
the interest expenses of carrying that debt. Leverage ratios are important for an 
obvious reason. Typically, a firm financed mostly with debt needs to continue to 
borrow to stay in business. (If this doesn’t make sense, think about what happens 
if a bank won’t extend a loan or won’t refinance a mortgage to a firm that’s heavily 
dependent on debt!)
What’s more, a firm that carries a lot of debt typically also spends a lot of money 
on interest expense. The heavy interest expense means that it’s especially impor-
tant for such a firm to have adequate operating income. Operating income is the 
income available to pay interest and other profits. A firm with a lot of operating 
income relative to its interest expense doesn’t really have much of a problem  
paying the interest  — and this is true even if operating income declines or 
decreases. In contrast, a firm with only very modest operating income relative to 
its interest expense quickly gets into trouble if the operating income decreases.
Debt ratio
The debt ratio simply shows the firm’s debt as a percentage of its capital struc-
ture. The term capital structure refers to the total liabilities and owner’s equity 
amount. In the case of the balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, the capital structure 
totals $320,000. Not coincidentally, the total liability and owner’s equity amount 
($320,000) equals the total assets amount ($320,000). This makes sense if you 
think about it a bit. A firm funds its assets with its capital. Therefore, the total 
assets always equal the total capital structure.

356      BOOK 5  Financial Management
The formula for calculating the debt ratio is a simple one:
total debt/total assets
Using numbers from the simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, for example, 
the debt ratio can be calculated as follows:
$120,000/$320,000
This formula returns the debt ratio of 0.375. This indicates that 37.5 percent of the 
firm’s capital comes from debt.
No guideline exists for debt ratio. Appropriate debt ratios vary by industry and by 
the size of the firm in an industry. In general, small firms that use QuickBooks 
probably want to show lower debt ratios than larger firms do. Small firms, in my 
experience, see their operating income fluctuate more wildly than large firms do. 
Because of that fluctuation, carrying and servicing such debt are more problematic. 
Lower debt, therefore, is probably better. This makes sense, of course, so I’m not 
telling you anything that you don’t already know.
Debt equity ratio
A debt equity ratio compares a firm’s long-term debt with stockholders’ equity or 
owner’s equity. Essentially, the debt equity ratio expresses a firm’s long-term 
debt as a percentage of its owner’s equity.
Stockholders’ equity is synonymous with owner’s equity and, in the case of a sole 
proprietorship, with a sole proprietor’s capital account.
Following is the formula used to calculate a debt equity ratio:
long-term debt/stockholders’ equity
By using the example balance sheet shown in Table 1-1, you can calculate the debt 
equity ratio by using this formula:
$100,000/$200,000
This formula returns the debt equity ratio of 0.5. Therefore, this firm’s long-term 
debt equals 0.5, or 50 percent of its owner’s equity.
I can’t really give you a guideline for a debt equity ratio. You simply compare your 
debt equity ratio with the debt equity ratios of similar-size firms in your industry. 
As is the case with the debt ratio previously described, all other things being equal, 
the less long-term debt you carry, the better.

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      357
Times interest earned ratio
The times interest earned ratio indicates how easily a firm pays interest expenses 
incurred on its debt. To calculate the times interest earned ratio, you need an 
income statement that shows both operating income and interest expense. 
Table 1-2 provides this information.
The following formula is used for calculating the times interest earned ratio:
operating income/interest expense
If you look at the income statement shown in Table 1-2, you see that operating 
income, which is the income that a firm has before paying its interest expense, 
equals $60,000. Interest expense shows up as $10,000. Therefore, you calculate 
the times interest earned ratio by using this formula:
$60,000/$10,000
This formula returns the times interest earned ratio of 6. Therefore, the firm’s 
operating profits pay the interest expense six times over.
No standard guideline exists for the times interest earned ratio. Obviously, how-
ever, the times interest earned ratio should indicate that a firm can easily pay its 
interest expense. It would be sort of scary, if you think about it, for the operating 
income to be only a little bit greater than the firm’s interest expense. Such a situ-
ation would indicate that a modest drop in operating income would make paying 
interest expense impossible.

Fixed-charges coverage ratio
The fixed-charges coverage ratio resembles the times interest earned ratio. The 
fixed-charges coverage ratio calculates how easily a firm pays not only its interest 
expenses, but also any principal payments on loans and any other payments that 
the firm is legally obligated to make.
The fixed-charges coverage ratio uses the following formula:
income available for fixed charges/fixed charges
Returning to the example business described by the balance sheet shown in 
Table 1-1 and the income statement shown in Table 1-2, suppose that the $5,000 
of rent shown in the income statement is actually a fixed charge because the firm 
is renting space on a long-term lease. Further suppose that for the purpose of 
this ratio, although it doesn’t show up on the income statement, the $100,000 
loan that shows up on the balance sheet requires an annual $5,000 in principal 
payments.
In this case, this firm is obligated to pay fixed charges as summarized in Table 1-3. 
In total, then, fixed charges for this firm equal $20,000 a year.
The other input needed to calculate the fixed-charges coverage ratio is the income 
available for these fixed charges. Table 1-4 shows you how to calculate the income 
available for fixed charges. You start with the operating income, which equals 
$60,000, as shown in Table  1-2. (Remember that the operating income is the 
income before paying interest expense.) You must add to the operating income 
any fixed charges included in the income statement. In this case, the rent turns 
out to be a fixed charge. Therefore, you need to add the $5,000 of rent to the oper-
ating income to get income available for fixed charges. As Table 1-4 shows, the 
income available for fixed charges equals $65,000.

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      359
With the two needed inputs, you can calculate the fixed-charges coverage ratio by 
using this formula:
$65,000/$20,000
This formula returns a fixed-charges coverage ratio of 3.25, which indicates that 
the firm generates slightly more than three times as much income as needed to 
pay its fixed charges.
No guideline exists to specify what your fixed-charges coverage ratio should be. 
In fact, it’s particularly difficult to get the information necessary to think about 
fixed-charge coverage ratios because fixed charges don’t clearly appear in the 
standard set of simple financial statements. One of the things that make financial 
statements (that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles) so useful is that the fixed-charges information is usually disclosed in 
little footnotes that appear at the end of the financial statements.
Activity Ratios
Activity ratios provide an indication of how efficiently a firm runs its operations. 
All other factors being equal, a firm that keeps a very modest amount of inventory 
is in better shape than a firm that has to keep (store, manage, warehouse, insure, 
and so forth) a bunch of inventory. That makes sense, right?
The computer manufacturer Dell, as you may know, keeps only a few days’ worth 
of inventory on hand. In other words, it sells out its current inventory holdings 
every few days. Other computer manufacturers — especially in the past — kept 
weeks’ and even months’ worth of inventory. Comparing the two examples, which 
is more efficiently and more leanly managing its inventory? Which has the minimal 
investment tied up? Which isn’t suffering or paying the price of warehousing all 
that extra, quickly obsolete inventory? The answer is Dell, obviously. So predict-
ably, Dell’s activity ratios look really good compared with those of its competitors.
Activity ratios, in essence, measure how well a firm uses its assets. If a firm 
makes super-efficient use of its factory, for example, that efficiency shows up in 
TABLE 1-4 
Income Available for Fixed Charges
Operating income

Add-back of rent
5,000
Fixed charges
$65,000

360      BOOK 5  Financial Management
its activity ratios. And if a firm runs lean and mean, that leanness and meanness 
show up in its activity ratios.
Inventory turnover ratio
The inventory turnover ratio measures how many times in an accounting period the 
inventory balance sells out. The formula is as follows:
cost of goods sold/average inventory
In the example business described by the balance sheet in Table  1-1 and the 
income statement in Table 1-2, you can use the following formula to calculate 
the inventory turnover:
$30,000/$25,000
This formula returns the inventory turnover ratio of 1.2.
Technically, you shouldn’t use just an ending inventory balance, which is what 
appears in Table 1-1. You should use an average inventory balance. You can calculate 
an average inventory balance in all the usual, common-sense ways. You can use 
the inventory balance both from this year’s balance sheet and the previous year’s 
balance sheet and then average them, for example.
The inventory turnover period, as you may have noticed, depends on the period 
measured in the income statement. If the income statement is an annual state-
ment and, therefore, the cost of goods sold (COGS) amount is an annual COGS 
amount, an inventory turnover ratio of 1.2 means that a firm sells 120 percent 
of its inventory balance in a year. If the inventory turnover ratio uses the COGS 
amount reported in a monthly income statement, the inventory turnover period 
is a month. With a monthly COGS amount, a firm with a 1.2 inventory ratio sells  
120 percent of its inventory in a month.
No guideline exists for inventory turnover ratios. A good inventory turnover ratio 
depends on what your competitors are doing within your industry. If you want to 
stay competitive, you want an inventory turnover ratio that at least comes close 
to your competitors’ ratios.
Days of inventory ratio
The days of inventory ratio resembles the inventory turnover financial ratio; it esti-
mates how many days of inventory a firm is storing. The ratio uses the following 
formula:

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      361
average inventory/(annual cost of goods sold/365)
The simple balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 shows inventory equal to $25,000. 
Assume that this also equals the average inventory that the firm carries. In order 
to calculate the daily sales, you take the COGS number reported in the annual 
income statement shown in Table 1-2 and divide it by 365 (the number of days in 
a year). Putting these numbers together in the formula just introduced, the math 
looks like this:
$25,000/($30,000/365)
This formula returns the value 304 (roughly). This value means that this firm 
is carrying roughly 304 days of inventory. Stated another way, this firm would 
require 304 days of sales to sell its entire inventory.
As is the case with the inventory turnover ratio, you don’t see generalized rules 
about what is an acceptable number for days of inventory. The general rule is that 
you turn around your inventory just as quickly as your competitor does.
I return to the case of Dell because it’s so instructive — even if scary — to most 
of us. Dell sells out its inventory in a few days. Dell’s competitors were taking 
months to sell out their inventory. In an industry in which inventory was quickly 
becoming obsolete and was very expensive to start with, think of the competi-
tive disadvantage that Dell’s competitors suffered by having to carry inventory 
for months longer than Dell did. Is it any wonder that many of Dell’s competitors 
got into trouble? The lesson of Dell applies to many folks who run or advise busi-
nesses that carry inventory. Inventory turnover and days of inventory ratios need 
to be watched carefully and compared with those of other firms of the same size 
in the same industry.
Average collection period ratio
The average collection period ratio shows how long it takes for a firm to collect on 
its receivables. You can think about this ratio as being a measure of the quality 
of a firm’s credit and collection procedures. In other words, this ratio shows how 
smart a firm is about deciding to whom to extend credit. This ratio also shows how 
effective a firm is in collecting from customers.
The average collection period ratio formula looks like this:
average accounts receivable/average credit sales per day
The balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 doesn’t show an average accounts receivable 
balance. The income statement shown in Table 1-2 also doesn’t break out sales 

362      BOOK 5  Financial Management
into credit and cash components. Therefore, let me introduce another example 
into the text. Suppose that in the business you run, the average accounts receiv-
able is $60,000. Further suppose that your average credit daily sales equal $1,000. 
Using the formula just given, you can calculate the average collection period as 
follows:
$60,000/$1,000
This formula returns the value 60. In this case, your business has 60 days of sales 
in accounts receivable.
The guideline about the average collection period is that it should tie to your pay-
ment terms. If your average number of days of credit sales in accounts receivable 
equals 60, for example, your payment terms should probably be something like 
net 60 days (which means that customers are supposed to pay you in 60 days or 
less). Your average collection period, in other words, should show that most of 
your customers are paying on time. Remember that some of your customers will 
pay early, and obviously, some of your customers will pay a bit late. You hope that 
on average, customers pay on time.
Fixed-asset turnover ratio
The fixed-asset turnover ratio quantifies how efficiently a firm employs its fixed 
assets. Predictably, this financial ratio is most useful when a firm has a lot of fixed 
assets: real estate, equipment, and so forth.
The fixed-asset turnover ratio uses the following formula:
sales/fixed assets
Based on the numbers supplied by the balance sheet shown in Table 1-1 and the 
income statement shown in Table 1-2, you can calculate the following fixed-asset 
turnover ratio:
$150,000/$270,000
This formula returns the value of 0.556. In a nutshell, this ratio says that this firm 
requires $270,000 of fixed assets to produce $150,000 of sales — or, more specifi-
cally, that the firm produces sales equal to roughly 56 percent of its fixed assets.
As is the case with many of these financial ratios, no guideline exists that you can 
use to determine a good fixed-asset turnover ratio. You compare your fixed-asset 
turnover ratio with those of firms of a similar size in your industry.

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      363
Total assets turnover ratio
The total assets turnover ratio also measures how efficiently you’re employing your 
assets. This ratio is probably more appropriate for a firm that doesn’t have a lot 
of fixed assets but still wins or loses the game of business based on how well it 
manages its assets.
The total assets turnover ratio formula is as follows:
sales/total assets
Here’s a formula that calculates the ratio by using the financial data from 
Tables 1-1 and 1-2, shown earlier. If the total sales equal $150,000 and the total 
assets equal $320,000, the following formula makes the calculation:
$150,000/$320,000
This formula returns the ratio 0.469, which means that the firm generates sales 
equal to roughly 47 percent of its total assets.
The total assets turnover ratio that you calculate for your business can’t be com-
pared with some external benchmark or standardized rule. You compare your ratio 
with the same ratio of similar-size businesses in your industry. Obviously, your 
main consideration is whether you’re efficiently using your assets to produce 
sales relative to those of your competitors. The more sales you can produce with a 
given level of assets, the better off your business is.
Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios analyze a firm’s profitability. In a sense, profitability ratios are 
the most important ratios that you can calculate. They typically provide terribly 
useful insights into how profitable a firm is and why.
One particularly important profitability ratio is the gross margin percentage, 
which expresses gross margin as a percentage of sales. As discussed in Book 6, 
Chapter  1, you can calculate a firm’s break-even point simply by dividing the 
firm’s fixed costs by its gross margin percentage.
Gross margin percentage
Also known as the gross profit margin ratio, the gross margin percentage shows 
how much a firm has left over after paying its COGS. The gross margin is what 

364      BOOK 5  Financial Management
pays the operating expenses; financing expenses (interest); and, of course, the 
profits.
The gross margin percentage ratio uses the following formula:
gross margin/sales
Using the data from Table 1-2 (shown earlier), you can calculate gross margin 
percentage as follows:
$120,000/$150,000
This formula returns the value of 0.8, meaning that gross margin equals 
80 ­percent of the firm’s sales.
No guideline exists for what a gross margin percentage should be. Some firms 
enjoy very high gross margins. Other firms make good money even though the 
gross margin percentages are very low. In general, of course, the higher the gross 
margin percentage, the better.
I need to make one cautionary statement here: In my humble opinion, small 
businesses should enjoy high gross margin percentages. I think it’s common to 
assume that a small business can get away with a lower gross margin percentage 
than some large competitors can. In my experience, however, that isn’t really true. 
Gross margin percentages should be higher for small businesses because small 
businesses often can’t get the economies of scale that large businesses can get. 
A low gross margin percentage may work just fine for Walmart, for example, but 
it’s tough for a small retailer to work with such a small gross margin percentage.
Operating income/sales
In the case of the business shown earlier in Table 1-2, where operating income 
equals $60,000 and sales equals $150,000, you calculate the net operating margin 
percentage by using this formula:
$60,000/$150,000
This formula returns the value 0.4. In other words, you see a 40 percent operat-
ing margin, which indicates that a firm’s operating income equals 40 percent of 
its sales.
No guideline exists for what a net operating margin percentage should be. Your 
main consideration, which you’ll probably find yourself repeating in your sleep 

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      365
after reading it so much in this book, is that you want to be competitive. You want 
your operating margin percentage to be close to or better than your competitors’ 
percentages. That parity (or superiority) enables you to stay competitive.
Profit margin percentage
The profit margin percentage works like the net operating margin percentage. It 
expresses the firm’s net income as a percentage of sales, as shown in the follow-
ing formula:
net income/sales
In the case of the business described by the income statement shown in Table 1-2, 
the net income equals $50,000, and sales equals $150,000. This firm’s profit 
­margin percentage, therefore, can be calculated with the following formula:
$50,000/$150,000
This formula returns a financial ratio of 0.33. This indicates that the firm’s net 
income equals roughly 33 percent of its sales.
Return on assets
The return on assets shows the return that the firm delivers to stockholders and the 
interest that the firm pays to lenders as the percentage of the firm’s assets. Some 
businesses use return on assets to evaluate the business’s profitability. (Banks do 
this, for example.)
The actual formula is
(net income + interest)/total assets
In the case of the example business described earlier in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, the 
net income equals $50,000. Interest expense equals $10,000. Total assets equal 
$320,000. The formula to calculate this firm’s return on assets is
($50,000 + $10,000)/$320,000
This formula returns the value 0.188. This value indicates that the firm’s return 
(including both net income and interest) on its assets is roughly 19 percent.

366      BOOK 5  Financial Management
No guideline exists for what a return on assets ratio should be. The main consid-
eration is, predictably, that the return on assets must exceed the capital charges 
on the assets.
In Book 5, Chapter 2, I talk more about capital charges and how they relate to 
something called Economic Value Added analysis. Capital charges aren’t complicated 
to understand. The bottom line is that a firm needs to deliver a return on its 
assets that exceeds the funding sources cost for those assets. In other words, if (on  
average) the creditor and shareholders providing money to a firm want something 
less than, for example, 19 percent, and the firm can earn 19 percent as its return 
on assets, that’s really good. If, on the other hand, the return on assets percentage  
is 18.8 percent, but the funding sources for those assets cost 20 percent, well, 
that’s not so good. That firm is in trouble.
The term capital charge equals the sum of the minimum profit that shareholders 
require to invest their money in a firm and the interest charges that lenders 
require for the money that they’ve loaned to the firm.
Return on equity
The return on equity financial ratio expresses a firm’s net income as a percentage of 
its owner’s equity or shareholders’ equity. (Shareholders’ and owner’s equity are 
the same thing.)
The formula, which is deceptively simple, is as follows:
net income/owner’s equity
In the case of the example business described earlier in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, net 
income equals $50,000, and owner’s equity equals $200,000. This firm’s return 
on equity, therefore, can be calculated by using the following formula:
$50,000/$200,000
This formula returns the value of 0.25, which means that this firm’s return on 
equity is 25 percent — a number that’s probably pretty good.
No guideline exists for what is and isn’t an acceptable return on equity. I can make 
two useful observations, however, about how you should interpret the return on 
equity ratio that you calculate:
»
» The return on equity ratio that you calculate needs to be at least as good 
as you deserve. Okay, that sounds circular. So think about it this way: If you’re 

Ratio Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Ratio Analysis      367
investing money in your business, you deserve a return on that money. And 
that return needs to be reasonable compared with your other alternatives. 
If you can go out and invest money in a stock market mutual fund and get 
10 percent, you shouldn’t be investing in things that deliver a return of less 
than 10 percent. That makes sense, right? Therefore, if you want to earn a 
20 percent return on the money that you’ve invested in your own firm (by the 
way, a 20 percent return is a very reasonable return for a small business), you 
want to make sure that your return on equity (after you get going) exceeds 
this minimum return.
»
» The return on equity ratio hints at the sustainable growth rate that your 
firm can manage. This sounds complicated, but you need to understand 
what sustainable growth is and how it ties back to the return on equity ratio. 
Sustainable growth is the growth rate that your business can sustain over a long 
period: three years, five years, ten years, and so on. If you don’t take money 
out of the business (other than your salary), and you reinvest the return on 
equity that the business generates, the return on equity ratio equals your 
sustainable growth. In other words, the example business described earlier  
in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 can grow on a sustained basis as fast as 25 percent.
Alternatively, suppose that the owners of the imaginary firm described in the 
financial statements in this chapter take half the equity money out of the busi-
ness. Perhaps half the $50,000 net income is distributed as a dividend to share-
holders, for example. In this case, because only half the return on equity is 
reinvested, sustainable growth equals only half the return on equity percentage. If 
the return on equity percentage equals 25 percent, but the owners withdraw half 
the return (12.5 percent), the reinvested half of the return on equity percentage 
(12.5 ­percent) equals the sustainable growth rate. In other words, this business 
can grow on a sustained basis at 12.5 percent annually.
In my experience, this sustainable growth business makes intuitive sense to some 
people, but it just leads to head-scratching for other people. In case you’re in the 
head-scratching group, consider a couple more comments:
»
» Growing sales and profits also requires growing your capital structure. The 
idea of a sustainable growth rate (which was pioneered by Hewlett-Packard, 
interestingly enough) is based on an intuitively understandable proposition: 
To grow your sales and your profits over the long run, you need to grow your 
assets. If you’re going to double your sales and your profits, for example, 
you’re probably going to have to double your assets. And if you double your 
assets, you must double your funding of those assets. Doubled funding of 
your assets means that you double your borrowing and your owner’s equity. 
Assuming that you can get creditors to loan you more money — that should 
be possible if you’re growing not only sales, but also profits — you still need to 

368      BOOK 5  Financial Management
double your owner’s equity. And the way that you usually double or grow your 
owner’s equity in a small business is by reinvesting the return on the equity.
Large businesses have another way to grow owner’s equity. A large business, 
such as Hewlett-Packard, can go out into the capital markets and raise money 
by issuing stock. In fact, the real reason for making a company public isn’t to 
make the owners rich, but to access the public’s capital markets. Those 
markets provide access to almost unlimited amounts of capital (that is, unless 
you pull an Enron or WorldCom by proving that you don’t deserve access to 
the capital markets). In the case in which a firm can tap these capital markets 
for cash or funding, the sustainable growth rate formula gets more compli-
cated. These capital markets provide another way to grow owner’s equity.
»
» If you don’t grow owner’s equity as your business grows, watch out. You’ll 
have big problems if you ignore the sustainable growth rate and your 
business grows fast. If you don’t grow your owner’s equity at least as fast as 
your business grows, your debt percentage ratio skyrockets (perhaps) without 
your even realizing it. Just think about this logically: If your sales double, your 
assets probably double. And if your owner’s equity doesn’t double, creditors 
have to make up the difference. Exploding debt means that it becomes all 
the more important for you to refinance that debt and refinance even larger 
amounts of that debt. And exploding debt means that your interest expense 
is growing all the time because your debt levels are rising.

Economic Value 
Added Analysis

ere’s a curious fact: Even if your QuickBooks profit and loss statement 
shows a profit, you may not actually be making any money. How can 
this be? Ah, to really answer this question, you need to use a tool called 
Economic Value Added analysis (EVA), which was developed by (and is a trademark 
of) Stern Stewart & Co., a management consulting firm.
In this chapter, I discuss what EVA does and how you can use the information that 
you create with QuickBooks to perform the EVA analysis. This is neat stuff but 
a bit theoretical. Fortunately, when you boil EVA down to its essence, it’s quite 
practical.
Introducing the Logic of EVA
Economic Value Added analysis states in a formula something you already know 
in your gut: If you’re a business owner, and you can make more money by selling 
your business, reinvesting the proceeds, and then getting another job someplace  
else, hey  — you’re not doing yourself or your family any financial favors by  
running your own business.

370      BOOK 5  Financial Management
Let me walk you through an example to show you mathematically why this is the 
case. Suppose that after you pay yourself a fair salary, your firm makes $20,000 in 
additional profits. Further suppose that you can sell your firm to a competitor for 
$200,000, invest the proceeds in a stock mutual fund, and earn about $20,000 
a year in profits. (Yes, I know that the stock market doesn’t promise 10 percent  
annual returns, but neither does your business. So just suppose that these numbers 
are right for the purposes of this discussion.)
In this simple example, running your own business doesn’t really make sense. 
Sure, you’re making a salary. And sure, you’re earning a return on the money that 
you and your family have invested. But you aren’t getting anything more than 
that. You may as well just sell your firm, reinvest the money in the stock market 
(just one option), and get a job working for the phone company.
Don’t get all bummed out on me here; I’m not trying to talk you into selling your 
business. I just want to explain how to use a powerful tool, EVA, to better manage 
your business.
Seeing EVA in Action
EVA analysis has two variations; I explain the simple version first. If I start with 
the simple version, you may better understand all the little nuances and subtleties 
of the EVA model from the very start. When you’re finished with the simple ver-
sion of EVA analysis — called equity-based EVA — you’re ready to move on to the 
more complicated EVA model.
Before I proceed with this discussion, take a gander at a couple of financial 
­statements. Table 2-1 shows a simple income statement, and Table 2-2 shows 
a simple balance sheet. These two financial statements provide much  — and 
maybe most — of the information that you need to perform EVA analysis for your 
business. In fact, just go ahead and suppose that these two financial statements 
describe your business.
If you’re uncomfortable interpreting either income statements or balance sheet 
financial statements, you may want to review the material covered in Book 1, 
Chapter 1. In that chapter, I describe how financial statements work.
If you’re not sure how to produce a financial statement by using QuickBooks, 
refer to Book 4, Chapter 2. In that chapter, I describe how to prepare QuickBooks 
financial statements, including income statements (also known as profit and loss 
statements) and balance sheets.

Economic Value Added

CHAPTER 2  Economic Value Added Analysis      371
Essentially, EVA includes a charge for the capital that you’ve invested in a busi-
ness. To see whether you’re actually making money, you deduct this charge from 
your net income. A positive EVA amount indicates that your business truly pro-
duces an economic profit; in other words, a positive EVA amount indicates that

372      BOOK 5  Financial Management
even after your firm pays wages to employees, interest to lenders, and a return to 
shareholders, some money is left over. This leftover money is the economic profit.
The capital charge equals the cost of the capital (specified as an interest rate 
or annual return percentage) multiplied by the capital invested in the business 
period. The capital invested in your business equals, essentially, your owner’s 
equity. The cost of capital return percentage equals the return that you could earn 
in a similarly risky investment in something else.
An example of EVA
From the example data in Tables 2-1 and 2-2, calculate each of these amounts by 
following these steps:
1.	 Calculate the capital charge.
For the sake of illustration, suppose that you earn a 20 percent return on the 
money that you’ve invested in the business described in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. 
To calculate an EVA in this situation, use the following formula:
capital charge = 20% × $200,000 (of owner’s equity)
The result of this formula is a capital charge of $40,000. That’s the amount that 
should be returned to the shareholders. (In the case of a small business owned and 
operated by an entrepreneur, the sole shareholder is the owner/entrepreneur.)
2.	 Subtract the capital charge from the net income.
In Table 2-1, the net income equals $50,000. To calculate the EVA, use the 
following formula:
net income ($50,000) – capital charge ($40,000) = EVA
The result — $10,000 — equals the EVA.
Therefore, when you use the data from the example business detailed in Tables 2-1  
and  2-2 and assume a 20 percent cost of capital, you find that this business  
delivers an economic profit. After paying each stakeholder his or her fair share, the 
firm also has leftover money — an economic profit — of $10,000.
Another example of EVA
To continue this example, suppose that the capital charge is really $50,000 (cal-
culated by multiplying a 25 percent cost of capital percentage by the $200,000 of 
capital or owner’s equity). In this case, what does the EVA equal? The answer is 
zero. In other words, if the business makes $50,000 of profit (refer to Table 2-1), 

Economic Value Added 
Analysis
CHAPTER 2  Economic Value Added Analysis      373
but the shareholders require a $50,000 return on their investment (calculated as 
25 percent multiplied by $200,000), the business produces no EVA.
Does the preceding scenario make sense to you? The math may seem a little 
unwieldy, but don’t get too tangled up in the computations. My guess is that you 
understand in your gut what EVA analysis does. If you really did own a business 
like the one summarized in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2, you know that you should be 
earning a fair return on the money that you and your family have invested. And if 
you’re earning only the same amount of money that you could earn in any other 
business — say, a stock mutual fund — you’re not really getting ahead.
That’s all EVA analysis really does. It makes sure that you’re getting at least a fair 
return (ideally, more than that) on your investment.
Reviewing Some Important  
Points about EVA
The purpose of EVA analysis is simple: You want to see whether you’re earning an 
economic profit by owning your own business.
To make sure that you’re on track with your analysis, you typically want to 
­consider several things:
»
» How good are the numbers? This is an important point. Do your income 
statement and balance sheet values really describe your profit (one of the 
numbers used in your calculation) and the value that you may be able to sell 
for and then reinvest (another important value used in your calculation)? 
You’re always going to have to accept some imprecision in your numbers. 
That’s a fact of life. But a lot of imprecision in those two numbers corrupts 
the results.
You should compare your owner’s equity value with what you think you would 
get if you sold your business. If your owner’s equity value (the amount shown 
on your balance sheet) is wildly different from the cash-out value, you probably 
should use the cash-out value in your EVA analysis rather than the owner’s 
equity value.
»
» How good is the cost of capital percentage? The capital charge calculation 
relies heavily on the cost of capital value. This is a tough number to come up 
with, quite frankly. If you owned a billion-dollar business, you’d probably need a 
team of PhDs to come up with a number for you (and clearly, this isn’t feasible 
for a small business). Therefore, I recommend that you use a range of values. 

374      BOOK 5  Financial Management
Many people think that a small business (any business with sales less than, say, 
$50 million) should produce returns annually of 20 to 25 percent. That seems 
to be a good range of values to use in EVA analysis. You may also be interested 
to know that for a large company, the cost of capital rates run from approxi-
mately 10 to 12 percent. So you clearly don’t want to be that low. Finally, note 
that venture capital returns — those returns delivered by the most successful, 
fastest-growing small businesses — often run 35 to 45 percent annually. It 
seems, therefore, that the cost of capital rates used in your EVA analysis should 
be considerably less than this. At least for most businesses, the cost of capital 
rates should be considerably less than 35 to 45 percent.
Try a range of rates when you perform EVA analysis. First try 15 percent  
as your cost of capital, for example; then try 20 percent, 25 percent, and  
30 percent. The calculations, after you have the profit number and the owner’s 
equity number, are pretty simple after all. It’s really not difficult to calculate 
several estimates of EVA.
»
» What about psychological income? In the case of an owner-managed 
business, I think it’s okay to factor in psychological income. You can’t ignore 
the economy. A viable, healthy business — especially if it’s yours — should 
deliver a nice profit over time and pay for the capital that it uses. Having said 
that, however, if you really love your work, I’m the last guy to say that you 
should sell your winery and go to work for the local big-box retailer. (Not that 
there’s anything wrong with wearing an orange vest and spending all day on 
concrete floors.) My point is that in my opinion, owning your own business is 
about more than just an economic profit.
»
» Have fluctuations occurred? Another important point is that in many small 
businesses (and in all the small businesses that I’ve owned and managed), 
profits fluctuate. Therefore, you can’t look at just a single, perhaps terribly bad 
year and decide that it’s time to pack up. Similarly, you shouldn’t look at just a 
single blowout year and decide that it’s time to buy the villa in the south of 
France. EVA analysis works when the inputs reflect the general condition of 
the business: the general level of profits, the general amount for which you 
could cash out, the general cost of capital estimate, and so on. If something 
screwy happens one year to push one of these inputs way out of whack, the 
results returned by your EVA analysis become pretty undependable, in my 
opinion.
»
» Is your business in a special situation? Everybody admits that EVA analysis 
is really tricky and may be impossible in certain situations. Most people who 
love EVA analysis readily admit that EVA analysis doesn’t work very well in a 
start-up business situation, for example. Most of these people also admit that 
EVA analysis doesn’t work very well when a firm is growing very quickly. In 
both of these cases, the problem is that the income statement just doesn’t 
produce an accurate measure of the value being created by the company.  

Economic Value Added 
Analysis
CHAPTER 2  Economic Value Added Analysis      375
As a result, it’s impossible to really figure out what sort of economic profit the 
business has created. Again, this should make intuitive sense. You may very 
well expect that in the first year or two, the business produces a loss or very 
meager profits. And that’s totally okay.
Your EVA calculation is only as good as your inputs and assumptions. The trend 
or pattern in EVA values is probably more important than a particular value. And 
that’s especially true for business owners. In the end, you can’t lose sight of 
the big picture, which is answering the question “Am I really making money by 
­running my own business?”
Using EVA When Your Business Has Debt
In very large businesses, EVA analysis gets computationally burdensome. Although 
I don’t go into great detail about potential problems in this chapter, you should be 
familiar with one common complication: debt.
Here’s the deal. If a business can restructure its debt, bank loans, credit lines, 
mortgages, and so forth, borrowing can be used to boost EVA. Accordingly, and 
quite helpfully, another EVA model that’s slightly more complicated enables you 
to recognize this extra wrinkle. In this section, I provide a couple of examples of 
how this slightly more sophisticated EVA model works.
The first example of the  
modified EVA formula
If your firm can freely restructure its debts, you may want to make two adjust-
ments to the EVA analysis:
»
» You may need to use an all-encompassing cost of capital. An all-encompassing 
cost of capital considers both the cost of equity (this is what I did earlier in the 
first part of this chapter) and the cost of any debt.
»
» You use an adjusted net income number that includes not only the amounts 
paid to the shareholders, but also the amounts paid to lenders.
Calculating an all-encompassing cost of capital is the first step. For the sake of 
illustration, suppose that a business uses capital from three sources: trade ven-
dors, a bank (which lends money at 10 percent), and owner’s equity. Table 2-3 
shows an approach to estimating the capital charge that needs to be compared 
with the net income when this other debt is considered.

376      BOOK 5  Financial Management
Let me walk you through the numbers in Table 2-3, although none of them is 
difficult to figure out:
»
» Trade vendors: The trade vendors provide debt — $20,000 in the balance 
sheet shown in Table 2-2 — but the firm doesn’t have to pay a charge to those 
creditors. In effect, any implicit charge that the firm pays to trade vendors is 
already counted in the amount that you pay those vendors for the products 
or services that they supply. So that portion of the capital charge is zero.
»
» Bank loan: This $100,000 bank loan charges 10 percent. That bank loan, then, 
carries a $10,000 capital charge. In other words, in order to use the bank’s 
capital, the business pays $10,000 a year.
»
» Owner’s equity: This final component of the capital charge is what the 
business owes the owners. In Table 2-3, the owner’s equity capital charge is 
shown as $40,000. (This is the same $40,000 capital charge discussed earlier 
in the chapter.) This capital charge is calculated by multiplying a cost of capital 
percentage, 20 percent, by the owner’s equity (20 percent of $200,000 equals 
$40,000). The adjusted capital charge, therefore, equals $50,000.
Okay. So far, so good. The second step in working with this slightly more com-
plicated EVA model is to add back the interest charges paid to lenders to achieve 
an adjusted income number. Think about this for a minute. The business made 
$50,000 in income (as shown in Table 2-1), but this amount has already been 
adjusted for $10,000 of interest expense. Therefore, if you want to compare the 
funds that the business generated and that are available to pay capital sources, 
you need to add back the $10,000 of interest expense. In other words, when you’re 
looking at paying all the capital sources of return (whether in the form of interest 
or dividends), you have not only the $50,000 of net income, but also the $10,000 
of interest expense. Does that make sense?
Finally, there’s a pot of money left over at the end to pay creditors and owners. 
And that pot of money, as shown on the income statement in Table 2-1 earlier in 
this chapter, includes both the $10,000 of interest expense and the $50,000 of net 
income.

Analysis
CHAPTER 2  Economic Value Added Analysis      377
After you’ve figured out an all-encompassing cost of capital and an adjusted 
income amount, you can calculate the EVA in the usual way. In this example, you 
use the following formula:
adjusted income ($60,000) – the weighted cost of capital charge ($50,000)
The result equals $10,000, which is the EVA amount.
It’s no coincidence that the simple EVA formula and the more complicated EVA 
formula return the same result. EVA shouldn’t change because you use a more 
complicated formula — as long as both the simple and complicated formulas are 
correct. (They are.) So what’s up? The more complicated formula lets you see how 
changes in your debt affect the EVA.
Another EVA with debt example
Here’s another example of the modified EVA approach. Suppose that you, the 
business owner, go down to the bank and take out another $100,000 loan. Then 
suppose that the business pays this amount out to the business owner (you) in the 
form of a dividend. If this transaction occurred at the beginning of the year, you 
get the income statement and balance sheet shown in Table 2-4 and Table 2-5 
(reflecting the additional loan).

In other words, the only differences between the description of the business in 
Tables 2-1 and 2-2 and its description in these two tables are that the firm has 
$100,000 more debt and $100,000 less owner’s equity, and the extra debt pro-
duces another $10,000 a year of interest expense. That’s pretty straightforward, 
right? All I’ve really talked about is using more debt and less owner’s equity.
Table 2-6 estimates the capital charge for this new, more highly leveraged firm. 
Once again, let me walk you through the components of the capital charge. The 
trade vendors, who supply $20,000 of trade credit in the form of accounts pay-
able, don’t charge anything, so there’s no capital charge for their contribution to 
the firm’s capital structure. In the new, more highly leveraged firm, the bank loan 
charge has gone way up. Now the firm is carrying a $200,000 loan. With 10 per-
cent interest, the capital charge on the loan rises to $20,000 annually.

The final owner’s equity capital charge also changes: It drops. With the decrease 
in owner’s equity to just $100,000, the 20 percent capital charge decreases to 
$20,000 a year.
When you add up all the bits and pieces, you come up with an adjusted capital 
charge of $40,000. Remember that this is the capital charge for the new, more 
highly leveraged business.
For this new, more highly leveraged business, the EVA changes. The adjusted 
income for the business is $60,000 (calculated as the $40,000 of net income 
plus $20,000 of interest expense). You can calculate the EVA by subtracting the 
$40,000 capital charge from the $60,000 of adjusted income. The result equals 
$20,000 of EVA. The EVA doubles, obviously, when the business is more highly 
leveraged.
This second example shows why the more complicated EVA formula can be useful. 
The example recognizes more explicitly how EVA results when a firm produces 
income in excess of the capital charges.
Presenting Two Final Pointers
I want to share two final pointers with business owners who may want to use EVA 
analysis to think about the economics of their businesses. (My first point is pretty 
basic, but I think it’s probably the most important thing to take away from this 
chapter.)
»
» EVA analysis is most useful to business owners and managers — or at 
least to owners and managers of small and medium-size firms — as a 
thinking tool. In other words, even if you don’t scratch out the numbers on 
the back of an envelope, EVA makes sense as a way to think about how you 
should run your business and whether it makes sense to make changes. 
Comparing your firm’s net income with the amount that you could earn by 
selling and then reinvesting the capital elsewhere is a useful concept.
I have a literary agent friend who likes to say, “Listen to the universe.” I think 
that his suggestion, especially as it relates to the economics of running a 
business, is pretty darn good. You should listen to the economy when you 
think about your business, and EVA provides a tool for you to do that. For a 
business to make sense, it needs to return a fair share to each of its stake-
holders: wages to employees; interest and debt service payments to lenders; 
a return to shareholders who invested capital; and then, as a practical matter, 
a little something left over for you, the owner. Indeed, in order for a business 
to make sense, it needs to pay more than just its capital charge.

380      BOOK 5  Financial Management

» Although you can use EVA analysis to evaluate a business in its entirety, 
EVA analysis isn’t limited to that application. You can use EVA analysis, 
with a little bit of fiddle-faddling, to evaluate a business unit, a particular 
product line, your managers, and so forth.
This is really neat if you think about it. You can use EVA analysis to break your 
business into different profit activities. By using EVA analysis to look at the 
economic profit of these different profit activities, you can probably find those 
activities that should be emphasized because they produce an economic 
profit, and you can identify those activities that should be discontinued 
(perhaps) because they don’t produce an economic profit. You can evaluate 
customers and managers the same way.
If you want to do this more granular EVA analysis, work with a chart of 
accounts that supports more detailed income statements and balance sheets. 
In other words, if you’re going to break your business into two business units, 
use a chart of accounts that lets you easily see the income statement for each 
business unit. In a similar fashion, use a chart of accounts for your balance 
sheet that lets you see the capital investment for both business units. 
Remember that any line item that you want to appear on an income state-
ment or balance sheet needs its own account in the chart of accounts. Book 2, 
Chapter 1 describes how to create your QuickBooks Chart of Accounts list. 
That chapter can also address any questions that you may have about how to 
set up additional income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.
And Now, a Word to My Critics
I may as well admit something here. Some people — I hope only a few — aren’t 
going to like my simplistic approach to EVA.
The following are the points that I simplified, but you can take this information 
and delve deeper into EVA analysis:
»
» More work is involved in this process, per the textbook theory of EVA, 
than what I describe here. In a perfect world, you should take the net 
income number off the QuickBooks income statement and fiddle-faddle with 
it so that you get a better, more accurate, more cash-flow-centric measure 
of income.
»
» Owner’s equity isn’t the world’s greatest measure of the fair market 
value of the capital invested in a firm. It would be great if a firm could 
follow the textbook approach described by the creators of EVA analysis (Stern 
Stewart & Co.) and work with good estimates of the market values of a firm’s 
equity and debt. But you know what? That’s a lot of work for an often-modest 

Economic Value Added 
Analysis
CHAPTER 2  Economic Value Added Analysis      381
increase in precision, especially if you’re paying some consultant the big bucks 
to come up with better market values for your equity and debt.
»
» My rough-and-tumble approach to the capital charge of owner’s equity 
(my suggestion that you simply use a range of values from 15 to 30 percent) 
is sort of financial heresy. MBAs and PhDs probably would be much more 
comfortable using something complicated, such as the capital asset pricing 
model. Unfortunately, that’s a complicated statistical model that, quite truth-
fully, scares me half to death. And yes, you probably could come up with a more 
precise rate of return percentage — if you put in a lot more effort.
So I’m guilty. I admit that I’ve made several simplifications in the EVA model. 
Before the judge passes sentence, however, I want to suggest two extenuating 
circumstances that the judge should consider:
•	 Small-business EVA works differently from big-business EVA. Remember that 
EVA is a tool to help managers think like shareholders. In the case of a 
small-business owner using QuickBooks, however, the manager and the 
shareholder are one person. The dual role implies that this person can more 
loosely apply the EVA model and still get the benefits of EVA-type thinking. 
Some of the machinations involved in very sophisticated EVA analysis stem 
from the fact that management is independent of shareholders. This simply 
not the case with a $1 million manufacturing business or a $10 million 
distribution business.
•	 Precision costs money. Employing someone who’s very sophisticated in the 
wizardry of finance may not be worth the additional cost. Think about the 
typical small-business owner using QuickBooks as his or her accounting 
tool. A firm that produces $10,000 of EVA (as in the examples used in this 
chapter) shouldn’t spend $10,000 or $20,000 on consultants to get a 
super-precise measure of income or the perfect cost of capital measure-
ment. In my opinion, a firm that produces $100,000 in EVA also shouldn’t 
have this expenditure.


CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      383
Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
T
he challenge for any business is allocating capital, or money. Although you 
have limited amounts of capital, your ideas and opportunities are often 
unlimited.
Capital budgeting, in a nutshell, helps you to sift through all these ideas and 
opportunities. Capital budgeting lets you answer questions like the following: 
Should I replace that key piece of machinery that we use in the factory or get a 
new delivery truck? Should we buy the building our offices are in? Or should we 
purchase that competitor’s operation because it’s for sale?
Introducing the Theory of 
Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting boils down to the idea that you should look at capital invest-
ments (machinery, vehicles, real estate, entire businesses, yard art, and so on) 
just as you look at the certificates of deposit (CDs) that a bank offers.

Don’t worry — you actually already know how to do this. When you buy a bank 
CD, you essentially look at one big thing and then a couple of small things to 
decide whether a CD makes sense. The big thing is the interest rate. The two small 
things are the CD maturity and the risk. In the next couple of sections, I talk a bit 
about all three things because they apply so neatly to the problem and challenge 
of capital budgeting.
The big thing is the return
The big thing, as I just mentioned, is the interest rate that a CD pays. You want 
to earn the highest return possible on your money. Therefore, you want a CD that 
pays a high interest rate! A 4 percent interest rate is better than a 2 percent inter-
est rate. And a 6 percent interest rate is way better than a 4 percent interest rate.
You can also look at the interest rates earned on capital investments. Before I go 
any further, though, you should know that interest rates typically don’t go by that 
name in capital investing. For some strange reason, the interest rate that a capital 
investment (such as a piece of machinery, vehicle, or real estate) earns is called a 
return on investment, or a rate of return. But it’s the same thing. The rate of return or 
return on investment (ROI) is really just the interest rate that a capital investment 
or capital expenditure pays.
The return is important because it shows the profitability of the investment, albeit 
as a percentage of the investment. The first thing you need to know about the 
theory of capital budgeting is that the big thing that matters is the return.
One little thing is maturity
The first little thing that you also look at in the case of a CD is the maturity. The 
maturity simply refers to the amount of time that your money gets tied up in the 
investment. You may not want a one-month CD, for example. That short matu-
rity means you have to roll over or reinvest the CD at a new, perhaps lower, rate 
of return in a month. On the other hand, you may want to avoid tying up your 
money for a long period, such as 40 years. Tying up your money for a very long 
period means that you won’t be able to get to the money if a new, better oppor-
tunity comes along. You probably see very few opportunities that are so good, so 
surefire, so long-term that they warrant tying up your money for decades and 
decades, right?
In the case of capital investments, you don’t actually use the word maturity in 
most situations. Instead, you should use a term called liquidity, which simply 
means how close an investment is to cash or how quickly an investment returns 
or pays back the cash that you’ve invested.

Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      385
You can measure liquidity in a bunch of ways. A little later in the chapter, 
I talk about one simple approach to measuring liquidity: the payback period. 
The key thing to remember about liquidity is this: Liquidity isn’t as important 
as ROI. Remember, the return shows profitability. Nevertheless, you do want to 
think about the liquidity of a capital investment. What you think depends on your 
circumstances. In different circumstances, you prefer capital investments with 
different degrees of liquidity.
Another little thing is risk
With CDs, government insurance programs such as the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) reduce the risk of investing. But the risks still matter, right? If 
you’re over the limits of insurance coverage, you don’t put all your money in the 
same bank. Even if you’re under the FDIC insurance limits, you don’t put money 
in a bank that’s at risk of going under. Do that, and you’ll have the hassle of get-
ting your money back.
Typically, you also carefully select CD-like investments, such as debentures, 
which some finance companies offer to CD investors. Again, that makes sense. 
Risk — the chance that maybe you won’t be repaid or that maybe not all your 
interest will be repaid — is one of the things that you want to consider when you 
talk about CDs.
In the same way that risk matters to CDs, risk matters to capital investments. In 
fact, risk probably matters more in the latter case. No government agency guar-
antees that some capital investment will deliver the returns that you plan on. For 
this reason, you must consider the risk of capital investments. You can consider 
risk both quantitatively (which means using measurements that produce values 
that measure the risk) and qualitatively (which means relying on your gut).
The bottom line
The bottom line is this: You actually already know the theory of capital budgeting; 
it works like picking a CD down at the local bank. You want to look at the profit-
ability of the investment by somehow measuring the return on the investment, or 
the interest rate. Profitability isn’t the only consideration, however. If you look at 
a capital expenditure, you also consider the liquidity of the investment. Likewise, 
you take into account the risk of the investment.
Stated in a slightly different way, when you make capital investments, you want 
to invest in things that pay the highest return. But you also want to recognize the 
importance of liquidity, not to mention the risk. You get the theory now, right?

386      BOOK 5  Financial Management
The difference with capital budgeting, then, is that you (rather than the bank 
issuing the CD) need to calculate the return, quantify or measure the liquidity, and 
think carefully about the risks. That’s really it. You just do those three additional 
things, which — surprise, surprise — I discuss next in this chapter.
Calculating the Rate of Return on Capital
I can tell you right up front that calculating the rate of return on a capital invest-
ment is a little bit tricky. In almost every case, you need either a financial cal-
culator (a good one) or a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. For the 
purpose of this discussion, I assume that you have (or have access to) Excel. If you 
don’t have Excel, you should still be able to read almost all the following discus-
sion and then translate what I talk about into the instructions that you need to use 
a financial calculator or some other spreadsheet program. Note that the spread-
sheet mechanics that I describe aren’t very difficult.
If you aren’t all that comfortable with the notion of using Excel — even though 
it’s already installed on your computer — check out Appendix A in Book 8. It pro-
vides a crash course on Excel. You may also want to think about getting a copy of 
Excel For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). Just make sure you 
pick up the edition that talks about your specific version of Excel. If you’re run-
ning Excel 2013, for example, make sure that you get Excel 2013 For Dummies.
Calculating a rate of return on a capital expenditure requires three steps:
1.	 Calculate the investment amount.
2.	 Estimate the net cash flows paid by the investment.
3.	 Use a financial calculator (such as one of those fancy Hewlett-Packard 
calculators) or a spreadsheet program (such as Excel) to calculate the 
rate of return measure.
In the next sections, I explain each of these steps.
If you can, use a spreadsheet program rather than go the fancy-calculator route; 
such calculators can be less than user-friendly. Slightly more than three decades 
ago, when I was graduating with an MBA in finance from the University of Wash-
ington, the joke among many young MBAs was that the ability to calculate the 
rate of return measures on a Hewlett-Packard 12C calculator was worth $40,000 a 
year. The slogan, in fact, was “40G for a 12C.”

Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      387
Calculating the investment amount
The first step in calculating a return is estimating the amount that you need to 
invest. This amount is similar to the check you write to a bank to buy a CD.
Suppose that you’re considering the purchase of a new office building. Just to keep 
everything really simple, suppose that you can buy a building that would house 
your offices for $350,000. Further suppose that you can finance $300,000 of this 
purchase with a mortgage from your friendly local bank. You also need to pay 
closing costs that equal $15,000.
Table 3-1 shows the initial investment that you must make to invest in a new office 
building. The bottom-line amount is $65,000. The table shows how this amount 
gets calculated. The formula is pretty simple: The building costs $350,000, and 
you must pay $15,000 in closing costs. That totals $365,000. The bank, however, 
will finance $300,000 of this amount. This means that you need to come up with 
$65,000 out of your own pocket.
Make sure that you understand why the initial investment, or the first check that 
you need to write, is $65,000. This is the investment that you make in the building.
Estimating the net cash flows
The process of estimating the net cash flows from the investment requires a bit 
more work than the previous exercise did. Sit down and think carefully about any 
additional revenue and any additional costs that the investment produces. Obvi-
ously, you hope that the net effect of the investment will save you cash. Certain 
amounts of the investment will cost you, however. On the other hand, you receive 
savings that the investment returns.
You want to construct a little schedule — you can write it on the back of a cocktail 
napkin or type it in a spreadsheet program like Excel — and use it to carefully 
estimate and calculate cash flows.

388      BOOK 5  Financial Management
Suppose, in the case of the office building, that the following two items deter-
mine the net cash flows:
»
» The new mortgage requires an annual $21,000 interest payment. To keep 
things simple (don’t worry about principal amortization just yet), suppose that 
this mortgage is interest-only. Further suppose that you need to pay the entire 
mortgage balance in 20 years as part of a balloon payment. In the meantime, 
however, you’ll pay $21,000 at the end of every year.
»
» Because you own your own building, you save $20,000 in rent the first 
year. This amount, however, increases every year. If the rent that you’ve been 
paying has increased every year by 3 percent because of inflation, you may 
want to assume that your rent savings, to be accurately forecasted, should be 
inflated by 3 percent every year as well. You may want to assume that in the 
second year, your rent savings equal 103 percent of $20,000. In the third year, 
your rent savings equal 103 percent of $20,600 (which is the second year’s 
rent savings).
Does this business of rent savings make sense? With capital expenditure invest-
ment, the capital investment often saves you money in some way. Therefore, you 
need to estimate those savings over the years that you’ll use the capital invest-
ment. In this case, the rent savings should be equal to the current rent savings 
plus inflation for each year. Another way to look at the rent savings amount is to 
say that the rent savings equals the rent that you won’t have to pay if you own the 
building.
Table 3-2 summarizes the cash flows that you enjoy by investing in this building. 
The table has a column for each year number. (The schedule shows 20 years of 
rent savings and mortgage payments.) The schedule also includes three columns, 
which report on the rent savings, the annual mortgage interest payment, and the 
net cash flow amount. The net cash flow amount equals the rent savings minus 
the mortgage interest payment. Notice that in the first two years, the mortgage 
interest payment exceeds the rent savings. In year 3 and beyond, however, the 
rent savings exceeds the mortgage payment.
Just to make sure you understand the information shown in Table  3-2, take a 
peek at the information estimated for year 17. What does it mean? For year 17, the 
schedule shows that the rent savings equal $32,095. In other words, this sched-
ule estimates that in year 17 of building ownership, you save $32,095 by owning 
the building. This is the amount that you’re guessing you would have had to pay 
in rent to a landlord had you not purchased the building. You also have to pay 
$21,000 in interest on that $300,000 mortgage in year 17. The net savings that 
you accrue, which is the net cash flow in year 17, equals $11,095. This is simply 
the net amount left over from the rent savings after paying the mortgage interest.

Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      389
I need to add one other important wrinkle to the information shown in Table 3-2. 
When you look at the cash flows that stem from a capital investment, you need to 
make some assumption about what happens at the end of the investment’s life. 
In the case of the building investment, for example, you probably need to show 
that the mortgage is paid off. You also may want to show the sale of the building 
at some point.
To show you how this works, suppose that at the end of year 20, you pay off 
the mortgage (which will still be $300,000 because you have been paying only 
interest), and suppose that you sell the building for $630,000. This amount is an

estimate. To come up with this estimate, I took the original $350,000 purchase 
price and annually inflated that amount by 3 percent over 20 years. Doing so pro-
duces an estimated sale price in year 20 of $630,000. You’ll also pay selling costs 
that total $30,000.
Table 3-3 shows how these numbers produce a final, liquidation cash flow. The 
gross sales price equals $630,000, as mentioned earlier. Then you have to pay 
the $300,000 mortgage. You also have $30,000 in selling costs. If you subtract 
the mortgage and the selling costs from the gross sales price, the final cash  
flow, then, equals $300,000. This makes sense, right? The gross sales price of 
$630,000 minus $300,000 for the mortgage payment minus $30,000 for selling 
costs equals $300,000.
The final step is to combine the information shown in Tables  3-2 and  3-3.  
Table 3-4 does this. The net cash flows column summarizes the net cash flows 
from Table 3-2. The liquidation cash flow column shows 0 during the first 19 years. 
In year 20, however, the liquidation cash flow shows as $300,000. The real deal 
combines the net cash flows and the liquidation cash flow.
Just to make sure that you understand the Real Deal column’s numbers, I’ll go 
into detail about a couple of them. Start by looking at year 5. For year 5, the table 
shows a net cash flow of $1,511, no liquidation cash flow, and an actual cash flow 
to you, the business owner, of $1,511. If this building weren’t a building but was 
really a CD, this is the amount of interest that the CD would pay you for year 5.
In year 20, things look a bit different. The net cash flow equals $14,072 when you 
combine the rent savings and the mortgage interest. The sale of the building at the 
end of the year also produces a $300,000 cash flow. This is actually the amount 
that you’d receive from the escrow company after the sale of the building closes. 
The net or final cash flow that you receive, then, combines these two amounts: the 
$14,072 of net cash flow and the $300,000 of liquidation cash flow. This cash flow 
is like the accrued interest being paid back by the bank on a CD.

And now the hard part is done. You essentially turned your building investment 
into just another set of cash flows. These cash flows look to a financial calculator 
or spreadsheet program like just another investment. In fact, these cash flows 
could describe some crazy 20-year CD investment. In this case, of course, they 
describe an imaginary building investment. But they could be the cash flows from 
any investment: a new piece of machinery, a corporate jet, or a new delivery truck.
Calculating the return
As I mention previously in this chapter, I’m going to show you the two basic ways 
that you can calculate a return by using Microsoft Excel. (I use Excel because

it’s so ubiquitous.) You can, however, use another spreadsheet program, such as 
Google Docs, Apache OpenOffice Calc, or any high-powered financial business 
calculator. Basically, if you understand the logic of the stuff described here, you 
should be able to translate what I say into Lotus 1-2-3 speak or Hewlett-Packard 
business calculator speak.
To calculate a rate of return with Microsoft Excel, you first enter the cash flows 
produced by the investment. In Figure 3-1, I’ve created a simple Excel worksheet 
that does just this. Even if you’ve never used Excel before, you may be able to con-
struct this worksheet; all you have to do is start Excel (the same way you start any 
other Windows program). Then you enter the cash flows shown for the building 
investment. Actually, you enter only the values shown in cells B2, B3, B4, B5, and 
so on, through cell B22. These values are the cash flow numbers calculated and 
summarized in Table 3-4 earlier in this chapter. (Flip back and look at Table 3-4 
if you don’t see this clearly.)
By the way, in case you’re new to Excel, all you do to enter one of these values is 
click the box (technically called a cell), and then type the value. To enter the ini-
tial investment required to buy the building — $65,000 — you click the B2 cell 
and then type -65000. After you type this number, press Enter. You enter each 
of the other net cash flow values in the same manner to make the rate-of-return 
calculations.
FIGURE 3-1:

worksheet that

cash flows.

in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      393
I also put in values to label the years and then added a little bit of text in A1 and 
B1 to identify what the labels are. You don’t have to enter those extraneous bits of 
information, however.
After you provide the cash flow values of the investment, you tell Excel the rate 
of return that you want calculated. In Figure 3-1, I actually calculate two rates of 
return. In cell G4, for example, I calculate an internal rate of return. An internal 
rate of return (IRR) is the interest rate that the investment delivers. A CD that pays 
an 11 percent interest rate, for example, pays an 11 percent internal rate of return. 
To calculate an internal rate of return, you enter an internal rate of return func-
tion formula in a worksheet cell. In the case of the worksheet shown in Figure 3-1, 
for example, you click cell G4 and then type the following:
=IRR(B2:B22,.1)
If you’ve never seen an Excel function before, this probably looks like Greek. But 
all this function does is tell Excel to calculate the internal rate of return for the 
cash flows stored in the range, or block of cells, that goes from cell B2 to cell 
B22. The .1 is my initial guess about the IRR; you provide that value so that Excel 
has a starting point for calculating the return. The office-building cash flows, it 
turns out, produce an internal rate of return equal to 11 percent. This means that 
essentially, the office building delivers an 11 percent interest rate annually on the 
amounts invested in it.
Another common rate of return measure is something called a net present value, 
which essentially specifies the dollar amount by which the rate of return on a 
business exceeds a benchmark rate of return. The worksheet shown in Figure 3-1 
shows the net present value equal to $9,821.71. In other words, this investment 
exceeds a benchmark rate of return by $9,821.71. You can’t see it — it’s buried in 
the formula — but the benchmark rate of return equals 10 percent. So this rate of 
return essentially is $9,821.71 better than a 10 percent rate of return.
To calculate the net present value by using Excel, you use another function. In the 
case of the worksheet shown in Figure 3-1, for example, you click cell G6 and type 
the following formula:
=NPV(0.1,B3:B22)+B2
This formula looks at the cash flows for years 1 through 20; discounts these cash 
flows by using a 10 percent rate of return; and then compares these discounted 
cash flows with the initial investment amount, which is the value stored in cell B2.
All this may sound a bit tricky, but essentially, this is what’s going on: The net 
present value formula looks at the cash flows stored in the worksheet and calcu-
lates the present value amount by which these cash flows exceed a 10 percent rate 
of return.

SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE IRR 
MEASUREMENT
I kind of like the internal rate of return (IRR) measurement because it makes a lot of 
intuitive sense. Capital budgeting is burdensome enough without being weighed down 
further by some tricky, abstract, theoretical capital budgeting tool such as the net 
­present value.
You should know, however, that the internal rate of return has some practical weak-
nesses, which is why people with MBAs and PhDs in business and finance greatly prefer 
the net present value measure. In this sidebar, I identify these weaknesses for you. 
Knowing about the weaknesses enables you to more safely use the IRR tool. On the 
other hand, knowing about the weaknesses may also make you choose to just bear with 
the abstractness of the net present value model and use it instead. Anyway, here are 
the weaknesses:
•	 The IRR measure doesn’t always identify the best investment. In other words, 
you sometimes can’t pick the investment with the highest IRR and get the most 
profitable investment. As an extreme example, suppose that you have $100,000 to 
invest. Would you rather invest only $10,000 of your money in something earning 
20 percent annually or look at something earning 18 percent annually in which you 
can invest the entire $100,000? Do you see the difference? Twenty percent of 
$10,000 isn’t going to be as good as 18 percent of $100,000. Unfortunately, the IRR 
measure — by focusing on the percentage return — sometimes causes people to 
lose sight of the dollars of profit, which obviously is what you really want to maxi-
mize. By comparison, the net present value does calculate a straight dollar profit 
amount. By picking an investment with the highest net present value, you’re picking 
the investment that delivers the most dollars and profits.
•	 The IRR measure doesn’t recognize reinvestment risk very well. This sounds 
like another mumbo-jumbo problem, but it’s actually a pretty important one. 
Suppose that you have a million dollars to invest. Would you rather pick a 1-year 
investment (Option A) that earns 30 percent or a 20-year investment (Option B) that 
earns 20 percent? At first blush, a 30 percent investment seems like a pretty good 
one. Obviously, 30 percent is a lot more than 20 percent. Here’s what you have to 
consider, however: Where are you going to invest the money from Option A one 
year from now, when that investment liquidates? The key is that you have to be 
able to invest the $1.3 million (which is what you get from Option A one year from 
now) in something that beats the Option B investment. In other words, you have to 
think about that reinvestment risk for your investments. The IRR doesn’t really do 
this. By comparison, the net present value does. Implicitly, the net present value 
assumes that you can reinvest money at the discount rate used in the calculation. 
In essence, the discount rate is the going rate that you can earn on your other capi-
tal investments, so it automatically factors in reinvestment.

Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      395
The discount rate equals the rate of return that you expect on your capital invest-
ments. I should also note that the discount rate is the rate at which you can rein-
vest any money you get from the capital investment’s cash flows.
One final comment about the information shown in Figure 3-1 (this is also true of 
the information from Table 3-4): In this figure, I describe how to calculate pre-
tax cash flows and, therefore, how to calculate a pre-tax rate of return measure. 
In some situations, however, you may want to calculate an after-tax set of cash 
flows and an after-tax rate of return. If taxes are a significant factor, and if you’re 
considering alternative capital investments that deliver different tax benefits, you 
can get more precise and sometimes different results by looking at after-tax cash 
flows and after-tax rates of return. If you do want to look at after-tax cash flows 
and profitability measures, you probably need the help of your tax adviser.
An important thing to know about pre-tax cash flows and returns versus after-tax 
cash flows and returns: Make sure that you’re using apples-to-apples compari-
sons. It’s often fine to work with pre-tax cash flows; just make sure that you’re 
comparing pre-tax cash flows with other pre-tax cash flows. You don’t want to 
compare pre-tax returns with after-tax returns. That’s an apples-to-oranges 
comparison. Predictably, it doesn’t work.
•	 The IRR measure doesn’t always produce a solution or a unique solution.  
The IRR formula isn’t solvable, for example, when the cash flows don’t really look 
like investment cash flows. If you have an investment that generates cash only 
because there’s no initial cash outlay, you can’t calculate an internal rate of return. 
But such an investment, obviously, is a very good deal that you should select.  
A related problem is that sometimes, the IRR formula can’t be uniquely solved. This 
business about no unique solution stems from a little bit of mathematical weird-
ness. (The problem is that technically, an IRR formula is an nth root polynomial 
equation with up to nth possible solutions!) This multiple-solutions weirdness pops 
up when you have the cash flow signs changing over the years that the investment 
is held. In the case of the office-building investment, only one sign change exists. In 
year 2, the cash flow is negative. And in year 3, the cash flow becomes positive and 
stays positive. This means that the building has one single internal rate of return. If 
in some years the cash flow was positive and in some years the cash flow was nega-
tive, however, each of these flips from negative to positive cash value, or vice versa, 
indicating another solution to the IRR formula. I won’t go into any more detail, but 
the important point is that by using the net present value formula, you always know 
that a solution exists and that it’s the single unique solution, given a particular dis-
count rate.

396      BOOK 5  Financial Management
Measuring Liquidity
In large businesses, people don’t worry or talk much about liquidity — at least 
when it comes to capital investments. Liquidity as a criterion for looking at capi-
tal investments is downplayed. The logic behind this is that in most cases, very 
large firms have almost unlimited access to capital through the capital markets 
(the stock markets, the debt markets, or even just big-time borrowing from enor-
mous banks). For many smaller businesses, however, liquidity is important. You 
can make only a limited number of investments. Additionally, you have a limited 
amount of capital — less than you like, almost always. New opportunities and 
ways to invest your money continually arrive. For these reasons, you typically 
want to look at the liquidity of your capital investments.
One easy way to measure liquidity is with a payback period, which measures what 
it takes for an investment to pay back its original investment. The office-building 
example doesn’t work very well for this sort of calculation, so to make things a 
little easier, suppose that you’re considering a $10,000 investment that produces 
$2,000 a year in net cash flows. In this case, you can calculate the payback period 
with the following formula:
Payback period = initial investment/annual cash flow
In the case of the $10,000 investment described here, the actual formula is
$10,000/$2,000 = 5
This means that the $10,000 investment, through its $2,000-per-year cash flows, 
takes five years to pay back.
Again, you don’t want to focus on liquidity. Liquidity is almost never as impor-
tant as profitability. But even though profitability is paramount, liquidity is often 
something that you want to consider. At times, you’re going to want investments 
that pay back more quickly rather than those that pay back less quickly. When the 
investments do pay off, you’ll have other good reinvestment opportunities.
Thinking about Risk
Obviously, risk matters. Risk is an issue even with simple investments like bank 
CDs. But with capital investments, no government agency is looking out for your 
interest and picking up the pieces if things do a Humpty Dumpty and come crash-
ing down.

Capital Budgeting 
in a Nutshell
CHAPTER 3  Capital Budgeting in a Nutshell      397
So think for a minute about risk management and assessment in the case of capi-
tal expenditures. Here are three important comments that I can share:
»
» Be very careful and thoughtful in coming up with cash flows. The better 
job that you do of thinking about and estimating the cash flows from a capital 
expenditure, the more reliable and useful your results are. Good cash flow 
estimates produce good rate of return measurements. Look back to the 
examples shown in Tables 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4 earlier in this chapter.
»
» Experiment. You absolutely need to experiment with your assumptions. 
Make changes, and see how those changes affect both the cash flow and 
rate-of-return measurements. Looking back at the cash flow information 
shown earlier in Tables 3-3 and 3-4, for example, you can see that the single 
biggest cash flow in the building investment is the resale amount in year 20. It 
would be very interesting to see what effect a lower inflation, or appreciation, 
rate has on the ultimate rate of return. A 2 percent inflation rate would 
dramatically change the cash flows and the rate of return measurement for 
this investment. Similarly, an inflation rate of 5 percent or 6 percent over 
those 20 years would dramatically change things. In the former case, things 
get ugly, quickly. In the latter case, well, we all remember how good a 
leveraged real estate investment can be when given high, continued inflation 
rates, right?
»
» Think about the discount rate that you use. I don’t spend a lot of time 
talking about the discount rate, but you should implicitly take into consider-
ation the risk that an investment makes you face. My finance professor always 
said, “Your discount rate should equal the rate of return that similarly risky 
investments produce.” There’s tremendous wisdom in this simple guideline. 
(Thanks, Professor Schall!) In other words, if you’re looking at a very risky 
investment, you should compare that investment with the hoped-for higher 
rates of return that other, similarly risky investments deliver. You’d never pick 
an investment that, given its risk level, delivers an inferior rate of return. At the 
same time, if you’re looking at lower-risk investments, you want to use a lower 
discount rate. A relatively low-risk investment in something like an office 
building, for example, shouldn’t be evaluated with a discount rate that may be 
appropriate for some super-risky investment in some new bit of leading-edge 
technology.
You want to try some different discount rates. By experimenting not only with 
your cash flow numbers, but also with your discount rates, you can see how the 
quality of an investment changes when you use different discount rates (and 
implicitly make different assumptions about the investment’s risk).

398      BOOK 5  Financial Management
What Does All of This Have to Do 
with QuickBooks?
So here’s a question: What does all this capital budgeting stuff have to do with 
QuickBooks?
Well, quite honestly, capital budgeting really doesn’t relate directly to using 
QuickBooks. In some ways, capital budgeting is about a financial management 
task that’s critically important and that you need to think about . . . but it’s a task 
that QuickBooks doesn’t directly support.
That said, do note that much of the data that you’ve collected with QuickBooks is 
often extremely useful for getting good estimates of the savings and costs associ-
ated with some capital expenditure.
In looking at the example of investing in an office building, for example, knowing 
what you’ve been paying in rent and what you may be able to save by buying your 
own building is exactly the sort of information that you need — and exactly the 
sort of information that the rich financial database of QuickBooks supplies.
In truth, your estimates of cash flows typically are much more involved than what 
I show in this chapter. If you do have a building investment under consideration, 
you should consider all sorts of expenses related to repairing and maintaining the 
building. If you’ve been leasing space in someone else’s building, you have to con-
sider all sorts of expenses associated with that, including special insurance that 
the landlord makes you buy, special amounts that you spend because the space 
doesn’t quite meet your requirements, and so on. QuickBooks helps you with this 
type of information.

CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      401
Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
P
rofit-volume-cost analysis is a powerful tool that estimates how a business’s 
profits change as its sales volumes change, as well as break-even points. 
(A break-even point is the sales revenue level that produces zero profits.)
Profit-volume-cost analysis often produces surprising results. Typically, the 
analysis shows that small changes in a business’s sales volume produce big 
changes in profits.
Hotels and airlines are types of businesses that often see surprising fluctuations 
in their profits based on relatively modest changes in their sales revenue. Indeed, 
now that you know this, you’ll probably notice that investment analysts often use 
small changes in hotel occupancy and in airline load factors (the percentage of 
seats filled on a plane) to explain big changes in profits.
The first part of this chapter talks about the theory of profit-volume-cost analy-
sis. Understanding the theory may be all you need to apply this tool to your spe-
cific setting. At the end of the chapter, I describe a Microsoft Excel workbook that

you can use for more sophisticated profit-volume-cost analysis. That workbook

content/uploads/profit_volume_cost-1.xlsx.
Seeing How Profit-Volume-Cost  
Analysis Works
Profit-volume-cost analysis uses three pieces of information to show how your 
profits change as sales revenue changes: estimates of your sales revenue, your 
gross margin percentage, and your fixed costs. Usually, all three items of data are 
easy to come by.
Suppose that you’re a builder of high-end racing sailboats that sell for $100,000 
each. Further suppose that each boat costs you $40,000 in labor and material and 
that your shop costs $160,000 a year to keep open.
You can calculate your gross margin percentage by using the following formula:
(boat sales price - direct labor and material costs) ÷ (boat sales cost)
Or you can use the actual numbers from my example:
($100,000 - $40,000) ÷ ($100,000)
This formula returns the result 0.6, or 60 percent. In this case, your fixed cost 
amount equals $160,000.
With the fixed cost and gross margin percentage information, you can calculate 
the profits that different sales revenues produce. To make this calculation, you use 
the following formula:
profits = (sales × gross margin percentage) - fixed cost
Table 1-1 shows some examples of how you can use this formula to estimate the 
profits at different sales volume levels. At $200,000 in annual sales, for exam-
ple, the business suffers a $40,000 loss. At $300,000 in sales, the business earns 
a $20,000 profit. At $400,000  in sales, the business earns an $80,000 profit. 
Table 1-1 also shows the formula used to estimate profits.

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      403
The really interesting thing about the information shown in Table 1-1 — and 
I don’t want to beat a dead horse here — is that profits often change more signifi-
cantly than revenue changes. Look at Table 1-1, and examine what happens when 
revenue increases from $300,000 to $400,000 — roughly a 33 percent increase. 
You see that profits quadruple from $20,000 to $80,000.
Here’s another way to look at the estimated profits at the $300,000 and $400,000 
sales levels: If sales drop by 25 percent from $400,000 to $300,000, profits 
decrease by 75 percent from $80,000 to $20,000.
Table 1-1 illustrates a common experience of businesses. Relatively modest 
changes in sales revenue produce large — sometimes stunningly large — changes 
in profits. The reason that you perform profit-volume-cost analysis, therefore, 
is to understand how sensitive your business profits are to changes in sales vol-
ume. With this information, you can understand how important it is to prevent 
decreases in sales, and you can reap the rewards of increasing sales.
I need to make one final point about the information shown in Table 1-1: You can 
calculate this same information, almost in longhand fashion, by using miniature 
income statements. Table 1-2, for example, shows some miniature income state-
ments that calculate profits at various sales levels.

It’s no coincidence that the miniature income statements shown in Table  1-2 
produce the same estimates of profit as the formulas shown in Table  1-1. The 
difference  — and the advantage of the approach to information illustrated in 
Table 1-1 — is that the formula makes it possible to quickly calculate estimates 
of profits at any sales level. Constructing even a miniature income statement like 
the one shown in Table 1-2 is typically more work than using the approach shown 
in Table 1-1.
Calculating Break-Even Points
Here’s another important piece of information that belongs between your ears: 
A common application of the formula used in Table 1-1, earlier in this chapter, is 
to calculate a break-even point. A break-even point, as noted previously, shows the 
sales revenue volume that produces zero profit and zero loss.
Remember the formula for performing profit-volume-cost analysis? It goes like 
this:
profits = (sales revenue × gross margin percentage) - fixed costs
Rather than calculate profits based on the other three variables (sales revenue, 
gross margin percentage, and fixed costs), you can calculate a sales revenue 
amount based on the other three variables (profits, gross margin percentage, and 
fixed costs).
The formula for making such a break-even calculation, based on algebraic manip-
ulation of the profit-volume-cost analysis formula, looks like this:
Break-even point (in sales revenue) = fixed costs ÷ gross margin percentage
To calculate the break-even point in sales revenue for the example boat-building 
business, you make the calculation
$160,000 ÷ 40 percent
which produces the result
$266,667
Accordingly, the boat-building business needs $266,667 of revenue to break even.

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      405
The break-even point formula described in the preceding paragraphs estimates a 
break-even point in revenue. Often, however, such a revenue-based break-even 
point doesn’t make complete sense. In the case of the boat-building business in 
which you sell boats for $100,000 each, there’s no practical way to get $266,667 
of revenue. You can’t sell two thirds of a boat. The correct way to interpret a 
break-even point in revenue in this example, then, is to interpret it as a rough 
break-even point. As a practical matter in the boat-building business, the break-
even point is slightly less than three boats per year.
If, in this example, you were working with boats that cost $1,000 each or $100 
each, the precision of the break-even point would be much greater. If you man-
ufactured day-sailor boats that cost $1,000 apiece, you would know that the 
CONFUSED ABOUT THE BREAK-EVEN POINT 
FORMULA?
The formula for calculating the break-even point seems pretty different from the for-
mula for calculating profit-volume-cost information — or at least it does at first blush. 
But the second formula is derived from the first. Because some compulsive readers 
may want to know how this variation works, I show it to you in this sidebar.
Here’s the fixed base formula:
profits = (sales revenue × gross margin percentage) - fixed 
costs
If I subtract the fixed costs from both sides of the formula, I get the following:
profits - fixed costs = sales revenue × gross margin percentage
Because profits equal zero at the break-even point, I can simplify this formula further by 
just scratching out the profits variable, as shown here:
-fixed costs = sales revenue × gross margin percentage
If I divide both sides of the equation by the gross margin percentage, I get the basic 
break-even point formula, as shown here:
-fixed costs × gross margin percentage = sales revenue
And that’s the way the formula gets created. Essentially, all you have to do is divide the 
fixed-costs amount by the gross margin percentage. The result shows the sales revenue 
at which a firm breaks even.

406      BOOK 6  Business Plans
break-even point is somewhere between 266 and 267 boats (calculated by dividing 
the $266,667 of revenue by $1,000). If the boats cost $100 each — perhaps they’re 
model boats — you know that the break-even point is between 2,666 model boats 
and 2,667 model boats (calculated by dividing the revenue amount by $100).
In either case, you see that the smaller the revenue per unit, the more precision 
you get in the break-even point in units.
You can also see from this example that the process of converting a break-even 
point in revenue to a break-even point in units is simply a matter of dividing the 
break-even point in revenue by the unit price.
Using Real QuickBooks Data for  
Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis
As noted previously, you need three items of data to perform profit-volume-cost 
analysis: sales revenue, gross margin percentage, and fixed cost. Typically, these 
items of data aren’t difficult to find if you’ve been using QuickBooks. Neverthe-
less, this data doesn’t map perfectly to line items that appear in a QuickBooks 
income statement. For this reason, I briefly discuss how you come up with these 
pieces of information.
Sales revenue
The sales revenue levels that you use in the formula are the sales revenue levels 
that you want to experiment with. They probably represent possible — or maybe 
even likely — sales revenue levels for your business. Accordingly, the sales rev-
enue levels don’t really come from QuickBooks. You may want to look at past 
income statements to determine reasonable or likely sales revenue levels. The 
formula inputs are probably just rough estimates, however; they don’t actually 
come from a QuickBooks income statement.
Gross margin percentage
The gross margin percentage, as illustrated previously, is calculated by subtracting 
your variable costs from your sales revenue and then dividing that result (which is 
the gross margin) by the sales revenue. The variable costs include the costs of the 
items that you sell: inventory, commissions, shipping, and similar costs.

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      407
Because calculating the gross margin percentage can be a little bit confusing the 
first few times you do it, here are a couple of examples to review:
»
» Boat building: If you sell $100,000 boats, and the material, labor, and 
commission expenses for each boat total $40,000, you can calculate the gross 
margin percentage by using the formula
($100,000 - $40,000) ÷ $100,000
That formula returns 0.6, or 60 percent, which is the gross margin percentage 
of the boat-building business.
»
» Tax return service: For another example, assume that you’re running a 
personal service business in which you prepare tax returns for a living. Further 
assume that you charge $200 for a small-business tax return and that the only 
variable cost is a $40 fee that you have to pay to the tax software company for 
the return. In this case, you calculate the gross margin percentage by using 
the formula
($200 - $40) ÷ $200
This formula returns the value 0.8, or 80 percent. In this case, 80 percent is the 
gross margin percentage for your tax return preparation business.
The key point is that variable costs vary with the sales revenue. If a sale occurs, 
the sale produces variable costs. If no sale occurs, no variable costs are incurred.
So what does all this mean? Well, typically, the variable costs equal the cost of 
goods sold (COGS) number that’s shown on your QuickBooks income statement. 
This COGS number probably includes the inventory items that you sell (if you’re 
in a business in which you resell inventory) and other items, such as freight and 
sales commissions. Therefore, you can get most or all the variable cost informa-
tion right off the QuickBooks income statement.
You may need to fiddle with the COGS amount reported in the QuickBooks income 
statement. Remember that variable costs are those costs that vary with sales, and 
as a result, some of the costs that you’ve included in the COGS section of your 
income statement may not be variable. Some of the costs reported in the regular 
operating-expenses portion of your income statement are actually variable.
Therefore, you may want to think about the costs reported in the COGS section and 
in the operating expenses section of your income statement. If you realize that 
the COGS value isn’t a good estimate of variable costs, make some adjustments. 
A fixed cost that’s included in COGS number should be subtracted, obviously. And 
a variable cost that’s included with the other operating expenses may need to be 
added to the COGS number.

408      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Fixed costs
Fixed costs include all your other nonvariable costs. In a nutshell, fixed costs are 
fixed because they don’t change with sales volume. Fixed costs include items such 
as rent paid on an office or factory, salaries paid to permanent employees, over-
head for insurance, and so forth.
To see how fixed costs work and get calculated, return to the examples of the 
boat-building business and the tax return preparation service:
»
» In the boat-building business, the firm carries overhead of more than 
$160,000. This amount may include $80,000 for the shop in which you build 
your boats and $80,000 for the salaries that you pay to two craftsmen whom 
you continue to employ whether or not you have boats to build. In this case, 
then, these overhead costs constitute your $160,000 of fixed costs. These 
fixed costs don’t change based on changes in sales volume.
»
» In the tax return service, your only fixed expenses are $100 a month for 
yellow-pages advertisements and $700 a month to rent a small office. In this 
case, then, your fixed costs equal $800 a month. Again, these fixed costs don’t 
change based on changes in sales volume.
Recognizing the Downside of  
the Profit-Volume-Cost Model
Okay, this stuff all sounds fine and good, but what happens when little reserva-
tions start to pop up? Annoying little problems? Minor weaknesses that turn into 
irritations?
Here’s the problem: Like any abstract explanation of reality, the profit-volume- 
cost model isn’t perfect. If you want to get nitpicky  — and you should for a 
moment — several practical problems creep into the calculations of the profit- 
volume-cost formula and its application to your real-life business affairs. I ­discuss 
these problems in the following list, but I don’t think that having such problems 
means that you shouldn’t use the model. They only change the way that you work 
with the model.
»
» Any assumptions that you make about variable costs and fixed costs 
typically apply only over a range of sales revenue. In the boat-building 
business, for example, the numbers used in the preceding sections don’t 
apply if the boat builder scales up and builds 500 boats a year. That’s obvious, 

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      409
right? It may be that the range of sales revenue valid for a 60 percent gross 
margin percentage — and, therefore, $160,000 of fixed costs — is really 
somewhere between 0 boats per year and 8 boats per year. Move to a sales 
revenue level above 8 boats a year, and very likely, either the gross margin 
percentage or the fixed cost amount changes.
»
» In the super-long run, as a practical matter, there’s no such thing as a 
fixed cost. Essentially, every cost is variable. In the boat-building business, for 
example, you could — in the long run — lay off two craftsmen and move to a 
smaller shop. Perhaps you could even build boats in your backyard. Fixed 
costs, in other words, are fixed only for a particular period of time. If you 
move beyond that period of time, the fixed costs are no longer fixed. This 
seems like an obvious point, but it’s important to recognize.
»
» In the super-short term, there’s no such thing as a variable cost. (Or at 
least there aren’t very many variable costs.) In the boat-building business, 
even if you pay your laborers an hourly wage for building the boats, you 
probably can’t send the laborers home early just because work for the day 
is done. You can’t tell your laborers at the end of Tuesday not to come in 
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday just because you have no work for them. 
Other variable costs may work the same way — not always, but sometimes. 
In any case, recognize that some costs may vary over a month or year but not 
over a day or a week. In other words, in the super-short term, variable costs 
often aren’t very variable.
The three preceding conundrums indicate that profit-volume-cost analysis suf-
fers some limits. You can’t use a gross margin percentage and a fixed cost amount 
for just any sales revenue estimates; you use those two items of data for a carefully 
considered range of sales revenue volumes. Furthermore, you can’t use profit- 
volume-cost analysis for super-short time frames. Variable costs in that case 
aren’t really variable. And you can’t use profit-volume-cost analysis for super-
long time frames because in the long run, no fixed cost stays fixed.
To generalize, the profit-volume-cost analysis tool provides rough measurements. 
These rough measurements can be very useful to you, but they’re really just rough 
measurements. Always apply common sense when using profit-volume-cost 
analysis.
Maybe it’s only a little game I play with myself, but sometimes, I don’t think 
about fixed costs and variable costs. Instead, I think about sort-of fixed costs and 
sort-of variable costs. By admitting up front that the fixed costs aren’t always sol-
idly fixed and that the variable costs aren’t always solidly variable, I find myself 
getting more comfortable with the profit-volume-cost analysis formula. I remind 
myself that the model isn’t perfect — only a rough tool to estimate profit and 
break-even points.

Using the Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis Workbook
I’ve created a Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook for you in case you want 
to perform more sophisticated profit-volume-cost analysis. This workbook is 
available on my website at http://stephenlnelson.com/wp-content/uploads/
profit_volume_cost-1.xlsx.
The Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook uses an Excel 2007-2016 file format. 
This means you can open and use the workbook with most recent versions of Excel 
(including Excel 2016, which is the version of Excel that I used for this book).
The Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook enables you to estimate profits at 
a variety of sales revenue volumes, to estimate break-even points, and to chart 
break-even and profit-volume-cost data. Some of the calculations are a little bit 
cumbersome, but almost every calculation is simply an extension of what I discuss 
in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter.
In the remaining pages of this chapter, I describe how to use the Profit-Volume- 
Cost Analysis workbook and how to understand and interpret both the break-even 
analysis and the profit-volume-cost analysis performed by the workbook. I also 
share a few words about the charts that graphically depict the profit-volume-cost 
analysis results.
Collecting your inputs
Figure 1-1 shows the worksheet range in which you enter the raw data required 
for the profit-volume-cost analysis. The workbook collects more data points than 
you may expect. Most of this information, however, is simply a slightly more 
granular approach to collecting the three basic inputs that any profit-volume- 
cost analysis depends on: sales revenue estimates, gross margin percentage, and 
fixed costs.
You don’t need to be an Excel expert to use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis 
workbook described in this chapter, but do need to know how to start and stop 
Excel and how to enter values into worksheet cells. If you don’t possess these 
Excel skills, you may want to consider buying and reading a recent edition of Excel 
For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      411
To use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook.
(a)	 Point your browser to http://stephenlnelson.com/wp-content/
uploads/profit_volume_cost-1.xlsx.
(b)	 When your browser asks whether you want to open the file or save the file, 
indicate that you want to save the file to your hard drive.
(c)	 Open the file by starting Microsoft Excel and choosing File ➪ Open.
(d)	 When Excel displays the Open dialog box, open the folder with the profit_
volume_cost.xlsx file and then double-click the file.
2.	 Describe the sales revenue that you want to test.
To do this, you must provide three pieces of information: the unit sales price, 
the low unit sales volume, and the high unit sales volume.
Enter the unit sales price into cell E5. If you sell an item that costs $1,500, for 
example, you enter $1,500 into cell E5. Use the low unit volume tested and 
high unit volume tested inputs shown in cells E6 and E7 (respectively) to 
identify the range of sales volumes that you want to test. The low unit volume 
tested value multiplied by the unit sales price equals the lowest revenue 
volume that the worksheet tests. The high unit volume tested multiplied by the 
unit sales price amount equals the largest sales revenue volume tested.
The three revenue inputs that you collect and input into cells E5, E6, and E7 tell 
the workbook which sales revenue volumes you want to analyze.
If you wanted to use the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis workbook to test sales 
volumes for the boat-building business that I describe earlier in the chapter, 
FIGURE 1-1:  
The inputs 
area of the  
Profit-Volume- 
Cost Analysis 
workbook.

412      BOOK 6  Business Plans
the unit sales price would equal $100,000, so the low unit volume tested may 
equal 2, and the high unit volume may equal 5. These inputs, then, would test 
sales volumes of between $100,000 and $500,000, based on a $100,000 price 
for a boat.
3.	 Describe the variable costs.
When you do real-life profit-volume-cost analysis, you find that your variable 
costs fall into one of two categories: variable costs that can be expressed as an 
amount per unit and variable costs that can be expressed as a percentage of 
the sales price. The worksheet range E10:E18 collects the information needed 
to describe these sorts of variable costs.
The first set of variable costs, which I call vary-with-unit costs, goes into cells E11, 
E12, E13, and E14. Any direct labor costs associated with the item that you’re 
selling go into cell E11. Direct material costs go into E12. Factory overhead costs, 
which are variable and based on units sold, go into cell E13. If you have any other 
vary-with-unit costs, you enter the amount per unit for these costs into cell E14.
The example vary-with-unit cost values shown in Figure 1-1 mean that for each 
unit sold, the assumption is that the business pays $75 per unit in direct labor, 
$40 per unit in direct materials, $400 per unit in factory overhead, and another 
$40 per unit for other vary-with-unit costs. If you add up these amounts, you 
see that vary-with-unit costs equal $555 per unit sold.
In addition to vary-with-unit costs, firms often pay variable costs that are best 
expressed as a percentage of revenue. In the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis 
workbook, the worksheet range E16:E18 supplies space to describe and record 
these variable costs, which I call vary-with-revenue costs. The workbook, for 
example, shows a 5 percent sales commission in cell E16. The workbook shows 
an 8 percent sales tax in cell E17. And just to provide a catch-all category for 
other vary-with-revenue costs, the workbook includes (and I show for purposes 
of this example) another vary-with-revenue costs value in cell E18.
In the case of the sample data set shown in Figure 1-1, for example, vary-with- 
revenue costs equal 14.5 percent of sales.
4.	 Record your fixed costs.
To record or estimate your fixed costs, enter the fixed costs amount into cell 
E20. In Figure 1-1, for example, fixed costs show as $150,000.
5.	 Estimate any variable costs that vary with profits.
Here’s one other wrinkle that you may often encounter with real-life profit- 
volume-cost analysis: variable costs that don’t vary from changes in sales 
revenue but from changes in profits. Some businesses have profit-sharing 
plans, for example. Those profits represent variable costs because they vary 
with changes in sales revenue — sort of. To estimate the profit-sharing costs, 
you need to first calculate profits and then apply the profit-sharing percentage 

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      413
to those profits. Income taxes — federal, state, and local income taxes — also 
fall into the category of variable costs that vary not with changes in sales 
revenue, but with changes in profit.
In the workbook shown in Figure 1-1, I’ve provided three cells — E23, E24, and 
E25 — that let you recognize these variable costs. I call this category of variable 
costs vary-with-profit costs. You can enter the state income tax percentage into 
cell E23. You can enter the federal income tax percentage into cell E43. And if 
you have any other vary-with-profit costs, you can enter the sum of these costs 
as a percentage into cell E25.
I should tell you that vary-with-profit costs are tricky to estimate precisely. The 
trickiness stems from a couple of factors:
»
» Many vary-with-profit costs aren’t simply calculated as percentages of 
profit. The cost calculations are considerably more complicated. Income tax 
costs, for example, don’t use a single percentage. They often use a schedule of 
progressive percentages.
»
» Vary-with-profit costs often interrelate. State income taxes affect federal 
income taxes, for example. Other vary-with-profit costs may interrelate, too. 
A profit-sharing percentage may be applied on an after-tax basis, for example. 
The workbook formulas don’t explicitly recognize any interrelationship between 
these variables. Therefore, to precisely model these vary-with-profit costs, you 
must enter percentages that have been fiddled with a bit, as described in the 
sidebar “Dealing with vary-with-profit costs,” later in this chapter.
After you collect the needed inputs for the Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis 
workbook, the workbook estimates a break-even point and prepares a profit 
volume forecast. The workbook also supplies a couple of useful charts that 
graphically show the break-even and the profit-volume analysis data. The next 
sections of this chapter describe these analysis results.
Understanding the break-even analysis
The break-even analysis that the workbook makes based on the inputs that you 
enter is shown in Figure 1-2 in the worksheet range from B27:E45. The break-
even analysis shows the number of units required to break even in cell E28 and 
the sales revenue required to break even in cell E29. You calculate the total sales 
revenue required to break even by using the same basic formula described earlier 
in the chapter. You calculate the volume in units break-even point by dividing the 
sales revenue break-even point by the unit sales price.
The variable costs portion of the break-even analysis shows the amount spent on 
each of the costs. Cell E32 shows the amount that will be spent on direct labor.

414      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The contribution margin, which is the same thing as gross margin, appears in cell 
E41. This shows the amount left over from sales revenue after paying the variable 
costs.
A fixed cost appears in cell E43. By subtracting the fixed costs from the contribu-
tion margin, the workbook calculates the break-even point, which should be zero 
but may not be because of a rounding error. In Figure 1-2, for example, the profit 
before vary-with-profit costs value equals –$135.
Although the information shown in Figure 1-2 may seem to be voluminous, you 
conceptually understand all this data. A little forecast worksheet simply shows the 
sales revenue and the sales units that produce the break-even point. This worksheet 
also shows the amounts that you’ll spend on variable costs and fixed costs. Profits 
equal zero at the break-even point, so there aren’t any vary-with-profit costs.
Understanding the profit-volume-cost 
forecast
Figure 1-3 shows the miniature income statement at various sales volume levels. 
Figure 1-4 shows the same information presented not in dollars but in percentages 
of total sales.

CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      415
The Profit-Volume Forecast worksheet, shown in Figure  1-3, shows the range 
of sales volume both in revenues and in units that the worksheet calculates. The 
lowest sales revenue volume and the highest sales revenue volume are set by your 
input for the low unit volume tested value and the high unit volume tested value. 
(See the numbers entered into cells E6 and E7 of Figure 1-1.)

The Common Size 
Profit-Volume

416      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The miniature income statements in the Profit-Volume Forecast look very similar 
to a typical QuickBooks income statement. The variable-costs portion of the 
miniature income statement reports on the cost of goods sold. The contribution 
margin is equivalent to the gross margin reported in a QuickBooks income 
statement. A fixed cost amount summarizes the operating expenses. The vary- 
with-profit costs essentially summarize income taxes and other profit-based 
expenses, such as a profit-sharing plan. Profits equate to the net income.
Figure 1-3 shows a case in which modest changes in sales revenue can often pro-
duce huge changes in profits. In Figure 1-3, column G in the worksheet shows the 
profit-volume-cost forecast at the sales level equal to $315,000. Column H shows 
the sales revenue and cost forecast at a sales revenue level of $360,000. As the 
firm increases its profits by roughly 15 percent (this increase shown in cells G48 
and H48), profits increase by almost 900 percent from $1,804 to $15,990 (the 
change from the values in cells G73 to H73).
You may not be interested in the common-size profit volume forecast shown 
in Figure 1-4 because this income statement shows percentages based on sales 
rather than dollar amounts. This figure lets you see what percentage of total sales 
a cost item represents. Sometimes this information is useful, and sometimes it 
isn’t. If you aren’t interested in the information, simply select rows 75–101 and 
then delete them from your workbook.
Looking at the profit-volume-cost charts
For fun, I include a couple of simple charts that show results from the profit- 
volume-cost analysis. Figure 1-5, for example, shows the break-even line chart. 
This line chart plots the total fixed costs, the total variable costs, and then the 
total sales. The intersection of the total sales line and the total fixed costs line 
shows the break-even point. By comparing the slopes of the total sales and the 
variable costs line, you can get an idea of how sensitive the profits are to changes 
in sales revenue. If you have a good eye, you can even use the break-even line 
chart to roughly estimate the profit at various revenue levels. To do this, find the 
point on the total sales line equal to the sales revenue level for which you want to 
guesstimate profits. Then use the value axis (the vertical axis on the left side of the 
chart) to calibrate the difference between the total sales line and the total variable 
costs line. The difference between these two lines shows your profit or loss.
The total variable costs line actually shows the total variable costs plus the total 
fixed costs because it’s stacked on top of the fixed costs line.
Figure 1-6 shows the profit-volume-cost data from the worksheet. This analysis 
is more complicated, so the chart is a bit trickier to interpret. Nevertheless, the 
chart resembles the break-even line chart. Fixed costs appear as a dark green band

equal to $150,000 at the bottom of the graph. Variable costs appear as a sort of 
trapezoidal shape on top of the fixed costs. Above those costs appear the costs that 
vary with profits and the actual profit. Note that profits occur only after the firm 
exceeds the break-even point. (The data labels on the horizontal axis represent 
the different volumes being tested.)

You want to grab a working copy of the profit_volume_cost.xlsx workbook if 
you’re at all interested in this stuff. The chart’s colors simply don’t reproduce well 
in grayscale images on the page of a book.
The data plotted in the charts shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6 comes from the work-
sheet range shown in Figure 1-7. I collected all the data to be plotted in this area of 
the worksheet, which is below the profit volume forecast and common-size profit 
volume forecast to make it easy to see what data is plotted and where the data is 
coming from.

DEALING WITH VARY-WITH-PROFIT COSTS
If your profit-volume-cost analysis includes more than a single vary-with-profit cost, you 
must deal with the possibility that your vary-with-profit costs are interrelated. In fact, 
vary-with-profit costs can have one of three relationships: independent-independent, 
independent-dependent, or dependent-dependent.
The independent-independent relationship is the easiest to deal with. If two vary-with- 
profit costs are independent, you can just enter the percentages into the appropriate 
workbook cells and not worry about them. An independent-independent ­relationship 

Profit-Volume-Cost 
Analysis
CHAPTER 1  Profit-Volume-Cost Analysis      419
exists when vary-with-profit costs have no effect on each other. A partnership, for 
example, may have two profit-sharing plans — one for partners and one for 
­employees — that aren’t related.
A slightly more complicated relationship between vary-with-profit costs is the case of an 
independent-dependent relationship. A good example of an independent-dependent 
relationship is the relationship of state and federal income taxes. Because federal 
income taxes allow for a deduction based on state income taxes, the federal income tax 
expense depends on the state income tax expense. If the federal income tax percent 
equals 20 percent, and the state income tax percent equals 10 percent, you can’t simply 
enter the state income tax as 10 percent and the federal income tax as 20 percent. You 
need to adjust the federal income tax percentage for the effect of the state income tax.
Suppose that the state income tax rate is 10 percent of the pre-tax profits and that after 
the state income tax is deducted from the pre-tax profits, the federal income tax rate 
is 20 percent of what’s left over. The correct input percentage for the state income tax 
rate is 10 percent, because 10 percent of the pre-tax profits calculates the correct state 
income tax cost, as follows:
State income tax = 10 percent × pre-tax profits
The federal income tax percentage, however, must recognize the state income tax costs:
Federal income tax = 20 percent × (pre-tax profits - (10 percent × 
pretax profits))
This formula can be further modified to express the federal income tax rate as a per-
centage of the pre-tax profits. Therefore, you input the following into the Profit-Volume- 
Cost Analysis workbook:
Federal income tax = 18 percent × pre-tax profits
A third type of relationship is the dependent-dependent relationship. This relationship 
occurs when one vary-with-profit cost affects another vary-with-profit cost. In the case 
of a typical employee profit-sharing plan, in which profits are based on after-tax prof-
its, you need to know the profit-sharing plan expense to calculate the federal income 
taxes. The profit-sharing plan expense is deductible for purposes of calculating federal 
income taxes, but you must know the federal income tax expense to calculate the after-
tax profits on which the profit-sharing plan is based. In cases of dependent-dependent 
relationships among vary-with-profit costs, you can calculate percentages that in effect 
adjust for the dependency. To do this, you need to employ a fair amount of high-school 
algebra.

P
ro forma financial statements  — which are income statements, balance 
sheets, and cash flow statements  — constitute an integral part of busi-
ness planning and the overall budgeting process. For that reason, I want to 
provide you a bit of ­information about how you create such pro forma (or as if) 
statements.
From the very start, however, I need to warn you that to create such statements, 
you need a tool in addition to QuickBooks. Specifically, you need a spreadsheet 
program such as Microsoft Excel.
Assuming that you do have something like Excel, you can use it and the example  
workbook that this chapter describes to create a simple, yet sophisticated,  
financial forecast for your business. To download the workbook, just type http://

Reviewing Financial Statements 
and Ratios
Before I get into the nitty-gritty details of creating a business forecast, I need 
to briefly discuss what financial statements and ratios are, as well as how to use 
financial statements and ratios to describe the past or future financial condition 
and performance of a business.
The term financial statement can refer to one of several types of schedules and 
summaries of economic information. Typically, however, the term describes 
a set of documents that include an income statement (also called a statement of 
­operations), a balance sheet (also called a statement of financial condition), and a 
cash flow statement.
An income statement details the profits and losses of a business for a specific period. 
Suppose that you want to know the profits or losses of your business over the past 
month. You prepare an income statement that lists your revenue and expenses, 
and calculates the profits or losses for the month.
A balance sheet identifies and lists the assets and liabilities of a business as of a 
specific time. It paints a clear picture of what the business owns, what the busi-
ness owes, and the difference between the two (often called the net worth or 
owner’s equity). Typically, you prepare a balance sheet at of the end of the period 
that an income statement covers. If you prepare an income statement for a month, 
you may also want to prepare a balance sheet on the last day of the month.
A cash flow statement outlines the cash inflows and outflows of a business for a 
specific period. Generally, you prepare a cash flow statement for the same period 
for which you prepare an income statement.
The cash flow statements that large companies use for their investors are quite 
complicated. They show lots of numbers arranged in a very Rube Goldberg–
esque fashion. For this reason, I use the simpler cash flow statement format that 
accountants once used.
Financial ratios (as I describe in some detail in Book 5, Chapter 1) express relation-
ships among the amounts reported in the financial statements. The ratios can 
offer insights into the economic health of a business. The ratios can also indi-
cate how reasonable the implicit assumptions are in a forecast. By comparing the 
ratios of your business with the ratios of similar businesses, you can compare the 
financial characteristics of your business with those of other businesses. By com-
paring the ratios in your pro forma model with industry averages and standards, 
you also test your modeling assumptions for reasonableness.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      423
Two general categories of financial ratios exist: common size ratios and intrastate-
ment or interstatement ratios. Common size ratios convert a financial statement — 
usually a balance sheet or an income statement — from dollars to percentages. 
Common size ratios allow for comparisons of the assets, liabilities, revenue, own-
er’s equity, and expenses of businesses of various sizes. The comparison can be 
either at a point in time or as a trend over time. Intrastatement or interstatement 
ratios quantify relationships among amounts from different financial statements 
or from different parts of the same financial statement, respectively. Intrastate-
ment and interstatement ratios are attempts to account for the fact that amounts 
usually can’t be interpreted alone, but must be viewed in the context of other key 
financial factors and events. In general, both categories of ratios are most valuable 
when compared with industry averages and trends.
This financial ratio business is really cool. If you have time, I heartily recommend 
that you peruse the greater coverage of the topic provided in Book 5, Chapter 1.
Using the Business Plan Workbook
Unfortunately, it really isn’t very practical to create an example set of financial 
statements on, say, the back of a cocktail napkin or a set of sticky notes. You need 
to get the computer’s help.
I suggest that you use Microsoft Excel and a workbook like the one shown in 
­Figures 2-1 through Figure 2-6. With this workbook, which is available at http://
stephenlnelson.com/wp-content/uploads/10_year_bizplan-1.xlsx, you can 
construct pro forma financial statements that enable you to forecast profits and 
losses, financial condition, and cash flows for a business or organization.
To use the workbook, you develop and then enter information about the following:
»
» Assets
»
» Creditor and owner’s equities at the start of the forecasting horizon
»
» Expected changes in the assets and equities over the forecasting horizon
»
» Revenue and expenses for each period on the forecasting horizon
You’re probably wondering how this baby works. Well, the workbook does a lot, 
but it’s actually pretty straightforward in its operation. When you input data that 
includes your starting assets, liabilities, owner’s equity balances, and expected 
changes in these amounts for the forecasting horizon, the workbook constructs 
a balance sheet. The workbook constructs an income statement when you input 

424      BOOK 6  Business Plans
data that includes sales and costs of sales, operating expenses, interest income 
and expenses, and marginal income tax rates. Then, from the balance sheet and 
income statement, the workbook constructs a cash flow statement.
To enter your own data in the business planning starter workbook, perform the 
following steps, entering positive balances or increases as positive amounts and 
negative balances or decreases as negative amounts:
1.	 Open the business plan workbook, bizplan.xls, from my website by 
choosing Excel’s File➪  Open command and then entering http://
stephenlnelson.com/wp-content/uploads/10_year_bizplan-1.xlsx in 
the Filename box.
The starter workbook initially contains the default inputs shown in Figure 2-1. 
Note that you can see only about the first 30 rows and the first 12 or so 
columns of the inputs area. Sorry — I didn’t have room to show everything. If 
you want to see what you’re missing, grab the workbook from the website.
2.	 Enter the Cash & Equivalents balance for the start of the forecasting 
horizon.
The value that you enter for Cash & Equivalents is the dollar total of all the cash 
held at the beginning of the forecasting period.
You can get the Cash & Equivalents value from QuickBooks if you’re forecasting 
from the present forward. The cash that you start with, obviously, is the cash 
that you’re holding today.
FIGURE 2-1:  
The inputs area 
of the business 
plan workbook.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      425
3.	 Enter the forecasted period yield that you expect the cash and equiva-
lents to deliver.
The model estimates the period interest income by multiplying the cash and 
equivalents balance by the yield on cash and equivalents.
4.	 Enter the accounts receivable balance for the start of the forecasting 
horizon.
The value that you enter for accounts receivable (A/R) is the starting accounts 
receivable balance, which is the balance at the beginning of the forecasting 
horizon, excluding any allowance for uncollectible amounts.
5.	 Enter the number of periods of sales in accounts receivable.
The value that you enter for # Periods of Sales in A/R, or number of periods of 
sales in accounts receivable, is the number of periods or the fraction of a 
period for which sales are held in accounts receivable. If accounts receivable 
typically amount to about 30 days of sales, and you use months as your 
forecasting periods, you hold one period (one month) of sales in accounts 
receivable. Alternatively, if accounts receivable typically amount to about 30 
days of sales, and you use years as your forecasting periods, you hold one 
twelfth of a period of sales in accounts receivable.
6.	 Enter the dollar amount of the inventory held at the start of the forecast-
ing horizon.
The Inventory value is the starting inventory balance, which is the total dollar 
amount of the inventory purchased for resale or manufactured for resale and 
held at the beginning of the forecasting horizon.
7.	 Enter the forecasted dollar amount of inventory purchased or produced 
for each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Inventory Purchased/Produced value is the dollar total of items purchased 
or produced over the period.
8.	 Enter the amount of the other current assets held at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The Other Current Assets starting balance is the dollar total of any other 
current assets with which you begin the forecasting horizon. These other 
current assets may include prepaid expenses, short-term investments, and 
deposits made with vendors.
9.	 Enter the amount of the change in the other current assets for each 
period in the forecasting horizon.
The value for Chgs in Other Current Assets, or changes in other current assets 
for the period, is the dollar total of increases or decreases in the accounts 
included in the starting Other Current Assets balance.

426      BOOK 6  Business Plans
10.	Enter the amount of the plant, property, and equipment at the start of 
the forecasting horizon.
The starting Plant, Property, & Equipment balance is the dollar total of the fixed 
assets. This amount includes such items as real estate, manufacturing 
equipment, furniture, and the Learjet.
11.	Enter the amount of the change in plant, property, and equipment 
(P, P, & E) for each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in P, P, & E value is the dollar total of decreases or increases in the 
plant, property, and equipment accounts for the period. Increases in these 
accounts probably stem from purchases of additional fixed assets. Decreases 
in these accounts probably stem from disposal of assets.
12.	Enter the amount of the accumulated depreciation on plant, property, 
and equipment at the start of the forecasting horizon.
The starting Accumulated Depreciation balance represents the depreciation 
expenses charged to date on the assets identified in the starting P, P, & E 
balance.
13.	Enter the amount of the change in the accumulated depreciation for 
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Accum. Depreciation value is the dollar total of increases and 
decreases in the accumulated depreciation account for the period. Increases in 
the accumulated depreciation balance probably stem from the current-period 
depreciation expense. Decreases in the accumulated depreciation balance 
probably stem from removing the accumulated depreciation attributed to a 
fixed asset that you disposed of.
14.	Enter the amount of the other noncurrent assets at the start of the 
period.
The starting Other Noncurrent Assets balance is the dollar total of all other 
noncurrent assets held at the start of the forecasting period. Other noncurrent 
assets may include copyrights, patents, and goodwill.
15.	Enter the amount of the change in the other noncurrent assets for each 
period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Noncurrent Assets value is the dollar total increase or 
decrease for the period in the accounts included in the starting Other 
Noncurrent Assets balance.
16.	Enter the amount of the accounts payable balance at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The starting Accounts Payable (A/P) balance is the dollar total of amounts owed 
vendors for inventory at the start of the forecasting horizon. This starter 
workbook calculates future Accounts Payable balances based on the cost of 

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      427
sales volumes. To add precision to the forecasts of accounts payable, the model 
assumes that accounts payable represent debt incurred for the cost of sales.
17.	Enter the number of periods of the cost of sales in accounts payable.
The # Periods Cost of Sales in A/P entry is the number of periods or the 
fraction of a period for which the cost of sales is held in accounts payable. If 
accounts payable typically amount to about 30 days of cost of sales, and you 
use months as your forecasting periods, you hold one period (one month) of 
cost of sales in accounts payable. Alternatively, if accounts payable typically 
amount to about 30 days of cost of sales, and you use years as your forecast-
ing periods, you hold one twelfth of a period of cost of sales in accounts 
payable.
18.	Enter the amount of the accrued expenses balance at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The starting Accrued Expenses (A/E) balance is the dollar total of amounts 
owed vendors for operating expenses at the start of the forecast horizon. This 
starter workbook calculates future Accrued Expenses balances based on the 
operating expenses levels. To add precision to the forecasts of accrued 
expenses, the model assumes that accrued expenses represent debt incurred 
for operating expenses.
19.	Enter the number of periods of operating expenses in accrued expenses.
The # Periods Operating Expenses in A/E value is the number of periods or the 
fraction of a period for which operating expenses are held in accrued expenses. 
If accrued expenses typically amount to 30 days of operating expenses, and 
you use months as your forecasting periods, you hold one period of operating 
expenses in accrued expenses. Alternatively, if accrued expenses typically 
amount to about 30 days of operating expenses, and you use years as your 
forecasting periods, you hold one twelfth of a period of operating expenses in 
accrued expenses.
20.	Enter the amount of the other current liabilities at the start of the 
forecasting period.
The Other Current Liabilities starting balance is the dollar total of all other 
current liabilities held at the start of the forecasting period. Other current 
liabilities may include income tax payable, product warranty liability, and the 
current portion of a long-term liability.
21.	Enter the amount of the change in the other current liabilities for each 
period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Current Liabilities value is the dollar total of increases or 
decreases for the period in the accounts included in the starting Other Current 
Liabilities balance.

428      BOOK 6  Business Plans
22.	Enter the amount of the long-term liabilities balance at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The starting Long-Term Liabilities balance is the dollar total of debt that will be 
paid back sometime after the next year.
23.	Enter the amount of the change in the long-term liabilities for each 
period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Long-Term Liabilities value is the increase or decrease for the 
period in the outstanding long-term debt. These changes may include 
decreases stemming from the amortization of principal through debt service 
payments and increases stemming from additional funds provided by 
creditors. You need to include the principal component of debt service 
payments as negative amounts because they decrease the amount of long-
term liability.
24.	Enter the amount of the other noncurrent liabilities at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities starting balance is the dollar total of all other 
noncurrent liabilities held at the start of the forecasting period. These may 
include deferred income tax, employee pension plan liabilities, and capitalized 
lease obligations.
25.	Enter the amount of the change in the other noncurrent liabilities for 
each period of the forecasting horizon.
The Chgs in Other Noncurrent Liabilities value is the dollar total of increases 
or decreases for the period in the accounts included in the starting Other 
Noncurrent Liabilities balance. These changes may include decreases stem-
ming from the amortization of principal through debt service payments and 
increases stemming from additional funds provided by creditors.
26.	Enter the amount of the owner’s equity balance at the start of the 
forecasting horizon.
The Owner Equity starting balance is the dollar total of the capital originally 
contributed by owners and the earnings retained by the business at the start 
of the forecasting horizon.
27.	Enter the amount of the change in the owner’s equity balance for each 
period of the forecasting horizon stemming from additional capital 
contributions, dividends, and other special distributions to owners.
The Chgs in Owner Equity value is the dollar total of increases for the period in 
owner’s equity, other than those stemming from the profits of a business, and 
all decreases in owner’s equity. Increases in the Owner Equity balance may 
result from additional offerings of common or preferred stock and Treasury 
stock transactions; decreases in the Owner Equity balance may result from 
dividends and other distributions to stockholders.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      429
Changes to the owner’s equity balance resulting from the profit or loss for the 
period are calculated on the income statement; they aren’t entered.
28.	Enter the sales revenue forecasted for each period of the forecasting 
horizon.
The Sales Revenue values represent the forecasted sales revenues generated 
by the business over each period of the forecasting horizon.
29.	Enter the cost of sales forecasted for each period of the forecasting 
horizon.
The Cost of Sales values represent the forecasted costs of the inventory sold 
for the forecasting horizon.
30.	Enter those costs that fall into the first, second, and third operating 
expense classifications or categories for each period of the forecasting 
horizon.
The operating expenses for Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3 represent the operating 
expenses for the forecasting horizon. These figures may be three expense 
classifications related to operating the business, or they may be the total 
expenses for three groups of expenses.
Typically, you’d use one cost center to track your general and administrative 
expenses, another cost center to track your sales and marketing expenses, and 
yet another cost center to track your research and development expenses. If 
you do this, consider replacing the labels Cost Center 1, Cost Center 2, and Cost 
Center 3 with more descriptive and meaningful labels, such as General & Admin, 
Sales & Marketing, and Research & Development.
31.	Enter the interest expense of carrying any debt used to fund operations 
or asset purchases.
The Interest Expense values represent the period interest expenses of carrying 
any debt related to the business.
32.	Enter the income tax rate that, when multiplied against the profit or loss 
for the period, calculates the income tax expense (or savings).
The Income Tax Rate value is the percentage that, when multiplied by the 
operating profit (or loss), calculates the income tax expense (or savings). This 
can be a little tricky because business income taxes are progressive. A sole 
proprietor’s tax rates go from 0 to roughly 35 percent, for example, depending 
on the level of income. A regular corporation’s income tax rates go from 15 to 
34 percent (with some bounces up and down along the way). This may mean 
that you need your tax adviser’s help to come up with a good number for this 
input. On the other hand, you may just decide to calculate only pre-tax profits 
and losses. To do this, enter this amount as 0.

430      BOOK 6  Business Plans
After you enter the required inputs, the starter workbook makes the calculations 
necessary to construct pro forma financial statements and to calculate a set of 
rather standard financial ratios.
Understanding the Workbook Calculations
The business plan workbook has seven parts: the inputs forecast, Balance Sheet, 
Common Size Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Common Size Income State-
ment, Cash Flow Statement, and Financial Ratios Table. I want to briefly describe 
the Excel calculations that occur within each of these parts so that in case you 
have questions about them or want to make modifications, you can customize the 
starter workbook to perform better for your specific situation.
If you don’t know Excel and don’t want to learn it, don’t worry. You can just skip 
this discussion. I provide it for the benefit of those readers who want to under-
stand the inner workings of the workbook and may need or want to customize the 
workbook’s calculations.
Forecasting inputs
The inputs area of the business planning starter workbook contains one set of 
formulas. The second row identifies the period for which the results are calcu-
lated. The period identifier numbers the periods for which values are entered. The 
start of the first period is stored in cell D3 as the integer 0. Periods that follow are 
stored as the previous period plus 1.
The period identifiers in the Balance Sheet, Common Size Balance Sheet, Income 
Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Financial Ratios Table schedules use similar 
formulas.
The cells that hold the period identifiers use a custom number format that pre-
cedes each period with the word Period. To remove this, simply reformat the cells 
by using another number format. You can most easily do this by selecting a cell 
and then clicking a formatting button on the Excel toolbar, such as the Currency 
or Percent Style button.
Balance Sheet
The Balance Sheet schedule has 19 rows with calculated data, but the first row 
contains only text labels that reflect period numbers, shown in Figure 2-2. (As in 
the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook, the period identifier 

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      431
numbers the periods for which values are forecasted.) The rest of the Balance 
Sheet’s values are described in the following paragraphs.
Cash & Equivalents
The Cash & Equivalents figures show the projected cash on hand at the end of 
each of the forecasting periods. The starting balance is the value you enter in the 
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first 
and subsequent periods is pulled from the Cash Flow Statement schedule, where 
it’s calculated.
Accounts Receivable
The Accounts Receivable (A/R) figures show the net receivables held as of the end 
of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that you enter in the 
inputs planning area of the business starter worksheet. The balance for the first 
and subsequent periods is based on the Sales Revenue and the # Periods of Sales 
in A/R values that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter 
workbook. The formula for the first period is
=E8*E32
The formula for the second period is
=F8*F32
and so on.
FIGURE 2-2:  
The Balance 
Sheet portion 
of the business 
planning starter 
workbook.

432      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Inventory
The Inventory values show the dollar total of the inventory held at the end of each 
forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that you enter in the inputs 
area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and sub-
sequent periods is the previous-period balance plus any inventory purchases or 
production costs minus any cost of sales. The formula for the first period is
=D46+E10 – E33
The formula for the second period is
=E46+F10 – F33
and so on.
Other Current Assets
The Other Current Assets figures show the dollar total of the other current assets 
held at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance for Other Cur-
rent Assets is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning 
starter workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous 
balance plus the change in the balance. The formula for the first period is
=D47+E12
The formula for the second period is
=E47+F12
and so on.
Total Current Assets
The Total Current Assets figures show the dollar total of the current assets at the 
end of each of the forecasting horizons. The balance at any time is the sum of 
Cash  & Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Other Current Assets. 
The formula for the starting Total Current Assets balance is
=SUM(D44:D47)
The formula for the first period is
=SUM(E44:E47)
and so on.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      433
Plant, Property, & Equipment
The Plant, Property, & Equipment figures show the original dollar cost of the 
plant, property, and equipment at the end of each forecasting horizon. The start-
ing Plant, Property, & Equipment balance is the value that you enter in the inputs 
area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and sub-
sequent periods is the previous balance plus any additions to the plant, property, 
and equipment accounts. The formula for the first period is
=D49+E14
The formula for the second period is
=E49+F14
and so on.
Less: Accumulated Depreciation
The Accumulated Depreciation figures show the cumulative depreciation expenses 
charged through the current period for the plant, property, and equipment. The 
starting balance is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business 
planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the 
previous balance minus the current period’s changes in accumulated depreciation. 
The formula for the first period is
=D50 – E16
The formula for the second period is
=E50 – F16
and so on. Because the accumulated depreciation is shown as a negative amount, 
you subtract the positive number pulled from the forecasting inputs.
Net Plant, Property, & Equipment
The Net Plant, Property, & Equipment figures show the difference between Plant, 
Property, & Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation at the end of each of the 
forecasting horizons. The formula for the starting balance is
=D49+D50
The formula for the first period is
=E49+E50

434      BOOK 6  Business Plans
and so on. Because the Accumulated Depreciation balance is shown as a nega-
tive amount, you simply add these two amounts in the formula for the Net Plant, 
Property, & Equipment amount.
Other Noncurrent Assets
The Other Noncurrent Assets figures show the dollar total of any other noncurrent 
assets held at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value 
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The 
balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous-period balance plus 
the change in the account in the current period. The formula for the first period is
=D52+E18
The formula for the second period is
=E52+F18
and so on.
Total Assets
The Total Assets figures show the dollar total of all the assets held at the end of 
the forecasting periods. The balance at any time is the sum of the following: Cur-
rent Assets; Net Plant, Property, & Equipment; and Other Noncurrent Assets. The 
formula for the starting balance is
=D48+D51+D52
The formula for the first period is
=E48+E51+E52
and so on.
Accounts Payable
The Accounts Payable figures show the debt that is related to the cost of sales 
outstanding at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value 
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The 
balance for the first and subsequent periods is Cost of Sales for the period times # 
Periods Cost of Sales In A/P. The formula for the first period is
=E20*E33

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      435
The formula for the second period is
=F20*F33
and so on.
Accrued Expenses
The Accrued Expenses figures show the debt that is related to the operating 
expenses outstanding at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is 
the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter work-
book. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the operating expenses 
times # Periods Operating Expenses in A/E. The formula for the first period is
=E22*SUM(E34:E36)
The formula for the second period is
=F22*SUM(F34:F36)
and so on.
Other Current Liabilities
The Other Current Liabilities figures show the dollar total of other debts outstand-
ing at the end of the forecasting periods that will be paid within the current year 
or business cycle. The starting balance is the value that you enter in the inputs 
area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the first and sub-
sequent periods is the previous balance plus the change in the current period. The 
formula for the first period is
=D59+E24
The formula for the second period is
=E59+F24
and so on.
Total Current Liabilities
The Total Current Liabilities figures show the dollar total of all the current liabili-
ties at the end of each forecasting period. The balance at any time is the sum of 

436      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Current Liabilities. The formula 
for the starting balance is
=SUM(D57:D59)
The formula for the first period is
=SUM(E57:E59)
and so on.
Long-Term Liabilities
The Long-Term Liabilities figures show the dollar total of the long-term out-
standing debt at the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the 
value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. 
The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous balance plus any 
changes in the Long-Term Liabilities balance in the current period. The formula 
for the first period is
=D62+E26
The formula for the second period is
=E62+F26
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities figures show the dollar total of any other non-
current outstanding debt at the end of each forecasting period. The starting bal-
ance is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter 
workbook. The balance for the first and subsequent periods is the previous-period 
balance plus the change in the current period. The formula for the first period is
=D63+E28
The formula for the second period is
=E63+F28
and so on.

CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      437
Total Noncurrent Liabilities
The Total Noncurrent Liabilities figures show the dollar totals of the long-term 
debt and the other noncurrent outstanding debt at the end of each forecasting 
period. The balance at any time is the sum of Long-Term Liabilities and Other 
Noncurrent Liabilities. The formula for the starting balance is
=D62+D63
The formula for the first period is
=E62+E63
and so on.
Owner Equity
The Owner Equity figures show the dollar totals of the owner’s equity accounts at 
the end of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value that you enter 
in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The balance for the 
first and subsequent periods is the previous-period balance plus Net Income After 
Taxes for the period, plus other adjustments, such as additional capital contribu-
tions and dividends. The formula for the first period is
=D65+E30+E113
The formula for the second period is
=E65+F30+F113
and so on.
Total Liabilities and Owner Equity
The Total Liabilities and Owner Equity figures show the dollar totals of Current 
Liabilities, Noncurrent Liabilities, and Owner Equity at the end of each forecasting 
period. The formula for the starting balance is
=D60+D64+D65
The formula for the first period is
=E60+E64+E65
and so on.

438      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The Total Assets value should equal the Total Liabilities and Owner Equity value. 
If they differ, your model contains an error.
Common Size Balance Sheet
The Common Size Balance Sheet schedule lists — in the balance sheet format — 
what percentage of the total assets each individual asset represents and what 
­percentage of the total liabilities and owner’s equity each individual liability 
and the owner’s equity represents, as shown in Figure 2-3. When you compare 
these percentages with those of business peers, you can see the relative financial 
strength or weakness of your business. Trends in the percentages over time can 
indicate improvement or deterioration in the overall financial condition of your 
business.
The Common Size Balance Sheet schedule has 19 rows with calculated data that 
express line-item amounts as percentages of the total. For the asset side of the Bal-
ance Sheet, assets are expressed as a percentage of the total assets. For the creditor 
and owner’s equity side of the Balance Sheet, equities are expressed as a percentage 
of the total liabilities and owner’s equity. The formulas for all rows except Total 
Assets and Total Liabilities and Owner Equity simply convert the Balance Sheet 
values to percentages. The Cash & Equivalents formula for the starting period is
=D44/D$53
The formula for the first period is
=E44/E$53
FIGURE 2-3:  
The Common Size 
Balance Sheet 
portion of the 
business plan 
workbook.

CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      439
and so on. All asset percentages are derived from dividing by Total Assets, which 
explains why the absolute reference to row $52 is used in all asset formulas. 
­Similarly, the absolute reference to row $66 appears in all formulas in the liabili-
ties and equity formulas.
The formula for the Total Assets percentage at any time is the sum of the Current 
Assets percentage; the Net Plant, Property & Equipment percentage; and the Other 
Noncurrent Assets percentage. The result always equals 100 percent.
Similarly, the formula for the Total Liabilities and Owner Equity percentage at any 
time is the sum of the Current Liabilities, the Noncurrent Liabilities, and Owner 
Equity percentages. The result is always 100 percent.
Income Statement
The Income Statement schedule has 13 rows of calculated data, as shown in 
­Figure  2-4. As in other schedules, the period identifier simply numbers the 
­periods for which values are calculated. The first period is stored in cell E96 as 
the ­integer 1, and the periods that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1. 
The other values in the Income Statement are calculated as described in the 
­following paragraphs.
Sales Revenue
The Sales Revenue figures are the estimates that you enter in the inputs area 
of the business planning starter workbook. The amount for the period is the value 
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.
FIGURE 2-4:

Less: Cost of Sales
The Cost of Sales figures are the Cost of Sales estimates that you enter in the 
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.
Gross Margin
The Gross Margin figures show the amounts left over from the sales proceeds 
after subtracting Cost of Sales. Subtracting your other expenses from the Gross 
Margin amount gives you your profit figure. The Gross Margin formula is Sales 
Revenue for the period minus Cost of Sales. The formula for the first period is
=E97+E98
The formula for the second period is
=F97+F98
and so on. Notice that because the Cost of Sales figures are pulled into the Income 
Statement schedule as negative amounts, the Gross Margin formula simply adds 
the Sales Revenue figure to the negative Cost of Sales figure.
Operating Expenses: Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3
The Operating Expenses figures for Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3 show the amount for 
each operating expense classification or category that you enter in the inputs area 
of the business planning starter workbook.
Total Operating Expenses
The Total Operating Expenses figures show the sums of the operating expenses 
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook for 
these three operating-expense categories or classifications. The total for each 
period is the sum of the operating expenses for Cost Centers 1, 2, and 3. The for-
mula for the first period is
=SUM(E102:E104)
The formula for the second period is
=SUM(F102:F104)
and so on.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      441
Operating Income
The Operating Income figures show the sales dollar amounts left after paying the 
Cost of Sales and the Operating Expenses. The Operating Income figures represent 
the amounts that go toward paying your financing expenses and income tax, as 
well as the amount that constitutes your profits. The amount for each period is the 
Gross Margin figure for the period minus the Total Operating Expenses figure. The 
formula for the first period is
=E99 – E105
The formula for the second period is
=F99 – F105
and so on.
Interest Income
The Interest Income figures show the earnings from investing the cash of the 
business. The amount for each period is the beginning Cash & Equivalents balance 
from the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook multiplied by the 
period yield on Cash & Equivalents. The formula for the first period is
=D44*E6
The formula for the second period is
=E44*F6
and so on.
Interest Expense
The Interest Expense figures show the costs of using borrowed funds for opera-
tions and asset purchases. The amount for each period is the value that you enter 
in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook.
Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes
The Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes figures show the amount of operating income 
left after receiving any interest income and paying any interest expense. The 
amount for each period is the Operating Income figure for the period plus the 

442      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Interest Income figure for the period, minus the Interest Expense figure for the 
period. The formula for the first period is
=E106+E108 – E109
The formula for the second period is
=F106+F108 – F109
and so on.
Income Tax Expenses (Savings)
The Income Tax Expenses (Savings) figures show the income tax expenses (or 
­savings) that use the calculated Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes figures and the Mar-
ginal Income Tax Rate figures that you forecasted in the inputs area of the business 
planning starter workbook. Notice that the model calculates a current period savings 
in income taxes when there’s a net loss before taxes. This may be the case when a 
current-period loss is carried back to a previous period or when the current-period 
loss is consolidated with the current-period income of related businesses. Basically, 
then, the model assumes that a net loss before income taxes results in a current-
period tax refund — that is, an overall tax savings — because you can deduct a loss 
in one business from the profits of another business. If a current-period loss doesn’t 
result in a current-period income tax savings, however, you modify the formula as 
described in “Customizing the Starter Workbook” later in this chapter.
The amount for each period is the Net Income (Loss) Before Taxes multiplied by 
the Marginal Income Tax Rate figure. The formula for the first period is
=E38*E110
The formula for the second period is
=F38*F110
and so on.
Net Income (Loss) After Taxes
The Net Income (Loss) After Taxes figures calculate the after-tax profits of oper-
ating the business. The amount for each period is the Net Income (Loss) Before 
Taxes figure minus the Income Tax Expenses (Savings) figure. The formula for 
the first period is
=E110 – E112

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      443
The formula for the second period is
=F110 – F112
and so on.
Common Size Income Statement
The Common Size Income Statement schedule lists, in income statement format, 
what percentage of the total sales revenue each income statement line item rep-
resents (refer to the bottom of Figure 2-4). When you compare these percentages 
with those of business peers, you can see the relative financial performance of 
your business. Trends in the percentages over the forecasting horizon can indicate 
improvement or deterioration in the financial performance of your business.
The Common Size Income Statement schedule has 13 rows of calculated data that 
express the component line-item amount for each period as a percentage of the 
sales revenue figure for the period. The formulas for all rows except Sales Revenue 
simply convert the Income Statement values to percentages.
The Sales Revenue figures add the Cost of Sales, Total Operating Expenses, Inter-
est Income, Interest Expense, Income Tax Expenses (Savings), and Net Income 
(Loss) After Taxes percentages. The results always equal 100 percent.
The Sales Revenue percentage calculations add the expense and profit percent-
ages. Those expenses shown as negative amounts, therefore, are subtracted.
Cash Flow Statement
The Cash Flow Statement schedule has 16 rows of calculated data, shown in 
­Figure  2-5. As in other schedules, a period identifier numbers the periods for 
which values are calculated. The first period is stored in cell E136 as integer 1. 
Periods that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1. Other Cash Flow State-
ment values are calculated as described in the following paragraphs.
Beginning Cash Balance
The Beginning Cash Balance figures show the forecasted cash and equivalents 
balance at the start of each forecasting period. The starting balance is the value 
that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. For 
subsequent periods, the Beginning Cash Balance is the previous period’s Ending 
Cash Balance.

444      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Net Income After Taxes
The Net Income After Taxes figures show the amounts calculated in the Income 
Statement schedule as the business profits for each forecasting period.
Addback of Depreciation
The Addback of Depreciation figures show the change in the accumulated depre-
ciation balance for each forecasting period. Normally, this change stems from 
the period depreciation expense; it must be added back into the Net Income After 
Taxes figure because the depreciation expense uses no cash. The depreciation 
added back for each period is the value that you enter in the inputs area of the 
business planning starter workbook as the change in accumulated depreciation.
Accounts Payable Financing
The Accounts Payable Financing figures show the change in the Accounts Pay-
able balance for the period. Increases in this balance result when the cost of sales 
expense paid during the period is lower than the expense incurred. Decreases in 
this balance result when the cost of sales expense paid is higher than the expense 
incurred. By recognizing the changes in this account balance, the model adjusts 
for differences between the Income Statement’s accrual-based accounting of cost 
of sales expenses and the actual cash disbursements for cost of sales expenses.
The Accounts Payable Financing figure for each period is the difference between 
the Accounts Payable balance at the end of the previous period and the balance 
at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E57 – D57
FIGURE 2-5:  
The Cash Flow 
Statement and 
the first few rows 
of the Financial 
Ratios Table.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      445
The formula for the second period is
=F57 – E57
and so on.
Accrued Expenses Financing
The Accrued Expenses Financing figures show the change in the accrued expenses 
balance for the period. Increases in this balance result when the operating expense 
paid during the period is lower than the expense incurred. Decreases in this bal-
ance result when the operating expense paid during the period is higher than the 
expense incurred. By recognizing the changes in this account balance, the model 
adjusts for differences between the Income Statement’s accrual-based accounting 
expenses and the actual cash disbursements for operating expenses.
The Accrued Expenses Financing figure for each period is the difference between 
the Accrued Expenses balance at the end of the previous period and the balance 
at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E58 – D58
The formula for the second period is
=F58 – E58
and so on.
Other Current Liabilities Financing
The Other Current Liabilities Financing figures show the change in the Other Cur-
rent Liabilities balance for the period. This amount increases when, either directly 
or indirectly, cash is generated by borrowing. This amount decreases when, either 
directly or indirectly, cash is used to pay off short-term borrowing.
The Other Current Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the difference 
between the Other Current Liabilities balance at the end of the previous period 
and the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E59 – D59
The formula for the second period is
=F59 – E59
and so on.

446      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Long-Term Liabilities Financing
The Long-Term Liabilities Financing figures show the changes in the long-term 
liabilities amount for the period. This balance increases when, either directly or 
indirectly, cash is generated by long-term borrowing. This amount decreases 
when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to pay off long-term borrowing.
The Long-Term Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the difference 
between the Long-Term Liabilities balance at the end of the previous period and 
the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E62 – D62
The formula for the second period is
=F62 – E62
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing figures show the changes in the Other 
Noncurrent Liabilities balance for the period. This amount increases when, either 
directly or indirectly, cash is generated by other long-term borrowing. This 
amount decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is used to pay off other 
long-term borrowing.
The Other Noncurrent Liabilities Financing figure for each period is the difference 
between the Other Noncurrent Liabilities balance at the end of the previous period 
and the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E63 – D63
The formula for the second period is
=F63 – E63
and so on.
Accounts Receivable Investments
The Accounts Receivable Investments figures show the change in the Accounts 
Receivable balance for each forecasting period. This amount increases when 
the sales revenue collected during the period is less than the revenue recorded. 

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      447
This amount decreases when the sales revenue collected during the period is more 
than recorded. By recognizing the changes in the account balance, the model 
adjusts for differences between the income statement’s accrual-based accounting 
of sales revenues and the actual cash collections for sales.
The Accounts Receivable Investments figure for each period is the difference 
between the Accounts Receivable balance at the end of the previous period and the 
balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E45 – D45
The formula for the second period is
=F45 – E45
and so on.
Inventory Investments
The Inventory Investments figures show the change in the inventory balance for 
each forecasting period. This amount increases when the inventory sold is less 
than the inventory acquired. This amount decreases when the inventory sold is 
more than the inventory acquired. By recognizing the changes in this account 
balance, the model recognizes the cash effects of changing inventory balances.
The Inventory Investments figure for each period is the difference between the 
Inventory balance at the end of the previous period and the balance at the end of 
the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E46 – D46
The formula for the second period is
=F46 – E46
and so on.
Other Current Assets Investments
The Other Current Assets Investments figures show the changes in the Other 
­Current Assets balance for the period. This amount increases when, either directly 
or indirectly, cash is used to acquire current assets. This amount decreases 
when, either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by converting current assets 
to cash.

448      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The Other Current Assets Investments figure for each period is the difference 
between the Other Current Assets balance at the end of the previous period and 
the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E47 - D47
The formula for the second period is
=F47 – E47
and so on.
Plant, Property, & Equip Investments
The Plant, Property, & Equip Investments figures show the change in the Plant, 
Property, & Equipment balance for the period. This amount increases when, either 
directly or indirectly, cash is used to acquire plants, property, and equipment. 
This amount decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by 
converting plants, property, and equipment to cash.
The Plant, Property, & Equip Investments figure for each period is the difference 
between the Plant, Property, & Equipment balance at the end of the previous period 
and the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E49 – D49
The formula for the second period is
=F49 – E49
and so on.
Other Noncurrent Assets Investments
The Other Noncurrent Assets Investments figures show the changes in the Other 
Noncurrent Assets balance for the period. This amount increases when, either 
directly or indirectly, cash is used to acquire other noncurrent assets. This amount 
decreases when, either directly or indirectly, cash is generated by converting other 
noncurrent assets to cash.
The Other Noncurrent Assets Investments figure for each period is the difference 
between the Other Noncurrent Assets balance at the end of the previous period 
and the balance at the end of the current period. The formula for the first period is
=E52 – D52

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      449
The formula for the second period is
=F52 – E52
and so on.
Other Owner Equity Changes
The Other Owner Equity Changes figures show the cash flows stemming from 
any additional capital contributions made by the owners to the business or from 
dividends and other distributions made by the business to the owners. The Other 
Owner Equity Changes figure for each period is the value that you enter in the 
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook. The Other Owner Equity 
Changes figures are pulled into the Uses of Cash section as negative values because 
a positive change in owner’s equity, such as an additional capital contribution 
(from a stock offering, for example), doesn’t use cash but provides cash.
Net Cash Generated (Used)
The Net Cash Generated (Used) figures show the total cash flow for each period of 
the forecasting horizon, based on the listed sources and uses of cash. The amount 
for each period is the sources of cash for the period less the uses of cash for the 
period. The formula for the first period is
=SUM(E140:E146) – SUM(E149:E154)
The formula for the second period is
=SUM(F140:F146) – SUM(F149:F154)
and so on.
Ending Cash Balance
The Ending Cash Balance figures show the forecasted cash and equivalents bal-
ance at the end of each period. The balance is the Beginning Cash Balance figure 
for the period plus the Net Cash Generated (Used) figure for the period. The for-
mula for the first period is
=E137+E155
The formula for the second period is
=F137+F155
and so on.

450      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Financial Ratios Table
The Financial Ratios Table has 11 rows of calculated data, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
As in other schedules, the period identifier numbers the periods for which values 
are calculated. The first period is stored in cell E159 as the integer 1, and periods 
that follow are stored as the previous period plus 1. The other values in the Finan-
cial Ratios Table are calculated as described in the following paragraphs.
Current Ratio
The Current Ratio figures show the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. 
The current ratio provides one measure of a business’s capability to meet its 
short-term obligations. The Current Ratio figure for each period is the Total Cur-
rent Assets figure from the Balance Sheet schedule divided by the Total Current 
Liabilities figure. The formula for the first period is
=E48/E60
The formula for the second period is
=F48/F60
and so on.
Quick Ratio
The Quick Ratio figures show the ratio of the sum of the cash and equivalents plus 
the accounts receivable to the current liabilities. The quick ratio provides a more 
FIGURE 2-6:  
The Financial 
Ratios Table.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      451
stringent measure of a business’s capability to meet its short-term financial obli-
gations than other ratios. The Quick Ratio figure for each period is the sum of the 
Cash & Equivalents figure and the Accounts Receivable figure divided by the Total 
Current Liabilities figure. The formula for the first period is
=(E44+E45)/E60
The formula for the second period is
=(F44+F45)/F60
and so on.
Working Capital to Total Assets
The Working Capital to Total Assets figures show the ratio of working capital (the 
current assets minus the current liabilities) to the total assets. The Working Capi-
tal to Total Assets ratio is another measure of a business’s capability to meet its 
financial obligations and gives an indication as to the distribution of a business’s 
assets into liquid and nonliquid resources. The Working Capital to Total Assets 
ratio for each period is calculated by dividing the difference between the Current 
Assets and Current Liabilities figures by the Total Assets figure. The formula for 
the first period is
=(E48 – E60)/E53
The formula for the second period is
=(F48 – F60)/F53
and so on.
Receivables Turnover
The Receivables Turnover figures show the ratio of sales to the accounts receiv-
able balance. The Receivables Turnover ratio indicates the efficiency of sales 
­collections. One problem with the measure as it’s usually applied is that both 
credit and cash sales may be included in the ratio denominator. Two potential 
shortcomings exist with this approach:
»
» The presence of the cash sales may make the receivables collections appear 
more efficient than is the case.
»
» Mere changes in the mix of credit and cash sales may affect the ratio even 
though the efficiency of the receivables collections process hasn’t changed.

452      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The Receivables Turnover figure for each period is calculated by dividing the Sales 
Revenue figure for the period by the Accounts Receivable balance outstanding at 
the end of the period. The formula for the first period is
=E97/E45
The formula for the second period is
=F97/F45
and so on.
Inventory Turnover
The Inventory Turnover row shows the ratio of the cost of sales to the inventory 
balance. The Inventory Turnover ratio calculates how long inventory is held. It can 
indicate depleted or excessive inventory balances. The Inventory Turnover ratio 
for each period is calculated by dividing the Cost of Sales figure for the period by 
the inventory held at the end of the period. The formula for the first period is
= – E98/E46
The formula for the second period is
= – F98/F46
and so on.
Times Interest Earned
The Times Interest Earned row shows the ratio of the sum of the net income after 
taxes plus the interest income to the interest expense. The ratio indicates the rela-
tive ease with which the business is paying its financing costs. The Times Interest 
Earned ratio for each period is calculated by dividing the sum of the Operating 
Income and Interest Income figures from the Income Statement schedule by the 
Interest Expense figure. The formula for the first period is
=(E106+E108)/E109
The formula for the second period is
=(F106+F108)/F109
and so on.

Creating a Business 
Plan Forecast
CHAPTER 2  Creating a Business Plan Forecast      453
Sales to Operational Assets
The Sales to Operational Assets row shows the ratio of sales revenue to net plant, 
property, and equipment. The ratio indicates the efficiency with which a ­business 
uses its operational assets to generate sales revenue. The Sales to Operational 
Assets ratio for each period is the Sales Revenue figure that you enter in the 
inputs area of the business planning starter workbook divided by the Net Plant, 
­Property, & Equipment figure from the Balance Sheet schedule. The formula for 
the first period is
=E97/E51
The formula for the second period is
=F97/F51
and so on.
Return on Total Assets
The Return on Total Assets row shows the ratio of the sum of the net income 
after taxes plus the interest expense to the total assets for each period. The ratio 
indicates the overall operating profitability of the business, expressed as a rate of 
return on the business assets. The formula for the first period is
=(E113+E109)/E53
The formula for the second period is
=(F113+F109)/F53
and so on.
Return on Equity
The Return on Equity row shows the ratio of the net income after taxes to the 
owner’s equity for each period. The ratio indicates the profitability of the business 
as an investment of the owners. The Return on Equity ratio for each period is the 
Net Income (Loss) After Taxes figure from the Income Statement schedule divided 
by the Owner Equity figure from the Balance Sheet schedule. The formula for the 
first period is
=E113/E65

454      BOOK 6  Business Plans
The formula for the second period is
=F113/F65
and so on.
Investment Turnover
The Investment Turnover row shows the ratio of the sales revenue to the total 
assets. The ratio, such as the Sales to Operational Assets ratio, indicates the 
­efficiency with which a business uses its assets (in this case, its total assets) to 
generate sales. The Investment Turnover ratio for each period is the Sales Revenue 
figure that you enter in the inputs area of the business planning starter workbook 
divided by the Total Assets figure from the Balance Sheet schedule. The formula 
for the first period is
=E97/E53
The formula for the second period is
=F97/F53
and so on.
Financial Leverage
The Financial Leverage row shows the difference between the return on owner’s 
equity and the return on total assets. The ratio indicates the increase or decrease 
in an equity return as a result of borrowing. A positive value indicates an improve-
ment in the return on owner’s equity by using financial leverage; a negative value 
indicates deterioration in the return on owner’s equity. The Financial Leverage 
figure for each period is the Return on Total Assets figure minus the Return on 
Equity figure. The formula for the first period is
=E170 – E169
The formula for the second period is
=F170 – F169
and so on.

Customizing the Starter Workbook
You can use the business plan workbook for many business projections, but you 
may want to change the starter workbook so that it more closely matches your 
requirements. You can add text that describes your business and the forecasting 
horizon, for example. You can also increase or decrease the number of periods, 
perhaps increasing the number of periods to 12 if your periods are months and you 
want to forecast an entire year.
Before you change anything in the starter workbook other than the forecasting 
inputs, unprotect the document. To do this, choose the Review tab and click the 
Unprotect Sheet button.
Unless you turn off cell protection, input cells in the inputs area of the business 
planning starter workbook are the only cells into which you can enter data.
Changing the number of periods
You can easily increase or decrease the number of forecasting periods.
To increase the number of periods, remove the borders from the last column and 
then copy the current last column to the right as needed.
To decrease the number of periods, simply delete any unnecessary columns from 
the right side of the schedule. (To delete a column, highlight the entire column by 
clicking at the top of that column, right-click to bring up Excel’s shortcut menu, 
and then choose Delete.) After you finish these steps, you can replace the borders 
on the right and reinstate cell protection as needed.
Performing ratio analysis on existing  
financial statements
If you want to perform financial ratio analysis on a set of existing financial state-
ments, copy the contents of column E from the row in the inputs area of the busi-
ness plan workbook that contains the sales revenue forecast (row 32) through the 
last row of the ratios table into column D. Then remove the columns for periods 1 
through 10 (columns E through N) by following the steps described in “Changing 
the number of periods” earlier in this chapter. Optionally, you can delete the Cash 
Flow Statement and add appropriate column headings as needed.
To use the modified starter workbook, enter the necessary Balance Sheet and 
Income Statement data in each of the unshaded cells in column D of the inputs 

456      BOOK 6  Business Plans
area of the business planning starter workbook. (Typically, the As Of date of the 
Balance Sheet and the ending date of the Income Statement period are the same.)
Calculating taxes for a current  
net loss before taxes
To calculate the income tax expense as 0 when you have a current period net loss 
before income taxes, you edit the formula in the cell that calculates the income tax 
expense (or savings) for the first period (cell E112) so that it takes the maximum 
of the calculated expense amount or 0 by using the MAX function:
=MAX(E38*E110,0)
After you’ve done this, you can copy the formula into the rest of the cells in the 
forecasting horizon that calculate the income tax expense (or savings). To do this, 
select the cell with the formula you want to copy, click the Home button, and then 
click the Copy button. Next, select the range of cells into which you want to copy 
the formula, and click the Paste button.
Combining this workbook  
with other workbooks
A quick and perhaps obvious point: You may want to construct other workbooks 
to supply numbers to the business plan workbook discussed in this chapter. You 
can construct an asset depreciation schedule, for example, that uses the straight-
line depreciation convention for a $25,000 asset representing your entire plant, 
property, and equipment investment and then use this data in the business plan 
workbook.
If you start doing more Excel work, and you’re not all that comfortable with Excel, 
consider picking up a recent edition of Excel For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.). It’s a great tutorial on the basics. Also, if you want more 
information about constructing supporting financial workbooks (such as an asset 
depreciation schedule), you may want to visit my website, www.stephenlnelson.
com. I provide a freebie version of another book I’ve written, the MBA’s Guide to 
Microsoft Excel (Redmond Technology Press), that describes how to do tasks like 
these (see http://stephenlnelson.com/articles/category/excel/).
If you want to use workbooks together in this manner, you should probably com-
bine the workbooks into a single workbook. The easiest way to copy one of the 
workbooks is to copy the workbook’s worksheet to a blank worksheet in the other 
workbook. (Each of the starter workbooks uses only a single worksheet to make 
this process both easy and possible.)

I
n Book 6, Chapter  2, I describe how to create a pro forma plan of business 
financial forecasts by using the bizplan.xls workbook, which can be down-
loaded from http://stephenlnelson.com/wp-content/uploads/10_year_ 
bizplan-1.xlsx. If you do create a forecast, you probably also want to create a 
companion business plan. For this reason, you also need to know about writing 
such a plan. I don’t go into tedious detail about how to do this. I just provide you 
some useful information about business plans, and I give you some tips about how 
to more easily write a workable business plan.
What the Term “Business Plan” Means
In truth, the term business plan actually refers to three separate things:
»
» A strategic plan: A discussion or description of a firm’s overall strategy
»
» A new-venture plan: The fund-raising document that entrepreneurs use to 
promote a new venture to investors
»
» A white-paper plan: The 50-page or even 100-page document that a business 
owner uses to describe in detail a new business opportunity, including its 
risks, its opportunities, and anything else that’s germane
I talk a little bit about each of these plans — some more than others — in the 
following pages.

A Few Words about Strategic Plans
Unfortunately, I’m not really equipped to provide you detailed information about 
how to construct a strategic plan. Of course, neither are most of the other people 
who willingly offer advice. That said, however, I can provide you some useful 
starting points for constructing your strategic plan.
First off, the way that you’re using the word strategy is very likely wrong because 
you aren’t talking about strategy at all. For my source on this perspective, I rely 
on what Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, said in his strat-
egy classic Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors 
(published by Free Press).
The really interesting thing that Porter says in his book (and something that’s 
worth repeating over and over) is that practically speaking, only three basic busi-
ness strategies exist:
»
» A cost strategy
»
» A differentiated product or service strategy
»
» A focus on a niche strategy
Because understanding these strategies is critical to writing a good strategic plan 
(and to correctly using the term strategy), in the following section I briefly discuss 
in my own words what Porter means by limiting possible strategies to only three. 
I demonstrate each of these strategies by using example firms in an industry that 
we’re all pretty familiar with: bricks-and-mortar retailing.
Cost strategies
Successful retailers rely on a cost strategy. Firms such as Walmart and Costco 
excel at providing products to their customers economically. They pass along a 
lot of the benefits of this economy to their customers in the form of lower prices. 
Not all the cost savings get passed along to the consumers, however. A significant 
portion of the cost savings, achieved through incredibly efficient operations, are 
retained by the business and, therefore, become profits.
Such cost leadership or low-cost operation is one of the three basic strategies. And 
it’s a strategy available to any business — and particularly those businesses that 
have achieved economies of scale.
The key thing to note about a low-cost strategy, however, is that the firm needs to 
retain some of the cost savings to earn a higher profit level than its competitors. 

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      459
Thus, simply being a low-cost producer isn’t enough. A firm needs to be a low-
cost producer and still be able to price products and services at a level high enough 
that some of the cost savings are retained as profits.
Differentiated products and  
services strategies
The second basic strategy is product differentiation. Product differentiators often 
sell a very unusual product or service. The Nordstrom department store chain is 
a good example because it offers unsurpassed service, and often (although not 
always), it offers a great and high-quality selection of items. Nordstrom goods 
cost more, but consumers happily pay the extra amount. Why? Because they get 
so much more for their money.
A firm that relies on a differentiation strategy competes on the basis of the special 
features of its products or services. The key to making this strategy work is being 
able to charge your customers more for those special features than the special 
features cost you. Differentiation needs to produce increased revenue in excess of 
increased costs.
Focus strategies
The focus strategy is really a hybrid of the cost and differentiation strategies. This 
strategy states that in some ways, a firm is really good about managing costs; and 
in other ways, this firm is really good about differentiating products or services. A 
firm may choose to take this hybrid approach because it understands a particular 
audience or niche of customers or category of products; in other words, the firm 
can, through this focused approach, serve a particular market better than anybody 
else. This firm is going to be the best at serving a particular niche. Again, as is 
the case with other strategies, the focus strategy must produce increased revenue 
greater than the increased cost of the strategy or cost savings (to the business) 
greater than the lower prices passed along to customers.
So what’s a focus strategy retailer? I’d say that Target is. Target, in my opinion, 
focuses on suburban middle-class customers by offering those consumers almost 
the perfect combination of cost savings and differentiated products.
Look, Ma: No Strategy
This all probably sounds like gobbledygook if you haven’t been exposed to much 
strategic thinking before. The strategies and their strengths become very clear, 

460      BOOK 6  Business Plans
however, when you compare firms that have these strategies — cost leaders such 
as Walmart and Costco, differentiation leaders such as Nordstrom, and focus 
leaders such as Target — with firms that lack a clear strategic focus.
Perhaps the best-known current example of the retailer that (in my opinion) lacks 
a clear-cut strategy is Kmart. This becomes very clear when you start compar-
ing Kmart with the leaders in each of the three strategies. Consider the following 
three problems that Kmart is plagued by:
»
» Kmart can’t compete on cost. If you’re really concerned about cost, you can 
go someplace like Walmart or Costco and get a better price than you can get 
at Kmart. So Kmart loses cost-conscious customers to Walmart and Costco.
»
» Kmart can’t compete with differentiation. If you really want a highly 
differential product, the best in its class, you aren’t going to go to Kmart. Here, 
Kmart loses out to stores like Nordstrom, which charge higher prices but offer 
a wider range of differentiated products. If you want the best in class, you 
won’t end up at Kmart; you’ll go to a store that’s emphasizing and excelling at 
this strategy.
»
» Kmart doesn’t have a particular focus. Does Kmart serve a particular niche 
better than anybody else? I don’t know. But at least in the category of 
suburban middle-class consumers, Target probably does a much better job. If 
you’re really looking for clothes or household items appropriate in a middle-
class suburb, is there any question that Target beats the pants off Kmart? I 
don’t think so.
So now you can see how the word strategy is misunderstood and used incorrectly. 
Strategy isn’t a way to refer to some idea you have; strategy, in business, refers to 
an approach (probably one of the three generic approaches) to beating your com-
petition: cost, differentiation (probably in terms of product excellence), and focus.
Here’s the key: If you can execute a strategy better than anybody else can, you 
win. If you try to do a little bit of this or a little bit of that, or if you ignore or can’t 
bring yourself to pick a particular strategy, you’re going to be continually beaten 
up by firms that have picked a strategy. You lose the cost game to the cost leaders. 
You lose the differentiation game to the differentiators. And you lose at competing 
in particular niches to those firms that focus on those niches.
Two comments about tactics
I won’t talk any more about this strategy business, but I have a couple of com-
ments about tactics. Most of the time when you hear people talk about strategy, 
they’re not really talking about strategy; they’re usually talking about tactics.

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      461
Tactics refers to choices that firms make in an attempt to successfully execute 
strategy. The irony is that the people who misuse the word strategy (by referring 
to tactics as strategy) often don’t have a strategy. This is my first comment.
My second comment is that tactics, predictably, don’t work and don’t make sense 
except as support for a particular strategy. To pursue a strategy of cost leader-
ship, for example, you must ensure that all your tactics support that strategy. You 
undermine your success in executing that strategy if some tactics support a cost 
strategy, some tactics support a differentiation strategy, and some tactics support 
a focus strategy. This makes sense, right? In this situation, you become a jack of 
all trades and a master of none.
Six final strategy pointers
Before you move on to the next topic, be sure that you understand these key points:
»
» Know the three strategies. Usually, a firm can have only one of three 
business strategies:
•	 Cost-based strategy
•	 Differentiation-based strategy
•	 Focus-based strategy
»
» Pick a strategy. The first step — the step that you take before you can select 
appropriate tactics — is picking a strategy. From the strategy decision, all 
other tactical decisions follow.
»
» Support the strategy with appropriate tactics. A strategic plan, obviously, 
must have a clearly defined strategy. Then it must identify, or enumerate, the 
tactics that support the strategy. It’s really as simple as that. And note this 
important point: The only appropriate tactics are those that support one of 
these strategies.
»
» Stick to your strategy. The hard part of writing a strategic plan is to discipline 
yourself (or the firm) to pick a strategy and then stick with it. Few firms want 
to be disciplined to stick with a hard-core strategy of cost, product differentia-
tion, or focus. It’s all too easy to slip-slide your way into a situation in which 
you’re trying to be a little of this or a little of that. Picking a particular strategy 
means that you forgo certain kinds of opportunities and that you say no to 
some customers and certain kinds of products.
»
» Read Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and 
Competitors. I discuss this book in “A Few Words about Strategic Plans” earlier 
in this chapter. It’s a difficult book to read, and much of the material is a 
couple of decades old, but it’s worthwhile reading for any business owner. 

462      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Reading it won’t be much fun, but I feel very confident that the 15 or 20 hours 
you’ll spend reading the book constitute an enormously useful investment of 
your time.

» Poke around my Evergreen Small Business blog. If you have time, you 
ought to consider poking around my blog and perusing the strategy-related 
posts at http://evergreensmallbusiness.com/category/strategy/. You 
should find the coverage pretty useful because I rewrite the typical business-
school strategy talk in terms that pretty directly translate to the small-business 
owner’s or manager’s situation.
A White-Paper Business Plan
People often write a white-paper business plan when they know that they need a 
strategic plan but don’t want to make the hard decisions necessary for a strategic 
plan. The person in this conundrum writes a lengthy white-paper business plan 
to camouflage the absent strategic plan.
I guess it’s obvious from the preceding paragraph, but you really should write 
a strategic plan before you write a white-paper business plan. A strategic plan, 
by the way, doesn’t need to be more than a page or two in length. In fact, the 
hard part of a strategic plan isn’t in the writing, but in the sacrifice: giving up 
certain categories of opportunities, markets, and tactical approaches that may be 
comfortable or familiar. Obviously, you can’t write a good white-paper business 
plan — or at least one that’s based on a sound strategy — until you have a stra-
tegic plan in place.
Perhaps the most important thing to know when you write a white-paper busi-
ness plan is this: This process is well documented in a bunch of other places. If 
you have QuickBooks Premier or QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, you can choose 
the Company➪  Planning & Budgeting➪  Use Business Plan Tool command to start a 
wizard that steps you through the process of writing a white-paper business plan.
Figure 3-1 shows the first page of the QuickBooks Business Planner, but I’m not 
going to talk more about the wizard here. You can use the wizard to see what it 
does.
You can also get detailed information on writing a business plan in both Eng-
lish and Spanish from the US  Small Business Administration (SBA) website at 
https://www.sba.gov.

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      463
Figure 3-2 shows the home page of the SBA website. You’ll find this page easiest 
to get to (because all you need is the domain name), so you may want to start your 
exploration of the SBA’s business planning resources here. If you click the Start-
ing & Managing link and then choose Create Your Business Plan in the list of links 
displayed, you see a page of information that the SBA website offers about writing 
a business plan (see Figure 3-3). It provides links to additional pages of detailed 
information about the process of writing a business plan, such as a page that pro-
vides advice on doing strategic planning and a page that supplies step-by-step 
instructions for the actual work of writing your plan.
The SBA website changes, predictably, but you should be able to hunt down its 
links to relevant business planning topics, such as “business plan basics,” “writ-
ing the plan,” and “using the plan.”
I should also point out that Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint (which 
many computer users own because Word and PowerPoint are components of 
just about every version of Microsoft Office) supply a detailed outline for creat-
ing a white-paper business plan. (To get to these business plan outlines, choose 
File➪  New and then poke around in the template libraries.) These business plan 
templates provide very good starting outlines, so don’t be misled into thinking 
that something that Microsoft has provided for free to Word or PowerPoint users 
is in some way inferior to what real businesses use. Microsoft has done an excel-
lent job of showing what information belongs in a white-paper business plan.

464      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Most white-paper business plans and new-venture business plans (which I define 
in the next section) require a pro forma financial forecast. Book 6, Chapter  2 
describes how to do this. Typically, in a hard-copy printed business plan, you 
include such a forecast as an appendix.
After you create a good, solid strategy and at least a rough white-paper business 
plan, you may also want to create a new-venture plan. The next section describes 
how to do this.

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      465
A New-Venture Plan
To write a new-venture plan, you take a different approach from the one you 
take to write a white-paper plan. New-venture plans answer five basic questions, 
which provide prospective investors the necessary information to determine 
whether they should further investigate your venture as a possible investment. 
The next sections detail these five questions.
Is the new venture’s product  
or service feasible?
In some cases, this question is unnecessary to ask, but the answer is important to 
consider in any case in which a firm may invest in a new, unproven idea. This sit-
uation is most clearly illustrated in the case of a firm that plans to build and then 
market some newfangled technology. If you’re thinking of starting a firm that 
will produce a better mousetrap, a key question to ask is whether you really can 
build a better mousetrap. You can answer this question in a couple of ways, prac-
tically speaking. Obviously, the best way to answer this question about feasibility 
is to build the better mousetrap first. Having built the better mousetrap, you’ll 
find it easy to prove to prospective investors that yes, the product is feasible. You 
can set your mousetrap on the desk and demonstrate how it works. Perhaps on 
some . . . no, no, let’s not go there.
If a product hasn’t already been built or a service hasn’t already been proved to be 
deliverable, the next-best approach — and the one commonly used by technology 
start-ups — is to assemble a team of people who have built similar products in 
the past. The logic of this approach is that if you have a team that has built similar 
technologies in the past, investors can probably rely on this team’s track record of 
success. If a team of talented engineers has built new and improved mousetraps, 
it’s very easy for investors to prudently believe that this team may be able to build 
a better mousetrap in the future. The engineers understand the technology. They 
understand the problem. They’re experienced in creating new solutions to address 
the problem. You see how easy it is to buy into the possibility.
Does the market want the product  
or service?
Assuming that you do have a firm with a practical, feasible product or service, 
you need to answer another big question right up front: Do people really, truly 
want the product or service? In other words, is there public demand for the firm’s 
offering? This business about demand seems kind of tricky to ascertain. Ideally, 
a new venture proves that demand exists by already having customers buying the 

466      BOOK 6  Business Plans
product. If a new venture hasn’t yet finished the product or service, such hard- 
and-fast proof of demand is impossible to come by. In this case, you have another 
option: You can prove market demand by running independent market research 
studies to say “Yes, we’ve run several focus groups, and people say they’ll buy a 
better mousetrap.”
Sometimes, you can also prove market demand by showing that consumers or 
businesses already purchase a similar product or service and would, logically, 
purchase a clearly improved version of the product or service. In the case of the 
better mousetrap, people are already buying a lot of mousetraps. So if you truly 
did build better mousetraps, you could pretty much prove market demand by 
demonstrating the new product’s superiority.
Let me encourage you to take a big bite of the reality sandwich if you’re thinking 
this way, however. You need to be very careful about this issue of market demand, 
because it’s all too easy for entrepreneurs and inventors who are excited about 
some new technology or some new product or service to assume that consum-
ers really will want the new thing that is being built or offered. Consumers are 
notoriously fickle. What seems like a wonderful innovation to the entrepreneur or 
inventor often isn’t so wonderful in the eyes of the consumer.
Can the product or service  
be profitably sold?
Okay, the first two questions ask whether a product or service is feasible and 
whether people want the product. Is that enough? No, actually it isn’t. The third, 
critically important question is whether the product that you’re selling can be 
sold profitably. You must run rough numbers to prove that products or services 
revenue less the cost of goods sold produces a gross margin that is adequate not 
just to pay the operating expenses of the firm, but also to retain something for 
profit. This proof that the firm can profitably sell its product or service is really 
achieved by the business pro forma financial forecast (as described in Book 6, 
Chapter  2). This forecast proves that the firm can be profitable by selling the 
product or service.
Include a fair salary for your efforts in your profitability calculations if you’ll man-
age the new business. Your business isn’t really profitable unless it can pay you 
(and other team members) a fair wage and reasonably expected fringe benefits.
I won’t say a lot more about this profitability issue, but basically, all the account-
ing stuff discussed throughout this book comes into play here. To do a decent 
new-venture plan, you need to understand enough accounting to produce a set of 
forward-looking financial statements that persuasively argue a profitable venture.

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      467
Is the return on the venture adequate for 
prospective investors?
Curiously, simply proving that a firm’s venture will be profitable often isn’t 
enough. A firm also needs to deliver profits at least equal to and, ideally, in excess 
of the return on investment that the investors desire. In the case of a new ven-
ture, investors have pretty firm expectations of what a risky investment should 
deliver. Angel investors commonly require rates of return in the neighborhood of 
20 to 25 percent annually. Small-business entrepreneurs and business owners 
often require similar rates of return. Institutional and professional venture capital 
investors (the sort of people that you read about in The Wall Street Journal and in 
Inc. magazine) often require annual rates of return of 45 percent to 55 percent — 
or even 65 percent annually.
If you think about what all of this means, you can quickly see that even a pretty 
darn good business that delivers the 30 to 35 percent annual rate of return — and 
that’s really good if you think about it — won’t be enough for some investors. An 
institutional venture capital investor who needs, for example, a 50 percent annual 
return on his investment isn’t going to look seriously at anything that produces 
only a meager 30 percent annual return.
Essentially, in a new-venture plan, you provide information that lets the pro-
spective investor figure out the rate of return. Then the prospective investor can 
compare this return with his or her requirements.
It’s not a bad idea to look at the returns that you’re implicitly suggesting via your 
new-venture plan. Make sure that you aren’t trying to sell a 25 percent annual 
return investment to investors who require a 50 percent annual return. Similarly, 
you may not need to offer investors who will be happy with a 25 percent annual 
return a deal that pays a 50 percent annual return. Book 5, Chapter 2 offers a dis-
cussion of economic value-added analysis that details how you can compare the 
return delivered by a firm to investors with the return on investment that those 
investors expect.
Can existing management run  
the business?
Even if you have a venture based on a feasible product or technology, even if you 
have customers who are hysterically excited to purchase your product, even if 
you have a product or service that will bring in a massive profit, and even if your 
investors will be able to earn a wonderful return on their investment, that’s still 
not enough. A new-venture plan must ask and answer one other critical question.

468      BOOK 6  Business Plans
Any new-venture plan needs to sell prospective investors on the idea that the 
existing management team — which includes the founder or president and his 
or her lieutenants or vice presidents — can successfully operate the business. In 
other words, even a great business opportunity requires a good management team 
in place (or almost in place), ready to execute the business plan.
Here are a couple of ways that you can prove that the management team isn’t 
going to be a problem:
»
» Have a management team in place that has already successfully 
executed a venture similar to the new venture. If you’re trying to sell 
prospective investors on the idea that the management team can create a  
$25 million business selling a better mousetrap, your task will be much easier 
if the same management team at some point in the past created a $25 million 
business selling a better mousetrap.
»
» Show that the management team members — or at least most of them — 
are successful people. A team of people who have succeeded at big things in 
the past suggests to investors that the management team knows how to win. 
I’m not talking about an Eagle Scout designation; I’m thinking more on the line 
of an MBA from Stanford or a few years of management experience in some 
big, well-run, highly respected company. If some members of your team have 
proved their business savvy and cognitive skills — or, even better, successfully 
managed an important division in another business — in a nutshell, you’re 
saying to prospective investors, “Hey, this management team will bring home a 
win for us.”
Some final thoughts
Okay, I have a handful of final comments to make about new-venture business 
planning:
»
» The general outline: Although new-venture business plans serve a different 
purpose from white-paper business plans, you use the same sort of general 
outline for both. In other words, even though a new-venture business plan 
has as its primary purpose answering the five questions discussed in the 
preceding sections, you follow an outline like the one provided by the SBA 
website (or like the one provided by Word or PowerPoint).
»
» A few caveats: Although you definitely want to make sure that your new- 
venture business plan answers the five questions, keep in mind the following 
caveats:

Writing a Business Plan
CHAPTER 3  Writing a Business Plan      469
•	 Don’t lay it on too thick. You want to write something that looks like a 
white-paper business plan, but edit it well to minimize the amount of 
super-detailed information and to clearly and boldly answer the five 
questions that the new-venture investor needs to ask and have answered.
•	 Remember that a new-venture investor typically isn’t going to write you a check 
based on what he or she sees in a new-venture business plan. What you put in 
a new-venture business plan is simply information that will tickle the 
new-venture investor’s fancy. The information should be just enough to 
make him or her think “This sounds pretty cool. I’ll take a closer look.”
•	 It’s very unlikely that any entrepreneur or business owner can honestly answer 
“Yes” to all five questions. Some people will say that you need to offer a 
dynamite, ironclad, super deal that nobody could refuse. In my opinion, 
any sophisticated new-venture investor who expects you to be able to 
answer with a 100 percent guaranteed “Yes” to every question is probably 
pretty naive. Anybody who has half a clue knows that risk exists in any 
business venture. Even if you have a great technology that’s already built, 
customers clamoring with orders in the reception area of your office, and a 
great management team in place — even if everything seems perfect — 
stuff still goes wrong.
Having said that, however, note that answering any of the five questions with 
a definite “No” means that the new venture won’t work — or at least it won’t 
work for you as the business owner or as the manager. Each of the five 
questions is a link in the chain of success. Break any link — regardless of 
which one — and the chain breaks.

CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      473
Administering 
QuickBooks
Q
uickBooks does something that’s critically important to the success of 
your business: It collects and supplies financial information. For this rea-
son, you want to have a firm understanding of how you can protect the 
data that QuickBooks collects and stores, as well as the assets that QuickBooks 
tracks. This chapter describes all of this.
Keeping Your Data Confidential
Accounting data is often confidential information. Your QuickBooks data shows 
how much money you have in the bank, what you owe creditors, and how much 
(or how little!) profit your firm produces. Because this information is private, your 
first concern in administering a QuickBooks accounting system is keeping your 
data confidential.
You have two complementary methods for keeping your QuickBooks data con-
fidential. The first method for maintaining confidentiality relies on the security

features built into Microsoft Windows. The other method relies on QuickBooks’s 
security features.
Using Windows security
You can use the security provided by Microsoft Windows to restrict access to a 
file — either a program file or a data file — to specific users. This means that 
you can use Windows-level security to say who can and can’t use the QuickBooks 
program or access the QuickBooks data file.
I don’t describe how Windows-level security works in this book. If you’re already 
employing Windows-level security, you know (or someone in your office knows) 
how to use that tool to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, program files 
and data files. To use Windows-level security for QuickBooks, you can simply 
apply your existing general knowledge to the QuickBooks program file or the 
QuickBooks data file.
If you aren’t already using Windows-level security, you don’t need to go to the 
trouble of learning Windows’s complicated security system. You can use the sim-
pler QuickBooks security.
Using QuickBooks security
You can protect the confidentiality of your QuickBooks data by assigning a pass-
word to a QuickBooks company data file. You can do this during the QuickBooks 
setup process. You can also set up a password by choosing the Company ➪ Change 
Your Password command. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays 
the Change Your Password dialog box (see Figure 1-1). To set up a password, you 
simply enter the same password in both the New Password text box and the Con-
firm New Password text box. Note that your password is associated with the user-
name Admin (which stands for administrator). If you haven’t yet set up a password, 
you don’t have an old password, so you won’t see a Current Password text box. If 
you’re working with an Administrator password, you must also provide a chal-
lenge question and answer. (This answer will let you recover your access to your 
QuickBooks file if you forget the Administrator password.)
Obviously, you want to set your password so that no one (not even a computer) 
can possibly guess it. This means that your password shouldn’t be a word in a 
dictionary. Your password also shouldn’t be a number. And your password espe-
cially shouldn’t be a word, phrase, or name that some co-worker can easily figure 
out. The best passwords (from a security point of view) are nonsensical combina-
tions of letters and numbers, such as f34t5s or s3df43x2. One other thing: Longer 
is better.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      475
After you set your password, you should change it periodically. To change your 
password, you also choose the Company  ➪  Change Your Password command. 
QuickBooks again displays the Change Your Password dialog box. This time, you 
must enter your old password in the Current Password text box. Then you need 
to enter your new password in both the New Password text box and the Confirm 
New Password text box.
QuickBooks requires a username and password before it will open the company 
data file. If you assign a password to your company data file, for example, when-
ever QuickBooks starts, it displays the QuickBooks Login dialog box, where you 
enter your username and password and then click OK. QuickBooks opens the data 
file. If you can’t supply the password, QuickBooks doesn’t open the data file.
Using QuickBooks in a Multiuser 
Environment
You aren’t limited to using just one password to control access to your QuickBooks 
data file. You can set up several passwords for the QuickBooks data file. What’s 
really neat about this is that you can tell QuickBooks to allow certain users and 
passwords to do only certain things. This sounds complicated, but it’s really not. 
The business owner, for example, may have a password that allows her to do any-
thing. But a new accounting clerk, for example, may have a password that allows 
him only to record bills in the system.

Setting up additional QuickBooks users
If more than one person will be using QuickBooks, you want to set up additional 
users.
Adding users in QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions
To add users in QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Company ➪ Users ➪ Set Up Users and Roles command.
QuickBooks displays the User and Roles dialog box (see Figure 1-2). This dialog 
box identifies any users for whom QuickBooks access has been set up and the 
roles QuickBooks can fill when using QuickBooks. The Users list, which appears 
on the User List tab of the dialog box, also identifies who is currently logged on 
to the system.
2.	 Tell QuickBooks that you want to add a user by clicking the New button.
When you click this button, QuickBooks displays the New User dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 1-3.
3.	 Identify the user and supply a password.
You need to give each user for whom you are setting up a username. You do 
this by entering a short name — perhaps the user’s first name — in the User 
Name box. After you identify the user, you enter the user’s password in both 
the Password text box and the Confirm Password text box.
FIGURE 1-2:  
The Users and 
Roles dialog box.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      477
4.	 Identify the user’s role(s).
Use the Available Roles list box to select the roles (or duties) the user fills. Then 
add the selected role to the user’s list of assigned roles by clicking the Add 
button. To remove a role from a user, select the role in the Assigned Roles list 
box and then click Remove.
The Description box at the bottom of the New User dialog box describes the 
role in more detail, including the type of QuickBooks user who might typically 
be assigned the selected role.
5.	 (Optional) Modify roles as necessary.
You can fine-tune the roles that you (with QuickBooks’s help) assign. To do so, 
select the Role List tab of the Users and Roles dialog box, click the role you want 
to change, and then click the Edit button. When QuickBooks displays the Edit Role 
dialog box (see Figure 1-4), select an accounting activity or area in the Area and 
Activities list and then use the Area Access Level radio buttons to specify what a 
user with the selected role can do. You can indicate that the user should have no 
access by selecting the None radio button. You can indicate that the user should 
have full access by selecting the Full radio button. If the user should have partial 
access, you select the Partial button and then check or clear (as appropriate) the 
Create, Modify, Delete, Print, and View Balance check boxes. Click OK to save any 
changes to the roles and return to the Users and Roles dialog box.
You can see what access any role initially has by selecting one of the entries in 
the Area and Activities list. QuickBooks uses the Area Access Level buttons and 
boxes to show the current settings for the role.
FIGURE 1-3:  
The New User 
dialog box.

478      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
As a general rule, when it comes to accounting controls, you want to provide a 
minimal amount of access. If someone doesn’t need access to the QuickBooks 
data file for day-to-day duties, you should select the None button. If someone 
needs a little bit of access — perhaps to prepare job estimates or invoices — 
you give just that access and nothing more. A little bit later in this chapter, 
in “Maintaining Good Accounting Controls,” I talk about why minimizing user 
rights and access is so important. But the bottom line is this: The more ability 
you give employees or subcontractors or accountants to noodle around in 
your accounting system, the greater the risk that someone will either 
inadvertently or intentionally introduce errors into the system. Also, the 
greater the rights and access you give, the easier you make it for someone to 
steal from you.
6.	 (Optional) Review your user permissions.
After you set up a user, you should (just to be careful) review the permissions 
you’ve given the user. To do this, click the User List tab of the Users and Roles 
dialog box, select the user, and then click the View Permissions button. When 
QuickBooks displays the View Permissions dialog box (not shown), select the 
user and then click the Display button to see the View Permissions window 
(see Figure 1-5), which displays a very detailed list of what the user can and 
can’t do.
7.	 (Optional) Review your role modifications.
If you change a role’s permissions, you probably also want to review those 
changes. To do that, click the Role List tab of the Users and Roles dialog box, select 
the role, and then click the View Permissions button. QuickBooks displays another 
FIGURE 1-4:  
The Edit Role 
dialog box.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      479
version of the View Permissions dialog box that lists the roles you and QuickBooks 
have set up. Select the role you want to review and then click the View Permissions 
button. QuickBooks displays another version of the View Permissions window, with 
a detailed list of what someone with the role can and can’t do.
8.	 After you finish reviewing user and role permissions, click Close to close 
any open windows and then click the Cancel or Close button to close any 
open dialog boxes.
From this point forward, the new user can use QuickBooks; his or her rights 
are limited to what you specified.
Accountants often want to see the rights that particular users have, especially if 
they’re auditing you as part of annual closings. (You may be audited if the bank 
wants audited financial statements, for example.) QuickBooks’s View 
Permissions window is a slick way to see this data online, and if you want to 
print a copy of the permissions information, all you need to do is click the 
window’s Print button.
Adding users in QuickBooks Pro and Premier
To set up additional users in QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Choose the Company ➪ Set Up Users and Passwords ➪ Set Up Users command.
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box (not shown), which identifies any 
users for whom QuickBooks access has been set up and who are currently 
logged on to the system.
FIGURE 1-5:  
The View Permis-
sions window.

480      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
2.	 Tell QuickBooks that you want to add a user by clicking the Add User 
button.
QuickBooks displays the first Set Up User Password and Access dialog box.
3.	 Identify the user, and supply a password.
Give each user for whom you’re setting up a password a username by entering 
a short name — perhaps the user’s first name — in the User Name box. After 
you identify the user, you enter the user’s password in both the Password text 
box and the Confirm Password text box.
4.	 Click Next to continue and then indicate whether you want to limit 
access for the new user.
When QuickBooks displays the second Set Up User Password and Access 
dialog box, indicate whether you want to limit access and rights for the user. 
If you do want to limit access and rights (rights are simply the things that the 
user can do), select the Selected Areas of QuickBooks radio button. If you want 
the user to be able to do anything, select the All Areas of QuickBooks radio 
button. If you indicate that the new user should have access to all areas of 
QuickBooks, you’re done setting up the user password, and you can skip the 
remaining steps.
5.	 Click Next to continue and then describe access to sales and accounts 
receivable information and tasks.
When you complete Step 4, QuickBooks displays the third Set Up User 
Password and Access dialog box — the first of a series of dialog boxes that 
walk you through an interview, asking detailed questions about what kind of 
access each user should have to a particular area. With regard to sales activity, 
for example, QuickBooks asks about access to transactions (such as invoices, 
credit memos, and accounts receivable information). You can indicate that the 
user should have no access by selecting the No Access radio button. You can 
indicate that the user should have full access by selecting the Full Access radio 
button. If the user should have partial access, you select the Selective Access 
radio button and then select one of the subsidiary buttons: Create 
Transactions Only, Create and Print Transactions, or Create Transactions and 
Create Reports.
6.	 Click Next and then describe the purchases and accounts payable rights.
When you complete Step 5 by clicking Next, QuickBooks displays the fourth Set 
Up User Password and Access dialog box, which allows you to specify what 
access this new user has in the purchases and accounts payable areas. You can 
select the No Access radio button. You can select the Full Access radio button. 
Or you can select some middle ground by selecting the Selective Access radio 
button and one of the subsidiary buttons. The same rules for setting rights and 

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      481
access that apply to the purchases and accounts payable area apply to the 
sales and accounts receivable area.
7.	Click Next and then describe the remaining user rights and access.
When you click the Next button shown at the bottom of each version of the 
Set Up User Password and Access dialog box, QuickBooks displays several 
other versions of the dialog box that it uses to query you about user rights 
and access. After you describe what rights are appropriate for the user in the 
purchases and accounts payable area, for example, QuickBooks asks about 
the checking and credit card area. Then it asks about the inventory area. 
Next, it asks about payroll, followed by questions about general, sensitive 
accounting activities. Finally, QuickBooks asks about access to financial 
reporting capabilities.
You limit rights in each of these other areas the same way that you do for the 
sales and accounts receivable and for the purchases and accounts payable 
areas. Therefore, I’m not going to describe how you select the No Access 
option button, the Full Access option button, or the Selective Access button 
over and over again. Just be thoughtful as you go through the screens, limiting 
the user’s rights. You want users to have the rights necessary to do their job, 
but you don’t want to give them any more rights than they need.
8.	Specify whether the user can change or delete transactions.
After you’ve stepped through roughly a half-dozen versions of the Set Up User 
Password and Access dialog boxes that ask about specific areas of accounting, 
QuickBooks displays the Changing or Deleting Transactions page of the Set Up 
User Password and Access dialog box. The Changing or Deleting Transactions 
page lets you indicate whether a user can or can’t change transactions 
recorded before the closing date. In general, you want to limit a user’s ability to 
change or delete transactions.
9.	Click Next and then review your rights decisions.
When you click Next, QuickBooks displays the final version of the Set Up User 
Password and Access dialog box, which identifies the user rights that you 
assigned or allowed. You can use this dialog box to review the rights that 
someone has. If you realize that you’ve incorrectly assigned rights, click the 
Back button to move back through the dialog boxes to the one where you 
made a mistake. Change the assignment of rights, and click the Next button to 
return to the final window of the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box.
10.	When you finish with the review of user rights and access, click Finish.
From this point forward, the new user will be able to use QuickBooks; his or 
her rights are limited to what you specified.

482      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
Changing user rights in  
Enterprise Solutions
You can modify the rights that you assign to a user. To do this in QuickBooks 
Enterprise Solutions, choose the Company  ➪  Users  ➪  Set Up Users and Roles com-
mand to display the Users and Roles dialog box (see Figure 1-6).
FIGURE 1-6:  
The Users and 
Roles dialog box.
CAPTURING RIGHTS SETTINGS
Accountants often want to see the rights that particular users have, especially if they’re 
auditing you as part of annual closings. (You may be audited if the bank wants audited 
financial statements, for example.) QuickBooks doesn’t provide a way for you to print 
the information shown in the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box. Windows, 
however, allows you to use the Print Screen key to capture a screen shot of the 
QuickBooks program window and the Set Up User Password and Access dialog box.
Press Alt+Print Scrn to shoot a screen shot of the dialog box. This key combination copies 
an image of your screen to the Windows Clipboard. Next, open Paint by choosing Start ➪ 
Programs ➪ Accessories ➪ Paint. Paste the image into Paint by pressing Ctrl+V. You may 
see an error message that says The image in the Clipboard is larger than 
the bitmap. Would you like the bitmap enlarged? Click Yes. Save the screen 
shot by choosing File ➪  Save As. (This basic technique is the same one that I use to show 
you pictures of the QuickBooks windows in the pages of this book.) You may want to 
capture a screen shot image this way to record the user access and rights for employees.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      483
To change a user’s rights after reviewing them, select the user and click the Edit 
button. QuickBooks displays the Edit User dialog box (see Figure  1-7), which 
closely resembles the New User dialog box that you use to set up the user and 
describe his or her rights. You use the User Name, Password, and Confirm Pass-
word text boxes to change the user information. You can use the Available Roles 
list, the Assigned Roles list, and Add and Remove buttons to change what the user 
can do within QuickBooks.
To duplicate a user (you may want to add a second user with permissions that 
mirror some other user’s permissions), select the user you want to clone and 
then click Duplicate. When QuickBooks displays the Duplicate User dialog box (see 
Figure 1-8), finish describing the new user, and click OK.
FIGURE 1-7:  
The Edit User 
dialog box.
FIGURE 1-8:  
The Duplicate 
User dialog box.

484      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
To remove a user, you also use the User and Roles dialog box. Simply select the 
user and then click the Delete button (refer to Figure 1-6). QuickBooks asks you 
to confirm your deletion. When you click the Yes button for confirmation, Quick-
Books removes the user.
Changing user rights in QuickBooks Pro  
and Premier
You can modify the rights that you assign to a user in QuickBooks Pro or Premier. 
To do this, choose Company ➪ Set Up Users and Passwords ➪ Set Up Users to dis-
play the User List dialog box (not shown).
To look at the rights that a particular user has, select the user in the list and 
then click the View User button. When you do, QuickBooks displays the View User 
Access dialog box (not shown). This dialog box shows the same information as 
the final version of the Set Up User Access and Password dialog box, which is the 
dialog box that you use initially to specify what rights a user should have. Click the 
Leave button to close the View User Access dialog box.
To change a user’s rights after reviewing them, select the user and then click the 
Edit User button. QuickBooks steps through the same set of dialog boxes that you 
use to set up the user and describe his rights. You use the Next and Back buttons 
to do things such as change the username or password, specify whether the user 
should be limited in his access, and — if necessary — to limit the user’s access to 
a particular activity within QuickBooks.
To remove a user, you also use the User List dialog box. Simply select the user and 
then click the Delete User button. QuickBooks asks you to confirm your deletion. 
When you click the Yes button for confirmation, QuickBooks removes the user.
Using Audit Trails
If you decide to allow multiple users access to the QuickBooks data file, you’ll 
appreciate the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature, which keeps a record of who makes 
what changes in the QuickBooks data file.
You can’t remove transactions from the Audit Trail list or history except by 
archiving and condensing data. Archiving and condensing data are described in 
Book 7, Chapter 2.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      485
Turning on Audit Trail tracking
QuickBooks provides an always-on Audit Trail feature that you can use if you 
ever need to determine who changed some bit of information or when some bit of 
information changed.
Producing an Audit Trail report
To produce an Audit Trail report, simply choose Reports ➪ Accountant and 
Taxes ➪ Audit Trail. Figure 1-9 shows a QuickBooks Audit Trail report. Note that 
this report identifies both the type of change made and the person who made the 
change in the QuickBooks data file.
Enabling Simultaneous Multiuser Access
Sometimes, you need only a single computer and a single copy of QuickBooks, 
even though you have several employees using QuickBooks. If a small business 
has only an administrative assistant and the owner accessing a QuickBooks data 
file, for example, one copy of QuickBooks running on a single personal computer 
may be all that’s required. QuickBooks does allow for simultaneous use of the 
FIGURE 1-9:  
An Audit Trail 
report.

486      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
QuickBooks data file by multiple users, however. Predictably, you first need to set 
up multiple users, as described earlier in this chapter.
After you’ve set up multiple users, you can install the QuickBooks program on 
other personal computers and then — assuming that all these personal computers 
connect to a Windows network — use those other copies of QuickBooks to access 
the QuickBooks data file stored on the first or principal computer.
To use QuickBooks in an environment of simultaneous use by multiple users, you 
also need to tell QuickBooks that simultaneous use is okay. To do this, choose the 
File ➪ Switch to Multi-User Mode command. (If you want to turn off Multi-User 
Mode later, choose File ➪ Switch to Single User Mode again.)
QuickBooks supports simultaneous use by multiple users through a technology 
called record locking, which locks all the records that you’re working with, but not the 
entire QuickBooks data file. If you want to work with Company A, and some other 
user wants to work with Company B, that’s okay. QuickBooks allows it. What you 
and the other user can’t do, however, is work on the same company (A or B) at the 
same time. This would mean that you’re working with the same customer record.
You can’t install the same copy of QuickBooks on multiple machines and legally 
have a multiple-user QuickBooks system. You must purchase a copy of QuickBooks 
for each machine on which QuickBooks is installed. Note, however, that Intuit does 
sell some multiple-user versions of QuickBooks in which you actually buy five 
licenses in one box of QuickBooks. (The Enterprise version of QuickBooks supports 
multiple-user networks with up to 30 simultaneous users, and the other versions 
of QuickBooks support multiple-user networks with up to 5 simultaneous users.)
You may want to have several QuickBooks users if sales representatives in your 
firm prepare invoices or prepare bids for customers. In this case, you may want 
to have each salesperson set up on QuickBooks. Note, however, that these sales-
people should have the ability only to create an invoice or perhaps create and print 
an invoice estimate. For reasons discussed more fully in the next section of this 
chapter, you want to be very careful about giving inexperienced accounting users 
full access to the accounting system.
Maintaining Good Accounting Controls
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I talk about how QuickBooks allows 
multiple users. Many businesses, after they grow to a certain size, need to support 
multiple users with access to accounting information and the capability, in some 
cases, to create accounting transactions. Unfortunately, multiple accounting sys-
tem users create risk for the business owner. By having access to the accounting 

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      487
system, users can either inadvertently introduce errors into the accounting sys-
tem or (unfortunately) intentionally defraud a business. For these reasons, I want 
to briefly list some QuickBooks control techniques that a business owner or busi-
ness manager can use to minimize unintentional errors and minimize the oppor-
tunity for theft. Here are my best ideas:
»
» Regularly compare physical inventory counts with inventory accounting 
records. Inventory shrinks, unfortunately. People — sometimes employees, 
but often pseudocustomers, such as shoplifters — steal inventory. Therefore, 
one thing you need to do, both to minimize your inventory losses and to 
maintain accurate accounting records, is regularly compare physical counts of 
your inventory with what your accounting records show. A small convenience 
store, for example, may want to compare tobacco inventory on a daily basis, 
beer and wine inventory on a weekly basis, and all other grocery inventory 
items on a monthly or annual basis. This approach to frequently counting the 
most valuable and easiest-to-steal items accomplishes two things:
•	 Inventory shrinkage is quickly identified.
•	 The business owner can minimize inventory shrinkage by identifying the 
type of inventory that is most often stolen or even when inventory is most 
often stolen.
»
» Reconcile bank accounts. One thing that business owners should do, in my 
opinion, is reconcile their own bank accounts. Often, employee theft by 
accounting personnel occurs as employees figure out how to write checks on 
the company’s bank account that the owner doesn’t see. One sure way to find 
a fictitious and fraudulent transaction is to have the owner reconcile the bank 
statement. If the owner reconciles the bank statement, she can compare the 
bank’s accounting for the account with the company’s QuickBooks accounting 
records. Any obvious discrepancies can be fixed, which means that the 
QuickBooks accounting records are more accurate. Additionally, any flaky, 
suspicious transactions tend to become obvious when the business owner 
looks closely at checks.
The first employee I ever hired was a check forger. He began forging checks 
on one of my business checking accounts two or three weeks after he started 
working for me. I caught him only because I was regularly reconciling the 
checking account. (He was convicted of a felony a few months later.)
»
» Segregate accounting from physical custody where possible. In a small 
business, it’s difficult to always separate the accounting for some activity from 
the physical custody or physical responsibility for that activity. It’s tough to 
segregate the inventory accounting from physical custody or access to that 
inventory. A store clerk, for example, may easily be able to steal cigarettes and 
also adjust inventory records through cash register sales for cigarettes. 
Nevertheless, wherever you can segregate physical custody from accounting, 
built-in error checking occurs. The person doing the accounting indirectly 

488      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
checks on the physical custodians’s caretaking of the asset. If the physical 
custodian is stealing cartons of cigarettes, for example, that fact shows up when 
the accountant compares the accounting records with the physical accounts of 
inventory. Similarly, someone who doesn’t have access to the cash and the 
bank account can’t easily steal cash, even if he has complete access to cash 
accounting records. You can ask your CPA for help in devising ways to segregate 
physical custody of assets from accounting and bookkeeping duties. And you 
really, really should do this. Unfortunately, employee theft is very common.
»
» Train employees in the use of QuickBooks. You should train employees to 
use QuickBooks if you have a business of any size for two basic reasons:
•	 Someone who knows how to use QuickBooks is less likely to make inadvertent 
errors. QuickBooks isn’t difficult to use, but it’s also not something that you 
can learn willy-nilly with no help. Some transactions are pretty tricky, 
particularly for certain businesses. So if you can, it makes good sense to 
provide some employee help or training, or both. Those resources let 
people use QuickBooks’s features more comfortably and more accurately 
to build financial information that lets you manage your business better.
•	 Messy accounting records camouflage employee theft. Often, one thing you 
see when employee theft happens is really messed-up accounting records. 
For that reason, you can find yourself in a situation in which poorly trained 
employees create a messy accounting system that enables employee theft. 
So training means not only that you’ll have more accurate accounting 
records, but also that you’ll be less likely to have an environment conducive 
to theft or embezzlement.
»
» Close your QuickBooks file. If you take a Principles of Accounting course, 
you’ll discover that closing means a set of bookkeeping procedures that 
somebody performs to zero out revenue and expense accounts so that 
starting in the new year, revenue and expenses can be easily calculated. In 
QuickBooks, closing means something different. But you still want to close the 
QuickBooks file to maintain the integrity of your data. Here’s how: Choose the 
Edit➪  Preferences command, select Accounting, select the Company 
Preferences tab, and then click the Closing Date Set Date/Password button. 
When QuickBooks prompts you, specify a closing date and password. After 
you provide this information, QuickBooks prohibits or limits users from 
changing or entering transactions dated before the closing date. (Only people 
with the password can make changes to or enter transactions with dates 
earlier than the closing date.)
»
» Manage your QuickBooks accounting system. I’m sorry to report that many 
business owners don’t view the accounting system as being anything more 
than a tool to produce invoices, paychecks, and information required for the 
annual tax return. Unfortunately, that distant relationship with the accounting 
system means that business owners often don’t feel much need to actively 
manage what happens with the accounting system.

Administering 
QuickBooks
CHAPTER 1  Administering QuickBooks      489
In my opinion — an opinion based on more than 30 years of experience 
working as a CPA — this attitude is wrong. An accounting system should be a 
tool that you use to better manage your business. And it can be that. But if it’s 
going to be a tool for better managing your business, you need to manage the 
system. In other words, I respectfully suggest that you take responsibility for 
ensuring that employees are trained to do the things that protect your 
accounting system (such as backing up the data file) and that you ensure that 
they complete appropriate accounting procedures on a monthly and annual 
basis (such as sending out all invoices, reconciling bank accounts, cleaning up 
messy transactions, and so forth).
I don’t think that this management responsibility needs to be a heavy one. 
You can rather easily make sure that people are doing the sorts of things they 
are supposed to be doing by creating some simple checklists. Table 1-1 shows 
a sample monthly accounting to-do list. Table 1-2 shows a sample annual 
accounting to-do list. You can use these tables as starting points for construct-
ing your own list of things that the accounting clerk or office manager must do 
every month or at the end of every year.

CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      491
Protecting Your Data
I
n this chapter, I tell you how to protect your QuickBooks data. Principally, 
protecting your data requires that you back up the data. If you back up your 
data, you have a second copy available in case the original data file goes bad or 
becomes corrupted.
Because archiving and data file compression are related to backing up and restor-
ing QuickBooks data files, I also talk about archiving in this chapter. When you 
archive QuickBooks data files, you create a permanent record of the data files. You 
also have the option of condensing the current working data file.
Backing Up the QuickBooks Data File
A critically important task that either you or some co-worker needs to complete is 
a backup of the QuickBooks data file. I respectfully suggest that few items stored 
on your computer’s hard drive deserve as much caretaking as the QuickBooks 
data file does. Quite literally, the QuickBooks data file describes your business’s 
financial affairs. You absolutely don’t want to lose the data file. Losing the data 
file might mean that you don’t know how much money you have, you don’t know 
whether you’re making or losing money, and you won’t be able to easily or accu-
rately prepare your annual tax returns.

Backing-up basics
Fortunately, backing up the QuickBooks data file is rather straightforward. You 
need to complete only nine steps:
1.	 Choose the File ➪ Create Copy command.
QuickBooks displays the first Save Copy or Backup dialog box (see Figure 2-1), 
which provides three options: the option to save a backup copy of your 
QuickBooks file, the option to create a portable company file, and the option to 
create an accountant’s copy.
2.	 You want to save a backup copy, so select the Backup Copy option 
button; then click Next to continue.
You can create either a full backup file or a portable company file when you 
copy the QuickBooks file. A portable company file is smaller than a backup file, 
so it’s more convenient to move around. You can more easily email a portable 
company file, for example. The rub with portable company files is this: 
QuickBooks must work hard to scrunch the portable company file to a small 
size. QuickBooks also has to do more work to unscrunch the file later, when 
you want to work with it.
After you click Next, the second Save Copy or Backup dialog box, shown in 
Figure 2-2, appears.
You can go directly to the Save Copy or Backup dialog box by choosing the 
File ➪ Create Backup command.
FIGURE 2-1:  
The first Save 
Copy or Backup 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      493
3.	 Indicate whether you want to save your QuickBooks backup file on your 
company’s computer or to QuickBooks’s offsite data center.
Click Local Backup to indicate that you want to store the backup copy of your 
file on your computer’s hard disk or some removable storage device, such as a 
flash drive.
4.	 Click the Options button to choose a backup location.
QuickBooks displays the Backup Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3.
5.	 Specify the folder or disk location to which the company file should be 
backed up.
You just enter a pathname directly in the box to tell QuickBooks where to save 
your backup copies.
FIGURE 2-2:  
The second Save 
Copy or Backup  
dialog box.
FIGURE 2-3:  
The Backup 
Options  
dialog box.

494      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
If you don’t know how to enter a pathname, click the Browse button. When 
QuickBooks displays the Browse for Folder dialog box, use its folder list to 
select the disk or folder you want to use for QuickBooks backups.
6.	 (Optional) Select your backup options.
You can also use the Backup Options dialog box to specify when QuickBooks 
should remind you to back up and how QuickBooks should back up:
•	 Adding time stamps: To add the date and time of the backup operation to 
the backup file’s name, select the check box titled Add the Date and Time 
of the Backup to the File Name (Recommended).
•	 Limiting backup copies: To tell QuickBooks to get rid of old backup copies, 
select the check box titled Limit the Number of Backup Copies in This 
Folder to X and then specify how many backup copies you want to keep by 
using the adjoining text box.
•	 Setting backup reminders: Select the check box titled Remind Me to Back Up 
When I Close My Company File Every X Times to specify that you want to be 
reminded to back up the QuickBooks file when you close QuickBooks. Your 
interval options include every time, every other time, every third time, and 
so forth.
•	 Enabling data verification: Use the verification buttons to tell QuickBooks 
that it should check for data integrity when it backs up your data. Select the 
Complete Verification (Recommended) radio button for QuickBooks’s best 
and most comprehensive verification. If you’re someone who doesn’t have 
time for the extra few seconds of double-checking that data verification 
takes, sure, select the Quicker Verification radio button. Better yet, throw 
caution completely to the wind — caution is for babies anyway — and 
select the No Verification radio button.
7.	 Click OK when you finish specifying the backup location and options and 
then click Next.
QuickBooks displays a dialog box (see Figure 2-4) that asks when you want to 
back up.
8.	 Specify when you want to back up.
Typically, you want to back up when you choose the Save Copy or Backup com-
mand. In this case, when QuickBooks displays the Save Copy or Backup dialog box 
that asks the “when” question, click the Save It Now button. Alternatively, you can 
tell QuickBooks to schedule regular backups of the QuickBooks data file according 
to some clever scheme by — when QuickBooks asks the “when” question — clicking 
the Save It Now and Schedule Future Backups buttons or by clicking the Only 
Schedule Future Backups button. If you tell QuickBooks that you want to schedule 
backups, QuickBooks displays a couple of dialog boxes that you use to create the 
new backup schedule by naming the schedule and by setting the days and times 
when backups should be scheduled.

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      495
9.	 Click Finish to close the Save Copy or Backup dialog box.
When you’ve specified how the backup operation should work, click Finish. 
QuickBooks backs up (or creates a copy of) the current QuickBooks company 
file and stores that new file copy in the backup location.
What about online backup?
If you’re observant, you may have noticed that the Save Copy or Backup dialog 
box shown in Figure 2-2, earlier in this chapter, includes an Online Backup radio 
button. If you want to find out more about backing up the QuickBooks company 
data file online — which means using Intuit’s computer network rather than your 
computer or some removable disk to store the backup — you can select that radio 
button.
For what it’s worth, I strongly recommend that you consider using the online 
backup method, for two reasons:
»
» Reasonable cost: Online backup is extremely reasonable, with prices that 
run (at this writing) from free (if you signed up for the annual support or 
Enterprise support plan) to $25 a month. You can find yourself paying the 
higher figure if you back up all your computer’s files, which actually seems to 
be the best value!
»
» Less effort: Online backup can make the task of backing up less difficult and 
more regular as long as you have a reliable Internet connection. You don’t 
need to remember to back up and then remember to take the backup disc 
home.
Two final quick points: Yes, I use the online QuickBooks backup option myself 
(and to back up all my important files). No, Intuit doesn’t pay me some sort of 
secret commission to tout the product.
FIGURE 2-4:  
The Save Copy 
or Backup dialog 
box that asks 
when you want to 
back up.

496      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
You can store backup files in a folder that syncs with a cloud-based backup, such as 
Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft’s OneDrive. Each of these services offers a free 
set-and-forget, cloud-based backup if you use the free storage space offered by any 
of them. It’s definitely an option for users on a budget or with limited resources.
Some backup tactics
Backing up is mostly a matter of common sense. That being said, however, let me 
give you some ideas about how, when, and maybe why you should back up:
»
» Make it easy. I mention this in my recommendation concerning the online 
backup option, but the point deserves mention again. The most important 
thing you can do regarding QuickBooks data file backup is this: Make backing 
up easy. This probably means considering the online option, but if you do go 
local, you want to have a high-density, removable storage device that you can 
use with the computer you use to run QuickBooks. I use a stick-of-gum-size 
USB flash drive. Choose what device works best for you, but you definitely 
want some similarly easy-to-employ storage device. In this case, easy means 
that backing up is more likely to occur.
»
» Back up regularly. I recommend that you back up every time you enter 
transactions in the QuickBooks data file. Obviously, if backing up represents a 
lot of work, you won’t want to do it. But if you have an easy way to back up 
and a convenient storage device to back up to, you can — and should — back 
up regularly. Daily isn’t too often.
»
» Store a backup copy of the QuickBooks data file offsite. One final 
important point worth mentioning: Many of the events that may destroy or 
corrupt your data file are specific to your computer, such as a hard drive 
failure, a virus, a user accident, and so forth. Some of the events that may 
corrupt or destroy your QuickBooks data file, however, are location-specific. 
Fire, flood, or theft can cause you to lose the QuickBooks data file and its 
backup. For this reason, you want to store a copy of the backup offsite. At the 
end of the week, for example, you may want to pop the flash drive in your 
shirt pocket or purse and take it home. Make sure that if something corrupts 
or destroys the QuickBooks data file, that same something doesn’t also 
destroy the backup QuickBooks data file.
Restoring a QuickBooks Data File
If you find that the working copy of the QuickBooks data file becomes corrupted 
or gets destroyed, you need to restore the QuickBooks data file so that you can 

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      497
begin using QuickBooks again. Restoring the QuickBooks data file is easy if you’ve 
recently backed it up (see the preceding section).
If you haven’t recently (or ever) backed up the QuickBooks data file, you’ll have 
to restore the QuickBooks data file, which means starting over from scratch. This 
means, for example, rerunning QuickBooks Installation and Setup and reentering 
all the old data. In short, restoring without a backup copy of the QuickBooks data 
file means that you start over at square one.
To restore the QuickBooks data file from the backup copy of the file, put the 
backup disc into the drive or plug in the flash drive and then follow these steps:
1.	 Launch QuickBooks, and choose the File ➪ Open or Restore Company 
command.
QuickBooks displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 2-5.
2.	 Indicate what type of file you want to restore.
You can open a regular QuickBooks data file, restore a backup copy of the 
regular QuickBooks file or a portable version of the file, or convert an accoun-
tant’s copy transfer file. If you want to restore a backup copy, predictably, you 
select the radio button labeled Restore a Backup Copy.
3.	 Click Next.
QuickBooks displays another version of the Open or Restore Company dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 2-6.
FIGURE 2-5:  
The Open or 
Restore Company 
dialog box.

498      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
4.	 Tell QuickBooks whether the backup copy is stored at your company or 
at QuickBooks’s offsite data center.
To do this, you just select the radio button that labels your backup copy file’s 
location.
5.	 Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Open Backup Copy dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-7.
6.	 Double-click the backup file that you’ll use for the restoration.
Specify the location of and then the specific backup file that you’ll use for the 
restoration. You can use the Look In drop-down list to identify the disk and 
folder storing the backup file.
7.	 Click Next.
QuickBooks displays yet another version of the Open or Restore Company 
dialog box (not shown), which simply tells you that QuickBooks is about to ask 
FIGURE 2-6:  
The Open or 
Restore Company 
dialog box that 
asks where you’ve 
backed up.
FIGURE 2-7:  
The Open Backup 
Copy dialog box.

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      499
you where you want to store the newly restored file. (Er, the fact that 
QuickBooks needs to tell you that it’s about to ask a question seems a little 
strange, but let’s not get bogged down with that.)
When you restore the company data file by using the backup copy, you destroy 
the current working version of the file. In other words, QuickBooks takes the 
backup copy and copies it over the to-be-restored company data file. Therefore, 
before you restore company data files, make sure that you’re using the right 
backup copy and that you’re overwriting the corrupted, to-be-restored 
company file.
If you’re uncomfortable deleting or overwriting the old (possibly corrupted) 
QuickBooks data file, you can use a new filename for the restored file. You do 
this as part of Step 9.
8.	 Click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Save Company File As dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-8.
9.	 Tell QuickBooks where it should restore the backup copy and then  
click Save.
Use the Save Company File As dialog box to pick a location for the backed up 
file. You’ll probably pick the same location as the existing file. If you do this 
and also use the same name for the QuickBooks file, QuickBooks displays a 
message asking you to confirm that you want to overwrite the existing file. You 
click Yes. After you click Yes, QuickBooks displays another message box titled 
Delete Entire File. Confirm that you want to delete the existing (and presum-
ably corrupt) company data file by typing the word yes in the message box. 
Then click OK. QuickBooks uses the backup copy to overwrite the to-be- 
restored company file. Again, however, note that you can also choose to use a 
new filename for the restored file.
FIGURE 2-8:  
The Save 
­Company File  
As dialog box.

500      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
You’re now free of the rather persistent dialog boxes. Whew.
Note: If you restore your QuickBooks data file in a newer version of 
QuickBooks than the version you used to create the backup copy, QuickBooks 
displays a dialog box that asks whether you’re okay with the fact that the 
company file will be updated for the new version. In this case, you confirm by 
checking a box that says (in essence), “Hey man, I understand that my com-
pany file will be updated to the new version.”
10.	Enter any transactions that took place since your last backup.
If you entered transactions after you last backed up the QuickBooks company 
file, you now reenter those transactions in QuickBooks. If you last backed up 
QuickBooks on Friday of last week, for example, you need to reenter any 
transactions that you’ve created since last Friday.
Condensing the QuickBooks  
Company Files
The QuickBooks file condense process does two things:
»
» The QuickBooks Condense command creates a permanent copy of the 
QuickBooks data file. (This copy is called an archival copy of the file.) An 
archival copy of the company file amounts to a snapshot of the company file 
as it exists at a particular point in time. If somebody later has a question — 
perhaps your accountant, or a federal or state auditor — you can use the 
archival copy of the data file to show what the company file looked like at a 
particular point in time.
»
» The file condense process makes the data file smaller by summarizing many 
old closed, detailed transactions that use monster journal entries.
Because this condensing and archiving can be a little bit confusing, let me quickly 
summarize exactly what happens when you condense the QuickBooks company 
file. Here’s what QuickBooks typically does during the process:
»
» Saves an archive copy of your company files: When you condense the 
QuickBooks company file, QuickBooks saves an archival copy of that file.
»
» Removes closed transactions: As part of the condense process, QuickBooks 
gives you the opportunity to remove old, closed transactions from the current, 
working version of the QuickBooks company file. Remember that archiving 
creates an archival copy of the QuickBooks company file. You still have the 
working version of the QuickBooks company file, however, and it’s this 

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      501
current, working version of the QuickBooks company file that gets cleaned up, 
or condensed, by the removal of old, closed transactions.
Closed transactions are transactions that QuickBooks no longer needs to track 
in detail. An old customer invoice — after it’s been paid — is a closed transac-
tion. An old check written to some vendor — after it’s cleared the bank — is a 
closed transaction.
»
» Summarizes closed transactions: Because the old, closed transactions are 
removed from the QuickBooks data file, condensing typically creates summary 
monthly journal entries for the old, closed transactions and places these 
summary transactions in the current, working version of the QuickBooks data 
file. These summary monthly journal entries allow you to continue to prepare 
monthly financial statements. Even though archiving removes all the old, 
closed transactions from, say, January 2011, you can still produce financial 
statements for January 2011 in 2017. To produce monthly financial statements 
for January 2011, QuickBooks uses the summary monthly journal entries.
»
» Clears the audit trail: As I mention in Book 7, Chapter 1, QuickBooks 
maintains an audit trail showing who has entered what transactions. One 
almost-hidden effect of the cleanup of the QuickBooks data files concerns the 
audit trail. If you clean up a company file and indicate that the company file 
should be condensed, QuickBooks clears the audit trail before the “removed 
closed transactions on or before” date. In other words, for the period of time 
in which QuickBooks removes old, closed transactions, it also removes the 
audit trail of those transactions.
The condense file process typically means creating a copy of the QuickBooks data 
file that you put away someplace and then creating a scaled-down version of the 
working company file. The command that you use to condense the QuickBooks 
company file, however, also allows you to create almost-empty company files. 
Most people never need to use this option. I can think of only one category of 
QuickBooks users who may want to create almost-empty company files: CPAs and 
consultants (who want to reuse a company file for another business unit or client) 
may want to use this command to create company data files that have many of the 
lists set up already. I don’t go into any further detail on creating an almost-empty 
company file by using the archiving command, but you should know that it’s there.
Cleanup basics
When you understand what archiving is all about, the process is quite straightfor-
ward. To condense the QuickBooks company file, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the File ➪ Utilities ➪ Condense Data command.
QuickBooks displays the first Condense Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-9.

502      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
2.	 Select the Transactions Before a Specific Date radio button.
This option tells QuickBooks that you want to do two things: create an archival 
copy of the QuickBooks data file, and skinny down the working company file so 
that it isn’t so big. QuickBooks reduces the size of the working version of the 
company data file by removing old, closed transactions if you choose in Step 3 
to remove transactions.
3.	 Specify the Remove Transactions Before date.
To specify the date before which closed transactions should be removed, enter 
the date in the date box. If you want to condense the file by removing transac-
tions on or before December 31, 2016, for example, enter 1/1/2017 in the 
date box. You don’t need to feel compulsive about removing a bunch of 
closed transactions, however. You remove closed transactions only if your 
QuickBooks company file is getting too big. You can easily work with a 
QuickBooks company file that’s 25MB, 50MB, or even 100MB (megabytes).
Although typically, you condense a QuickBooks file by removing old, closed 
transactions, the Condense command also creates files without transactions 
and files with only a specified data range of transactions. To create a file that 
holds lists and preferences but no transactions, select the All Transactions 
radio button. By the way, you might use the All Transactions option to build a 
nearly empty file that you could reuse (such as for training). To create a 
QuickBooks file that holds a specified range of transactions, select the 
Transactions Outside of a Date Range radio button and then enter the dates 
that bookend the range in the Before and After boxes.
4.	 Click Next when you finish specifying which transactions QuickBooks 
should remove.
QuickBooks displays the second Condense Data dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 2-10.
FIGURE 2-9:  
The first 
­Condense Data 
dialog box.

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      503
5.	 Specify how transactions should be summarized.
If you want to summarize historical transactions, QuickBooks uses a second 
Condense Data dialog box to ask how it should summarize historical data: with 
a single summary journal entry, with monthly summary journal entries, or no 
summary at all. Select the radio button that corresponds to the summarization 
approach you want. (Usually, you use the second option listed — having 
QuickBooks create monthly summary journal entries — so you can still 
generate meaningful comparative monthly reports.)
6.	 Click Next when you finish specifying how QuickBooks should summarize 
transactions.
QuickBooks displays the third Condense Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-11.
7.	 Specify how inventory transactions should be condensed, and click Next.
If your QuickBooks file includes inventory transactions, QuickBooks recom-
mends that you remove old inventory transactions. When QuickBooks displays 
the third Condense Data dialog box, you can tell QuickBooks to do just this by 
FIGURE 2-10:  
The second 
­Condense Data 
dialog box.
FIGURE 2-11:  
The third 
­Condense Data 
dialog box.

504      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
selecting the Summarize Inventory Transactions (Recommended) radio button. 
(If you don’t want to remove old transactions, select the Keep Inventory 
Transaction Details radio button.)
When you click Next, you continue to the fourth Condense Data dialog box (not 
shown), which asks which transactions should considered closed.
8.	 Specify which transactions should be removed, and click Next.
QuickBooks asks for a bit more information about exactly what constitutes a 
closed or old transaction that should be removed. You select check boxes to 
indicate whether transactions before the removal date should be removed even 
if they’re uncleared, marked To Be Printed, flagged as To Be Sent, and so on.
When you click Next, you move on to the fifth Condense Data dialog box (see 
Figure 2-12).
9.	 Specify any list cleanup that should occur, and click Next.
Use the fifth Condense Data dialog box to tell QuickBooks that in addition to 
removing old closed transactions, it should clean up some of the lists. You can 
select check boxes that tell QuickBooks to remove unused accounts, unused 
customers, unused vendors, and so forth. By cleaning up your list through the 
removal of unused list items, you not only reduce the size of the company file, 
but also make it easier for people to work with the list.
When you click Next, QuickBooks displays the sixth Condense Data dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 2-13. The dialog box tells you that the archival process 
begins with QuickBooks making a copy of the data file and that the condensa-
tion operation may take several minutes or even several hours to complete.
FIGURE 2-12:  
The fifth 
­Condense Data 
dialog box.

Protecting Your Data
CHAPTER 2  Protecting Your Data      505
10.	Click Begin Condense.
QuickBooks begins the process of condensing the data file.
11.	Back up the data file when prompted.
At the beginning of the condense process, QuickBooks prompts you to back 
up the QuickBooks company file. Backing up the QuickBooks company file as 
part of a condense operation works the same as backing up the QuickBooks 
company file at any other time. If you have questions about how to back up the 
QuickBooks company file, refer to “Backing-up basics” earlier in this chapter.
After you back up the QuickBooks company file, QuickBooks saves an archive 
copy of the company file and then cleans up the working version of the company 
file by using your instructions. Again, as noted in the earlier steps, the cleanup 
process may take only a few minutes, or it may take several hours if your file is 
very large.
Some cleanup and archiving strategies
Deciding when and how you want to clean up or archive your QuickBooks com-
pany file is mostly a matter of common sense. Your first consideration should be 
whether you need to condense the company file at all. If QuickBooks still runs 
at a reasonable speed, if you don’t find yourself going crazy because of many 
unused items in lists, or if the data file hasn’t grown monstrously large (larger 
than 100MB or so), you may not need to condense. In many cases, you achieve no 
benefit by cleaning up. And by not cleaning up, you still have complete, detailed 
financial records at your fingertips.
My technical editor wants me to point something out here: He notes that running 
a cleanup operation doesn’t necessarily reduce the size of the QuickBooks data 
file. He says, therefore, that if you really must have a smaller data file, you should 
first run a cleanup operation and then save and restore a portable QuickBooks 
data file.
FIGURE 2-13:  
The sixth 
­Condense Data 
dialog box.

506      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
Here’s another common-sense notion about cleaning up and archiving the Quick-
Books company files: You should create an archival copy of the QuickBooks data 
file. In fact, I recommend that you create an archival copy of the QuickBooks data 
file at the end of the year, after you or your CPA make any final adjustments to the 
year. It’s a great idea to create an archival copy of the QuickBooks data file that’s 
used to prepare your tax return and any financial statements, because you can 
always later explain some number in a tax return or financial statement by look-
ing at the archival copy of the data file.
Throughout this book — and most recently in Book 7, Chapter 1, which discusses 
administering QuickBooks  — I mention that one of the problems with using 
QuickBooks is that people can intentionally or inadvertently change old trans-
actions. This means, unfortunately, that someone can change transactions in a 
QuickBooks data file in a previous year. When that change occurs, someone who 
looks at the QuickBooks data file later may not be able to explain a number in a 
tax return or a financial statement. If someone goes back to change a transaction 
in a previous year, and that transaction is used to calculate total revenue for the 
year, you can no longer use the QuickBooks data to explain numbers on your tax 
return and your financial statements for total revenue. That makes sense, right?
Fortunately, by having an archival copy of the QuickBooks data file  — the 
­QuickBooks data file that supplied numbers to your tax return and the financial 
statements — you can always see which QuickBooks transactions support a par-
ticular tax return number or financial statement number. If you’re still confused 
about this point — and it is a little bit tricky — ask your tax adviser or your CPA 
about the problem. He or she can explain to you the danger of having a change in 
QuickBooks data that has been used to prepare a return or a financial statement 
after that return has been prepared, or after those financial statements have been 
published and distributed.

CHAPTER 3  Troubleshooting      507
Troubleshooting
A
fter writing about QuickBooks for more than 20 years, I’ve had a revelation 
of sorts: People want not only specific, step-by-step information about 
how to use the program, but also troubleshooting advice. They want tech-
niques and tactics that they can use to solve the inevitable problems that they 
encounter while using QuickBooks in real-life settings. What follows is my list of 
the best troubleshooting techniques.
Using the QuickBooks Help 
File and This Book
I know what you may be thinking: You have some problem that you can’t solve 
by  using Help, and it’s either a bug or some glaring error in the QuickBooks 
­documentation. You’ve looked through this book, of course, but it says nothing — 
absolutely nothing — about your question. In fact, upon further reflection, you 
may be thinking that you’ve encountered some problem that you can’t possibly 
solve by consulting the QuickBooks Help file or this book.

508      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
Maybe you’re right.
But in my experience (gleaned from talking with people who have problems), 
about half the time, the problem is lack of knowledge about QuickBooks. These 
users may simply be experiencing a mechanical problem. They can’t make the 
program work because they haven’t used QuickBooks enough to figure out  
the problem. Therefore, the right way to solve this sort of problem is to find out 
more about QuickBooks and try again. If you’re having problems printing a report, 
for example, just finding out more about both printing and reports may enable 
you to solve the problem.
In most cases, you should be able to find the information in this book by using the 
index or the table of contents.
Also, you usually can find the information (perhaps in a slightly less-friendly 
form) in the QuickBooks Help file. To find information in the QuickBooks Help 
file, choose Help➪  QuickBooks Help to display the QuickBooks Help window, as 
shown in Figure 3-1.
FIGURE 3-1:  
The QuickBooks 
Help window.

Troubleshooting
CHAPTER 3  Troubleshooting      509
Enter the word or phrase that you want to look up in the search box at the top 
of the Help window and then click the button that looks like a magnifying glass. 
QuickBooks displays a list of clickable links that may help you with whatever 
problem you’re having. Figure 3-2 shows a list of Help topics related to the issue 
of working in a multiple-currencies situation.
Browsing Intuit’s Product-Support Website
Another really good resource for troubleshooting is Intuit’s product-support 
website for QuickBooks. This website (see Figure  3-3), which you can visit by 
entering http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com in your web browser or by 
choosing the Help➪  Support command within QuickBooks, is a rich database of 
troubleshooting information.
To use the site, enter your question or keywords from your question in the search 
box at the top of the window and then click Search. The product-support website 
displays a list of troubleshooting articles that may help solve your problem (see 
Figure 3-4).

Troubleshooting
CHAPTER 3  Troubleshooting      511
Checking Another Vendor’s  
Product-Support Website
Keep in mind that your problem may not be a problem with QuickBooks at all, but 
a problem with your computer and its hardware or with Microsoft Windows. The 
Microsoft product-support website, which is phenomenally rich in information, 
is available at http://support.microsoft.com.
If your problem stems from the hardware or the operating system, you can consult 
the hardware or software maker’s product-support website for troubleshooting 
information. Usually, you can find the hardware maker’s product-support website 
easily by using a good Internet search engine. To locate Dell Computer’s product-
support website, for example, type something like Dell Computer ­product support 
in a search engine such as www.google.com. When the search engine searches 
on that phrase, it almost inevitably finds the URL (the address) of the vendor’s 
product-support web page.
You can find troubleshooting information about Intuit products at the Microsoft 
product-support website. If the solutions that the site offers aren’t very reas-
suring, at least you can find out whether other users have experienced the same 
problem. Microsoft may simply suggest that you contact the vendor (Intuit, in this 
case) or that you upgrade to a newer version of the QuickBooks software. Often, 
however, it’s useful simply to know that the problem you’ve encountered is a real 
problem that Microsoft has logged into its product-support Knowledge Base and 
described in some technical detail.
Tapping into Intuit’s Online 
and Expert Communities
In addition to the option of using the Intuit product-support website, you can get 
direct product support in at least two other ways:
»
» Online community: Visit the https://community.intuit.com/quickbooks- 
desktop website to connect with a huge group of usually friendly QuickBooks 
users. If you sign into the website with your QuickBooks sign-on credentials —  
the same ones you use to register — you can not only view other questions and 
answers, but also ask your own questions. (After you’ve used QuickBooks for a 
while, maybe you can even answer some other users’ questions!)

512      BOOK 7  Care and Maintenance
»
» Professional adviser: You can contact a QuickBooks professional adviser via 
the QuickBooks website. In a nutshell, QuickBooks professional advisers are 
people (often, accountants and consultants) who signed up with Intuit to get 
copies of the QuickBooks software at a discount price, a listing on the 
QuickBooks product-support website, and access to special training. (Some of 
these people also take a test and pay extra money to be listed as certified 
advisers.) You pay these professional advisers their usual consulting fees, but 
let me suggest that this support option can be very useful when your problem 
isn’t so much a technical problem with QuickBooks as it is a problem with how 
to use QuickBooks to solve some accounting issue. To contact a QuickBooks 
professional adviser, visit http://proadvisor.intuit.com/referral.
When All Else Fails . . .
If you try at least a few of the preceding troubleshooting tactics and can’t get an 
answer, I have one other suggestion: Bite the bullet, call your CPA, and get him or 
her to help you through the rough patches.
I know. You’re going to pay $200 an hour or whatever. And you paid, what, only 
a few hundred bucks for QuickBooks in the first place? But here’s the deal: Your 
accounting system is an essential business tool. It must work smoothly and cor-
rectly to produce the information you need to operate your business successfully. 
Paying for an hour or two of expert, onsite, personalized accounting expertise can 
be a great investment.
And what if your accountant doesn’t or can’t provide this sort of assistance? Well, 
shoot, I think you should find somebody who does and can.

APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      515
A Crash Course 
in Excel
In this appendix, I review the basic Microsoft Excel skills that you may need to 
get the most benefit from some chapters in this book. If you plan to download and 
work with the sample workbooks from my website, www.stephenlnelson.com, 
you need some of the skills that this primer covers.
If you’ve used Excel much — even for just a few weeks — you probably possess 
all these skills. Nevertheless, if you’re even a teensy bit concerned about whether 
you have the right skills, take the time to read this appendix.
Note: I used Excel 2016 and Windows 10 when writing this appendix. If you’re 
using an earlier or later version of Excel, you may notice some slight differences 
between the images that appear here and what you see on your monitor. If you 
need detailed guidance, pick up Excel 2016 For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Starting Excel
You can start Excel in two ways, neither of which requires a PhD in physics. You 
can click the Start button and then click the Excel tile that appears on the Start 
menu’s list of programs, or you can open an Excel workbook.
If you’re going to use the Excel tile, you simply find the Excel tile (you may need 
to scroll around the Start menu’s list of tiles) and then click it.
To start Excel by opening an Excel workbook, you select the workbook from a 
menu or in a folder window. You commonly see documents, including Excel work-
books, listed on menus — both Windows menus and Program menus. If Windows 
displays the list of documents in a folder window, for example (see Figure A-1), 
you can open the workbook by double-clicking it. When you open an Excel work-
book, Windows starts Excel and tells it to open the workbook.

516      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Stopping Excel
To stop Excel, click the Excel window’s Close box. When you stop Excel, Excel 
closes any of the open Excel workbooks before it stops.
The Close box is the button marked with an X that appears in the top-right corner 
of the Excel window.
Explaining Excel’s Workbooks
After you start Excel, it displays an empty workbook with one worksheet in its 
document window. Figure A-2 shows a picture of this empty workbook.
An Excel workbook is just a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is comprised of numbered 
rows and lettered columns. You see the row numbers along the left edge of the 
spreadsheet, and you see the lettered columns along the top edge of the spread-
sheet. The first row is numbered 1, the second is numbered 2, and so on. The first 
column is labeled with the letter A, the second column is labeled with the letter B, 
and so on.
FIGURE A-1:  
A folder that 
shows an Excel 
workbook.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      517
The intersections of rows and columns are called cells. A cell location is described 
by using the column letter and row number. The cell in the top-left corner of the 
workbook, for example, is labeled A1.
Putting Text, Numbers,  
and Formulas in Cells
You build a workbook, or spreadsheet, by entering text labels, numbers, and for-
mulas in the cells that comprise a workbook. The following list details these items:
»
» Text labels include letters and numbers that you don’t want to use in 
calculations. Your name, some budget expense description, and a telephone 
number are examples of text labels. None of these pieces of information is 
used in calculations.
»
» Numbers, or values, are bits of data that you may want to use later in a 
calculation. The actual amount that you budgeted for some expense, for 
example, will always be a number or value.
FIGURE A-2:  
The Excel window 
with an empty 
workbook.

518      BOOK 8  Appendixes
»
» Formulas are also entered into worksheet cells. If you enter =2+2 into a cell, 
Excel doesn’t display the formula. Rather, it calculates the formula result and 
displays that. The formula is what is actually stored in the cell, but the formula 
result is displayed.
This business about formulas going into workbook cells is, essentially, the 
heart of Excel. Even if an Excel workbook did nothing else, it would still be an 
extremely valuable tool. In fact, the first spreadsheet programs did little more 
than calculate cell formulas.
To enter a text label, a value, or a formula into a cell, all you do is click the cell by 
using the mouse and then type the text label, value, or formula. When you press 
Enter or click another cell, Excel enters your label, value, or formula into the cell. 
That’s all it takes.
Writing Formulas
In the preceding section, I tell you about formulas and even show you a simple 
formula example. But to use formulas practically, you need to possess several 
other pieces of knowledge. Specifically, you need to remember several things 
about entering formulas into the cells of a workbook:
»
» Formulas should begin with the equal sign (=). The equal sign tells Excel 
that what follows is a formula that it should calculate.
»
» You can use any of the standard arithmetic operators in your formulas. To 
add numbers, use the addition sign (+). To subtract numbers, use the subtrac-
tion operator (–). To multiply numbers, use the multiplication operator (*). To 
divide numbers, use the division operator (/). You can also perform exponential 
operations by using the exponential operator (^).
»
» You aren’t limited to using values in your formulas. You can also use cell 
addresses. When you use a cell address in a formula, Excel uses the value or 
formula result from that cell in the calculation. If cell A1 holds the value 2, and 
cell B1 holds the value 2, the formula =A1+B1 returns the value 4. In other 
words, this formula is equivalent to =2+2.
»
» Remember standard rules of operator precedence when you build compli-
cated formulas. As you may remember from junior-high math, exponential 
operations are performed first. Multiplication and division operations are 
performed second. Addition and subtraction operations are performed third. 
To override these standard rules of operator precedence, you place the 
operations that you want performed first inside parentheses. Table A-1 shows 
some example formulas and the formula results to illustrate these rules of 
­precedence. If you get the rules wrong, you’ll have to stay after class.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      519
Scrolling through Big Workbooks
The cells that you see inside the Excel program window represent only a small por-
tion of the Excel workbook. An Excel workbook actually provides more: 1,048,576 
rows and, oh, about 16,000 columns.
Because the alphabet provides only 26 letters, a new naming scheme is needed, 
starting in column 27. Excel labels the 27th and subsequent columns by using two 
letters. The 27th column is labeled AA, the 28th column is labeled AB, and the 29th 
is labeled AC. This scheme goes all the way through the 702nd column, which is 
labeled ZZ.
Taking it up a notch, Excel labels the 703rd and subsequent columns by using 
three letters. The 703rd column is labeled AAA, the 704th column is labeled AAB, 
the 705th column is labeled AAC, and so on. The last, or rightmost, column in an 
Excel workbook is labeled XFD.
You can scroll the viewable portion of the Excel worksheet in several ways:
»
» Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars that appear along the bottom 
edge and at the right edge of the worksheet window. You can click the 
scroll bar, drag the scroll marker, and click the scroll-bar arrow buttons that 
appear at either end of the scroll bar. If you’re not familiar with how scroll 
bars work, take the time to experiment and see what they do.
»
» Scroll the viewable portion of the Excel worksheet by moving the cell 
selector. The cell selector is the dark rectangular border that Excel uses to 
mark the active cell. The active cell is the cell in which whatever you type gets 
placed. You can move the cell selector by pressing the arrow keys; Excel 
moves the cell selector in the direction of the arrow. If you aren’t sure what 
the cell selector is, press the arrow keys a bunch of times. See that rectangle 
that jumps around? That’s the cell selector.

to see what I mean. Press the Page Down key a few times. Press the Page Up 
key a few times. Now you got it.
You have several other ways to scroll within a worksheet. If you’re really inter-
ested, you may want to look up the other scrolling methods in Excel’s online 
Help or get a good book like a recent edition of Excel For Dummies, by Greg Harvey 
(Wiley).
Copying and Cutting Cell Contents
You can easily copy and paste contents of worksheet cells, and you want to do both 
of these things because worksheet construction becomes much easier when you 
use these skills.
Copying cell contents
To copy cell contents, follow these steps:
1.	 Select the cells that you want to copy.
To select a single cell, click that cell. To select a range of cells — a range is just a 
group of contiguous cells — click the cell in the top-left corner and then drag 
the mouse to the cell in the bottom-right corner of the range.
2.	 Copy the selection by clicking the Copy icon.
First, if necessary, click the Home tab on the Ribbon to display the Home icons. 
(You may need to do this because the Copy icon, which you use for copying, 
appears on the Home tab.) Excel places a copy of the contents of the selection 
on the Office Clipboard, which is a temporary storage area.
Note: The Copy icon looks like two miniature duplicated documents.
3.	 Select the location where you want to place the copied data.
To tell Excel where you want to put the selection, click the cell in the top-left 
corner of the range into which you want to copy the data.
4.	 Paste the copied range selection by clicking the Paste icon.
Excel copies the previously copied range selection from the Office Clipboard to 
the workbook location that you identify in Step 3.
Note: The Paste icon looks like a clipboard with a piece of paper attached.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      521
Moving cell contents
You can move, or cut, the contents of cells and ranges by following these steps:
1.	 Select the cells that you want to move.
To select a single cell, click that cell. To select a range of cells, click the cell in the 
top-left corner and then drag the mouse to the cell in the bottom-right corner.
2.	 Choose the Cut command.
You tell Excel that you want to cut your selection by clicking the Cut icon that 
appears on the Home tab on the Ribbon. When you choose the Cut command, 
Excel moves the contents of the selection to the Office Clipboard. Again, if 
you can’t see the Cut icon, click the Home tab on the Ribbon to display the 
Home icons.
Note: The Cut icon looks like a pair of scissors.
3.	 Select the location where you want to place the data you’re moving.
To tell Excel where to move the selection, click the cell in the top-left corner of 
the range into which you want to move the data.
4.	 Paste the data by choosing the Paste command.
Alternatively, you can click the Paste toolbar button. When you do, Excel copies 
the previously copied range selection from the Office Clipboard to the 
workbook location that you identify in Step 3.
Moving and copying formulas
You can move and copy formulas the same way that you move and copy other 
stuff stored in cells. You need to know something really important about copying 
formulas, however: Excel adjusts the cell addresses used in a formula when you 
copy the cell or cells that store the formula.
This sounds very strange, but let me show you a quick example of how this adjust-
ment occurs. You’ll see immediately why the adjustment is useful. Take a look at 
the simple budgeting workbook shown in Figure A-3. As you can see, this simple 
spreadsheet calculates totals for a budget. The totals appear in row 6. Because 
Excel adjusts cell addresses when it copies them, if you copy the formula in cell B6 
to cells C6 and D6, Excel ends up placing the correct formula in cells C6 and D6.
In cell B6, the formula is =B2+B3+B4+B5. This formula sums the values for the 
first month. Obviously, however, you don’t want to use this formula in cell C6. 
Excel guesses that this is the case when it copies the formula from B6. What Excel 
places in cell C6, therefore, is the formula =C2+C3+C4+C5. What Excel places in cell 
D6 is the formula =D2+D3+D4+D5.

522      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Excel doesn’t adjust the cell addresses in formulas in a range selection when you 
move cell contents. The adjustment of cell addresses and formulas occurs only 
when you copy formulas.
You can flag, or mark, those cell addresses that you don’t want adjusted when they’re 
copied. To do this, you precede the column letter and row number with a dollar 
sign ($) to tell Excel that the address shouldn’t be adjusted. If the cell address $A$1 is 
used in a formula, for example, Excel won’t adjust the column letter or row number 
if it copies the formula. Excel calls these fixed cell addresses absolute references. You 
can also tell Excel to adjust only one portion of the cell address by using the ­dollar 
sign ($) in front of only the column letter or the row number. If the cell address A$1 
is used in a formula, Excel adjusts the column letter but not the row number.
Formatting Cell Contents
Excel allows you to format the contents of the cells in a worksheet. You can choose 
the font, the point size, and special effects such as boldfacing, underlining, or 
italics for a workbook or a range.
For values and formula results, you can also add standard punctuation, including dol-
lar signs, percentage symbols, decimal points, and commas for separating thousands.
FIGURE A-3:

worksheet 
that budgets 
expenses.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      523
In general, you format a cell or range by selecting the range and then using the 
Home tab’s formatting boxes and buttons or by opening the Format Cells dialog 
box (which you do by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F).
When you point to an icon, button, or box, Excel displays the item’s name in a box 
next to the item. A bit of poking around, then, quickly lets you figure out which 
boxes and buttons are which.
The Home tab on the Ribbon, for example, provides a font box that you can use to 
select the font for the selected range. The Home tab also provides a Font Size box 
for specifying the point size of text and numbers in the selected range.
The Format Cells dialog box provides tabs of boxes and buttons for formatting the 
contents of cells. If you want to change the font used in a range selection, click 
the Format Cells: Font icon and then use the Font tab’s boxes and buttons to make 
your changes. The Format Cells: Font icon is the little arrow in the bottom-right 
corner of the Font section on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Figure A-4 shows the Font 
tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
Recognizing That Functions  
Are Simply Formulas
Here’s another important tidbit to know about Excel: Although you can construct 
very complicated formulas by using the standard arithmetic operators, Excel pro-
vides prefabricated formulas called functions that make it easy to calculate stan-
dard measurements. Excel provides a function to easily calculate an arithmetic 
FIGURE A-4:  
The Font tab of 
the Format Cells 
dialog box.

524      BOOK 8  Appendixes
mean, or average, for example. It also provides a function to calculate the payment 
on a car loan.
A simple example demonstrates how this works. If you look back at the worksheet 
shown in Figure A-3, you can see (or guess) that the formula in cell B6 adds the 
values in B2, B3, B4, and B5. With what you already know about Excel formulas, 
you can construct a total formula that adds these values. You can enter the for-
mula =B2+B3+B4+B5 into cell B6.
If you look closely at the area that’s just below the Excel Ribbon (Microsoft’s name 
for Excel’s menu), you can see what’s known as the formula bar. The formula bar 
shows you the contents of the selected cell. In Figure A-3, the selected cell is B6, 
so the formula bar shows you the contents of cell B6, which happens to be the 
formula that adds the values in cells B2, B3, B4, and B5.
You can also use a function to make this calculation. To add a series of values, you 
use the SUM function. Then you include as function arguments, or function inputs, 
the individual values, individual cell addresses, or range selections. To see how 
this works in the case of the worksheet shown in Figure A-5, you can enter the 
formula =SUM(B2:B5) into cell B6.
Function formulas use a standard set of conventions:
»
» The first part of this formula is the equal sign (=). Because functions are 
formulas, you begin a function with an equal sign.
»
» The next part of the function formula gives the function name. In the case of 
the SUM function, the function name is SUM.
»
» The third part of the formula function includes the function inputs, or 
arguments, inside parentheses. In the worksheet shown in Figure A-5, the 
inputs are included as a range reference (B2:B5).
FIGURE A-5:  
A worksheet that 
sums numbers.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      525
Sometimes, functions are so simple that you won’t need any help remembering 
how the arguments should appear or what arguments the function needs. The SUM 
function, for example, is one that spreadsheet users construct so frequently that 
they usually memorize its syntax after only a few uses.
Other functions, however, such as the functions to calculate a loan payment, 
require several arguments in a particular order. For more complicated functions, 
you typically want to use the Insert Function command. To use the Insert Func-
tion command, click the Formulas tab and then click the Insert Function icon. 
(The icon shows a little fx label and is located just to the left of the formula bar.) 
Excel displays the Insert Function dialog box, as shown in Figure A-6.
If you don’t know what function you want, you can type a brief description of 
whatever you want to calculate in the Search for a Function text box, shown at 
the top of the dialog box, and click Go. Alternatively, you can select a category of 
functions from the Or Select a Category drop-down list. This list provides sev-
eral categories of functions, including financial functions, date and time func-
tions, mathematical and trigonometric functions, statistical functions, and text 
functions.
Based on what you type in the first text box or based on the category that you select 
from the drop-down list, Excel displays a list of possible functions in the bottom 
portion of the Insert Function dialog box. You search this list for the function that 
you want. If you select a function in the list, Excel displays a brief description of 
the function and shows the arguments needed for the function to calculate.
After you find and select the function that you want to use, click OK. Excel displays 
the Function Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure A-7. The Function Argu-
ments dialog box provides text boxes that you use to supply the arguments, or 
inputs, to the function. Function arguments can be values or cell addresses.
FIGURE A-6:  
The first Insert 
Function 
­dialog box.

526      BOOK 8  Appendixes
After you supply the needed function arguments, click OK. Excel enters a formula 
function into the active cell by using the function name and function arguments 
that you provided.
As I mention earlier, after you know a function’s arguments, you can type the 
function directly in cells. To do this, click in the cell; then type the equal sign, the 
function name, and then the beginning parenthesis [(]. Excel displays a pop-up 
box that names the arguments (just to remind you of their order). You enter each 
of the arguments, separating individual arguments with commas. After you type 
the last argument, type the ending parenthesis [)] and then press Enter.
Saving and Opening Workbooks
As you may expect if you’ve worked with other Microsoft Office applications, such 
as Microsoft Word, Excel saves and opens its workbook documents in a predict-
able way.
Saving a workbook
To save a workbook, choose File  ➪  Save. The first time that you want to save a 
workbook, you choose either File  ➪  Save or File  ➪  Save As. In either case, Excel dis-
plays the Save As window (not shown), which asks where you want to save your 
workbook, and you pick the storage location you want to use. If you click More 
Options, Excel displays the traditional Save As dialog box, shown in Figure A-8.
You enter a name for the workbook by using the File Name box. Typically, you 
don’t have to worry about any of the other buttons or boxes on the Save As dialog 
box. You simply click the Save button. Excel saves your workbook in a specified 
location by using the specified name.
FIGURE A-7:  
The Function 
Arguments 
­dialog box.

A Crash Course in Excel
APPENDIX A  A Crash Course in Excel      527
After you save a workbook for the first time, you can save the workbook again 
simply by choosing File  ➪  Save again. When you do, Excel saves the workbook, 
using the same name and the same location.
If you want to save a copy of the workbook in a new location or use a new name, 
you choose File  ➪  Save As. Excel displays some recent folders you may have used, 
so click the folder you want to save it to, if you see it. If you don’t see the folder, 
click More Options to see the traditional Save As dialog box (refer to Figure A-8) 
to select a certain location. Just as you do the first time you save a workbook, you 
choose a storage location for the workbook in the Save As window and then pro-
vide a name for the workbook in the File Name text box.
Opening a workbook
To open an existing workbook, you can either display the contents of the folder 
storing the workbook or open Excel and then choose File  ➪  Open.
If you want to open Excel workbook documents directly from Windows, first dis-
play the folder’s window. When Windows shows the Excel workbook document 
that you want to open in a folder window, simply double-click the workbook. 
Windows starts Excel and tells it to open the workbook.
You can also open workbook documents by choosing File  ➪  Open. When you do, 
Excel first displays the Open window, which you use to identify the storage loca-
tion of the workbook (such as your computer) by clicking the location. After you 
identify the storage location, Excel displays the Open dialog box, as shown in 
­Figure A-9. To use the Open dialog box, select the workbook that you want to open 
from the list Excel displays and then click Open.
FIGURE A-8:  
The Save As 
dialog box.

528      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Printing Excel Workbooks
You print Excel workbooks in roughly the same manner that you print other docu-
ments. First, you start Excel and open the document — in the case of Excel, a 
workbook — that you want to print.
After Excel opens the workbook, choose File  ➪  Print. Excel displays the Print dialog 
box, shown in Figure A-10, which shows you how the printed workbook will look 
and contains buttons and boxes that you use to control printing. Use the Copies box 
to specify how many copies of the workbook you want to print. Select the printer 
you want to use from the Printer drop-down list. Use the Settings buttons and drop-
down lists to specify what part of the workbook you want to print. Then click Print.
If you have a question about one of the buttons or boxes in the Print dialog box, 
click the question mark (?) button, located in the top-right corner of the dialog 
box, and then click the button or box that you don’t understand. A text box offer-
ing context-sensitive help appears.
Often, you’ll have a workbook that looks perfect onscreen (and is), only to realize 
that it was just a little bit too wide to fit on a single sheet of paper. When this hap-
pens, Excel prints two pages for every page that you think you’re printing, thus 
leaving you to reprint — or tape all those sheets together in a haphazard banner. A 
quick preview would save you all this grief (not to mention time, ink, and paper).

One Other Thing to Know
The preceding lists of skills don’t cover every feature or function of Excel. With 
the skills that I’ve just described, however, you can do most of the things that 
people do with Excel.
If you’ve been working with other Windows applications — particularly Microsoft 
Office applications — you can see that none of what you’re going to do with Excel 
is all that complicated. Mostly, it comes down to entering text labels, values, and 
simple formulas into worksheet cells. And although your formulas may become 
very complicated, the mechanics of using Excel to build those formulas aren’t 
particularly difficult.
If you’ve read the preceding paragraphs of this appendix and find yourself scratch-
ing your head, you probably need to find out more about Excel from some other 
resource. You may be able to get the skills that you need simply by experimenting 
with Excel. You may also want to pick up a good tutorial on Excel, such as a recent 
edition of Excel For Dummies, by Greg Harvey (Wiley).

APPENDIX B  Government Web Resources for Businesses      531
Appendix B
Government Web 
Resources for 
Businesses
Many businesspeople think that when it comes to running a business, the 
government is there to get in the way by creating complicated tax codes, requiring 
various licenses, making long lists of things that businesses must and must 
not do, and so on. Well, okay, this is all true. Ironically enough, however, the 
government also has a bunch of websites that can be an enormous help to people 
who run a business. Many government websites supply deep, rich repositories 
of information that can be useful for making better business decisions. This 
appendix, therefore, discusses and describes some of the most useful government 
web resources, including those provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Government Printing Office, and the 
Internal Revenue Service.
Bureau of Economic Analysis
As noted at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) website (www.bea.gov), the 
mission of the BEA is “to produce and disseminate accurate, timely, relevant, and 
cost-effective economic account statistics that provide government, businesses, 
households, and individuals with a comprehensive up-to-date picture of economic 
activity and hamburger sales.” (Okay, I slipped in the part about the hamburgers.) 
Not surprisingly, then, the BEA gives businesspeople lots of information about 
US economic growth, regional economic development, and the nation’s position 
in the world economy. The BEA website (see Figure B-1) provides Internet users 
fast-and-easy access to most of the agency’s publications.

532      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Finding information at the BEA website
Much of the information at the BEA website is available for downloading. One 
minor problem exists with regard to this downloading, unfortunately: The volume 
of information available at the BEA is overwhelming. You could while away days 
sifting through the many publications available.
To explore what’s available, you just need to click various hyperlinks. To see the 
available data related to the U.S. gross domestic product, for example, you click 
the Gross Domestic Product link, which appears (roughly speaking) in the middle 
of the web page.
Downloading a BEA publication
Your web browser may be able to display BEA documents (including PDFs and 
Microsoft Excel workbooks) inside its window, but you can also download a BEA 
publication by following these steps:
1.	 Find and then open the file or publication or workbook that you want to 
download.
FIGURE B-1:  
The Bureau 
of Economic 
Analysis website.

Government Web 
Resources for Businesses
APPENDIX B  Government Web Resources for Businesses      533
Web pages typically include brief descriptions of what publications contain, but 
you may do some head-scratching before you figure out which publications 
are most valuable to you.
2.	 To save the publication file on your local computer, right-click the 
publication and then choose Save As from the shortcut menu.
If right-clicking the publication doesn’t display a shortcut menu with a Save As 
command, look for a File menu and choose Save As. Note that the Windows 10 
Edge web browser doesn’t include a handy Save As command on its File menu, 
so you may want to view some web pages in Internet Explorer or another web 
browser that does include a Save As command on its File menu or an equiva-
lent menu.
3.	 When Windows displays the Save As dialog box (see Figure B-2), choose 
the folder location that you want to use.
You should leave the default contents of the File Name text box alone. This box 
displays the actual name of the publication file.
4.	 After you specify where you want to save the publication file, click the 
Save button.
Uncompressing a BEA publication
Your web browser sometimes downloads a compressed file when you retrieve a 
BEA publication. This means that sometimes before you can actually do anything 
FIGURE B-2:  
The Save As 
dialog box.

534      BOOK 8  Appendixes
with the file, you need to uncompress it. To uncompress a publication file, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Open the folder that holds the publication.
To unzip the compressed publication file, you need to be able to open the file. 
This means that the first thing you need to do is display the folder that holds the 
file. If you’re using the Microsoft Windows operating system, you need to use 
either the My Computer window or the Windows Explorer browser to display 
the contents of the folder where you stored the compressed publication file.
2.	 Right-click the compressed publication folder to open it.
Windows displays a shortcut menu of commands.
3.	 Choose either the Unzip or Extract All command from the shortcut menu.
Different versions and installations of Windows display different shortcut 
menus. One of the commands you see, however, unzips the zipped, or 
compressed, folder. Choose this command.
4.	 Follow the onscreen instructions.
Using a BEA publication
Text portions of the publication often appear in a word-processing document. You 
can easily open this document by using almost any word processor. Tabular data, 
however, is often stored in a spreadsheet file format. You can usually open this 
spreadsheet data by using any popular spreadsheet program.
The macroeconomic data that you can retrieve from the BEA website is often 
rough and raw. Nevertheless, this information can be very interesting to busi-
ness professionals. Being able to view overall growth in your industry over the 
past ten years, for example, gives you a useful backdrop for considering your own 
growth and future growth prospects. Looking at the absolute size of your industry, 
of course, also gives you ideas about how large you can grow. Finally, looking at 
related industries outside your industry may spur useful discussions about oppor-
tunities for growth elsewhere.
Bureau of Labor Statistics
As described in its mission statement, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is 
the “principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, 

Government Web 
Resources for Businesses
APPENDIX B  Government Web Resources for Businesses      535
working conditions, and price changes in the economy. Its mission is to collect, 
analyze, and disseminate essential economic information to support public and 
private decision-making. As an independent statistical agency, BLS serves its 
diverse user communities by providing products and services that are objective, 
timely, accurate, and relevant.”
The BLS website (www.bls.gov), not surprisingly, provides a bucketload of infor-
mation related to labor economics (see Figure B-3).
Finding information at the BLS website
The BLS website contains a ton of useful information for business users. Website 
designs change frequently, so I’m not going to tell you exactly what hyperlinks 
to click to get what, but I will give you a couple of useful tidbits (shark-size bites, 
actually) about the information available here:
»
» The BLS website contains statistics covering several broad topics, including 
inflation and prices, consumer spending and other behavior, unemployment, 
employment, payroll, and worker productivity.
FIGURE B-3:  
The Bureau of 
Labor Statistics 
home page.

536      BOOK 8  Appendixes
»
» The other useful area of the website is its Publications area, which lets you 
view online versions of most BLS publications.
Using BLS information
To view information in a particular area, such as employment and unemploy-
ment, move your mouse pointer across the tabs or menus near the top of the page. 
When you do this, the website displays menus of links that you can click to get to 
the associated portions of the web page. Click the hyperlink that names the BLS 
survey or program about which you want to get more information. If you click or 
point to Subjects and then click the Consumer Price Index link that appears, for 
example, the BLS website displays a list of publications related to Consumer Price 
Index statistics (see Figure B-4).
Some of the publications and documents available on the BLS website are simple 
text files, which you can read in your web browser. Figure B-5 shows one of those 
files.
FIGURE B-4:  
The Consumer 
Price Index page.

Government Web 
Resources for Businesses
APPENDIX B  Government Web Resources for Businesses      537
You can easily import tabular data from text publications into a spreadsheet pro-
gram, such as Excel. To do this, use your web browser to save the web page as a 
text document. Then open the text file by using your spreadsheet program. Excel 
automatically starts an import wizard that asks how the text-file information 
should be arranged into rows and columns of table data.
Many BLS publications are also available as PDF files. The PDF file format pre-
serves the formatting of printed publications. To view and to print PDF docu-
ments, such as the publication shown in Figure B-6, you need a PDF reader, such 
as Adobe Reader (which you can download for free at www.adobe.com/reader).
Assuming that you have a PDF reader, when you click a hyperlink that points to a 
PDF file, your web browser may download the PDF file and then tell your operat-
ing system to open the newly downloaded file in Adobe Reader. To read this docu-
ment using Adobe Reader, simply scroll through the article. To move through the 
pages of a PDF document, you can also click the Previous Page and Next Page but-
tons. (These buttons are the arrow buttons on the toolbar just below the address 
box.) To print the document, click the Print button. To save a copy of the PDF 
document, click the Save button. Reader also provides other tools for navigating a 
PDF document, including zoom tools and even a Find tool for locating text within 
the document.
FIGURE B-5:

538      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Census Bureau
The Census Bureau, as you may know, collects and provides demographic data 
about people and the economy of the United States. The Census Bureau website, at 
www.census.gov, provides links to much of the data that the agency collects and 
disseminates. Figure B-7 shows the U.S. Census Bureau home page.
Finding information at the Census 
Bureau website
The Census Bureau website provides two categories of survey and statistical infor-
mation that are especially interesting to business users: the Population category, 
which you can reach by clicking the Topics tab and then the Population hyperlink on 
the pop-up menu the website displays, and the Economy category, which you reach 
by clicking the Topics tab and then the Economy hyperlink on the pop-up menu.
If you click the Population hyperlink, the Census Bureau website displays the Popu-
lation page (see Figure B-8). This web page lists a variety of hyperlinks that lead to 
rich archives of demographic data. You can click the Migration/Geographic Mobil-
ity link, for example, to see a page that links to surveys, studies, and other reports 
that richly document how citizens and residents move about the United States.

540      BOOK 8  Appendixes
If you click the Economy drop-down menu and then the Economy Main hyper-
link, the Census Bureau website displays the Business & Industry web page (see 
Figure B-9).
The Business & Industry page also displays hyperlinks to numerous areas of inter-
est to business managers and professionals. Your best bet is to simply explore 
these hyperlinks.
Using the Census Bureau’s publications
To read a report, simply click the report’s hyperlink. If you click Topics in the 
main navigation and then select Housing➪  Housing Main, for example, you see 
the Housing Topics web page, which amounts to a table of web pages and down-
loadable documents related to housing.
Many of the documents provided by the Census Bureau website use the PDF file 
format. To print, save, or read a document stored in PDF format, you need PDF 
reader software, such as Adobe Reader, which is available for free at www.adobe.
com/reader.

Using the Census Bureau search engine
The Census Bureau website provides a handy search box (see the top-right corners 
of Figures B-8 and B-9) that lets you search for words and phrases. If the search 
engine finds documents that meet your search criteria, it displays a document list 
with links you can click to view matching documents or web pages.
Using the Census Bureau Subjects index
The Subjects index, available whenever you click the Index A to Z hyperlink in the 
top-right corner, displays an index of all the documents and resources available 
on the Census Bureau website. This useful tool is another way to track down pub-
lications or other resources that provide useful information.
Securities and Exchange Commission
EDGAR  — an acronym for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval 
system — performs automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and 
forwarding of submissions by companies and others that are required by law to 
file forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Its home page 
(see Figure B-10) is on the SEC website at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.
Filing companies and individuals may choose to submit their documents to EDGAR 
by using either plain text or HTML files. Documents submitted in plain text or 
HTML formats are official filings. Many companies also supply PDF versions of 
their documents, just for kicks. (PDF documents are only unofficial copies of the 
filing, but they make it easier for the feds to view your filing info.)
Finding information through EDGAR
EDGAR doesn’t give you access to all publicly filed documents — only those that 
are filed electronically. Companies were phased into EDGAR filing over a three-
year period ending May 6, 1996. Since that date, all public domestic companies 
have been required to use EDGAR to file their quarterly, annual, and other public 
statements.
The Descriptions of SEC Forms hyperlink on the EDGAR home page (refer to 
­Figure  B-10) points to a PDF document that provides descriptions of the most 
common filings made with the SEC. If you have a question about what document 
you want, your best bet is to start with this document.

542      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Searching the EDGAR database
To use EDGAR to look up publicly filed information on a publicly held company, 
first display the EDGAR database by clicking the Search for Company Filings 
hyperlink on the EDGAR home page (refer to Figure B-10). The resulting web page 
(see Figure B-11) doesn’t actually let you begin a search, but it lets you choose 
what type of search you want to perform. You simply click a hyperlink, such as the 
Company or Fund Name link.
Figure B-12 shows the Company Filings search page, which you use to find filing 
documents for a specific public company.
The search form allows you to include Boolean operators in your search argu-
ment. The Boolean operators are AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ. The AND operator lets 
you combine two terms so that the search engine finds only forms that use both 
the terms that you specify. The OR operator lets you join two terms so that the 
search engine finds forms that use one or both words. The NOT operator lets you 
specify that forms using a particular term should be excluded. The ADJ operator 
lets you ensure that your search finds only forms in which one word follows the 
other word; in other words, the second argument you enter is adjacent to the first 
argument.

Federal Reserve
The U.S.  Federal Reserve System website (www.federalreserve.gov) provides 
information about the activities of the Federal Reserve System, called the Fed for 
short (not to be confused with the feds, who like to show up at your door wearing 
unfashionable suits and packing heat). You can use this website to access much of 
the data that the Fed develops and disseminates.
Figure B-13 shows the Federal Reserve System home page. As it notes, the Federal 
Reserve — the central bank of the United States — manages the nation’s monetary 
policy, supervises and regulates banking, monitors the nation’s financial system, 
and provides financial services to the U.S. government and other public agencies.
Finding information at the  
Federal Reserve website
The list of hyperlinks along the top edge of the home page summarizes the infor-
mation available on the Federal Reserve website. Many of these hyperlinks are 
self-explanatory. The Economic Research & Data hyperlink, for example, displays 
a page with links to a list of recent economics statistics releases.

APPENDIX B  Government Web Resources for Businesses      545
Obviously, your interest in the information provided by the website depends on 
what industry you’re in and the responsibilities you have. That said, however, 
much of the macroeconomic information provided on the Federal Reserve website 
is very interesting, especially to anybody involved in the banking industry. The 
following links probably represent the most popular small-business-y links:
»
» The News & Events hyperlink leads to a web page that provides a list of 
hyperlinks to testimony and speeches by people like the chair of the Federal 
Reserve Board, Janet L. Yellen. This page also provides hyperlinks to press 
releases produced by the Federal Reserve.
»
» The Monetary Policy hyperlink leads to the Monetary Policy web page, 
which lists, describes, and provides hyperlinks to Federal Reserve Board 
monetary policy reports, including the Beige Book.
»
» The Banking Information & Regulation hyperlink leads to the Banking 
Information & Regulation web page, which provides hyperlinks to detailed 
information about financial holding companies, large commercial banks, 
minority-owned banks, and so on.
»
» The Economic Research & Data hyperlink leads to the Research & Data web 
page. This page provides a catalog of Federal Reserve Board statistics, surveys, 
reports, staff studies, working papers, and Federal Reserve Board articles — 
information that often isn’t available elsewhere.
Using the Federal Reserve website’s  
information
Many of the reports available for downloading from the Federal Reserve website 
are available as either simple text files or PDF files. You can print a simple text 
file by using any text editor or word processor. A PDF file needs to be printed or 
viewed with PDF reader software, as noted elsewhere in this chapter.
Government Printing Office
One relatively unknown but extremely valuable government resource is the Gov-
ernment Publishing Office (GPO) website (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys), shown 
in Figure B-14.

546      BOOK 8  Appendixes
Information available at the GPO website
The GPO’s FDSYS (which is short for the Federal Digital System) website gives 
you online access to probably every government publication that is actively being 
printed and is available online. This means that you can use the website to get 
publications from any of the other websites discussed in this chapter, as well as 
documents published by other government agencies.
Searching the GPO database
To use the GPO database, enter a word or phrase in the Search Government Pub-
lications box, and click Search. When the GPO search engine finds government 
publications that match your search terms, it lists them on a Search Results web 
page.
You may need to click around a bit to find what you’re looking for, but the GPO 
database is truly mind-boggling in its breadth and depth. Get crazy. Dude. Seri-
ously. Explore this online document treasure.

Internal Revenue Service
I know that you probably get goosebumps just reading this heading, but the web-
site of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS; www.irs.gov), shown in Figure B-15, 
deserves mentioning. Although the website is tailored to consumers, not busi-
nesses, it’s still incredibly useful to anybody in business. From this website, you 
can retrieve printable versions of nearly all IRS publications and forms.
On the home page, click the Forms and Pubs link. The resulting Forms & Publica-
tions page lists numerous links to help you locate the form you need — including 
W-9s (which businesses use to request taxpayer identification numbers), W-4s 
(for new employees), and 941 forms and instructions (for handling quarterly pay-

Note: The IRS provides its forms in about a half dozen file formats, including PDF, 
XML, and SGML. The PDF format is probably the most common format and the 
one you’ll want to use if you have a PDF reader like Adobe Reader. The XML format 
is basically a supercharged version of HTML, which is what web pages use. You 
can also use the SGML text file format if you want to print just the text portion of 
the instructions or forms. SGML format doesn’t provide the nice, clean formatting 
of a form, however — only the text.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Okay, I’m not going to make this an Academy Awards–style speech, but let me 
thank just a few people. First, I want to thank my business school and tax profes-
sors at Central Washington University, the University of Washington, and Golden 
Gate University. Next, thanks to the business clients who’ve given me the honor of 
working with them and teaching me about their businesses and industries. I want 
to thank my colleague Matt Donohoe, who helped me assemble the art for this book. 
Finally, I want to thank all my friends and colleagues at John Wiley & Sons, who
