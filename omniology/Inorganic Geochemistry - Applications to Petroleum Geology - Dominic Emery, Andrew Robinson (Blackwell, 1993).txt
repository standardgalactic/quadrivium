Preface
During the spring of 1990 we were approached by a
colleague, a geologist with a problem. He had read a
paper in the latest issue of a major journal that
presented fluid inclusion data from an area in which
he was exploring. The paper had concluded that a
Tertiary 'thermal event' had been responsible for
generating petroleum; if this were the case, our
friend assured us, it would have far reaching implica-
tions for the prospectivity of the basin. Could we
read the paper and give an opinion as to the validity
of the conclusion? We read the paper. Our view was
that the data were probably fine but that they had
been poorly and over-optimistically interpreted so
that the evidence for a thermal event was very shaky
indeed. Our friend was duly grateful.
It would be tempting to write that at this point we
decided that we could make a lot of money by
writing a book that would explain fluid inclusion
and other geochemical techniques to petroleum
geologists. In fact, we had been planning the project
for a couple of months already but the incident did
serve to confirm our view that there was room for a
book that would enable non-specialists to make up
their own minds about the large number of papers
now appearing in print every month which include
some facet of inorganic geochemistry as a major
constituent. This book is the result. Its purpose is
to bring together the most important inorganic geo-
chemical methods in a single volume, to explain
their potential and limitations in a form that is
accessible to the non-specialist, and to demonstrate
their application to a wide range of problems in
petroleum
geology,
from
exploration,
through
appraisal and development, to production. The
book is therefore
intended for geologists, geo-
physicists and production engineers in oil companies
who wish to broaden their knowledge of the geo-
chemical methods available for solving problems
with which they are routinely faced. We hope that it
will also be of interest to final year undergraduates,
postgraduates with an interest in the inorganic geo-
chemistry of sedimentary rocks and waters, and to
those attending petroleum geology and related MSc
courses.

What is not In this book
1.1 Background
Petroleum is not as easy to find as it used to be. Most
of the accessible sedimentary basins in the world
have been explored and a large proportion of the
more obvious petroleum targets have been drilled.
The more risky and costly exploration becomes, the
more important it is to develop new discoveries
as efficiently as possible and to extract a greater
proportion of the petroleum in place from existing
fields. The last 15 years have seen this imperative
give birth to some important new topics within the
earth sciences, most of which cross the boundaries
between the traditional divisions ofgeology as taught
to undergraduate students. For example, sequence
stratigraphy - now a principal tool of the explora-
tion geologist -
has emerged from classical strati-
graphy and seismic interpretation; and reservoir
description has been born of a long overdue rela-
tionship between reservoir engineering, sophisti-
cated geophysics, stratigraphy and sedimentology.
Inorganic geochemistry is one more relatively new
weapon in the armoury of the petroleum geologist.
In its broadest sense, the subject includes the study
of all of the chemical constituents of rocks and
subsurface
fluids,
excluding
only
organic
com-
ponents based on carbon. This book makes no
attempt to cover this potentially vast field in its en-
tirety. It may appear at first glance to contain rather
a mixed bag of subject matter but the choice of what
to include has not been arbitrary. The themes of
the book are the characterization of fluids in sedi-
mentary basins, understanding their interaction with
each other and with rocks and the application of this
information to finding, developing and producing oil
and gas. This might include dating quartz cement
growth in a sandstone in an attempt to predict
porosity distribution, or determining the extent of
seawater breakthrough into a reservoir during pro-
duction. There is a considerable degree of over-
lap with the field of sediment diagenesis but this
book covers important topics with a geochemical
component which would never find their way into
a diagenesis book, such as strontium isotope strati-
graphy, correlation and production chemistry.

2 Chapter 1
The subject of inorganic geochemistry is not of
course in itself new, but its application to sedi-
mentary basins
has
lagged behind igneous
and
metamorphic geochemistry. There are a number
of reasons for this.
One may be the relatively
unglamorous nature of a sandstone when set beside
a peridotite. Perhaps more important is the fact that
sedimentary, particularly clastic rocks are inherently
difficult to analyse in any meaningful way because
they contain constituents with many different origins
which for most purposes must be analysed separ-
ately. The study of sediment geochemistry has
however been stimulated in recent years by the
increased availability of core from deeply buried
sediments taken by petroleum exploration com-
panies and by their readiness to finance research
into controls on porosity and permeability (we are
ourselves beneficiaries of this largess). The last
few years have also seen the development of new
methods - the use of lasers, for example
which
have helped to overcome sampling problems.
1.2 How is inorganic geochemistry applied
to petroleum geology?
It is relatively easy to watch wave ripples form or to
snorkel over a growing reef and study the deposition
of sediments. It is a lot harder to study how sedi-
ments are modified during burial in a basin; pro-
cesses cannot in the main be directly observed
because they occur at substantial depths and in
many cases may well have ended long ago. Only
the products of fluid-rock interaction. diagenetic
minerals and present day formation waters, are left
to act as records. Inorganic geochemistry provides a
means of interpreting these records. The main types
of information it provides are as follows.
1 Timing. Relative and absolute ages of mineral
growth and dissolution, and of the presence and
migration of fluids (both water and petroleum).
2 Temperature.
Temperatures at which minerals
grew or dissolved and at which particular fluids were
present in a rock's pores. Temperature and timing
are correlated for a sediment in a subsiding sedi-
mentary basin and can be related by modelling
burial and thermal history.
3 Chemical composition.
The
bulk and
isotope
chemistries of minerals and water contain informa-
tion about the history of fluids, especially their
interaction with rocks.
It is one matter to obtain this information from
minerals and fluids but another matter entirely to
interpret the processes involved. Given a sample
of quartz cemented sandstone, the geochemist will
quite probably be able to find out what temperature
it grew at and say something about the origin of the
water involved, but will not be able to say why the
rock is cemented or what caused the quartz to
precipitate. This is the level of current understand-
ing of most diagenetic phenomena: we can charac-
terize them but not explain them. The trick to using
inorganic geochemistry to solve problems in the field
of petroleum geology is to accept these limitations
and do the best possible with the information that
can be obtained. In many cases, this is quite a lot.
At the very least, geochemical methods provide a
means of integrating diagenetic phenomena into
the temporal framework that forms the basis of
basin analysis. For example, the timing of mineral
cementation
and
dissolution,
and
consequent
changes in porosity and permeability can be related
to phases in the development of a basin and to oil
migration. The models that emerge for porosity
and permeability prediction invariably involve a
large empirical component, but they represent an
improvement over empiricism alone.
1.3 What is in this book
This book has two parts. Chapters 2-5 describe the
groups of techniques that we have found to be most
useful
in petroleum geology and Chapters 6-9
describe case histories - mostly from our own work
or that of our colleagues - grouped according to the
nature of the problem that inorganic geochemistry
helped (or in some cases, failed) to solve.
The chapters on geochemical techniques empha-
size applications to sedimentary rocks and the fluids
in sedimentary basins. Particular attention is paid to
precision and accuracy and to the questions of what
information can be plausibly obtained and under
what circumstances: what do data mean and what do
they not mean? Particular difficulties and pitfalls are
illustrated by the use of examples which are made up
of complete sets of real data. The case histories
that make up the second half of the book cover a
wide range of applications but inevitably reflect
our interests and biases. They include clastic and
carbonate rocks from many parts of the world but a
number are from the North Sea (Fig. 1.1). Many of
Fig. 1.1 (Opposite page.) Location of North Sea oil and
gas fields mentioned in this book.

the case studies are from rift basins but there is
usually no reason why analogous problems in other
geological settings should not be tackled in similar
ways. Coarse grained sediments figure more than
mudstones
because
they
are
of importance
as
reservoir rocks and because, in the main, they
are easier to study and more information can be
obtained from them.
All of the case histories are taken from real life
and we have not tinkered with the data or modified
the conclusions. Some were successful in solving the
problem they set out to solve, rather more solved it
partially, some solved a completely different prob-
lem and others proved scientifically fascinating but
of no use whatsoever. We feel that it is far more
instructive,
and
interesting,
to
present
relative
failures alongside relative successes. Negative results
rarely get published but are often as instructive
as positive outcomes. In most cases, careful and
circumspect science can take a problem only so far.
When that point is reached - and we try to make it
clear when it is -
we do not feel embarrassed to
speculate. Petroleum geology, particularly explora-
tion, involves making the best of incomplete under-
standing and is an essentially optimistic enterprise.
1.4 Overview
Chapter 2 (Textural and Mineralogical Analysis)
describes five basic and three more advanced tech-
niques for mineral identification and quantification.
Inclusion of this topic in a book on geochemistry
stretches the definition of the term, but analysis of a
sample's mineralogy is vital if any sense is to be
made of geochemical information obtained from
it. The basic techniques include thin-section petro-
graphy, cathodoluminescence microscopy, fluores-
cence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy
and X-ray diffraction. Examples are given through-
out the text of the application of the techniques
to mineral identification, differentiation of detrital
grains from diagenetic cements, mineral quantifica-
tion and the construction of paragenetic histories for
reservoir rocks. The three more advanced techniques
covered
are
transmission
electron
microscopy,
thermogravimetric-evolved water analysis and pore
image analysis, which are playing an increasing role
in chemical analysis, clay mineral quantification and
porosity analysis respectively. The chapter stresses
the application of techniques at the expense of
a detailed description of apparatus and sample pre-
paration (for which see Tucker, 1988). Emphasis
is also placed on the value of combining the tech-
niques with standard petrophysical and engineering
methods for describing the reservoir quality of rock
samples.
Chapter 3 (Fluid Inclusions) explains how the
study of these minute samples of fluid trapped dur-
ing mineral growth or fracture healing can provide
information about the temperatures of diagenetic
reactions, and about the composition of fluids pass-
ing through sedimentary rocks and at what temper-
atures they did so. The study of fluid inclusions in
igneous rocks and particularly, metallic mineral
deposits, goes back more than a century but only
over the last 10 years has much effort been put into
the study of inclusions in sediments. Much of the
earlier work, and some current studies, suffer from
overinterpretation
and this chapter attempts to
redress the balance by underlining some limitations
of the technique. Particular attention is paid to
the question of leakage because if fluid inclusions in
diagenetic minerals routinely leak - and a case can
be made for thinking that they do - then they will
be of limited value for the study of sedimentary
rocks.
The applications of stable isotopes, the subject of
Chapter 4, to petroleum geological problems range
from stratigraphic analysis to better understanding
and predicting reservoir quality and reservoir fluid
type. Stable isotopes are used principally as natural
tracers for subsurface reactions and -
in the case
of oxygen isotopes - can provide information about
reaction temperature. The chapter first describes
the principles and nomenclature of stable isotope
systems (a necessary evil but surprisingly painless),
the basic analytical techniques, and the uncertainties
associated
with
isotopic measurements.
This
is
followed by a description of the most important
stable isotope systems in the context of the fluids
and minerals in which they are found: oxygen in
water, silicate, sulphate and carbonate minerals;
hydrogen in water and clays; carbon in carbonate
minerals, CO2 and CH4 ; and sulphur in sulphate and
sulphide minerals and HzS.
Chapter 5 explains the use of radiogenic isotopes
to unravel geological
history. It begins with a
refresher in the simple physics that forms the basis
of radiometric dating, which serves to stress the
common features of all of the dating methods. Four
isotope
systems
are
described:
K-Ar,
Rb-Sr,
Sm-Nd and U-Th-Pb. K-Ar dating is almost
routinely used to date K-bearing mineral cements,
principally illite. The chapter explains why this must

be done with great care even when the sample
material is particularly suitable. Ar-Ar dating
a
clever technique that also relies on the K-Ar decay
series - is also covered. The other isotope systems
can be used for dating sedimentary material only
under rather restricted circumstances. However,
radiogenic isotopes also
have
value
as
natural
tracers. Strontium isotope ratios in particular can be
used to trace the chemical evolution of natural
waters. One consequence of this property is their
use as a tool for dating marine carbonate and phos-
phate (strontium isotope stratigraphy).
Chapter 6 (Porosity and Permeability Prediction)
is the first of four chapters that group case histories
to illustrate a particular application of inorganic
geochemistry. It is also the bulkiest because it has
been up to now the most important application if the
number of published studies is anything to go by.
The introductory section explains how inorganic
geochemistry contributes to porosity and perme-
ability prediction
by reducing risk (neither can
be predicted using inorganic geochemistry alone).
There follow six case histories which range from
exploration in frontier areas where the amount of
information available is very limited (Flemish Pass,
Grand Banks) through progressively more mature
exploration areas (offshore Louisiana and the Brent
Province) to porosity prediction in appraisal, devel-
opment and production in three North Sea fields
(Magnus, Machar and Forties).
Chapter 7 (Fluid Migration) considers inorganic
geochemical evidence for phases of water and petro-
leum migration. The value of knowing about petro-
leum migration need hardly be underlined but
migration of waters is also of interest as these affect
reservoir quality by interacting with rocks and can
also alter oil through the processes of biodegrada-
tion and water washing. The four case histories
cover the use of fluid inclusions for sorting out
migration history in poorly and better known areas
(Aquitaine and Weald Basins), the prediction of
the occurrence of a rather odd diagenetic reservoir
rock in the Central North Sea and the history of
filling of a gas-condensate discovery (Waalwijk,
Netherlands).
The next chapter (Correlation) describes how
stable and radiogenic isotope systems can be used
to correlate stratigraphic units, chiefly on a broad
exploration scale, but also on the smaller scale of
individual reservoir units within discrete oilfields.
Four case studies are described. The first, from the
Norwegian North Sea, shows how strontium isotope
Introduction 5
stratigraphy and radiometric dating can be used
to refine the stratigraphic correlation of Tertiary
clastic sediments, and assist in erecting a sequence
stratigraphy. The second also uses isotope strati-
graphy, but in this case oxygen isotopes are applied
to provide a very high resolution stratigraphy of a
few tens of thousands of years for Plio-Pleistocene
sandstone reservoir targets in the Gulf of Mexico.
The third and fourth case studies are both from oil-
fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, the
Ekofisk Chalk Field, and the clastic Gullfaks Field.
In Ekofisk, strontium isotopes are used to correlate
reservoir zones using data obtained from the rock
matrix and from the formation waters. In Gullfaks,
samarium and neodymium isotopic methods are
used to predict the distribution of reservoir sand
bodies by identifying changes in sand provenance.
Chapter 9 (Petroleum Recovery) outlines the
basic principles of secondary and enhanced oil
recovery, and the problems of corrosive fluid pro-
duction (HzS and COz). The first two case studies,
from the Forties Field, UK North Sea, and from the
Wytch Farm Field, onshore UK, demonstrate the
value of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes as tracers for
seawater breakthrough during oil production. The
application of sulphur isotopes for understanding
sour gas production in Wytch Farm is also outlined.
The last two case studies are from the Cretaceous
heavy oil sands of Alberta and Saskatchewan in
western Canada. These demonstrate the importance
of quantitative petrography linked to petrophysics
for describing the effects of thermal recovery pro-
cesses (steam injection and fireflooding) on shallow
reservoir sandstones. The case study on steam injec-
tion also shows how carbon isotopes can be used to
identify the source of COz produced during thermal
recovery.
1.5 What is not in this book
This is a book about the application of fluid-fluid
and fluid-rock interaction to petroleum geology and
as such contains only those methods which we have
found to be useful in this field. We avoid describing
methods of analysing whole rocks partly because we
have found bulk chemistry to be of rather limited
value in this respect and also because it is a subject
in its own right that has been better covered than we
could manage in other books. We have also avoided
chemical modelling of water-rock interaction and
modelling of fluid flow in sedimentary basins. These
are used together by some (not by us) to predict

6 Chapter 1
porosity; we believe them to have explanatory
power and to be useful for understanding diagenetic
processes but feel that their predictive power is
limited
(see
Section
6.1).
Although
geohistory
analysis - especially burial and thermal modelling -
is repeatedly referred to in the text, it also con-
stitutes a separate subject and we have not as a
consequence dealt with fission track analysis which
is principally a means of calibrating burial history.

2.1 Introduction
Mineralogical and textural analysis of samples is the
essential first step in any inorganic geochemical
programme and provides the critical link between
the quality of a reservoir - chiefly its porosity and
permeability -
and more advanced geochemical
techniques such as fluid inclusion analysis (Fig. 2.1).
Mineralogical and textural analysis can provide
several types of information:
1 mineral identification;
2 differentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases;
3 quantitative analysis of mineral abundance;
4 mineral paragenesis (the sequence of mineral
growth and dissolution);
5 mineral chemistry;
6 description and quantification of porosity; and
7 identification of the
main
factors
influencing
porosity and permeability.
The most appropriate technique for providing each
of these is shown in Table 2.1. Note that, to be most
effective, certain techniques need to be applied in
conjunction with others. Clay mineral X-ray diffrac-
tion is most effective as a tool for quantifying clay
mineral content in rock samples when applied
with
thermogravimetric-evolved
water
analysis.
Similarly, cathodoluminescence microscopy of lime-
stone samples is most effective when applied with
observations made using transmitted light.
The objectives of this chapter are to introduce
mineralogical and textural analytical techniques, and
their applications to understanding the post-deposi-
tional evolution of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks
in petroleum provinces. We will concentrate parti-
cularly on the application of the variety of techniques
described here, rather than on details of instrumen-
tation and sample preparation. References covering
these aspects in more depth are given in the text.

there are many texts which cover all aspects of
sedimentary petrology. Folk (1974), Pettijohn (1975)
and Tucker (1981) are good general petrographic
texts, whereas Moore (1989) and Pettijohn et al.
(1973) concentrate on carbonate and siliciclastic
petrography respectively. The Atlas of Sedimentary
Rocks by Adams et al. (1984), and the AAPG colour
guides to sandstones (Scholle, 1979) and carbonates
(Scholle, 1978) contain superb colour thin-section
photomicrographs and are well worth referring to.
The objective of this section is to explain how
transmitted light petrography can be used to describe
the diagenesis of sedimentary rocks (rather than the
depositional fabric). Petrographic description can
provide five main pieces of information:
1 mineral identification;
2 differentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases;
3 quantitative analysis of mineral abundance;
4 mineral paragenesis; and
5 description of porosity.
The problems associated with siliciclastic petro-
graphy are quite different from those associated
with carbonates. Siliciclastic rocks tend to be poly-
mineralic, with several different diagenetic phases
such as clay minerals, quartz and carbonates and it is
usually easy to distinguish these from the detrital
components of the sediment. In contrast, carbonate
rocks are composed of fewer minerals which tend
to be relatively unstable during diagenesis so that
much of the primary depositional fabric may be
obliterated. Recognition of subtle changes in car-
bonate fabric and chemistry is therefore essential to
differentiate primary constituents from diagenetic
phases, and to allow different diagenetic carbonates
to be recognized.
2.2.2 Sample preparation
The thin-section is the basic sample requirement for
microscope petrography. It consists of a rock wafer
30 11m thick, mounted on a glass slide. The thickness
of the rock wafer is standard to ensure uniformity
of birefringence colours (which are determined in
part by sample thickness). Similarly, to ensure com-
parability of samples, the rock wafer is usually
mounted on the slide in a medium of uniform refrac-
tive index. Basic thin-section preparation is de-
scribed in more detail by Miller (1988).
Before the section is cut, samples are commonly
impregnated with a dyed resin. This fills and colours
porespace in the sample, allowing easier identifi-
cation of porosity types in the sample, and also

Thin-sections are usually stained. Two stains are
commonly used: a mixed stain for carbonates allow-
ing the differentiation of ferroan and non-ferroan
calcites and dolomites (Dickson, 1966); and a stain
for feldspars allowing the differentiation ofpotassium
feldspars, plagioclase and quartz (Houghton, 1980).
Table 2.2 summarizes the effects of the staining
procedures on carbonate and silicate mineralogies.
Note that it is essential to apply the feldspar stain
before the carbonate stain, otherwise the latter will
be removed!

2.2.3 Mineral identification and differentiation of
detrital grains from diagenetic cements
The main theme of this section is the differentiation
of diagenetic phases from depositional grains, which
can be a source of considerable ambiguity in thin-
section description. The following provides a guide
to the recognition of the most common diagenetic
phases in siliciclastic and carbonate rocks, and out-
lines the pitfalls and problems of distinguishing
detrital grains and matrix from diagenetic phases. A
detailed description of sedimentary mineral iden-

tification is beyond the scope of this book. The
reader is referred to texts by Kerr (1959) and Deer
et al. (1977). Table 2.3 summarizes the optical prop-
erties of common minerals in sedimentary.rocks and
their occurrence. If the nature of a mineral is in
doubt from
microscopy alone, microbeam tech-
niques can be applied (see subsequent sections in
this chapter).
Quartz cement
Quartz cement is the most common diagenetic sili-
cate mineral in sandstones (McBride, 1989). It occurs
chiefly in two forms: as microcrystalline cement and
as syntaxial overgrowths on detrital quartz grains
(Table 2.3). Microcrystalline quartz, also known as
microquartz, chert or chalcedony, is relatively easy
to differentiate from the depositional fabric of the
rock (Fig. 2.2a). Syntaxial quartz overgrowths are
the most common form of quartz cement but are
often difficult to distinguish from detrital grains
because of the optical continuity of quartz across the
grain-cement boundary. Quartz overgrowths can
be clearly differentiated using optical microscopy
only if the grain-cement boundary is visible. Figure
2.2b shows a sandstone largely composed of quartz
in which grain margins cannot be identified even
though the euhedral crystal faces show that quartz
Feldspars
Feldspar cements are relatively common in arkosic
sandstones but usually form only a minor or trace
component of the total rock volume (Waugh, 1978).
Like quartz, feldspar cements chiefly occur as syn-
taxial overgrowths on detrital grains and so present
the same problems of identification. However, there
is a further complication in feldspar petrography:
certain types of feldspar, whether grains or cement,
cannot be distinguished from each other or, in some
cases, from quartz unless the section is stained (see
Section 2.2.2).
Three types of feldspar are usually distinguished
in sedimentary petrography: plagioclase, orthoclase
and microcline (Table 2.3). Plagioclase is easily
identified by common multiple or lamellar twinning
which gives the mineral its characteristic striped
appearance under crossed polars (Fig. 2.2d; Deer
et al., 1977). Microcline, the low-temperature form
of potassium feldspar, is also easy to identify owing
to its cross-hatched 'tartan' twinning visible under
crossed polars. Other feldspars are frequently un-
twinned. A common feature of feldspars, which also
assists in their identification, is their diagenetic
instability relative to quartz (Burley et al., 1985).
Feldspars dissolve more readily, leaving ragged,
etched grain remnants in oversized secondary pores,
or
skeletal
grains
with
microporosity
(Schmidt
& McDonald, 1979). As well as being leached,
feldspars are commonly altered to fine-grained clay
minerals.
cement is present. If quartz cementation had con-
tinued to fill porespaces completely, only sutured
contacts between areas of quartz would be visible.
One
possible interpretation
would
be that
the
sutured contacts could represent compromise bound-
aries between growing quartz crystals. Alternatively,
we could infer that there is no quartz cement, and
that the sutured boundaries are pressure-solution
contacts along which quartz cement has been dis-
solved
rather
than
precipitated
(Houseknecht,
1988). Distinction between these two quite different
interpretations must involve recourse to further
techniques such as cathodoluminescence microscopy
(Section 2.3). Fortunately, many sandstones have
a thin coating of depositional or diagenetic mater-
ial, commonly haematite, between the grains and
cement which allows grain outlines to be identified
(Fig. 2.2c). Fluid inclusions are also often con-
centrated
along
grain-cement
boundaries

Clay minerals
Clay minerals are best observed in the scanning
electron microscope because of their small size
(usually a few to a few tens of micrometres). Never-
theless, optical microscopy can still provide useful
general information on certain clay mineral types.
There are two main problems to be aware of in clay
mineral identification from thin-section petrography:
the identification of clay mineral type and dif-
ferentiation of clay mineral cements from matrix
clay.
The common diagenetic clay minerals are sum-
marized in Table 2.3. Kaolinite forms characteristic
booklets (Fig. 2.3a, b) or vermiform aggregates
with low birefringence (Fig.
2.3c).
Chlorite, a
ferromagnesian clay mineral, is also relatively easy
to identify on account of its green hue in transmitted
light
and
anomalous steely blue
birefringence.
It
usually forms characteristic pseudohexagonal
platelets or a complex meshwork. Illite, a potassium-
bearing clay, commonly forms plates parallel to
grain surfaces, or micrometre-thick fibres extend-

ing away from the grain surface, and can also be
identified from its relatively high birefringence. Pure
smectite is less common as a cement in sandstones,
but interstratified illite/smectites may form fibrous
cements. These can be distinguished from pure illites
using X-ray diffraction (Section 2.7). Glauconite is
relatively easy to identify owing to its green hue in
thin-section and its common occurrence as pellets
in marine sandstones. Differentiating detrital from
diagenetic clay may be more difficult. Frequently,
what is described as a clay matrix consists of a dense
brown mess which may contain any combination of
original detrital material, recrystallized detrital clay,
or true diagenetic precipitate. Under such circum-
stances, clay mineral identification
is better left
to

(Section
2.5),
transmission electron microscopy (Section 2.6) and
X-ray diffraction.

rocks is relatively straightforward and may be as-

samples are unstained, differentiation of carbonate
cements from one another can be difficult and
relies chiefly on cement fabric criteria which are
much more subjective (Table 2.4; Harwood, 1988).
Replacive and cementing dolomite commonly form
euhedral rhombic crystals (Fig. 2.3d) or coarse crys-
tals ofbaroque or saddle dolomite, showing undulose
extinction. Calcite may display a wide variety of
morphologies,
from

less correctly,
fibrous) through to poikilotopic, where coarse crys-
tals of uniform extinction enclose detrital grains and
earlier cement generations.
In carbonate rocks, the major problems are in
djstinguishing unaltered carbonate grains from those
which have been diagenetically modified, and in
differentiating genuine cements from neomorphic
carbonate. Again, staining the thin-section helps.
Under normal marine conditions, all organisms
secreting a calcite test will precipitate non-ferroan
calcite with a low manganese content. Accordingly,
the presence of any dolomite or ferroan calcite
immediately indicates that the skeletal
particle
has undergone diagenetic alteration. However, the
presence of non-ferroan calcite in itself is insufficient
evidence to guarantee that no diagenetic alteration
has taken place. Further screening for the presence
of manganese in the calcite by cathodoluminescence
(Section 2.3) should be carried out, as well as detailed
observation of skeletal fabrics by scanning electron
microscopy (Section 2.5).
Carbonate cements in carbonate rocks display

16 Chapter 2
a wide variety of fabrics, many independent of
mineralogy. It is often hard to distinguish pore-
filling cement from neomorphic carbonate (usually
calcite). Neomorphism refers to the transformation
between one mineral and itself or a polymorph. In
the case of calcite, this would be the transformation
of aragonite to calcite and the transformation of
calcite to calcite, believed to proceed via a thin
solution film mechanism, dissolving a carbonate in
front and precipitating calcite behind. For further
discussion of carbonate neomorphism, the reader is
referred to Tucker (1981) and Bathurst (1975). This
process is quite different from direct precipitation
of cement and, importantly, the isotopic and fluid
inclusion compositions of neomorphic calcite are
less likely to give any easily interpretable informa-
tion about diagenetic environment. It is therefore
necessary to distinguish neomorphic and cementing
calcite prior to further geochemical analysis. Neo-
morphic calcites usually show irregular, curved or
diffuse intercrystalline boundaries, irregular crystal
size distributions and the presence of skeletal grains
floating in coarse spar. Where skeletal grains have
been neomorphosed, relics of internal structure of
the shell may be preserved. The neomorphic spar
may display a brownish hue and may be composed
of an irregular mosaic of small and large calcite
crystals with wavy, curved or straight intercrystalline
boundaries. Cathodoluminescence is also a valuable
tool
in
distinguishing
neomorphic
calcite
from
cement (Section 2.3; Dickson, 1983).
Evaporites
Several evaporite minerals, including halite and the
sulphates gypsum, anhydrite, celestite and barite
can occur as diagenetic phases in both siliciclastic
and carbonate rocks. They are usually relatively
easy to distinguish as a group from other minerals
by their optical properties (Table 2.3). Halite, in
particular, is the only common colourless cubic (and
therefore isotropic) mineral found in sedimentary
rocks. It is worth pointing out, however, that it
is frequently missed by petrography because it dis-
solves during the standard preparation of thin-
sections. If halite is expected, samples should be
prepared in oil.
The most significant petrographic problem with
the sulphate minerals is distinguishing one from
another. Anhydrite can usually be recognized from
its bright birefringence colours. Distinction between
celestite and barite is often difficult. Where in doubt,
X-ray diffraction (Section 2.7) or energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis in the SEM should be used (Section
2.5).
Iron oxides and pyrite
In sedimentary rocks, these opaque minerals are
usually diagenetic in origin and may precipitate in
both carbonates and clastics. Pyrite in particular is a
common phase. Distinction between pyrite and the
common iron oxides, haematite and magnetite is
best achieved by reflected light microscopy (Table
2.3).
2.2.4 Mineralogical quantification
Point-counting is still the most widely used method
for obtaining a quantitative analysis of sedimentary
rock mineralogy (Oalehouse, 1971a). The apparatus
is very simple, consisting of a movable microscope
stage on which the sample is mounted, connected to
a multi-channel recorder. Each channel corresponds
to a particular mineral or porosity type the operator
has chosen to differentiate. Points correspond to a
mineral or porosity type falling beneath the cross-
hairs of the microscope. Each time the operator
records a mineral or porosity type on a channel,
the stage jumps forward a set distance which will
normally correspond to the mean grain size of the
sample. The operator can also specify the number
of points to be recorded; clearly the greater the
number of points, the more accurate the point-count
analysis is likely to be. Table 2.5 illustrates a typ-
ical point-count record from a sandstone sample.
Detrital and diagenetic minerals have been dif-
ferentiated, and visible porosity has been recorded.
The record comprises 400 points, recalculated as
percentages.
Point-counting
has
numerous drawbacks
and
pitfalls. Its major drawback is that a lot of counts
need to be obtained to get adequate precision (Fig.
2.4). Using our point-count analysis from Table 2.5,
we can assign confidence limits to our mineral or
porosity percentages, depending on the number
of points counted and the estimated percentages.
Quartz grain content (00) which comprises 63% of
the sample according to our analysis should really be
expressed as 63 ± 5%
(95%
confidence limits);
± 5% is acceptable for a major phase such as quartz.
However, calcite cement (CC), comprising only 4%
of the point-count has 95% confidence limits of
± 2%, an uncertainty of 50%. The problems of
precision in point-counting can be overcome by
very large numbers of counts, but this can be very

tedious. To date, no single system has been devel-
oped which can provide an automated point-count,
because none can provide all
the
information
required for a detailed petrographic analysis, par-
ticularly mineral identification and differentiation of
detrital from diagenetic mineralogies.
Identification of minerals during point-counting
can be an additional problem depending on the
preparation of the sample and experience of the
operator. It might be difficult to subdivide dif-
ferent feldspar types on a point-count record if the
thin-section had not been stained for feldspar. The
point-count record should be designed according
to the information that an operator believes he or
she can reasonably get from a sample, depending
on sample preparation and the experience of the
operator.
2.2.5 Mineral paragenesis
Mineral paragenesis is the order in which diagenetic
mineral phases grow. A full paragenetic description
also includes information on mineral dissolution as
well as precipitation and the timing of these events
relative to phases of compaction, fracturing and, in
petroleum reservoirs, petroleum filling. Unravelling
a paragenetic history is an essential prerequisite to
any further geochemical analysis as it provides a
framework of the relative timing of mineral pre-
cipitation into which quantitative information can be
inserted. The example shown in Fig. 2.5 was derived
from several hundred thin-section analyses and was
constructed by following a few simple guidelines.
Firstly, the box or bar corresponding to a diagenetic
episode is of uniform length because petrography
alone provides no information about its duration.
Although a greater volume' of mineral type may
intuitively suggest a greater length of time for pre-
cipitation, this need not necessarily be the case.
Secondly, boxes representing diagenetic episodes
overlap where there is ambiguity about the relative
timing of diagenetic episodes. This may be due to
the relatively low resolution of the petrographic
microscope (in which case techniques capable of
higher resolution may prove useful), may actually
reflect the co-precipitation of different diagenetic
phases, or may be due to an intrinsic ambiguity in
the textural criterion employed. Only where there is
unequivocal evidence of one phase consistently
post-dating another
should
boxes not
overlap.

Diagenetic phases are listed down the left-hand
column of the paragenetic history approximately
in order of occurrence. In the case of Magnus, some
precipitated more than once. It may be necessary
to
construct
separate
paragenetic sequences
to
represent
differences
in
diagenesis
in
different
portions of a petroleum reservoir, for example in
the zone of petroleum accumulation and in the
underlying aquifer. Similarly, oilfields containing
reservoirs deposited in different sedimentary en-
vironments
should
be
represented
on
separate
paragenetic history diagrams because the depo-
sitional environment may exert an influence on the
nature of the diagenetic product (Burley et al.,
1985). An extreme example of this would be an
oilfield
with
stacked
sandstone
and
limestone
reservoirs.
Several authors (Burley et al., 1985; Harwood,
1988) have suggested that 'diagenetic environment'
can be added to paragenetic sequences and have
followed the scheme of Table 2.6 (Choquette &
Pray, 1970). We feel that this classification can easily
obscure more than it enlightens and would prefer to
see it dropped in favour of simple textural terms
to describe paragenesis, such as 'post-compaction'.
Further information about diagenetic setting and
absolute ages for diagenetic precipitates can be
obtained by the application of geochemical tech-
niques. Petrography is an excellent first-pass tool for
paragenetic information, but its limitations should
be fully appreciated.

significance as a reservoir parameter because it deter-
mines the storage capacity* of a petroleum field,
referred to as oit-in-placet . Throughout much of this
book, we will be referring to geochemical methods
of porosity prediction and we even devote a chapter
to case studies (Chapter 6). Porosity is usually
measured by downhole wireline log techniques or by
core analysis. Pore image analysis (Section 2.9)
is a sophisticated computer-based technique which
can determine porosity from thin-sections, as well as
statistically analyse pore shapes and pore size dis-
tributions. However, these techniques provide no
information about the origin of porosity; this is the
business of petrographic porosity description.
Porosity within a sediment may be primary, the
voids remaining after deposition of the sand or
carbonate has taken place, or secondary, resulting
from dissolution of grains and/or cement, shrinkage
of the sediment, or fracturing of lithified or partly
lithified rock
in the
subsurface~. Most primary
porosity consists of the space remaining between the
original components of the sediment (intergranular),
although some grains, for example gastropods or
foraminifera, may retain primary pores within them
(intragranular).
Secondary porosity may also be
intergranuJar
and
intragranular.
Intergranular
secondary porosity is commonly observed in sand-

stones as oversized pores, so caned because the
remaining porespace is too large to be a primary
pore (compare the mean primary intergranular pore
sizes with the secondary pore in Fig. 2.6a). Over-
sized pores are interpreted to have originated from
the dissolution of unstable grains such as lithic frag-
ments or feldspars. In carbonates, secondary intra-
particle porosity is very common, reflecting the
mineralogical instability of carbonates, especially
aragonite, under diagenetic conditions. A specific
type of secondary intergranular porosity is the
mouldic pore where clear evidence of whole or
partial
dissolution
of
skeletal
(biomouldic)
or
other carbonate grains has taken place (Fig. 2.6b;
Choquette & Pray, 1970). Intercrystalline porosity is
commonly found in recrystallized carbonates, par-
ticularly dolomite. So-called 'oilman's dream' is
actually sucrosic dolomite containing well-connected
intercrystalline secondary porosity. Intercrystalline
porosity may be found between authigenic clay
fibres, but is usually too small to be resolved by
conventional microscopy. Where individual pores
cannot be resolved using standard petrographic
methods, the term microporosity can be applied.
This usually appears in thin-section as an area which
has taken up some of the impregnating resin. Scan-
ning electron microscopy is the most suitable tool
for examining microporosity, which may be of pri-
mary or secondary origin. Other porosity types
which cut across the original rock fabric and are all
secondary in origin include fracture pores (which
rarely contribute a large proportion of the total
porosity, but may greatly assist the flow of petro-
leum), and vuggy and cavernous porosities which
may be found in carbonate sediments which have
experienced extensive leaching and karstification.
Cavernous porosities (defined as man-sized pores)
are for example common in karstified Tertiary lime-
stone reservoirs of the Far East and present major
drilling problems, such as dropped drill bits and
massive drilling mud losses (Rudolph & Lehmann,
1989).
* The storage capacity of the rock is the amount of petro-
leum the rock can potentially hold per unit volume.
t Oil-in-place (OIP, or gas-in-place, GIP) is the amount of
oil actually in the reservoir. OIP does not correspond to
the reserves figure, which is the amount of recoverable oil
in a field.
:j: The terms used in petrographic porosity description are
based largely on two papers: Choquette and Pray (1970)
and Schmidt et al. (1977).

The reader will occasionally come across the term
minus-cement porosity. This is (as its name suggests)
not actually present-day porespace at all, but an
estimate of porosity prior to cementation. Minus-
cement porosity can be estimated for specific cement
phases, such as minus-calcite porosity in a calcite-
cemented sandstone nodule, or the quartz-cemented
sandstone illustrated in Fig. 2.2c. The value of
estimating minus-cement porosities is that they can
provide general information on the burial depth
at which cementation took place, assuming that
the only change the sediment underwent before
cementation
was
mechanical
compaction.
The
minus-cement porosity can then be estimated from
point-counting a cement phase, and the resulting
porosity estimate can then be compared to known
compaction curves which relate porosity to burial
depth in normally pressured systems* (Robinson &
Gluyas, 1991b). This approach is only really valid
for moderately well sorted sandstones which show
little or no evidence of diagenetic alteration prior
to or during mechanical compaction. Carbonates,
which display abundant diagenetic alteration, are
wholly unsuitable for this type of analysis.
*A normally pressured system is one in which the down-
hole increase in pressure is purely hydrostatic, with a
continuous, connected water column through the pores of
the buried sediment to the sea bed.
2.3 Cathodoluminescence microscopy
2.3.1 Introduction
Cathodoluminescence (CL) is the visible light emit-
ted by the surface of a mineral when bombarded
with electrons in a vacuum. The earliest geological
use of CL was made by Long and Agrell (1965)
and Sippel (1968). Since that time, commercial
luminoscopes
and
luminescence
detectors
have
become available and CL is now a standard tech-
nique in the petrographic description of a rock
sample. The origin of CL is poorly understood.
Recent detailed work on carbonates has demon-
strated a link between the presence of certain cations
substituting for Ca and Mg in the lattice of common
carbonate minerals, and activation or quenching of
luminescencet (Reeder, 1986; Mason, 1987; Walker
et al., 1989). Manganese is the best studied activator
of luminescence, whereas iron is the most common
quencher.
The
relative concentrations of these
cations in calcite, for example, appear to control
the intensity of the luminescence (Fairchild, 1983).
Other cations such as lead and certain rare earth
t A more detailed discussion of the origin and history of
CL is provided in the excellent book by Marshall (1988)
and the review by Walker (1985).

Textural and Mineralogical Analysis 21
elements may also control or influence luminescence
intensity (Mason & Mariano, 1989).
CL in quartz has received increased attention in
the last few years (Zinkernagel, 1978; Ramseyer
et al., 1988; Walker et al., 1989). It is apparent that
changes in the colour of quartz luminescence are
controlled by trace element impurities in the crys-
tal lattice and defects such as non-bonding Si-O
(Ramseyer et al., 1988). Depending on the nature of
the defect and impurity, quartz luminescence may
range in hue from brown to red to blue (Table 2.7).
Diagenetic quartz, precipitated at relatively low
temperatures,
has
a characteristic
blue colour.
Irrespective of our current level of understanding of
the precise origin of CL, the technique is still of
immense value as a petrographic tool for the dif-
ferentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases and in
understanding mineral paragenesis.
2.3.2 Analytical techniques
CL applications fall into three areas according to
the apparatus used: cold CL, hot CL or scanning
electron microscopy-CL (SEM-CL; Table 2.1). The

a low angle of incidence onto the sample surface,
activating luminescence which can then be viewed
through an ordinary optical microscope (Fig. 2.7).

22 Chapter 2
The cold luminoscope is so-called because of its
lower operating voltage of 15- 20 kV, compared to
the hot luminoscope. This lower voltage means that
only minerals requiring low energy levels to activate
CL, chiefly carbonates, and less commonly, quartz,
can be studied.
Hot luminoscopes are identical in principle to cold
devices, but require excitation of the electron gun to
several tens of thousands of kilovolts. These instru-
ments are most suitable for examination of sand-
stone samples because quartz luminesces less readily
than carbonates. Quartz cements show up par-
ticularly well using hot CL but carbonates luminesce
too brightly and may volatilize in the hot device
(Burley et ai., 1989). Only a handful of hot lumi-
noscopes exist, and there are no plans to mass
produce them, probably because of the advent of
high-quality SEM-CL detectors. This is perhaps a
pity, because the information provided by hot CL
colour images is informative and the pictures are
stunning.
SEM-CL is currently the biggest growth area
in luminescence technology. The SEM-CL device
comprises
a
luminescence detector
attached
to
a SEM. The basic SEM bombards samples with
electrons in a vacuum as part of its normal operating
procedure (Section 2.5) and visible (CL) light is
emitted as part of this process. In the past, capturing
the luminescence was achieved using an elliptical
mirror focused onto an optical fibre. The mirror
design led to problems with inefficient light capture
which have since been overcome by use of a parabolic
mirror (Kearsley & Wright, 1988). The SEM-CL
detector is used principally for the examination of
sandstones because the slow decay of carbonate
luminescence leads to bright smears across the
image as the electron beam scans across the sample
(Kearsley & Wright, 1988). The advantages of the
SEM-CL detector over the hot device include its
relatively simple operation and the availability of
other SEM-based analytical tools which can be used
on the same sample area.
2.3.3 Sample preparation
CL is a surface phenomenon and luminescence
can be obtained from any highly polished surface,
whether it be a rock chip or a thin-section. Usually,
uncovered polished thin-sections are used for CL so
that the sample can also be used for conventional
petrography. Doubly polished fluid inclusion wafers
(Section 3.2) are also suitable. The main require-
ment for CL is that the surface be extremely smooth.
Conventional thin-sections are not highly polished
enough,
and

imaging
and
shadowing may arise from points of high relief on
the specimen. For best results, samples should be
finished with a 0.25 ~m diamond paste. Stained
samples can be used for CL, but the stain tends to be
discoloured by the electron beam and the reaction
of the staining solution with the rock surface will
also reduce the quality of the surface finish. In
general, staining techniques should be applied to
samples after CL, or alternatively the stain should
be removed prior to CL by polishing.
2.3.4 Applications of CL
Despite the range of CL technology, the three
devices supply essentially the same information for
carbonates and siliciclastics (Table 2.1):
1 differentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases;
and
2 information on mineral paragenesis.
In carbonates, qualitative information on the oxida-
tion state of the diagenetic environment may also be
obtained because of our better understanding of the
origin of their luminescence.
CL has been used with spectacular success to
differentiate detrital from diagenetic quartz (the
problems associated with conventional microscopic
differentiation
have
been
discussed
in
Section
2.2.1). Figure 2.8a is a SEM-CL image of sandstone
taken from the same sample as Fig. 2.2b. The grey
luminescent quartz cement can be readily distin-
guished
from
the

grain. CL has also been used to distinguish detrital
from diagenetic feldspars. In the cold CL, detrital
feldspars may luminesce very brightly, as brilliant
blues, reds and greens, whereas diagenetic over-
growths tend to be non-luminescent or very dully
luminescent (Kastner, 1971). Feldspar luminescence
has been used in sediment provenance studies,
although at this stage there is no evidence to suggest
any link between feldspar luminescence hue or
intensity and specific igneous or metamorphic origins
(Stow & Miller, 1984). CL has also been used in
sandstones
to
provide
quantitative
information
about the diagenetic behaviour of cemented and
uncemented sandstones from a variety of maximum
burial depths. In a classic paper, Houseknecht (1988)
used cold CL (which proved to be surprisingly effec-
tive in this case) on samples of Palaeozoic and
Mesozoic sandstones to determine whether sutured

ing the amount of quartz cement that had been

Houseknecht was able to classify sandstones at
certain depth ranges as silica importers or exporters.
In carbonates, CL has been used chiefly to dis-
tinguish original depositional material from altered
depositional carbonate and cement. CL is com-
monly used as a screening tool to determine whether
calcite tests of certain organisms are original pre-
cipitates, or whether they have been diagenetically
altered. This is particularly important when sam-
ples are to be used for isotopic analysis in isotope
stratigraphy studies. Samples of the Carboniferous
brachiopod

were
screened in
some detail by Popp et al. (1986b) using the cold CL.

England, by Emery and Dickson (1989) to identify a
much more restricted generation of zoned fresh-
water lens cements in Jurassic limestones of eastern
England and by Read and his students (e.g. Grover
& Read, 1983; Dorobek, 1987) to identify the effects
of freshwater diagenesis in Palaeozoic carbonates of
Virginia. On a cautionary note, the production of
complex zonation patterns in carbonates need not
be related solely to iron and manganese concentra-
tions, as other elements are known to activate or
quench luminescence (Mason, 1987). Furthermore,
Reeder et al. (1990) have produced synthetic zoned
calcites in the laboratory from a single starting
fluid with constant Eh and pH, demonstrating that
factors unrelated to the bulk fluid composition or
chemical environment may be responsible for caus-
ing zonation in carbonate cements (possibly kinetic
effects related to crystal growth).
Quartz cement stratigraphy is a less well estab-
lished technique, partly because the appropriate

& Rimstidt, 1989). Non-luminescent, iron- and

Areas of brightly luminescent calcite contammg
manganese (which is not precipitated by organisms
under normal marine conditions; Frank et al., 1982;
Barnaby & Rimstidt, 1989) were rejected. Areas
of non-luminescent calcite were believed to be
diagenetically unaltered and were sampled for stable
and strontium isotopic analysis. Recently, however,
Rush and Chafetz (1990) have questioned this
luminescence screening procedure by demonstrating
that luminescent, obviously altered brachiopods
and non-luminescent brachiopods have identical
isotopic compositions,
suggesting
that
all
have
undergone significant diagenetic alteration. A lack
of luminescence is a requirement for demonstrat-
ing a lack of diagenetic alteration, but does not
necessarily prove it.
CL has been used successfully in the study of
mineral paragenesis, particularly in cement strati-
graphy (the study of the spatial relationships of
similar cement generations) to subdivide one or two
generations of calcite (or other carbonates) estab-
lished using conventional light microscopy, into
many further 'zones' or 'stages' (Miller, 1988).
Cement stratigraphy in carbonates involves building
up a paragenetic sequence of different cement gen-
erations
using
CL
(and
other
complementary
petrographic disciplines), and correlating the dis-
tributions of individual cement zones (Fig. 2.8b).
There are no rules as to how the different generations
should be subdivided, although Miller (1988) has
suggested a unifying terminology for description of
carbonate luminescence. The champion of carbonate
cement stratigraphy is Meyers, who in 1974 and 1978
published classic papers on the cement stratigraphy
of Mississippian carbonates across many sample
locations in New Mexico. The distribution of these
cement zones suggested that a regional freshwater
aquifer system controlled diagenesis for much of
the post-depositional history of the carbonates. The
different luminescence intensities were shown by
microprobe analyses to be related to the relative
concentrations of manganese and ferrous iron in
the lattice of the calcite cements (Section 2.3.1),
and hence to the oxidation state of the diagenetic
environment (Fig. 2.9; Barnaby & Rimstidt, 1989).
Input of fresh, oxidizing waters into the carbonates
resulted in precipitation of non-luminescent, iron-
and manganese-free calcite. As the fresh waters
became more reducing, brightly luminescent calcite
with manganese was precipitated, followed by dully
luminescent calcite containing both ferrous iron
and manganese. The characteristic luminescence

technology has only been widely used in recent
years, but mainly because the relationship between
CL colour, chemistry and prevailing diagenetic con-
ditions is less well understood than it is for car-
bonates. Probably the best work to date on quartz
cement paragenesis and stratigraphy is by Burley
et al. (1989) on quartz (and many other) cements
in the Jurassic Piper Formation sandstones of the
Tartan Oilfield, UKCS.
The final application of CL, particularly in car-
bonates, is in cement fabric description. Dickson
(1983) has shown how neomorphic calcite can be
distinguished from calcite cement based on CL
zonation patterns. CL can also help reveal ghosts
of precursor grains or cements (Lee & Harwood,
1989), and complex zonation patterns, such as sector
zoning (Reeder & Grams, 1987) which may not be
visible by any other technique. For further reading
on the types and origin of complex intracrystalline
zonation patterns, the reader is referred to Sellwood
(1989).
As a concluding point, the application of CL
technology to understanding siliciclastic and car-
bonate diagenesis can no longer be regarded as
an optional extra, and should form a standard
petrographic tool because its value in differentiat-
ing detrital from
diagenetic phases, unravelling
cement paragenesis and stratigraphy, and in cement
fabric analysis is unrivalled. Future lines of CL
research lie in improving our understanding of its
origin, especially in silicate minerals, and ultimately
in using CL colour and intensity to provide quantita-
tive information about elemental concentration and
lattice defects.
2.4 Ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy
2.4.1 Introduction
Ultraviolet fluorescence (UVF) is the visible light
response of materials exposed to ultraviolet light (in
the wavelength range 200-300 nm). UVF is used
routinely in petroleum geology in the detection of
oil on rock samples, commonly drilling cuttings or
cores. These are
known as hydrocarbon shows
and are indicated by fluorescence of the oil on the
samples. This simple principle has been extended to
microscope work, with UV light sources available
for conventional microscopes. Various wavelengths
of UV can be selected by means of filters which
can be interposed during UV emission. Two dif-
ferent types of information are available from UVF
Textural and Mineralogical Analysis 25
microscopy.
Firstly,
petroleum
fluid
inclusions,
often present in diagenetic minerals, can be detected
relatively easily by their bright fluorescence (Section
3.5.4). The second application of UVF is in mineral
paragenesis studies, particularly in cement fabric
analysis. There are two main shortcomings with
UVF microscopy. The first is that inorganic mater-
ials such as calcite generally display only weak UV
fluorescence, and only certain samples appear to
provide
any
paragenetically
useful
information.
UVF is certainly not a substitute for CL microscopy
in this respect. The other problem is our limited
understanding at present of the origin of UVF. It is
clear that included organic matter causes fluores-
cence but there may be other causes, such as trace
elements and/or rare earth elements. The technique
could
therefore
potentially
provide
information
about the chemistry of fluids which have precipitated
fluorescing phases.
2.4.2 Applications of UVF
Sample preparation for UVF microscopy is essen-
tially the same as for CL; a highly polished thin-
section is ideal. Doubly polished fluid inclusion
wafers are also suitable. UVF has been most success-
ful with carbonates. Dravis and Yurewicz (1985)
were able to resolve the timing of burial dolomitiza-
tion relative to porosity evolution using blue-light
(slightly longer wavelength than UV) fluorescence
to see relict grains which were invisible with stand-
ard microscopy. UVF can also be used to show
cement fabrics which may be invisible using both
standard and CL microscopy (Fig. 2.10). Emery and
Marshall (1989) demonstrated the value of UVF in
conjunction with CL in emphasizing sector zonation
in calcite cements and Miller (1988) has discussed
how organic-rich fossils in reefs show up very well in
UV light, but cannot be seen in the visible part of
the spectrum. At present, UVF is a useful tool for
obtaining qualitative cement fabric information in
carbonates, but its limitations will remain until we
better understand the origin of fluorescence.
2.5 Scanning electron microscopy
2.5.1 Introduction
The high magnifications (x 20 to x 100000) attain-
able, and extreme depth of field make SEM an
excellent tool for examining the details of mineral
morphology,
grain-cement
relationships,
and

porosity, especially microporosity. Since the first
commercial SEM was produced in 1965, a whole
range of additional techniques and applications have
become available to complement standard
high
magnification microscopy. These include backscatter
electron imaging, SEM-CL (discussed in Section
2.3) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis.
The basic operation of the SEM is illustrated in
Fig. 2.11. An electron gun produces a stream of
electrons in a vacuum, across which an accelerating
voltage is applied. Electromagnetic lenses produce
a small demagnified image of the electron source
which is scanned or 'rastered' across the surface of
the specimen. On striking the specimen, two types
of electron are emitted: high energy backscattered
electrons and lower energy secondary electrons,
some of which may be completely absorbed at certain
depths within the specimen. Cathodoluminescence
and X-rays will also be generated during electron
scanning (see Sections 2.3 and 2.7 respectively).
To create an image, the electron beam scan is
synchronized with that of a cathode ray tube and a
picture built of the scanned area. SEM operation
can be carried out in two modes, both of which yield
different types of information. The microscope is
generally operated in emission mode (SE), in which
secondary and backscattered electrons are collected,
providing a high magnification image. The contrast
in the image produced during normal high magnifica-
tion operation
is a function of the topography
and orientation of the specimen, its chemistry, and
differences in electrical potential on its surface. The
second mode of operation is backscattered mode
(BSE) in which only the backscattered electrons are
captured. The efficiency of electron backscatter from
the surface of a mineral depends on its chemistry,

specifically its mean atomic number. Backscatter
mode operation requires a backscattered electron
collector, such as the Robinson device (no relation;
Pye & Krinsley, 1984).
2.5.2 Sample preparation
Basic sample preparation for observation of the
surfaces of rock chips in emission mode is relatively
simple, but several important rules need to be fol-
lowed. Firstly, rocks which are oil saturated or con-
tain oil residues such as bitumen need td be cleaned
in solvents, otherwise oil will be vaporized by the
electron bean and make the SEM column dirty,
reducing image quality. Samples which previously
contained water and have dried out in air do not
need to be treated in solvent. Secondly, samples
need to be mounted flat against the mounting stub
using a glue which is stable at high temperatures,
and any loose material on the sample surface should
be gently removed. The specimen is then ready for
coating with a conductive material (usually gold or
carbon) to take away the electrical charge which
builds up on the specimen surface during SEM
operation.
One of the major problems with basic sample
preparation is that the air drying process can lead to
damage of delicate crystals by surface tension forces
during the passage of the air-water interface across
them. Fibrous illite in sandstones is particularly
susceptible to damage, causing the delicate fibres to
appear matted on the pore surface, rather than
protruding into the porespace (Fig. 2.12a). A tech-
nique known as critical point drying can eliminate
the surface tension forces present during air drying
(McHardy et al., 1982). This process is time consum-
ing and requires special apparatus, but the contribu-
tion it makes to an improved understanding of the
sample texture can be considerable (McHardy &
Birney, 1987; Trewin, 1988).
Samples for backscattered electron imaging must
have a highly polished surface. Polished thin-sections
are ideal, and are of course suitable for other tech-
niques such as CL and UVF. Prior to BSEM analysis,
however, the sample must be carbon coated and
mounted on a stub.
2.5.3 Applications of emission mode SEM
The main applications of emission mode SEM are
(Table 2.1):
1 mineral identification;
Textural and Mineralogical Analysis 27
2 differentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases;
3 mineral textural observations; and
4 porosity description.
These applications parallel closely those of trans-
mitted light microscopy. However, SEM comes into
its own when higher magnifications are required to
resolve ambiguous paragenetic relationships, or
details of the morphology of fine grained minerals,
such as the fibrous illite illustrated in Fig. 2.12a.
Mineral identification using the SEM is helped by
the energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDS),
which permits elemental distributions to be obtained
for single spots of 1/lm diameter, or for the entire
screen area (Trewin, 1988). This information is
commonly used to supplement morphological and
textural observations of mineral types. The SEM is
also a useful tool for distinguishing detrital from
diagenetic minerals, especially clays. Figure 2.12b
shows a sandstone sample with platy or 'leafy' illite
and fibrous illite. The platy illite is interpreted to
represent an earlier, probably detrital phase, intro-
duced by muddy water flowing through the sand and
trapped against the grain surface, whereas the fibrous
illite is interpreted to be a later diagenetic phase.
The interpretation of two illite generations with
quite different origins would have implications for
any further geochemical analysis, such as K-Ar
dating. There would be little point in dating all the
illite in this sample as the date would simply be a
weighted average of the age of the detrital phase
(of uncertain origin, but commonly older than the
depositional age of the sandstone itself) and that of
the authigenic fibrous illite. To determine the age of
the fibrous illite only, the two would have to be
physically separated. SEM observations on the size
ranges of the different illites can be used to design
the separation process.
Textural
information
obtained
from
emission
mode SEM can be used to construct paragenetic
histories (Burley, 1984, 1986; Huggett, 1984, 1986;
Kantorowicz,
1985).
Figure 2.12c shows quartz
cement enclosing kaolinite, suggesting that the
kaolinite was precipitated first. In Fig. 2.12d, from
the same sample, the kaolinite appears to rest on
the surface of the quartz grain, suggesting that the
quartz came first. We could conclude from these
observations that quartz and kaolinite precipitation
were broadly contemporaneous, or that there are
two generations of kaolinite, one earlier than and
one later than the quartz.
The SEM in emission mode is also useful for
observing porosity, particularly microporosity and

connectivity between pores. Figure 2.12e shows a
partially dissolved feldspar grain with microporosity.
The orientation of the etch pits is parallel to the
cleavage planes, but their size suggests that they
would probably not contribute to the effective
porosity (connected porosity within a rock through
which fluids will flow) of the rock. The texture and
packing of dolomite crystals in a dolomitized lime-
stone show that effective, connected porosity is
present (Fig. 2.12f). The SEM is commonly used to

30 Chapter 2
examine the microporosity that is characteristic
of chalks, which is very difficult to see using a
petrographic microscope (Fig. 2.12g).
2.5.4 Applications of backscatter mode SEM
The main applications of backscatter mode SEM
(BSEM) are (Table 2.1):
1 mineral identification;
2 mineral chemistry; and
3 porosity description.
Mineral identification by BSEM relies on the
increase in the efficiency of electron scattering as
the mean atomic number of the mineral increases.
Quartz, with a lower mean atomic number than
calcite, will reflect electrons less efficiently and give
a duller grey image. Pyrite, with a very high mean
atomic number, will reflect electrons very efficiently
and produce an intense white image. Grey levels can
therefore be used as a qualitative guide to mineralogy
(although minerals with entirely different chemical
compositions, but similar mean atomic numbers,
will give similar grey levels). Figure 2.13a shows a
BSEM image of a sandstone: quartz grains are
medium grey and form the bulk of the sample,
which is cemented by light grey carbonate and very
dull grey booklets of kaolinite. The bright grain
right of centre is rutile; other bright specks are
probably pyrite. A few light grey feldspars, of similar
intensity to the carbonate can also be distinguished.
Porosity is shown in black because the mean atomic
number of the polymer resin filling the porespaces is
very low.
(a)
BSEM can be used to detect chemical zonation in
minerals which may not be visible in stained thin-
sections or by cathodoluminescence. Figure 2.13b
shows zoning in ankerite that would not be visible in
CL because of the quenching effect of the iron
(Section 2.3). The change in the mean atomic num-
ber of the ankerite from zone to zone is clearly
picked out by BSEM.
BSEM is a particularly powerful tool for porosity
description because of the great mean atomic num-
ber contrast between the colour of the impregnating
polymer resin (appearing as black) and the rock
matrix (variable mean atomic number, ranging from
dark grey to white). This contrast can be detected by
image analysis software and has given rise to a new
branch of petrographic science referred to as pore
image analysis (PIA; Section 2.9).
2.6 Transmission electron microscopy
2.6.1 Introduction
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) involves
the transmission of an electron beam through a
thinned sample in a vacuum, analogous to optical
microscopy
using
transmitted
light.
The
main
requirement for specimen observation is that speci-
mens should be thin enough to allow electrons to
pass through. Individual clay fibres may be suitable
but other minerals have to be thinned by an ion beam
to a thickness of a few nanometres. The advantage
of extreme sample thinness is that accurate quantita-
tive chemical analyses can be obtained from areas as

1.5 mm. (b) Zoned ankerite cement, Carboniferous sandstone, Bothamsall Oilfield, East Midlands, UK. The change in

small as 5-10 nm in diameter as there is negligible
spreading of the beam and no absorption or fluores-
cence effects to correct for.
The performance of today's TE microscopes is
so advanced that high resolution images showing
sub-unit cell detail can be obtained, with magnifica-
tions up to x 500000 commonly used to obtain lattice
fringe images. Highly detailed textural information
can be obtained at magnifications of a few thousand
to about x 30000. This range is particularly suitable
for examination of clay minerals (Sudo et al., 1981).
However, the quality of the information obtained in

the TE microscope is only as good as the sample
preparation and orientation.
2.6.2 Sample preparation
TEM analysis requires preparation of samples so
that they are transparent to electrons. Rock samples
are normally prepared as polished thin-sections
which are then thinned by ion-beam milling until
holes begin to appear (Phakey et al., 1972). Areas of
the sample adjacent to the holes may then be thin
enough to be transparent to the electron beam. This

32 Chapter 2
tends to be a bit of a hit and miss process. Clay
mineral separates can also be analysed using TEM.
Sample separation is essentially the same as that
described for clay fraction X-ray diffraction (Section
2.7), following which the clay particles are dispersed
in very dilute suspensions and mounted on a metal
microgrid (Nadeau & Tait, 1987).
2.6.3 Applications ofTEM
Applications of TEM fall into the area of high
resolution mineralogical and textural analysis, par-
ticularly of clay minerals, and provide the following
information:
1 differentiation of detrital from diagenetic phases;
2 mineral textural relationships; and
3 mineral chemistry.
TEM is particularly useful for differentiation of
detrital from diagenetic clays and other fine par-
ticulate matter. Figure 2.14a shows a fine fraction
mount under the TEM. Laths of fibrous illite -
almost certainly ofdiagenetic origin - are visible and
there is a smaller quantity of unidentifiable opaque
matter. This sample was intended for further K- Ar
dating and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope
analyses but the presence of opaque matter sug-
gested that further separation would be required
before the sample became sufficiently pure. The
very high resolution of TEM is potentially excellent
for clarifying ambiguities in mineral paragenetic
sequences. In Fig. 2.14b, quartz cement includes
kaolinite platelets, suggesting that some of the
quartz cement post-dated kaolinite precipitation. A
later phase of illite is also visible. In practice, many
samples need to be prepared to provide textural
information because of the rather random nature
of the ion-beam milling process which cannot be
guaranteed to thin areas of interest.
Chemical analysis by TEM can also be performed
on thinned samples, or on dispersed clay fractions
and can be a useful supplement to textural informa-
tion, particularly on clay mineral fractions prior
to isotopic analysis. Illite and illite-smectite for
example tend to look rather similar.
Chemical
analysis using TEM confirms that those in Fig. 2.14a
are true illites (Table 2.8; see also Ireland et al.,
1983; Warren & Curtis, 1989).
2.7 X-ray diffraction
2.7.1 Introduction
X-rays
are
electromagnetic
radiation
produced
when an electron beam hits a substance and causes
rapid deceleration of the electrons. In conventional
diffraction, the X-ray tube is arranged so that elec-
trons strike a target which produces X-rays of
known wavelengths, which can be further filtered to
produce radiation of a single wavelength which can
be directed at the sample in the diffractometer. The
wavelength of X-rays used ranges from 0.05 to
0.25 nm. The sample is rotated in the beam so that
crystallographic planes diffract X-rays as they reach
the appropriate angle. The relationship of X-ray
wavelength to the angle of diffraction and the charac-
teristic lattice (or d) spacing of the mineral under
examination forms the basis of all X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis and interpretation, and is known
as Bragg's law (Fig. 2.15). Further details of the
theory of X-ray diffractometry and diffraction equip-
ment are available in Klug and Alexander (1974),
Brindley and Brown (1980) and Eslinger and Pevear
(1988).
The introduction of XRD into the geological
realm allowed the structural identification of min-
erals previously identified by their thin-section

properties alone (Brindley & Brown, 1980). In petro-
leum geology, most XRD work is performed on
powdered samples, providing qualitative informa-
tion on minerals present in whole-rock samples, and
semi-quantitative
information
on
separated fine
fraction (usually clay size) samples (Table 2.1).
Fine fraction analysis is by far the most valuable
application in diagenetic studies (Burley et al.,
1985), particularly when used in conjunction with
other techniques such as thermogravimetry-evolved
water analysis (Section 2.8), when near-quantitative
analyses can be
obtained.
XRD preparation is
destructive of fabric, so that no textural or para-
genetic information can be obtained, and detrital
and diagenetic phases cannot be differentiated.
2.7.2 Sample preparation
For whole rock analysis, samples must be reduced to
5-10 I..lm powder for satisfactory results. Grinding
must be performed carefully to reduce the risk of
damaging crystals by strain, as this can lead to
diffraction line broadening (Klug & Alexander,
1974). Once the sample is ground to the appropriate
size, it can be mounted in two ways for exposure to
the X-ray beam: cavity mounting and smear mount-
ing. Cavity mounting tends to produce better the
random particle orientation required for a good
semi-quantitative analysis: powder is packed into an
Textural and Mineralogical Analysis 33
aluminium cavity mount holder from the rear (with
limited pressure to avoid orienting the crystals;
Klug & Alexander, 1974). Smear mounting involves
smearing the powder onto a glass slide with an
organic solvent such as acetone. This process can
lead to some particle orientation.
Fine fraction analysis is carried out to determine
the mineralogy of particles <21..lm in size, the bulk
of which are clay minerals. Sample preparation
is more involved as the fine fraction needs to be
separated from coarser material. This may not
be a problem with mudrocks but for sandstones a
thorough separation procedure needs to be followed
(Hardy &
Tucker, 1988). Sample pre-treatment
requires removal of carbonate, usually by weak
organic acids to prevent damage to the clay par-
ticles. If large quantities of organic matter are
present, this can be removed by hydrogen peroxide
(Jackson, 1979). The sample is then ready for dis-
aggregation prior to separation, usually achieved by
ultrasonic means. The disaggregated sample is trans-
ferred to a settling column (or a centrifuge to speed
the settling process) and allowed to stand until
the required size fraction, calculated according to
Stokes' law, can be removed (Galehouse, 1971b;
Hardy & Tucker, 1988). A major difficulty with clay
mineral separation is the tendency for particles
to flocculate, forming larger aggregates which may
settle faster and fall outside the desired fine fraction
size range. Flocculation can be minimized by adding
a deflocculant such as sodium hexametaphosphate
(Calgon). The separated fine fraction can be mounted
as an oriented or unoriented mount for XRD ana-
lysis. The objective of orienting the sample is to
ensure that the clay plates lie parallel to the slide or
tile surface and to avoid differential settling of the
clays. In practice, this is often difficult to achieve
(Towe, 1974). Oriented samples can be prepared
by smearing the clay slurry onto a glass slide, by
evaporating the clay suspension onto a slide in a
beaker, or by sedimenting the suspension onto
a porous substrate such as a ceramic tile under
vacuum. Unoriented samples are prepared by cavity
mounting, although the pressure applied to fill the
cavity usually results in some orientation of the
sample (this can be minimized by embedding the
samples in a resin such as Araldite, or by regrinding
the particles to approximately equal lengths).
Further treatments may be applied to help dis-
tinguish different clay types, particularly where dif-
fraction peaks overlap. In addition to normal air
drying, these treatments usually comprise glycol

solvation, heating to 375°C, and further heating
to 550°C. Glycol treatment will cause expandable
clays such as smectites to swell, increasing their d
spacing. Heat treatment will cause certain clays
partially or entirely to collapse, or may increase the
intensity of diffraction peaks
(chlorite;
Starkey
et al., 1984).
2.7.3 Applications of XRD
The two main applications of XRD to petroleum
geology are (Table 2.1):
1 rapid
mineralogical
analysis
of
whole-rock
samples; and
2 clay mineral identification and quantification from
mineral separates.
Whole-rock XRD provides information about the
mineralogy of a sample without differentiating its
detrital or diagenetic origin. It is particularly useful
in rapid identification of minerals that may cause
problems during drilling, well testing*, petroleum
production or reservoir stimulation and can be
applied to samples which cannot be prepared for
thin-section analysis, such as poorly consolidated
core samples, or drilling cuttings. The speed of
XRD whole-rock analysis is a major advantage in
petroleum geology where the mineralogical com-
position of a reservoir interval needs to be deter-
mined very rapidly, often while a well is still drilling.
* Testing (or drill-stem testing) a well involves dropping
the pressure in the well bore and allowing petroleum to
flow from the reservoir, through the drill-stem to the
surface. Testing can provide information about the perme-
ability and potential rate of flow of petroleum from the
reservoir, and its dimensions and continuity.
Some clay minerals affect the performance of a
reservoir during testing and their presence needs to
be rapidly looked for by XRD. These include loosely
bound
kaolinite,
which
may
physically
migrate
though
the
reservoir
(Khilar
&
Fogler,
1984;
Amaefule et al., 1987), and swelling clays such
as smectites which may expand and block pores
(Hewitt, 1963). In addition, certain reservoir inter-
vals may produce petroleum more readily if they
are acidizedt before testing. Some clay minerals
may react with acids, particularly HF, causing the
precipitation of silica (Crowe, 1986). Figure 2.16 is
a typical whole-rock XRD trace from a reservoir
sandstone. From a quick inspection of the peaks and
relative peak heights, it is evident that the sample
contains significant amounts of quartz and calcite,
minor feldspars, and possibly small quantities of clay
minerals. Calcite might be susceptible to dissolution
and reprecipitation during acidization.
The
main
application
of
XRD
to
sediment
diagenesis is in fine fraction analysis. This technique
is slower than whole-rock XRD because sample
preparation is more complicated, but it is far better
for identifying clay mineral types and can provide
semi-quantitative information on the relative propor-
tions of clay minerals in samples. When used in
conjunction with thermogravimetry-evolved water
analysis (Section 2.8), fine fraction analysis can
provide near-quantitative data on very small propor-
tions of clay minerals in reservoir rocks. Figure 2.17
is from a fine fraction separated from a reservoir
t Acidization of a well is the introduction of acid into the
reservoir to leach cement phases which may be occluding
pores.

porated in the results for Fig. 2.17.
2 Probably the greatest disadvantage is that quant-
itative clay mineral information relates solely to
that fraction being analysed and does not give any
information about the proportions of clay minerals
in the whole rock. This problem may be overcome
by the simultaneous application of clay mineral
fine fraction quantification and thermogravimetry-
evolved water analysis (Section 2.8).
It is essential to bear in mind the shortcomings of
XRD data when interpreting whole rock and fine

sandstone. In this case, an oriented mount has been
used which has been subjected to various treatments
(air drying, glycol solvation, heating to 375°C and
heating to 550°C) to help identify different clay
mineral components. The diffraction intensity (1)
for each clay mineral can be determined from the air
dried trace (Fig. 2.17) by integration of peak area
above background (Fig. 2.18), and can be calculated
for single peaks and overlapping peaks. To calculate
clay mineral percentages, Weir et al. 's (1975) equa-
tion is commonly used:
I(Kaolinite).

+ I(I1hte) + I(Smectlte)
+ I(C~I~ite) = 100%
The divisors beneath kaolinite and chlorite correct
for the relatively greater X-ray responses of these
minerals (this passes any error in one mineral per-
centage on to the others). For the reservoir sand-
stone in Fig. 2.17, a known percentage of an internal
standard, boehmite (y-AIOOH with a characteristic
diffraction pattern; Griffin, 1954), was added to the
fine fraction. The following clay mineral percentages
were obtained: kaolinite, 84 ± 2%; illite (probably
interstratified illite-smectite), 16±2%; no pure
smectite or chlorite.
However, both methods may be affected by two
factors which will limit the accuracy of quantitative
analysis.

fraction traces. Nevertheless, it remains an essential
tool for rapid scrutiny of whole rock samples and
differentiation of clay mineral types in fine fractions.
2.8 Thermogravimetry-evolved water
analysis
2.8.1 Introduction
Thermogravimetry
(TG)-evolved
water
analysis
(EWA) is the quantitative analysis of the water
evolved from a sample on heating and is suitable for
analysis of rocks containing a proportion of hydrous
phases such as clay minerals. Although TG-EWA
will not easily distinguish between different clay
minerals in a sample, it can provide very accurate
information about its total clay mineral content
because the amount of water vapour driven off from
the clay lattice is directly proportional to the total
clay content (Primmer & Thornley, 1991). Such
information cannot be obtained with any accuracy
by whole-rock XRD. Accurate determinations of
clay minerals amounts in reservoir sandstones are
important, as even small quantities of certain clays
(particularly fibrous
illite) can seriously impair
reservoir quality.
2.8.2 Analytical techniques
The sample requirement for TG-EWA is the bulk
rock plus the fine fraction separated for XRD ana-
lysis. The fine fraction XRD analysis must be done
before thermogravimetry, as the heating process
destroys the clay minerals. TG-EWA instrumenta-
tion comprises
a
high precision
thermobalance
which is used to record continuously the weight loss
of a sample as it is heated at a controlled rate to
temperatures of 1000°C (Fig. 2.19). Dry nitrogen
gas is passed around the sample which is located
within a high temperature furnace. Water evolved
from the sample is transferred with the nitrogen
carrier gas to an infrared water vapour analyser
which monitors the water vapour concentration in
the carrier gas and expresses the dehydroxylation
information in terms of structural water content as a
weight fraction of the clay mineral. Most hydroxyl
groups in clay minerals are driven from the lattice
at temperatures between 300 and 900°C. A typical
TG-EWA profile for the dehydroxylation of sand-
stone with a variety of clay mineral types is shown
in Fig. 2.20. TG-EWA alone cannot distinguish
between these clay mineral types: clay minerals do

dehydroxylate over different temperature intervals,
but their peaks are broad and cannot be resolved.
2.8.3 Applications of TG-EWA
The main application of TG-EWA is in the quanti-
fication of clay mineral quantities in sandstones,
often to very high degrees of accuracy. To demon-
strate this application, we will return to the reservoir
sandstone fine fraction analysis discussed in Section
2.7.3. Knowing the clay mineral percentages as a
proportion of the fine fraction, we will use TG-
EWA to determine what percentage of the sand-
stone the clay fine fraction makes up. For this
purpose, the fine fraction and sample from which
it was disaggregated must be recombined before
placing in the thermobalance. TO analysis reveals

a weight loss from the sandstone of 0.54%. Com-
parison with the EWA trace indicates that this
weight loss is entirely due to dehydration of hydrous
phases. From this information, the calculated fine
fraction percentage in the whole rock is 3.7 ± 0.3%.
The fine fraction XRD results (Section 2.7.3) give us
the relative proportions of the clay minerals, so
their absolute abundances can now be calculated:
kaolinite 3.57 ± 0.16% and illite 0.68 ± 0.12%.
Most of the uncertainties of the TG-EWA XRD
method are introduced during XRD analysis. How-
ever, if there are significant quantities of hydrous
phases which are too coarse to form part of the
fine fraction, this can introduce an additional error.
For
example,
detrital
mica
flakes
(particularly
muscovite) will lose water, but may not constitute
part of the fine fraction. A correction can be applied
by point-counting thin-sections to estimate the con-
tribution of mica to the TG-EWA response, but this
will lead to further error, as well as adding to the
length of time required for sample processing.
2.9 Pore image analysis
2.9.1 Introduction
Pore image analysis (PIA) is a technique which
quantifies and analyses the size and shape of pores
seen in two-dimensional rock thin-sections (Ehrlich
et al., 1984; Ehrlich & Davies, 1989; McCreesh
et aI., 1991). This is done by digitizing the images
of resin-filled pores in polished thin-sections using
backscatter SEM or conventional microscopy. It
does not provide any information about the origin of
the pores, but it does give an immense amount of
information about pore geometries which can be
empirically related to petrophysical properties, such
as permeability and water saturation*. If a reliable
relationship can be established between features of
pore size distributions and permeability and water
saturation, PIA will have two main advantages over
conventional methods of measuring permeability
and saturation:
1 speed of analysis, which equates to cost; and
2 measurements can be made on samples as small as
drilling cuttings.
2.9.2 Analytical techniques
Pore image analysis can be carried out using conven-
tional microscope images or using backscatter elec-
tron microscopy. BSEM has two advantages: its
higher resolution capable of measuring features of
pores as small as 1Jlm in diameter and its ability
to differentiate between minerals so that mineral-
ogical image analysis may be performed on the same
sample. Both methods require image analysis soft-
ware, with a significant computer memory to store
and analyse thin-section images. A monochrome
BSEM image is divided up into a series of pixels and
an appropriate number of grey levels chosen by the
operator. The greater the number of grey levels
specified, the larger the memory requirement for the
computer. The resulting digital image can then be
manipulated using a range of software routines.
For image analysis of pores alone, a single grey

level detection threshold must be specified so that
pores can be distinguished from minerals. Pores
are identified under BSEM by their blackness, and
in conventional microscopy by their intensity in
transmitted light, making them relatively easy to
separate from the rest of the image. Once this is
done, the image processing routines can be used to
measure the dimensions and certain morphological
parameters of the pores. Pore parameters that are
commonly measured include the area (A), perimeter
(P), length (longest diameter) and breadth (shortest
diameter). From these measurements, three other
parameters are commonly derived: the equivalent
circular diameter (ECD = 41tA 1/2), the
round-
ness (R = A41t/p2) and a shape factor (shape =
length/breadth). These can be rapidly obtained for
thousands of pores per sample, at a magnification
predetermined by the operator. PIA will often be
carried out at several different magnifications on the
same sample, as pore sizes may range from 111m up
to hundreds of micrometres.
2.9.3 Applications of PIA
Once a PIA dataset is obtained, the task of com-
paring the parameters with permeability or petro-
physical
measurements
begins.
This
is
usually
achieved by cross-plotting permeabilities against
PIA parameters which are likely to exert a control
on permeability. Figure 2.21 shows a cross-plot of
the 95th percentile of the ECD (equivalent circular
diameter of the largest pores) versus log permeability
for two reservoir sandstones from the North Sea. In
both cases the correlation is good; the slopes of the
best-fit lines are however quite different demonstrat-
ing that there is no unique relationship for all sand-
stones. The relationship suggests that permeability
is controlled predominantly by the largest pores,

because higher proportions of larger pores provide
better connectivity through which fluids can flow.
The relationships can be used to predict permeability
from ECD (95th percentile) alone, quickly and from
small samples unsuitable for permeability measure-
ments by core analysis.
There is also a relationship between ECD (50th
percentile) and irreducible water saturation (Swi)*
for one of the reservoir sandstones examined above
(Fig. 2.22). Although the correlation is not as good
as in Fig. 2.21, there is a clear fall in Swi with
increasing pore size. This relationship can also be
interpreted geologically: smaller pores are more
likely to retain formation water than larger ones.
PIA does have significant limitations. It will be of
little use when there is a poor correlation of an
essential reservoir property with a PIA parameter,
and when no clear geological explanation exists
for an empirically derived correlation. Under such

circumstances, PIA parameters should not be used
to measure reservoir quality.
Additional limita-
tions concern the analytical technique itself, chiefly
whether two-dimensional porosity information can
really be used to give higher-dimensional informa-
tion such as permeability. Proponents of PIA argue
that the sample coverage of thousands of pores is
statistically significant enough to provide a three-
dimensional view of pore parameters. More recent
work has involved taking parallel serial thin-sections
every few tens of micrometres from a sample and
comparing PIA parameters from sample to sample
to give a three-dimensional PIA view. This is very
time consuming and rather defeats the object of
quick and cheap analyses from small samples. To
sum up, PIA is still in its infancy and further research
is required before we fully understand the meaning
of many of the PIA-petrophysical correlations. For
the present, if a good PIA-petrophysical correla-
tion exists for a sound geological reason, there is
no reason why it should not be used to measure
petrophysical parameters.

3.1 Introduction
Fluid inclusions are microscopic pockets of liquid
and/or gas trapped within crystals (Fig. 3.1). They
can provide three basic types of information. Firstly
and most obviously, they are samples of fluids -
waters, petroleum and gases -
once present in
the subsurface, which are available for analysis.
Secondly, provided that there is no leakage of mater-
ial into or out of the inclusions after trapping,
they can provide an estimate of the temperature at
which the fluid became included in the mineral host.
Indeed, together with oxygen isotope analysis which
we will discuss in Chapter 4, fluid inclusions con-
stitute the most important type of geothermometer.
Thirdly, they can provide estimates of fluid density.
We are most interested in temperature and fluid
composition because these can be translated into
three kinds of information of real value to petro-
leum exploration and development (Pagel et al.,
1986; McLimans, 1987; Burruss, 1989):
1 temperature, age and duration of mineral cement
growth;
2 temperature
and
timing of episodes of fluid
migration (including water, oil and gas); and
3 temperature of fracture healing.
The temperature at which a mineral cement grows
can be transformed into an approximate age by
means of a modelled burial history. In this way,
absolute ages can be ascribed to a relative sequence
of mineral growth established by the petrographic
methods described in Chapter 2. Mineral growth
and dissolution are of course major influences on
porosity and permeability, so fluid inclusion geo-
thermometry provides a means of timing modi-
fication of reservoir quality relative to oil or gas
migration, or indeed to any other feature of geo-
logical history*. Fluid inclusions can also tell us
about the petroleum itself. Petroleum fluid inclusions
are common in sedimentary rocks and can be used
to determine what kinds of oil or gas were passing
*The timing of oil and gas generation and migration is
generally estimated by modelling the thermal history of the
source rock (Allen & Allen, 1990).

through the rock sample and approximately when
they did so. If a particular group of fluid inclusions
became trapped in a mineral after it grew, during
healing of a fracture set, any temperatures obtained
from them are not related to mineral growth, but
to palaeo-stress regimes. Stress history is an im-
portant influence on the way in which a reservoir
will behave during a 'Frac' -
hydrofracturing de-
signed to enhance flow of petroleum from a reservoir
rock into the well bore or flow of injection water
from well bore to rock.
If this kind of information is to be reliable, it
cannot be gathered without exercising a consider-
able amount of care. This ought to extend from
sample
selection
and
preparation
through
data
collection to, in particular, interpretation. Unfor-

tunately, fluid
inclusion data from
sedimentary
rocks are frequently gathered and reported perfectly
competently and then interpreted with a lack of
circumspection that represents a triumph of hope
over expectation. It is difficult for non-specialists to
understand where optimistic or unjustified assump-
tions or jumps in logic have been made, or even to
evaluate them when they are spelled out. In this
chapter, we are going to try to provide readers with
the knowledge to interpret data for themselves and
make their own judgements. We hope to do this in a
digestible way by concentrating on the practicalities
of extracting a geologically meaningful set of con-
clusions from fluid inclusion measurements. We will
explain theory and data collection only to an extent
that will allow readers to understand how to interpret
for themselves. The chapter begins with a section on
the relationship of fluid inclusions to the mineral
host. It is vital to sort this out at an early stage. After
all, there's not much point in acquiring an extensive
set of measurements if it's not possible to work out
what they refer to. The bulk of the chapter is then
devoted to microthermometry - the measurement
of the temperatures of phase changes in inclusions as
they are heated and cooled on a microscope stage.

This is a non-destructive technique that provides
information about both temperature and fluid com-
position and is by far the most important method
for acquiring useful data from fluid inclusions. The
chapter concludes with two sections on the chemical
analysis of the fluids in the inclusions. Fluid inclu-
sions are notoriously difficult to analyse, mainly
because
they
are
extremely
small,
particularly
so in mineral cements. As a consequence, almost
every analytical technique devised has at one time or
another been thrown at them (see review by Roedder,
1990). We will cover only those that have been
proved, or are likely in the near future to prove of
some use for analysing those types of fluid inclusion
that are commonly found in sedimentary rocks.
3.2 Relationship to host mineral
Any fluid inclusion study should begin with a
petrographic study. Its purpose is to describe the
setting of the inclusions in the rock fabric and so
ascribe them to groups related to features of the
history of the sample (Fig. 3.2). Mineral growth and
fracturing are the most obvious such features. If this
step is not followed or is done badly, any data

quartz overgrowth and will provide information about the conditions of quartz cement precipitation; inclusion D is
secondary, trapped in the sediment after quartz cementation; inclusion E is related to calcite cement growth; and inclusions
F are secondary and later than both quartz and calcite cement.

inclusions, they lie along planes. (f) The boundary between quartz grain and overgrowth is marked by numerous minute
fluid inclusions up to 5 Ilm long. These must have been trapped as the overgrowth began to grow.

subsequently obtained from the inclusions will be at
best useless and at worst positively misleading.
Most work on fluid inclusions, including petro-
graphy, is carried out on specially prepared thin-
sections. The sections are polished on both sides and
prepared without unnecessary heating that might
damage the inclusions, so that the same sample
material can be used on the heating-cooling micro-
scope stage for microthermometry (Shepherd et al.,
1985). Though sometimes prepared with thicknesses
up to 200/lm so as to contain as many inclusions as
possible, sections much thicker than the 30/lm of
standard thin-sections are not of much use for sand-
stones because of the small crystal size of the mineral
cements. Inclusion petrography can be carried out
on normal thin-sections, but this is best avoided
since the process by which the sections are made
may destroy or damage some inclusions.
Populations of fluid inclusions are denoted prim-
ary or secondary (Fig. 3.3; Roedder, 1984). Prim-
ary inclusions are those trapped during mineral
growth while secondary inclusions are those trapped
at some time afterwards. These distinctions are
extremely important. Data obtained from primary
inclusions can tell
us something about mineral
growth which is often (though not quite always)
what we want to know. Data obtained from second-
ary inclusions will not tell us anything at all about
mineral growth but can provide information about a
phase of fracture healing that post-dated growth

of the host mineral. Secondary inclusions can be
positively identified by their relationship to a healed
fracture: if disposed along a plane that cross-cuts
the mineral host, they are likely to be secondary.
Unfortunately, it is usual to have to resort to nega-
tive evidence in order to identify primary inclusions:
if they are isolated within the mineral host with
no apparent relationship to planar features, then
they are usually considered to be primary. One
further term is often used to classify fluid inclusions.
Pseudosecondary inclusions are those that look
secondary, that is, disposed along planes, but which
were in fact trapped during mineral growth. Two
examples are shown in Figs. 3.3e and f. Criteria like
these are not often found but when they are they
constitute the best kind of textural evidence for
relating a set of fluid inclusions to mineral growth.
Fluid inclusions in diagenetic minerals tend to
be both rare and small. This is especially true of
inclusions in diagenetic quartz. It is not unknown for
a trained operator to scan thin-sections of quartz-
cemented sandstone for an entire day without find-
ing a single inclusion in the cement. When they do
turn up, they are invariably only a few micrometres
long (when less than about 4/lm long, no analysis
of any kind can be made). Petroleum inclusions of
this size appear quite colourless and cannot be dis-
tinguished from aqueous inclusions in transmitted
light. It is therefore vital to scan sections under an
incident ultraviolet light microscope. Oil inclusions

will fluoresce strongly under UV light (though gas
inclusions will generally not). Cathodoluminescence
is another useful tool for linking fluid inclusion
populations to mineral petrography (Section 2.3).
The standard cold cathode luminoscope can be used
for carbonates while either a hot cathode device or a
SEM with a visible light collector will normally be
used to detect luminescence in quartz. The heating
involved in inducing luminescence may damage
inclusions and render them unsuitable for sub-
sequent microthermometry, so CL should be done
afterwaJds to locate inclusions already analysed.
Because
finding fluid inclusions in
diagenetic
minerals can take a very long time, we have experi-
mented with automatic inclusion location by image
analysis. The equipment is illustrated in Fig. 3.4
(p. 45). A c9mputer is used to move the microscope

stage in three dimensions so that an entire doubly
polished thin-section can be scanned in a series of
fields of view. Each is digitized and scanned for
inclusions by the image analyser (Fig. 3.5). The
locations of all inclusions are then recorded so that
the operator can later examine each in turn.
3.3 Microthermometry I - principles
3.3.1 Introduction
Imagine a sandstone buried to a depth of several
kilometres in a sedimentary basin and undergoing
cementation by quartz. As it grows, the quartz
will trap some samples of the pore fluid as fluid
inclusions. Usually, the pore fluid is a solution of a
few major salts, and for the purposes of this example

we will assume that it is a simple NaCI solution. Let
us imagine that the sample is then cored and brought
to the surface. At the reservoir temperature and
pressure, the brine was a single, liquid phase but
when we observe the inclusion under our microscope
at room temperature it will contain the characteristic
assemblage, liquid plus vapour bubble. On a special
microscope stage, we can cool the inclusion still
further and freeze the brine. Suppose we now begin
to reverse the process and heat the inclusion. Salt
and other solutes depress the melting point of ice
(which is why CaClz is spread on roads in winter) so
the temperature at which the ice in the inclusion
melts will reflect the salinity of the fluid. If we keep
heating, the vapour bubble will eventually disappear
and the inclusion will once again contain a single,
liquid phase.
Microthermometry is the observation of the tem-
peratures of phase changes like these that are induced
within fluid inclusions as they are cooled and heated
on a special microscope stage. The example above
shows the two basic kinds of information that the
method can provide: the temperature of ice melting
tells us something about fluid chemistry and the
temperature of bubble disappearance is a minimum
value for the temperature at which the inclusion was
trapped. The more complicated the chemistry of an
inclusion fluid, the greater the number of possible
phase changes. Fortunately in practice, it is usually
only necessary to consider a fairly limited number.
These involve:
1 melting of solids like ice, in the presence of a
vapour bubble (solid + liquid + vapour equilibrium);
2 disappearance·of a vapour bubble into the liquid
phase - the homogenization temperature* (liquid +
vapour equilibrium); and
3 dissolution of a crystal (daughter mineral) in very
concentrated solutions (solid + liquid equilibrium).
In the following sections, we will describe the first
two but not the third, because it is extremely un-
usual to find mineral crystals in fluid inclusions in
diagenetic minerals and even more unusual for these
to dissolve on heating (perhaps suggesting that they
fell into the inclusion cavity before it was sealed
rather than exsolving from the fluid on cooling).
3.3.2 Melting temperatures of solid phases
Salt solutions
Microthermometry
involves
interpreting
phase
changes so the best way of understanding how it
works is to look at some simple phase diagrams.
Figure 3.6 is part of the phase diagram for the
system NaCI-water. A frozen inclusion with bulk
composition I that consists only of Na +, CI.- and
water will contain a mixture of ice and the inter-
mediate salt, hydrohalite (NaCI.2HzO). On heating,
the first liquid wiJl appear at the eutectic tem-
perature, E (-20.8°C) as hydrohalite melts and
eventually disappears. As heating continues and ke
*The homogenization temperature is strictly defined as
that at which the inclusion becomes single-phase on heat-
ing. At room temperature, highly saline fluids can contain
a 'daughter' crystal of halite (or another mineral) which
may dissolve at a temperature higher than that at which
the vapour bubble disappears. The temperature of halite
dissolution is then the homogenization temperature. How-
ever, in sedimentary rocks, inclusions where homogeniza-
tion does not involve the disappearance of a vapour bubble
into a liquid phase are very unusual.

melts, the proportion of liquid increases until at Tm,
the last ice crystal disappears. Three pieces of
information would be recorded:
1 the temperature at which liquid first appears;
2 the temperature of final solid melting; and
3 the last solid to melt (ice or hydrohalite?).
The first - the eutectic temperature - confirms that
the inclusion fluid is indeed a NaCI solution and the
second two - melting of ice at Tm°C - together fix
the bulk composition at 1. Note that if hydrohalite
rather than ice had been the last solid to melt at
Tm°C, a very different bulk salinity would be in-
dicated (I'). This idealized example shows that the
composition of an inclusion fluid can be determined
provided that:
1 the composition of the fluid is known; and
2 the depression of melting point has been experi-
mentally calibrated; that is, that the phase relation-
ships in the system are known.
Most natural waters are not pure NaCI solutions
and, in practice, we rarely have even a qualitative
ionic analysis of inclusion fluids. The composition of
inclusion fluids can however sometimes be guessed
from the temperature at which liquid first appears
because the eutectic is an invariant property of a
particular system. For example, it is quite common
to observe first melting at temperatures close to
.-52°~, the eutectic in the system CaClrNaCl-
wate'r. The main difficulty is that a eutectic is im-
possible to
measure accurately, simply because
a small amount of liquid is almost impossible to see.
This problem becomes acute with the minute inclu-
sions that are so characteristic of most diagenetic
minerals. The approach taken is therefore a prag-
matic one. The temperature at which liquid is first
seen is recorded and often indicates at very least that
the solution is not a simple NaCI solution. Provided
that the last solid to melt is ice, the temperature of
final melting is then interpreted as though the solu-
tion were a simple NaCI brine, producing a number
known as equivalent weight per cent NaCl (eq. wt%
NaCl). This is only a semi-quantitative estimate of
salinity but is still useful for distinguishing between
fluid inclusions, and fluids, of different origins.
Gas hydrates in aqueous inclusions
Many fluids in sedimentary basins contain sub-
stantial amounts of gas in solution. The most com-
mon are CH4 and CO2, but H 2S and N may locally
be abundant and many others can be present in
small quantities.
Most of these gases can form
hydrates known as clathrates that are stable at tem-
peratures close to O°C. Petroleum geologists will
no doubt be familiar with CH4 clathrates because
they form in apparently vast quantities in sediments
beneath deep water and in permafrost regions (their
stability requires a combination of low temperature
and moderate pressure). Clathrates also form when
aqueous fluid inclusions that contain substantial
amounts of dissolved gas are frozen. They can be
detected by their low refractive indices (though this
makes them difficult to see), or more usually by
melting temperatures above O°C.
Clathrates exclude cations from their structures
when they form, causing the salinity of any remain-
ing water to increase. Ice melting then becomes a
misleading indicator of bulk fluid salinity. The melt-
ing temperature of the clathrate is however itself
depressed by the presence of ions in solution and
can be used to estimate salinity provided that the
particular clathrate can be identified and that the
depression of melting point has been experimentally
calibrated. Individual gas clathrates can be identified
by laser Raman spectroscopy (see Section 3.5.2)
but the effort involved is considerable and in any
case the melting point curve is known only for
COrclathrate (Collins, 1979). Clathrate identifica-
tion may nonetheless be important to petroleum
geologists if, for example, they are interested in the
presence of CH4 •
Gas-rich inclusions
Most fluid inclusions in diagenetic minerals are either
aqueous, with or without minor dissolved gas, or
petroleum. Occasionally, however, we have found
inclusions that contain liquid + vapour at room
temperature that are essentially water free, compris-
ing mixtures of CH4 and H2S - natural 'sour' gas
(Fig. 3.1c). A solid phase does not form in these
inclusions
unless they are cooled
below about
-150°C and melts ~n heating at around -90°C. This
is below the triple point of pure H2S and reflects a
depression of the solid + liquid + vapour equilibrium
by the presence of an extra component, CH4• These
identifications were subsequently confirmed by laser
Raman spectroscopy (see Fig. 3.23).

representing the temperature and pressure in an
oil reservoir. When the sample is brought to the
surface, it cools. We make the assumption that over
the temperature interval of interest, the fluid in the
inclusion has constant density. This requires that:
I the inclusion volume remain constant; and
2 there is no leakage of material in or out of the
inclusion*.
As the inclusion cools, its internal pressure is deter-
mined by the PVT properties of water at constant
density and follows a path known as an isochore, a
relationship between the pressure and temperature
of water at constant density (equivalent to constant
molar volume, V). When the internal pressure has
dropped to the point where the isochore intersects

calculate the error involved in assuming that the inclusion
volume is constant and this turns out to be small. Equally,
though leakage of inclusions sometimes does happen dur-
ing analysis, it can generally be recognized.
the two-phase curve (or 'boiling point' curve) at Th ,
a vapour bubble nucleates and continues to grow on
further cooling. At room temperature, the inclusion
then looks like everybody's idea of what a fluid
inclusion should be: it contains two phases -liquid
and a vapour bubble.
If the natural cooling process is reversed by heat-
ing the inclusion on the microscope stage, the bubble
will decrease in size and disappear at Th , the homo-
genization temperature. Th is a minimum value for
the trapping temperature Tt and defines the fluid
density provided that the composition of the fluid
and its PVT properties are known. Note that Th is
not equal to Tt (which cannot in fact be measured at
all!). The homogenization temperature is indeed
always less than the trapping temperature, by an
amount that is confusingly known as the pressure
correction. Determining the pressure correction is
one of the greatest problems in the interpretation of
fluid inclusion data and one to which we will return
in Section 3.4.3.

50 Chapter 3
The behaviour of fluid inclusions containing NaCI
solutions is qualitatively similar to those that con-
tain pure water. The two-phase curve gets an extra
degree of freedom with the addition of one extra
component, expanding into an area and changing its
position in P- T space. Homogenization takes place
on a bubble point curve. The slopes of the isochores
are also somewhat different. More complex salt
solutions are usually assumed to behave in a similar
manner (though their PVT properties are mainly
poorly known).
Regardless
of the
composition
of
the
fluid,
the homogenization temperature can always be
measured and is always a minimum value for the
trapping temperature as long as two assumptions are
true:
1 the fluid was trapped as a single phase; and
2 fluid density has not changed since trapping.
The effect ofdissolved gases
Figure 3.8 shows the phase behaviour of a fluid
inclusion trapped at Tt , Pt that contains dissolved
CH4 . Nucleation of a bubble on cooling, and bubble
disappearance (homogenization) on heating, takes
place on the bubble point curve. This lies at much

higher pressures than two-phase curves in salt-
water systems. The difference between Tt and Th ,
the pressure correction, is therefore small and the
measured homogenization temperature is a good
estimate of the trapping conditions (Hanor, 1980).
Figure 3.8 is constructed for a CH4 solubility of
3200 ppm (0.2 molal), a reasonable value for a for-
mation water in a sedimentary basin. At room tem-
perature, the partial pressure of CH4 in the vapour
bubble is about 9 MPa. Laser Raman spectroscopy
is capable of identifying CH4 in fluid inclusions at
partial pressures as low as about 0.1 MPa, so it
ought to be easily detectable in our hypothetical
inclusion (see Section 3.5.2).
Petroleum fluid inclusions
Petroleums have two phase envelopes in P- T space,
bounded by bubble point and dew point curves (Fig.
3.9). Homogenization in petroleum fluid inclusions
usually occurs by vapour bubble disappearance along
the bubble point curve. Isochores for petroleums are
not as steep as those of aqueous fluids and, as a
consequence, the pressure correction tends to be
quite substantial, frequently many tens of degrees
Celsius. The homogenization temperatures of petro-

leum fluid inclusions therefore tend to be poor
estimates of the temperatures at which the petro-
leum became trapped so that petroleum inclusions
are far less useful than aqueous inclusions when it
comes to geothermometry.
3.3.4 Data collection - precision and accuracy
Microthermometry is carried out on a heating-
cooling microscope stage. Several designs are com-
mercially
available.
All permit cycling between
temperatures close to those of liquid Nz (which is
used in most as a coolant) and an upper limit of
several hundreds of degrees Celsius, at the same
time permitting microscopic observation in plane
polarized light. All stages need to be carefully
calibrated using ultra-pure compounds of known
melting point (MacDonald & Spooner, 1981)* or
synthetic fluid inclusions grown at known temperat-
ures from fluids of known composition.
*Details of how the measurements are made can be found
in Shepherd et al. (1985).
Measurements of each phase change are usually
presented as histograms in which the frequency
of measurement is plotted against a temperature
interval, usually 5 or 10ce for homogenization tem-
perature and 2 or SoC for ice final melting temperat-
ure. Histograms can be plotted either for a single or
several samples, but these should come from about
the same deptht . Figure 3.10 shows a typical sample
of homogenization temperature measurements from
quartz cement. How accurate and precise are these
data? The precision of the temperature measure-
ments is equivalent to their repeatability. Usually,
this is around ±O.l°C for an ice final melting point
and better than ± 0.5°C for a homogenization tem-
perature. The accuracy depends both on precision
and on the calibration of the stage. For our stage,
we have estimated the accuracy of the respective
measurements to be around ± 0.2 and ± 1°C. So
microthermometric measurements are both precise
t Data from samples from a wide range of depths should
not be lumped together as depth and Th are often cor·
related (Robinson et al., 1992b).

and accurate.
But,
what are
they precise
and
accurate measurements of? Not usually of the num-
ber that we want to know - trapping temperature
but of the temperature of a phase change which has
to be interpreted to provide trapping temperature.
The message is that effectively all the uncertainty
surrounding fluid inclusion data is contained in
the assumptions made in their interpretation. The
accuracy and precision of measurements like those
presented in Fig. 3.10 are so good that they can be
ignored. In other words, the data in Fig. 3.10 are
highly accurate measurements of a minimum value
for trapping of the inclusion fluids but their accuracy
as estimates of the actual trapping temperature is
unknown.
When dealing with fluid inclusions in diagenetic
minerals, it is extremely time consuming or even
impossible to collect a large number of measure-
ments simply because suitable inclusions are so
scarce. Figure 3.10 shows 11 measurements of Th
obtained from two samples. The mean is 115.7°C
and 2cr is 8.7°C. Do we need more data? The answer
depends on whether we feel that the data already
collected represent to an acceptable degree the
population of all fluid inclusions that share this
common origin. What is acceptable depends on
what the data are to be used for. The main applica-
tions in petroleum geology would be to estimate an
age for mineral growth from the mean and perhaps
its duration from the variance (as described by the
standard deviation). The uncertainties involved in
both procedures are likely to be large relative to any
changes in the mean and standard deviation of our
sample that might arise if more data were collected.
We would call it a day and go for a beer!
3.4 Microthermometry 11- interpretation
3.4.1 Introduction
As with all analytical methods, there are complica-
tions and difficulties involved in fluid inclusion
work. Some are really procedural and can be over-
come with a mixture of application, good fortune
and experience. In this category we would include,
for example, the small size and scarcity of fluid
inclusions in diagenetic minerals and the consequent
difficulty in generating adequate datasets. There
are however two uncertainties associated with inter-
pretation that are less easy to deal with. The first
is the extent to which inclusions have undergone
natural stretching or leakage before the sample is
collected. If they have, measured homogenization
temperatures will not reflect the original condi-
tions of trapping and may be almost impossible to
interpret in any geologically meaningful way. This is
because if an inclusion stretches or leaks, one of the
key assumptions of fluid inclusion interpretation -
constant density since trapping - will not hold. We
will consider this question in some detail because it
is fundamental to the use of fluid inclusion studies in
sedimentary geology. It is also a question that has
been dodged by many who use the technique. The
conclusion that we reach is that only fluid inclusions
in quartz can be relied upon to provide informa-
tion about mineral growth temperature (though
those in other minerals may under certain circum-
stances). The reliability of fluid inclusions in quartz
is widely but not universally accepted: Osborne
and Haszeldine (1993), for example, believe that
they routinely leak and break the constant density

assumption.
The
second
question concerns the
calculation of trapping temperature from homo-
genization temperature
-
making the pressure
correction. We will see that this process is fraught
with difficulty, raising the question as to whether it
should even be attempted.
3.4.2 Stretching and leakage - a terminal problem?
Why should inclusions stretch or leak?
In order to interpret information about trapping
temperature from fluid inclusions, it is necessary to
assume that the density of the fluid in each inclusion
cavity has remained constant since trapping. If
this assumption is not valid, homogenization tem-
peratures measured in the laboratory will bear no
systematic relationship to fluid trapping temperat-
ures and will be at very least extremely difficult to
interpret geologically. Under certain circumstances,
fluid
inclusions can undergo natural non-elastic
Fluid Inclusions 53
deformation: they may stretch or even burst open
('leak'). In the first case, the volume of the cavity
and therefore fluid density would change; in the
second, gain or loss of fluid to or from the inclusion
would again alter the density of that remaining in
the cavity. Either way, the critical assumption is
violated.
The diagenetic environment is unhappily one
of those in which the constant-volume assumption
tends not to hold (Robinson et al., 1992b). Indeed,
the increase in temperature followed by a sedi-
ment in a subsiding sedimentary basin promotes
stretching/leakage of fluid inclusions. Figure 3.11
helps to explain why. Consider an inclusion of den-
sity 0.90g.cm-3 trapped in a mineral cement in a
porous sediment at a pressure of 57 MPa (point T).
The P- T path followed by the fluid in the sediment
pores during burial is calculated assuming hydrostatic
pressure and a geothermal gradient of 30°C.km- l .
After 0.5 km offurther subsidence, the pore pressure

Experimental stretching offluid inclusions
One obvious way of trying to resolve the question
of whether stretching/leakage is a serious problem
is to try to simulate the process in the laboratory.
Experiments have been carried out on fluorite and
sphalerite (Bodnar & Bethke, 1984), barite (Ulrich
& Bodnar, 1988), calcite (Prezbindowski & Larese,
1987) and on quartz itself (Leroy, 1979; Binns &
Bodnar,
1986; Bodnar et al.,
1989; Sterner &
Bodnar, 1989). The studies involve determining
inclusion homogenization temperatures and then
repeating the measurements after heating by a par-
ticular increment above the initial value. The results
show that the amount of overheating required to
perature since depth and temperature are them-
selves correlated; Fig. 3.12). These correlations are
open to two interpretations. If the inclusions retain
information about mineral growth temperatures,
they must indicate geologically rapid (less than
about
10 Ma
ago),
late-diagenetic
periods
of
cementation that affect much of the formation at
about the same time (Robinson & Gluyas, 1992a).
The alternative explanation is that the correlation is
due to stretching or leakage and that homogeniza-
tion
temperatures
are
responding
to
increasing
degrees of overheating as a result of progressive
burial (Prezbindowski & Tapp, 1991).

1992). Plotted against depth sub-sea floor.
in the sedimp.nt will have increased to about 63 MPa.
The pressure in the inclusion, however, is con-
strained to follow a constant density isochore as
temperature increases. For aqueous fluids (though
not for petroleum), these isochores are steep rela-
tive to the P- T path followed by the fluid in the
pores. The result of even a small amount of heating
beyond the trapping temperature is therefore a large
differential pressure between inclusion and pore. In
the example in Fig. 3.11, just 15°C of overheating
(half a kilometre of further burial) leads to a dif-
ferential pressure of about 25 MPa. If this exceeds
the strength of the mineral, non-elastic deformation
of some kind will result. The inclusion fluid may
even re-equilibrate with that in the pores, reducing
its density (from 0.90 to 0.87 g.cm- 3 in the example).
The homogenization temperature that we would
measure for this inclusion (Th') would bear no sys-
tematic relationship to the trapping temperature, T.
It has now been demonstrated beyond reasonable
doubt that aqueous fluid inclusions in many minerals
generally do leak or stretch during diagenesis and
consequently
do
not
provide
reliable
informa-
tion about trapping temperatures (Burruss, 1987;
Prezbindowski & Tapp, 1991). This is true of calcite
(Comings
&
Cercone,
1986;
Goldstein,
1986;
Prezbindowski & Larese, 1987; Barker & Halley,
1988) and probably of all carbonates. It is also likely
to be true of other minerals with cleavages and/or
low mechanical strengths, such as sulphates and
feldspars. Below we will briefly consider the evi-
dence for and against stretching of fluid inclusions in
diagenetic minerals, paying particular attention to
quartz. We begin by describing patterns shown by
fluid inclusion data in mineral cements and explain
why they may be interpreted as indicating wholesale
stretching or leakage. We then review the experi-
mental
work on
stretching,
noting
its
possible
implications and limitations. The next section is
devoted to describing evidence from the rocks them-
selves. The comforting conclusion is that inclusions
in quartz probably do not generally stretch or leak.
Patterns ofinclusion data - evidence for stretching?
Homogenization

of
primary
fluid
inclusions in diagenetic minerals are very commonly
close to maximum burial temperatures (e.g. Jourdan
et al., 1987; Hogg, 1989; Walderhaug, 1990). In
cases where data have been gathered from the same
formation over a range of depths, there is a clear
correlation between homogenization temperature
and depth (and, of course, maximum burial tem-

(Bodnar et al., 1989; see Fig. 3.13). V is the inclu-
sion volume in cubic micrometres and Y is a shape
factor that varies from 0 for highly irregular inclu-
sions to 10 for spherical inclusions or those with a
negative crystal shape. For a spherical inclusion with
a diameter of 5 llm, equation 1 predicts that the
pressure required to induce decrepitation would be
induce stretching/leakage depends firstly on the
strength of the mineral; secondly on inclusion size;
and thirdly, on inclusion shape.
The most important factor is mineral strength. Of
the inclusions in barite, 42% stretched or burst open
(decrepitated) with < lOoe of overheating. Inclusions
in fluorite began to stretch with 20-30oe of over-
heating and after 80°C 90% had done so. Stretching
became significant for inclusions in sphalerite only
with overheating of 30-50oe and none recorded
temperatures greater than 25°C above the original
homogenization temperature. Stretching was more
common
than
leakage
(decrepitation)
in
these
minerals and was difficult or impossible to recognize
petrographically. The corresponding experiments
performed at 1 atmosphere confining pressure on
quartz are however more encouraging. They suggest
that < 10% of fluid inclusions in quartz will be
modified provided that the internal pressure is not
greater than about 200 MPa*. For an inclusion con-
taining pure water, this figure corresponds to about
200°C of overheating past the homogenization tem-
perature. For a salt solution, the amount of over-
heating needed would be even higher.
One of the most important conclusions to be
drawn from the experimental studies is that the
amount of differential pressure required to induce
non-elastic deformation depends on inclusion size
(and to a lesser extent on shape). In general, small
inclusions are more resistant to stretching than
large ones and equant inclusions more resistant than
irregular ones. Relationships of this kind have been
found for fluorite, barite, and also for quartz. There
are two alternative equations for quartz:

240 MPa; if the diameter were 3 J..lm, the pressure
would be 262 MPa. Equation 2 predicts correspond-
ing pressures of 216 and 268 MPa.
The experimental work provides then some con-
fidence
that differential pressures of the order
of 200 MPa (equivalent to overheating by more
than 200°C) are needed to cause wholesale natural
deformation of a population of fluid inclusions in
quartz cement. However, there is some doubt as to
whether these results can be extended to pressure-
temperature and time regimes characteristic of
diagenesis; whether for example, over geological
time, even relatively small differential pressures
might lead to inclusion volume changes.
Also,
deformation behaviour may differ under natural
conditions. In the experiments carried out at atmo-
spheric confining pressure,
inclusions in quartz
tended to respond to overheating by decrepitating.
In those performed at elevated confining pressures,
inclusions tended to stretch rather than decrepitate.
This is important because inclusions that have
decrepitated can probably be recognized and ex-
cluded from a dataset. Stretching cannot be detected
petrographically.
* The experiment was carried out at a confining pressure of
1 bar. The critical factor controlling stretching is probably
differential pressure between inclusion and pore rather
than absolute inclusion pressure.
Evidence for absence ofstretching

required to induce deformation. Small inclusions in
diagenetic minerals might therefore be expected to
retain low (unmodified) homogenization temperat-
ures better than large ones and the result should be
a correlation between Th and inclusion size in a
popUlation ofdeformed inclusions. The homogeniza-
tion
temperatures of fluid
inclusions
in
quartz
cement are not in our experience correlated with
inclusion size (Fig. 3.14). However, in some cases,
neither is the expected relationship displayed by
fluid inclusion data from calcites and dolomites
when there is independent evidence that stretching
or leakage has in fact occurred (Burruss, 1987). It
seems then that the lack of a clear correlation be-
tween homogenization temperature and size does not
demonstrate that the inclusions have not stretched.
Perhaps a more convincing line of evidence comes
from the internal consistency of fluid inclusion data.
The homogenization temperatures of primary fluid
inclusions in quartz cement in a single sample (or a
number of samples from a restricted range of depths
in a well) generally cluster tightly about a well-
defined mean (Robinson & Gluyas, 1992a). It seems
unlikely that a sample of inclusions that had been
stretched to an extent that should depend on size,
fluid composition and, probably, location within the
mineral host (proximity to dislocations, fractures,
etc.) would show such consistency. This pattern, so
characteristic of inclusions in quartz, certainly con-
trasts with the large ranges of Th often shown by

inclusions in diagenetic carbonate cements (Fig.
3.15; Visser, 1982; Goldstein, 1986). It is nonethe-
less conceivable that an internally consistent dataset
may not constitute good evidence against deforma-
tion. Experimental stretching of inclusions in calcite
by Prezbindowski and Larese (1987) did lead to
broadening of an
originally
tighter distribution
about a much higher mean temperature, but not by
amounts that could be easily identified in a natural
example. The histograms of Fig. 3.15a-c might then
represent samples of stretched inclusions that had
originally slightly tighter Th distributions, but quite
different (lower) means.
If homogenization temperatures obtained from
fluid inclusions are to be interpreted in terms of
mineral growth temperatures, they must be com-
patible with information from independent sources.
Illite cements, often found in sandstones cemented
also by quartz, can be dated radiometrically by the
K-Ar method. Their textural relationship to quartz
cement can frequently be established from SEM and
thin-section
petrography.
K-Ar dating of illite
cements has its own uncertainties (see Chapter 5),
but we have found that relative ages of quartz and
illite cement determined petrographically generally
are
in
agreement with estimated
absolute
ages
derived, in the case of illite, from careful K-Ar
dating, and in the case of quartz from fluid inclusion
data referred to a modelled burial history. This
suggests that the fluid inclusions have not stretched.
The last and possibly most persuasive line of
evidence is the preservation of temperature dif-
ferences
between
related
inclusion
populations.
While
it
is conceivable that different
inclusion
populations in a cement might all undergo stretching
and still retain homogenization temperature dis-
tributions suggestive of their separate origins, it
seems likely that stretching would smooth out or
obliterate original differences. In the absence of
stretching/leakage, different generations of inclu-
sions in a sample ought then to show different
homogenization
temperature
distributions.
In
a
sedimentary rock, those which can be shown by
textural relationships to have been trapped earliest
would usually be expected to exhibit the lowest
temperatures. It is often possible to recognize a
sequence of growth zones in quartz cements using
cathodoluminescence. In those cases where it has
proved possible to relate primary fluid inclusions to
a cement zone stratigraphy, the homogenization
temperature
distributions
are

nificantly different for inclusions from

general less saline. It seems unlikely that this detailed
record of changes in pore fluid composition and pro-
gressive burial would have survived had the in-
clusions undergone significant natural deformation.
Do petroleum inclusions stretch?
Petroleum isochores are much less steep on a
pressure-temperature diagram than are those of
water and salt solutions. This is the reason why the
homogenization temperatures of petroleum inclu-
sions tend to be much lower than their trapping
temperatures. It is also the reason why petroleum
inclusions are far less prone to leakage/stretching.
Because petroleum isochores are almost parallel to
the pressure-temperature path followed by the pore
fluid of a subsiding sediment (Fig. 3.9), a substantial
differential pressure between pore and inclusion is
not likely to develop, regardless of how much the
inclusions are heated beyond their homogenization
temperatures.
Summary
Although no single line of evidence may be regarded
as totally conclusive, we believe that taken as a
whole, the body of evidence, experimental and
geological, suggests that aqueous fluid inclusions in
diagenetic quartz cement do not generally stretch

and that they provide reliable information about the
conditions under which they were trapped. This is
probably true of other diagenetic minerals only in
exceptional circumstances. Aqueous inclusions in
calcite, barite, sphalerite and fluorite undoubtedly
stretch naturally with small amounts of overheating
and cannot be relied on to provide information
about mineral growth temperature. The same is
probably true of authigenic feldspars, other car-
bonate minerals and sulphates. Petroleum inclu-
sions are far less susceptible to stretching in any
mineral host, but for the same reason are poor
geothermometers.
3.4.3 Pressure corrections: can we and should we?
The pressure correction is the amount (in degrees
Celsius) that must be added to the measured homo-
genization temperature to obtain the trapping tem-
perature. In order to calculate it, we must be able to
determine both:
I the slope of the isochore; and
2 the trapping pressure, Pt , or an independent
P- T relationship (in order to fix the point on the
isochore).
There are two widely used approaches to calculat-
ing the slopes of isochores. The first involves measur-
ing the decrepitation temperature (Td ) at which the
fluid inclusion bursts open. The point Td is plotted
on a P- T diagram at a decrepitation pressure either
(as is more general) assumed to be a constant for the
particular mineral host, or calculated from an equa-
tion such as (1) or (2) above. This point must lie on
the isochore for the inclusion fluid, so the final step
is to join this point to the homogenization temperat-
ure and pressure with a straight line. The procedure,
illustrated in Fig. 3.17, defines the slope of the
isochore. This method is quite widely employed,
particularly by French and Russian scientists. How-
ever many, including ourselves, are highly suspicious
of it. The main reason is the uncertainty surrounding
the decrepitation pressure. It seems clear that there
is no single decrepitation pressure applicable to
inclusions of all sizes and shapes in a given mineral.
Equations like (1) and (2) predict quite different
values and are in any case regression lines fitted to
data that show considerable scatter (see Fig. 3.13).
The second method ofdetermining isochore slopes
is however just as fraught because it requires two
items of information that, certainly in the case
of fluid inclusions
in sedimentary samples,
are
extremely difficult
or impossible
to determine.

These are:
I a quantitative chemical analysis of the inclusion
fluid; and
2 the PVT properties of that chemical system.
Virtually the only case when PVT properties may be
accurately known is if the inclusion fluids are petro-
leum. PVT properties are regularly determined by
petroleum engineers by recombining oil and gas
collected from the separator tank at the well head.
Experimental PVT determination is usually pre-
ferred although equations of state are also used. In
order to co-opt these PVT properties for use with a
particular set of fluid inclusions, it is necessary to
make an assumption: that the oil in the reservoir and
that in the inclusions are chemically identical. This
can be sometimes be checked by certain analytical
methods (described below) but is unlikely in general
to be strictly true. Fortunately many of the so-called
'black oils' have isochores with rather similar slopes,
so the error involved in making the assumption may
not be large.
Even if we were able to muster enough courage to
calculate an isochore, we would still be faced with
the problem of locating the trapping temperature
along that line, either by obtaining an independ-
ent estimate of trapping pressure, or a pressure-
temperature equation. The first is something of a
no-hoper as there are no reliable geobarometers

that can be applied to sedimentary rocks. There are
however at least two ways of obtaining an independ-
ent
pressure-temperature
relationship.
One
involves a simple calculation for a normally (hydro-
statically) pressured pore fluid in a sedimentary
basin. Though easy to do, this involves making
assumptions about palaeo-thermal gradients and
pressure regimes that may well be incorrect. The
second method is known as that of crossed isochores.
If two immiscible fluids are trapped simultaneously,
the trapping conditions of both must lie where the
isochores for the two fluids cross. This phenomenon
is not uncommon: oil and water are immiscible
and often seem to be trapped together in growing
diagenetic cements. The two examples that we
will consider in a moment both use the method of
crossed isochores.
This discussion ought to convince the reader that
the process of determining trapping temperatures
from homogenization temperatures (summarized in
Fig. 3.18) involves numerous assumptions that are
difficult to evaluate. Our approach is not even to try
unless circumstances are unusually favourable and
to accept homogenization temperatures for what
they are: highly accurate minimum values for trap-
ping temperatures.
3.4.4 Example 1: calcite filled fractures, Little Knife
Field, North Dakota
This example involves the interpretation of a set of
fluid inclusion data from fracture filling calcite in
the Little Knife Field, North Dakota (Narr &
Burruss, 1984). It provides a good illustration of the
kinds of problem that we now know must be faced
when interpreting fluid inclusion data in diagenetic
minerals, problems which are still routinely glossed
over in published case histories.
Two main groups of inclusions were identified:
one containing liquid water plus vapour and one
with liquid petroleum plus vapour. A few inclusions
contained all
three phases.
Aqueous inclusions
homogenized at temperatures between 102 (one at
76) and 141°C, though the authors believed (for
reasons that were not specified) that those numbers
in excess of 126°C were spurious (Fig. 3.19). All
but one of the petroleum inclusions homogenized
between 90 and 106°C. Most solid melting temperat-
ures in the aqueous inclusions ranged from - 3
to -5°C. The authors thought that the solid was
probably hydrohalite rather than ice, so estimated
the salinity of the inclusion fluid to be around 25 eq.
wt% NaCI. The bottom hole temperature was 121°C

and the maximum likely temperature was estimated
at about 132°C (about 300 m of sediments had been
eroded).
To the diligent reader who has struggled through
to this point of the chapter, two features of the
aqueous inclusion data should set alarm bells ring-
ing. Firstly, the homogenization temperatures show
a considerable scatter with some values well in
excess of the maximum temperature to which the
rocks had probably been subjected. Secondly, the
inclusions are in calcite. These two together suggest
to us that the inclusions have probably stretched or
leaked. If this has happened, they are useless for
estimating the temperature of calcite growth in the
fractures. Leaving aside the question of stretching,
let us look at how the data were interpreted. The
authors believed that petroleum and aqueous inclu-
sions were trapped together and so used the method
of crossed isochores to estimate trapping P and T
from
homogenization
temperatures
(Fig.
3.20).
Isochores were obtained for petroleum inclusions by
assuming that they had the same PVT properties
of Little Knife crude (which were known). The
aqueous inclusions were assumed to be NaCI brines
so that isochores could be calculated from PVT data
available in the literature. The parallelogram formed
by the intersection of the two sets of isochores is the
range of pressures and temperatures within which all
inclusions should have been trapped. The range of
trapping P and T suggested by this interpretation is

mainly well in excess of the likely maximum P and
T experienced by the reservoir and the authors
realized that this posed problems. They believed
that the most likely explanation was that the aqueous
inclusions contained small amounts of CH4 (and
possibly HzS) that were difficult to detect, pointing
to one measurement of solid melting above O°C
which might have been a CH4 clathrate. If the
aqueous inclusions did contain CH4, their homo-
genization temperatures would be very close to the
true trapping conditions and the embarrassing need
to suggest that the reservoir had experienced tem-
peratures as high as about 170°C would disappear.
We would make two points about this interpreta-
tion. Firstly, though it seems and probably is quite
reasonable, there is another. It is also possible to
take the crossing isochores at face value, as indicat-
ing a period during which hot water flowed through
the reservoir, raising temperatures as high as 170°C.
The question is not without significance: petroleum
geologists would certainly want to know if temperat-
ures had been so high, as this would have important
implications for the maturity of petroleum source
rocks. This brings us on to the second point. In
a real world where there is always considerable
uncertainty about the composition of fluid inclu-
sions, calculating an accurate pressure correction
and choosing between competing interpretations
such as these will not usually be possible.

3.4.5 Example 2: mineral cementation, offshore
Angola
Walgenwitz et al. (1990) describe fluid inclusion data
from diagenetic feldspar and anhydrite (with a
couple of measurements from dolomite and one
from quartz) from several formations from offshore
Angola. The data come from a wide range of depths
and are sensibly presented not as histograms, but as
plots of Th against depth (Fig. 3.21). Both aqueous
and petroleum inclusions were found; the homo-
genization temperatures of the aqueous inclusions
are close to current temperatures at the respective
sample depths. Seismic sections suggest that the
area has not been recently uplifted so that current
burial is a maximum.
In this study, the approach the authors adopted to
interpreting their data was somewhat different from
that of Narr and Burruss (Fig. 3.22). They deter-
mined isochore slopes for
petroleum inclusions
using the decrepitation temperature (assuming for
example that this occurred at a constant 60 MPa in
feldspar). Well aware of the influence of dissolved
CH4 on water PVT properties, they searched for
it using laser Raman spectroscopy. Unhappily, it
was not possible to prove or disprove its presence
because fluorescence of the host minerals masked
any Raman signal from CH4 that might have been
present. They then resorted to a highly indirect
method based on decrepitation temperatures to infer
that the inclusions contained no CH4. Finally, hav-
ing inferred the presence of CaClz brines in the
aqueous inclusions, the authors assumed that these
would have the PVT properties of NaCI solutions
and calculated isochore slopes from the published
PVT data. The final step was to find where petro-
leum and aqueous inclusion isochores intersected -
the interpreted trapping temperatures and pressures.
Walgenwitz et al. ended up with the same problem
as Narr and Burruss. Interpreted trapping temperat-
ures were as much as 40°C higher than present-
day temperatures (which had been thought to be
maximum values for the area). Their approach to
this difficulty was, however, quite different: they
believed their interpretation and attempted to find a
geological explanation for the high temperatures.
They ended up by concluding that thermal gradients
were substantially greater in the Miocene, although
such a 'thermal event' would not be predicted by any
of the models for the thermal evolution of a passive
continental margin.
The preferred interpretation suffers from the
Fluid Inclusions 63
usual two difficulties. Firstly, all the data come
from minerals with low mechanical strengths, in
which inclusions would be expected to stretch.
Homogenization temperatures of primary inclusions
would not then provide any information about
mineral growth. Secondly, even if stretching were
not a concern, so many assumptions are involved in
calculating a pressure correction that the ultimate
conclusion -
that there has been an important
Miocene thermal event - must, we feel, be regarded
with scepticism. In our view it would be preferable
to accept that homogenization temperatures of fluid
inclusions that have not stretched (if these can
be identified) are minimum estimates of trapping
temperatures and that further interpretation is not
possible.
3.5 Non-destructive analysis
of individual inclusions
3.5.1 Introduction
Look back to the sandstone sample illustrated in
Fig. 3.2. Supposing by crushing a few grams of rock
we obtained a bulk sample of the inclusion fluids and
analysed it. What would it represent and how would
we be able to interpret it? The sample would contain
fluids from inclusions trapped in (now clastic) quartz
crystals during crystallization of perhaps several
igneous intrusions of unknown age or location in
the sedimentary provenance area; possibly some
secondary fluid inclusions trapped as the intrusions
cooled; and small numbers of inclusions, possibly of
several distinct origins, trapped during sediment
diagenesis. An analysis of a mixture of these would
plainly be meaningless. This problem - the presence
of multiple inclusion generations -
is common to
most sedimentary (especially clastic)
rocks and
makes any analytical method that can be applied to
selected individual inclusions particularly attractive.
At present, all such methods are non-destructive.
Microthermometry
may itself be considered as
one; indeed, the most important of these. Three
spectroscopic methods have also been applied with
varying success to fluid inclusions in diagenetic
minerals. The application of laser Raman spectro-
scopy (LRS) to fluid inclusion analysis has a success-
ful history dating back to the early 1970s, although
there have been relatively few studies of sediment-
ary samples. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy has only been tried on fluid inclusions
relatively recently and shows some promise. Though

64 Chapter 3
both spectroscopic methods are based on molecular
vibrations, LRS and FfIR spectroscopy are com-
plementary because they differ in mechanism. LRS
depends on scattering: an incident photon perturbs a
molecule causing it to undergo a particular trans-
ition or rotation. FfIR spectroscopy relies on
absorption of the incident radiation. The use of UV
fluorescence to provide quantitative information
about oil composition is in its infancy but the method
is extremely useful in a qualitative sense. In this part
of the chapter, we will look at the capabilities and
potential of each of these methods to see what
information we may reasonably expect to obtain
about the chemistry of individual fluid inclusions in
sedimentary rocks.
3.5.2 Laser Raman spectroscopy
When any substance is excited by a source of mono-
chromatic electromagnetic radiation, the radiation
may be scattered in three ways:
1 Rayleigh
scattering.
Elastic
scattering of the
incident radiation without a change in energy (or,
therefore, in wavelength*).
2 Fluorescence.
Complete
absorption
and
re-
emission of radiation at lower energy (with an in-
crease in wavelength).
3 Raman scattering. Inelastic scattering (not absorp-
tion) by covalent bonds with a shift in wavelength
that is characteristic of the bond. The effect is several
orders of magnitude weaker than Rayleigh scatter-
ing or fluorescence, even for the strongest Raman
scatterers.
Raman shifts, the basis of Raman spectroscopy,
are usually sharp spectral features because they cor-
respond to the energies of particular vibrational or
rotational transitions of the scattering molecule. In
the microscope-based version of the technique, a
monochromatic visible light laser is introduced into
a modified optical microscope and focused by a high
magnification glass objective lens onto a sample
which sits on the microscope stage. The Raman
signal is collected simultaneously through the same
objective and analysed by a spectrometer. Spectra
are traditionally plotted as intensity against the shift
from the excitation wavenumber (~v)t.
The same doubly polished thin-sections used for
microthermometry and petrographic study are also

quency which is why the sky is blue.

ideal for LRS. The only requirements of the host
mineral are that it should be transparent to the laser
and to the Raman signal, and that it should not
fluoresce (both quartz and calcite sometimes do).
The laser can be focused down to a spot size of
about 31lm, close to the theoretical
maximum
resolution of about O.71lm (limited by the wave-
length of the laser light). The signal, and thus ana-
lytical information, comes from an irradiated volume
whose exact size cannot be determined exactly for
fluid inclusions, but which is certainly of the order of
only a few cubic micrometres. This means that
analyses can be obtained from individual phases -
liquid, vapour and solid - within even very small
fluid inclusions. In fact, LRS has such extraordinary
spatial resolution that it is not at all good for analys-
ing bulk inclusion compositions, because although it
is possible to defocus the beam to irradiate a larger
volume, this reduces the power of the excitation and
thus the Raman signal strength. The technique is
generally non-destructive, though we have known
inclusions to introduce an element of excitement by
exploding unpredictably under the laser.
What then can be detected using LRS? The Raman
effect relies on scattering by covalent bonds so there
is no response from ionic species. Equally, some
covalently bonded compounds are such poor Raman
scatterers that they are very difficult to detect. For
example, water is a poor Raman scatterer with an
unusually broad Raman spectrum which can make it
difficult to detect above a noisy background. None-
theless, a large number of species of geological
importance contain bonds that are reasonable or
strong Raman scatterers. These include virtually all
S-bearing compounds (H2S, SO/-, S02, So, etc.),
CH4 , CO2, CO, N2 and 02' C-H, C-C, C=C and
C=C bonds can all be detected and distinguished,
but analysis of petroleum by LRS is usually im-
possible because the laser tends to cause strong
fluorescence which totally obscures the much weaker
Raman signal.
Figure 3.23 shows Raman spectra from one of the
fluid inclusions that we discussed in Section 3.3.2
(illustrated in Fig. 3.1c). On cooling, the liquid in
these inclusions froze to a solid that melted at
around -90°C, slightly lower than the triple point of
H2S. LRS confirmed that the inclusions contain a
mixture of H2S and CH4• Small dark specks in
some of the inclusions were identified as elemental
sulphur. The main use for LRS in fluid inclusion
analysis has, just as in this example, been as a tool
for the qualitative identification of volatiles. In

their strengths as Raman scatterers) and the areas of
their Raman peaks. However, even this process is
not without problems. Raman scattering cross sec-
tions are known only for low density fluids; are not
appropriate to the spectrum collection geometry of
the equipment used in microanalysis; and are in any
case disputed. Also, if peak intensities are low,
there may be a significant error involved in deter-
mining their areas. The precision of an analysis of
this type is equivalent to the ability of the equipment
to reproduce relative peak areas. This depends on
the counting statistics and the background and can
often be very high, say a few relative per cent.
Accuracy however is determined both by precision
and by uncertainty surrounding the true value of the
scattering cross sections, and is far from easy to
quantify. Wopenka and Pasteris (1986) estimated
the accuracy of a LRS analysis of a CO2 + CH4
inclusion by assuming that the tabulated values for
Raman cross sections (with a quoted uncertainty of
± 10%) were applicable. The results of the analysis
were 14.8 ± 2.0mol% CH4 (14 relative %) and 85.2
± 2.0 mol% CO2 (2.3 relative %). Even making this
(incorrect) assumption, the estimated accuracy of
± 2 mol% was dominated by the uncertainty in the
values of Raman cross sections. One way of trying to
overcome the problem of uncertain Raman cross
sections is to produce standards (although these are
applicable to only one machine). Pasteris et al.
(1988) used gas-filled capillaries at pressures of 1.0-
1.5 MPa to estimate the minimum concentrations of
several volatiles of geological interest that their
machine was capable of detecting. Detection limits,
determined as partial pressures, varied from 0.05
to O.15MPa.
By far the most important application of LRS to
fluid inclusion analysis has been this type of qualita-
tive
to
semi-quantitative analysis of covalently
bonded volatiles. The method has however been
used in some subtly different ways. Though ionic
species themselves produce no Raman signal, they
can sometimes be detected in a fluid inclusion by
means of a clever trick. If a heating-cooling stage is
fitted to the LRS microscope, the inclusion can be
frozen. Many of the solids formed in concentrated
salt solutions - hydrohalite for example - will pro-
duce a characteristic Raman spectrum (Dubessy
et al., 1982). Clathrates can be identified in the same
way. The position of Raman peaks is also sensitive
to pressure. This has been calibrated for CH4 so that
the method can be used to estimate the pressure
in inclusions (Fabre & Couty, 1986). It is even

fact, LRS cannot produce a quantitative chemical
analysis from this type of sample. This is because
the strength of the Raman signal reaching the
spectrometer is dependent not only on the number
of moles of sample being irradiated, but also on
several factors related to sample geometry and
instrumentation that are impossible to determine.
However, it is possible to ratio out these indeter-
minate factors and calculate the relative amounts of
chemical components in the phase being analysed
(Wopenka & Pasteris, 1986; Pasteris et al., 1988).
The ratio of two components, expressed as mole
fraction or partial pressure, can be calculated from
their Raman scattering cross sections (which describe

thermometry from the shape of the water Raman
peak (Mernagh & Wilde, 1989)!
3.5.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
The bonds of molecules are continually vibrating
due to interactions with molecules in the immediate
environment. If the bonds are excited by infrared
radiation, the amplitudes of the vibrations will
increase, subsequently decreasing again as energy
is
lost
to
surrounding molecules.
Only
certain
(quantized)
increases in vibrational
energy
are
possible and these constitute a characteristic absorp-
tion spectrum. The more bonds that are excited,
the more energy is absorbed, so the strength of
the spectrum depends on concentration. For most
molecules, there are several possible types of vibra-
tion (vibrational modes). These are based either on
stretching, which may be asymmetric or symmetric,
and bending, which may take place in several poss-
ible planes and directions. As a consequence, infra-
red absorption spectra of even simple substances
can be complicated, with many peaks attributable
to different vibrational modes (Brown et al., 1988).
Only asymmetric vibrations which produce a fluct-
uating electrical dipole will absorb infrared and
produce characteristic spectra.
In FTIR spectroscopy, a polychromatic infrared
source (I-. typically from 1.1 to 200 ~m) is focused
onto a sample using cassegrainian (mirror) object-
ives. These can be exchanged for glass objectives
so that samples can be located using visible light.
The infrared beam emerging from the objectives is
still several hundreds of micrometres across and so
has to be stopped down by mechanical apertures.
The beam passes through the sample to a detector
located beneath it which scans the range 1.8-14 ~m
(Wopenka et al., 1990). FTIR spectroscopy pro-
duces an analysis of everything along the beam path,
including the atmosphere (C02 and H20
absorb
infrared!), as well as the mineral host. The problem

tional groups (groups of compounds characterized
by bond types such as C-H, C=H, C=O, etc.) can
be identified from their infrared spectra (Fig. 3.25).
Any quantitative (or perhaps more plausibly, semi-
quantitative) analysis would therefore take the form
of ratios of functional groups and would not be
directly comparable to an oil analysis made by a
standard technique such as gas chromatography.
FTIR spectroscopy is
not capable of detecting
individual compounds in oil.
Like LRS, FTIR spectroscopy is of value prin-
cipally as a method for the identification of species
in fluid inclusions. Quantitative analysis depends
on knowing relative peak areas and infrared absorp-
tivities (analogous to Raman scattering cross sec-
tions) and does not appear to have been much
attempted on fluid inclusions. One problem is that
the absorptivities are quite uncertain and known
to vary with density. It is hard to quantify pre-
cision,
accuracy and
detection limits.
Precision
(reproducibility) is usuaJly excellent provided that
the sample does not present difficulties, but accuracy
is determined largely by the uncertainty surrounding
the appropriate absorptivity. Detection limits for
any compound will vary with machine, analytical
conditions and the nature of the sample.
must be solved by collecting a background spectrum
from a part of the mineral with no inclusions, using
identical operating conditions.
Though doubly polished thin-sections are good
preparations for FTIR spectroscopy, the nature of
the sample is more critical than is usuaJly the case
with LRS. The mineral host clearly should be as
far as possible transparent over the entire infrared
range, but of the common diagenetic minerals, only
halite is (Fig. 3.24). Quartz has strong absorption
bands at wavenumbers less than about 2000cm- 1
but is quite transparent at higher wavenumbers and
calcite has absorption bands that overlap those of
some petroleum components. Furthermore, as it
passes through the polished section, the infrared
beam must pass only through the fluid inclusion
being
analysed.
Samples with
a
high
inclusion
density will be unsuitable (unless these are all of
one generation so that spectral contamination is
acceptable). Spatial resolution - controJled by clos-
ing the aperture -
is much poorer than in LRS
because of the longer wavelength of the infrared
excitation source. If the aperture is narrower than
about 20 x 20 Jlm, the beam is diffracted so that
some photons hit the surroundings and contaminate
the spectrum. This means that the smaJlest inclusion
that can be analysed is about 10 x 20 Jlm, larger than
most fluid inclusions in sedimentary rocks. Because
of the relatively poor spatial resolution and because
the beam passes through the sample, FTIR spectro-
scopy is better at analysing entire inclusions than
individual phases.
Like LRS, FTIR spectroscopy does not respond
to ionic substances or even all those with covalent
bonds. Simple diatomic molecules like Hz, Oz, Nz
vibrate symmetrically and so cannot be detected
by the method. Even some molecules that absorb
infrared do so very weakly and are difficult to detect
(for example, HzS). As with LRS, however, bonds
in many species of geological interest -
including
water, COz and CH4 - are readily detected by FTIR
spectroscopy. In suitable (large) inclusions, FTIR
spectroscopy is better than LRS for detecting COz
but not as good for detecting CH4 • It is also better
for detecting water because of the low intensity of
the water Raman peak (Vry et al., 1987). The
method has in particular considerable potential for
the analysis of petroleum in fluid inclusions (Barres
et al., 1987; O'Grady et al., 1989; Guilhaumou et al.,
1990a; Moser et al., 1990; Rankin et al., 1990). Oil

Figure 3.27 shows fluorescence spectra of oils from
the UK North Sea (all sourced from the Kimmeridge
Clay Formation), arranged in order of API gravity*.
The spectra of the lighter and more mature oils
(higher API gravity) are clearly weighted towards
the blue end of the spectrum. The difficulty in using
relationships of this kind is partly one of identifying
parameters which can be used to measure the shape
changes of the spectra, and can then be correlated
with maturity (for an attempt, see Guilhaumou et
al., 1990b).
3.6.1 Introduction
We have just spent a fair amount of effort thinking
about microspectroscopic analytical methods for a
good reason: the difficulty of extracting enough fluid
from one generation of fluid inclusions to make
a meaningful bulk chemical analysis possible. For
some problems, for example the bulk analysis of
aqueous inclusions in quartz cements, we believe the
position to be hopeless: bulk analysis will never be
possible and microspectroscopy of some kind offers
the only way forward. There are nonetheless some
cases where extraction of sufficient fluid for analysis
is possible and one of these is of great interest - the
analysis of petroleum trapped in fluid inclusions.
There are two reasons for this. One is that petroleum
fluid inclusions are often surprisingly abundant; and
the second is that a mineralogically and texturally
complex rock usually contains several generations of
aqueous inclusions, but often only one set contain-
ing petroleum. Crushing a bulk rock sample will
therefore liberate petroleum from only the one
inclusion generation.
In this section, we will look first at how to get the
petroleum out of the inclusions, and then at how the
sample of fluid can be analysed. The information
available includes the following.
1 Nature of source rock: is its kerogen derived from
land plants or marine algae?
2 Maturity: at what temperature was the petroleum
generated from the source rock?
3 PVT relationships (for calculation of isochores):
* API gravity = (141500/density at 60°F in kg.m- 3)
-
131.5; denser oils have lower API gravity.

mainly for simple identification and classification of
petroleum fluid inclusions in doubly polished thin-
sections and most studies report inclusion groups
simply as 'blue' or 'green' or even 'white' fluores-
cing. Nonetheless, there is more information to
be obtained. If a spectrometer is attached to the
microscope (commercial equipment is available),
fluorescence spectra can be easily collected from
even very small individual fluid inclusions in a matter
of seconds. Figure 3.26 shows UYF spectra for
petroleum inclusions identified as blue- and green-
fluorescing. The spectra are quite different, though
the main peaks occur at the same wavelengths,
probably because

is dominated by
a relatively small number of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. It proved possible to analyse these

3.6.2 Isolation of a fluid sample
The key step in analysis of a bulk sample of petro-
leum is its extraction from the fluid inclusions with-
out modifying it in any way. The rock sample must
first be coarsely crushed to about the size of its
component crystals or grains, and then thoroughly
oxidized or solvent-extracted. This step must remove
all bitumen stains and other extraneous organic
material. Next, the petroleum has to be removed
from the inclusions. There are two ways of doing
this, decrepitation and crushing, and both have
their
advantages,
disadvantages
and
adherents.
Decrepitation involves heating the sample until the
inclusions burst open. This tends to require heating
to several hundreds of degrees which may thermally
alter petroleum and also produce other volatiles not
present in the original inclusions. Crushing is there-
fore the preferred method for liberating petroleum.
Several crushers have been described in the liter-
ature (e.g. Andrawes et al., 1984). The crushing

70 Chapter 3
needs to be as gentle as possible or there may be
substantial adsorption of some components of the
petroleum onto newly created mineral surface (this
can be further minimized by heating the crusher to
around 100°C). Fluid is usually released into an inert
carrier gas and trapped by liquid nitrogen prior to
analysis.
3.6.3 Gas chromatography
All
chromatographic
techniques
rely
on
parti-
tion of the mixture to be separated -
in this case
petroleum -
between a stationary and a mobile
phase. In gas chromatography (GC), the stationary
phase is a silicone gum and the mobile phase a
helium carrier gas. The petroleum + carrier gas
mixture is injected into a column, a capillary lined
with the gum. As the mixture travels through the
column, molecules partition between gum and gas.
The lighter ones spend more time in the gas and
take less time to reach the end of the column and
detector. To get the heaviest molecules through the
column, its temperature is progressively raised.
The components of the petroleum are detected as
they emerge from the column by a flame ionization
detector.
Gas chromatograms are plots of intensity (so that
peak height is proportional to concentration) against
elution time (the time taken for a component to
pass through the column). They record the major
components of a petroleum from which PVT prop-
erties can be calculated and can be used to identify
alteration (such as biodegradation and water wash-
ing; Horsfield & McLimans, 1984). They also pro-
vide limited information about source and maturity.
For example, the pristane/phytane ratio can be
calculated from a gas chromatogram by simply ratio-
ing the height of the respective peaks. Some features
of the shape of the gas chromatogram, relative
proportions of light and heavy (waxy) hydrocarbons,
even-odd
preference
in
straight-chain
alkanes,
etc., are also characteristic of both source and
maturity. A word of warning here however. Gas
chromatograms of 'oils' are generally of petroleum
from which low boiling point (usually <200°C)
hydrocarbons and
also
asphaltenes* have
been
* Asphaltenes are the largest most polar components of an
oil and are defined as those which are soluble in a polar
solvent (dichloromethane) but insoluble in a non-polar
solvent (hexane or heptane). In practice, they too are now
usually separated by liquid chromatography.

and aromatic fractions by liquid chromatography.
Alkane gas chromatograms are the most widely
used. In contrast, GC analyses of fluid inclusions
incorporate everything that was in the inclusion that
the crushing process was able to release. The shapes
of the gas chromatograms of the two cannot there-
fore be easily compared.

Elution time (minutes)
Application of GCMS to petroleum fluid inclu-
sions is relatively straightforward. Biomarkers are
not volatile, so after coarse crushing and thorough
cleaning, the rock sample can simply be crushed in a
solvent. If possible, liquid chromatography should
be used to separate alkanes from aromatics, or
signals from the biomarkers being sought may suffer
from interference. We have found this to be possible
even with minute amounts of fluid. Figure 3.29
shows two GCMS 'fragmentograms' from the same
groups of petroleum fluid inclusions whose gas
chromatograms were illustrated in Fig. 3.28: m/z =
191 represents a characteristic fragment of hopanes,
another group of biomarkers useful for maturity
determination. Only a few examples of the use of
this method have been reported in the literature
(e.g. Etminan & Hoffman, 1989).

3.6.4 Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
The amount of information that GC can provide
about the source and maturity of an oil is rather
limited. This is because the most informative mo-
lecules are present in very small quantities which
are hard both to resolve and to identify on a gas
chromatogram.
These
molecules
are
known
as
biomarkers (or colloquially,
'molecular fossils').
They are those that are clearly derived from specific
products of biosynthesis, usually on the basis of
the form of their carbon skeletons. For example,
steranes, extremely common in oils (though present
in small quantities), are derived from sterols in algae
(Mackenzie et al., 1982). Some biomarker ratios
change with maturity due to changes in the propor-
tion of particular isomers (isomerization), increase
in the proportion of aromatic bonds (aromatization)
or thermal cracking. When calibrated, the extent of
these reactions can be used to measure maturity
(Mackenzie & McKenzie, 1983).
Biomarkers are analysed by coupling a GC with a
mass spectrometer (MS). As compounds emerge
from the GC column, they are fragmented and
ionized by collision with electrons and the ions are
swept into the mass spectrometer for analysis. Each
group of compounds tends to produce fragment ions
with characteristic mass/charge (m/z) ratios. A ratio
of interest is monitored as a function of elution
time in the GC column. For example, steranes, a
group ofcompounds that provide important maturity
information, produce a characteristic fragment with
m/z = 217. On a GeMS plot of intensity against
elution time for m/z = 217, different steranes can be
identified from their elution time and their relative
quantities determined by reading off peak heights.

4.1 Introduction
Isotopes are atoms whose nuclei contain the same
number of protons but a different number of neut-
rons. Most of the 1500 or so naturally occurring
isotopes are unstable and undergo radioactive decay
to other isotopes. A subset of isotopes, however,
is not radioactive, at least within our ability to
measure decay times. These are the stable isotopes
and are the subject of this chapter. The science of
stable isotope geochemistry is based on the fact that
isotopes of the same element have slightly dif-
ferent
thermodynamic
and
physical
properties
(Urey, 1947). As a consequence, their behaviour
in chemical and physical reactions is slightly dif-
ferent. Isotopes therefore become separated, or
fractionated, when they, or compounds which con-
tain them, participate in chemical reactions or
undergo a change of state. The resulting changes in
relative isotopic abundances are often measurable
and provide important insights into many geo-
chemical processes.
There are several excellent reasons why most
stable isotope geochemistry has been performed
on the light elements, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen and sulphur. Firstly, these elements con-
tain at least two stable isotopes in relatively high
abundance, facilitating their accurate measurement
(Table 4.1). Secondly, the amount of fractionation
in a reaction is a function of the relative mass dif-
ference between isotopes, so that variations in
isotope ratios are greatest for the light elements
(and are thus easiest to measure). Thirdly and
fortunately, these elements are major components
of geological and biological systems, and participate
in most geochemical reactions.
A list of the general applications of stable isotopes
to problems of petroleum geology is given in Table
4.2. The applications are of two general types:
information can be obtained about the source of an
element in a mineral or fluid, and also the conditions
(temperature, water composition) under which a
mineral precipitated. Whilst this information has
some intrinsic importance, the power of stable iso-
topes as a problem-solving tool is greatly enhanced

paying particular attention to the general problems
of data interpretation and to describe some applica-
tions of different isotopic systems to petroleum
geology.
4.2 Principles
4.2.1 Terminology
From an analytical standpoint, it is difficult to deter-
mine the rather restricted variations which occur
in the absolute concentrations of a given isotope.
Stable isotope abundances are therefore measured
as differences in the isotope ratios of two substances.
Correspondingly, stable isotope data are reported
using the 8, or del notation, in which the isotope
ratio of a sample is expressed in terms of its devia-
tion, in parts per thousand (%0, or per mille), from the
same ratio in an internationally accepted standard:
8A = {[RA - RSTND]/RsTND} .103
(1)
where RA is the ratio of the heavy isotope to the
light isotope for phase A (D/H, l3C/l2c, 180/160,
34S;32S) and RSTND is the same ratio for a stand-
ard material. For example, a 8180 value of +150/00
indicates that the sample is enriched in
180
by
15 parts per thousand relative to the standard, and
a 8D value of - 500/00 shows that the sample is
depleted in D by 50 parts per thousand relative to
the standard.
Although individual laboratories use their own
internal standards against which the isotope ratio
of a sample is measured, all isotope ratios are even-
tually reported against an international standard.
These are listed in Table 4.3 and by definition,
have del values of 0%0. Although V-SMOW is the
accepted oxygen standard, 8180 values of carbonates
are often reported relative to the oxygen in PDB*,
the carbon standard. The equations for converting
between the PDB and SMOW scales are given in
Table 4.3.
* POB is the acronym for the Pee Dee belemnite, a refer-
ence standard material which has long been exhausted.
All other standards are ultimately calibrated back to this
material.

The stable isotope fractionation factor between
two phases, A and B, is defined as:
The fractionation factor is related to the 8 values of
the two phases as follows:

where Rand P are reactants and products contain-
ing, for example,
12C and l3C. The ratio of the
isotopic rate constants k12 and kl3 is called the
kinetic fractionation factor and is usually> 1. Take,
for example, the bacterially mediated reduction of
CO2 to CH4• If k121k13 = 1.05, then CH4 will be
chemical bonds vary slightly with the mass of the
isotope. In general, the light isotope forms weaker
bonds than the heavier isotope. This gives rise to the
three types of isotope fractionation seen in natural
systems:
1 kinetic isotope effects, which arise because the
lighter isotope reacts more rapidly than the heavier
isotope;
2 equilibrium isotope effects, which are controlled
by the differing thermodynamic properties of each
isotope; and
3 vital or biological isotope effects, observed in
certain organisms which produce mineral skeletons
which are out of isotopic equilibrium with the water
from which they form.
Kinetic isotope effects are important in unidirec-
tional reactions which do not proceed to comple-
tion. Examples of reactions which involve a kinetic
isotope effect include the bacterial reduction of
sulphate and
many reactions involving reduced
organic carbon. In general, one can describe the
isotopic competition as two reactions which proceed
at differing rates thus:

ical and physical processes because the strengths of
It is also useful to introduce another term, ~, as the
isotopic difference between two phases:
This in turn can be related to U through a math-
ematical approximation. Manipulating equations (1)

This equation is useful because it means that, assum-
ing that phases A and B formed in equilibrium, we
can approximate
UA-B by simply subtracting the
measured isotopic compositions of the phases. The
approximation is

about 500/00 lighter (Le. depleted in l3C) than pre-
cursor CO2, An important corollary of this is that
residual CO2 will be correspondingly enriched in
l3C. If the reservoir of CO2 is not replenished (i.e.
a closed system), continued reduction will result
in CO2 and CH4 which both become increasingly
enriched in 13C (Fig. 4.1). This is known as the
reservoir effect
(nothing to do with petroleum
reservoirs) and can be described mathematically by
the Rayleigh distillation equations. In our example,
CH4 produced at a given time will always be 50%0
lighter than the remaining CO2 reservoir, but the
isotopic composition of the accumulated CH4 will
move towards, and eventually reach, that of the
initial CO2, Figure 4.1 shows that, depending on
whether or not reaction products are lost from the
reservoir, a very wide range of isotope ratios of
both reactant and product can result from reservoir
processes.
Equilibrium isotope fractionation occurs because
the thermodynamic properties of isotopically sub-
stituted species differ. When reactions involving
isotopically substituted compounds come to equilib-
rium, isotopes are distributed between the com-
pounds such that the free energy of the system in
question is minimized. For example, in the reaction
in which CO2 equilibrates with water,
(9)

4.2.3 Isotope geothermometry
Like most reactions, the equilibrium constant, or
fractionation factor of an isotope exchange reaction,
is temperature dependent. This forms the basis of
stable isotope geothermometry. Above about O°C,
in most mineral-water or mineral-mineral systems,
In UA-B varies as an approximately linear function
of 1/T2, where T is in kelvin. In general, using A
and B as constants for a particular mineral-mineral
or mineral-water pair:
103 In a = A.106/T2 + B
(13)
so that the per mille fractionation (103 In u) de-
creases with temperature.
Examples of the temperature dependence of
mineral-water fractionation factors are shown in
Fig. 4.2. In some cases the slopes of the fractiona-
tion equations for two cogenetic minerals are very
different. Under these circumstances, the difference
in isotopic ratios between the two minerals defines
the precipitation temperature, but only if the min-
erals

coevally,
and
in
equilibrium.
In diagenetic systems, it is extremely difficult to
demonstrate that any two minerals fulfil these cri-
teria, so estimation of precipitation temperature
invariably requires an assumption about the isotopic
composition of the mineralizing fluid (Fig. 4.3). This
is a major disadvantage. It means that the accuracy
of isotope geothermometry in sedimentary rocks
is always dependent on an assumption about the
isotopic composition of waters probably long since
disappeared.
where n is the number of atoms exchanged. As in
equation (9), it is usual to write isotope exchange
reactions such that only one atom is exchanged. In
that case, using equation (9) as an example:

Fig. 4.2 (a) Oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite

isotopic composition of calcite is a function of both temper-
ature and the isotopic composition of the water from which
the calcite formed. (c) 0180H20 must be specified in order
to define the temperature at which calcite formed. If two
minerals, such as dolomite and calcite, formed in equi-
librium from the same water, then the difference in the
isotopic compositions of the minerals (L1 = 0180dol -
0180calc) defines, uniquely, the precipitation temperature.
4.2.4 Analytical methods
Measurements of the isotopic ratios of the light
elements are made in stable isotope ratio mass spec-
trometers using the following gases: H2 (hydrogen),
CO2(carbon and oxygen) and S02 or SF6 (sulphur).
The basic analytical procedures are similar in each
case and are discussed in detail in standard isotope
texts such as Hoefs (1987) and Faure (1986). The
principal stages in the analysis are as follows.
1 Separation and purification of the material for
analysis. A typical sample size is 5-15 mg, although
the sensitivity of modern mass spectrometers is
such that, with care, submilligram samples may be
analysed routinely.
2 Quantitative conversion of the element to the gas
which will be analysed in the mass spectrometer.
3 Purification of the gas by vacuum distillation.
4 Determination of the isotopic composition of the
gas by mass spectrometry, relative to that of a
laboratory standard.
S Calculation of the isotopic composition of the
sample relative to the relevant international stand-
ard (Table 4.3; the isotopic composition of the
laboratory standard is known relative to that of the
international standard).
Analytical precision is dependent on several fac-
tors including sample inhomogeneity, sample pre-
paration and mass spectrometry. Precision may be
reported in different ways. In some cases, only
errors
incurred
during
mass
spectrometry
are
quoted, generally on the order of ± 0.01%0 for
carbon and oxygen, ± 0.020/00 for sulphur and ± 0.3%0
for hydrogen. These are not however a true reflec-
tion of total error because most error derives from
sample inhomogeneity and preparation. A better
(and more common) way of quoting precision is
reproducibility, which is the ability of the analyst to
obtain the same result from different aliquots of
the same sample. For example, an isotope analysis
might be reported as: 0180
= +18.4 ± 0.2%0 (20').
The second value is the analytical precision quoted
as two standard deviations (20') from the mean
result. This is the analyst's estimate of the likelihood
that, should the analysis be repeated, the same
result within the quoted limits would be obtained:
the analyst is 95% sure that a repeat result between
18.2 and 18.6%0 would be obtained. Typical 20'
reproducibilities are: ± 0.1%0 for CO2and S02, and
± 1%0 for H2.
Analytical accuracy is monitored by continuously
analysing a standard of known isotopic composi-

tion. However, even if we achieve accurate sample
analyses, we must remember that the analyses are
only average representations of the material that
we have separated. If we have failed to separate
illite from kaolinite, we cannot expect an accurate
analysis of illite. The answer to this most funda-
mental problem lies in the development of in situ
methods of analysis. Two analytical methods have
shown promise: laser pyrolysis and secondary ion
mass spectrometry (SIMS). Lasers have been used
to convert sulphides and carbonates in thin-sections
to S02 and CO2 for mass spectrometric analysis
(Dickson, 1991; Dickson et ai., 1991). Reason-
able sulphur and hydrogen isotope analyses have
also been obtained from SIMS, albeit with lower
precision than from conventional mass spectrometry
(Eldridge et ai., 1988; Deloule et ai., 1991).
4.2.5 Data interpretation: general problems
Sensible interpretation of stable isotope data rests
on a series of assumptions common to all isotope
systems. These will be considered further for each
isotope system but their universal importance jus-
tifies their collection here.
I The sample is pure and well characterized. It is
notoriously difficult to obtain pure mineral separates
from sedimentary rocks. There are three general
problems. Firstly, it may be difficult to separate a
pure mineral phase. X-ray diffraction can be used to
detect contaminants if they comprise more than 5%
of the mixture (Section 2.7), but at levels below this,
one is obliged to devote a lot of time to the deter-
mination of mineral abundances by point-counting
(which is itself unreliable for clay minerals; Section
2.2). The second problem arises when the separate
consists of both detrital and authigenic forms of a
single mineral. Again, it will usually be necessary to
resort to point-counting (though see Section 5.3.5
for an attempt to calculate end member K-Ar ages
using chemical discriminants). Thirdly, one may
obtain a pure separate of the authigenic phase, but
find that it is zoned, which may imply growth from
chemically distinct fluids. In situ analysis may be the
only solution to this problem.
2 Isotopic ratios have been preserved since min-
eral precipitation. In general, isotope exchange at
diagenetic temperatures is only effected between
minerals and fluids when chemical bonds are broken
and reformed; that is, when minerals recrystallize or
react to form new minerals (see O'Neil, 1987, for
a review). Some minerals, notably clays and car-
bonates, are more susceptible than others to reaction
or recrystallization. Partial or total recrystallization
may be
revealed
by
conventional petrography,
cathodoluminescence and/or electron microscopy.

Experimental and empirical evidence suggests that
in clay minerals,hydrogen and possibly oxygen
isotope exchange may occur at temperatures above
100°C (O'Neil & Kharaka, 1976; Bird & Chivas,
1988; Longstaffe & Ayalon, 1990). A checklist for
the susceptibility of diagenetic minerals to recrystal-
lization and to isotopic exchange is shown in Table
4.4. As a general rule, the stable isotope composi-
tion of a mineral records information about the
temperature and fluid with which the mineral last
underwent isotopic exchange.
3 Minerals formed in isotopic equilibrium with the
fluid from which they precipitated. For minerals
precipitating directly from solution, this is generally
true unless vital isotope effects are suspected. How-
ever, where (i) replacement reactions have occurred,
in which part of the isotopic signature of the new
phase may be derived from its precursor, and (ii)
reactions which may involve kinetic or vital isotope
effects are suspected, care must be taken when
interpreting the isotopic analyses. Most important
amongst the latter are bacterial and thermochemical
sulphate reduction.
4 Isotope
fractionation
factors
are
accurately
known. Because isotope exchange reactions proceed
very slowly at the relatively low temperatures char-
acteristic of diagenesis, fractionation factors are
often determined at high temperatures and extra-
polated to low temperatures. This is justified in
some cases (e.g. oxygen in quartz and carbonates),
but can introduce significant uncertainty in many
others (e.g. oxygen and hydrogen in clay minerals;
Table 4.4). A further difficulty is that for some
minerals - illite for example - even dubious experi-
Stable Isotopes 79
mental data are scarce. When using fractionation
factors one should bear in mind the conditions under
which they were originally determined.
4.3 Oxygen and hydrogen
4.3.1 Water
Reactions of interest to petroleum geologists tend to
occur in aqueous media and include precipitation of
mineral skeletons from marine waters and diagenetic
reactions which may occur in a wide variety of water
types from marine and meteoric through to deep
basinal fluids. Accordingly, we gain more infor-
mation about the reactions by studying not only
diagenetic minerals, but also waters from which they
may have precipitated. Isotopic study of waters in
petroleum reservoirs can also provide information
about the continuity of different water types in
reservoirs and can assist in reservoir correlation and
in identifying changes in water composition as the
reservoir is produced.
Formation
waters
(waters within
sedimentary
basins) are derived from four basic sources, each of
which is isotopically (and chemically) distinct (Fig.
4.4).
1 Meteoric water. Meteoric waters originate as rain
and snow. Their oD and 0180 compositions vary
systematically and define the meteoric water line
(MWL), which is expressed as (Craig, 1961):
oD = 80180 + 10
(14)
This regularity results from the systematic behaviour
of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes during successive

evaporation-condensation cycles.
Water
evapo-
rated from the oceans is depleted in
180 and D
compared to ocean water, becoming increasingly
depleted as an increasing proportion of the water
vapour condenses as rainfall (Rayleigh fractiona-
tion; see Section 4.2.2). Since on a global scale
water vapour is transported from low to high latit-
udes, and from ocean to continental interiors, the
isotopic composition of meteoric water changes in
a geographically predictable way (Fig. 4.5). With
palaeogeographical insight, one can thus estimate
the isotopic composition of palaeo-meteoric waters.
2 Ocean
water.
Standard
mean
ocean
water
(SMOW) has, by definition, oD and 0180 = 00/00 and
most ocean waters fall close to this value. It is less
clear whether ocean water has maintained the same
isotopic composition throughout the geological past.
On an ice-free earth, ocean water probably had a
0180 value about 1%0 lighter than today's oceans
(Shackleton & Opdyke, 1973). There is consider-
able debate as to whether the 0180 of the oceans
has varied on longer timescales, particularly in the
Palaeozoic and earlier. The debate is rooted in the
observation that the oxygen isotopic composition of
marine carbonates and cherts decreases with increas-
ing age (see reviews by O'Neil, 1986; Veizer et al.,
1986). Possible explanations for this are: (i) older
rocks have had more time to equilibrate with iso-
topically light meteoric waters; (ii) 0180
of the
oceans was lower in the past; and (iii) the oceans
were warmer in the past. Of these, (ii) and (iii) have
gained most credence, with slight favour towards an
ocean which was warmer but isotopically similar to
today's.
3 Evaporation
residues
(bitterns).
During
the
evaporation of seawater, the isotopic compositions
of the residual brine define a hook on a plot of oD
versus 0180 (Knauth & Beeunas, 1986). Depending
on the degree of evaporation, these waters can be
enriched or depleted in D and
180
compared to
seawater.
4 Metamorphic
water.
Metamorphic waters
are
defined here as waters which have been expelled
into sediments from underlying basement rocks.
They have variable isotopic ratios but are charac-
terized by their high 0180 values.
Most formation waters have isotopic compositions
which plot to the right of the MWL but which rarely
correspond to the four end-members described
above (Fig. 4.6). Waters within individual basins
have
isotopic
compositions
which
often
define
restricted regions of the standard oD: 8180 diagram.
Nevertheless, a wide range of isotopic compositions
occurs in anyone basin, and it is dangerous to

The chemical and isotopic composition of a forma-
tion water is an integrated record of its origin and
subsequent diagenesis. The relevant diagenetic pro-
cesses may be loosely divided into two categories:
mixing - between meteoric, metamorphic, evapora-
tive and ocean waters; and reaction -
between
sedimentary minerals and waters. Comparison of
Figs 4.4 and 4.6 shows how simple mixing between
the
four
end-member
waters
can
theoretically
account for much of the observed variation in the
isotopic composition of formation waters. However,
all necessary end-members may well not be avail-
able in anyone basin. Reactions between water and
minerals result in the repartitioning of isotopes and
a corresponding change in the isotopic composition
of both. If the water-mineral system is closed, then
the isotopic composition of the total system must
remain constant. However, the isotopic composition
of the phases in the system can change. The extent
of change partly depends on the fractionation factor
between mineral and water, and partly on the rela-
tive amounts of the isotopic species in mineral and
water, the
water-rock ratio.
Isotopic exchange
between a small amount of mineral and a large
amount of water will result in a large change in the
isotopic composition of the mineral, but very little
change in that of the water, and vice versa. These
ideas are illustrated in Fig. 4.7a. The closed system
initially comprises smectite and water containing
equal masses of oxygen. The oxygen isotopic com-
position of the system, at the fulcrum, is +11%0
and cannot change. If the smectite then recrystallizes
to form illite at 100oe, the isotopic separation be-
tween illite and water is defined by the fractionation
factor at 1000e (12.80/00). The isotopic composition
of the system remains constant at 11%0, but the
isotopic composition of both water and mineral are
substantially changed. A similar situation is shown
in Fig. 4.7b, but in this case 90% of the system's
oxygen is in the water. Following recrystallization of
smectite to illite, the isotopic separation of mineral
and water is 12.8%0, but most of the isotopic change
has taken place in the mineral, leaving the water
largely unchanged.
Taylor (1974) expressed the isotope mass balance
approach in terms of some simple equations. In a
closed system, in which sediment is simply buried
and reacts with its interstitial water, the material
balance equation is:

Fig. 4.9 The oxygen isotopic composition of water plotted
as a function of effective water-rock ratio. The
water-rock system modelled using equation (16) is one in
which smectite recrystallizes to illite at 100°C. &180 of
initial water = -50/00; &180 of smectite = 22%0; &180 of
illite = 19%0. Significant shifts from the initial isotopic
composition of the water only occur at low water-rock
ratios.
The most commonly observed authigenic silicate
minerals are quartz and the clay minerals illite,
where ~ = brf -
bWf (the fractionation factor between
mineral and water at the reaction temperature).
The isotope mass balance approach is relevant
to sedimentary basins because, except in areas of
hydrodynamically driven recharge, they probably
approximate to closed systems. Both Suchecki and
Land (1983) and Aplin et al. (1993) used this ap-
proach to show that the observed 180 enrichment of
formation waters in compacting sedimentary basins
could be explained by clay mineral recrystallization
in mudstones (Fig. 4.8). The hydrogen isotope com-
position of waters also changes during this process.
However, the extent of change is much less than that
of oxygen because the hydrogen balance of the
sedimentary basin is dominated by water, not rock
minerals.
Equation (16) can be used to determine the extent
to which b180HP changes as a function of water-
rock ratio, for a given mineral-water reaction. For
reactions relevant to diagenetic systems, such as clay
or carbonate recrystallization, water- rock ratios
greater than about five will result in little change in
8180H20 (Fig. 4.9). This means that if more than
a few pore volumes of water pass through and
isotopically exchange with rock minerals, the effect
of the reactions will not be recorded in the water.
An important corollary of this is that there are finite
volumes of
l80-enriched
water
in
sedimentary
basins. Whether 180-enriched waters derive from:
(i) reaction with rock minerals; and/or (ii) mixing
involving metamorphic or evaporative waters, their
total volume is constrained by the volume of reac-

lites are generally less abundant. Preferred oxygen
isotope fractionation factors are listed in Table 4.5

Quartz
In many ways quartz is the ideal mineral for oxy-
gen isotope analysis. Although the oxygen isotope
fractionation between quartz and water has only

been determined at high temperatures, extrapola-
tion to lower temperatures yields values which are in
broad agreement with those measured on opaline
silica in real systems (Matsuhisa et al., 1979; Kita et
al., 1985). Furthermore, experiments and empirical
observations suggest that post-depositional isotopic
exchange is unlikely (with the possible exception of
extremely fine-grained [< O.5 ~m] quartz at tem-
peratures above 150°C; Yeh & Savin, 1977). The
major problem associated with the isotopic analysis
of authigenic quartz is separating a pure sample from
detrital quartz grains. Two approaches are currently
used, neither of which is entirely satisfactory (Brint
et al., 1991).
1 Leaching/mass
balance
approach.
Following
gentle disaggregation of a sandstone sample, quartz
is isolated by chemical dissolution of all other phases
(Syers et al., 1968). Two measurements are then
made: the isotopic composition of the quartz separ-
ate and the proportion of detrital and authigenic
quartz in the isolate. The quartz is then leached with
HF, preferentially removing the authigenic over-
growths. By measuring the isotopic composition of
the detrital quartz residue, the isotopic composition
of authigenic quartz can be calculated by mass
balance (Milliken et al., 1981). This procedure is
subject to several errors which are much greater
than the analytical precision. These include: (i)
variations in 0180 of detrital quartz; (ii) the presence
of quartz overgrowths from previous sedimentary
cycles; (iii) the procedure used to calculate 0180
of authigenic quartz, which
involves significant
extrapolation from measured values; and (iv) the
occurrence of zonation in the authigenic quartz,
implying
isotopic
heterogeneity.
Accuracies
of
± 2%0 may be realistically achieved.
2 Separation of quartz overgrowths. In this ap-
proach, the quartz isolate is etched in weak HF, and
then subjected to ultrasonic agitation (Lee & Savin,
1985). The HF exploits zones of weakness in the
quartz separate, which include the boundary be-
tween the detrital quartz grain and overgrowth.
Authigenic quartz is concentrated in the finer grain
sizes which are recovered by sieving. Purity can be
checked using cathodoluminescence
microscopy.
An example is shown in Fig. 4.10. This technique
appears to be reasonably successful for samples
where there is a marked zone of weakness -
for example a dust rim -
between the detrital
grain and overgrowth, but in the absence of such
a zone spalling may occur along fractures within the
detrital grain and lead to very significant errors
Stable Isotopes 85
(Brint et al., 1991). Purity checks are therefore
essential.
Clay minerals
The advantage of stable isotope analysis of clay
minerals is that both 8180 and oD can be deter-
mined on the same sample, theoretically enabling
unique characterization of the isotopic composition
of the water from which the mineral formed. Any
excitement should however be tempered by un-
certainties over clay mineral-water fractionation
factors and by the real possibility that some clay
minerals may suffer isotopic exchange after they
form.
At
diagenetic
temperatures,
mineral-water
fractionation factors for oxygen isotopes are only
known to ± 1-20/00 (Fig. 4.11). This reflects not only
the difficulty of determining fractionation factors
for clay minerals, but also the fact that they vary
according to chemical composition within a par-
ticular group of clay minerals. Errors of ± 1-2%0
could lead to a similar error in an estimate of 0180 of
the mineralizing fluid, or to an error in the estimated
precipitation temperature of about ± 20°C. The best
estimates for the hydrogen isotope clay mineral-
water fractionation equations are given in Table 4.6;
the uncertainties are even greater than those for
oxygen. There can be reasonable confidence for
kaolinite, since data derived from experimental
work
and field
observations
generally coincide
(Savin & Lee, 1988). The data for smectite and illite
are less certain and are probably not accurate to
better than ± 10%0.
In addition to the uncertainties in clay mineral-
water isotope fractionation factors, there is also
evidence that under certain conditions clay min-
erals can undergo isotopic exchange with whatever
water happens to be around. Isotopic exchange
at diagenetic temperatures is usually associated
with mineralogical change. The transformation of
smectite to illite in Gulf Coast shales is a good
example, involving major oxygen and hydrogen
isotopic shifts (Yeh & Savin, 1977; Yeh, 1980).
However, experimental and field data suggest that
hydrogen, and possibly oxygen isotope exchange
can occur independently of mineralogical change in
some clay mineral groups. Smectites are the most
susceptible: there is a strong possibility that both
oxygen and hydrogen isotope exchange occur at
temperatures around 100°C (O'Neil & Kharaka,
1976). The situation is more complex for illite and
kaolinite which appear to be robust with respect to

oxygen but susceptible with respect to hydrogen,
even at temperatures as low as 40°C (O'Neil &
Kharaka, 1976; Bird & Chivas, 1988; Longstaffe &
Ayalon, 1990). However, in all the cases where
hydrogen isotope exchange could be documented,
the clay minerals interacted with large volumes of
water which was isotopically very different to that
from which they formed. In situations where water-
rock ratios are low, isotope exchange may not
occur, or may be impossible to identify if the iso-
topic compositions of new and original mineralizing
fluids are similar.
As for quartz, it can be difficult to obtain a pure
sample of an authigenic clay mineral. ~ clay mineral
concentrate can usually be isolated from a gently
disaggregated sandstone by settling methods because
clay minerals are concentrated in the fine « 2 ~m)
fraction (Section 2.7.3). It is much more difficult to
isolate a specific mineral species from a mixture of
clay minerals or to separate an authigenic mineral
species from its detrital counterpart. Rules of thumb
include the observation that some authigenic clays
tend to be concentrated in the finest size fractions
« 0.1-0.5 ~m), and that illite tends to occur in finer
fractions than kaolinite, but there is no substitute for
designing each separation process according to the
sizes of the minerals to be analysed in the sample in
question (these can be determined by examination

reached a maximum burial temperature of less than
80°C before being uplifted in the Tertiary (Fig.
4.13). It was also possible to determine the isotopic
compositions of the first and last waters in the
formation. The present-day formation water was
analysed whilst the isotopic composition of the fresh
water in which the sandstones were deposited was
estimated from the relationship between latitude
and 8180 of meteoric water (Fig. 4.5). Since meteoric
water is the isotopically lightest water that could
have passed through the formation, quartz must
have formed at temperatures higher than 40°C, and
could not have formed from a water enriched in 180
compared to seawater (Fig. 4.13). Beyond that, all
is speculation. The cement could have formed at
present-day burial temperatures, but from a fluid
depleted in
180 compared to the water presently
in the reservoir. Such a water could be meteoric
water which infiltrated during Tertiary uplift, but

using a SEM). Attempts have also been made to
isolate mineral groups (chlorite, illite, kaolinite)
with magnetic separators, with mixed success (Tellier
et al., 1988). If, as is often the case, it is impos-
sible to obtain a pure authigenic mineral separate,
then it is important to estimate the proportions of
each mineral in the mixture. For a multimineralic
mixture, this can be done by X-ray diffraction
(quick and imprecise) or TEM (slow but more pre-
cise).
4.3.3 Example 1: quartz cement in a Pennsylvanian
sandstone, West Tuscola Field, north-central Texas
This study was published in 1978 by Land and Dutton
and concerns the isotope geochemistry of diagenetic
phases in a deltaic sandstone reservoir. It is a bench-
mark paper in that it was one of the first to use high
quality isotope data to investigate the diagenetic
history of a sandstone and was perhaps the first to
present good quality isotope analyses of authigenic
quartz in a reservoir sandstone.
Land and Dutton chose a suite of quartz-rich
samples which were variably cemented with quartz
cement and used a version of the leaching/mass
balance approach to obtain the isotopic composition
of authigenic quartz. Following chemical purifica-
tion (Syers et al., 1968), the isotopic composition of
the quartz was determined and plotted against the
ratio of authigenic quartz: total quartz, as estimated
from point-count data (Fig. 4.12). Linear regression
of the data gave a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and
estimates of the isotopic composition of detrital and
authigenic quartz of + 12.6 and +24.5roo respec-
tively. The value of 12.6%0 for detrital quartz com-
pared with 11.9roo for a sample of pure detrital
quartz. This difference gives some impression of the
uncertainty in the estimate of 5180 of authigenic
quartz; this is about ± lroo, much greater than the
analytical precision (O.lroo).
Since the isotopic composition of quartz is a func-
tion of both precipitation temperature and 5180 of
the mineralizing fluid, a single isotopic composition
can result from many combinations of 5180HzO and
temperature (Fig. 4.13). Constraints on the true
conditions of precipitation therefore rely entirely
on additional geological and geochemical data or
assumptions. The supporting data in this example
included a paragenetic sequence determined by
thin-section petrography, which showed that quartz
was a relatively early phase, and an approximate
burial history which suggested that the samples

quartz in a Pennsylvanian deltaic sandstone. The curves
represent the isotopic composition of quartz cement.
Quartz could not have precipitated from a water
isotopically heavier than SMOW, nor when the sandstone
was first deposited. It could have formed from a Tertiary
meteoric water at about 40°C, when the formation was
uplifted but petrographic evidence suggests that it was a
relatively early cement. Land and Dutton's interpretation
was that quartz probably formed at or close to maximum
burial temperature from a water with similar
characteristics to that presently in the formation.
4.3.4 Example 2: illite cement in fluvial sandstone,
Brent Group, Northern North Sea
This example considers the problems of determining
the isotopic composition of authigenic illite in a rock
that also contains detrital illite. We will return to the
same example in Section 5.3.5 where we will look at
the difficulties that the presence of detrital illite
poses for K- Ar dating. In the well examined in
this study, Middle Jurassic fluvial sandstones of the
Brent Group have undergone continuous burial and
presently reside at their maximum burial depth of
4.3 km, at a temperature of 145°C. An initial SEM
study revealed that two morphological types of illite
were present: platy illite, which was inferred to
be detrital, and fibrous illite, considered to be
authigenic.
Clays were separated from core by centrifuging
disaggregated samples and then divided into size
fractions « 0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-2 and 2-5 flm). Clay
separates were examined using TEM in order to
estimate visually the relative proportions of detrital
and authigenic illite. In general, platy, detrital illite
was concentrated preferentially in the coarser frac-
tions. Oxygen isotope compositions of clay separates
are listed in Table 5.3 and plotted in Fig. 4.14 as a
function of the proportion of authigenic illite in the
analysed mixture. If the isotopic compositions of
detrital and authigenic illite are homogeneous, then
the data should plot on a straight line. To a first
approximation, they do: least squares regression
and extrapolation give 8180 of authigenic illite as
+14.5 ± 0.60/00 and SI80 of detrital illite as +16.5 ±
1.20/00*. The uncertainties here are, as usual, much
greater than the analytical precision.
Without an independent measure of precipitation
temperature, even the best isotopic data can only
loosely constrain the conditions of illite cement
* The calculated 0180 value is surprisingly low for detrital
illite. As a continental weathering product, illite would be
expected to have formed in meteoric water at about lO°e.
The isotopic composition of water in equilibrium with illite
with &180 = +16.5'Yoo at lOoC is about -9%0, compared to
-4 or -5%0 for local meteoric water at the time the
formation was deposited. This apparent anomaly may be
explained in two ways: either the illite inherited some light
oxygen from the primary igneous mineral from which it
formed or it recrystallized during burial diagenesis. For
example, if the illite had recrystallized in meteoric water at
50°C, it would have &180
= +14 to +15%0. This would
leave a niggling doubt as to whether the authigenic illite
might also have done the same thing.

paragenetic sequence argues against this. Land and
Dutton's preferred hypothesis was that the quartz
formed from a water similar to that present in the
reservoir today, but at the maximum burial tem-
perature of the sequence. The implications would be
that: (i) the quartz precipitated from relatively
small volumes of basinal water, since the water is
isotopically evolved from
the original meteoric
water; (ii) large-scale fluid flow may not have been
the cause of cementation, since the water in the
reservoir at the time of cementation is the same as
that today; and (iii) cementation was not driven by
the ingress of meteoric water due to uplift of the
basin margin, but by another mechanism. Reservoir
quality would not in this case have been controlled
by the access of meteoric water. The conclusions
sound plausible and are potentially useful for predict-
ing reservoir quality, but it should not be forgotten
that the data are open to alternative explanations.

Fig. 4.14 Oxygen isotope compositions of illite separates as a function of the proportion of authigenic illite in the analysed
sample, we1l3/8b-11, UK North Sea. The diagram shows isotopic analyses of 12 separates, 4 (joined by lines) from each of
3 sandstone samples. Data may be found in Table 5.3. The proportion of authigenic illite in each separate analysed was
estimated visually using TEM by a form of point-counting based on the difference in morphology between authigenic
(fibrous) and detrital (platy) illite. This procedure is prone to potentially large errors that are hard to quantify. Separates
with greater proportions of detrital illite have somewhat higher 8 180 values, but the correlation is not particularly good.
The quoted end-member isotopic compositions have an error that does not take into account uncertainty in point-counting.
The isotopic compositions of three separates of coarse detrital muscovite are plotted on the right hand axis for reference
only; they are quite different from those calculated for detrital illite. See Section 5.3.5. for an attempt to discriminate
detrital and authigenic illite on the basis of chemical composition.
formation. Calculated authigenic illite 8180 is shown
on a temperature: 8180 HzO plot in Fig. 4.15. In this
example, temperature was estimated independently
by combining K-Ar ages with a time-temperature
graph for the samples based on modelling of their
burial and thermal history.
Illite grew between
about 50 and 72 Ma ago at temperatures between
about 90 and 130°C (see Section 5.3.5). Figure 4.15
shows that the isotopic composition of the miner-
alizing water must therefore have been between
about -0.5 and +4.50/00. The present water in the
formation has D180
= +1.9%0, much heavier than
local meteoric waters, and has probably acquired its
isotopic composition by reaction with sedimentary
minerals (Section 4.3.1). If illite cementation was
driven by fluid flow, then convective or compac-
tionaI flow is suggested, not hydrodynamic flow from
basin margins.
Further insight into the nature of the mineraliz-
ing fluid ought to be available from the hydrogen
isotope composition of the clay minerals. Figure
4.16 is a plot of DD against proportion of authigenic
illite in the separates analysed. The most striking
feature of the data is their variability. The isotopic
composition of apparently relatively pure authigenic
illite ranges from about -20 to -70%0, far greater
than the usual analytical precision (± 2%0). This
may be interpreted in several ways: the illite may
have formed in waters with widely varying isotopic
compositions; there may be an unidentified ana-
lytical problem, for example the presence of organic
contaminants; or the
illites
may
have
partially
re-equilibrated with the present formation water
(80 = -25%0). Based on Yeh's (1980) fractiona-
tion equation, illite in equilibrium with this water
would have 80 =
-500/00 at the present reservoir
temperature.

fractionation
factors
are
well
known at diagenetic temperatures and can be used
with some confidence (Table 4.5). Fractionation
factors for siderite are less well constrained, with
the most commonly used equation that of Carothers
et al. (1988). Mineral-water fractionations for inter-
mediates in the solid solution series are not known
specifically. In these cases, it is common practice to
assume the same fractionation as for the chemically
nearest end-member, or to interpolate between the
two end-members.
For our purposes, the two main applications of
oxygen isotopes in carbonate systems are:
1 the estimation of temperatures of precipitation of
diagenetic carbonates; and
2 oxygen
isotope
stratigraphy
from
unaltered
marine carbonate fossils, which has permitted a very
high
stratigraphic
resolution
in
the
Neogene
(Trainor et al., 1988).
Estimation of the temperature of precipitation of
carbonate diagenetic phases from oxygen isotopes
is identical in principle to temperature estimation
using quartz or clay minerals. Carbonate rocks will
often comprise a whole range of carbonate mineral
components,
including
original
marine
calcite,
possibly several calcite cement phases precipitated
in a variety of diagenetic environments, and other
carbonate minerals such as dolomite. There is no
point in making a whole-rock isotopic analysis of
such a complex mixture of phases and expecting to
derive meaningful information about precipitation
temperatures. Different phases of interest must be
analysed separately to derive useful oxygen isotope
ratios (see Hudson, 1977). This can only be done
in conjunction with detailed petrography. Once
identified, original marine precipitates can be phys-
ically separated from cements by the use of stout
needles or by modified dentist's drills. Where phys-
ical separation is impossible, whole-rock analysis
can reasonably be undertaken on samples which
appear to comprise simple mixtures whose propor-
tions have been quantified prior to analysis (Emery
et al., 1988). When carbonate rocks comprise too
many different phases which cannot be physically
separated or when they are zoned on a small scale,
in situ analysis by laser pyrolysis is the best option
(Dickson et al., 1991). In sandstones, carbonate
cements tend not to present the same problems of
separation because it is often possible to identify
areas in a thin-section which are cemented by a
single carbonate.
They
may
nonetheless
show
complex zonation, in which case in situ analysis
is preferable.
A problem common to carbonate cements in
siliciclastic and carbonate rocks is recrystallization.
Field and experimental evidence suggests that fine-
grained carbonates commonly recrystallize above
100°C, particularly where water-rock ratios are
high (Clayton et al., 1968; O'Neil, 1987). The situ-
ation is less clear-cut for the relatively coarse crystal-
line carbonates which commonly cement sandstones.
Ayalon and Longstaffe (1988) found that early
diagenetic calcite in some deeply buried sandstones
in the Western Canada Basin had very variable 8180
values which they interpreted as indicating partial
recrystallization and isotopic resetting of an initially
homogeneous cement. On the other hand, com-
parison of the isotopic composition of carbonates
and formation waters in several North Sea reservoir
sandstones commonly shows that they are not in
equilibrium.
These
cements
could
have
recry-
stallized,
but
not
recently.
If complex
zoning
patterns are preserved, one can probably be reason-
ably happy that recrystallization has not taken
place. In general, recrystallization is more likely at
higher temperatures and where there are large dif-
ferences between precipitation and maximum burial
temperatures.
Oxygen isotope stratigraphy is based on the record
of glaciations and deglaciations preserved by the
isotopic signature of marine fossils, which essentially
record the changes in the bulk isotopic composition
of seawater. Variations in the isotopic composition
of seawater are controlled largely by the volume of
ice on the Earth's surface. Ice will preferentially
contain the lighter isotope,
160, because most
originates as precipitation at high latitudes (Section
4.3.1). During glaciations, the seawater will be cor-
respondingly enriched in 180, whereas during inter-
glacials the 8180 value of seawater will approach 00/00
or slightly negative values (Shackleton & Opdyke,
1973). Marine carbonate (chiefly aragonite, calcite
or high magnesium calcite) fossils will preserve this
isotopic difference, which can be used to provide an
isotope stratigraphy of high resolution, particularly
over the last 4 Ma or so. The marine carbonate
fossils used must come from the same living posi-
tion in the oceans, otherwise temperature changes
through the water column may mask changes in bulk
seawater isotopic compositions. They should also
ideally be of the same species or genus (otherwise
vital effects may mask the isotope stratigraphic
record) and should show no diagenetic alteration.
Section 8.2 provides more information on the
practical problems of oxygen isotope stratigraphy.

4.3.6 Sulphates
Although anhydrite (CaS04) and barite (BaS04)
are locally important mineral cements, their oxygen
isotopic composition is rarely reported. The main
reason for this is that at most diagenetic temperat-
ures the oxygen in the dissolved sulphate molecule
and in the water itself are not in isotopic equilibrium
because the kinetics of the isotope exchange reac-
tion are slow. The rate at which oxygen isotopes are
exchanged between dissolved sulphate and water
is a function of solution pH and temperature; lower
pH and higher temperature facilitate isotopic ex-
change (Lloyd, 1968; Chiba & Sakai, 1981). Experi-
mental data suggest that at pH 6 isotopic equilibrium
between dissolved sulphate and water is achieved
within hours or days at 200°C, but takes 105_106
years at 100°C. Only at temperatures above about
150°C can the
oxygen
isotope
composition
of
sulphate be used as a geothermometer or to infer
the conditions under which the sulphate formed.
In seawater, more than 109 years are required to
achieve isotopic equilibrium between water and dis-
solved sulphate. However, since the ocean mixing
time is around 2000 years, the oxygen isotopic com-
position of dissolved seawater sulphate is constant
throughout the oceans at any time. Because the
relative magnitude of the various sources of sea-
water sulphate has varied through geological time,
so has 0180 of seawater sulphate (Claypool et al.,
1980). Despite the significant uncertainty in the
precise shape of the secular curve, the oxygen isotope
composition of buried evaporites has potential as a
stratigraphic tool.
4.4 Carbon
4.4.1 Principles
Equilibr'ium carbon isotope fractionation factors in
the carbonate system are given in Table 4.7. Com-
pared to oxygen, carbon isotope fractionation is
Stable Isotopes 93
relatively insensitive to temperature so that carbon
isotopes are of little use as geothermometers. Their
main use in diagenetic systems is to unravel the
origin of carbon in carbonate cements.
There are two major carbon reservoirs in sedi-
mentary basins: marine carbonate, the product of
biological or chemical precipitation from seawater;
and reduced organic carbon, derived mainly from
marine and land plants buried within fine-grained
sediments. Other reservoirs (atmospheric CO2, soil
CO2 , mantle CO2) may be locally important. The
two main carbon reservoirs are readily distinguish-
able by their isotopic signatures (Fig. 4.17). Most
marine carbonates have Ol3C of 0 ± 40/00. In contrast,
the conversion of CO2 to organic carbon is accom-
panied by a series of kinetic isotopic fractionations
which produces organic matter with a range of Ol3C
values between about -10 and - 35%0, most typically
between -20 and -300/00. Petroleum has a similar
isotopic composition to the kerogen from which
it is generated (see Deines, 1980 for a detailed
discussion).
CH4 is isotopically distinct from both marine car-
bonate and
reduced organic carbon reservoirs.
There are two isotopically distinct CH4 reservoirs:
isotopically light (-50 to -90%0) biogenic CH4
('marsh gas') which is produced at temperatures
below 70°C by bacterially mediated processes; and
isotopically heavier (-20 to - 55%0) thermogenic
CH4 which is generated by thermal breakdown of
kerogen and oil. Since there is a kinetic isotope
fractionation of about - 25%0 associated with this
reaction, early generated (low maturity) CH4 is
isotopically lighter than CH4 generated at high
maturity (Clayton, 1991).
If reduced organic carbon is to contribute to
carbonate cements, it must first be converted into
carbonate. There are two pathways by which this
occurs in sedimentary basins. Firstly, the organic
matter itself contains a certain amount of oxygen
which is liberated as CO2 or organic acids, mainly
prior to oil generation. Secondly, organic carbon

can be oxidized by inorganic oxidants such as mo-
lecular oxygen, sulphate and ferric iron. Reactions
in both pathways may be purely chemical or, at
lower temperatures, catalysed by bacteria. The pro-
cesses by which organic carbon is converted to
HC03- at low temperatures have been well docu-
mented from studies of recent muds. During early
diagenesis (within metres of the sediment-water
interface), bacteria obtain energy by sequentially
oxidizing organic matter using oxygen,
nitrate,
manganese and iron oxides, and sulphate (Fig. 4.18;
Froehlich et al., 1979). Bicarbonate is a by-product
of all these reactions and has an isotopic composi-
tion similar to the precursor organic matter (- 20 to
- 25%0).
Given the correct chemical conditions,
carbonate precipitates,
often
as
concretions or
bands, preserving a record of the oxidation process
(Curtis et al., 1972; Coleman & Raiswell, 1981).
If organic matter is buried beyond the sulphate
reduction zone, it can be further degraded by meth-
anogenic bacteria at temperatures up to about 70°C.
Two main metabolic pathways are involved. Acetate

cesses. Oxygen-bearing compounds are thermally
cleaved from kerogen either as CO2 or low molecular
weight organic acids, with an isotopic composition
of -10 to - 200/00. Organic acids may themselves be
decarboxylated between 100 and 200°C (Palmer &
Drummond, 1986). Above 140°C and perhaps above
100°C, low molecular weight hydrocarbons can be
converted to CO2 by reaction with mineral oxidants
such as sulphate or ferric iron. The best known of
these reactions is thermochemical sulphate reduc-
tion, which can be most simply expressed as the
reaction between CH4 and dissolved sulphate:
CH4 + sol- ~ HC03
+ HS- + H 20
(19)
The isotopic composition of instantaneously pro-
duced bicarbonate is similar to that of reactant
CH4. Such light values are, however, rather rarely
observed (e.g. Krouseetal., 1988). More commonly,
and depending on the particular chemical condi-
tions, the produced carbonate further reacts with
pre-existing dissolved
or solid-phase
carbonate,
obscuring its origin. Mixing of dissolved carbonate
from various sources is common in diagenetic sys-
tems and can severely impede an accurate assessment
of the route which led to carbonate cementation.
Many carbonate cements in sandstones have carbon
isotopic compositions between 0 and -12%0 (e.g.
Lundegard et al., 1984), which could be the result of
several combinations of carbon sources (Fig. 4.17).
There is increasing evidence that inorganic reac-
tions are an important source of CO2 in the deeper
sections of sedimentary basins. Reactions between
clay minerals and carbonates are thought to be
potentially important sources of CO2 (Hutcheon et
al., 1980), for example the reaction between siderite
and kaolinite to form chlorite:

The carbon isotopic composition of CO2 in the
methanogenic zone is a function both of the pathway
by which CO2 is produced and the isotopic fractiona-
tion associated with its production. Kinetic isotope
effects are important in both processes; for acetate
fermentation, early formed CO2 is isotopically light
( .....20to - 300/00) but approaches the isotopic com-
position of the carboxyl group as the acetate is fully
converted to CO2 and CH4 (-5 to -10%0; Games
et al., 1978). For CO2 reduction, CH4 is between 25
and 60%0 lighter than precursor CO2, which itself
may be derived from any of the preceding oxidation/
fermentation reactions. As more CO2 is consumed,
residual CO2 becomes enriched in l3C, reaching
values as high as + 15%0. The end result of all these
processes is that the carbon isotopic composition of
CO2 in the methanogenic zone is very variable (Fig.
4.19). Most values are between +2 and -22%0, not
the + 15%0 which is commonly quoted as representa-
tive of methanogenically generated CO2 (see Irwin
et al., 1977). A further complication is that CH4
may be oxidized, aerobically or anaerobically, and
contribute isotopically light CO2 to the total pool
(Whiticar & Faber, 1986; Raiswell, 1988).
Above about 70°C, methanogenic bacteria give up
the struggle and CO2 is produced by chemical pro-

Fig. 4.20 Stratigraphy and isotopic composition of carbonate cements in wells 11-1-4 and 11-l-lA, Liuhua Field, South China Sea (from Turner & Hu, 1991).
Zone C corresponds to a lower porosity cemented interval, in which whole-rock ol3e compositions show a striking fall to l3e depleted values, interpreted to
represent the input of isotopically lighter soil-gas carbon. Above zone C is a higher porosity interval (base zone B) in which bioclasts were leached just below a
soil horizon, now represented by the deflection to high values on the y ray log.

(Erlich et al., 1990). The reservoir consists chiefly
of shallow water carbonate, comprising coral, algal
and other skeletal material and forms an isolated
platform a few hundred metres thick, with an oil
column height of 75 m. It is this upper, petroleum-
bearing portion of the reservoir which shows the
most complex relationships between porosity and
cementation (Turner & Hu, 1990, 1991).
In order to improve the understanding of the
controls on cementation and porosity development
within the oil column, several cores were examined
by thin-section and cathodoluminescence petro-
graphy. There proved to be several petrographically
and diagenetically distinct zones (Fig. 4.20). One
particular zone (C), at approximately 1280 m in well
11-1-4, showed low porosity caused by abundant
pore-filling calcite cement which increased in abund-
ance with depth. This cement appeared to post-
date dissolution of some carbonate bioclasts, but
pre-dated any significant compaction, suggesting
that it was precipitated relatively early. This cement
was also present in well 11-1-1A at approximately
1230 m depth. To constrain further the source(s) of
carbonate for the cement and its origin and environ-
ment of precipitation, isotopic analyses were per-
formed on whole-rock samples taken from the cored
interval in well 11-1-4. <s l3C values show relatively
little variation in the top portion of the core, ranging
between 0 and +2%0. Within zone C, however, 813C
shows a dramatic shift to values as low as -8%0,
tending to decrease as the amount of cement in-
creases (and the amount of porosity falls). No other
major carbon isotopic shifts are seen deeper in the
core (although a less dramatic shift to - 2<J'oo is seen
at approximately 1312m in 11-1-4) and values range
between -2 and +0.5%0. Oxygen isotopic composi-
tions do not show such an obvious shift, with a slight
depletion in
180
of slightly less than 2%0 within
zone C.
The carbon isotopic composition of the calcite in
zone C is interpreted to represent mixing of carbon
from
two
isotopically
distinct
sources:
primary
marine carbonate with low positive or low negative
values, and an isotopically much lighter carbon,
probably originating as soil-gas CO2, with 8l3C
values around - 20%0. This interpretation fits well
with the evidence of bioclast dissolution prior to
(and probably during) cementation in zone C, which
supplied carbonate of marine origin and isotopic
composition. Dissolved marine carbonate was also
supplied from a high porosity interval at the base
of zone B which suffered only dissolution and no
cementation. The soil profile which supplied the
Stable Isotopes 97
isotopically light carbon is interpreted to have de-
veloped above the high porosity interval at the base
of zone B, and is represented by a kick on the y-ray
log reflecting the concentration of clay minerals
during subaerial exposure. This explanation sug-
gests widespread subaerial exposure of the lime-
stone during a regional or eustatic sea-level faU, and
implies that the same cementation and dissolution
profile should be widespread. Subsequent wells
have shown that this is the case, with distinct carbon
isotopic shifts occurring within zone C (N.L. Turner,
pers. comm., 1991).
4.5 SUlphur
4.5.1 Principles
In diagenetic systems, the isotopic composition
of sulphur yields information about the origin of
sulphate and sulphide cements. In produced fluids,
834S can be used to infer something about the origin
of dissolved sulphate and gaseous H2S (sour gas).
However, the isotope geochemistry of sulphur in
low temperature systems is complex and it is rare
that sulphur isotope data can be used to define
uniquely the origin of a sulphur-bearing compound.
Furthermore, many of the important sulphur iso-
tope fractionation factors are variable or poorly
known. It is this, rather than the separation of pure
phases or analytical precision, that is the limiting
factor in the interpretation of sulphur isotope data.
The complexity of sulphur isotope systematics
stems from the fact that sulphur exists in several
redox states. The mechanisms by which the myriad
sulphur species are converted from one to another
are not fully understood and neither are the isotope
systematics. Nevertheless, a useful generalization is
that large (> 10%0) isotope fractionations occur when
sulphate is converted to reduced sulphur species
(sulphide and elemental sulphur, mainly), whereas
small fractionations (± 5%0) occur amongst reduced
sulphur species and during sulphide oxidation.
Below 200°C, the rate of isotopic exchange be-
tween dissolved sulphate and sulphide is geologically
slow and isotopic equilibrium between the species
is rare (Ohmoto & Lasaga, 1982). Kinetic effects
therefore
dominate
the
isotope
systematics
of
sulphur in sedimentary basins. The main kinetic
isotope effect is associated with the reduction of
sulphate to sulphide, which can be achieved either
chemically, typically above 140°C, or through micro-
bial activity. Experiments at 20-150°C suggest that
the kinetic isotope effect associated with chemical

port of sulphate across the sediment-water inter-
face; its reduction by bacteria, to sulphide and
polysulphide; and the fixation of reduced sulphur
by reaction with detrital iron minerals and organic
matter. The complexities of these processes and the
variable isotope fractionation of the sulphate reduc-
tion step lead to the formation of pyrite with widely
varying isotope ratios, between -50 and +30%0
with most values between - 35 and +10%0 (Kaplan,
1983). A wide range of values (between -17 and
+ 25%0) has also been measured for organically
bound sulphur and the petroleum generated from it
(A.C. Aplin, unpublished data). Highly negative
isotope compositions in pyrite « - 20%0) suggest
that sulphate reduction occurred in an open system
in which sulphate was being transferred across the
sediment-water interface more quickly than it could
be reduced.
In this case the isotope difference
between seawater sulphate and sulphide is similar to
the bacterial kinetic isotope fractionation. More
positive (less negative) values (> -20%0) imply that
sulphate reduction occurred in a system in which
sulphate was reduced more rapidly than it could be
supplied, so that reservoir effects increased the
isotopic composition of both sulphate and sulphide
(see Section 4.2.2). Specific controls on the isotopic
composition of organically bound sulphur are poorly
understood (Mossman et al., 1991).
Some of the sulphur species incorporated into
sediments on deposition participate further in deep
burial diagenetic reactions.
Pyrite
is
essentially
stable below 200°C, but organic sulphur can be
thermally degraded to H2S, and anhydrite or dis-
solved sulphate can be chemically reduced to H2S.
Limited
experimental
work
suggests
that
H2S
generated from organic sulphur may be a few per
mille heavier than the organic sulphur (Krouse
et al., 1987). Data from deeply buried anhydrite-
bearing carbonate reservoirs suggest that the iso-
topic composition of thermochemically derived H2S
is isotopically similar to, or a few per mille lighter
than, the anhydrite (Orr, 1977; Krouse et al., 1988).
This is intriguing because the reaction does not
appear to be controlled by simple kinetic or equili-
brium isotope effects. At 150°C, simple kinetic con-
trols would yield H2S about 15-20%0 lighter than the
sulphate,
whilst equilibrium fractionation
would
give H2S almost 400/00 lighter than the sulphate. The
similarity of the isotopic compositions of sulphate
and sulphide suggests that reduction of anhydrite to
H 2S is a two-stage batch process in which anhydrite
dissolves to give dissolved sulphate (small isotopic

using reducing agents which do not occur naturally.
The isotope systematics of bacterial sulphate reduc-

anoxic marine sediments. Whilst it is clear that

the
extent of fractionation is very variable (Goldhaber
& Kaplan, 1974). Values between 0 and -50%0 have
been measured, although sulphide is commonly 25-
500/00 lighter than precursor sulphate.
Sulphur is incorporated into sedimentary basins
either as sulphate in evaporitic anhydrite, or as
sulphide (pyrite or organically bound) in fine-grained
rocks. The isotopic composition of seawater sulphate
is constant throughout the world's oceans but has
varied between + 10 and + 30%0 through geological
time (Claypool et al., 1980; Fig. 4.21). The sulphur
isotopic composition of evaporitic anhydrite there-
fore has some potential as a stratigraphic tool (cf.
oxygen in marine sulphate, Section 4.3.6).
Pyrite and organic sulphur are incorporated into
sediments during very early diagenesis by the trans-

of data would include: samples of formation water
to check for evidence of sulphate reduction; samples
of organic sulphur to see if the isotopic composition
matches that of the H2S; petrographic studies to
look for signs of calcite replacing anhydrite; and
maximum burial temperature to determine whether
the sediment has reached a temperature high enough
for thermochemical sulphate reduction.
4.5.2 Example 4: thermochemical sulphate
reduction in a carbonate reservoir, deep Foothills
region, Alberta, Canada
HzS concentrations between 4 and 25% occur in
anhydrite-bearing carbonate reservoirs presently at
temperatures up to 175°C in southwestern Alberta
(Krouse et al., 1988). The isotopic composition of 12
samples of H2S was 20.1 ± 1.5%0, compared to a
range of 22.7-33.0%0
for
associated
anhydrite.
Armed with the knowledge that thermochemical
reduction of anhydrite yields H2S with similar iso-
topic compositions to the anhydrite, one would be
tempted to infer a thermochemical origin for the
H2S. However, the possibilities that the HzS was
generated from the thermal degradation of organic
sulphur, or from closed-system bacterial sulphate
reduction, could not be ruled out on the basis of the
isotopic data alone. In this case, there was abundant
geological and geochemical evidence to support a
thermochemical origin. Firstly and most simply, a
petrographic study showed that calcite had replaced
anhydrite according to the general reaction:
CaS04 + CH4 ~ CaC03 + HzS + H20
(21)
Secondly, a strong positive correlation was seen
between the H2S content of the reservoir gas and the
ratio of CO2 to CO2 plus light hydrocarbons (Fig.
4.23, p. 99). This is consistent with the closed-system
destruction of hydrocarbons and the generation of
CO2 and H2S (similar to reaction (21) above, but
with some CO2 remaining in solution). Thirdly, the
isotopic composition of light hydrocarbons increases
with increasing extent of reaction (Fig. 4.24). This
is consistent with the kinetic isotope fractionation
associated with hydrocarbon oxidation in which 12C
hydrocarbons react more rapidly than l3C hydro-
carbons. The isotopic composition of CO2 decreases
with increasing extent of reaction, indicating an
increasing contribution of organic-supplied carbon
to the COz reservoir. Finally, the isotopic composi-
tion of the calcite replacing anhydrite has isotopic
compositions between - 5 and - 300/00, with most
around -20%0 (Fig. 4.23). The more negative values
give a clear indication of an organic source for the
carbon, whilst the heavier values suggest a mixture
of hydrocarbon-derived CO2 and CO2 derived from
the dolomite reservoir rock.

5.1 Introduction
The main use of the natural radioactive decay of
certain elements has been in dating rocks and min-
erals. It is possible to determine radiometric dates
for a number of diagenetic cements, which for some
minerals and under some circumstances can rep-
resent the actual ages of mineral growth. Radio-
metric dating therefore has a clear advantage over
both fluid inclusions and oxygen isotopes as a means
of establishing a quantitative diagenetic history for a
sedimentary rock and integrating diagenesis with
geological history: both fluid inclusions and oxygen
isotope ratios principally provide information about
mineral growth temperatures, and ages must be
derived indirectly, by reference to a modelled thermal
history.
Radiogenic isotopes can provide several other
kinds of information besides age of mineral growth.
Measured dates may not refer to the time of mineral
growth at all. Radiometric systems may be reset so
that a calculated date can represent the age of a phase
of recrystallization or even of a period of fluid move-
ment long after mineral growth. The relative amounts
of certain radiogenic isotopes in minerals and waters
can also be used as natural tracers for monitoring
water-rock interaction and can provide information
about the history of formation water chemistry.
We begin this chapter with a refresher in the
basics of radiometric dating in which we show how
dates are calculated. We then review those isotope
systems that can be used for dating components of
sedimentary rocks and tracing water-rock interac-
tions in sedimentary basins. Theory is kept to a
minimum and enlivened by examples showing the
methods in action. The first technique, K-Ar dating,
is now almost routinely used to date illite cement, to
such an extent that data themselves are sometimes
obscured behind comments such as 'K-Ar ages
show that illite grew about llOMa ago'. We hope
that a run through Section 5.3 will convince the
reader that such conclusions can be drawn only in
certain cases and even then only after much care and
deliberation. The details of 40Ar_ 39Ar dating may
be new to many readers. It is based on the same

The
number of
radiogenic daughter atoms
D*
present at time t is No - N; substituting in equation
(2) gives:
D* = No(1 - e- A1 )
(4)
As No is not usually known in geological systems, it
is more convenient to relate the number of daughter
The nuclei of many elements with large atomic
numbers are unstable and decay naturally into one
or more daughter nuclei. Energy is lost in the form
of some combination of helium nuclei, electrons and
electromagnetic radiation (a, P and y radiation).
The rate of radioactive decay at any particular time
t is proportional to the number of parent atoms
present, N:
where A, the constant of proportionality, is called
the decay constant. Integrating equation (1) gives:
N=No.e- A1
(2)
where No is the number of parent atoms initially
present at t = O. The relationship between Aand the
more familiar half-life, the time it takes for half of
the atoms initially present to decay, may be found
by setting N = No/2:

* Ages calculated assuming an initial ratio are known as
model ages.
This equation is the basis of radiometric dating and
the use of radiogenic isotopes as natural tracers and
can be found in various forms in several places
in this chapter. It can be solved for t which will
represent the age of the system provided that:
1 Ais known;
2 D and N can be accurately measured;
3 all changes in the N/D ratio have been due to
radioactive decay; in other words, the system has
remained closed to both parent and daughter atoms
since t = 0; and
4 Do is known.
Though by no means trivial, the first two assump-
tions are principally analytical problems and need
not detain us here. The degree to which the third
assumption will hold varies in different geological
environments. Argon loss through diffusion can, for
example, be a real problem in K- Ar dating of
minerals that have been subjected to high temperat-
ures, but the amount of loss will depend on the
mineral, partial pressures of Ar in its environment,
and the temperature and duration of heating.
The last assumption is that the number of daughter
nuclei present in the sample before decay began
(Do) is known. In K-Ar dating, equation (6) is
divided by the amount of a non-radiogenic isotope,
36Ar, so Do is represented by the ratio (40Ar;36Ar)0.
Conventional K- Ar dating involves the assumption
that the Ar initially present had the 40Ar;36Ar ratio
of today's atmosphere, 295.5. In Rb-Sr dating, it
is frequently not possible to make a convenient
assumption of this kind, in which case a Rb-Sr date
cannot be calculated from a single analysis: equation
(6) has too many unknowns*. The usual way around
this problem is to construct an isochron diagram.
This involves analysing several cogenetic samples or
subsamples - for example, several minerals from a
rapidly cooled volcanic rock -
and plotting their
parent/daughter ratios (Fig. 5.1). The most familiar

of the number of non-radiogenic daughter nuclei

natural decay as the K-Ar method but has some
tremendous advantages that can be particularly
useful in dealing with diagenetic minerals. Rb-Sr
dating will be most familiar to geology students as a
technique for dating igneous rocks. Its application to
dating diagenetic minerals is in its infancy and has
some problems but we will look at how it can be
applied to illite. The Rb-Sr system has been far
more useful for tracing water-rock interaction and
the chemical evolution of natural waters by monitor-
ing mineral and water Sr isotope ratios. Sr isotope
stratigraphy is a method for dating sedimentary
rocks that relies upon changes in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio
of seawater through time and the retention of the
ratio unmodified in marine carbonate and phos-
phate. We conclude the chapter with brief descrip-
tions of Sm-Nd and U-Th-Pb dating which are
relatively restricted in application but which may be
useful for solving specific problems.

duce a pure separate of the mineral to be dated and
to subsample it. A minimum of a few milligrams is
presently required and precision will be better if
several tens of milligrams or more can be separated.
Potassium content can be determined by a number
of different methods of which emission spectroscopy
and flame photometry are the most popular. The
amount of radiogenic 40Ar is determined by isotope
dilution mass spectrometry. In this technique, the
sample is first preheated in vacuum to drive off
adsorbed atmospheric gases and then fused to
liberate that held in the crystal lattice. To this gas is
added a known amount of another isotope, 38Ar.
After purification, two isotope ratios are measured
by mass spectrometry. The ratio 40ArP8Ar is used
together with the known 38Ar volume to calculate
the total amount of 40Ar in the sample. This is not
however equal to the number that we need to know -
the amount of radiogenic 40Ar. Around 1% of the
atmosphere is 40Ar and no matter how thorough the
preheating, a proportion of the measured 40Ar will
inevitably be of non-radiogenic origin. The amount
of atmospheric 40Ar must therefore be calculated
and subtracted from the measured total. This is
done using the second of the two measured ratios,
36Ar;38Ar. This permits calculation of the amount of
36Ar in the gas sample, all of which is of atmospheric
origin. In the atmosphere, 36Ar is associated with a
known proportion of 40Ar, so the atmospheric ratio
of 40ArP6Ar (295.5) can be used to calculate the
amount of 40Ar that has come from the atmosphere.
The amount of radiogenic 40Ar is then found by
subtracting this amount from the total measured
40Ar. The procedure may be summarized as follows

This is the basic equation of K-Ar dating. The
decay constants and the proportion of 40K in nat-
urally occurring potassium are known (Steiger &
Jager, 1977), so equation (2) permits calculation of
an 'age' provided that the total amounts of K and
radiogenic 40Ar in a sample can be determined and
that certain assumptions are met. In the following
two sections, we will look first at how these two
measurements are made and then at the assump-
tions implicit in the interpretation of a geologically
meaningful age.
40Ar* is the amount of radiogenic 40Ar produced by
decay of 4oK; A is the total decay constant; and Ae
the partial decay constant for 40K to
40Ar decay.
Equation 7 can expressed in the form:
5.3.2 Analytical methods: precision and accuracy
Calculation of the K-Ar age of a sample requires
two separate measurements: the amounts of K and
radiogenic 40Ar. The first stage is therefore to pro-
method to work, all the samples or subsamples must
be of the same age, must have had the same initial
ratio (87Sr/86Sr)0 and must of course have a range of
parent/daughter (Rb/Sr) ratios.
Potassium-40 undergoes natural radioactive decay,
88.8% to 40Ca and the remaining 11.2% to 40Ar
with a half-life of 1.250 x 109 years (Dalrymple &
Lanphere, 1969; Faure, 1986). Although both decay
series can be used for dating, the K-Ca method
is plagued by interferences from non-radiogenic
naturally occurring Ca isotopes, and we will not
consider it further. The accumulation of radiogenic
40Ar in a K-bearing mineral as a function of time (t)
is given by:
4OAr* = ~e • 40K (eAt - 1)

with only 2% of a 450 Ma old detrital muscovite,
the measured age would be about 59 Ma (Hamilton
et at., 1989; Fig. 5.2). The precision of the age
might easily be as good as ± 1 or 2 Ma (about 2-4%)
but the precise age is wrong by nearly 20%. The
older the contaminating phase, the worse the prob-
lem will be. Other possible contaminants are soluble
K-bearing salts derived from formation water which
can precipitate in the pores of subsurface samples as
they dry. These salts may be extremely difficult to
remove from mineral separates, even with copious
washing.
There is no easy solution to the difficulties of
preparing a pure, uncontaminated mineral separate.
The best way to minimize contamination is to avoid
samples with large amounts of detrital K-bearing
minerals or that contain more than one generation
of the authigenic mineral to be dated. To recognize
contamination, there is no real substitute for actually
looking at the sample under TEM and analysing
selected grains if necessary (Section 2.6). XRD
is not capable of detecting contaminants if they
are present in amounts of less than a few per cent
(Section 2.7). The example given above shows that
smaller amounts of old minerals can cause highly
inaccurate age determinations. Finally, if, as is com-
mon, contamination is likely to be a problem, it is

No K- or Ar-bearing contaminants
In order to prepare a sample of any diagenetic
mineral large enough for K and Ar analysis, it will
be necessary to crush a whole rock sample and
isolate the mineral to be dated in some way. It is
often difficult to exclude other minerals completely
from the separate and if these contain K, as will
detrital illite, micas and feldspars, there will be an
error in the measured age. The error can be very
serious indeed. For example, if a separate consisting
largely of 50 Ma old authigenic illite is contaminated
probability that the age calculated is within the
quoted range. But how accurate is it? Good precision
is a prerequisite for accuracy but it certainly does
not guarantee it.
Accuracy may be thought of as having two com-
ponents. Analytical accuracy is the extent to which
the determination is a true reflection of the K and
40Ar contents of the sample. This will depend on any
systematic bias involved in the measurements and
particularly on sample homogeneity. K and
40Ar
analyses have to be performed on separate sub-
samples and if these are not homogeneous with
respect to both, the precision of the age will be
substantially
less
than
the
analytical
accuracy.
Neither good precision nor analytical accuracy are
however enough to guarantee that the calculated
age will be an accurate reflection of what we would
like to think we are dating, usually mineral growth.
This may be described as geological accuracy and is
ultimately what is of greatest concern. It depends on
the validity of a number of assumptions that are
implicit in the K-Ar dating method, many of which
need to be evaluated separately for different min-
erals in different geological environments. These are
the subject of the following section.
5.3.3 Assumptions
Equation 8 can be used to calculate a true age of
mineral growth only if a number of criteria are
fulfilled:
1 the sample to be dated must be free from recently
introduced K- or Ar-bearing contaminants;
2 there has been no gain or loss of either K or 40Ar*
since the mineral grew other than by in-situ decay;
3 all non-radiogenic 40Ar -
that not produced by
in-situ decay of 40K - is of atmospheric origin and
has the 4oArp6Ar ratio of today's atmosphere; and
4 potassium in the sample must have 'normal' iso-
topic composition.

diffusion kinetics relies on the use of muscovite as an
analogue (Hamilton et al., 1989). Figure 5.3 shows
temperatures required to cause age reductions of 1,
10 and 100% as a function of illite crystal size,
assuming a heating period of 100 Ma. Heating a
typical illite fibre O.lllm wide to 180°C causes an age
reduction of about 15%. This figure is comparable
to an independent estimate obtained by evaluating
the reduction in age as a function of depth (temperat-
ure) of detrital illites in Plio-Pleistocene sediments
(Glasmann, 1987). It appears then that Ar loss may
be responsible for limited age reduction in diagenetic
illites but that the effect is likely to be serious only
under the most extreme diagenetic conditions.
Finally, sylvite. Though it has a high K content, it
dissolves and reprecipitates with such alacrity that it
does not retain Ar and gives erroneously young ages
(Dalrymple & Lanphere, 1969). Neither sylvite nor
other K-bearing evaporite minerals are suitable for
K-Ar dating.

important not to overestimate the accuracy of a set
of data.
No gain or loss ofAr or K
Potassium gain or loss is only likely during recrystal-
lization which would in any case involve loss of Ar
and resetting of the K- Ar clock. Argon loss or gain
is of greater concern. In a subsiding sedimentary
basin,
authigenic minerals
are
characteristically
subjected to temperatures above those at which they
grew, for substantial periods. Diffusion is highly
sensitive to temperature so it is important to con-
sider the extent to which 40Ar may diffuse into or
out of minerals. Diffusion of 40Ar into a mineral
from surrounding pore fluid is unlikely because rela-
tively high partial pressures of Ar would need to be
maintained in the fluid. Loss of 40Ar is a more
serious concern and would lead to a reduction in the
apparent age. If all 40Ar is lost, the K- Ar clock
will be reset and the age will measure the time of
resetting. If 40Ar loss is partial, the geological sig-
nificance of the measured age will be difficult to
interpret (Damon, 1970).
There are two approaches to evaluating Ar dif-
fusion: studies of natural systems that have been
heated and calibration of kinetics by means of
experimental work. In a study of the ages of several
minerals as a function of distance from an igneous
intrusion, K-feldspar was the most susceptible to
Ar loss and still showed significant reductions in
measured age nearly 7 km from the intrusion (Hart,
1964). Orthoclase and microcline are in fact gener-
ally considered unsuitable for K- Ar dating because
of their poor Ar retention, even at low temperatures
(Dalrymple
&
Lanphere,
1969).
Sanidine
does
retain Ar and can be used to date volcanic rocks.
However, this somewhat bleak picture may be overly
pessimistic. Low temperature K-feldspar, usually
described as adularia, may retain Ar better than
orthoclase and
microcline.
Girard et al.
(1988)
estimated
an
age of 98 ± 16 Ma for
authigenic
feldspar in Lower Cretaceous sandstones, consistent
with petrographic evidence for the age of the min-
eral. Had the feldspar lost a large proportion of its
40Ar, its apparent age ought to have been close
to zero.
Studies of Ar retention in illite are more encourag-
ing. The ages of illite separates from a shale intruded
by a small Tertiary stock in New Mexico proved to
be older than the stock itself, even at distances of
only a few feet from the contact (Aronson & Lee,
1986). This suggests that illite is capable of retaining

Potassium has normal isotopic ratio
The amount of 40K in a sample is calculated from the
total K-content and an assumed 4oK/K ratio of 1.167
x 10-4• Nonetheless, a small amount of natural
fractionation of K isotopes due to their differences
in mass is to be expected. There would be some
associated effect on decay constants. Fortunately,
even a substantial amount of fractionation will not
introduce a serious error: a 5% (500/00) reduction in
4OK/K will decrease a 100 Ma age by only 0.1%
(Hamilton et al., 1989).
On a plot of 40Arm;36Ar against 4oK/36Ar, this is the
equation of a straight line with intercept 40Arx;36Ar
and slope proportional to age. If the intercept of a
line passing through data with different 4OK;36Ar
ratios is not equal to the atmospheric ratio, excess
Ar is present. The slope of the line through the
data may however not represent a true age because
4OK;36Ar depends not only on K-content but also on
the (variable) amount of atmospheric 36Ar con-
tamination in the sample. The interpretation of the
diagram in terms of age also assumes that there has
been no diffusive Ar loss.

same age, given by the slopes of the isochrons OB and XA.
However, samples A contain excess Ar. Their individual
K- Ar ages will be quite different, proportional to the
slopes of the lines OAb OAz etc., and all will overestimate
the true age.

40Armis the total measured 40Ar and 40Arx is the
non-radiogenic component. Whatever its origin -
included into the mineral as it grew, adsorbed onto
the mineral as it languished in the core store or
during sample preparation, or adsorbed onto the
analytical equipment - it is assumed that 40Arx has
the isotopic composition of the atmosphere so that
a correction can be applied using the amount of
measured 36Ar and the atmospheric 40Ar;36Ar ratio
(295.5). If the mineral being dated at any time
incorporates 40Ar from a non-atmospheric source
(excess argon) the measured K- Ar age will be older
than the true age.
The calculation of a single age provides no infor-
mation about the presence or absence of excess Ar.
In the absence of a reliable independent estimate
of the age of the dated mineral, the best way of
trying to detect it is by plotting data from a num-
ber of cagenetic samples on an isochron diagram
(Shafiqullah & Damon, 1974). We will look at two
kinds. The first involves plotting 40Ar* against 4oK.
40Ar* is calculated assuming that all non-radiogenic
40Ar is atmospheric. If this is true, points represent-
ing samples with different 40K contents will lie on a
straight line passing through the origin: no 4OK, no
40Ar*. The slope of the line will be proportional to
the true age. If the mineral contains excess argon,
the points will plot on a line with a positive intercept
on the 40Ar* axis (Fig. 5.4). The true age is still
proportional to the slope of the line through the
data, but the ages of individual samples calculated
assuming that no excess argon is present will be too
old. In order to generate a diagram of this kind, it is
necessary to have dated at least three cogenetic
samples with different K-contents. With igneous
rocks, this would be accomplished by dating dif-
ferent minerals. In sedimentary rocks, it is usually
difficult even to identify cogenetic minerals, let
alone separate three that contain K for dating. We
must rely on samples of a single mineral having
variable K-content. As we will see in the example
below, there does seem to be enough variability
in illite K-content to make this approach possible,
though the reasons why this should be so are not
known.

ematically similar

5.3.4 Example 1: illite cement in aeolian sandstone,
Rotliegend Group, Southern North Sea
This example involves the assessment of a set of
K- Ar ages measured on illite separates from the
Lower Leman Sandstone of the Permian Rotliegend
Group in the Village Fields area of the Southern
North Sea. The Lower Leman Sandstone includes
aeolian and fluvial sands and interbedded siltstones
and mudstones. Illite occurs as a late, pore-bridging
cement (Fig. 5.5). In this section, we are concerned
with the validity of the K-Ar ages of these illites.
There are two key questions: are the fundamental
assumptions of K-Ar dating met and if so, what do
the ages represent?
Samples of core were collected from 11 wells in the
area, exclusively from aeolian intervals (Robinson
et al., 1993). Aeolian. sands frequently contain no
detrital illite and it was hoped that illite separates
would be free from contamination with any older
material (Lee, 1984). Those samples with most illite
cement were identified using SEM, and clay separ-
ates were prepared from
them by centrifuging
gently disaggregated rock in acetone (Brindley,
1981). Purity was monitored by XRD and by visual
examination using TEM. Organic matter was re-
moved by ashing in a low-temperature oxygen
plasma but no chemical pre-treatment was used.
Finally, the separates were subsampled for K and Ar
analysis. The ages are listed in Table 5.1. Analytical
precision is quoted as ± 20" and does not take into
account possible sample inhomogeneity.
The requirements for plausible ages are:
1 the samples must be free of K- or Ar-bearing
minerals other than the illite cement to be dated;
2 the illite must have remained a closed system with
respect to K and Ar since it grew; and
3 all

the
sample must have the isotopic composition of the
present-day atmosphere.
Detrital illite present in amounts below the detec-
tion limit of XRD can easily lead to measured ages
substantially older than that of illite cement growth.
It is generally coarser than illite cement and con-
centrates in the coarser separates. In samples where
contamination is a problem, these have older ages.
The ages of the Village Fields illites show just such a
pattern (Fig. 5.6). There are however two reasons
why the apparent increase in age in the coarser
dated separates is unlikely to be due to contamina-
tion in this particular case. Firstly, we attempted to
minimize contamination by judicious sample selec-
tion and examination of the separates using TEM.
Those selected for dating contained no identifiable
detrital illite or other K-bearing minerals. Secondly,
the ages of the coarsest (> 5 11m) fractions are only
around 10% older than those of the finest. Con-
tamination commonly leads to very substantial

been subjected to temperatures as high as 190°C.
Estimates of Ar diffusion kinetics suggest that this
might lead to age reduction due to Ar loss of up to a
few per cent for illite crystals of normal size (Fig.
5.3). This is a possible explanation for the observa-
tion that the finest dated size fractions have the
youngest ages (Fig. 5.6): the finest illite will have the
greatest surface area/volume ratio and will as a
consequence be most susceptible to diffusive Ar
loss. If however diffusion had caused significant
age reduction, measured age might be expected to
correlate with maximum burial temperature and
thus with estimated maximum burial depth. No such
correlation is evident (Fig. 5.7).
The
last
major
assumption
is
that
all
non-
radiogenic 40Ar has atmospheric isotopic composi-
tion. Figure 5.8 shows the illite data from the Village
Fields area plotted on a graph of 40Ar* against 4OK,
one of the isochron diagrams described above (data
in Table 5.2). At the 90% confidence level, the
unweighted least squares regression line through
the data passes through the origin. At the 95%
confidence interval, however, the intercept 40Ar0 is
greater than zero, hinting at the presence of excess
Ar. The isochron age calculated from the least
squares regression line is 138 Ma (Early Cretaceous).
The best interpretation is probably that to a first
approximation the assumption is true, but that the
presence of a small proportion of excess Ar cannot
be ruled out. That the line passes close to the origin
is also in fact further evidence against diffusive Ar
loss since uniform loss of 40Ar* will produce a negat-
ive intercept on the graph (Shafiqullah & Damon,
1974).
Figure 5.9 shows the same data plotted on the
second type of isochron diagram, 40Armp6Ar against
4OK;36Ar. The regression line does pass through the
atmospheric 40Ar;36Ar ratio at the 90% confidence
level but closer scrutiny of the diagram ought to
raise doubts about the significance of this observa-
tion. The regression line is dominated by one point
with a high 4oK;36Ar in excess of 120000. This
number is high because the sample had a small
atmospheric Ar contamination and therefore a low
36Ar content and consequent high 4OK;36Ar ratio. In
fact, the spread of data on the diagram is largely due

to variable atmospheric contamination (Fig. 5.10).
This means that the 'isochron' is largely a mixing
line with at best cryptic age significance.
It seems then that the Village Fields data do
largely meet the assumptions of K-Ar dating and
that they are telling us something about when illite
cement grew in the Lower Leman Sandstones. But
exactly what are they telling us? Even if illite grows
over a geologically long period, we will still measure
a single K-Ar date which may represent some form
of average age. Authigenic illite crystals tend to have
relatively large cores and finer, hairy outgrowths
(Lee et al., 1985; Fig. 5.5). It might be expected that
the cores - which must be older -
would lead to
older ages in coarser separates. In this example, this
does not appear to be the case suggesting that the
duration of illite growth in a sample is of the same
order as, or less than, the precision of the method.
This may not be true in all cases. As we will see in
the next example, a pattern of increasing age in
coarser separates may also result from contamina-
tion by detrital material and it will usually be dif-
ficult to disentangle the two effects. In such cases, a
measured age will probably be biased towards the
latest time of illite growth (Hamilton et al., 1992).

ages are associated with lower ratios characteristic
of phengitic micas. It is possible to calculate a
regression line for the ages and calculate where
the slope and associated confidence intervals meet
the range of TEM authigenic illite analyses. This
suggests an age between 50 and 72 Ma and, though
not particularly rigorous, does give some idea as to
the uncertainty involved.
5.3.6 Example 3: K-feldspar cement, offshore
Angola
Just as it is very difficult to isolate a separate of pure
authigenic illite from a rock sample that contains
detrital illite, it is next to impossible to obtain tens of
milligrams of authigenic K-feldspar free from con-
tamination by detrital orthoclase or microcline. The
only viable approach is to try to produce separates
with a variable proportion of detrital to authigenic
material, quantify how much of each is present
and then calculate the age of the end-members by
extrapolation. Girard et al. (1988) have done this
for Lower Cretaceous sandstones from offshore
Angola. They first produced feldspar separates
comprising grains and overgrowths by standard
methods like heavy liquids and the ever popular
hand-picking. The separates were then etched in
acid. The hope was that the grain-overgrowth
boundary would be weakened so that when the
separates were then shattered ultrasonically, the fine

high enough to cause any significant diffusive loss of
Ar (which might reduce measured ages), so the most
straightforward interpretation would be that the
youngest ages are close to, but older than, the true
age of illite cement growth. But how much older? In
order to calculate isotopic ratio end-members, we
tried an approach involving a visual estimate of
the proportion of authigenic illite in each analysed
separate (Section 4.3.4). An alternative approach is
to use some chemical discriminant. Figure 5.12 is a
plot of K-Ar age against Al/K ratio. Also plotted
on the figure is the average (± 20') of AUK ratios for
individual diagenetic illite fibres from the same
samples, analysed using TEM. The separates with
the youngest ages have AUK ratios close to the
diagenetic illite value of 2.18 ± 0.08*. The older

overgrowths would fly off and be collected by siev-
ing (the same technique sometimes used to isolate
samples of quartz cement for isotopic analysis; see
Section 4.3.2). The detrital feldspar luminesced
but the overgrowths did not, so the proportion of
detrital to authigenic material could be estimated
visually using a standard CL microscope. In this
study, this was done by point-counting, though
image analysis potentially offers greater accuracy
(Hearn, 1987).
This is undeniably a laborious procedure requir-
ing samples that contain a large amount of authigenic
feldspar (which is rather unusual) as well as sub-
stantial care. It does nonetheless appear to work.
Girard et ai. ended up with an age of 98 ± 16 Ma for
the feldspar cement, in accord with the inference
that cement growth pre-dated compaction. The
detrital end-member age of 516 ± 16 Ma was close
to the age of the basement in the area. Like the
method we used for dating the Brent illite, it in-
volves the assumption that all detrital and all authi-
genic feldspar can be characterized by single ages.
5.4.1 Principles
4oAr_39Ar dating is closely related to K-Ar dating
and is based on the same natural decay of 40K to
40Ar (Dalrymple & Lanphere, 1971). It involves the
conversion by irradiation of a proportion of one of
the naturally occurring isotopes of K, 39K, into an
isotope of Ar that does not occur in nature, 39Ar.
39Ar is then a measure of the original K content of
the sample and an age can be calculated from the
measurement of a single isotopic ratio, 40ArP9Ar.

*J can be an important source of error as many reactors
have severe flux gradients.
A number of Ar isotopes are in fact formed by
irradiation of K, Ca and CI and these must be
corrected for (Brereton, 1970), but a serious error is
likely only in samples that are very young « 1Ma)
or that have a higher Ca than K content.

Note the similarity to equation (8). Just as in K-Ar
dating, the radiogenic component, 40Ar*;39Ar, must
be calculated from the measured 40Ar;39Ar by sub-
tracting a non-radiogenic component assumed to

to calculate from first principles so standards of
known age are placed in the reactor and used to
monitor the flux. Argon is released from sample and
flux monitors by fusion and Ar isotope ratios are
measured by mass spectrometry. A factor known as
J is then calculated from the ages and 40Ar;39Ar
ratios of the standards and is used to determine the
age of the samples*:
This is the key difference between 4oAr_39Ar and
K-Ar dating. The calculation of a single age in this
manner nonetheless involves making exactly the
same assumptions as in K- Ar dating: that there has
been no Ar loss since mineral growth and that all
non-radiogenic 40Ar is of atmospheric origin (no
excess Ar). However, 4oAr_39Ar dating can have
advantages over the K- Ar method.
1 All of the information needed to calculate an age
can be obtained from a single aliquot of gas released
from a single sample as small as 1Jlg, by heating or
total fusion. K-Ar ages require separate determina-
tion of K content and Ar isotope concentrations so
that sample heterogeneity will introduce an error.
2 Gas to be dated may be released by laser fusion so
that individual mineral grains may be dated.
3 Under some circumstances, it is possible to correct
for the effects of Ar loss.
4 It is sometimes possible to identify the presence of
excess Ar from one sample because an isochron can
be produced from a single sample (its identification
on a K- Ar isochron diagram requires a suite of data
from cogenetic samples).
The first stage is irradiation of the sample in a
nuclear reactor. An amount of 39Ar is formed that
depends on the amount of 39K (and therefore total
K), the length of irradiation, the neutron flux and
the capture cross section. The last two are difficult

116 Chapter 5
Fig. 5.13 Idealized 40Ar_ 39Ar age spectrum produced by
step heating. The width of the boxes parallel to the age axis
indicates precision. Gas released at low temperatures
comes from less Ar-retentive sites and is younger than the
plateau age. This sample has lost Ar by diffusion. Its total
fusion 40Ar_ 39Ar and K-Ar ages will be younger than the
true age. Note that the plateau age may still underestimate
the true age if Ar has been lost uniformly from the more
retentive sites.
If all argon is released by completely melting a
sample, the measured 40Ar_ 39Ar age (total release
age) is equivalent to the K-Ar age. However, it is
also possible to release aliquots of gas sequentially
by heating at progressively higher temperatures and
to measure an age for each. This is known as step
heating. If there has been no Ar loss, the ages of all
the gas aliquots should be the same and equal to the
K-Ar age. If, however, Ar has been preferentially
lost from certain sites in the mineral, there will be a
spectrum of ages. The most common pattern, and
the easiest to interpret, is illustrated in Fig. 5.13.
Gas released at low temperature has young ages
because it comes from less retentive sites and from
the mineral surface from which Ar is most likely to
have been lost. Gas aliquots released at higher tem-
peratures from more retentive sites tend towards a
constant plateau age which is a minimum estimate
of, and frequently close to, the true age of closure.
In such cases, the total release and K-Ar ages will
be younger than the plateau age. It is also common
to observe anomalously old ages in the gas driven off
at low temperature. This may indicate the presence
of excess Ar or loss of K. We will look at an example
of such a pattern below when we discuss 40Ar_ 39Ar
dating of chlorite cement.
One further variant of the
40Ar- 39Ar method
-,-----
Total release 40 Ar- 39 Ar
and K-Ar ages
5.4.2 Example 4: chlorite cement, Triassic, Central
North Sea
In this example, we will look at an attempt to date
authigenic chlorite by means of the
40Ar_ 39Ar
method. Chlorite usually contains a small amount
of K «
1%) even though there is no site in the
lattice which it can occupy (Whittle, 1985). Chlorite
separates were prepared by disaggregation of sand-
stone cores followed by repeated high gradient
magnetic separation. Purity was checked by XRD
analysis and visual inspection using TEM. All step
heating profiles show a characteristic saddle shape,
with ages considerably older than the Triassic de-
positional age of the sandstones at both low and high
temperature ends (Fig. 5.14). A similar profile has
been observed for other minerals (Harrison
&
McDougall,
1981;
Zeitler
&
Fitzgerald,
1986).
There is no clear plateau age although the minimum
ages are reasonably consistent, between 65 and 41
Ma (average 52 ±9 Ma), and compatible with a
K-Ar age of 74 ± 3Ma measured on a mixed layer
illite-smectite cement that appears on
textural
grounds to pre-date chlorite.
In the
absence of contamination
by another
K-bearing phase, there are at least two possible
explanations for the saddle-shaped spectra. Excess
40Ar may be present in both the least and most
retentive sites so that the gas given off at high
involves releasing gas for dating by means of a laser
(York et al., 1981). The method has enormous
potential because it removes the need to prepare a
pure mineral separate: the laser can be directed at
individual grains and analyses obtained from spots
only a few tens of micrometres across. We will look
below at how this method has been used to date
feldspar overgrowths.
Although there are some
problems, laser 40Ar_ 39Ar dating does seem to have
a bright future for dating not only authigenic, but
also detrital minerals.
There is one problem sometimes associated with
40Ar- 39Ar dating that we must consider before
looking at some examples: the phenomenon of
argon
recoil
(Turner
&
Cadogan,
1974).
This
happens during irradiation when 39K is lost due to
the emission of protons to form 39Ar. Recoil affects
a surface layer of the order of O.8llm thick and is
therefore likely to be a particular hazard with fine-
grained minerals. It leads to erroneously old and
meaningless ages. We will encounter the problem of
recoil in two of the examples below.

The profiles show a characteristic saddle shape. Interpretation of a meaningful age is not straightforward.
and low temperatures gives anomalously old ages.
Alternatively, there may have been loss of 39Ar in
the reactor (recoil) from most and least retentive
sites. Though corrections could be applied to com-
pensate for recoil or excess Ar, it is at present
difficult to interpret a geologically meaningful age
from profiles such as these. More needs to be known
about where K is held in the chlorite lattice and how
it is released on heating. Note however that total
release 4OAr- 39Ar and K-Ar ages -
weighted
averages of the step heating profile ages -
would

5.4.3 Example 5: illite cement in aeolian sandstone,
Rotliegend Group, Southern North Sea
40Ar_ 39Ar step heating profiles may sometimes be
capable of identifying and correcting for Ar loss or
the presence of excess Ar. Might it then be a better
method than K-Ar dating for dating illite? Figure
5.15 shows a step heating age spectrum from one of

the Lower Leman Sandstone (Rotliegend Group),

of 217 Ma. Both are older than the K- Ar age of
155 ± 3Ma.

118 Chapter 5
the samples of illite cement from the Rotliegend
Group of the Southern North Sea (Section 5.3.4).
There is a fairly well defined plateau at about 240 Ma
and the total release age is 217 Ma. However, both
are much older than the K-Ar age, 155 ± 3Ma.
This is almost certainly due to approximately uni-
form loss of
39Ar from all sites through recoil
(confirmed by the loss of about 2% K during irradia-
tion). In this case, 40Ar_ 39Ar step heating cannot
provide a meaningful age. Recoil is likely to be a
common problem in dating illites because of their
fine grain size (Reuter & Dallmeyer, 1987). How-
ever, Bray et al. (1987) found that the K-Ar and
40Ar_ 39Ar ages of illite cements from Proterozoic
sandstones in Saskatchewan were concordant. They
ascribed the lack of recoil to their having left the
samples as aggregates. Presumably, 39Ar lost from
the illite structure was retained in between grains or
adsorbed onto surfaces.
5.4.4 Example 6: K-feldspar overgrowths
Two approaches
have
been
taken
to
applying
40Ar_ 39Ar dating to K-feldspar overgrowths. One is
to separate bulk samples of feldspar and perform
step heating; the other is to use a laser to analyse
individual overgrowths. In the first method, step
heating profiles are measured for two feldspar
fractions (Hearn & Sutter, 1985). One fraction has
grains and overgrowths intact and a second com-
prises only detrital feldspar from which overgrowths
have been removed by acid dissolution. The age
spectrum of the overgrowths is then calculated
from the mass fraction of overgrowths in the mixed
sample as estimated using CL methods (see Section
5.3.6). Hearn et al. (1987) applied this technique to
authigenic feldspars in Cambrian carbonates in the
Appalachians. The synthetic age spectrum that they
calculated for authigenic feldspar had a well defined
plateau age at about 300 Ma with young ages at low
release temperatures and old ages at high release
temperatures. This suggests that K-Ar ages and
total release
40Ar_ 39Ar ages may not correctly
measure the age of authigenic feldspar.
Feldspar overgrowths can also be dated by laser
fusion. Though in principle there is no reason why the
laser cannot generate step heating profiles, in prac-
tice most such ages are total release ages simply
because tiny overgrowths do not produce enough
gas for several age determinations. Figure 5.16

their precision is poor (because of the minute

Other
studies
have
encountered
similar problems (e.g. Walgenwitz et al., 1990). The
variability and old ages are probably due to release
of gas from adjacent detrital feldspars which is hard
to avoid and which makes interpretation of the true
age of the overgrowths very difficult.

The abundance of 87Sr is usually measured and

or mineral, this 87Sr/86Sr ratio will increase with time
by an amount proportional to the 87Rb/86Sr ratio of
the material and to the time elapsed, such that:
5.5.2 Analytical methods
Rb-Sr dating requires two analyses: 87Sr/86Sr and
Rb/Sr ratios. The first step in measuring 87Sr/86Sr is
to pre-concentrate the Sr from the sample and to
separate it from Rb (87Rb will interfere with 87Sr
during mass spectrometry). This is usually achieved
by complete dissolution of the sample followed by
an ion-exchange treatment. The Sr separate is then
analysed by thermal ionization mass spectrometry
(TIMS). Precision is monitored in two ways. Internal
precision is calculated as the standard deviation
(some quote standard error, i.e. cr/Vn) of the
results obtained for a number of analytical cycles
during the analysis of a single sample. External pre-
cision, a better measure of sample reproducibility,
is the standard deviation of repeat analyses of a
standard over a long period of time. Accuracy is
monitored by regular analysis of a standard (this
also facilitates interlaboratory calibration). Common
Sr standards are: NBS 987 (87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.71025);
Eimer and Amend (0.70800) and Holocene marine
carbonate (HMC; 0.70920).
Rb/Sr ratios may be measured by XRF if large
enough samples are available (Pankhurst & O'Nions,
an isochron (Fig. 5.1). The age (t) of the samples is
related to the gradient of the isochron:
gradient = eAt - 1
(14)
Isochron dating is especially useful because I(Sr)
does not need to be known, but can rather be
calculated from the intercept of the isochron on the
87Sr/86Sr axis, fitted to data using least squares
regression (York, 1969). As well as calculating con-
fidence limits on the age and I(Sr), most isochron-
fitting
packages
calculate
the
mean
square
of
weighted deviates (MSWD). This is a 'quality of
fit' parameter; values greater than 2.5 indicate scatter
in the data above that which would be expected
from random analytical error. This would indicate
that the assumptions of the isochron method have
not been met. In some cases, Rb-Sr isochron dating
may provide useful information even if the closed
system assumption is not met. If the system to be
dated has become 'open' with respect to Rb or
Sr over a geologically short time period, related
perhaps to a specific geological event (e.g. local
heating), then the Rb-Sr clock may be completely
reset and the isochron method may be used to date
the event rather than the original age of the samples
(Morton & Long, 1984).

This allows the rock or mineral to be dated by solv-

tions (discussed below) are met.
Rb and Sr behave quite differently geochemically
because Rb is an alkali element and Sr an alkaline
earth. As a consequence, different materials can
have vastly differing Rb/Sr ratios, from less than
0.01 for a carbonate to in excess of 100 for a mica. If
a cogenetic suite of samples has a range of Rb/Sr
ratios, provided that all had the same initial ratio
and have remained closed to Rb and Sr since their
formation, their 87Sr/86Sr and 87Rb/86Sr will plot on

of highly sensitive mass spectrometers means that
individual pellets can now be hand-picked and
grouped according to pellet morphology or degree
of mineralogical evolution (higher-K pellets are
darker in colour) so that isochrons can be developed
for individual samples (Fig. 5.17). Ideally, biogenic
marine carbonate from the same sample should also
be analysed. Carbonate minerals have extremely
low Rb/Sr ratios, so their 87Sr/86Sr ratios do not
change through time and should be equivalent to
glauconite I(Sr). The glauconite isochron age can
confidently be assumed to be the age of sedimenta-
tion if:
1 measurements from different types of glauconite
fall on a single isochron (this indicates initial isotopic,
homogeneity) ;
2 biogenic carbonate from the sample plots on the
same isochron; and
3 the 87Sr/86Sr of the carbonate is that of con-
temporaneous
seawater
(Smalley
&
Rundberg,
1991).
In several studies,
glauconite separates have
been found to lie on isochrons defining ages much
younger than the known sedimentary age of the host
rocks, and with I(Sr) values significantly different
from contemporaneous seawater (Laskowski et al.,
1980; Morton & Long, 1984; Smalley et al., 1988).
In each of these cases, comparison of the isochron
age with basin history suggests that ages have been
reset by exchange of Sr between the different glau-
conite types during times of uplift and emergence

1973). More usually, with small diagenetic mineral
samples, Rb and Sr concentrations are analysed
by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Usually a
'spike', a solution containing known amounts of Rb
and Sr that have been artificially enriched in the
minor isotopes 87Rb and 84Sr, is added to a known
weight of sample prior to dissolution. The spike
isotopes homogenize with the sample during dissolu-
tion. Both Rb and Sr are then separated by ion
chromatography and analysed by mass spectrometry.
5.5.3 Rb-Sr dating ofclay minerals
In principle, several clay minerals may be dated
by the Rb-Sr method. These include glauconite
(Morton
&
Long,
1984), illite
(Kralik,
1984),
kaolinite and smectite (Emery et al., 1987). In par-
ticular the K-bearing (and thus Rb-rich) clay min-
erals glauconite and illite can potentially be dated
very precisely. The main problem lies in knowing
exactly what is being dated. Clay minerals are com-
plicated Rb-Sr systems because they contain two
types of Rb and Sr: structural (incorporated within
the mineral lattice) and loosely bound (adsorbed
onto grain surfaces). There is debate as to whether
the loosely bound ions constitute simply troublesome
contaminants which must be removed (Morton,
1983) or whether they are better considered as a
different part of the clay which may nevertheless
remain closed to Rb and Sr and thus contain chrono-
logical information. In the first case, an ion-exchange
treatment can be used to strip the exchangeable
material from the clay, the leachate thrown away
and the stripped residue analysed. In the second
case, the isotopic analysis of the leachate can provide
a' point on a leachate-residue, two-point 'isochron'
(e.g. Ohr et al., 1991).
Most published Rb-Sr data refer to glauconite.
Glauconitic minerals are a family of Fe, K-bearing
clay minerals, of which glauconite S.s. is an end
member which characteristically occurs as pelletal
grains in marine sediments. The pellets form by
glauconitization of a pre-existing substrate material
at or very close to the sediment-water interface
and are thought to evolve gradually towards more
potassic compositions over a period of 104_105 years
(Odin & Matter, 1981). Glauconite dating (K-Ar
and Rb-Sr) has thus been exploited as a means of
calibrating the geological time scale (Odin, 1982).
Glauconitic pellets may be readily separated from
the other grains of a disaggregated sandstone using
,an electromagnetic separator. The development

above sea level, possibly in response to meteoric
water flushing (Morton & Long, 1984). This indicates
that Rb-Sr glauconite dates can potentially be used
to date diagenesis associated with meteoric water
flushing.
5.5.4 Example 7: illite cement in aeolian sandstone,
Rotliegend Group, Southern North Sea
In Section 5.3.4 we presented a number of K-Ar
ages of illite cements from aeolian sandstones of the
Permian Rotliegend Group in the Southern North
Sea. These appear largely to fulfil the assumptions
of the K- Ar method and show a degree of con-
sistency over a large area and depth range, both of
which suggest that the K- Ar ages actually date illite
growth. Two of these samples were selected for
Rb-Sr analysis in an attempt to obtain concordant
Rb-Sr ages. Different size fractions dominated by
clay minerals were separated by centrifugation and
checked for purity in the now familiar manner.
Kaolinite dominated in the coarser fractions separ-
ated from sample A; those from B were dominated
by illite but contained persistent minor chlorite.
This was partially removed by using a high-gradient
Radiogenic Isotopes 121
magnetic separation technique (Russell et al., 1984),
but remained as a minor contaminant. Each of the
clay fractions was leached in IN ammonium acetate
to extract loosely bound Rb and Sr. Leachates and
residues were then analysed separately for Rb and
Sr concentrations using isotope dilution, and for
87Sr/86Sr. Results are listed in Table 5.4.
Figure 5.18 shows isochron diagrams for the
leachate-residue pairs.
Two subsamples of the
< 2 Jlm fraction of sample A gave similar two-point
'isochron' ages of 140 and 143 Ma but a third was
dated at 170 Ma. Illite K- Ar ages for 4817b-3 range
from 145 to 158Ma (Table 5.1). At least two of the
subsamples are therefore extremely close to having
concordant K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages. The reason why
the third subsample has an older Rb-Sr age is not
known.
Perhaps the < 2 Jlm fraction is hetero-
geneous, with the 170 Ma aliquot containing a small
amount ofold contaminant. The kaolinite-dominated
5-10 Jlm fraction yielded a date of 157 Ma, again
within the range of the K- Ar ages. The illite-
rich fraction from sample B (0.5-0.2 Jlm) yielded
an isochron age of 164 Ma, while the chlorite-rich
fraction
(2-5 Jlm
magnetic)
gave
153 Ma.

5.5.5 Sr isotope stratigraphy
Sr isotope stratigraphy is a method for dating marine
sediments which is being used increasingly as a
supplement to biostratigraphic dating, over which it
can have certain advantages. Firstly, it is a numerical
method with quantifiable uncertainties and high
resolution, and secondly, at least in the marine
environment, it is independent of facies.
In today's oceans the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of dissolved
Sr is constant at 0.70920. This geographical con-
sistency is due to the fact that the residence time of
Sr in the oceans is large (=4 Ma) compared with the
time that it takes for the oceans to mix (=103
years). Marine organisms that secrete carbonate or
phosphate skeleta incorporate Sr with the marine
87Sr/86Sr ratio. Due to the low Rb concentration in
carbonates and phosphates, there will not usually be
significant in situ growth of radiogenic 87Sr so that
the fossil material will record the 87Sr/86Sr of the
seawater at the time the organism was alive pro-
vided that it has not been subsequently altered dur-
ing diagenesis. Studies of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in
unaltered marine fossils of known age have revealed
that seawater 87Sr/86Sr has varied through time in a
systematic manner (Fig. 5.19). Figure 5.20 shows a
detail of the seawater curve for the Tertiary where
the 87Sr/86Sr seawater curve is by far the best defined
due to the abundance of unaltered and well-dated
fossil material from DSDP/ODP cores.
Once a seawater reference curve has been con-
structed, it may be used as a dating tool. The pro-
cedure involves analysing the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of
unaltered marine carbonate or phosphate in
a
sample to be dated, locating this value on the
chlorite - gave an age of 174 Ma (which is not inter-
mediate between the illite and chlorite ages). The
K- Ar age of illite from sample B is 158 ± 5 Ma.
These data indicate that leachate-residue pairs
give Rb-Sr dates that are in the same range as
K- Ar ages. However, in detail there are significant
variations in apparent ages, even in one case for
different aliquots of the same clay separate. This
suggests that the leachate-residue two-point Rb-Sr
isochron is a valid means of dating illite but that
there are problems with the procedure as it stands at
present, possibly due to contamination with small
amounts of detrital Sr-bearing minerals. The fact
that K-Ar and Rb-Sr dates are so close to being
concordant reinforces our belief that the ages are
geologically significant.

reference curve and dropping a line down to the
time axis (Fig. 5.20). The accuracy and precision of
dates derived in this way depend on three factors.
The first is analytical uncertainty, but modern ana-
lytical methods are such that this is relatively insigni-
ficant. The second is the gradient of the seawater
curve in the age-range of interest (Fig. 5.21). The
steeper the curve, the better the resolution attain-
able. Optimal resolution is theoretically better than
1Ma for much of the Phanerozoic. The most im-
portant influence on accuracy is however the uncer-
tainty in the seawater reference curve itself. The
main problems in defining the curve are:
1 interlaboratory analytical bias in published results;
2 contamination of marine carbonate samples with
Sr derived from non-marine minerals, e.g. detrital
silicates (this is a particular danger where carbonates
have been separated from the rest of the rock by
acid leaching);
3 post-depositional alteration of the marine car-
bonate; and
4 uncertainty in the biostratigraphic dating of the
samples.
The first problem can be minimized by normalizing
all 87Sr/86Sr data to a standard value (as were the
data in Fig. 5.20)*. The second can be eliminated by
excluding from the curve samples with a significant
acid-insoluble residue. Ideally, the fossil carbonate
should be separated from the host rock physically
(i.e. by microdrilling) rather than chemically (acid
leaching). It is difficult to assess the importance of
the last two problems, let alone correct for them, as
the petrography, mineralogy and biostratigraphy of
analysed samples usually go undocumented in the
published literature.
The uncertainty in a Sr isotope age may be estim-
ated in a variety of ways. Perhaps the simplest is to
draw an envelope around the data that make up the
seawater curve and to use this together with the
accuracy of the 87Sr/86Sr analysis to project onto the
time axis (Fig. 5.20). While not very rigorous, this
does at least give a realistic maximum uncertainty
in the calculated age. Some authors have used
regression techniques to fit a line through the sea-
water reference data (or through a running average)
* Many workers (e.g. DePaolo, 1986) normalize their
dataset to their 87Sr/86Sr value for the NBS 987 Sr stand-
ard. However, Rundberg and Smalley (1989) found that
interlaboratory agreement is improved if the data are
normalized
using Holocene marine carbonate as the
reference.

5.5.6 Example 8: dating Tertiary sediments, Vttring
Plateau, offshore Norway
Sr isotope analyses of samples from ODP Leg 104,
Site 642, on the VQ)ring Plateau, offshore northern
Norway are plotted on Fig. 5.20 (Smalley et al.,
1989). Three samples were analysed: two phosphatic
fish teeth and a calcite bivalve fragment from a
glauconitic tuffaceous sand, all from the interval
288-294m sub-sea floor. The fish teeth (642D-12-2,
78-81 cm and 642D-12-5, 145-149cm) gave ident-
ical
87Sr/86Sr
values
of 0.707828 ± 0.000006

and
0.707825 ± 0.000006,
cor-
responding to an age of 37.0 ± 1.2 Ma. The bivalve
yielded a statistically indistinguishable 87Sr/86Sr value
(0.707811 ± 0.000011) and an age of 38.5 ± 1.7Ma.
These consistent Eocene ages were not in agree-
ment with Miocene ages derived from palynomorph
biostratigraphy (Manum et al., 1989). While it is
conceivable that the dated shell fragments and fish
teeth had been reworked from older sediments, the
consistency of the Sr ages and a glauconite Rb-Sr
age of 40 Ma from the tuffaceous sand, led to a
reinterpretation of the palaeontological data in-
volving contamination with younger palynomorphs
during drilling and coring (Manum et al., 1989).
5.5.7 Tracing the origin ofSr in subsurface fluids
Most subsurface waters contain appreciable amounts
of Sr. The 87Sr/86Sr of this dissolved Sr is a reflection
of the history of interaction between the water and
Sr-bearing minerals and rocks. The ratio therefore
contains information about diagenetic reactions and
history of fluid movement.
Strontium in formation waters can be derived
ultimately from two sources, each with characteristic
87Sr/86Sr: seawater and detrital minerals. Strontium
from seawater can be incorporated into formation
waters directly by trapping of seawater in the sedi-
ment, or indirectly by dissolution of marine car-
bonate minerals which will contain Sr with a seawater
87Sr/86Sr ratio corresponding to their age, between
extreme values of =::::0.7069 in the Middle Jurassic
and =::::0.7092 at present. Most Sr-bearing detrital
minerals in clastic sediments have high Rb/Sr ratios
and/or are old relative to the depositional age of
the host sediment and will have evolved a high
('radiogenic') 87Sr/86Sr value. Strontium derived
from dissolution of detrital minerals will therefore
usually have a much higher 87Sr/86Sr than con-
temporaneous seawater. For example, detrital K-
feldspars in the North Sea basin frequently have
87Sr/86Sr values> 0.730; high-Rb/Sr micas can have
87Sr/86Sr > 0.800. In some cases, detrital silicate
phases may have lower 87Sr/86Sr than contem-
poraneous seawater. This is particularly true for
volcaniclastic sediments which contain young, low-
Rb/Sr igneous lithic material with a low I(Sr).
Strontium isotope ratios are particularly useful for
characterizing formation waters in marine carbonate
rocks where the host rock itself has a distinct and
(initially) homogeneous seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio. In
some cases, 87Sr/86Sr of the present formation water
is quite different from that of the host rock. This
must mean that the water contains Sr derived from
outside the carbonate unit. High 87Sr/86Sr is likely to

* The belief that diagenesis does not cause fractionation of
Sm and Nd has been challenged on the basis of a study of
the model ages of Tertiary sandstones in the Gulf Coast
(Awwiller & Mack, 1991).
The model age calculated from CHUR is given by the inter-
section of the two curves, B. If the sample had formed
from 'depleted' mantle from which magma had already been
withdrawn, with higher 143Nd/144Nd and 147Sm/144Nd,
its true crustal residence age would be greater (B').

than granitic rocks and is in this sense complemen-
tary to Rb-Sr dating. There are other important dif-
ferences between the two methods. Both Sm and Nd
are light rare earth elements (REE) and display very
similar geochemical behaviour, so that the range of
Sm/Nd ratios in geological materials is narrow rela-
tive to the range of Rb/Sr, from about 0.1 to 0.5.
Because Sm and Nd have such similar chemical
properties, they are only fractionated significantly
by
partial
melting.
Metamorphism,
chemical
weathering, erosion, transportation and diagenesis
are usually considered to have no effect on Sm/Nd
and 143Nd/144Nd ratios (Chaudhuri & Cullers, 1979;

sediment retain the same Sm-Nd model ages as the

5.6 The Sm-Nd system
The
samarium-neodymium
geochronometer
is
based on the decay of 147Sm to 143Nd with a half-life
of 1.06 x 1011 years. 143Nd abundance in geological
materials is usually expressed as a ratio, relative to
the stable non-radiogenic isotope 144Nd, and the
basic equation used for dating is:
143Nd
(143Nd)

144Nd . ..

indicate that the Sr comes from clastic sediments,
either because the water migrated out of a clastic
sequence into the carbonates or possibly due to
diffusion of solutes from adjacent formations (e.g.
Stueber et al., 1984; Chaudhuri et al., 1987; Emery
et al., 1987; Smalley et al., 1992). The presence in
formation waters of Sr that is less radiogenic than
the host sediment can often be shown to relate to
dissolution of volcanic debris (Elderfield & Gieskes,
1982; Egeberg et al., 1990).
Strontium isotopes can also be used to characterize
the origin of the strontium contained in diagenetic
cements. Unless recrystallized, carbonates and some
sulphates such as celestite will retain their initial
87Sr/86Sr because of their low Rb/Sr ratios. Car-
bonate cements from the Smackover Formation of
Arkansas, for example, have 87Sr/86Sr values far
higher than the original marine carbonate of the
host rock (Stueber et al., 1984). The implication
is that a component of the Sr was derived from
an underlying shale through which the formation
waters migrated before entering the Smackover.
Minerals with high Rb/Sr ratios will have measured
87Sr/86Sr greater than the original value due to decay
of 87Rb. Their initial ratios must be calculated from
present-day 87Sr/86Sr and age. Figure 5.18 shows
that both of the samples of illite cement from the
Rotliegend aeolian sandstones which we attempted
to date by the Rb-Sr isochron method have I(Sr) of
about 0.711. This is higher than seawater of any age
and suggests that the water responsible for illite
precipitation had dissolved significant amounts of
old detrital minerals.
This equation is analogous to that used for Rb-Sr
dating and the Sm- Nd system can be used in much
the
same way,
by analysing
several
cogenetic
samples or subsamples (such as mineral separ-
ates) and constructing an isochron. Samarium-
neodymium is particularly useful for dating basic
and ultrabasic rocks which have higher Sm/Nd ratios

Jacobsen, 1988; Mearns, 1988). The main fractiona-
tion of Sm from Nd will generally have taken place
when a sediment's igneous precursor separated from
the mantle by partial melting. Sm-Nd ages even of
sediments therefore tend to represent the time since
the Nd in the sample separated from the mantle.
If 143Nd/144Nd and Sm/Nd have been preserved

and

Samarium-neodymium dating can in principle be
used to obtain ages for diagenetic minerals although
it will suffer from the same problem as Rb- Sr
dating: that of obtaining an isochron. Sm-Nd has in
fact been used to date authigenic illite using a pro-
cedure closely
analogous
to that described for
Rb-Sr (Section 5.5.4; Ohr et al., 1991). However,
the main application of the method to sedimentary

The simplest model used for determining initial
Nd ratios is known as CHUR (chondritic uni-
form reservoir), a model for the evolution of the
143Nd/144Nd ratio in the mantle which assumes
that it has the same 143Nd/144Nd and 147Sm/144Nd
ratios as chondritic meteorites (Fig. 5.22, p. 125).
The model age is calculated by using the sample
143Nd/144Nd and Sm/Nd ratios to reconstruct the
143Nd/144Nd back through time to the point when it
was identical to that of CHUR. CHUR is not how-
ever an accurate description of the evolution of Nd
isotopes in all parts of the mantle (Faure, 1986).
Production of magmas by partial melting leaves the
mantle locally depleted in light REE and with a
higher SmlNd ratio than CHUR. More sophisticated
models for the 143Nd/144Nd evolution path for the
mantle underlying a particular crustal segment can
be calculated by assuming a time that mantle deple-
tion occurred and a modified mantle Sm/Nd ratio
(e.g. Nelson & DePaolo, 1988); or determined
empirically by the analysis of mantle-derived rocks
of various ages (e.g. Mearns, 1988). 143Nd/144Nd
ratios are often expressed using an € (epsilon) nota-
tion, which represents the variation in parts per
thousand of the 143Nd/144Nd ratio in the sample
from chondritic reference material such as CHUR
(Jacobsen & Wasserburg, 1980).

Sm-Nd crustal residence ages (CRA) may also be

enance of the Statfjord Formation is quite distinct
from that of the Dunlin and Brent Groups. The very

Each of these decay schemes may be expressed as an
isochron relationship similar to that described in
Section 5.5.1 for Rb-Sr. The two V-Pb decay
schemes can also be used in combination in order to
date rocks and minerals. This is the Pb-Pb method
of dating which makes use of the rate of change of
radiogenic 207Pb relative to 206Pb (Fig. 5.25, p. 127).
The Pb-Pb method is analytically simple as it only
requires measurement of Pb isotope ratios which
can be performed using a single Pb chemical separa-
tion and a single mass spectrometer run.
The application of V - Pb and Pb-Pb dating to
sedimentary rocks is fairly new. The main area of
interest is the dating of marine carbonates. Seawater
has a high VIPb ratio, and although V and Pb are

only incorporated into marine carbonate in trace
concentrations, it appears that the high V IPb ratio is
inherited (Moorbath et ai., 1987). This makes V-Pb
and Pb-Pb dating of carbonates feasible, and indeed
sensible Pb-Pb isochron dates have been obtained
for a number of Precambrian limestones (e.g.
Moorbath et ai., 1987). The uncertainty in the cal-
culation of isochron ages is greater in younger car-
bonates. Precision may be of the order of ± 10%
in the Palaeozoic, while in the youngest carbonates
for which published Pb-Pb dates exist it is ± 20%
(Jahn, 1988; Fig. 5.25). One way of obtaining a
more precise limestone age is to use V - Pb rather
than Pb-Pb dating. While this method is more time
consuming (involving isotope dilution measure-
ments of V and Pb concentration as well as Pb
isotopic analysis) the precision attainable is far
superior, even in rocks with a relatively small range
in U/Pb ratios. For example, Smith and Farquhar
(1989) obtained a date of 367 ± 5Ma for Devonian
corals (Fig. 5.26, p. 127).

6.1 Introduction
This is the first of four chapters in which we will look
in detail at some case histories chosen to illustrate
the application of geochemical techniques to petro-
leum geology. In this chapter, we are going to look
at its role in contributing to porosity and perme-
ability (reservoir quality) prediction. Porosity is the
proportion of rock which is available to be filled
with fluid - water plus petroleum - and is one of the
parameters which must be specified in any predic-
tion of the total amount of petroleum in a structure.
Even a high porosity rock will however not be of
economic interest if it is impermeable. Permeability
and the thickness of net reservoir together largely
determine the flow rate at which a well can produce
a particular type of petroleum and hence exert
a major influence on cash flow and job security.
Accurate prediction of porosity and permeability
therefore reduces two of the important risks inherent
in petroleum exploration, appraisal and develop-
ment. This chapter is not supposed to be a manual
explaining how to predict the porosity and perme-
ability of a petroleum reservoir. Its aim is to use case
histories to illustrate how the geochemical methods
described in the first half of this book can contribute
to the prediction. Nonetheless, so that the reader
may better appreciate the nature of this contribu-
tion, we will first describe the different approaches
to porosity and permeability prediction.
There are two end-member approaches to porosity
prediction. One involves the use of a computer
program that calculates porosity, usually by coupling
129

130 Chapter 6
two models* (e.g. Meshri & Walker, 1990). The first
model assumes that chemical equilibrium is main-
tained between rock and porewater at all times
(Meshri, 1990; Meshri &
Ortoleva,
1990). The
second involves calculating the water flux through
the sediment as a function of time (Bethke, 1985;
Bethke et al., 1988; Garven, 1989; Demming et al.,
1990; Harrison & Summa, 1991). There are a num-
ber of variations on this theme. The simplest assume
that diagenesis and porosity modification take place
in a closed chemical system so that mineralogy and
mineral volume can be calculated without the need
to predict fluid flux. These are clearly inadequate
because the diagenesis of reservoir rocks is not a
closed system phenomenon, at least on the scale of
individual lithological units (Gluyas & Coleman,
1992). Other models incorporate kinetic descrip-
tions of mineral-water reactions. No matter how
sophisticated, all of these models make two key
assumptions: that it is possible to estimate accurately
the fluid flow through a sediment -
volumes and
chemistry -
over a period of tens to hundreds of
millions of years, throughout the sediment's burial
history; and that as the water passes through the
rock, the nature of the interactions can be predicted
from equilibrium thermodynamic databases. Many
models used to calculate water flow in sedimentary
basins are impressive and physically perfectly sound
but quantitative predictions depend on geological
input which to all intents and purposes has to be
guessed. We would single out the need to specify
horizontal and vertical permeabilities on a regional
scale as a function of time. We do not intend to
belittle the contributions that these models can
make to understanding diagenetic processes. We
simply believe that because they are capable of
precise quantitative predictions, they can be danger-
ously seductive.
The other end-member approach to porosity and
permeability prediction, and that most current in oil
companies, is entirely empirical and relies on the
observation that both are commonly correlated with
other geological parameters. The most commonly
used are maximum burial depth, integrated time-
temperature history, detrital composition, sorting
and grain size (Scherer, 1987; Schmoker & Gautier,
1988; Bloch, 1991). We believe that there is no
realistic alternative to resorting to some form of
empirical prediction and all of the case histories that
* See the recent collection edited by Meshri and Ortoleva
(1990).
we describe make use of empirical observations in
some way.
The most general method of predicting the quality
of an undrilled reservoir involves the construction of
a plot of the mean porosity or permeability of the
target facies (known where it has been drilled)
against depth. In a general sense, rocks tend to be
less porous at depth than they are near the surface,
due to the combined effects of increased compac-
tion and increasing volumes of diagenetic cements.
These plots often therefore show a correlation which
can be used predictively by fitting some kind of
regression equation to the data. This is usually
exponential but over a limited depth range may also
be linear. It is not of course sensible to plot the
porosity of any old rock. The key to making an
accurate prediction is to plot what is to be predicted.
If the aim is to predict the porosity of shallow
marine quartz arenites, it would be unwise to include
volcanogenic sandstones in the database because
these will probably contain unstable minerals which
will affect reservoir quality in some unexpected
way. Just how good a prediction will be is crucially
dependent on the amount and the quality of the data
used to produce the plot. In the most extreme case -
an undrilled basin -
there would probably be no
local data at all. The only option would be to use
porosity data from another basin, for a reservoir rock
chosen to be analogous to the hypothetical target.
Regressions of porosity against depth present a
general picture and smooth out irregularities. In Fig.
6.1, some (imaginary) values for mean reservoir
porosity are plotted against depth. In the first case,
the predicted mean porosity for an undrilled struc-
ture at a depth of 4 km is 12.0 ± 5.5%.
In the
second case, one extra point has been added to
represent a reservoir with 25% porosity at a depth of
4.25 km. After adding this to the dataset, the new
prediction for a structure at 4 km is 14.5 ± 12%.
The main effect of adding the new point has been to
increase the uncertainty of the prediction. Regres-
sion of the entire dataset does not therefore permit
the prediction of anomalies such as porous reservoir
at great depth. This is a pity because these are
exactly what we would like to be able to predict.
This is where inorganic geochemistry can make a
contribution.
The geochemical methods decribed in chapters 2 to
5 can be used to describe the conditions under which
rocks became cemented and had their porosities and
permeabilities modified. This information can often
be used to predict where particular mineral cements

Porosity and Permeability Prediction 131
6.2.1 Introduction
The Flemish Pass Basin is located some 400 km east
of the Newfoundland coast, close to the margin
of the North Atlantic, and is one of a number of
rift basins on the Grand Banks (Fig. 6.2). Despite
its location just north of the Jeanne D'Arc Basin
(which contains at least one giant oilfield, Hibernia;
Tankard & Welsink, 1987), Flemish Pass has at-
tracted relatively little exploration interest. This is
partly because the water depth over much of the
basin is between 1000 and 1100 m and partly because
a large number of icebergs pass through the area on
their way south from Baffin Bay (witness the fate
of the Titanic which lies on the continental slope
nearby). Exploration drilling in a kilometre of water
is expensive but possible. However, the best way to
react to a big iceberg is to move out of the way
and accept that production will be impossible for a
proportion of the year. To compensate for this
down-time, high well production rates (governed by
permeability-thickness) would be required for any
discovery to be commercial, almost regardless of its
total reserves. Reservoir quality is therefore a key to
the prospectivity of the Flemish Pass Basin.
The problem for the Flemish Pass Basin may be
stated as follows: how can we predict where in the
basin a particular target reservoir will be capable of
sustaining flow rates high enough for a discovery to
be worth developing?

case study involved using geochemical methods
for distinguishing between two different types of
diagenetic kaolinite in sandstones of the Brent
Group. These types must be distinguished if their
influence on porosity is to be understood. We then
present an example from the Magnus Field in the
Northern North Sea which shows how a geochemical
study of diagenetic cements in a discovery well
might help to produce a porosity map at an early
stage and reduce the cost of field appraisal and
development. The next case history is a study aimed
at understanding the origin of fracture sets in a
reservoir in which these exert a major influence
on permeability, the Machar Field, Central North
Sea. Finally, we describe the use of SEM-based PIA
to investigate the origin of apparent high permeabil-
ity streaks in the Forties Field, Central North Sea.

respondingly higher. The first case history in this
chapter involves exploration for sandstone reservoirs
in a virtually undrilled area, the Flemish Pass Basin
off the coast of Newfoundland. A porosity-depth
plot paints a bleak picture, suggesting that most of
the basin is not prospective. However, by determin-
ing the age of quartz cementation using fluid inclu-
sions and relating it to that of oil generation, it
proved possible to identify parts of the basin where
the reservoir might have escaped cementation and
retained high porosity and permeability. In the
second case history, we describe how a geochemical
study of the diagenesis of the Norphlet Formation in
the Gulf of Mexico led to an understanding of the
factors responsible for preventing quartz cementa-
tion and to a quantitative prediction of the thickness
of net reservoir (not quartz-cemented). The third

6.2.2 Geological background
The geology of the Flemish Pass Basin is particu-
larly complex. It contains at least three syn-rift
megasequences related to three separate cycles of
rifting and subsequent sea-floor spreading (Fig. 6.3;
Foster & Robinson, 1993). The first rifting event
began in the Triassic and was followed by movement
of North Africa away from North America south
of the Newfoundland Fracture Zone about 175 Ma
ago (Aalenian). This transform fault now forms the
southern margin of the Grand Banks. The associ-
ated megasequence (MS1) is mainly very deeply
buried so that it has only proved possible to map
and interpret the uppermost sequence, MSl-50
(Kimmeridgian
to Early
Berriasian) which
fills
two WNW-ENE trending sub-basins. The second
rifting
event
involved
NW- SE
extension
and
was a prelude to spreading of the Grand Banks
away from Iberia about 125 Ma ago (Barremian).
MS2 fills sub-basins that trend NE-SW and is of
Early Berriasian to Mid-Aptian age. The third and
final rifting phase preceded movement of Canada
away from Greenland 100-105 Ma ago (Albian).

The last megasequence is a Late Cretaceous to

margin underwent thermal subsidence.
Seven wells have been drilled in the Flemish Pass
Basin with one discovery at North Dana (Fig. 6.4).
Five of these were however drilled to test what were
effectively extensions of the geology of the Jeanne
D'Arc Basin; only Baccalieu and Gabriel penetrated
thick sequences of syn-rift sediments in Flemish
Pass. Several wells showed that a source rock is
present in the Kimmeridgian to Early Berriasian
MSl-50 sequence and seismic mapping suggested
that it would be mature over large parts of the basin.
Shallow marine, potential reservoir sandstones in
MSl-50 drilled in Baccalieu have very low porosity
and permeability because they are cemented by
quartz.

6.2.3 Approach
Economic constraints dictate that wells from any
discovery will need to produce at rates of greater
than 5000bbl.day-l. Flow rate is determined by

reasonable assumptions about production condi-
tions, to produce a 30
0API oil at 5000 bbl.day-l
requires a reservoir with permeability-thickness of
about 100OOmD.ft- 1• This problem can be reduced
to that of predicting permeability for different
notional values of net reservoir thickness.
We
tackled this problem in two parts.
1 Calculate a depth below which quartz-cemented
shallow marine sands (like those in Baccalieu) are
unlikely to produce at > 5000 bbl.day-l. The cut-off
depth can then be superimposed on a depth map of
the target reservoir and areas of acceptable reservoir
quality delineated.

circles are porosities for the thin correlative intervals in the
Lancaster and Panther wells. These plot very close to the
exponential curve fitted to the Baccalieu data and give
some confidence that this relationship may be applied over
the entire basin. The broken line is a curve that we use for
predicting the porosity of an uncemented quartz arenite
and has the equation <1>% = 50exp[- z{km}/(2.4 + 0.5z)]
(Robinson & Gluyas, 1992b). The horizontal distance
between the two curves is a measure of the volume of
mineral cement in the sandstones. Note that depths are
plotted below sea-floor, not below rotary table. This makes
a major difference in Flemish Pass where water depths are
very variable.
I derive a relationship between permeability and
porosity from core analyses; and
2 derive a relationship between porosity and depth
using wireline logs (calibrated by porosity measure-
ments made on core if available).
In our example, there is yet another problem: the
shallow marine sands have not been cored. The only
way around this is to choose an analogue. For-
tunately, the Jeanne D'Arc Basin to the south pro-
vides a good candidate: the Hibernia Formation is a
shallow marine interval of about the same age and
has been repeatedly cored because of its importance
as a reservoir. Figure 6.5 shows that there is a good
correlation between the permeability and porosity
of the Hibernia Formation sandstones.

2 Predict the distribution of sands protected from
quartz
cementation
(and
consequent
reduction
in porosity and permeability) by early filling with
petroleum.
The first approach involves the derivation of a rela-
tionship
between
permeability and
depth.
The
second involves the use of geochemical methods
to time quartz cementation, and burial history
modelling of the source rock to date petroleum
generation. In interpreting the geochemical data, we
make a key assumption: that quartz cementation is a
regional phenomenon that affects large parts of a
basin at about the same time (Robinson & Gluyas,
1992a; Gluyas et al., 1993). It then becomes possible
to extrapolate an age determined for quartz cement
growth in one well to other parts of the basin and to
relate the timing of cementation to that of petro-
leum generation and migration.
6.2.4 Establishing a relationship between
permeability and depth
In an area like Flemish Pass where there are few
wells and virtually no core, the first problems in
trying to determine how permeability changes with
depth are almost always what data to use and where
to get it. Permeability measurements are made on
core plugs, so are often not available over a range of
depths. In such cases, it is necessary to approach the
problem in two stages:

136 Chapter 6
squares fit to the data gives the equation:
K (mD) = 0.010821 x 10(0.25244<1»
(<1> is porosity in %). A porosity-depth relationship
for the target shallow marine sands in Baccalieu was
obtained by averaging sand porosities calculated
from wireline logs over 100 m intervals and regress-
ing these against depth (Fig. 6.6, p. 135):
<1> (%) = 76.76 x 1O(-0.3447Iz)
(z is depth sub-sea-floor in km). A reservoir with
250 ft of net pay needs a permeability of 80 mD to
produce at a rate of 5000 bbl.day-l. This cor-
responds to a porosity of 13.5% and a cut-off depth
of 2.2 km. If the amount of net pay were as high
as 750ft, the permeability needed would be only
27 mD, corresponding to a porosity of 15.3% and
depth of 2.0 km. The results are displayed in Fig.
6.7. This is a map constructed from seismic data, of
the depth to the top of the suggested reservoir
interval
below the sea-floor.

6.2.6 Conclusions
A glance at Fig. 6.7 would be enough to raise doubt
in the minds of even the most optimistic of explora-
tion managers about the prospectivity of any play
involving MSl-50
shallow
marine
sands.
Over
most parts of the basin, it seems at first unlikely
that cemented sands will be permeable enough to
sustain well flow rates in excess of the required
5000 bbl.day-l. The value of the geochemical data
in this case has been that it has led to the identifica-
tion of substantial parts of the basin that may not
be cemented by quartz and which may, as a con-
sequence, buck this trend. The risk on reservoir
quality put on any structure close to these areas
would be reduced. Unfortunately, we are not able
to indulge in a postmortem to check this idea.
The Flemish Pass acreage attracted no bids and the
prospects in the basin remain undrilled.
homogenization temperatures show little scatter and
indicate quartz precipitation at temperatures above
124°C (Fig. 6.8). The true temperature of quartz
growth will be greater than 124°C by an amount
equivalent to the pressure correction (see Section
3.4.3). If CH4 is present in the inclusion fluids, the
pressure correction will be small. The inclusions
from Lancaster were too small for analysis by LRS,
but final solid melting temperatures above O°C
suggest that a gas is dissolved in the inclusion fluid.
This is most likely to be CH4• When referred to a
modelled burial and thermal history for Lancaster,
the homogenization temperatures therefore give a
maximum age for quartz growth of about 50 Ma ago
(Early Eocene) which is probably close to the true
age (Fig. 6.9).
The next stage is to identify areas where oil
generation commenced before the Eocene. This can
be done by producing an isopach map of the interval
top-Kimmeridgian (the age of the source rock) to
base-Eocene. When decompacted, this map shows
the depth of the source rock at the time of quartz
cementation which can be calibrated in terms of
source rock maturity (Fig. 6.10). The map indicates
that oil generation began over large areas of the
basin before quartz cement growth reduced reservoir
porosity and permeability. Any sealed structures
that were charged by these oil kitchens are likely to
have been protected from quartz cement growth and
to have higher porosities and permeabilities than
would be predicted by the empirical depth relation-
ships established for cemented sandstone.

2.2 km. In this area, the risk ascribed to reservoir
quality is high because wells are unlikely to produce
at rates in excess of 5000 bbl.day-l unless the net
reservoir is extremely (and probably implausibly)
thick. In the medium shaded parts of the basin, even
net reservoir less than 250 ft thick would produce
oil at acceptable flow rates. In this area, the risk
attached to reservoir quality is low. The area in
between, bounded by contours at 2.0 and 2.2 km,
represents intermediate risk.
6.2.5 Prediction of uncemented reservoir
The timing of quartz cementation may be estimated
by measuring the homogenization temperature of
primary fluid inclusions and referring these to a
modelled burial and thermal history. Core of MS1
sandstones was available only from the Lancaster
and Baccalieu wells. Samples from Baccalieu con-
tained no usable fluid inclusions. In Lancaster,
the only core came from shallow marine sands of
probable Callovian age. A diligent search through
samples of this sandstone revealed only seven prim-
ary fluid inclusions in quartz cement, but their

Two kilometres of Mid- Late Cretaceous burial shown in the figure was put into the model to test the sensitivity of
petroleum generation to uncertainties in the amount of pre-Tertiary erosion. In fact, the amount of pre-Tertiary erosion
was probably negligible. In this case, the sampled unit would not have reached temperatures of about 12SoC until about
SO Ma ago. The methods used to construct the model are described by Allen and Allen (1990).
6.3 Net to gross prediction: Norphlet
Formation, Gulf of Mexico
6.3.1 Introduction
The Norphlet Formation is a Middle to Late Jurassic
succession dominated by aeolian sediments and
is present in the subsurface beneath much of the
southern USA, from Texas to Florida. Gas reserves
in the Norphlet offshore are of the order of 4.5 tcf
(trillion cubic feet). The well that is the subject of
this case history, Mobile 821 # 1, was drilled off the
coast of Louisiana in 1987 and tested gas plus minor
condensate in Norphlet sandstones (Fig. 6.11). The
sandstones showed a distinct vertical zonation in
reservoir quality. The upper part had porosities of
1-3% and correspondingly low permeabilities of
< 0.1 mD and acted as a partial seal. In the lower
part, porosities reached 20% or more and perme-
abilities of several hundred millidarcys. The zona-
tion is not due to a change in sedimentary facies
since the entire Norphlet in 821#1 is formed of
well sorted, medium- to coarse-grained aeolian
sandstone. In fact, it is due entirely to variations in
the amount of quartz cement: the upper 'Tight
Zone' contains around 10% quartz cement while the
lower 'pay zones' contain none.
The Tight Zone is a regional phenomenon in the
Norphlet and its thickness has a significant influence
on the amount of petroleum in a structure. It would
therefore be useful to be able to predict thickness
before
drilling.
Unfortunately,
it
is
extremely
variable, even within individual
prospects.
The
mineralogical
and
geochemical
work
described
below was undertaken in order to try to understand
the reasons for the differential quartz cementation
in the hope that this might provide a means of pre-
dicting the thickness of the Tight Zone.

6.3.2 Geological background
The Norphlet Formation was deposited during the
Late Callovian to Oxfordian within broad evaporite
basins on the northern margin of a failed rift zone
and overlies the Mid-Jurassic Louann Salt (Fig.
6.12; Mancini et ai., 1985). The centres of the basins
contain thick aeolian sandstone representing dune
fields and these are the target reservoir rocks. To the
south of the dunes, the Norphlet passes into fine-
grained marine clastics and carbonates. The source
rock for the gas in Norphlet reservoirs is the Micro-
laminated Zone (MLZ), the lowest part of the over-
lying Smackover Formation, which is probably partly
laterally equivalent to the Norphlet. The MLZ is
also the most important top seal and the Louann
Salt forms a bottom seal. Prospective structures are
four-way dip closures associated with salt movement.
6.3.3 Approach
A large proportion of the total thickness of the
Norphlet Formation (about 450ft) was cored in
821#1, so we had access to a lot of samples and were

able to obtain a large amount of quantitative infor-
mation from XRD and petrography about how
mineralogy and certain features of the rock fabric
varied between the Tight Zone and the net reservoir
below. By relating these data to porosity and perme-
ability measurements made on core plugs, we could
see how particular changes in diagenetic mineralogy
influenced reservoir quality. Having established a
detailed picture of the reasons for the variability of
reservoir quality, we began a geochemical project to
characterize the diagenetic conditions under which
mineral cements grew,
principally temperature,
time and water isotope chemistry. Our hope was
that the mineralogical and geochemical data would
Porosity and Permeability Prediction 141
together provide a clue as to why the Tight Zone
was so heavily cemented and perhaps even a means
of predicting its thickness.
6.3.4 Quantitative mineralogy: controls on reservoir
quality
Thin-sections of Norphlet sandstone show that there
are several diagenetic minerals. Chlorite is common,
forming isopachous coatings on quartz grains, and
seems to pre-date quartz cement (Fig. 6.13). Illite
cement is present in the Norphlet onshore where it
forms characteristic fibres bridging pores (McBride
et al., 1987). However, in 821# 1, illite takes the

form of tangential grain coatings and is probably not
a cement but an early infiltration clay (Fig. 6.14,
p. 141). K-feldspar syntaxial overgrowths on feld-
spar grains are widespread but never abundant.
Their position relative to the clays in the paragenetic
sequence
is
unclear,
but
they
pre-date
quartz
cementation. Before quartz precipitated, petroleum
entered the Norphlet, as there is a film of bitumen
which stains chlorite and feldspar overgrowths but
which is overgrown by quartz. We found no evid-
ence that any of the porosity preserved in the lower
part of the Norphlet in 821#1 is secondary.
Figure 6.15 shows how the contents and propor-
tions of some of these minerals vary through the
Norphlet formation. The left hand column shows
porosity. The Tight Zone is defined operationally as
having average porosity consistently below 8%. The
amount of quartz cement in the Tight Zone and
underlying Transitional Zone varies considerably up
to nearly 15%. In the pay zones below, quartz
cement content is uniformly low, dropping to less
than 5% beneath 21600ft. Minus-cement porosity is
on average higher in the Tight Zone than in the pay
zones (average 28.6 ± 6.7%[2cr] in Tight and Trans-
itional Zones and 23.5 ± 7.4% in the pay zones).
The relative proportions of clay minerals also change
vertically through the section. Particularly towards
the top of the Tight Zone, illite is dominant over
chlorite. This pattern is however reversed near the
base of the Tight Zone and from about 21500 ft
down, chlorite is the dominant clay mineral. Rela-
tive clay abundances shown in Fig. 6.15 are from
XRD analysis of clay separates. XRD cannot how-
ever provide reliable measurement of absolute clay
mineral abundances. To see whether the pattern of
absolute abundances also changed, we analysed
some samples by thermogravimetry (TG; Fig. 6.16).
These show that chlorite content increases from less
than 1% at the top of the Norphlet to 5-7% in the
pay zones. Over the same interval, illite content
decreases from nearly 10% to virtually nothing.
6.3.5 Conditions of mineral cement growth
Laser 4OAr_ 39Ar ages of K-feldspar overgrowths
from the Norphlet Formation are described in Sec-
tion 5.4.4. The dating was not particularly success-
ful, probably due to a combination of the small size
of the overgrowths and Ar release from detrital K-
feldspar grains. The most that can be said is that the
ages are consistent with K-feldspar growth during
early diagenesis.
Though we looked very hard, we failed to turn up
any fluid inclusions in quartz cement. We therefore
resorted to two other methods to estimate the tim-
ing of quartz growth. The first involves calculating
minus-cement porosities in the cemented sand-
stones from point-count data and assuming that this
represents the porosity of the sandstone before
cementation. The average can then be referred to
a compaction curve that describes the porosity

144 Chapter 6
of an uncemented sand as a function of depth.
The average Tight Zone minus-cement porosity of
28.6 ± 6.7% corresponds to a cementation depth of
about 3 ± 1 km (Fig. 6.17, p. 143).
The other method for estimating the timing of
quartz cementation
is even
more
indirect and
involves oxygen isotope geothermometry. Quartz
cement separates were isolated by the method
involving leaching and sonic shattering, with sieving
to collect the finest material hopefully richest in
authigenic quartz. 0180 of quartz cement appears to
be between +16 and +170/00 for all of the samples
analysed (Fig. 4.10). To calculate a precipitation
temperature from mineral 0180, we have to con-
strain the isotopic composition of the formation
water from which the quartz grew. Since the Mid-
Jurassic, Louisiana has not wandered further than
30° from the equator. Low altitude meteoric waters
in such low latitudes today have 0180 values be-
tween 0 and -6%0. Meteoric waters are always the
isotopically lightest types of water at a particular
latitude and elevation, so -6%0 is probably a min-
imum value for the oxygen isotope ratio of the water

However when we did this study, we had little
option but to try the same indirect method involving
oxygen isotopes that we used for quartz, to estimate
a minimum temperature for chlorite growth. In Fig.
6.18, 0180
of analysed clay separates is plotted
against the proportion of illite estimated by XRD.
This estimate is only semi-quantitative, but it does
suggest that chlorite 0180 is around 8-10%0. We can
then use the same minimum water 0180 of -60/00 to
calculate a minimum chlorite growth temperature,
remembering as we do so that fractionation factors
for chlorite are not accurately known (Table 4.4). It
turns out to be about ooe (we could probably have
guessed that chlorite growth from ice is improbable).
If chlorite had grown from water as isotopically
heavy as seawater (about -1.2%0 in the Jurassic) the
isotopic data would be compatible with chlorite
growth between about 35 and 65°C.
The results of the geochemical work are sum-
marized in Fig. 6.19. Chlorite and feldspar are both
likely to have precipitated before rapid burial during
the earliest Cretaceous when temperatures in the
Norphlet reached about 100°C. Oxygen isotope data
and
minus-cement
porosities
both
suggest
that
quartz precipitated at some time during the Early
Cretaceous.
6.3.6 Prediction of Tight Zone thickness

imprecise but probably reasonably reliable estimates
of when the various cements grew. How can this be
used to predict Tight Zone thickness? The key lies
firstly in a recognition of the implications for quartz
cementation of the vertical change in the relative
and absolute contents of chlorite and illite; and
secondly, in an interpretation of the cause of the
change.
Early chlorite cement is known to inhibit sub-
sequent precipitation of quartz overgrowths (e.g.
Dixon et al., 1989). This appears to have happened
in the Norphlet in Mobile 821#1: chlorite content
increases from Tight to pay zones while quartz
cement volume declines over the same interval.
Tangential illite clearly has no such inhibitory effect.
The Tight (quartz cemented) Zone is largely de-
veloped in Norphlet Formation which contains tan-
gential illite. On the basis of morphology, this illite
appears to be a detrital infiltration clay, washed into
an unconsolidated sediment through the vadose
zone as far as the water table. It seems plausible
then that the rapid drop in illite content near the
base of the Tight Zone represents a palaeo-water
table. In this case, the Tight Zone thickness is
equivalent to the depth of the palaeo-water table
beneath the ancient land surface.
The top of the Norphlet Formation has substantial
relief which was passively infilled by the overlying
Smackover Formation. We expected that the dis-
tance between the top of the Smackover (originally
a horizontal datum) and the base of the Norphlet
Tight Zone might change over the region in a regular
fashion, reflecting regional changes in the thick-
s

ness of the Smackover and any regional dip on the
water table (Fig. 6.20, p. 145). We therefore meas-
ured this isopach in all the offshore wells and
contoured the data (Fig. 6.21). The map shows a
systematic regional increase in the isopach towards
the south. Tight Zone thickness can be calculated
from the contours at any point prior to drilling by
subtracting the distance between the top Smackover
and the top Norphlet (predicted in the drilling
prognosis).
6.3.7 Conclusions
In this study, a combination of quantitative mineral-
ogy and geochemistry of diagenetic minerals pro-
vided us with enough information to propose an
explanation for the origin of the Norphlet Tight
Zone and a way of predicting its thickness. The most
important information undoubtedly came from the
identification of vertical changes
in
mineralogy
and cement volumes and, arguably, all of the geo-
chemical work on the cements could have been
dispensed with. We could have come up with the
same explanation for the mineralogical patterns
without it (though whether we would have done is
another matter). Flushed with success, we went
ahead and made a prediction of Tight Zone thick-
ness in the next well, 999#1 (Fig. 6.21). This predic-
tion required extrapolation as no other wells had
been drilled so far south. Imagine our disappoint-
ment (relief?) when the well penetrated a com-
pletely different facies in sediments equivalent to
the Norphlet. All bets were off.

6.4 Influence of kaolinite on sandstone
porosity: Brent Province, Northern North
Sea
6.4.1 Introduction
The Brent Province is the collective name for an
area located to the north-east of the Shetlands in the
Northern North Sea which contains a large number
of geologically similar oilfields (Figs 1.1 & 6.22).
The main reservoirs are in a succession of Mid-
Jurassic terrestrial and shallow marine clastic rocks
known as the Brent Group. Kaolinite is a common
mineral in Brent Group sandstones and in some
areas is an important control on their reservoir
quality. It can completely fill and reduce porosity
or may be associated with enhanced, secondary
porosity immediately adjacent to unconformities
(Emery & Myers, 1990). Understanding its origin
ought therefore to offer a tool of some value in
exploring for good quality reservoirs. Unfortunately,
there is kaolinite and there is kaolinite. Its presence
is often ascribed to flushing of the sandstone by
Porosity and Permeability Prediction 147
meteoric water close to an unconformity and there-
fore at low temperatures (e.g. Bj0rlykke, 1984).
Nonetheless, kaolinite can also precipitate as a
diagenetic cement without a feldspar precursor, dur-
ing late burial and at relatively high temperatures
(Longstaffe, 1986; Ayalon & Longstaffe, 1988).
These two types are difficult to distinguish in thin-
section because feldspar precursors are often not
obvious. To complicate matters further, kaolinite can
form as an alteration product of detrital muscovite
and may even be present in sandstones in the form
of deformed mudstone clasts (though these types
can usually be identified from their textural relation-
ships in thin-sections).
In this section, we describe a geochemical study
designed to answer three questions.
1 Does kaolinite in Brent sandstones have a single
origin or are different types of kaolinite important in
different places?
2 If there are kaolinites of more than one type, how
can they be distinguished?
3 What are likely to be the main geological controls
on kaolinite distribution?

6.4.3 Approach
Our problem was to see whether it was possible
to distinguish one type of kaolinite from another
and, if so, to obtain some information about their
origins - meteoric alteration of feldspar or precip-
itation at relatively high temperatures during late
diagenesis? Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic com-
positions are the best parameters for this purpose
because they depend on the isotopic composition of
the water from which the kaolinite grew and there-
fore the type of water· involved (and also in the
case of oxygen, the temperature). We sampled two
wells in which Brent Group sandstones contained
abundant kaolinite, one each in the Ninian and Lyell
fields, chosen to maximize the chances of finding
kaolinite of more than one type (Fig. 6.22). Well
3/3-4a is at the crest of the tilted fault block which
forms the Ninian Field. The Brent Group there is
thin and was probably subjected to one or more
phases of subaerial erosion during the Jurassic (Fig.
6.24). We expected that if kaolinite formed by
meteoric water flushing was going to occur any-
where, it would be present in this well. Well 3/2-4 in
the Lyell Field has a Brent sequence five times
thicker than that of 3/3-4a and there are no un-
conformities above or within the Brent Group.
Sandstones in this well are not likely to have been
exposed subaerially (although the possibility of
meteoric water flow driven along the formation by a
Brent Province field comprises an eroded, tilted
fault block, draped and partially sealed by mud-
stones of the syn- to post-rift Kimmeridge Clay
Formation (which is also the source rock for the oil).
The Brent Group has traditionally been subdivided
lithostratigraphically into the
Broom, Rannoch,
Etive, Ness and Tarbert formations (Fig. 6.23;
Deegan & Scull, 1977; Graue et al., 1987; see
Mitchener et al., 1992 for a sequence-stratigraphic
approach to Brent geology). With the exception of
the Broom Formation, which appears to represent a
separate early phase of basin filling, these forma-
tions have been interpreted in terms of the advance
and retreat of a wave-dominated deltaic complex.
The Rannoch and Etive formations record the ad-
vance of a shoreline and form an upward-coarsening
unit. The variable facies included in the Ness com-
prise coastal plain sediments. These are capped
by shoreline to shallow marine sandstones of the
Tarbert Formation, representing the retreat of the
delta.

At this point in the study, we started to acquire
that inner glow familiar to all scientists who have set
out to test a hypothesis and have just had their
prejudices confirmed. This interpretation of the
isotopic ratios is however contingent on the assump-
tion that the measured hydrogen isotopic composi-
tions of the kaolinites have not changed since the
mineral precipitated. This may not be true. There is
a suggestion that hydrogen in clay minerals may
undergo geologically rapid isotope exchange with
hydrogen in formation waters (see Section 4.3.2). If
this is the case, the large difference in DD between
Ninian and Lyell kaolinites may reflect differences
in the formation waters that are present in the two
fields today, and not differences in the conditions of
kaolinite growth. This possibility could and should
be tested by analysing the hydrogen isotope com-
positions of the formation waters in the fields, but
we were unable to obtain suitable samples.

Fig. 6.26 Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses of
kaolinite separates. For analysis of kaolinite isotopic
compositions, sandstone samples were disaggregated and
2-10 Ilm size fractions separated by centrifuging. These
were found by trial and error to contain the greatest
proportion of the kaolinites of interest. All but one of the
analysed separates contained> 90% kaolinite (determined
by XRD).
isotopic compOSItions of the kaolinites from the
two wells are both compatible with growth from
meteoric water at low temperatures. This question
may be answered in the following way.
1 Estimate the hydrogen isotope ratio of the water
from which the kaolinite grew using the hydrogen
isotope fractionation equation (though see Table
4.4). Water tends to be about 30%0 more positive
than coexisting kaolinite, regardless of temperature.
For the mean 8D of the Ninian samples of -860/00,
the corresponding water isotope ratio will be about
-56%0.
2 Calculate the oxygen isotope ratio of a meteoric
water with this hydrogen isotope ratio using the
relationship between 8180
and 80 for meteoric
waters (see Section 4.3.1). This will be a minimum
value for the oxygen isotope ratio of the water from
which the kaolinite grew, not the actual value.
3 Use this calculated minimum water 8180 and the
measured kaolinite 8180
to calculate a minimum
temperature for kaolinite growth using the oxygen
isotope fractionation equation.
In Ninian, the minimum temperature estimated for
kaolinite growth is about 20°C; in Lyell, about 60°C.
In the case of Ninian, this is perfectly compatible
with a near surface origin from feldspar alteration by
meteoric water. In Lyell, however, kaolinite growth
must have taken place at depths in excess of about
1.5 km. Kaolinites in the two wells seem to have
fundamentally different origins.
6.4.5 Conclusions
Subject to the uncertainty described above, ana-
lyses of the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of
kaolinite from Ninian and Lyell are compatible
with the suggestion from the geological settings of
the two fields and from the petrography that the
kaolinites in the two wells have fundamentally dif-
ferent origins. That in Ninian probably formed
through alteration of feldspar by meteoric water,
close to an unconformity and at low temperatures.
That in Lyell formed at higher temperatures during
burial by a different (and unknown) mechanism. At
the very least, this information would stop someone
trying to draw a simple contour map of kaolinite
content for the Brent Group. At best, it could be
used to help understand the distribution of kaolinite.
One type should be associated with subaerial un-
conformities which cut the Brent succession. A
second type will not be spatially related to un-
conformities at all, but might increase in volume
with depth.
6.5 Appraisal from a discovery well:
Magnus Field, Northern North Sea
6.5.1 Introduction
The Magnus Field is located in Blocks 211/12a and
211/7 of the UK Continental Shelf, about 160 km
north-east of the Shetland Islands (Fig. 1.1). It was
discovered in 1974 and came into production in 1983

152 Chapter 6
after 9 years of appraisal and development. Oil-
in-place is estimated to have been approximately
1650 Mbbl, some 720 Mbbl of which is recoverable.
To date, 26 appraisal and development wells have
been drilled (17 of them cored) and provide detailed
information about the distribution of porosity and
permeability in the field. Both are extremely vari-
able. There is a difference in mean porosity of about
7% between crest and oil-water contact, a vertical
distance of only about 400 m, with corresponding
changes in permeability from less than 30 mD
downflank to close to 800 mD near the crest. These
changes in reservoir quality are now well constrained
because the field has been so comprehensively
drilled. It would however have been extremely use-
ful to be able to map porosity and permeability
across the field as soon as possible after its discovery
because this information would have influenced the
number and locations of appraisal and development
wells and possibly even the choice of development
scheme.
In this section, we will go back in time to 1974
and pretend that the only information that we have
about the discovery comes from seismic data and a

(single) discovery well which is not on the crest of
the structure. The well that we are going to use is
211/12-5 (Fig. 6.27). The discovery well was in fact
211/12-1, but the two are in similar positions relative
to the crest of the structure and far more data are
available for 211/12-5. Using only this small amount
of data, how might we have been able to produce
maps of mean reservoir porosity and permeability?
6.5.2 Geological background
The Magnus Field consists of a fairly simple east-
dipping fault block (Figs 6.27 & 6.28; De'Ath &
Schuyleman, 1981; Rainey, 1987; Emery & Myers,
1990). Field limits are defined to the east by the
oil-water contact and to the west by erosional trunca-
tion of the reservoir. Seal is provided by lime-
stones of the early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group
and mudstones of the Shetland Group. The main
reservoir is the Kimmeridgian Magnus Sandstone
Member, made up of four lobes of submarine fan
sandstones that interfinger with the Kimmeridge
Clay Formation mudstones that further down-dip
are the source rock for the oil. The Magnus Member
Sandstone comprises 100-200 m of thickly bedded
turbidites deposited across the surface of the sub-
marine fan in poorly confined channels or as sheet
flows. There are minor slumps and low-density
turbidites which do not constitute net reservoir.
6.5.3 Approach
Once the first exploration well on the Magnus
prospect had been drilled, we would have at our
disposal a depth map of the structure based on
seismic data and calibrated by the well and wireline
logs, and core of the reservoir rock. How could we
predict the distributions of oil-in-place and reservoir
permeability? The first step would be to obtain a
relationship between porosity and depth so that the
depth map of the structure can be converted into a
porosity map. The key pieces of information that
provide a means of doing this are:
1 identification of quartz cement content as the
factor that determines reservoir porosity; and
2 the relationship between the timing of reservoir
filling with oil and quartz cement growth.
Both pieces of information can be obtained from
the core from a discovery well: the first from the
petrography of the reservoir sandstone plus stand-
ard core analysis and the second from fluid inclu-
sions in the quartz cement. Together, they permit
the porosity at the crest of the structure to be
estimated. The porosities at the crest and in the
discovery well can then be used to define a porosity-
depth relationship. The second step is to obtain a
relationship between porosity and permeability so
that the porosity map can be transformed into a
permeability map. The data required come from

are made on the same core plugs.
6.5.4 Controls on porosity and relationship of
cementation to oil filling
Core and sidewall core samples from the 'discovery'
well show that the Magnus Member Sandstone is
mineralogically simple and that the main control on
porosity is the volume of quartz cement. This can be
determined by point-counting the amount of quartz
cement in thin-sections and relating the amounts to
porosities obtained either from the same core plugs
(Fig. 6.29) or from wireline logs. The mean porosity
in 211/12-5 is 20.8 ± 0.5% (20-).
The quartz cement contains both aqueous and
petroleum fluid inclusions. Primary inclusions were
identified by the usual criterion: isolated occurrence
within an overgrowth. Secondary aqueous and petro-
leum inclusions along healed microfractures are also
present and can be observed crossing grains and
overgrowths. Measurements of solid final melting
and homogenization temperature are shown in Fig.
6.30. The homogenization temperatures of the petro-
leum inclusions are lower than those of aqueous
inclusions because of the greater compressibility of
the petroleum (see Section 3.3.3). The difference
need not imply that the two sets of inclusions were
trapped
at
different
temperatures.

These data come from all cored wells, not just 211/12-5.
There seems to be a weak relationship between the amount
of quartz cement determined by point-counting and the
helium porosity. It is unusual to obtain better correlations
with this kind of data due to the poor accuracy of the
point-counting.

within the quartz overgrowths, sometimes even
within the same overgrowth, suggests that quartz
grew in the presence of both petroleum and water,
as the reservoir filled with oil.
The conclusion that reservoir filling and quartz
cementation overlapped in time is an important one.
On a gross scale, sealed structures fill with oil from
top to bottom. If cement precipitation and filling are
partly synchronous, cement is likely to have less
time to grow towards the crest of the structure which
should therefore have higher porosity. Figure 6.31
shows how this may be used to establish a relation-
ship between porosity and depth. The depth map to
the top of the structure can then be transformed into
one that allows the prediction of the mean porosity
of a well drilled anywhere on the structure (Fig.
6.32). Provided that there is a good correlation
between porosity and permeability, it is a fairly

simple matter to transform the map once more so
that mean reservoir permeability can be predicted
(Fig. 6.33).
6.5.5 Conclusions
There are disadvantages in presenting a case study
carried out retrospectively and claiming that it
would have been possible to map porosity and
permeability after drilling a single discovery well
if only we had employed geochemists in 1974. At
best, the story tends to lack excitement; at worst,
credibility. There is however one advantage: the
outcome is known. Having drilled 26 wells, we
have an accurate picture of how mean porosity and
permeability in Magnus vary with depth. The cor-
respondence is shown in Figs 6.33 and 6.34. The
mean porosity for cored wells falls within 1% of the
prediction with two exceptions (the anomalous wells
had short core sections with unusually low propor-
tions of net: gross reservoir). The prediction of
permeability is accurate to a factor of better than
1.5. These predictions are quite accurate enough for
planning the locations of development wells and
calculating the volume of oil in the field.
The important question that this study raises
is not so much could we have produced maps of
reservoir quality for Magnus, but rather can we do it
for the next discovery and save ourselves some
appraisal wells? The applicability of the method will
be limited by a number of constraints. The sedi-
mentology of the reservoir must be fairly simple so
that porosity and permeability are determined by
diagenetic modification rather than sedimentary
facies variations. Equally, the more complex the
diagenesis, the less it is likely to be possible to
identify one mineral cement as a dominant influence
on reservoir quality. The best approach to a new
discovery would be to combine the methodology
described above with relative acoustic impedance
(RAI) mapping. AI is the product of rock density x
acoustic velocity and therefore depends partly on
porosity. With careful processing, it can be obtained
from
two-dimensional
exploration
seismic
data
so there is no reason why RAI cross sections of
a prospect should not be available even before
an exploration well is drilled. The problem with
AI is that it does not depend on porosity alone.
It therefore needs to be calibrated against mean
well porosity or be supported by other methods to
give absolute acoustic impedance (AAI). Sections
through Magnus show that AAI increases from
6600-7600 at the crest to 8000-9000 AAI units near
the oil-water contact. This could be explained by a
porosity decrease of about 7% but might also be due
to changes in sedimentary facies. If we had already
come up with the idea that porosity should decrease
from crest to flank due to an increase in the amount
of quartz cement, we would probably accept the first
explanation.

6.6 History of fracturing in a Chalk
reservoir: Machar Field, Central North Sea
6.6.1 Introduction
The Machar Field is located in the Central Graben
of the Central North Sea in UKCS block 23/26
almost due east of Aberdeen (Figs 1.1, 6.35 & 6.36).
It has two main reservoirs: a Palaeocene sand and
an Upper Cretaceous Chalk, both overlying a salt-
cored high at the edge of the graben, which is
responsible for the domed structure (Fig. 6.37). An
unusual celestite (SrS04) + siderite rock is found
between the Chalk and salt in some parts of the field

and has produced oil at substantial rates (7000
bbl.day-l in 23/26a-6Y). Seal is provided by Early
Tertiary mudstones.
In all Chalk reservoirs, matrix permeability is low
and oil can be produced at acceptable rates only if
the rock is fractured. This is generally the case in
Machar where several generations of fractures can
be observed in core. However, there is a further
complication: many fractures have been filled by
mineral cements, mainly calcite but occasionally
celestite. Far from contributing to permeability,
these filled fractures act as barriers to the flow of oil
into wells. Understanding the development of dif-
ferent types of fractures is therefore important
in order to site development wells and also to
design efficient schemes for completing wells for
production.
In this section, we describe a geochemical study
of calcite and celestite fracture fills. The aim of
the project was to obtain as much information as
possible about the origin of these cements in the
hope that we would be able to link them to phases in
the evolution of the Machar structure and ultimately
predict their distribution. We will return to Machar

6.6.2 Geological background
The Machar structure is a 4-way dip closure above a
dome of Permian Zechstein salt, divided into two
main segments by an extensional fault that down-
throws to the east (Foster & Rattey, in preparation;
Fig. 6.37). There is a condensed Mesozoic and Early
Tertiary section on top of the salt indicating that
for long periods it remained buoyant relative to
adjacent subsiding areas and that it is not principally
a piercement structure. Salt pillowing along the
graben margins began in the Triassic with erosion of
Triassic sediments. The Jurassic and Cretaceous-
Palaeocene stratigraphy is condensed: the Chalk is
a maximum of 300 m thick over the salt relative
to a regional thickness of more than 1000 m. The
presence
of slumping
and
resedimented
Chalk
suggests gravity sliding away from a high on the sea
bed at this time. By the Oligocene, the structure was
sealed and had begun to receive an oil charge from
the Kimmeridge Clay Formation off the flanks of the
dome. The only phase of true diapiric activity was
associated with Alpine inversion in the mid-Miocene
and is reflected in a pronounced unconformity and
onlap surface visible on seismic. Since the Miocene,
the entire area has subsided and is presently at its
maximum burial depth. A 10 m high bump on the
sea bed shows that the salt is still buoyant.
The most important oil reservoir is Cretaceous to
Early Palaeocene Chalk (which contains> 80% of
the oil-in-place) but there are reserves in an over-
lying Palaeocene sandstone and in the celestite 'cap
rock' (Fig. 6.38, p. 159). The Chalk is diagenetically
altered and its porosity declines downwards. Matrix
permeability is usually less than 1 mD but test
permeabilities can reach nearly 1 D due to the
presence of fractures. Flow into the wells tends to be
restricted to a small number of intensely fractured
zones which well tests show to be largely in pressure
communication.
6.6.3 Approach
Petrographic study of the calcite fracture fills in

revealed the existence of three
generations.
1 Type M: (earliest) microspar with no visible zona-
tion occupying very thin hair-line fractures.
2 Type B: blocky calcite, sometimes zoned, occupy-
ing thicker fractures that post-date type M calcites.
3 Type T: twinned and zoned calcite occupying the
thickest and latest fractures.
We carried out studies of the fluid inclusion contents
and stable and radiogenic isotopic compositions of
types B- and T-calcite and the rarer celestite fracture
fills. Type-M calcite did not contain any fluid inclu-
sions nor did it prove possible to isolate samples for
isotopic analysis. We hoped that the results would
reveal differences in the temperatures at which these
different fractures were cemented and the fluids
involved. Our aim was to link these diagenetic events
to the geological history of the Machar Field*.
6.6.4 Geochemistry of fracture fills I - fluid
inclusions
Types B- and T-calcite and celestite all contain
aqueous and petroleum fluid inclusions. Inclusions
usually contain either liquid petroleum + vapour or
water + vapour but sometimes spectacular three
phase liquid petroleum + water + vapour inclusions
can be found (Fig. 6.39). Many aqueous and petro-
leum inclusions were certainly trapped during min-
eral growth (see Fig. 3.3e) while others are clearly
secondary.
Measurements of ice final melting temperatures in
primary aqueous inclusions suggest that B- and T-
calcites grew from fluids of similar average salinity
(about 9-10eq. wt% NaCI; Fig. 6.40). The range of
salinities determined for the T-calcites is however
much greater. Celestite seems to have precipitated
from a far more saline fluid with an average salinity
of about 16%. There are also apparent differences
in the UVF characteristics of the petroleum inclu-
sions in the minerals. Those in both calcites fluoresce
mainly yellow-green to white; those in celestite
fluoresce green-blue to blue and are likely to be
more mature (higher API; see Section 3.5.4).
Homogenization
temperature distributions
for
primary fluid inclusions are shown in Fig. 6.41.
There is no significant difference between the dis-
tributions for aqueous inclusions in the two types of
calcite suggesting that the two grew over about the
same temperature range. Equally, the distributions
for petroleum inclusions are similar to those of
aqueous inclusions for both calcites. This means that

al., 1988; Jensenius and Burruss, 1990.

Fig. 6.40 Salinities of fluids from
which fracture filling minerals grew.
The box plots show distributions of
salinity for primary plus pseudo-
secondary fluid inclusions. Salinity
is expressed as eq. wt% NaCI and is
calculated from ice melting point
measurements (see Section 3.3.2).
Celestite grew from a more saline
fluid than did the calcite fracture fills
(16.1 ± 5.1 % [2aD. There is
virtually no difference in the mean
salinities of the fluids from which
the calcites grew, but T-calcite
precipitated from a fluid of more
variable salinity (10.4 ± 9.6%
relative to 9.1 ± 3.9%). For an
explanation of box plots, see Fig. 5.6.
provided that the inclusions have not leaked -
a
question that we will address in a moment - meas-
ured homogenization temperatures are in fact actual
trapping (mineral growth) temperatures. The pic-
ture for celestite is rather different. Although they
overlap with the range for T-calcite, aqueous inclu-
sion homogenization temperatures are significantly
higher suggesting growth at higher temperatures.
Before getting too excited about these data, par-
ticularly the aqueous inclusion homogenization tem-
peratures, it is important to give some thought to the
question of leakage. Inclusions in both calcite and
celestite would normally be susceptible to leakage if
heated significantly above their homogenization tem-
peratures. In Machar, this may not have happened
since the presence of primary petroleum inclusions
shows that both minerals are late diagenetic phe-
nomena. Some clues may also be obtained from the
data themselves. Figures 6.42 and 6.43 show that
there is no clear relationship betweenTh and either
depth or inclusion volume (although the absence of
such relationships does not prove that the inclusions

some relatively radiogenic values as high as 0.7083.
Type B-calcites also contain heavy carbon, but are
characterized by rather consistent 8180 indicating
precipitation over a restricted temperature range
from a single fluid. 87Sr/86Sr lies within the range for
unaltered Chalk indicating that the source of the Sr
was local.

6.6.6 Conclusions
The earlier of the calcite fracture fills, Type B, grew
from a water with a fairly constant salinity of about
9-10% in the presence of a relatively low maturity
petroleum and over a substantial range of temperat-
ures (from about 65 to 105°C). Strontium in the
calcite was derived from the surrounding Chalk but
carbon came from elsewhere. Type T-calcite grew
from a water with a wide range of salinity, also in
the presence of the same petroleum and over an
even wider temperature range (about 60-120°C).
Strontium came at least partially from a more radio-
genic source and there were at least two carbon
sources in addition to the Chalk itself. Celestite grew
from a highly saline fluid in the presence of a more
mature petroleum, between about 90 and 115°C. At
least part of its strontium was externally derived.
Up to a point, the geochemical work was quite
successful; certainly, it identified clear differences in
the conditions under which the different generations
of fracture fills grew. It is however difficult to take
the interpretation a step further and link the phases
of fracture filling to the evolution of the Machar
structure. The wide ranges of homogenization tem-
peratures, the evidence for external sources of
strontium and carbon and the presence of petroleum
during mineral growth all point to the existence of
important convection systems active during fracture
filling. With a large amount of water flowing around,
it is not safe to use a conductive heat flow model to
convert temperature into time as we have in several
of the case studies described in this chapter. We
cannot easily know when convection cells might
have raised temperatures as high as those recorded

by the fracture filling minerals. An estimate of
absolute mineral age can nonetheless be made, if in
a rather roundabout way, by modelling the genera-
tion history of the Kimmeridge Clay source rock off
the flanks of the Machar salt dome. Oil generation
began in the Oligocene and reached a peak in the
Miocene, the period of diapiric salt rise. All min-
erals studied contain primary petroleum inclusions,
so they are likely to have grown during this interval.
In all probability, most fracturing and fracture filling
is linked to this active diapirism.
It might reasonably be argued that this conclusion
could probably have been guessed without doing
any geochemical work at all. Perhaps the main
reason why the value of the work has been rather
limited is that the picture is genuinely extremely
complex. There are multiple carbon and strontium
sources and salinity is highly variable, all indicating
that several waters were involved in fracturing and
fracture filling, and all probably in a short time
during the Miocene. This represents less a failure of
applied science than bad geological luck.
6.7 Controls on permeability and the origin
of high-permeability streaks: Forties Field,
Central North Sea
6.7.1 Introduction
The Forties Field (Figs 1.1 & 6.35) was discovered in
the early stages of the exploration of the North
Sea in 1970 and originally contained 2480 Mbbl of
recoverable oil in Palaeocene sandstones (Lovell,
1990). The main producing reservoir zones are· in
the main both highly permeable and well connected,
so production from Forties has traditionally met
forecast levels without any requirement for detailed
reservoir studies. Production however reached a
peak and began to decline in the early 1980s and in
order to meet targets it has proved necessary to
improve the description of the reservoir. The most
important component of the new description has
been the interpretation of a newly acquired three-
dimensional
seismic survey.
Nonetheless,
some
features of the reservoir that have important impli-
cations for production are beyond the limits of
seismic resolution and must be tackled in other
ways. Amongst these are apparent high-permeability
'streaks' characterized by core plug permeabilities
from 3500 to as high as 8000 mD. The previous
reservoir model incorporated the streaks but there
was no geological explanation for them. Under-
Porosity and Permeability Prediction 165
standing their origin and distribution is important
because they are likely to act as conduits for injec-
tion waters; indeed, they were considered to be
important influences on the timing of breakthrough
of water into production wells.
This case history describes the use of image ana-
lysis of thin-sections of the Forties reservoir to in-
vestigate the controls on permeability in 'normal'
reservoir and in the high-permeability streaks.
6.7.2 Geological background
The Forties Field is a 4-way dip closure related
to drape over a NE-SW trending Mesozoic fault
block, the Forties-Montrose Ridge. Seal is pro-
vided by Eocene mudstones of the Sele Formation
(Figure 6.47; Parsley, 1990). The main reservoir
is the Palaeocene Forties Formation which was
deposited in the middle to lower parts of a sub-
marine fan system that evolved upwards from a
sand-rich type to a mixed sand-mud type. Oil, as
ever, is sourced by the Kimmeridge Clay Formation.
Forties
Formation
sandstones are
dominated
by monocrystalline quartz with subordinate poly-
crystalline quartz, feldspars and various lithic frag-
ments, and are mainly subarkoses (Fig.
6.48).
Detrital illite, chlorite or haematite coatings are
common. Diagenesis has been dominated by com-
paction and mineral cements generally make up less
than 3% of rock volume. Only ferroan calcite may
be abundant enough to exert a localized influence
on porosity. In general, the permeability of the
reservoir is very high and core plug measurements of
1000 - 2000 mD are not unusual.
6.7.3 Approach
This investigation of the controls on reservoir
quality in Forties Formation sandstones was based
on PIA. The technique was used to provide a quant-
itative description of the geometry both of the
pore network and of certain features of the detrital
rock fabric. In practice, this involved relating PIA
parameters to permeabilities measured on core
plugs using the standard method of mercury injec-
tion (Archer & Wall, 1986) in order to identify the
controls on permeability in normal reservoir and in
the high-permeability streaks. The expectation was
that the controls in the latter would be in some way
different and perhaps ultimately predictable.
Thirty samples of sandstone core were collected
from three wells (FB55, FA12 and FC22) and

algorithm to reconstruct grain boundaries at points
where two grains touch.
Distributions of pore and grain size for a typical
sample are shown in Fig. 6.49. Figure 6.50 shows
that for the entire sample set, there is a strong
correlation between median equivalent circular pore
diameter (ECD50) and permeability. ECD50 and
the 70th percentile of the grain size are also cor-
related (Fig. 6.51). The 70th percentile is chosen to
represent grain size because it corresponds to the
larger grain size mode of the bimodal grain size
distributions. The two correlations together suggest
that for most sandstones, permeability is strongly
influenced by median grain size. Multiple regression
of the PIA data and modal analysis shows that 94%
of the variance in permeability can be accounted
for by a combination of ECD50 and detrital clay
content (Fig. 6.52).
A glance at Fig. 6.51 will show that, perhaps
rather surprisingly, the high-permeability samples
do not have particularly high-variance pore or grain
size distributions. One possible explanation is that
their pore networks might be better connected in the
third dimension than those of the other samples and
that this is the feature that renders them anomalous.

Connectivity can be calculated for a sandstone by
a method known as series parallel modelling by
combining information from image analysis and
mercury injection (MacGowan, 1989). The resultant
connectivity (v) is a measure of the average number
of connected paths between pores. High values of v
indicate better connectivity and, in general, higher
permeability.
For the
Forties
Formation sand-
stones, v ranged from about 1 to 6 (Fig. 6.53). The
samples from the high-permeability streaks have
connectivities from 3 to 6, values which are not in
Fig. 6.53 Connectivity plotted against permeability.
6.7.5 Conclusions
This study came up with two main conclusions. The
first is that permeability in most samples of Forties
Formation sandstone is related almost entirely to
pore size (related in turn to grain size) with detrital
clay content having a small but detectable effect.
The second is that so-called high-permeability streak
samples do not have pore networks that are com-
patible with their measured permeabilities. Their
grain and pore size distributions are not particularly
high, nor do their pore systems appear to be anomal-
ously well connected. One is led to the conclusion
that there must be a non-matrix effect on perme-
ability. In this case, it is unlikely that natural frac-
tures are responsible. It is more probable that the
core plugs on which permeability was measured
were damaged, causing the rock fabric to come
apart.
the least extreme and characteristic more of perme-
abilities between about 1000 and 3000mD.
There remains one further possible explanation
for the origin of high permeabilities of the streak
samples: that for some reason, the critical diameter
at which mercury enters the sample upon injection is
anomalously large. Figure 6.54 shows that this is not
the case; again, the streak samples have critical
throat diameters more characteristic of samples with
permeabilities of up to 3000 mD.

7.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we will look at four case histories
that show how geochemical studies can be used
to characterize episodes of fluid migration through
sedimentary basins. Fluid migration is important in
petroleum exploration. This is self evident if the
fluid in question is oil or gas, but water migration is
of concern as well because of the effects that it may
have both on oil itself (water washing, biodegrada-
tion) and also on the rocks through which petroleum
must pass (diagenesis with consequent porosity and
permeability modification).
The most obvious manifestations of fluid migra-
tion are fluid inclusions. Subject to the limitations
described in Chapter 3, these can be analysed to
obtain information about the nature and origin of
the fluid. Inclusions can also provide an estimate of
the temperature and thus, indirectly, the time at
which the particular fluid was present. Diagenetic
minerals are the product of water-rock interaction
and so also have something to say about fluid type
and when and at what temperature it migrated
through the sample.
The first case history involves a single hand
specimen collected in the field (in fact from a
ploughed field) in the Aquitaine Basin, France. It
shows how water washing can be identified in petro-
leum fluid inclusions and illustrates how inclusions
can be useful even when their homogenization
temperatures are probably not recording trapping
temperatures. The second case history integrates
information
from
fluid
inclusions
with
mineral
isotope chemistry to characterize the conditions
under
which
a rather
odd
diagenetic
celestite
reservoir rock formed in the Machar Field in the
Central North Sea. So much information came out
of this work that it proved possible to specify the
actual cause of celestite growth and make a predic-
tion of its regional distribution. The third case his-
tory (not our own) describes how the distribution of
petroleum fluid inclusions in calcite cement in the
Great Oolite in the Weald Basin mirrored the dis-
tribution of oil accumulations, the implication being
that inclusion distribution can be used to map migra-

tion pathways. The final study - on the Waalwijk
gas-condensate
discovery
in
the
Roer
Graben,
Netherlands - involves the use of petrography and
diagenetic mineral geochemistry to constrain the
timing of petroleum migration into the structure.
7.2 History of petroleum migration from
outcrop samples: Aquitaine Basin, France
7.2.1 Introduction
The Aquitaine Basin is the most important petro-
leum producing basin in France (Fig. 7.1; Coustau
et al., 1970). Up to 1988, it had produced 75% ofthe
country's total post-war oil production of 500 Mbbl
and still produces 40% of her annual oil and 98% of
her annual gas output (Weaver &
VanDamme,
1988). In parts of the basin, there are few wells and
outcropping rocks are not well exposed. A field trip
party sent to one of these areas managed to find a
single sample of fractured micritic limestone in the
middle of a ploughed field. It turned out to be of
Albian age and approximately in situ. We set out to
see if there were any fluid inclusions in the fracture
filling carbonate
minerals
which
might
provide
information about the history of petroleum migra-
tion through the Albian sediments.
7.2.2 Geological background
The Mesozoic of the Aquitaine Basin can be divided
into four megasequences each of which is related to
a specific phase of relative motion between France
and Iberia and which rest on a Hercynian basement
(Fig. 7.2; Curnelle et al., 1982; Hiscott et al., 1990).
The pre-rift megasequence is of Triassic to Late
Jurassic age and comprises continental clastics over-
lain by thick evaporites and then Jurassic platform
carbonates. The syn-rift megasequence of latest
Jurassic to Albian age is related to the formation of
the Bay of Biscay and includes Lower Cretaceous
non- to shallow marine clastics and limestones and
thick Aptian to Albian carbonate platform sedi-
ments. It is terminated by an intra-Cenomanian
regional
unconformity associated with inversion
along extensional faults. As Iberia moved sinistrally
relative to France, a series of transtensional sub-
basins formed in which a post-rift megasequence
was deposited (Cenomanian to Palaeocene). Exten-
sional tectonics ended in the Eocene when Iberia
collided with France. The resulting foreland basin
megasequence includes Eocene flysch and Miocene
molasse.
The
present-day
configuration
of the
Aquitaine Basin is dominated by the Lower Creta-
ceous depocentre bounded to the north by a system
of salt ridges and to the south by the Pyrenean thrust
front and mid-Cretaceous inversion structures.
Source rocks are present in the Kimmeridgian but
the most important are in Lower Cretaceous car-
bonates which reached maturity over a wide area
during development of the foreland basin. Potential
carbonate reservoirs are widespread geographically
and through the stratigraphy but reservoir quality is
usually poor. Lower Aptian mudstones provide a

is an inversion structure of Cenomanian age. All
other known petroleum accumulations are in struc-
tures related to salt movement.
7.2.3 Approach
The approach taken in this study was straight-
forward. The first stage was to characterize the
numerous types of fracture-fills in the sample and
establish their relative chronology. The second was
to search for fluid inclusions and relate groups of
inclusions both to one another and also to the
episodes of fracture filling. Suitable inclusions were
then analysed by microthermometry and, in the case
of petroleum inclusions, by GCMS. Bitumen in the
pore spaces in open fractures was analysed by GC
and GCMS.
7.2.4 Fluid inclusions: petrography,
microthermometry and GeMS analysis
A petrographic study of the sample showed that
there were five phases of fracturing and filling with
ferroan or non-ferroan calcite. The earliest two
generations are filled by very fine-grained calcite and
contain no visible fluid inclusions. However in the
latest
three
generations
of calcite
fracture-fills
(named C, D and E), there are three main types of
fluid inclusions, all containing liquid plus a vapour
bubble:
1 aqueous;
2 orange-coloured liquid petroleum + vapour; and
3 colourless liquid petroleum + vapour.
Each of these three groups included inclusions that
appeared to be primary and others that were clearly
secondary.
The
colourless
petroleum
fluoresces
strongly under UV light, usually with a blue to
blue-green colour, but the orange petroleum shows
only very weak fluorescence.
All
three
generations of fracture-fills
contain
aqueous inclusions but petroleum inclusions are not
uniformly distributed between them (Table 7.1).
Type C fracture fills contain colourless petroleum
inclusions but none of the orange coloured variety.
In contrast, Type D fracture-fills contain orange
petroleum inclusions, but only very few colourless
petroleum inclusions. Occasionally, a third, liquid
water phase could be seen rimming. the orange
petroleum.
The
latest
(Type
E)
fracture-filling
calcites contain both types of petroleum inclusions.
The colourless petroleum was never found associ-
ated with liquid water.
A total of 62 fluid inclusions were studied by
microthermometry (Fig. 7.3). Orange petroleum
inclusions homogenize at temperatures above about
45°C. Primary inclusions show a well defined mode
between 45 and 50°C, while the distribution for
secondary inclusions is broader with a mode be-
tween 75 and 80°C. Colourless petroleum inclusions
and aqueous inclusions both show wide ranges of
homogenization temperatures with no well defined
mode. Ice final melting temperatures however show
a more systematic distribution. Types C and E
fracture-fills contain relatively saline aqueous inclu-
sions containing about 8 eq. wt% NaCI while inclu-
sions in the intermediate Type D fracture fills contain
virtually fresh water (1 eq. wt% NaCI; Table 7.1).
Type D calcite fracture-fills were isolated for
analysis of the petroleum in the inclusions. The
samples were dominated by the orange petroleum.
Unfortunately, it proved impossible to obtain a
volume of petroleum large enough to produce a GC
trace. However, crushing the calcite under solvent
provided sufficient material for limited whole-oil
GCMS analysis (Fig. 7.4). Features of the m/z =
191 fragmentogram in particular allow the inclusion
petroleum to be correlated with other oils from
producing fields in the Aquitaine Basin and with the
bitumen in the pores of the outcrop sample. All

are likely to have come from the same Mesozoic
carbonate source rock. Molecular maturity para-
meters calculated from the GeMS fragmentograms
do not constrain the temperature of oil expulsion
from the source rock with any great accuracy, but
suggest a figure between 110 and 140°C.
What can we make of these data? It would be a
brave person who would ascribe much significance
to the homogenization temperatures. The wide
spread of the data and the fact that the mineral host
is calcite suggest that the aqueous inclusions may
well have leaked. This may also be true of the
petroleum inclusions. Two features of the data in
Fig. 7.3 however suggest that the homogenization
temperatures of at least the orange petroleum
inclusions may still be reflecting trapping temperat-
ures: the fairly tight distribution of Th for primary
inclusions and the different Th distributions for
primary and secondary inclusions. Even if this were
true, trapping temperatures would be difficult to
estimate because the (probably substantial) pressure
correction cannot be accurately determined. If the

176 Chapter 7
aqueous inclusions have leaked, ice final melting
temperatures may still faithfully record salinity. Two
features of the data suggest an association between
low salinity (indeed virtually fresh) water and the
orange petroleum:
1 the restriction of low salinity aqueous inclusions
to Type D fracture-fills which contain abundant
orange petroleum inclusions; and
2 the existence of water + orange petroleum +
vapour inclusions (water was never observed in the
colourless petroleum inclusions).
The orange colour of the petroleum in these inclu-
sions may well be caused by removal of light alkanes
by fresh water (a process known as water washing).
This could also dissolve the aromatic hydrocarbons
that are responsible for fluorescence, explaining the
low intensity of fluorescence shown by this petro-
leum when illuminated by UV light.
7.2.5 Conclusions
Several conclusions can be drawn from the fluid
inclusion study. The most obvious is that the car-
bonate source rock that was responsible for filling
other producing oilfields in the basin was also
producing oil in the area in which the sample was
picked up, where there was virtually no rock ex-
posed at surface and no drill core. In this particular
case, the same conclusion could have been drawn
simply from the presence of bitumen in the pores.
However, pore-filling bitumen can sometimes be so
heavily biodegraded in outcrop samples that correla-
tion with other oils is impossible; it may even be
completely removed by weathering. Fluid inclusions
would then have been the only way of demonstrat-
ing a working oil source system. The second sig-
nificant conclusion is the
recognition of water
washing from the association of orange (probably
altered) petroleum inclusions with fresh water. This
suggests that at least one migration pathway was
connected to surface and raises concerns about
the quality of any petroleum that might be found in
the area and also about seal effectiveness. The
presence of bitumen in the pores does not demon-
strate water washing during some past phase of oil
migration because it might equally well be, and
probably largely is, a product of recent near-surface
weathering.
As is sometimes the case, the postscript is some-
what disappointing. BP is no longer exploring in the
Aquitaine Basin.
7.3 Prediction of the occurrence of
diagenetic celestite cap rock:
Central North Sea
7.3.1 Introduction and approach
Those who have read Chapter 6 will remember the
Machar Field in the Central North Sea. Those who
have not should read about the geology of the field
before embarking on this case history. It is based
on a geochemical study of an unusual diagenetic
reservoir rock composed almost entirely of celestite
(strontium sulphate). Although the bulk of the
reserves in Machar are in fractured Chalk, some
oil is contained in a highly porous and permeable
celestite 'cap rock' which is found between the
Chalk and a unit of Zechstein anhydrite that rests
above the salt dome (see Figs 6.38 & 6.39). DST
no. 1 in well 23/26a-6Y tested oil at 7000 bbl.day-l
from the celestite.
The high permeability of the celestite cap rock
together with the presumed large area of its inter-
face with the Chalk led to the suggestion that by
completing production wells within the cap rock, it
might be possible to drain the Chalk reservoir more
effectively than would be possible by completing
within the zones of fractured Chalk. The celestite
therefore assumed an importance disproportionate
to the small proportion of the field's reserves that it
contains.
We set out to predict which of the similar untested
prospects within the Central North Sea might have a
celestite cap rock. Our approach was to analyse
samples of cap rock for strontium, oxygen and
sulphur isotope compositions and to study its fluid
inclusion contents in the hope that we might be able
to identify the cause of celestite cap rock formation.
7.3.2 Conditions and cause of celestite precipitation
Table 7.2 lists strontium, sulphur and oxygen iso-
tope analyses of celestite from well 23/26a-l. The
isotopic ratio of the strontium provides information
about the source of the strontium and the isotopic
ratios of sulphur and oxygen do the same for the
sulphate. &180 lies between 13.3 and 13.9%0 and &34S
between 14.8 and
15.60/00.
87Sr/86Sr is between
0.70784 and 0.70789. Also listed in the table are
analyses of samples of anhydrite dissolved out of
core samples of halite. These are Permian Zechstein
evaporites and have quite distinct isotope ratios.

The strontium in the celestite is much more radio-

come from another source with 87Sr/86Sr > 0.70789.
This value also precludes unaltered Chalk which has
87Sr/86Sr < 0.70774 (see Fig. 6.47). The most likely
candidate is a formation water that had passed
through clastic rocks and obtained its strontium
by dissolving old and/or Rb-rich detrital minerals
such as micas or feldspars. The sulphate in the
celestite cannot have come entirely from Zechstein
evaporites either, as both b180 and b34S are 4-5%0
heavier (more positive) than Late Permian seawater
sulphate (Claypool et al., 1980).
The fluid inclusions found in celestite fracture fills
and cap rock were described in Section 6.7.4. There
are primary aqueous and petroleum fluid inclusions
that suggest growth of the mineral from a highly
saline water (average 16 eq. wt%NaCI) in the
presence of a mature petroleum, at temperatures
between about 90 and 115°C.
The geochemical evidence shows then that celestite
grew at high temperatures from a saline water that
contained radiogenic
strontium
and isotopically
heavy sulphate, neither of which could have had a
local origin. The presence of primary fluid inclusions
containing oil sourced by the Kimmeridge Clay
Formation indicates a connection between the top of
the salt dome and the deeply buried Jurassic section
and suggests that the water that caused celestite cap
rock to form could have originated in the Mesozoic,
off the flanks of the dome. But what caused the
Fluid Migration 177
mineral to precipitate? Celestite solubility may be
written:
SrS04 = Sr2+ + sol-
Ksp = [Sr2+] . [SOl-] at equilibrium
Ksp is the solubility product; [Sr2+] and [SOl-]
are the ionic activities of strontium and sulphate.
Celestite will precipitate from solution if the actual
ionic activity product (lAP) > Ksp• This can come
about in only a limited number of ways.
1 Change in Ksp• Pressure or temperature variation
can cause Ksp to fall below lAP and precipitation
will ensue.
2 Change lAP. (a) Changing activity coefficients
(factors which relate activity to concentration) by
altering ionic strength (equivalent to salinity).
3 Change lAP. (b) Increasing the concentrations of
dissolved sulphate and/or dissolved strontium so
that lAP increases.
Simply moving a formation water to a structurally
higher position above the salt dome at lower P and T
(1) cannot cause celestite precipitation because, for
celestite, Ksp increases with decreasing temperature.
Dissolution would be more likely. Increasing the
ionic strength of the formation water through salt
dissolution (2) is not a plausible precipitation mech-
anism either as this too would increase celestite
solubility. There is however a geologically plausible
and simple way in which a formation water arriving
at the top of the Machar dome could have acquired
additional sulphate and some strontium (3). If
such a water were undersaturated with anhydrite, it
would begin to dissolve the anhydrite that caps the
halite: Ca2+ and sol- as well as some sc2+ would
go into solution and cause celestite - orders of mag-
nitude less soluble than anhydrite - to precipitate.
This mechanism is compatible with the isotopic con-
straint that at least some of the strontium and the
sulphate of which the celestite is composed was not
locally derived.
7.3.3 Simulation ofcelestite precipitation
To evaluate the suggested cause ofcelestite precipita-
tion, we simulated reaction of 20 Central North Sea
Mesozoic formation waters with anhydrite, using a
computer program for the calculation of chemical
equilibria*. The calculations were carried out 'at

waters were selected from a total database of 113 using

100°C to honour the fluid inclusion data and at 1
bar total pressure (for convenience only; pressure
has little effect on the results). The first stage in
the simulation was equilibration of the water with
anhydrite and barite. This is necessary to remove
barium from solution: barite is so insoluble that if
any Ba2+ is present in the water, as soon as anhydrite
dissolves, barite will precipitate instead of celestite.
The second stage is reaction of the water with
anhydrite and celestite.
Of the 20 waters used in the simulation, 12 pre-
cipitated celestite upon reaction with anhydrite
(Fig. 7.5; Table 7.3). The formation water that
precipitated most celestite per unit volume was from
well 23/26a-7, the closest well to the Machar dome,
which dissolved 2077 mg.I- 1 of anhydrite and pre-
cipitated 2810 mg.I- 1 of celestite. Celestite is con-
siderably denser than anhydrite so this reaction in
fact creates porosity (which may explain the high
porosity of the celestite cap rock).
7.3.4 Conclusions
The geochemical study of the Machar celestite cap
rock has identified the probable mechanism by
which this bizarre diagenetic reservoir rock formed.

tion interest, it has proved possible to begin to
delineate parts of the basin where a cap rock of this
type could, and where it could probably not, have
formed. Although we do not have retrospective
knowledge about the actual distribution of celestite
cap rocks in the Central North Sea, in our view this
represents an almost uniquely successful outcome to
a geochemical project. Unfortunately, we cannot
claim all the credit. The success is due in large
measure to the fact that celestite is composed entirely
of geochemical tracers, a geochemist's dream. In the
case of celestite, strontium and sulphate are not just
present in trace amounts but are the major com-
ponents of the
mineral.
Furthermore, celestite
chemistry is simple so that there is only a small
number of processes that can cause it to precipitate.
Pulling the same rabbit out of the hat for other
diagenetic minerals is far from easy.
7.4 Regional mapping of migration
pathways: Weald Basin, onshore UK
7.4.1 Introduction and approach
The Weald Basin is located in south-east England,
south of the London-Brabant Massif (Fig. 7.6).
It contains a number of small oil accumulations
sourced by mudstones of the Lower Jurassic Lias
and mainly reservoired in the Bathonian Great
Oolite. During the late 1980s, there was a consider-
able amount of exploration interest in the Weald
even to the extent of drilling close to the author's
home in Guildford and in Winnie the Pooh's wood
in Sussex (Milne, 1928). Oil accumulations do not
however appear to be distributed throughout the
basin. The case study that we will describe here
involves an attempt to explain the distribution of oil
pools by defining migration pathways based on the
presence or absence of petroleum fluid inclusions in
late diagenetic ferroan calcite cement (McLimans &
Videtich, 1987, 1989).
7.4.2 Geological background
Most of the oil in the Weald Basin is contained in
carbonate grainstones of the Great Oolite Forma-
tion. This unit comprises a number of facies of which
the best reservoirs are oolitic grainstones which
are widely distributed across the basin (Fig. 7.6;
Sellwood et al., 1989). Early diagenesis in the
meteoric environment is thought to have influenced
porosity by stabilizing the ooids through precipita-
tion of a fringe cement and by causing alteration of
aragonite and high-Mg calcite grains to low-Mg

calcite. Porosity is however largely controlled by a
sparry calcite cement which is slightly ferroan and
which is the latest cement to have formed.
7.4.3 Fluid inclusions in ferroan calcite cement
McLimans and Videtich (1987) collected 75 grain-
stone samples from 11 wells. The latest, ferroan
calcite cement contained aqueous and petroleum
fluid inclusions. Most inclusions were either aqueous
or petroleum but a few contained both liquids (as
well as the customary vapour bubble). Sometimes,
the inclusions were clearly secondary; sometimes
they appeared to be primary. The preferred inter-
pretation of the textural relationships was that pre-
cipitation of the calcite cement and oil migration
were broadly contemporaneous.
Homogenization temperatures for fluid inclusions
ranged from below 50 to over l30°C (Fig. 7.7). The
authors presented a smoothed frequency distribu-
tion representing nearly 600 Th determinations,
but without making it clear which inclusions were
represented (aqueous and petroleum in one histo-
gram?) and at the same time admitting that the
measurements differed from well to well. This
makes it impossible to evaluate the subsequent

claim that the inclusions suggest calcite precipitation
at temperatures between 80 and 105°C (those who
have read Chapter 3 may be unwilling to take this on
trust). Nonetheless, an important conclusion did
come out of this comprehensive survey and was
drawn simply from the presence or absence of petro-
leum inclusions. It proved possible to map areas
with and without these inclusions in the late calcite
cement. Only in the south-western part of the basin
did the calcite consistently contain petroleum inclu-
sions (Fig. 7.8). This part of the basin was mature

the occurrence of the right type of fluid inclusions.
The exploration significance of this study in the
Weald Basin was presumably limited by the need to
drill a large number of wells to collect the samples
to make the map. The technique might however
be far more useful in surface mapping of poorly
explored basins where inclusions may provide the
only samples of migrated petroleum not oxidized by
weathering (see also the Aquitaine Basin example in
Section 7.2).

7.5 Filling history of a reservoir:
Waalwijk, onshore Netherlands
7.5.1 Introduction
The Roer Graben is in the southern part of The
Netherlands (Fig. 7.9, p. 181). One of the keys to
prospectivity in the graben is the timing of structure
formation relative to oil generation. The age of oil
generation is usually determined by combining a
burial history for a well or depth-converted seismic
shot point with a kinetic description of kerogen
breakdown (Quigley & Mackenzie, 1988). In the
Roer Graben, this is not straightforward for two
reasons. Firstly, increased heat flow associated with
rifting in the mid-Jurassic about 160 Ma ago may
have raised temperatures enough to cause petroleum
generation from the Lias source rock. Secondly,
Early Tertiary inversion led to the erosion of a
substantial amount of Cretaceous sediment so that
it is difficult to estimate the highest temperatures
attained prior to erosion.
Waalwijk-1, an exploration well drilled in 1987
discovered gas-condensate reservoired in Triassic
Bunter sandstone. The uncertainties associated with
modelling the timing of oil generation meant that
the reservoir could have received its oil charge
in the Middle Jurassic during rifting, in the Late
Cretaceous before inversion or in the Late Tertiary
to Recent. We set out to determine whether there
was any feature of the diagenesis of the Bunter
sandstones in Waalwijk that could constrain the
timing of petroleum filling.
7.5.2 Geological background
The Roer Graben is the south-easterly extension of
the West Netherlands Basin. During deposition
of the Triassic Bunter sandstones, the graben was
bounded to the south by the Brabant Massif and to
the east by the Rhenish Massif. The Bunter Forma-
tion, which includes the main reservoirs, comprises
conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones deposited
by laterally extensive sheet-floods. The structure
drilled at Bunter level is an elongate tilted fault block
(Fig. 7.10). Upper Triassic mudstones, dolomites

post-dates all of the features on the diagram. The
most significant observation from the point of view
of petroleum filling is the identification of bitumen
at a consistent point in the paragenesis. The bitumen
post-dates illite cement growth but is overgrown by
ferroan carbonate cements. Bitumen emplacement
cannot itself be dated but its age can be bracketed if
earlier illite and later carbonate cements can be
dated.

7.5.3 Approach
We first carried out a detailed petrographic study to
identify the diagenetic minerals and events rep-
resented in the Bunter sandstone reservoir and to
establish their timing relative to one another. We
then decided which geochemical methods should be
applied to which mineral cements in an attempt to
affix some absolute ages to the relative ages of the
paragenetic sequence in the hope that this would in
turn constrain the age of phases of oil migration.
Illite cement turned out to be quite abundant in
the sandstone and could be dated using the K- Ar
method. No other cement could be dated directly so
we attempted to constrain precipitation temperat-
ures by analysing the stable isotope ratios of illite,
non-ferroan and ferroan dolomite cements and
present-day formation water.

8180 < -11.1roo and a non-ferroan end-member
8180> -1.9roo (Fig. 7.14). Figure 7.15 is a plot of
water oxygen isotope ratio against temperature.
Mineral oxygen isotope ratio is a function of these
two variables so a measured mineral 8180
value
plots as a curve. The curves represent the range of
illite and ferroan and non-ferroan dolomite 0180
measurements. There are two other points on the
graph. The present-day formation water (0180 =
-3.5roo) is plotted at the present reservoir temperat-
isotope analysis and the results are shown in Fig.
7.12 (p. 183) and Table 7.4. Sample purity was
monitored by TEM. The < 0.2 Jlm size fractions
contained only elongate illite fibres that appeared to
be diagenetic while coarser fractions were invariably
mixtures of the same fine fibres with platy and
ragged illite crystals, probably detrital. Coarser
separates have distinctly older K-Ar ages which also
indicates the presence of old detrital minerals. The
highly precise ages of the < 0.2 Jlm size fractions
from the three samples are close together and may
reasonably be interpreted to indicate an age of
about 130-140 Ma for illite cement growth (early
Cretaceous). This represents a maximum age for
early oil emplacement.
To estimate a minimum age for early oil emplace-
ment, we had to adopt a rather different approach
involving interpreting mineral oxygen isotope ratios
in terms of temperature. To do this, we need to
know or be able to constrain the oxygen isotope
ratio of the water or waters from which the minerals
precipitated. This cannot be done for anyone min-
eral in isolation. Instead, we need to build up a
picture of how the porewater isotope ratio has
evolved through time using information from both
hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of diagenetic
minerals and of present-day formation water.

water evolution path. The original ()180 0 f the water
from which illite precipitated is calculated from the
illite hydrogen isotope ratio of about -600/00. Waters
in equilibrium with illite are about 300/00 heavier; a
meteoric water with ()D = - 300/00 would have ()180
= -50/00 (see Section 4.3.1). The area on the graph
representing the conditions of illite cement growth is
further constrained by estimating the temperature in
the Bunter during the Lower Cretaceous (70-80°C).
Waters in sedimentary basins tend to evolve towards
more positive ()180 because they undergo isotope
exchange with minerals which are relatively iso-
topically heavy. The simplest path for water isotopic
evolution is therefore some kind of curve which
moves towards the right from waters present during
early diagenesis and passing through areas represent-
ing mineral growth conditions, ending at present-
day formation waters. This path is shown as a broad
arrow on Fig. 7.15.

The water evolution path can be used to estimate
precipitation temperatures for minerals whose oxy-
gen isotope ratio has been measured. For ferroan
dolomite, a figure above about 80°C is indicated; for
non-ferroan dolomite, a figure less than about 25°C.
Note that the latter is at odds with the position of
non-ferroan dolomite in the paragenesis (Fig. 7.11).
In fact, the path for water isotope evolution cannot
be as simple as that shown on Fig. 7.15. For a start,
there was inversion in the Early Tertiary which
would have caused cooling so that the evolution
path would have to backtrack at some point and
move vertically back up the diagram. Furthermore,
in an area with a complex geological history like
the Roer Graben, we cannot be at all certain that
the same formation water has been in the Bunter
Sandstone, gently evolving for 200 Ma. These un-
certainties seriously limit the value of oxygen isotope
ratios as palaeo-temperature indicators in this and
many similar cases.
7.5.5 Conclusions
K-Ar dating of illite cement in the Bunter sand-
stone of the Waalwijk gas-condensate reservoir
plausibly indicates a maximum age of Early Creta-
ceous for early filling of the structure by petroleum.
This information partly answers the question set
at the start of the study. An Early Cretaceous
age for the illite -
which itself pre-dates early oil
emplacement and carbonate cementation -
shows
that the gas-condensate now in the reservoir was not
generated during the mid-Jurassic. It cannot dis-
tinguish between possible Late Cretaceous and Late
Tertiary episodes of generation. The status of the
bitumen remains somewhat unclear. It may rep-
resent oil generated in the Late Cretaceous that was
subsequently flushed out only for the structure to be
filled by gas-condensate in the Late Tertiary, after
dolomite cementation (this is however somewhat
speculative).
Attempts to constrain the diagenetic and filling
history of the Bunter sandstone more accurately by
stable isotope analysis of mineral cements were not
particularly successful. As is so often the case, this
was due to the uncertainty associated with estimat-
ing water isotope composition. If we were under-
taking the analytical programme today, we would
use a laser for isotopic analysis of the carbonates.
This would provide a much more detailed and
accurate picture of the isotopic composition of the
several minerals present in the sandstone. Nonethe-
less, it would probably not provide better estimates
of cement growth temperature because however
accurate
(5180
measurements may be, there will
remain the unquantifiable uncertainty about water
(5 180. The accuracy of the temperature estimates
depends entirely on assumptions that are virtually
impossible to assess.

8.1 Introduction
Correlation can be thought of as the linking of rock
units that have something in common. Usually, the
linkage involves common properties such as age,
lithology and reservoir parameters such as porosity,
permeability and reservoir pressure. In this chapter,
we will also consider the correlation of clastic rock
units with their sediment source areas (provenance
studies) and the correlation of the isotopic properties
of rock units with known global curves (or secular
curves)
developed
for
several
isotopic systems
throughout the Phanerozoic.
.
The objective of this chapter is to introduce the
rationale behind correlation of rock properties and
to outline the essential information a good correla-
tion can provide for petroleum exploration and pro-
duction. The bulk of the chapter comprises a series
of case studies demonstrating the effectiveness (or
otherwise) of inorganic geochemistry in helping to
correlate.
Inorganic geochemical techniques can
assist in reservoir correlation on all scales, from
exploration through to development and produc-
tion. The first case history in this chapter describes
the use of strontium isotope stratigraphy to improve
the correlation of the Tertiary sediments in the
Norwegian North Sea. The second describes how
oxygen isotopes have been used in much the same
way in the Gulf of Mexico, though only in the
(admittedly thick) Plio-Pleistocene. The last two
case histories are on a smaller scale. The first of
these describes the use of strontium isotope analyses
of rock and formation water to understand how the
Chalk reservoir in the Ekofisk Field (Central North
Sea) is compartmentalized. The final case history in
this chapter -
a study of the Gullfaks Field in
the Northern North Sea - shows how Sm-Nd iso-
topes can provide qualitative information on the
continuity
of sandbodies
deposited
within
the
same sediment dispersal systems and supplement
deterministic information available from lous and
core.

Fig. 8.1 Biostratigraphic schemes
for planktonic and larger benthic
foraminifera, Miocene to Holocene
(from Haq etal., 1987). Miocene
shallow water carbonate platforms
in Indonesia tend not to contain
abundant planktonic forams. The
zonation scheme based on benthic
forams has a poorer resolution.

independent microfossil experts is used, results may
not always be easily comparable.
Isotope
stratigraphy can
provide
a
tool
for
stratigraphic correlation when the intrinsic and
practical problems associated with conventional
biostratigraphic correlation are severe. Taking the
example of the Early Miocene carbonate platform
in Indonesia, if we were to sample diagenetically
unaltered carbonate fossils of any type and deter-
mine their 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio, we could poten-
tially date most of the samples to ±1Ma using the Sr
isotopic evolution curve for Tertiary seawater (Fig.
8.2). This would permit good cross-platform cor-
relation. If the carbonate platform happened to be
of Late Miocene age, however, the flattening of the
isotope evolution curve and the 'u' shape at approx-
imately 7Ma would render this method less appro-
priate because its precision would be poor (see also
Fig. 5.21). There would also be little value in using
the Sr isotope method on samples from which no
other information is available because the Sr isotope
curve for the whole of the Phanerozoic contains
several rises and falls of the ratio (Section 5.5.5;
Burke et al., 1982). An 87Sr/86Sr measurement of
0.708000, gives eight possible ages ranging from
Ordovician through to Tertiary! A further problem
with strontium isotope stratigraphy (and indeed any
isotope stratigraphic method) is the impact of dia-
genesis on the depositional isotopic signature. Dis-
solution, neomorphism and cement precipitation
may have a profound effect on the original isotopic
signature, and petrographic screening of sample
material prior to analysis is an essential prerequisite.
Oxygen, carbon and sulphur isotopes can also be
used for stratigraphic purposes. All require sample
material of diagenetically unaltered marine origin,
8.2 Stratigraphic correlation
Stratigraphic correlation is the linking together of
rock units of similar age. In the oil industry, the
most commonly applied stratigraphic techniques
are seismic stratigraphy (Vail et al., 1977) and,
where rock samples are available, biostratigraphy.
Magnetostratigraphy (which requires core samples)
and
isotope
stratigraphy
(also
requiring
rock
samples) are less commonly used.
Seismic stratigraphy is arguably one of the most
exciting
developments
in
petroleum
geoscience
in the last two decades (Vail et al., 1977; Berg
& Woolverton, 1985; Wilgus et al., 1988). It is a
methodology which can be used to interpret seismic
in the absence of well data and relies on recognizing
key geometries at seismic reflector terminations,
relying on the important (and not entirely proven)
hypothesis that most seismic reflectors correspond
to stratigraphic time-lines.
Where rock (usually
well) samples are available, biostratigraphy has
been and will continue to be the standard method of
stratigraphic correlation. Industrial biostratigraphy
is almost entirely based on microfossil zonation
schemes because it is not usual to drill through and
core an ammonite. Furthermore, many microfossil
species, particularly pelagic forms, evolved rela-
tively rapidly, permitting fine stratigraphic sub-
division in many parts of the Mesozoic and Tertiary.
Micropalaeontology can also provide information
about depositional environments (Hedgpeth, 1957).
Biostratigraphy suffers from several drawbacks,
both intrinsic and practical. The main intrinsic dif-
ficulties arise when rock successions have no age-
diagnostic fossils and where fossil assemblages are
strongly facies- or province-dependent. An example
of poor stratigraphic
resolution
resulting
from
the absence of age-diagnostic fossils and facies-
dependence is the benthic foraminiferal scheme for
the Miocene (Fig. 8.1). If, for example, we were to
drill wells on an Early Miocene carbonate platform
in Indonesia, where the bulk of the microfauna
would comprise benthic foraminifera, our resolving
power would only be about 3-4 Ma on average,
and our biostratigraphic correlation would be cor-
respondingly imprecise. A practical difficulty with
biostratigraphy,
particularly
in
the
petroleum
industry, is the absence of a uniform system of
criteria to recognize series or subseries boundaries
(Goll & Skarbo, 1990). This would not matter if
a single analyst performed all the microfossil iden-
tifications but if, as is more usual, a whole range of

either as fossils or as inorganic precipitates from
seawater. Oxygen isotope stratigraphy has been
very successfully applied in sediments deposited in
the glacial-interglacial rhythms of the last 4 Ma
or so. One hundred and fifty two oxygen isotopic
stages have been recognized globally, giving an
average resolution of 26000 years (Trainor et al.,
1988). As well as providing very high resolution,
the method can be used to relate sediment flux to
episodes of glaciation or deglaciation, providing an
insight into the controls on sediment transport. By
sampling and analysing both pelagic and benthic
microfossils, clues to ancient bottom water circula-
tion and seawater stratification can be obtained.
Two
major
disadvantages with
oxygen
isotope
stratigraphy are the nature of the record itself and
the impact of diagenesis on isotope compositions.
Because the record of seawater oxygen isotope com-
positions fluctuates between small negative and
small positive values, the composition at anyone
time is not unique (Fig. 8.3). Unless a continuous
sample record is available, oxygen isotope strati-
graphy cannot be used alone as a stratigraphic tool
and requires a coarse calibration with biostratigraphy
or strontium isotopes. Diagenetic alteration will also
render the oxygen isotopic method virtually useless
where complete or even partial alteration of the
sediments has taken place. Oxygen isotope strati-
graphy is usually restricted to deeper-water Pliocene
to Recent deposits, largely because the effects of
diagenesis obscure the depositional record before
this time and because the amplitude of glacio-eustatic
sea-level fluctuations -
and hence the range of
oxygen isotopic compositions -
was less extreme
prior to Plio-Pleistocene glaciations.
Carbon isotopes can also be used as a stratigraphic
tool, although they are rather more difficult to inter-
pret than oxygen isotopes (e.g. Leggett, 1985). The
carbon isotopic composition of seawater recorded
by calcareous tests of marine organisms results from
the interplay of two main processes: fixation of
l3C-rich carbon in carbonate rocks and of 12C-rich
carbon in marine organic sediments produces a
cyclicity rather like that displayed by oxygen iso-
topes. The record includes features such as the
terminal Miocene event related to the desiccation of
the Mediterranean and carbon isotopic excursions
related to oceanic anoxic events (Scholle & Arthur,
1980). These can be used for a coarse stratigraphic
correlation. As with oxygen isotopes, however, the
carbon isotopic composition of sediments may be
greatly affected by diagenetic processes and any
carbon isotopic analysis for stratigraphic purposes
must take account of dissolution, neomorphism and
precipitation of later cements.
The marine sulphate sulphur and oxygen isotope
secular curves are less well constrained than sea-
water oxygen and carbon curves, though they do go
back further. They can only be used for very coarse
correlation
of marine
evaporites
(Section
4.5;
Claypool et al., 1980).
One of the more obvious ways of using isotopes to
correlate stratigraphically is by obtaining absolute
ages of sedimentation by using radiogenic isotopes.
Unfortunately, radiometric clocks are not generally
reset at sediment deposition;
mineral ages will
tend to reflect either provenance or diagenesis and
whole rock ages will generally be pretty meaning-
less. One mineral which can be used to date sedi-
ments directly is glauconite which precipitates in the
marine environment, and is found in both siliciclastic
and carbonate rocks. Glauconite can be dated using
both Rb-Sr and K-Ar systems (Section 5.5.6) but
is susceptible to diagenetic alteration, particularly
by freshwater flushing, so that care must be taken
in interpreting glauconite ages if subaerial expo-
sure of the sediment is believed to have occurred.

Recently, attempts have been made to date the
deposition
of Precambrian and
Palaeozoic car-
bonates using the Pb-Pb technique (Moorbath
et al., 1987). This has apparently been quite success-
ful on Precambrian stromatolites, although it is
difficult to know whether the dates are genuinely
depositional and of stratigraphic significance, or
whether diagenesis is being recorded.
The appropriate techniques to apply for strati-
graphic correlation in petroleum geology are criti-
cally dependent on the nature of the material
available and the depositional environment and
broad stratigraphic age of the sediments of interest.
If we only have seismic lines available, clearly
seismic stratigraphy is our only tool. If we have
seismic and well data available, we can choose
between
dating the seismic reflectors
biostrati-
graphically and/or using isotope chronostratigraphy.
In areas where age-diagnostic fossils are present
Correlation 191
and assemblages are unlikely to be affected by pro-
vinciality or be strongly facies-dependent, biostrati-
graphy should be used. Where these criteria are not
fulfilled, then Sr isotope stratigraphy can be used
for correlation. For high resolution stratigraphic
correlation in the Plio-Pleistocene, oxygen isotopes
coarsely calibrated by biostratigraphy can be used.
Direct radiometric dating of sediments is highly
dependent on the presence of unaltered glauconite.
One final cautionary note: any attempt at strati-
graphic correlation using isotopes ignores the effects
of diagenetic alteration at its peril!
8.3 Lithological and reservoir property
correlation
Correlation of lithological and reservoir properties
is usually an appraisal and development problem,
following on from the discovery of a petroleum
Lithostratigraphic correlation
Hydrodynamic correlation based on RFT data
Fig. 8.4 Comparison of lithostratigraphic and pressure correlation in a reservoir from the Northern North Sea, UKCS. The
hydrodynamic correlation is based on reservoir pressure data measured using the RFf (repeat formation tester) tool
(Dake, 1982). The lithostratigraphic correlation is not justified by the pressure data. This does not mean that the
lithostratigraphic scheme is incorrect, but there is no reason to correlate the interval as a continuous reservoir zone. The
lithostratigraphic correlation of the lower stippled zone is supported by pressure data between wells Band C, but not
between wells A and B.

accumulation. Typical correlation problems may
involve predicting the distribution of the main
reservoir sand, predicting the lateral distribution of
horizontal barriers to flow such as mudstone beds or
carbonate-cemented layers, or determining whether
faulting is compartmentalizing an oil or gas field. All
will exert a major influence on the continuity of
petroleum filled intervals and on the behaviour of
the underlying aquifer.
The nature of the problem to be tackled largely
determines the appropriate correlation method.
Although it is preferable to tackle almost any cor-
relation problem within a stratigraphic framework,
if a reservoir is significantly compartmentalized by
faults or if lithologies and facies within a stratigraphic
interval are highly variable or difficult to date, a
stratigraphic correlation will probably be unable to
provide adequate resolution and may be of limited
use. If the correlation problem involves linking
parts of a reservoir with related physical properties
(for example, for input into reservoir simulation
models), engineering data, particularly pressure and
well performance can be used. An example of how
pressure data from several wells may be used to link
up units with a common pressure regime is shown in
Fig. 8.4 (p. 191). Note how the pressure and litho-
stratigraphic correlations do not correspond exactly.
Well performance data may be used to correlate
intervals based on the effect that production at one
well has on neighbouring wells. Taking a hypotheti-
cal example, if production from lithological interval
A in well X causes a pressure drop in lithological
interval B in well Y, it is reasonable to assume
that there is reservoir connectivity between the two
wells, but between different lithological intervals.
This correlative tool is known as interference test-
ing, and provides vital dynamic data for reservoir
modelling. Dynamic data may be supplemented by
static geological correlations using wireline logs
and core, as well as three-dimensional seismic data
obtained using a very fine line spacing of only a
few tens of metres. Finally, to incorporate a fur-
ther element of geological heterogeneity present in
most
reservoirs,
non-deterministic
or stochastic
data may be incorporated into a reservoir model.
Stochastic models help describe unpredictable and
uncorrelatable heterogeneities within a reservoir.
Stochastic data may be obtained from outcrop or
from better-constrained subsurface analogues. The
interplay of deterministic and stochastic data in

exploration: Tertiary of offshore Norway

east-west transects through 11 wells (from Rundberg &
Smalley, 1989).
8.4.2 Geological background
The Tertiary of the North Sea in the study area com-
prises marine clastic sediments deposited as a post-
rift megasequence (sensu Hubbard et al., 1985) over
earlier syn-rift Jurassic and early post-rift Cret-
aceous sediments, within the overall extensional
setting of the North Sea Basin. After the early Oligo-
cene, basin-margin tectonic events resulted in uplift
of Fennoscandia, the generation of significant seis-
micsequence boundaries and the correspondingshed-
ding of large quantities of eroded material into the
basin. These events in the basin history are of partic-
ular interest to the present study because of their
influence on the burial and thermal history of the
underlying Mesozoic reservoir and source intervals.
8.4.3 Approach
The data for the study were obtained from 11 wells
across two east-west transects (Fig. 8.6). The seismic
stratigraphy of the Tertiary units had already been
unravelled by Rundberg (unpublished data) and
the key boundaries identified for dating purposes.
Lithological and palaeo-environmental information
was obtained from the wells, chiefly from drill cut-
tings, and added to the seismic stratigraphic inter-
pretation. Composite sections using all these data
from both transects are illustrated in Fig. 8.7.
Following seismic mapping and lithological and
environmental
interpretation
of
existing
data,
samples for strontium isotope analysis were selected
from seven of the wells at the sample points indicated
on Fig. 8.8. Samples were obtained from well cut-
tings, which were washed and sieved to recover
the 125-250 ~m and> 250 ~m size fractions. The
analyses were carried out on individual hand-picked
fragments of carbonate bivalve debris which were
carefully examined for evidence of diagenetic altera-
tion. One sample of phosphate (a fish tooth) was
also used, along with three samples of glauconite
from well E which were dated by the Rb-Sr method*
(Smalley & Rundberg, 1990).
* Bivalve, fish tooth and glauconite samples were pre-
pared by ion-exchange techniques and analysed by mass-
spectrometer. Following analysis, the 87Sr/86Sr results from
the bivalve and fish tooth samples were normalized to
Holocene marine carbonate (HMC) standard.

8.4.1 Introduction
This example is based on the work of Rundberg and
Smalley (1989). The objective of the work was to
improve the correlation of Tertiary sedimentary
rocks from the North Sea of offshore Norway (Fig.
8.6). The Tertiary units themselves are not of any
interest as potential reservoir targets; rather the
correlation was required to improve the under-
standing of their depositional history so that the
burial
and
thermal
history
of petroleum-prone
rocks at deeper stratigraphic levels could be refined.
The decision to use strontium isotope stratigraphy
rather than conventional biostratigraphy was driven
by the frequent absence of key biostratigraphic
markers in the studied material and the existence
of sparse and in some cases contradictory well bio-

The strontium isotopic ages for the bivalves and
fish tooth were determined by plotting the 20' limits
of uncertainty for each 87Sr/86Sr analysis and reading
off the corresponding dates from the upper and
lower limits of the seawater curve (Fig. 8.2). The
age of the sample is expressed as the median value ±
half the possible age range. The ages determined by
this method range in uncertainty from ±0.5 to 3 Ma;
this compares favourably with the resolution attain-
able by biostratigraphy. Rb-Sr glauconites ages are
calculated from isochrons (Fig. 8.9) and are highly
precise (± 0.6 to 0.2 Ma).
8.4.4 Strontium isotope ages
The Sr isotope ages for samples taken across each
transect are shown in Fig. 8.8. In every well, the
mean ages young up-section (except for two samples
in wells K and H) and broadly confirm the correla-
tion based on seismic stratigraphy. Figure 8.10
shows chronostratigraphies for both transects and
highlights the major hiatuses evidenced from the
isotopic information. The age constraints placed

boundaries allowed
a relationship
between the Tertiary chronostratigraphy and litho-
stratigraphy to be established for the eight units
mapped. MU 1 and MU 2 were deposited during the
Palaeocene, Eocene and earliest Oligocene. The
lithostratigraphic information from the wells in-
dicates that these sediments were deposited in deep
water (during times of high global sea-levels accord-
ing to the eustatic sea-level curves of Haq et al.,
1987). In a landward direction, the coarser-grained,
shallower-water sediments of MU 2 sub-units I and II
are interpreted to have been deposited during basin
margin uplift between 38 and 33 Ma ago (Fig. 8.8).
From the Sr isotopic ages, it is evident that sub-unit
II of the northern transect is the lateral equivalent of
MU 3 in the southern transect. At about 30 Ma, the
isotope ages suggest a major hiatus between sub-
units II and III.
This corresponds to a sudden
change from deep to shallow marine facies, evidence
of truncation below the seismic reflector correspond-
ing to this junction, and a major sea-level fall on the
Haq et al. (1987) curve. All indicate the develop-
ment of a major sequence boundary at this time.
MU 5 is an upward-shallowing succession de-
posited between 29 and 24 Ma ago in the Late
Oligocene. Although eustatic sea-level was rising at
this time, passive-margin uplift and increased con-
tinental erosion gave rise to shallow water condi-
tions which persisted for the remainder of the
basin's
history.

boundary was developed at the top of MU 5 prior to
deposition of MU 6, a widely distributed sand
deposited between 18 and 7.7 Ma ago. In well E,
Rb-Sr dates from glauconites complement the Sr
isotope ages. Where MU 6 is absent, the hiatus
above MU 5 is of much longer duration, with
Pliocene sediments of MU 7 and MU 8 resting
directly on MU 5.
Although few Sr isotope age data are available for
MU 7 and MU 8, the evidence suggests that these
units were deposited rapidly during the last 5 Ma.
The important consequence of this is that some
areas of the basin must have experienced rapid
increases in burial depth to account for the significant
thicknesses of Plio-Pleistocene sediments, especially
across the northern transect (Fig. 8.8). Although it
cannot be dated with any accuracy due to sparse Sr
isotope data, the regionally important Mid-Pliocene
unconformity probably formed about 2Ma ago.
From the lithological evidence, MU 7 and 8 are
sedimentologically immature and probably relate to
rapid erosion of the hinterland during basin margin
uplift.
8.4.5 Conclusions
From a combination of seismic stratigraphy, litho-
logical information and Sr isotopic ages, the chrono-
stratigraphy and correlation of the Tertiary of the
Norwegian North Sea have been much improved. Sr
isotopes assisted in both chronostratigraphic correla-
tion and in the identification of major sequence

interest to this study, comprised shelf and deepwater

Switching of the system has had a profound effect on
the distribution of sediments in the GOM. The
effects of glacio-eustasy have also influenced sedi-
ment supply, with the formation of deeply incised
canyons in the shelf margin and slope which acted as
feeders for deepwater fan sand deposition.
8.5.3 Approach
The data for this study were obtained from the OCS
well G 1267 No. A-I, in the South Timbalier Block
198 (the well name is shortened to 'ST 198' here-
after), towards the south-east of the hydrocarbon
exploration area (Fig. 8.11). The well was drilled in
1962 to a total depth of about 16000 feet, with
drilling cuttings obtained every 30 feet from 3000
feet downwards. Resistivity and self potential (SP)
logs were run in the well to identify hydrocarbon-
bearing sands (Fig. 8.12).
Samples of foraminifera for stable isotope analysis

stone and mudstone drilling cuttings. Two types

the regional tectonic framework and, where appro-
priate, to the eustatic sea-level curves of Haq et al.
(1987). This improved understanding of the deposi-
tional sequences in this part of the North Sea has
helped to constrain the burial and thermal history
of underlying Mesozoic units of significant hydro-
carbon potential.
8.5.1 Introduction
This case study is based on the work of Trainor and
Williams (1990) and the isotope stratigraphy group
at the University of South Carolina, USA. The
objectives were to:
1 establish a high resolution geochronology for Plio-
Pleistocene sediments in the outer continental shelf-
slope of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) using oxygen
isotopes;
2 identify unconformities for stratigraphic correla-
tion; and
3 determine
the
relationship
(if
any)
between
phases of sand input and sea-level falls during glacial
episodes.
Unlike the Plio-Pleistocene of offshore Norway dis-
cussed in the previous study, this portion of the
stratigraphy in the GOM is an active exploration
target, containing sandy reservoirs. Any correlation
tool which can improve stratigraphic correlation and
identify sand-prone portions of the stratigraphy is of
major consequence to the exploration effort.

8.5.2 Geological background
The GOM was formed in the Mid to Late Jurassic
by the breakup of Pangaea and the rifting of North
America away from a joined Northern Africa-
South America. Thick salt was deposited during the
early stages of rifting, followed by the development
of extensive carbonate platforms in the Cretaceous
around a deep basin floored by oceanic crust. Major,
siliciclastic deposition in the GOM began with the
late Cretaceous- Palaeogene uplift and erosion of
the North American Cordillera. Along the northern
margin of the Gulf, siliciclastics were able to build
out past the carbonate platform margins, creating

Fig. 8.13 Oxygen isotope compositions of foraminifera
from well ST 198 (from Trainor & Williams, 1990). Isotope
values on the left were derived from benthic forams, those
on the right from planktonic forams. Numbers from 24 to
131 refer to oxygen isotope stages. The average timespan
occupied by each is about 30000 years.
Uvigerina spp.) were selected for analysis to search
for differences that might exist between the surface
and bottom-water isotopic records. Detailed bio-
stratigraphy was performed on ST 198 to provide a
coarse calibration for the oxygen isotope analyses
and identified a major unconformity at 7320 ft. This
was the only hiatus discernible from biostratigraphic
analysis. In order to identify further unconformities
not resolved biostratigraphically, the oxygen isotope
data were plotted against age using the ages of
isotope stage boundaries proposed by Trainor et al.,
(1988) (Fig. 8.13). They were also plotted against
depth to see whether oxygen isotope ratios could be
related to the occurrence of sands (Fig. 8.12).
8.5.4 Oxygen isotope stratigraphy
Figure 8.13 shows two major hiatuses in the isotope
record which divide the well into three broad sedi-
ment packages, T1, T2 and T3. The youngest, T1,
begins at approximately 0.90 Ma, corresponding to
stage 26/27, and continues until 0.84 Ma, correspond-
ing to (glacial) stage 24. T2 extends from the begin-
ning of stage 48 at 1.41 Ma to the beginning of stage
60 at 1.76 Ma. During this interval, negative 5180
values for both planktonic and bottom-dwelling
foraminifera suggest that glacial
meltwater dis-
charge affected both the surface and bottom waters.
Interval T3 begins at the 104/105 isotope stage
boundary and ends at glacial stage 132, approx-
imately 3.92Ma. The oxygen isotope stratigraphy
provides better chronostratigraphic resolution than
did biostratigraphy and identifies two major un-
conformities. Burial histories constructed using the
two dating schemes are shown in Fig. 8.14. The
unconformities can be tied to seismic lines at the
well and extrapolated as sequence boundaries.
Positive seawater oxygen isotopic ratios reflect
low sea-levels during glacial times when the lighter
160 isotope is preferentially concentrated in the ice-
sheet. Negative oxygen isotopic compositions reflect
times of higher sea-levels when the ice sheets melt.
From Fig. 8.12, it is evident that much of the sand

8.6.1 Introduction
The Ekofisk Field is the largest of several petro-
leum accumulations in the Cretaceous and earliest
Tertiary (Danian) Chalks of the North Sea, of which
most are in the Norwegian and Danish sectors (Fig.
8.15). The Chalk reservoirs are complex; reservoir
units are mainly redeposited and fractured chalk,
while marine hardgrounds (Kennedy & Garrison,
1975) form laterally extensive permeability barriers,
which may compartmentalize reservoirs and give
rise to different reservoir fluid chemistries above
and below.
The objective of this study, from work by Smalley
et al. (1992), was to demonstrate how strontium
isotope analyses of fluid and rock samples could be
used to determine the lateral extent and effective-
ness of a cemented layer in the Ekofisk Field. The
study also demonstrates how strontium isotope
analyses of reservoir fluids can indicate the presence
and origin of variable water salinities. This has
implications for determining water (Sw) and oil (So)
saturations.

deposited
during sea-level
lowstands,
and,
to a lesser extent, during early transgressions as
would be predicted by clastic sequence stratigraphy
(Posamentier & Vail, 1988).
8.5.5 Conclusions
The main objectives of this work were to establish a
high
resolution
stratigraphy for
Plio-Pleistocene
sediments of well ST 198 in the Gulf of Mexico, to
identify unconformities for stratigraphic correlation
in the area and to relate the sea-level changes (via
the oxygen isotope curve) to periods of major sand
input to the basin. By any standards, the study
was pretty successful. Oxygen isotope stratigraphy
of selected
foraminiferal
species
satisfied
most
of these
objectives.
Two major
unconformities
were identified which could be tied to seismic for
stratigraphic correlation away from wells, and much
of the sand recorded in the well was deposited dur-
ing times of sea-level lowstand or early transgression
as predicted by clastic sequence stratigraphy.
8.6.2 Geological background
The Ekofisk Field is situated in the southern part of
the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea (Figs 1.1 &
8.15). The Ekofisk structure was domed upwards by
movement of underlying Permian Salt; the north-
west flank of the field is faulted, but otherwise the
structure is relatively simple. The stratigraphy of
the field is shown in Fig. 8.16. Oil is reservoired in
the Danian Ekofisk Formation and the Turonian
to Maastrichtian Tor Formation. Both are com-
posed largely of chalk debris flows, with individual
flows reaching up to 10 m in thickness. The debris
flows are interpreted to have been initiated by
synsedimentary tectonism, probably related to salt
diapirism and/or associated faulting. Below the Tor
Formation lie the water-bearing Hod Formation and
the Plenus Marl.
Major diagenesis of the Ekofisk chalks began in
the marine environment, with extensive hardground
formation at several levels throughout the field.
The most significant is the 'Ekofisk Tight Zone',
straddling the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, an
autochthonous chalk which was heavily cemented
and bored during exposure on the sea-floor (Fig.

8.16). The Tight Zone has very low permeability,
and production data indicate that it is a barrier to
vertical fluid movement across parts of the field.
Later diagenesis involved extensive calcite cementa-
tion, as well as fracturing. The fracturing of the
chalk has resulted in permeabilities of up to 150 mD,
even though permeability in the coccolith-dominated
and calcite-cemented chalk matrix may be almost
two orders of magnitude lower. Although some of
the fractures have been infilled by later calcite,
open fracture networks remain the most productive
intervals in the Ekofisk Field and other Chalk fields
in the North Sea.
8.6.3 Approach
Two wells were sampled for this study, 2/4-A8
and 2/4-C8 (Fig. 8.15). Well A8 is situated on the
southern flank of the Ekofisk structure, separated by
a few kilometres from crestal well e8. Twenty-one
samples of chalk matrix were collected from core$.
For each sample, a few grams of rock were removed

from -3.3 to -5.7%0 (Fig. 8.17). This range is too
great to be accounted for solely by the variation
of primary marine carbonate and is interpreted to
represent a combination of primary carbonate and
diagenetic cement, with the cements contribut-
ing lighter oxygen. Degree of cementation can be

and fairly constant, showing no depth-related trend.
The small non-carbonate contribution of radiogenic
Sr has either been derived locally, from silicate
minerals within the chalk, or externally derived Sr
has had time to homogenize throughout the forma-
tion. In the Tor Formation, the downward increase
in 87Sr/86Sr does not correlate with the amount of
silicate minerals. The most likely explanation is that
the porewaters have been influenced by a flux of Sr
with 87Sr/86Sr > 0.710 from beneath. Irrespective of
our lack of a full understanding of the source of the
radiogenic Sr, the strontium isotopes clearly indicate
that there is still a significant difference between the
compositions of porewaters in the Ekofisk and Tor
formations; the Ekofisk Tight Zone barrier is still
effective today. This is corroborated by seismic data
which indicate that the Tight Zone is continuous
between the two study wells, and by pressure data
which indicate significant pressure differences above
and below the Tight Zone in some parts of the field.
The porewater strontium isotopic compositions
can also be used as a tool for determining formation
water salinities. Waters produced from the Ekofisk
Formation and upper part of the Tor Formation
have Sr isotopic ratios similar to those determined
indirectly by residual salt analysis, and have total
salinities of 50000-85000 mg.l- 1. The deeper part
of the Tor Formation is characterized by more
radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions and higher
formation
water
total
salinities,
ranging
from
80000-140000 mg.l- 1. It thus seems possible that
the increase in 87Sr/86Sr with depth could be accom-
panied by a progressive increase in formation water
estimated from porosity as those samples with lower
porosity contain more cement. The relationship
between 0180 and porosity (Fig. 8.18) allows the
oxygen isotopic composition of the cements to
be calculated. Assuming that the cements were
precipitated from marine waters of Cretaceous to
Palaeocene age (with a composition of about -1%0
SMOW), the approximate temperature of burial
cement precipitation in the chalks ranges from about
90 to 160°C, suggesting that the cementation is a
relatively high temperature phenomenon.
The carbon isotopic compositions of the samples
are somewhat less variable than the oxygen isotope
compositions, ranging from 1.3 to 3.0%0 PDB. These
values fall within the range expected for unaltered
marine chalks and show that no external carbon
source has been involved in cementation.
Strontium isotope analyses of the Ekofisk Forma-
tion fall very close to what would be expected of
unaltered chalks (Fig. 8.19), again suggesting that
the strontium in the cements was derived from
sedimentary chalk. In the Tor Formation, however,
strontium isotope ratios are very different showing a
much greater range of compositions and, in both
wells, a steady increase in 87Sr/86Sr with depth. This
probably represents a source of relatively radiogenic
Sr that contributed a greater proportion of the Sr in
the deeper cements.
In summary, the chalks of the Ekofisk Field com-
prise a mixture of primary calcite and calcite cement
precipitated at relatively high temperatures during
burial. In the Ekofisk Formation the cement was
derived almost entirely from remobilized depos-
itional calcite, whereas in the Tor Formation it was
derived from a mixture of internally derived calcite
and carbonate and strontium from elsewhere. The
separate diagenetic evolution of the Ekofisk and the
Tor formations suggests that the Ekofisk Tight Zone
which separates them was acting as a barrier during
diagenesis. Can strontium isotope analyses of the
porewater salts confirm whether this barrier is still
effective today, during oil production?
Strontium isotopic analyses of residual salts vary
systematically with depth both within and between
wells, correlating strongly with the strontium isotopic
values measured in the chalk samples. 87Sr/86Sr
nonetheless increases more rapidly with depth in
the water than in the chalk (Fig. 8.19). The most
plausible explanation for this difference is that pore-
water compositions are partially buffered by the
enclosing chalk. In the Ekofisk Formation, the dif-
ference between chalk and porewater ratios is small

evaporites. The implications of any salinity gradient
could be considerable as estimates of oil-in-place
would be affected*.
8.6.5 Conclusions
The use of strontium isotopes on chalk and pore-
water salts in the Ekofisk Field demonstrated the
long-lived effectiveness of the Ekofisk Tight Zone as
a barrier between the Ekofisk and Tor formations,
* Oil saturation (So) is calculated by determining the
water saturation (5w ), which is in turn estimated from the
resistivity of the formation water, usually assuming a single
formation water resistivity valu~. Resistivity is controlled
largely by salinity, so if salinity variations do exist in the
reservoir, this could have a significant impact on estimates
of oil reserves calculations.
from the time of chalk burial diagenesis to the
present day. The Tight Zone effectively divides the
field into two across much of its extent. This con-
clusion is independently confirmed by seismic and
pressure data. Isotopic analyses of porewater salts
have also suggested that a salinity gradient may exist
in the Tor Formation, controlled by diffusion of
material
from
underlying
Zechstein
evaporites.
This salinity gradient may impact upon oil reserve
calculations for Ekofisk.

include

(UKCS; Figs 1.1 & 8.20). In Gullfaks and Statfjord,
significant quantities of petroleum are also contained
within Lower Jurassic Cook Formation sandstones
and uppermost Triassic (Rhaetian) to Pliensbachian
Statfjord Formation sandstones.
Correlation of these reservoir sandstones across
the large structural closures (many tens to a few
hundred square kilometres) of these fields is often
difficult, particularly as intrafield faulting has com-
partmentalized many of the structures and because
the reservoir sandstone units (apart from the Cook
Formation) are dominantly non-marine or marginal
marine with few biostratigraphically useful taxa.

between the Gullfaks and Snorre fields, some 20 km

8.7.2 Geological background
The Gullfaks Field is situated in Norwegian waters
on the Tampen Spur structure of the northern
Viking Graben of the Northern North Sea (Fig.
8.20).
This
structurally
complex
field
contains
approximately 200 Mbbl of oil
in Triassic and
Jurassic reservoir sandstones at approximately 2km
burial depth. Only 9% of Gullfaks oil is contained in
the oldest reservoir unit, the Statfjord Formation
which consists of interbedded sandstones, siltstones
and shales interpreted to represent alluvial flood-
plain and braided stream environments (Fig. 8.21).
The Cook Formation of the Dunlin Group contains
only 6% of the oil, in marine sandstones deposited
following a major transgression over the terrestrial
Statfjord sediments. The precise environment of
deposition of the Cook sandstones is not well con-
strained;
interpretations
range
from
turbidites
through distal deltaic sands to tidal sand bars.
The majority of the oil in Gullfaks (85%) is con-
tained in Aalenian to Bathonian Brent Group sand-
stones. The Brent Group has been further divided
into five formations (Fig. 8.21; Graue et al., 1987).
The oldest Brent Formation, the Broom, is a poorly
sorted, shallow marine conglomeratic sandstone,
showing an overall thinning from west to east across
the field, interpreted as evidence of syndepositional
faulting and/or a westerly source area for the Broom
sediments. Importantly, the Broom Formation is
not believed to be genetically linked to the overlying
four Brent formations, but to represent sediment
sourced from a different provenance area. The
Rannoch Formation consists of micaceous siltstones
and fine sandstones, with some cross-stratification,
and is interpreted to represent deposition at a wave-
influenced delta front. The Etive Formation com-
prises
low-angle
laminated
and
cross-stratified
medium- to coarse-grained sandstones, interpreted
respectively as upper shoreface and as mouth bar

tion consists of shales, coals, siltstones and sand-
stones, deposited in a delta-plain environment.
Fluvial channel, overbank, interdistributary bay and
lagoonal subenvironments can be recognized. The
youngest Tarbert Formation consists of marine
sandstones, siltstones and shales and represents an
overall transgressive phase, following northward
deltaic progradation into the area.
8.7.3 Approach
Ninety-three samples of sandstones, siltstones and
shales weighing between 100 and 300 gwere obtained
from four wells in different fault segments of the
field, 34/10-1, 34/10-7, 34/10-8 and 34/10-13 (Fig.
8.20). The Statfjord Formation was sampled in well
-13 only, whereas the Cook Formation was sampled
in wells -1, -7 and -13, and the Brent Formation in
wells -1 and -8. The samples were crushed and Sm
and Nd isotope ratios analysed by standard tech-
niques (Mearns,
1986). Analytical errors in the
147Sm/144Nd ratio are estimated to be ± 0.25%,
which computes through to provenance age as an
error of ± 20 Ma.
8.7.4 Sm-Nd isotopic correlation
Figure 8.22 shows Nd concentrations, 147Sm/144Nd,
143Nd/144Nd ratios and provenance ages plotted
against depth for all the sampled wells. Most of the
samples had Nd concentrations that ranged from 0
to 60 ppm,
apparently independent of lithology
and stratigraphy and therefore not of much use for
correlation. Similarly, the 147Sm/144Nd ratio of the
samples ranged from 0.10 to 0.12 and could not be
used to discriminate lithology (although there was a
general stratigraphic trend with lower mean and
median 147Sm/144Nd ratios in Statfjord samples than
in Dunlin and Brent Group units). Because of the
general uniformity of 147Sm/144Nd ratios in most of
the samples, the main control on provenance age is
the 143Nd/144Nd ratio. The provenance age para-
meter was, however, preferred to the 143Nd/144Nd

dimensionless isotopic ratio.
Correlation ofsediments with source areas
The general trend of provenance ages in Gullfaks is
from oldest at the bottom of the section (in the
Statfjord Formation) to youngest in the Brent
Group. This trend is believed to reflect changes
in sediment source areas and thus to provide infor-
mation about changes in provenance and palaeo-
geography with time. The majority of samples from
the Statfjord Formation have provenance ages
between 1850 and 2400 Ma, with a few samples as
young as 1450 Ma. These results suggest a source
area considerably older than most of those in
Scotland or Norway, possibly the Archean shield to

210 Chapter 8
the north-west of Scotland. The range in provenance
ages is believed to reflect a mixing of sediment types
derived from the ancient Archean source, and a
younger, more proximal source, possibly on the
Shetland Platform.
The majority of samples from the Dunlin and
Brent groups have provenance ages between 1350
and 1850 Ma which does not conclusively identify
sediment provenance. However, some samples from
the Ness and Tarbert formations have provenance
ages of less than 1350 Ma, suggesting a source area
younger than those in Scotland or Norway, possibly
reflecting a sediment component from the Forties
volcanic centre of the Central North Sea.

Correlation within the Gullfaks Field
On a field scale, the probability of time-equivalent
strata yielding similar provenance ages is reasonably
high, as the likelihood of several different sediment
dispersal systems being involved in deposition at
closely spaced localities is relatively small. This con-
tention has been borne out by duplicate analyses of
sediment samples collected from several hundred
metres apart in modern Norwegian river systems
which

using provenance ages. The provenance age patterns
above the N2a zone are rather different, suggesting
that the relatively uniform sediment deposition seen
lower in the section has been replaced by more
periodic, localized deposition with differential sub-
sidence. Alternatively, these sediments may not be
contemporaneous.
Correlation between the Gullfaks and Snorre fields
The correlation potential of sediment provenance
ages between fields a few tens of kilometres apart is
likely to be more limited than intrafield correlation
because of the increased probability of different
sediment dispersal systems actively depositing sedi-
ment at more widely spaced localities. The results

8.7.5 Conclusions
Sm-Nd provenance age determinations have poten-
tial applications at several stages during exploration,
field appraisal and development. Correlation of
reservoir sediments with provenance areas may be
used to map out the influence of different sediment
dispersal systems on a regional scale and assist in the
production of palaeogeographic and sand distribu-
tion maps at an early stage of exploration. At a
more mature stage of exploration, comparison of
interfield provenance ages can provide information
about the likely continuity of sediment dispersal
systems on an intermediate scale. On an intrafield
scale, particularly where sediments are poor in bio-
stratigraphically diagnostic forms and/or where the
field is structurally complex, Sm-Nd provenance
studies can assist in identifying sandbodies deposited
by the same sediment dispersal system.
relation is highly equivocal, it may represent depos-
ition of sediments in this portion of the section by
the same dispersal system. The upper section of both
wells is, however, rather different, although the
general trend upwards towards decreasing prov-
enance ages appears to be consistent. The difficulty
in correlating the upper section may reflect the onset
of Jurassic rifting and the development of a tectonic
control on sediment dispersal patterns.

9.1 Introduction
The petroleum in an oil or gas reservoir will never
be completely recovered. A fraction will always
remain in the reservoir for a number of reasons. For
example, the reservoir may have insufficient energy
of its own to expel the petroleum, capillary forces
will prevent oil movement, the oil may be too
viscous to move under reservoir conditions or some
may be contained in blind pores which are not
linked up to the overall reservoir porosity system
(though this would beg the question of how petro-
leum might have entered in the first place). An ideal
recovery mechanism would optimize the rate of
petroleum production (and with it cash flow and the
return on investment) and maximize the proportion
of petroleum that will be eventually recovered. In
practice, there tends to be a trade off between the
two objectives: the recovery scheme that gets the oil
out of the ground fastest (usually preferred by oil
companies) frequently leaves a large proportion of it
behind (usually not liked by governments). A con-
sequence of improvements in recovery methods is
that the recoverable reserves of fields tend to be
occasionally revised upwards (which is good for
share prices and cheaper than exploration). A 2%
reserves growth in a 10 billion barrel oilfield, for
example, could be worth hundreds of millions of
pounds.
Petroleum recovery mechanisms are divided into
three broad categories (Fig. 9.1).
1 Primary recovery, in which the inherent energy
of the reservoir or adjacent aquifer provides the
necessary drive for petroleum production. Primary
recovery mechanisms include gas cap drive, solution
gas drive,
compaction drive and
aquifer drive
(Dake, 1978).
2 Secondary recovery, in which additional energy
is introduced into the reservoir-aquifer system
to accelerate production and increase ultimate
recovery. Secondary recovery mechanisms include
seawater and gas injection.
3 Tertiary recovery, more commonly referred to as
enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which involves chang-
ing the physical and chemical properties of the

of an oilfield. Many (though far
from all) reservoirs are initially left
to produce without interference

employed a few years after the start
of production in order to prolong

Tertiary recovery (EOR) methods
are often used later on to retard the

reservoir. EOR methods include the introduction
of heat through fireflooding or steam-flooding to
reduce the viscosity of heavy oils and improve their
mobility (LatH, 1980) and the addition of chem-
icals such as surfactants and CO2 to improve oil
permeability.
Inorganic geochemistry can make contributions to
the design of all three types of recovery processes.
Its contribution to primary recovery is largely to
early prediction of reservoir quality and as such has
been covered in Chapter 6. In this chapter, we will
review secondary and EOR mechanisms and the
contribution
which
inorganic
geochemistry
can
make in describing the reservoir prior to initiating a
recovery programme and in monitoring its progress.
Part of this monitoring process is the prediction
of the nature and quantities of corrosive fluids.
The main corrosive fluids affecting oil and gas
fields are H 2S, known as sour gas, and CO2, H2S
is corrosive to most materials used in petroleum
production and is highly toxic. CO2 is also highly
corrosive. These gases may be natural reservoir
fluids or may be generated as an unwelcome by-
product of the petroleum recovery process itself. It
is important to know which. Inorganic geochemistry
can assist in identifying the origin of the fluid, likely
quantities to be produced and reservoir intervals
which are
particularly prone
to corrosive
fluid
production.
9.2 Secondary recovery
The
two
main
secondary
recovery
mechanisms
are water injection and gas injection. These will
normally augment the natural aquifer or gas cap
drive of the reservoir. The main objectives of both
these recovery mechanisms are to maintain the
pressure of the reservoir by replacing produced oil
with injected water or gas (voidage replacement) and
to improve the reservoir sweep*, as the injected
fluid contacts portions of unproduced oil.
The key factors in assessing the suitability of a
reservoir for secondary recovery are a knowledge
of the connectivity of the reservoir and of any
deterioration of reservoir quality across the field.
The latter is especially important for water injection
as the aquifers of many reservoirs commonly have
poorer reservoir quality than the petroleum-bearing
portions. In the Magnus Field, for example, the
presence of abundant quartz cement and fibrous
illite in the aquifer renders permeabilities so low
that water could not be injected into the aquifer
(Heaviside et al., 1983). Water was in fact injected
directly into the oil zone, which was necessary but
which involved a loss of oil reserves. The contribu-
* Reservoir sweep refers to the proportion of unproduced
oil which is contacted by injected seawater and pushed
towards the production well. A high sweep efficiency
means that the waterflood front has contacted a high
proportion of the oil.

tion of inorganic geochemistry to aquifer perme-
ability problems is in describing and predicting the
diagenesis of the aquifer and its effect on reservoir
quality (see also Chapter 6).
Once a secondary recovery scheme such as sea-
water injection has been initiated, monitoring the
progress of the injected water is necessary to ensure
that breakthrough of water into the production wells
does not occur unexpectedly. During oil production,
reservoir formation water is usually produced along
with petroleum. As a water injection scheme pro-
ceeds, the produced water may comprise both the
natural formation water and the injected water. The
greater the quantity of injected water produced, the
closer the water front is to the production well.
There are several ways of monitoring the progress of
injected water: production log analysis*, analysis
of ionic species from produced fluids and tracer
studies. The main cation used to detect seawater
incursion is sulphate, normally present in much
greater concentrations in seawater (approximately
2650 ppm) than in formation waters (usually a few
to a few tens of parts per million). One of the
difficulties
in
using
sulphate
concentrations
to
monitor breakthrough is that barium or strontium,
often present in considerable amounts in formation
waters, may remove sulphate from the injected sea-
water through the precipitation of barite or celestite
in the reservoir. As well as causing formation damage
(porosity and permeability reduction), the lowered
concentrations of sulphate recorded from produced
fluids will give rise to underestimation of the propor-
tion of injection water in the petroleum-water mix-
ture produced. Sulphate may also be removed from
seawater by ion-exchange reactions in the forma-
tion. Tracers can overcome the problem of reaction
in the reservoir. These include chemicals such as
iodides, nitrates and alcohols and radioactive sub-
stances such as tritiated water (water with added 3H)
and solutions or complexes of radioactive isotopes
of carbon, sodium, nickel and iodine. The injected
seawater is normally spiked with a tracer at the
injection well; if recovered at the production well,
injected water has broken through. There are some
obvious problems with tracers. They are expensive
to buy and toxic or radioactive substances should
not in general be tipped over the side of the rig so
must be carefully disposed of (Smalley et al., 1988).
* Production logs include a range of tools which monitor
the flow rate and saturation of hydrocarbons during field
production.
Petroleum Recovery 215
A further limitation common to all tracer methods is
that they yield no information at all until they are
first detected in production wells which may be
months or even years after injection.
The difficulties associated with tracer methods
and with reactions of natural ionic species in the
reservoir can be overcome to an extent by using
natural isotopic tracers present both in the reservoir
formation waters and in injected seawater. These
include the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composi-
tions of the waters themselves and their strontium
isotopic compositions and strontium concentrations.
Several important criteria need to be fulfilled before
natural isotopic tracers can be used, the most obvious
of which is that injection and formation waters must
be isotopically distinct. The first case study that we
will look at in this chapter - from the Forties Field
illustrates how oxygen and hydrogen isotopes may
be used to monitor produced waters and detect and
quantify seawater breakthrough.
A further pre-
requisite for the use of strontium isotopic tracers is
that the strontium concentrations of injected and
formation waters need to be similar; otherwise, the
isotopic signature of the water with high Sr con-
centration will swamp that of the other, no matter
how distinct their isotopic compositions are (Smalley
etal., 1988).
9.3 Enhanced oil recovery
An EOR project will usually be initiated at some
stage during secondary recovery as part of a phased
recovery programme (Fig. 9.1). Some oilfields will
even use EOR techniques from the start of produc-
tion; many western Canadian heavy oilfields, for
example, can only be produced by reducing the oil
viscosity by in situ combustion or steamflooding
(Outtrim & Evans, 1977).
The nine main EOR processes are listed in Table
9.1. In this chapter, we will deal mainly with thermal
processes which alter the physical properties of the
rock as well as that of the petroleum: in situ combus-
tion and steamflooding. Before initiating any of
these recovery processes, it is necessary to know
the field's remaining oil-in-place and its distribution
and to have a good geological description of the
reservoir including connectivity, pore systems and
mineralogies
(especially
clays)
surrounding
the
pores (Ebanks, 1987). Connectivity may already be
quite well known if the EOR process forms part of a
phased recovery programme. However, if produc-
tion involves EOR at the start, only static reservoir

chapter. Depths, lithologies, oil gravities and permeabilities refer to the optimum reservoir properties for the recovery
process. The processes marked with an asterisk are miscible displacement processes, in which the injected fluid mixes with
the oil to form a mobile mixture which can then be displaced by secondary recovery techniques such as wateror gas
injection.

descriptors will be available, such as core/log infor-
mation and pressure. These data can potentially be
supplemented
by strontium
isotope
analyses of
porewater salts, which may provide information on
reservoir connectivity (Section 8.6). A description
of the pore-scale heterogeneity of the reservoir is
also essential before initiating an EOR programme.
Information on pore types and origin can be obtained
from transmitted light microscopic observation of
thin-sections and SEM (Chapter 2). Core analytical
techniques (which conventionally include porosity,
permeability
and
grain
density
measurements),
combined with PIA, can provide information on the
size distribution and shape of pores and on how they
influence reservoir quality. Petrography can also
provide information on the minerals that line pore
systems. Clay mineral types and distributions are of
particular importance as they can exhibit both a
detrimental and enhancing effect on EOR pro-
cesses. Abundant swelling clays such as smectites
will expand and block pore throats during steam-
flooding. By contrast, clay minerals may actually
promote in situ combustion by promoting the de-
position of small quantities of carbon ('coke') ahead
of the fire front (Neasham, 1977). Clay mineral
characterization and quantification can be achieved
by TEM, XRD and TG-EWA.
The last two case histories in this chapter describe
the effects of steam injection and fireflooding on the
mineralogies and reservoir properties of heavy oil
reservoirs in Alberta, Canada.
9.4 Production of corrosive fluids
Corrosive
fluid
production
during
petroleum
recovery is hazardous to both production facilities
and
health.
The principal corrosive fluids
pro-
duced during petroleum recovery are H2S and CO2 ,
both of which may form a proportion of the in situ
reservoir fluids, and/or be generated as part of the
production process.
H 2S can originate in three main ways. Firstly,
it may be generated as a product of source rock
maturation and be transported to the reservoir with
the migrating petroleum. Marine carbonate source
rocks are particularly prone to H2S generation,
owing to kerogen precursors with a high sulphide
content. Secondly, sour gas may be generated by in
situ
reservoir reactions,
particularly at elevated
temperatures.
For
example,

sulphur-
rich
oils
reservoired
in

Jurassic
Smackover carbonates of the Gulf of Mexico have
been thermally cracked to pyrobitumen, CH4 and
H2S (Sassen, 1988). H2S may also be generated

by inorganic-organic reactions in reservoirs.
In
sulphate-bearing reservoirs such as the Permian
Khuff Formation of Abu Dhabi, the reaction of
anhydrite with CH4 in the reservoir at high temperat-
ures has produced H2S and calcite. Finally, H2S
may be generated during petroleum production. It
may be produced by the reduction of sulphate con-
tained in seawater when injected into the reservoir,
or it may originate by reactions within the reservoir
formation fluids during production. The case study
on the Bridport Sands reservoir of the Wytch Farm
Oilfield outlines the problems of understanding the
production of sour gas during petroleum recovery.
CO2 is a common reservoir fluid in gas fields. The
giant
Natuna
D-Alpha
Gas
Field
of
offshore
Indonesia contains up to 100 tcf of CO2 , forming
in excess of 70% of the total gas (Rudolph &
Lehmann, 1989). This CO2 was certainly derived
from
outside
the
reservoir,
either
by
thermal
decarboxylation in the source rock, or from an
igneous source. CO2 can be produced in a reservoir
by reaction of carbonate with organic acids gener-
ated from organic matter in source rocks just prior
to petroleum expulsion (though this process may be
of minor importance). Hutcheon et al. (1980) have
shown that CO2 can potentially be produced by
reaction of carbonates with clay minerals at high
reservoir temperatures. CO2 can also be generated
during petroleum recovery. The main sources of
carbon in most reservoirs are the hydrocarbons
themselves
and
inorganic carbonate grains
and
cements. The case study on enhanced recovery of

9.5 Secondary recovery: Forties Field,
offshore UK
9.5.1 Introduction
Forties is one of the largest oilfields in the North
Sea, with an original oil-in-place of 4340 Mbbl, and
original reserves estimated at 2480 Mbbl (Figs 1.1 &
6.47). The field was discovered in 1970 and started
production in 1975 by a natural aquifer drive mech-
anism with seawater injection support. It currently
supports five production platforms (Fig. 9.2), with
103 wells-81 producers and 22 injectors-producing
at 165000 stock tank barrels of oil per day. The
objective of this study was to investigate whether
oxygen and hydrogen isotopes could be used to
determine the proportions of formation water and
injected seawater appearing in production wells in
the field.
9.5.2 Geological background
The setting of the Forties Field is described in
Section
6.7.2.
The
medium-grained
subarkosic
sandstones in the reservoir are generally poorly
cemented, with limited amounts of kaolinite and
quartz cement. Carbonate nodules and layers are
also present, with the latter sometimes providing

Samples of produced Forties formation water which
had apparently not suffered seawater breakthrough
(according to their sulphate concentrations) were
obtained from 10 wells; five producers from the
Main Sand and five from the Charlie Sand. Five
wells which were believed to be cutting seawater
were
also
sampled.
The
sampled
waters
were
analysed for their ionic constituents and for oxygen
and hydrogen isotopic compositions (Table 9.2).

permeabilities of several hundred millidarcies.
Two main sandstone bodies have been identified
in Forties, the Main Sand and the overlying Charlie
Sand, separated by an extensive shale barrier, the
Charlie Shale (Fig. 9.3). The Main Sand comprises a
series of broadly sheet-like high density turbidites
with a net to gross of 75-85%. The overlying
Charlie Sand is less sandy, with a net to gross of
65-80%, and is interpreted as a submarine channel
system.

Hydrogen
isotopic compositions show
proportionately less
variation, but are distinctly different from the sea-
water hydrogen isotopic composition. This means
that &0 (rather than &180) is likely to be the most
sensitive indicator of seawater breakthrough. An
unexpected result of the isotopic analyses of the pre-
breakthrough waters was the separation of Main and
Charlie Sand waters into two distinct populations,
suggesting
separate
origins
and/or evolutionary
pathways for the Main and Charlie Sand waters.
These isotopic differences also mean that for cal-
culating the extent of seawater breakthrough it is
essential to know whether production is from the
Main or Charlie Sand.
Calculation of the extent of seawater break-
through assumes a simple two-component mixture
of seawater and formation water. The percentage
breakthrough of seawater is calculated by applying a
simple lever rule principle to both seawater-Main
Sand water and seawater-Charlie Sand water mix-
tures (Fig. 9.5). The main uncertainty associated
with the calculation of breakthrough is the isotopic
composition of uncontaminated formation water.
Figure 9.4 shows the uncertainty range of Main and
Charlie Sand water isotopic compositions. Using the
simple two-component mixture, the extent of sea-
water breakthrough in the Main Sand from well
FA52 is 23.4 ± 3.0% (Table 9.3). In the Charlie
Sand, breakthrough in the study wells FC22 and
FC23 is evident, but the most extensive seawater
contamination is recorded from well FC41 which
over a period of 11 months increased its production
of seawater as a percentage of total water produced
from approximately 43 to 85%.
Estimates
of
breakthrough
using
both
ionic
and isotopic methods are compared in Table 9.3.
Sulphate concentrations tend to underestimate the
extent of seawater breakthrough by comparison
with the isotopic method, probably due to in-
reservoir reaction of sulphate and ion exchange.

9.5.5 Conclusions
In the Forties Field, hydrogen and oxygen isotopic
analyses of produced waters provide
a
robust
method for determining the extent of seawater
breakthrough during seawater injection. The sens-
itivity of the method is considerably greater than
that provided by analysis of sulphate ion concentra-
tions,
but
isotopically
well-characterized
pre-
breakthrough formation waters are required for
successful application of the method. The study also
turned up an interesting additional result: that the
Main and Charlie Sands contained water of different
isotopic compositions and hence of probable differ-
ing origins or with different histories.
9.6 Secondary recovery and gas souring:
Wytch Farm Oilfield, Dorset, UK
9.6.1 Introduction
During oil production from the Jurassic Bridport
Sands, one of the two reservoirs of the Wytch Farm
Oilfield in Dorset, spatially and temporally variable
amounts of corrosive HzS were produced from wells
sampled over the period 1984-85. The origin of the
HzS was not known: it was unlikely to have been
derived in significant quantities from Liassic mud-
stones, the petroleum source rock for the Wytch
Farm Field (which would have generated relatively
low sulphur crude) or to have formed in the reservoir
by reaction of CH4 with sulphate minerals as these
are very rare in the Bridport Sands. The objective of
this study was to distinguish between two plausible
origins for the produced HzS:
1 reaction of formation water with seawater which

9.6.2 Geological background
The Wytch Farm Field, discovered in 1973-74, is
the largest onshore oilfield in Western Europe with
original reserves in excess of 280 Mbbl (Figs 1.1 &
9.6). The field comprises several reservoir intervals
(Fig. 9.7). The main reservoir unit is the Sherwood
Sandstone, a Triassic alluvial-braided stream deposit
approximately 150 m thick, which contains 85% of
the petroleum (Dranfield et al., 1987). The Bridport
Sands, Toarcian shallow marine sandstones, contain
up to 9% of the reserves. Less significant produc-
tion is also obtained from a relatively thin Middle
Jurassic limestone.
The Bridport Sands comprise bioturbated, mod-
erately to well sorted fine-grained sandstones and
siltstones, with few visible sedimentary structures.
The sands are interpreted to have been deposited in
a storm-dominated shallow marine environment,
and glauconite and shell debris are common. Where
the Bridport Sands outcrop along the Dorset coast,
spectacular extensive layers of calcite-cemented fine
sandstones can be seen, alternating with poorly
cemented friable siltstones on a decimetre scale.
Other diagenetic components are of relatively minor
volumetric importance, but include kaolinite and
quartz cement. The oil in the Bridport, Sherwood
and the other minor reservoir units in the Wytch
Farm Field was sourced from Liassic mudstones
which are downthrown against the field's main
bounding fault to the south (Fig. 9.6). These are
known, from geochemical analysis, to have gener-
ated allow sulphur crude.
9.6.3 Approach
The approach used here was to characterize the
chemistry of the fluids in the reservoir. Samples of
produced liquids from the Bridport reservoir were
obtained from four wells: B3, B8, D4 and D9 (Fig.
9.6) on three occasions between 1984 and 1985. Two
samples of injected seawater were also obtained.

commonly observed feature of formation waters and
is attributed to oxygen isotope exchange between
the water and isotopically heavier carbonate and
silicate minerals (see Section 4.3.1 and Clayton et
al.. 1966).
There are three produced water isotope analyses,
all from well 09, which do not fall within the forma-
tion water range described above. Both oxygen and
hydrogen
isotopes show
heavier
values,
trend-
ing towards those of injected seawater (Fig. 9.8),
suggesting breakthrough of seawater into well D9.
However, when the Na and Cl concentrations of the
09 waters are plotted against their isotopic composi-
tions (Fig. 9.9), they fall outside a simple seawater-
formation water mixing trend, suggesting that a
third component is contributing to their composi-
tion. This third component is interpreted to be
recent surficial groundwaters, as the 09 data trend
towards 80 and 8180 values of present-day southern
England meteoric water. From the interpretation of
these three components present in the produced
waters of 09, the amount of water breakthrough
in the well can be calculated using the lever rule
principle (Fig. 9.9). The two end-member com-
ponents in this case were assumed to be a mixture of
85% seawater and 15% entrained modern ground-
water injected into the Bridport reservoir and a
formation water of average isotopic and chemical
composition. From this calculation, it is possible to
demonstrate that seawater + modern groundwater
in the produced waters of well D9 has increased
from approximately 34% in 1984 to 52% in 1985.
Armed with this information, it is now possible to
assess the affect of breakthrough on generation of

H2S. Table 9.5 lists the sulphur isotope ratios and
sulphur species concentrations of produced fluids
from the four wells. Unsurprisingly, the highest
concentrations of sulphate are measured in the D9
well where seawater breakthrough has occurred.
However, the concentration of H2S measured in D9
is not as high as that in B3 or B8. It thus appears that '
the sulphur for the H2S is not simply supplied by
seawater. The heavy sulphate 034S values recorded
in all the Bridport Sands formation waters are
incompatible with either present-day or Jurassic
seawater sulphate and
are interpreted to
have
resulted from reduction of sol- to H2S. (Note that
the samples from D9 fall very close to the seawater
sulphate isotope values
reflecting
the
seawater
breakthrough.) In a closed system, sulphate reduc-
tion enriches the H2S in 32S leaving residual sulphate
enriched in 34S. Excluding the D9 data, the correla-
tion between 034S for the sulphate and sulphide in
the formation waters is positive and quite strong,
compatible with a closed system reduction model
(Fig. 9.10). However, plots of sulphate against

sulphide concentrations and of both against their
respective isotopic compositions depart from ex-
pected closed system trends, suggesting that for
pristine Bridport Sands formation waters there was
differential loss of reduced sulphur and/or that the
formation waters had different initial sulphate con-
centrations. Loss of isotopically light, early formed
HzS can be demonstrated by calculation of the mean
isotopic composition of the total sulphur during a
period of well production. In a closed system, the
total sulphur isotopic composition should equal
that of the initial sulphur (which would have been
Jurassic seawater with 034S of approximately 160/00;
Claypool et ai., 1980). By calculating the propor-
tions of sulphur species produced over one month
and apportioning isotopic compositions accordingly,
a mean total sulphur isotopic composition works out
at 34 ±4%0. Significant loss of reduced sulphur must
indeed have occurred to drive the total sulphur
composition towards such heavy values. Different
initial sulphate concentrations in the formation
waters are demonstrated by data from (for example)

9.7.1 Introduction
Large volumes of heavy oil (bitumen) are reservoired
in
Cretaceous
sandstones
at
relatively
shallow
depths of a few hundred metres along the Alberta-
Saskatchewan
border
in
western
Canada, out-
cropping as the famous Athabasca Tar Sands (Fig.

9.6.5 Conclusions
Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data and chemical
analyses of Bridport Sands reservoir fluids indicate
that seawater breakthrough has occurred in one
well, but breakthrough does not appear to be
responsible for any increase in H2S production.
Analysis of the sulphur chemistry and sulphur iso-
topic composition of the produced fluids indicates
that closed system sulphate reduction is responsible
for H2S production, chiefly in the water leg of the
reservoir, although an unquantifiable amount of
H2S is being lost to the formation during sulphate
reduction.
Although the complexities of variable sulphur
chemistry in the Bridport Sands waters, along with
unquantifiable H2S loss, make quantitative predic-
tion of H2S concentrations somewhat fraught, the
relationship of increasing H2S with water cut from
the water zone (rather than from seawater break-
through) is a useful qualitative tool. Rising water
production from any Bridport Sands well which is
unrelated to seawater breakthrough may herald an
increase in H2S production.
well B3. The sulphur chemistry of B3 water pro-
duced during September 1985 differs from that of
fluids produced elsewhere in the Bridport reservoir
(and from that of fluids produced at other times
from well B3; Table 9.5).
The results indicate that although seawater break-
through is occurring, it is not responsible for en-
hanced H2S production. The Bridport reservoir
fluids have a spatially and temporally variable
sulphur chemistry and are losing H2S, although it is
not possible to quantify this loss. These conclusions
indicate that prediction of H2S production will be
difficult or impossible. However, one final piece of
evidence may be of predictive use. Production data
from the wells indicate that there is a relationship
between the H2S content of produced fluids and
water cut (Table 9.5). This relationship is inter-
preted to indicate greater H2S concentrations in the
water zone of the Bridport Sands, caused by the
greater extent of the closed system sulphate reduc-
tion in the water leg. Produced water from well D4,
for example, which has a low water cut and low H2S
concentration, is interpreted to have been derived
solely from the oil leg, whereas the rapid rise in
water cut and H2S concentration in well B8 is inter-
preted to represent a major contribution from the
water leg.

estimated to contain 75 x 109 m3 of bitumen* with
an API gravity of 10° and a viscosity of 4000-10 000
centipoise at 37.8°C (Proctor etal., 1984). The most
viable recovery methods for such heavy oil are
techniques which raise the
temperature of the
formation, promote thermal cracking and reduce
bitumen viscosity. The high temperature technique
normally used on Cold Lake sands is cyclic steam
injection, in which 80% steam and 20% water is
injected at high pressures (12 MPa) and temperat-
ures (300-320°C) into the reservoir for periods of
40-90 days. The injected mixture is left to heat the
reservoir for a further 40 days, following which
steam, condensed water, oil and gas are produced
from the injection wells at rates of approximately
100m3 per day (Shepherd, 1981). This process may
be repeated for 10 or more cycles.
The Cretaceous reservoir sandstones of the Cold
Lake area are buried to depths of 400-500 m, with
ambient reservoir temperatures of about
15°C.
During steam recovery, the physical conditions in
the reservoir are changed dramatically, altering not
only the properties of the bitumen, but also the
properties of the rock. Porosities and permeabilities
may be significantly reduced as new minerals are
precipitated, or existing water-sensitive minerals
such as swelling clays expand to fill porespaces.
Minerals may also be dissolved during steam injec-
tion,
enhancing
porosities
and
permeabilities.
Carbonate minerals, particularly calcite, may be
susceptible to dissolution and may also contribute
to CO2 produced at the wellhead during bitumen
recovery (Hutcheon et al., 1990). An understanding
of the pre-injection mineralogy of the rock matrix
and its likely behaviour during steam injection are
essential if oil recovery is to be maximized. The
objective of the study described below (Hutcheon
et al., 1989, 1990) was to constrain the types and
effects of rock-water reaction during steam injec-
tion using a combination of detailed petrography
and petrophysics, along with isotopic analysis of
carbonate minerals and produced CO2.
9.7.2 Geological background
The Cold Lake deposit covers an area of approx-
imately 9000 km2 with most bitumen reservoired in
the upper part of the Clearwater Formation, part of
the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) Mannville
Group (Minken, 1974). The Clearwater Formation
*This 'oil' is difficult to get into barrels.
is up to 80 m thick in the Cold Lake area, over 50 m
of which comprises sandstones deposited as deltaic
distributary mouth bars and in distributary channels
(Harrison et al., 1981). The distributary mouth bar
deposits contain the highest oil saturations and have
the best porosities and permeabilities. A representa-
tive summary log is shown in Fig. 9.12. The sedi-
ments are believed to have been sourced from a
distant, dominantly igneous terrain to the west
and south-west and the compositional immaturity
and relative coarseness of the sandstones suggest
rapid
deposition
(Putnam
&
Pedskalny,
1983).
Petrographic analysis of the Clearwater sandstones
shows them to be fine- to medium-grained, angular
to subangular and lithofeldspathic in composition.
Diagenesis of the sandstones was complex, with
early pyrite, quartz, potassium feldspar and albite
overgrowths and calcite, chlorite, illite, siderite
and smectite cements. Diagenesis also resulted in
framework grain dissolution and precipitation of
clinoptilolite and opal, and was followed by oil
emplacement. The latest diagenetic effects in the
sandstones are related to the influx of relatively
fresh water causing kaolinite precipitation and oil
fermentation and degradation. An additional prod-
uct of oil degradation was an isotopically distinct
post-bitumen calcite cement (Hutcheon et al., 1989).
9.7.3 Approach
Sampled cores came from a steam injection project
approximately lOkm west of Cold Lake (Fig. 9.11).
The first core, from well Tl, was cut before steam
injection started. The second core, from well EX
only 15 m away from Tl, was cut after more than
2 years of continuous steam injection on a five-
spot pattern (one central injection well and four
surrounding production wells). Temperatures in this
well had reached 260°C but were lower (200°C) by
the time the core was cut. The Clearwater Forma-
tion interval selected for steam injection and sampled
in both wells was a relatively clean sandstone, prob-
ably of distributary mouth bar or channel origin.
Following core description of both wells, 100 thin-
sections were examined in detail from both wells: 40
samples were examined by analytical SEM and a
further 80 were analysed by XRD to determine
bulk-rock and < 2 J!m fraction mineralogies. The
changes in mineralogy between the two wells were
then compared to changes in porosity and perme-
ability and to observed changes in oil production
rate.

Fig. 9.12 Summary stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Clearwater Formation (from Hutcheon et al., 1989).
Later work on another Cold Lake steam injection
project in Clearwater sandstones was concerned
more specifically with the origin of the CO2 gen-
erated during steam injection (Hutcheon et al.,
1990). The approach taken here was to obtain
produced water, oil and gas samples from three
wells in their first cycle of steam injection and
recovery. Water samples were filtered in the field,
and total alkalinity, pH, sulphide and ammonia
measured. Carbonate species in produced waters
were preserved fOT isotopic analysis and CO2 and
CH4 contents of produced gases were measured by
gas chromatography. The isotopic compositions of
the separated gases were also measured, along with
those of about 40 calcite samples extracted from
Clearwater sandstones.
9.7.4 Petrographic and isotopic investigations of
steam-induced reactions
Petrographic and petrophysical studies of wells Tl
and EX showed a distinct change in rock mineralogy
and reservoir quality in the steamed interval. The

Steam injection into Clearwater Formation sand-

The l3C-depleted CO2 of the produced species may
have been derived from several sources as illustrated

l3C-enriched CO2 must have been supplied from the
breakdown of calcite.
ceptible to alteration, changing from an assemblage
of illite, chlorite, zeolites and smectite to one
dominated by smectite and analcime. A two-fold
increase in the relative amount of smectite was
detected by < 21lm fraction XRD analysis; the new
smectite was also coarser (4-10 Ilm). Analcime, a
sodic zeolite, petrographically the last phase to form
in the steamed interval, formed euhedral crystals
10-15 Ilm across. The framework grains were not
substantially affected by steam injection with only
a limited amount of pitting and etching of grain
surfaces, although chemically less stable volcano-
genic grains acted as nuclei for the precipitation of
new minerals.
New mineral growth, especially that of smectite,
led to decreased bulk porosity and permeability in
the steamed interval and thus to decreased oil pro-
duction rates. Thick smectite rims on framework
grains increased the surface area of the porespace
mineral assemblage, which led to an increase in
the proportion of microporosity and reduced perme-
ability.
Smectite
and analcime are
believed to
have formed by reaction of kaolinite and feldspar,
mainly on the surface of lithic clasts, with sodic
waters. Porosity and permeability reduction are also
believed to have been partly caused by compaction
of the rock framework during flushing of the oil.
As well as reducing reservoir quality, steam injec-
tion has also been associated with the production
of COz from the Clearwater Sandstones. COz com-
prised about 40% of the produced gas (Hutcheon
et aI., 1990). Other produced gases included CH4,
water vapour and air entrained during steam injec-
tion. Isotopic analyses of the COz, dissolved carbon-
ate and carbonate cements (predominantly calcite)
in the reservoir indicated that nearly all the COz was
derived from dissolution of diagenetic calcite at
temperatures between 70 and 220°C (Fig. 9.13).
Alkalinity measurements of the produced waters
also confirm that calcite was being dissolved (though
the concentration of Caz+ in the waters did not
equal alkalinity, suggesting that Caz+ was being
consumed by reaction with clay minerals to form
zeolites). Very little COz was apparently derived
from the pyrolysis of bitumen and this small quantity
was contributed early on in the production cycle.
When combined with data from other steam injec-
tion pilot studies (Cathles et aI., 1987), it is evi-
dent that significant quantities of COz production
should be expected from formations with appro-
priate mineralogy: carbonates (calcite, dolomite and
siderite) and silicates (kaolinite, smectite and illite).

sandstones (from Hutcheon & Lebebvre, 1988).
9.8.3 Approach
Two cored wells were studied in detail from the
fireflood area of the Aberfeldy Field by Lefebvre
(1984), B7A and B7, some 50m apart. Both wells
were drilled in 1975, with only B7 being contacted
by the burn front. As with the Cold Lake study

deposition is interpreted as a wave-dominated delta
(van Hulten & Smith, 1984). The best reservoir
properties are found in the sandstones capping the
coarsening-upward units. Unlike the lithofeldspathic
Clearwater sandstones of Cold Lake, these are sub-
litharenites with some glauconite, well sorted and
mature. A variety of diagenetic minerals have been
precipitated in the Sparky sandstones (Fig. 9.14)
but except where carbonate cementation has been
locally pervasive, porosities have remained high (up
to 30%) and permeabilities may be as high as a few
darcys (Adams, 1982).
in a loss of porosity and reduced permeability,
even in the relatively clean sandstones chosen for
the steam injection pilot. Relationships between
mineral growth, porosity reduction and decreased
recovery rates suggest that if steam were injected
into sandstones of initially lower porosity and/or
higher clay content, recovery rates would be sig-
nificantly reduced. CO2 production during steam
injection has apparently been caused by carbonate
dissolution with Ca2+ being consumed by reactions
with clay minerals.
9.8 Enhanced oil recovery - fireflooding:
Lloydminster Area Oil Sands,
Saskatchewan, Canada
9.8.1 Introduction
South of the Cold Lake Oil Sands lie the heavy oil
fields of the Lloydminster area (Fig. 9.11). Like
their Cold Lake counterparts, these fields contain
heavy oil reservoired in Cretaceous sandstones,
although the oil here can be produced in part by
conventional
primary
and
secondary
recovery
methods as it has densities of 16-24° API and
viscosities of 400-1500 centipoise.
This case study involves monitoring a fireflooding
pilot in the Aberfeldy Field, 15 km to the east
of Lloydminster (Lefebvre
&
Hutcheon,
1986;
Hutcheon & Lefebvre, 1988). The reservoir of
interest is the Lower Cretaceous Sparky Interval of
the Mannville Group, which has yielded between
5.2 and 8.3% of original oil-in-place during primary
recovery and secondary recovery by water flooding.
Enhanced oil recovery by fireflooding and steam-
flooding is expected to yield a recovery of 9.5% of
oil-in-place (Adams, 1982). For the purposes of this
case study, only the results of the fireflood will be
described in detail.
9.8.2 Geological background
The Lower Cretaceous Sparky Interval is the most
prolific oil producer in the Lloydminster area, con-
taining up to 60% of the proven reserves and having
the best reservoir properties (Orr et ai., 1977). The
Sparky Interval is up to several tens of metres thick
and is divided into four depositional units (Smith,
1984) with a basal bioturbated lagoonal mudstone,
followed by three coarsening-upward units inter-
preted as shoreface deposits, which are in turn

described in Section 9.7, both wells were examined
in
detail
using
thin-section
petrography,
SEM
and XRD (bulk and < 2 jlm fraction) analysis of 32
samples. Porosity, permeability and residual water
and oil saturation measurements were also made on
core from both wells.
9.8.4 Petrographic investigation of mineralogical
changes
The main mineralogical changes observed following
fireflooding
were
illite
formation,
the
thermal
decomposition of diagenetic kaolinite (Lefebvre &
Hutcheon, 1986) and the crystallization of potassium
feldspar and haematite. Illite growth is generally
restricted to the periphery of burned zones where
coke is present. Decomposed kaolinite (as indicated
by XRD) is still recognizable with SEM but is poorly
formed; it is still the most volumetrically significant
clay mineral present. Feldspar is most commonly
observed to have grown in the intensely burned
zones, forming a few small euhedral crystals a
few micrometres across. The burned zones in the
core show a distinct reddish coloration caused by
the precipitation of small amounts of haematite
(identified by XRD and SEM). Haematite is most
abundant in association with shale and volcanic rock
fragments, from which much of its iron was presum-
ably derived (some of this iron was also from
diagenetic siderite).
Changes in reservoir properties associated with
the fireflooding
were relatively minor.
Porosity
and
permeability
were
slightly
reduced in
the
burned zones, due to the formation of illite and
haematite and the deposition of coke. However,
these poroperm changes are of no significance to
future recovery of any heavy oil in the burned
zones as oil saturation was reduced to zero in these
intervals. It is important to note that the best de-
veloped burned zones actually lie beneath per-
meability barriers which have prevented overriding
of injected air during fireflooding.
9.8.5 Conclusions
The main conclusion from this study is that fire-
flooding of the Sparky Interval has not resulted in
volumetrically
significant
mineralogical
changes.
Consequently, the reservoir quality of the fireflooded
interval has been little affected, apart from minor
poroperm reductions in the burned zone in which
oil saturation has been reduced to zero in any case.
This contrasts markedly with the major minera-
logical
changes and
associated deterioration of
reservoir quality observed in the steamflooding
pilot of the Clearwater sandstones. Lefebvre and
Hutcheon (1986) attribute this different behaviour
not to the different thermal recovery techniques, but
to the depositional and diagenetic mineralogies
of the Clearwater and Sparky sandstones. The rela-
tively
unstable
mineralogies
of
the
Clearwater
sandstones -
containing abundant feldspars and
lithic
fragments,
carbonate
cements
and
other
diagenetic phases, including smectite -
underwent
volumetrically significant changes in mineralogy
during steamflooding causing poroperm reduction.
By contrast, the more stable non-reactive quartzose
sands of the Sparky Interval underwent little dia-
genetic
change
and
poroperm
loss.
There
is
obviously a need for a careful and thorough minera-
logical and chemical description of any reservoir
interval before thermal recovery techniques are
initiated

the
reservoir.
