Setting Up for 
Failure
Thomas Edison could have been talking about the Customer Trap when he 
observed, “many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close 
they were when they gave up.”
For companies who initially pour all that they have into building great  
products, services, and brands, nothing is more depressing than watching them 
fail when it comes to the critical next step. Still, falling into a dysfunctional  
relationship with a Mega-Customer is not something that just happens, but 
is an intentional strategy.

The Biggest 
Business 
Mistake
When you find yourself in the majority, pause and reflect.
—Mark Twain
Many of the people who lead companies, from huge multinationals to brand-new 
startups, think that if they can just get their product or service into the hands 
of a Mega-Customer, all their problems will somehow magically disappear. 
The thinking goes like this: “If we can make enough sales, profits will rise, 
business will grow, and we will be unimaginably successful. The trick is to find 
ever-bigger customers who can buy increasingly larger quantities of what we 
produce.”
One of the most influential developments since the turn of the century has 
been the rise of large-scale customers across the business spectrum. We 
call these Mega-Customers. The temptation to search out Mega-Customers 
is almost irresistible. After all, they exist in every sector of the economy.  
In consumer retail, it is the big boxes: Walmart, The Home Depot, and all 
the rest. Online it is Amazon.com. AutoNation and Penske Corporation that 
drive a great deal of the automotive industry in America. Boeing and Airbus 
dominate aviation, as do AT&T and Verizon in telecom. In flowers it’s FTD 
Companies, Teleflora, and 1-800-Flowers.com. And, of course, at the top sits 
the US federal government, with the nearly $1 trillion it spends in the private

sector each year. Uncle Sam is the single largest buyer of everything from 
paper clips to pharmaceuticals, trucks, cell phones, airline tickets, legal ser-
vices, energy, hotel rooms, medical care, and information technology.
The perceived benefits of selling to a Mega-Customer are compelling, to be 
sure. Broader exposure to a wider expanse of the marketplace results—it 
is assumed—in substantial increases in sales. It also promises the chance to 
streamline customer management; to have only a few customers instead of 
hundreds or thousands. Both benefits are attractive, particularly in an era of 
relentless competition and disruption. Who wouldn’t want to bring a few 
Megas on board?
However, this kind of thinking is shallow and dangerous. Ideas and the  
decisions we make around them have consequences. The risk is that once the 
decision has been made to go with the Mega-Customer, there is no turning 
back, as forces beyond the control of the producing firm quickly and inexora-
bly takes over.
We’re reminded of one of our former students, Sam. He was the kind of 
kid who you just knew was going to do well in business. He asked the right 
questions and was always exploring the best way to do things. His attention 
to detail was astounding. During college, Sam ran a pretty successful land-
scaping / snow removal company. He had two trucks, eight employees, and 
around 200 residential and commercial customers. Business was good and 
growing at a steady, sustainable pace. After he graduated, Sam continued 
to add crews each year, along with more and more customers. He made it 
through the Great Recession and even picked up accounts from competi-
tors who couldn’t survive. He was celebrated by the local media and named 
an emerging business leader. Eventually Sam’s firm was one of the fastest 
growing landscaping companies in the region. He was well on his way.
One day Sam called one of this book’s authors, Andrew, and said he was facing a 
tough decision. The biggest bank in the region had sent out a request for bid to 
handle the mowing, planting, landscape maintenance, and snow removal for its 
nearly 100 branches and offices. It was an 18-month contract. Sam said getting 
the contract would likely double his overall business, and he wanted to know 
if he should submit a bid. Andrew told him to be careful, and to not allow the 
bank to swallow up what had become a successful business. Dishearteningly, 
what Sam was really looking for was validation. He had already made up his 
mind to chase the big whale.
Not surprisingly, given his reputation in the marketplace, Sam won the bid. 
The bank instantly became 50 percent of his entire revenue stream, which 
meant that he had to immediately lease more equipment and trucks, and 
he had to hire a lot more people. Money flowed in, and money flowed out. 
Inevitably, internal resources—most important, Sam’s famous attention to 
detail—were steered away from his original client base and toward the new

Mega-Customer. Service to the “originals” suffered, and many left. Still, it was, 
overall, a winning proposition. For the next year and a half, Sam was well on 
his way to becoming a very young millionaire. He bought a new home in a 
high-end neighborhood, a new Porsche Cayenne, and a new boat.
And then, 18 months later, the bank did what the bank had always done: it issued 
a new request for bid. Sam assumed that since he had performed so well 
for them, his contract would automatically be renewed. He was shocked, 
however, when he learned that the new bid asked for a price 20 percent 
less than the one Sam had negotiated 18 months earlier. That 20 percent 
was his margin!
Not without dismay, Sam “sharpened his pencil” and submitted a new bid, 
knowing that he was going to have to dramatically cut costs to stay ahead. He 
won the contract again, but he had to pay his employees less. Many of the best 
people left and went to work for his competitors. Service further suffered. 
More original customers departed. In 2011, fuel prices spiked, further hurting 
Sam’s business.
By the end of the second 18-month contract, Sam was struggling to make payroll 
and the lease payments on his equipment. (He also quietly sold the new home, 
the Porsche, and the boat.) Needless to say, Sam didn’t submit a third bid 
when the bank announced it was looking for a new supplier once again.
With the weight of the Mega-Customer off his back, Sam believed that he 
could start over with a wide base of residential and commercial customers. 
The problem was that his brand had become tarnished over the past three 
years. Word-of-mouth had spread about the poor service that Sam’s business 
was now providing. Most of his old customers had moved on: snow, rain, and 
sunshine were not waiting for Sam to figure things out. There were driveways 
to clear and grass to shorten, and somebody else would be doing it. Sam is 
now selling cars at a local dealership.
It’s a Common Story
Before you think this is merely the story of a young kid who did not know the 
ways of the world, we would like to remind you that similar cases over the 
past few decades have played out tens of thousands of times inside companies 
that were exponentially bigger than Sam’s. What’s more, they had experi-
enced leaders who should have known better.
Let’s look at another story, this time from a nationally recognized company 
that also fell into the Customer Trap. You might remember David Oreck, 
the founder of the vacuum cleaner company that bears his name. Television 
commercials featuring Mr. Oreck with a bowling ball over his head 
being held in place by one of his vacuum cleaners became cult favorites.  

Chapter 1 | The Biggest Business Mistake
6
For 40 years his company was the kind of example that business students 
and emerging entrepreneurs were taught to emulate: the innovative, domestic 
manufacturer—supported by a direct sales strategy—that kept control of 
its products and brands.
We even once met Mr. Oreck when he spoke at our university. He 
was rightfully proud of what he had spent a lifetime to build. Hardworking 
Americans were paid a good day’s wage making his products in Louisiana 
and Tennessee. He shunned the big-box stores at every turn—even calling 
Walmart “China Mart.”
Exclusive franchises and corporate-owned stores kept the brand equity high. 
They sold only Oreck products. They were, along with the company’s web 
site and call centers, the only places where somebody could buy an Oreck 
product. Many models cost over $1,000 and carried a 25-year warranty—
something unheard of anywhere else in the household goods industry. The 
business grew. The brand got stronger. Franchisees and consumers were true 
believers, and the product attained an almost mystical status.
And, then, Mr. Oreck decided to sell the company. He sold it in 2003 to 
American Securities Capital Partners, a private-equity firm that proceeded to 
suck the life out of the business and left others “holding a big, ol’ dusty bag 
full of debt.”1 The private-equity geniuses proceeded to wreck the company 
almost overnight by deciding to sell through Target. The exclusive franchisees, 
many of them loyal for more than 30 years, were pushed aside in favor of the 
new, bigger-volume Mega-Customer. The solid customer relationships 
Mr. Oreck had built over decades were immediately cannibalized. No one 
would pay $1,000 anymore for a vacuum cleaner that was now sold like a bag 
of bricks or any other commodity at a big-box retailer. The brand was ruined. 
The Oreck fanatics were thrown aside, sacrificed at the altar of big volume.
Remarkably, as the company predictably fell into bankruptcy, the new leaders 
of the firm had the chutzpah to blame the company’s demise on not selling 
out to the big boxes fast enough. They said the transition in how they sold 
and distributed vacuum cleaners—by selling through large retailers instead of 
directly to customers—took longer than expected.2 So, if we follow the logic 
here, the company was ruined because they couldn’t destroy it fast enough.
You can’t make this stuff up.

The Customer Trap

So What, Exactly, Is a Mega-Customer?
Simply put, a Mega-Customer is a customer that accounts for more than 10 percent 
of the total amount of sales. Why 10 percent? Is this some arbitrary number? 
Where does it come from?
Part of the explanation is intuitive. Putting a lot of eggs in one—or even a 
few—baskets can prove wonderful so long as those big customers stay 
profitable and loyal. However, change in business, as in life, is inevitable. The 
minute big customers change their minds, leave, or threaten to do so unless 
dramatic concessions are met, catastrophic situations can arise. Most of us 
would remember if we had a major account that announced it was taking its 
business somewhere else unless it got a dramatic price reduction. Such moments 
can cause grave harm, or even threaten the entire future of a company.
A more substantive reason for not exceeding 10 percent comes from the 
practice of managerial accounting. In 1974, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) established financial accounting standards for financial report-
ing by nongovernmental organizations. These standards are recognized as 
authoritative by the American institute of Certified Public Accountants and 
that Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).3
The FASB has codified the language of accounting in its Statement[s] of 
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS). These formal documents detail stan-
dards and guidance on selected accounting policies. The FASB issues these 
standards with the expectation that all reporting companies listed on US stock 
exchanges will adhere to them. Such standards are created to ensure a higher 
level of corporate transparency. In other words, this is all designed to provide 
outsiders a better look at what is going on inside a publicly traded company.
For our purposes, we are interested in SFAS 131:
An enterprise shall provide information about the extent of its 
reliance on its major customers. If revenues from transactions 
with a single external customer amount to 10 percent or more of an 
enterprise’s revenues, the enterprise shall disclose that fact, the total 
amount of revenues from each such customer, and the identity of 
the segment or segments reporting the revenues.4
In layperson speak, this means that under the accepted financial accounting stan-
dards of the United States, a publicly traded company must disclose if a cus-
tomer is more than 10 percent of its total sales. Why? Because according to the 
accepted standards, a customer that represents more than 10 percent of total 
sales is a potential risk to the firm that outsiders should be made aware of.

The 10 Percent Rule
So why would the accountants come up with 10 percent as the benchmark 
for disclosure? We believe that it is because the 10 Percent Rule just makes 
sense.
As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus rightly put it, “Nothing endures but 
change.” Customers come—and they go. For example, if a company has ten 
customers, and they are each about 10 percent of the total sales, and one or 
two of them fall away, the company will most likely survive. It might be tough 
sailing for a while. Nevertheless, replacing the two lost customers and their  
20 percent of revenue is by no means impossible.
But what about a company that has ten customers, nine of which are  
60 percent of the business, plus one—a Mega-Customer—that is responsible 
for 40 percent of all its revenue? What happens to that company when the 
Mega-Customer makes unrealistic demands, gets sold, goes out of business, or 
something else occurs? Replacing 40 percent of sales is a tough proposition, 
even on a good day. And what about a customer that is more than 40 percent 
of the business?
The same can be true if a significant portion of a company’s revenue is con-
nected to one industry. For example, how many companies were nearly wiped 
out when their customers in the travel and tourism sector were crippled after 
the September 11 attacks? In short, overdependency on one Mega-Customer, 
or one industry, can be devastating.
Something else regularly happens when a company violates the 10 Percent 
Rule: the Mega-Customer starts to tamper with the supplier’s operations, 
ultimately forcing the supplier to accept and do things that would not have 
otherwise been considered. Of course, these activities are all designed to 
increase the profitability of the Mega-Customer, frequently at the expense of 
the supplier. A few common examples include the following:
Changing payment terms. (“Now that we are so important 
• 
to you, we are going to take more time to pay you.”)
Requiring suppliers to buy, learn, and use completely new 
• 
information technology systems. (“Your systems are OK, 
yet to do business with us, you need to invest in a new 
system, bought through our own provider.”)
Charging for every little thing. (“Your truck was 10 minutes 
• 
late; we will charge you X. We didn’t sell all of the inven-
tory we ordered, so we are charging you Y to have you 
move it out of our warehouse.”)

The Customer Trap

Providing access to the innovator’s formulas and trade 
• 
secrets. This is usually done under the guise of “quality 
assurance.” And, of course, once that knowledge gets out, 
it doesn’t go back into the tube.
Holding hostage vital information about how the prod-
• 
uct or service takes its path to market. (“Since we are 
the customer, we have the right to not share information 
about your product with you.”)
At the core of the Customer Trap is the promise of incredible wealth. Every 
supplier who gets a product or service accepted by the dominant player in 
their industry gets rich, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. The 
trap is sprung when Fortune 500 companies—or mom-and-pop stores—make 
the conscious decision to seek out a relationship with a Mega-Customer.
By the time the supplier figures out that a new reality is taking over, it has 
already entered the Customer Trap. The outcomes are predictable and heart-
breaking. Product life cycles are dramatically reduced, turning hard-fought 
innovations into commodities. Long-standing brands and whole sectors are 
wiped out and become a shell of their former selves. Domestic operations are 
shuttered in favor of the low-cost advantages of outsourcing and offshoring.  
And despite strenuous efforts to continually reduce costs, profits cannot  
be found.
But It’s Not the Mega-Customer’s Fault!
Before we go any further, and you think this is merely another book point-
ing a finger at the giant retailors of the world for the ills they bring to local 
communities, let us be clear: we do not blame Megas for the problem of the 
Customer Trap and what it leads to. We believe that the true responsibility 
for a company’s products and services lies with that same company. Nobody 
at FTD, Walmart, Amazon, the federal government, or any other potential 
Mega-Customer forces a supplier to come knocking on its door.
Whether it is out of naïveté, arrogance, or greed, companies that expect a 
Mega-Customer to treat them kindly—and to respect their brands, products, 
and services—are tragically misguided. What business leaders do not know, 
what they forget, or what they ignore, is that a strategy based on pursuing the 
Mega-Customer is inherently flawed.
And, yet, this is exactly what has happened repeatedly during the past decades. 
The shift occurred when marketing began to adopt the objectives of supply-
chain management, where scale and efficiency dominate. While producers 
focused on perfecting their internal capabilities, Mega-Customers, operating 
under the radar of most business-school professors, management consultants, 

Chapter 1 | The Biggest Business Mistake
10
and the business press, came to dominate every sector of the economy. The 
message to producers was clear: “Your job is to be ‘lean’ and ‘efficient’ and—at 
the same time—continuously deliver ‘customer value’ to the marketplace.”
On the production and operations side, Six Sigma and other industry certifica-
tions are undoubtedly critical components of efficiency that need to be part of 
a company’s DNA. But what about the customer side of the enterprise? This 
is where the delusion enters in. For example, how many companies believe 
that outsourcing a customer call center to India, in the name of efficiency and 
lower costs, is a good idea? We already know the answer.
Let’s use Walmart as an example. It has around 125,000 suppliers. Because 
of its size, the retailer is the largest customer for the vast majority of these  
vendors. In the lexicon of efficiency, it makes sense to deal with just one  
customer like Walmart. Still, ask most of those suppliers how their profits 
stack up next to Walmart, year after year, and you’ll likely hear anything but 
nice words.
Walmart’s inevitable price cuts force manufacturers to lower costs, which may 
mean sending production offshore to China, designing quality out of a product, 
limiting research and development (R&D), and outsourcing service and repair. 
The result is the erosion of value for the consumer, as cost-cutting mea-
sures forced upon the producer by the Mega diminish the very attributes that 
attracted buyers to the product in the first place. It is difficult to make a last-
ing compromise between efficiency and value, because the quest for greater 
efficiency is by far the more powerful force and continually encroaches on 
customer value through repeated compromises.
Here’s an example: Jones Soda used to be a hip, niche producer whose initial 
sales and distribution strategy was built around selling through unique comple-
mentors including tattoo parlors and snowboarding shops. The company had 
a small sales force that sought to grow the brand through its unique distribu-
tion channel. It was a solid model: an innovative manufacturer selling through 
loyal distributors, and eventually to Panera Bread and Barnes & Noble.
Then the CEO at the time got a brilliant idea: to expand sales and distribution 
further by selling through Target and other Mega-Customers. It was a tipping 
point, if you will. Sales volume surged, but profits evaporated. The company 
hemorrhaged money and has never really earned a profit since. Fast-forward 
to today: the stock is stuck at around 35 cents a share.5 Another CEO is 
brought in. What is the new strategy? To sell in 3,600 Walmart stores, so as 
to increase sales volume. Wow.
5On December 27, 2014, the company’s share value was 0.34. It peaked in April 2008 at 
around $28.22 per share, just prior to the deal with Target.

The Customer Trap
11
Who Is Responsible?
To be fair, business leaders who drank the elixir of the Mega-Customer were 
players in a drama that began in the United States in the 1980s and has since 
spread around the world. Innovative companies and the people who led them 
were responding to what management theorists were saying at the time. These 
business gurus talked about organizational transformation—emphasizing core 
competencies, resources, capabilities, innovation, technology, and operational 
effectiveness. Methodologies such as total quality management, lean manufac-
turing, and Six Sigma were just some of the solutions preached by the business 
elites to companies of all sizes.
The Megas are both the by-products and the cause of a contagion that has 
spread across American business and is now being exported to the rest of 
the world. Beginning in the early 1980s, US manufacturers and service provid-
ers moved aggressively away from vertical integration and began to outsource 
many of their business activities. The concept of core competence, which is a 
mainstay of management education, was given as the primary rationale for  
jettisoning sales and distribution. 
The idea was that the leaders of an organization should identify those areas 
where they excelled—where they brought true value to the marketplace—
and dump everything else. Why manage a string of small customers, dealers, 
or franchisees when your core competency—your basis of differentiation—is 
in R&D, innovation, or manufacturing? Taking this advice, companies divested 
themselves of activities that were not perceived as value-added, and they 
pushed sales and distribution aside. Thousands of businesses that had previ-
ously been in control of all aspects of their innovative development began to 
lose interest in sales and distribution, preferring instead that specialists take 
over this “business function.” Ironically, this created a marketplace vacuum that  
the Megas rapidly filled. Soon, the very companies that had taken over these  
noncore activities began to exert control at the core level, highjacking  
the ­strategic direction of the producing companies that had given them life 
in the first place. This, combined with a rash of international mergers and 
­acquisitions, takeovers, and consolidations in the early 2000s, fueled the evolu-
tion of massive distributors in every industry, which became the driving force 
behind the sales and distribution of innovative products and services in the 
United States and around the world.
Today, most products and services are controlled by entities other than the 
ones that created these products and services. We find that, overwhelmingly, 
the ability of companies to get their innovations into the hands of consumers 
is blocked, thwarted, and controlled by Mega-Customers. Manufacturers do 
not even have control over the prices they can charge. This is evidenced by 
mandates from Mega-Customers who, year after year, impose price reduc-
tions while insisting that their suppliers maintain high standards of quality.  
This is the Customer Trap in action.

Chapter 1 | The Biggest Business Mistake
12
Still, in the end, the responsibility and, ultimately, the accountability for the rise 
of Mega-Customers sits squarely on the shoulders of those executives who 
decided to outsource their sales and distribution to the Megas in the first 
place. It was their call and their decision. It is critical to understand that when 
we talk about responsibility and accountability, it is individuals who must be 
held to account, not intangible things like corporations.
For every important responsibility, such as developing a sales and distribution 
strategy, there is accountability. It is the obligation of each person to answer 
for the discharge of responsibilities that affect others. Accountability includes 
being responsible for intentions as well as results. Whenever someone has an 
important obligation, they must answer to stakeholders for their decisions. 
What we find far too often is that executives, who at one time bought into 
the temptation of doing business with a Mega-Customer and now realize that 
they are caught in the Customer Trap, engage in the blame game. They say 
things like, “Well, we didn’t know that this was going to happen to us.” Or, 
“We didn’t think that this was going to be the end result.”
But, as your parents used to say, those you associate with define you. If you 
decide to travel to Bentonville, for example, and sit across the table from 
Walmart’s buyers, and you then allow Walmart or any other Mega-Customer 
into your company, you have to fully accept the consequences of that action.
Mega-Customers are everywhere. They do not lie about who they are. Contrary 
to the conventional wisdom—and as we make clear in this book—they are 
not the only option. And they are most certainly not the best one. Doing 
business with Mega-Customers is not inevitable, nor a fait accompli. It is only 
when companies decide to search out and do business with a Mega-Customer 
that the Customer Trap becomes a reality. To provide you a clearer under-
standing of this all-too-common business mistake, we’ll spend the next four 
chapters laying it out. A warning: this is not for the faint of heart.

The Customer 
Trap and Brand 
Destruction
Nobody ever did, or ever will, escape the consequences of his choices.
—Alfred A. Montapert
The Customer Trap can lead to the destruction of many vital parts of a  
business. The power that a Mega-Customer is able to wield simply overwhelms 
the strategic toolkit of its supplier. As the Mega-Customer gains leverage, the 
producing firm loses control over its destiny and is soon nothing more than a 
colony serving the needs and wants of its colonial master. Once this happens, 
it is almost impossible to regain control. This is probably nowhere more easily 
seen than in the area of branding. The scope and magnitude of a deal with a 
Mega-Customer can quickly erode the brand equity of individual products and 
services. Ultimately, it will ruin the overall brand image of a company.
Whether your company is a small manufacturer, local retailer, or a Fortune 
500 conglomerate, the quality and resonance of your brands is imperative.
What is a brand? It is an intangible set of perceptions that represents the 
essence of a company and the products and services it offers. This is ­supported 
by the rational, functional, and emotional attributes those products and services 
stand for. And, as the saying goes, “Perception often is reality.”

The moment Oreck placed its products alongside the cheap, Chinese-made 
vacuums stacked against the nondescript walls of Target stores, for example, 
perceptions about the brand were incontrovertibly altered. Consumers now 
think about the brand in a fundamentally different way; the premium luster has 
been tarnished. Oreck is damaged goods.
The same is true when businesses such as restaurants, spas, dance studios, 
dermatologists, and automotive repair shops offer deals through Groupon, 
LivingSocial, Amazon Local, and similar web sites. These intermediaries can 
quickly become Mega-Customers to the providers. Producers are too easily 
persuaded that any losses incurred by lowering their prices will be more than 
offset by gains in sales volume. And rather than having to build relationships 
and market to a wide variety of clients (something that is both time-consuming 
and expensive), the Mega-Customer will take care of it for them.
The thinking goes like this: “We might be giving a spa treatment for 30 percent 
less through our Groupon special, but think of how many more spa treat-
ments we’ll be able to sell. And we won’t have to worry about advertising and 
marketing because Groupon is doing that for us!”
This back-of-the-envelope approach to business strategy is more than 
­dangerous. It fails to take into account the other costs associated with  
discounting through a Mega-Customer. An unintended but real consequence 
is the diminution of the brand. Once consumers see the brand associated with 
these kinds of deals, they will wait until the next round of deals are offered 
before considering a purchase. This puts the service provider into a down-
ward spiral of constantly having to offer better deals in order to meet or beat 
their competitors, who are themselves selling through the Mega-Customer. 
These kinds of sites do not offer exclusivity. Instead, they pit producers 
directly against one another. Moreover, consumers will not develop loyalty 
to the service provider, but instead to the intermediary. Customer loyalty 
becomes based on the deal of the day, rather than the value provided by the 
product or service.
In this chapter, we’ll take an in-depth look at two long-standing brands that 
have been effectively ruined by the Customer Trap. The harm caused to both 
Levi Strauss & Co. and Goodyear at the hands of their Mega-Customers  
provides an object lesson in the dangers of seeking to maximize volume at all 
other costs.
Levi Strauss Gives It Away
If there was ever such a thing as an iconic American brand, it was Levi Strauss 
& Co. Their jeans, ubiquitous for more than a century, were at the very center 
of American culture. Cowboys and aspiring cowboys strapped oversized belt 
buckles to their Levi’s in rural Wyoming; hippies and their cultural progeny 

The Customer Trap
15
put on prefaded versions; and almost everyone in between wore the jeans in 
some fashion. Levi’s were the stuff of legend. James Dean wore them in Rebel 
Without a Cause. They even played a role in the Cold War. Time magazine 
reported in 1962 that bureaucrats in the former Soviet Union opposed their 
corrupting influence. “There is even a blue-jean fad to the anger of militant 
party stalwarts, who note acidly the blue denim must have been smuggled in 
from abroad since it is not even manufactured in the Soviet Union.”1 Smuggling 
jeans into Russia during the dark days of communism financed many European 
adventures for young Americans.
Levi Strauss is named after its founder, who created the rugged jeans for the 
miners of the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. Strauss hired a tailor to 
make pants out of the brown canvas he had carried across the country to San 
Francisco. After he ran out of material, he was able to source a new supply 
from the town of Nimes, France. This material, known there as serge de Nimes, 
was anglicized into the simpler word “denim.” Strauss colored the fabric blue, 
and then he and his successors scrambled for a century to keep up with sales. 
The company had revenues of $2.4 million in 1880. Innovations such as fasten-
ing seams with rivets and branding (the kind involved with a hot iron) with 
numbers—the first was the now famous 501—followed.
During the first half of the 20th century, the firm struggled against both 
­adversarial economic conditions and a lack of visionary leadership. Nonetheless, 
circumstances helped the company to break out of its regional market. Visits 
to western dude ranches by easterners during the 1930s, coupled with the 
appearance of blue jeans in hundreds of Hollywood westerns, created a 
­mystique around this unique product.
During World War II, the US government declared Levi’s to be essential 
to the war effort and made them exclusively available to defense workers. 
Pent-up consumer demand after the war created an ongoing product shortage. 
With only five factories, Levi Strauss was forced to implement a distribution  
program that favored the intermediaries and retailers that it had worked 
with during the preceding decades. In 1948, company profits were more than  
$1 million on the sale of 4 million pairs of jeans.
In the 1950s, noticing that America was in the midst of a baby boom, the 
­company shifted its attention in the direction of the youth market, emphasiz-
ing that its pants were for play, not just work. The firm’s sales force became 
national in scope, focusing more on urban than rural stores. New innovations 
followed, including zippers instead of the five-button fly, preshrunk denim 
jeans, stretch denim, corduroys, and permanent press. The firm grew at an

outstanding pace. From 1963 to 1966, sales doubled to $152 million. In 1968, 
Levi Strauss had sales of $200 million. It had become the sixth-largest cloth-
ing producer in the United States. Still, it was unable to keep up with demand. 
Despite domestic and international challenges in the 1970s, sales topped $1 
billion in 1974 and then doubled four years later.
In the early 1980s, the demand for denim jeans slowed, prompting Levi Strauss 
to make its initial foray into the mass market. Deals were struck with Mega-
Customers J.C. Penney and Sears. However, earnings dropped by 25 percent, 
and in 1982 the company shuttered nine plants and eliminated 2,000 jobs. 
Despite beefed-up advertising alliances with the high-end fashion market, and 
an Olympic tie-in in 1984, profits were down 50 percent by the middle of the 
decade.
Still, Levi Strauss was able to dig itself out of the hole through the introduc-
tion of new products, including Dockers and stonewashed jeans. Sales and 
distribution in the 1990s was extended to upscale stores like Macy’s, as well 
as company-operated, stand-alone Dockers and Levi’s stores. By 1996, the 
firm was debt free, had robust operations across Europe, was expanding into 
emerging markets such as India and China, and produced strong earnings.2
And, then, seemingly almost overnight, everything changed. In an SEC filing in 
2000, the company outlined its precarious financial condition. A mere four 
years earlier, it had been on a solid footing with strong profits and a sustain-
able business model in place. In just that short time, however, the company 
closed 29 plants, eliminated 18,500 jobs, and watched profits shrink from 
$411.5 million in 1997 to just $5.5 million by 1999.
The root of the Levi Strauss implosion was attributed to a massive accu-
mulation of debt incurred in 1985, when it went private in a leveraged  
buyout. Things were further complicated by the derailment of a highly touted 
employee incentive plan that was introduced during the peak year of 1996. 
The idea was to reward employees with a one-time bonus that would be 
equal to one-year’s pay. The cost was $750 million.3
Compounding the company’s difficulties was the altered competitive 
­landscape. Levi’s products were positioned above low-end alternatives sold by 
Sears and J.C. Penney. Yet they were below newer upscale brands produced 
by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Describing the conundrum facing Levi’s,

of California, Berkeley, told the Los Angeles Times, “They’ve allowed the brand 
image to become something that’s not relevant anymore. The worst thing you 
can do is to get caught in the middle.”4
A 2003 article in the Houston Chronicle said of Levi Strauss, “Revenues have 
been falling for the last six years, and pressure is mounting for the company to 
produce results or risk becoming a statistic in another American institution—
bankruptcy.”5 David Bergen, Levi’s vice president, stated that the company was 
caught “in the jaws of death.”6 Finally, that same year, Levi Strauss relented and 
made a deal with Walmart. After years of resisting, the company felt as if it had 
no other choice but to throw its lot in with the giant retailer. The potential 
upside, of course, was the increase in volume that was sure to follow. Kurt 
Barnard, publisher of the Retail Forecasting newsletter, said,
The company has been in grave, grave danger for five or six years, 
and they finally did the one thing—which, I believe, spells survival. 
That was the deal with Walmart. . . . Where else do you get access to  
100 million new customers? The exposure is absolutely unparalleled.7
Harry Bernard, an executive at the retail-consulting firm Colton Bernard, 
summed it up, “They’ll get the volume they need to survive.”8 Levi’s launched 
its Signature line of jeans at Walmart on July 22, 2003, and by December 
jeans were also placed in Target stores. The Signature line did not have Levi’s 
traditional insignias—the distinctive Red Tab, Two Horse leather patch, or 
stitching on the pocket. The jeans retailed for $23 with a rollback price of 
around $19.50.9
Given that the average off-brand price of jeans at Walmart was around $15, 
the Signature line was a premium product for the discount market segment. 
Levi Strauss hoped that the scaled-down product, along with the absence of 
the Red Tab, would adequately differentiate Signature from Levi’s core prod-
ucts. Levi president and chief executive officer Phil Marineau acknowledged 
the concern of the company’s traditional retail customers when he said that 
they were “worried about cannibalization of Levi’s core product, particularly 
from Signature” and, as a result, was “managing Levi’s and Dockers’ orders and 
inventory very conservatively.”10

Levi Strauss & Co. completely reengineered its supply chain to fulfill the needs 
of Walmart. The company was forced to adopt sophisticated forecasting and 
product-tracking technologies. Using a “dashboard” that sits on the desks of 
executives, managers could track a specific product from the factory, to the 
distribution center, to the individual store. Said one Levi’s executive, “When 
I first got here, I didn’t see anything. . . . Now I can drill down to the product 
level.”11 Levi Strauss also expanded its distribution, adding three “pool points” 
that facilitated product dispersal to Walmart distribution centers and super-
centers. In addition, the firm implemented technology to facilitate electronic 
data interchange, as well as other collaborative communication software.  
A cross-functional team was put together to ensure that those logistics efforts 
worked properly.
Levi’s presence at Walmart gave a big boost to the Mega’s efforts to bring 
name brands into the store. “They do like the name,” said consultant Walter 
Loeb.12 “They like to be able to say they carry the Levi’s brand because it gives 
credibility to their business.”13 Still, Levi’s Signature brand had a sluggish start. 
Walmart complained that the inventory turn was slower than anticipated. 
After three months, the disgruntled Mega slashed the price of men’s jeans 
from $23 to $19.14
In 2003, Signature represented 8 percent of all Levi’s sales in the United States 
and 6 percent worldwide. In 2004 it jumped to 14.5 percent and 9.7 percent. 
Walmart executives were pleased with the results. Levi’s, now positioned as a 
mass-market premium brand, represented the high end of the retailer’s denim 
offerings. Walmart also sold Wrangler jeans for $15–$18, and its own private-
label jeans for $9.99. The Levi’s cachet helped to pull people into the stacks of 
denim produced by the three different companies.15 By 2006, it was Dockers, 
not Signature, that was the bright spot for Levi Strauss & Co. This was ironic, 
given previous attempts to jettison this line.16

At the beginning of 2006, Walmart decided to use shelf space in its apparel 
section for its own proprietary brands. Never mind that Levi’s had to recon-
figure its entire supply chain to create a new brand for Walmart. Levi’s 2006 
filing with the SEC stated the following: 
Our ability to maintain retail floor space, market share, and sales 
in these channels depends on our ability to offer differentiated 
and exclusive products and to increase retailer profitability on our 
products, which could have an adverse impact on our margins. In 
addition, recent efforts by mass channel retailers in the United 
States to expand their private label offerings may reduce floor space 
devoted to our Levi Strauss Signature products, which can have an 
adverse impact on our sales. For example, we experienced such 
impacts in 2006 as a result of actions taken by Walmart to increase 
its private-label women’s business.17
The Signature brand was not doing well. The company stopped selling the 
products in Europe because of the insufficiency of mass-market channels.  
The 2007 Annual Financial Report of Levi Strauss stated:
The Signature brand by Levi Strauss and Company had a difficult 
year, as expected. The brand is being overhauled to align with our 
mass retail customer’s evolving apparel merchandising strategies. 
The plans we have developed with them will give the brand a fresh 
look and a new presence at retail for fall 2008.18
Third-quarter results for 2008 were revealing: “Higher net revenues reflected 
growth in each of the company’s three regions. The increase in net revenues 
was primarily driven by currency, the addition of brand-dedicated retail stores 
worldwide, and sales growth at existing stores.”19 In their corporate filing 
for 2009, Levi Strauss stated that it might not be able to increase sales for 
the mass market because of private-label competition and because, in the 
mass-market channel, there was a reduction “in fixture spaces and purchases 
of brands that do not meet their mass-market requirements.”20 Ironically, it 
had been the mass market that was supposed to save the company. During 
the years that ensued, the situation only got worse. The 2013 annual report

noted that its Signature brand, along with the newer Denizen brand, which 
was introduced into Target stores in 2011, accounted for less than 4 percent 
of net sales. An article in The Irish Times summarized the strategic miscalcula-
tion that tipped Levi Strauss off its perch: 
Up until the mid-1990s Levi’s jeans were seen as an essential fashion 
item. But then the industry underwent a seismic shift, as denim came 
to be seen as a luxury item with brands such as 7 for All Mankind 
and True Religion selling their jeans for up to six times what a pair 
of Levi’s cost and distributing them through luxury boutiques and 
department stores. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon, Levi’s 
failed to respond to changing consumer tastes and suffered. It clung 
firmly to its position as a midprice manufacturer, despite the fact that 
the denim business was becoming polarized between the luxury and 
the discount end. In fact, Levi’s did not introduce its own premium 
denim line—Capital E—until 2006, long after the luxury trend had 
first emerged.
Chip Bergh, who became CEO in 2011, had this to say about the predicament 
of Levi Strauss: 
We are working to make Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.) great, again. 
Our aspiration is to be and be seen as the world’s best apparel 
company and one of the best-performing companies in any industry. 
It’s an ambitious goal, but it wasn’t too long ago that this company 
held that spot, and I believe we can reclaim it.21
Mega-Customers often demonstrate a phenomenal ability to dominate  
businesses and transform entire industries. Unfortunately, this domination 
and transformation has left many of America’s producers in subservient 
positions, weakened relative to large-scale Mega-Customers. Like Levi Strauss, 
the story of Goodyear illustrates the diminishing aura of once-dominant 
brands, overwhelmed as they are by the shadows cast by Mega-Customers in 
so many sectors of the economy.
Goodyear: The Rubber Hits the Parking Lot
Perhaps no other company is as emblematic of American industrial might as 
the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. With ubiquitous dealerships, highly 
visible blimps, and widely respected products and brands, Goodyear domi-
nated the tire market for most of the 20th century. It is difficult to fathom 
that this icon of American manufacturing has been undone in recent years 
21Levi Strauss & Co., “2013 Annual Report: Forging the Path of Progress,” p. 3.

21
by its negligent embrace of the Megas—a negligence including the rejection 
of decades of carefully nurturing, maintaining, and expanding one of the most 
successful dealer networks in American business history.
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the pioneer US tire company and 
the industry leader for nearly 100 years, pushed itself into the hands of the 
Mega-Customers in the mid-1990s. For years, the firm cautiously managed an 
extensive and effective sales network, consisting of more than 5,000 autho-
rized dealers. Then, in the mid-1990s, as part of a reorganization effort, the 
company abandoned its dealers and began to sell through Sears, Walmart, and 
Montgomery Ward.
Predictably, the dealers did not take this sitting down and instead linked their for-
tunes to other brands, such as Michelin and Pirelli. As a result, Goodyear began 
to lose a global network of faithful, committed dealers, and ended up selling a 
product perceived by consumers as just another tire sold at discount stores.
Bob Davis, a former Goodyear dealer in New Hampshire, stated, “You’d buy a 
tire from them one month; in the next month the price would be 20 percent 
lower or higher. . . . It was just too hard to do business with Goodyear.”22
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company was founded in 1898, when Frank 
A. Seiberling borrowed $3,500 to buy a former strawboard factory in Akron, 
Ohio. Named after Charles Goodyear, the inventor of the rubber vulcaniza-
tion process, the firm grew to 30,000 employees and had a pre-depression 
production high of 837,000 tires in April 1920. By 1930, despite depression-
era challenges, the company had sales of $250 million and operations in 145 
countries.23 Goodyear’s contemporary use of mass distributors was presaged 
during the early years when it entered into a distribution agreement with 
Sears, Roebuck & Company. The deal was simple: Goodyear charged Sears for 
the cost of producing tires plus a profit margin of 6 percent.
In what was to become a famous antitrust case, the tire maker was accused 
in 1936 of violating the Clayton Act, an antitrust law enacted in 1914. Unlike 
the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was concerned with attempts to monopo-
lize commerce, the Clayton Act focused on practices deemed to interfere 
with fair competition. Section 2 of the act stated, “It shall be unlawful for 
any person engaged in interstate commerce to discriminate in price between 
­different purchasers . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be to 
­substantially lessen competition or to create a monopoly in an area of inter-
state commerce.”24

22
In 1936, the Federal Trade Commission issued an order forcing the tire 
company to end its arrangement with Sears. Although Goodyear appealed, 
it decided to terminate the relationship with the retailer. The laws and 
­regulations passed at this time, which reflected government efforts to deal 
with the ravages of the Great Depression through statist policies, had at best, 
ambiguous economic outcomes.25 But government meddling did have one 
unambiguous result for Goodyear: the company’s use of mass-market distrib-
utors would not be revived until the 1980s, when it once again began selling 
its tires through Sears. Ironically, the appeal that the tire company filed came 
out in its favor in 1939.
The failure of the Sears deal meant that Goodyear had to develop its own 
marketing channels. As a result, the tire maker spent decades in control of its 
own sales and distribution. At its peak in the 1980s, the firm operated more 
than 1,000 company-owned stores, which produced 27 percent of sales; 600 
franchised dealers that generated 23 percent of sales; and 4,400 independent 
dealers that produced 50 percent of sales. Franchisee dealers were simply 
new Goodyear dealers that graduated to independent status after completing 
three years of training by the company in the areas of business, finance, and 
operations.
Goodyear built its multimillion-dollar enterprise by creating the most effec-
tive dealership network in the United States. For most of its history, a dealer 
sold only Goodyear tires. The agreement went something like this: “You sell 
only Goodyear tires, and we’ll take care of you. As long as your performance 
is satisfactory, we will provide you with an exclusive sales territory. If you 
are the Goodyear dealer in North Platte, Nebraska, we will sell tires only 
through you. If your performance is off, we’ll talk to you about how to fix 
things before we open either a company-owned store or a separate dealer-
ship.” In 1989, 70 percent of the dealers sold only Goodyear tires.
However, by 1991, the number had dropped to 50 percent. The other brands 
carried by dealers were typically lower-priced alternatives. Still, the Goodyear 
tire network was so loyal to the company that when the British financier 
James Goldsmith attempted a hostile takeover in 1986, the dealers were 
his most vocal opponents. The company was able to beat off the takeover 
attempt due to the combined efforts of the dealers and the citizenry of Akron, 
where Goodyear is headquartered. Several Goodyear blimps literally buzzed 
the city like bombers on the lookout for invaders. The high debt load resulting

23
from the battle with Goldsmith was used as the reason behind Goodyear’s  
decision to begin selling to Sears in 1992. This decision was followed by deals 
with Walmart and Sam’s Club.26
In June 1991, Stan Gault, the former CEO of Rubbermaid and a Goodyear 
board member, took over the battered tire giant. Gault had experienced  
fabulous career success. Touted as a miracle man on Wall Street, he was 
popular in the investment community because of his career history. During 
his 11 years at Rubbermaid, the company had quadrupled in size with earn-
ings growing sixfold. “He was a real tough cookie when it comes to costs,” a 
former associate reported.27
Sears had been attempting to get Goodyear to supply them with tires  
since 1989. Concern about the dealer network forestalled action until the 
Gault ascendancy. With his marketing background and previous experience 
­selling through Mega-Customers, Gault provided about 20 percent of Sears’ 
tire inventory almost overnight. To emphasize the newly adopted mass-market 
approach, he personally sold a set of ties to a pilot while flying to Chicago to 
join Sears executives for a press conference announcing the agreement. The 
next deal was with Walmart, which began selling a line called Viva in 1994.28 
Discounter Montgomery Ward followed, with the latter selling two exclusive 
tire lines. Gault stated at the time that the arrangement with Montgomery 
Ward was an attempt to expand distribution to new customers.29
The company implemented a number of cost-cutting measures and strategic 
initiatives, but the decision to begin selling tires on the mass market was the one 
with the most far-reaching consequences. Abandonment of the dealers did not 
come about as the result of analysis, executive discussions, or boardroom debate. 
Rather, the decision was simply made in the immediate aftermath of the decision 
to supply Sears. Goodyear’s market share increased to 16 ­percent, reflecting the 
inventory buildup at Sears. Initially, dealers responded to Goodyear’s embrace 
of the mass-market with despair. One dealer said, “We went with them through 
thick and thin and now they’re going to drown us.”30

24
Not only did the dealers now have to contend with new competitors, but the 
high-velocity, lower-priced approach of the Megas meant that they also had to 
lower their prices, resulting in lower margins for everyone.31 The dealers did 
not sit idly by as the rug was pulled out from under them. According to Manny 
Dracakis, former Goodyear dealer and the owner of All American Tire and 
Service in Cincinnati, “After someone punches you in the face a few times, you 
say enough is enough.”32
With the delicate relationship between Goodyear and its dealer network 
violated, the dealers soon found other suitors. Instead of selling Goodyear 
tires exclusively, they began to carry multiple brands. Pam Fitzgerald, the vice 
president of a large dealership in Florida, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal 
as saying, “We will sell what we think will give the customer the best value, and 
that’s no longer necessarily Goodyear.”33 The adoption of new brands by this 
dealership reduced the sales of Goodyear tires by 20 percent.
For its part, Sears used Goodyear tires as an inducement to attract customers,  
but then pushed its own store brand, RoadHandler, as well as other private 
labels.
In 2000, Nashville-based Bridgestone Americas’ tire operations recalled  
millions of original equipment and replacement tires that had been identified as 
potentially unsafe by the National Transportation Safety Board. It appeared as if 
the very survival of the company was at stake. Yet two years later, Bridgestone 
reported a $135 million operating profit due to the increased sales of both 
Bridgestone/Firestone tires. During the same time, Goodyear suffered a  
12 percent decline in North American sales and a dramatic drop in operat-
ing earnings, from $80 million down to only $10 million. According to an 
editorial in the industry journal Tire Business, the divergence in fortunes was 
attributable to the difference in how the companies had managed their dealer 
networks. Bridgestone, and its predecessor Firestone, worked hard to cre-
ate a loyal dealer network, so that when the bad times came, the dealers 
would stick with the company. In contrast, Goodyear dealers felt they had

been stiffed by the manufacturer and, as a result, felt no loyalty. The editorial 
went on to say this:
Many Goodyear dealers are angry with the company and don’t feel 
the loyalty they once did to the tire maker. But there is no reason 
why Goodyear, which once enjoyed a dealer following second to 
none, can’t regain that loyalty. It must again make independent 
dealers its number one priority. Ever since the Akron-based tire 
maker began years ago to expand sales and distribution beyond its 
own company stores and independent dealers, it has been losing 
momentum. Goodyear’s independent tire dealers are one of the tire 
company’s greatest assets. They stand on the front lines and more 
often than not determine what the retail tire customer buys. They 
can help reenergize the company. The sooner Goodyear recognizes 
this, the better.”34
Despite the recommendations of industry observers, Goodyear continued to 
push product to its Mega-Customers. By 2003, it had lost control of its sales 
and distribution and was offering what was widely perceived to be a commod-
ity product for the mass market. The new CEO, who replaced Gault, promised 
to make up with the dealers. That is something that has yet to happen.
What about the other tire manufacturers? Did they fall prey to the Customer 
Trap? Bridgestone still has a loyal dealer network. Michelin works closely 
with dealers and also sells on the mass market, but because their tires are  
positioned as premium products in the marketplace, Mega-Customers are less 
able to squeeze them on margins. Research undertaken by Michelin indicates 
that the customers who buy either Michelin or BFGoodrich brands spend 
an average of $388 when purchasing tires. That is 30 percent more than the  
average spent on other brands.35
And what of the tire dealers? During the years since Goodyear ditched its 
dealer network, the tire retail business has gone through a massive indus-
try consolidation, with the top 100 tire dealerships operating an average of 
58 stores while carrying more than 10 brands.36 With connection between 
manufacturer and loyal dealer severed by Goodyear, many independent 
dealers have reaped big benefits with the new arrangement.

Chapter 2 | The Customer Trap and Brand Destruction

By 2001, Goodyear was in the red and has stayed there for most of the last 
14 years. During this time, it has had one of the worst-performing stocks on 
the Standard & Poor’s Financial Services S&P 500 index. While many factors 
contributed to the breakdown of the company, the jettisoning of a loyal distri-
bution network surely played a large role. Goodyear lost control of its sales 
and distribution and will likely never recover.37
The stories of Levi Strauss and Goodyear demonstrate the peril companies 
face when they abrogate control over the distribution of their products to 
outside forces. Rather than dirtying their hands with dusty notions of sales 
and distribution, companies often think that they can innovate their way 
to success while leaving to others the tawdry details of bringing products 
into the marketplace. In the next chapter, we’ll explore the limits of such an 
approach.

Turning Your 
Innovations into 
Commodities
Control your destiny, or somebody else will.
—Anonymous
Management gurus, consultants, the business press, politicians, educators, and 
so many others are hell-bent on getting as many people as possible to buy 
into the idea that innovation is the answer. At one level, such passion makes 
a lot of sense. For capitalism to f lourish, growth is needed. Growth is fueled 
by new processes, products, and services, which challenge the status quo. 
Theoretically, this is all good: the economy expands, and innovative companies 
thrive. Competition forces the laggards to catch up or they go out of business. 
And the cycle starts anew.
However, in reality, something must be amiss when more than 75 percent of 
new ideas and inventions fail to gain traction in the marketplace. It seems that 
with so much attention focused squarely on creation, a critical component of 
the innovation formula is lost. That is, who is this innovation for?
In our experience, companies far too often assume that their amazing  
new inventions will almost metaphysically end up in the hands of the right 
customers—customers who will appreciate and value the innovation almost 
as much as they do. But what if those customers don’t really care about the 
unique contribution the product makes to the marketplace, but are concerned

only about extracting price concessions in order to build market share? In 
other words, how is an innovation out there sold to existing customers who 
only want to render it into a commodity that they can capture, control, and 
then discard at will?
Innovation has been all the rage in popular and academic circles for a long 
time. Recently, educators have been developing and implementing curricula 
that emphasize science and math for the purpose of keeping the United States 
at the top of the innovation ladder. At universities, new master of business 
administration (MBA) programs and executive education courses focused on 
integrating innovation within the corporate culture are incredibly popular. 
Companies of all sizes have introduced innovation departments or divisions. 
The position of chief innovation officer (CIO) has become an increasingly 
fashionable job title. A recent search on the Monster web site revealed 19,000 
management positions with the word “innovation” in the title. Technology 
transfer is sold as the link between academia and the private sector. Best-
selling books by management gurus are in lockstep agreement that innovation 
is the hope for most companies as firms seek to avoid commoditization and 
stay ahead of the competition.
The conventional wisdom holds that innovation is essential for many companies 
that seek sustainable competitive advantage. The argument is that globalization, 
homogeneous markets, hypercompetition, and lower costs can rapidly turn 
many innovative products and services into commodities, thereby disallowing 
companies time to recoup the cost of bringing the innovation to market. In 
response, innovation is pushed from all corners as the best way for companies 
to stay ahead of the competition and deliver high value to customers. However, 
the practice of innovation often comes up short.
The problem is not a lack of innovative ideas (277,835 patents for inventions 
were granted in the United States in 2013), nor is it spending on R&D. After 
the 2008 recession, it took only a few years for R&D to rebound, with the 
pace of growth exceeding gross domestic product in 2011 and 2012, just as 
it had in the eight years preceding the economic downturn.1 For many busi-
ness leaders, innovation is viewed as the best way to ensure growth once 
market conditions begin to improve. Examples of companies creating great 
innovations during turbulent economic times include DuPont’s invention of

shatterproof plastic and its creation of nylons, and Kraft Foods’ introduc-
tion of macaroni-and-cheese dinners and formulation of Miracle Whip. These 
products were developed during the Great Depression. During the recession 
of 2001, Apple introduced the iPod.2
Why do so many innovations fail? While there are many possibilities, one 
explanation is that developing an innovation is simply the first step in a two-
step process, and if the second step is missed, all the blood, sweat, tears, and 
money that were poured into the product in the first place are likely to be 
wasted. Dishearteningly, many firms simply do not demonstrate much interest 
in capturing the real value of their innovations, especially as they move into the 
second step—the sale and distribution of their products. Instead of reaping 
rewards for their efforts, companies have allowed Mega-Customers to take 
over the second step, thereby accelerating the process of commoditization.
With the dream of huge sales and a bigger market, innovative firms lose con-
trol as their innovations move out of the laboratory or factory and into the 
marketplace. The misstep of neglecting sales and distribution accelerates the 
path of commoditization for the innovation. Many companies that, at one time, 
built innovative products that could command high prices have abandoned 
this strategy, instead adopting the “volume at all costs” approach. This has 
occurred through a systematic process by which the Megas use their dispro-
portionate size and buying power to disable the strategic imperatives of the 
innovative companies that do business with them.
As discussed earlier, the origins of the current arrangement began several 
decades ago, when business owners and managers lost interest in managing 
sales and distribution in favor of a new managerial paradigm that emphasized 
core competencies (innovation, technology, operational effectiveness, and out-
sourcing). By identifying and exploring their internal capabilities, businesses 
believed they would be able to focus more effectively on creating better inno-
vations for new markets—resulting in significant benefits for customers. It was 
assumed that new innovations produced at a lower cost would be the ultimate 
result for companies that pursued this strategy. By catering to the mass mar-
ket, however, innovative companies have allowed Mega-Customers to capture 
the value of their products and services, even as the Megas imposed costs and 
changes in strategic direction and operational control. Too often, the inno-
vations of producers pass from their ownership and control into a form of 
property held, for all practical purposes, in the hands of the Megas.

Innovations sold by the Megas can create a great deal of brand exposure, the 
influx of numerous customers, and enormous revenue generation. As prod-
ucts become successful and new facilities (and debt) are created to keep up 
with demand, the Mega-Customers insist on greater price reductions and, in 
the end, companies end up working like dogs to keep up with the dictates of 
their “partners”—all the while watching their innovations being treated more 
and more like commodities.
The Example from Detroit 
For decades, Detroit’s Big Three dominated hundreds of small and geographi-
cally isolated car dealerships. Dealers functioned in restricted areas and were 
not allowed to sell competing brands. Beginning in the late 1970s, to boost 
lagging sales, the Big Three grew their number of dealers and permitted exist-
ing ones to sell other brands of automobiles if those brands did not constitute 
direct competition with Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company 
(GM), or Chrysler Group LLC. For example, Ford dealers could sell GMC 
trucks, and Chrysler dealers could sell Pontiacs. Over time, the ability of man-
ufacturers to exert control over their now multibrand dealers began to erode 
because everyone was selling everything. The manufacturers, companies that 
prided themselves on new designs with each model year rollout, did not inter-
vene because they were afraid of losing short-term sales and alienating long-
term customers. The shift of power away from the manufacturer/innovator to 
the dealers was now underway. The inevitable outcome was that, instead of 
an exclusive, dedicated dealer who sold only one line of vehicles, dealerships 
were now able to evolve into superstores, selling multiple brands. The big-
gest auto dealer in the country today is AutoNation, which sells almost every 
brand that is available in the United States.
When Detroit opened up the Pandora’s box of multibrand dealerships, it was 
left with only two potential options that would allow it to regain control over 
distribution. First, it could drop unruly dealers and create a completely new 
sales and distribution network. While straightforward from a business point of 
view, the Big Three were unable to do this because of state laws and regulations 
designed to maintain the manufacturer-dealer agreements. Harvard business 
professor V. Kasturi Rangan summarizes the situation this way:
By the end of the 1980s, dealers had gained a huge degree of independence 
from US manufacturers. Dealers could add imported car brands that 
were, in some cases, stronger than their corresponding US nameplates, 
and dealers had made headway in creating state laws to protect them 
from heavy-handed franchising practices, including the termination of 
dealers. The automakers had significant clout at the federal level, but 
at the state level, the dealers held significant sway. Automobile dealers 

The Customer Trap
31
accounted for only 1 to 2 percent of all retail outlets, but on average, 
they contributed 20 percent of states’ retail revenues and consequently 
3 percent of all state tax revenues.3
In small-town America, car dealerships are often the largest business in a 
given legislative district. State representatives were not interested in allowing 
Detroit to dismantle these local sources of employment and tax revenue.
The second option was to create more dealerships, often near the territories 
of existing dealers. This ultimately led to lower profitability for dealerships as 
they competed with each other for the same market share as well as increased 
costs for Detroit because of the need to supply and support underperforming 
outlets. As multibrand dealerships proliferated, the Big Three thought that the 
solution to their distribution problems might be the emergence of e-commerce 
as a viable channel. However, the political clout of the dealers was not about 
to be bypassed. By May 2000, 33 states had laws prohibiting or restricting 
manufacturers from selling cars online.4
The third option for manufacturers was to learn to get along with the new 
power structure and see their innovative products become commoditized 
year after year. Detroit had to retain its existing dealer network, and logi-
cally, the evolution of multibrand dealers continued because firms such as 
AutoNation were able to sell an array of models from different manufacturers. 
For AutoNation, a Mega-distributor that represents multiple manufacturers in 
many states, the only brand that matters is the one serving its purposes at a 
particular moment. Because dealers such as AutoNation manage a portfolio of 
brands, they are able to quickly adapt and respond to changes in the market-
place. If there is a new model change at Ford that the buying public does not 
like, or if Ford’s innovations are good but not as good as their competitors, 
AutoNation can seamlessly shift to selling more-popular Chevrolets, Dodges, 
Hyundais, or Kias. Their customers will still buy, revenues will still come into 
the Mega-distributor, and the dealership will continue to grow.
Ganley Auto Group is the largest auto dealer in Ohio and one of the top 
ten in the entire United States. The brands the company sells include BMW, 
Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Subaru, Scion, Suzuki, Toyota, 
Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Jeep, Lincoln, and Mercury.5 Is 
Ganley married to any one brand? No way. The only brand that matters to 
Ganley is the one that is serving its needs at any particular moment. Ganley 
can seamlessly shift to selling “better” brands and models at any point.

Ford has spent billions of dollars catching up with the technological lead of 
Toyota and Nissan. But what happens when the buying public is not excited 
about Ford products? What can it do? Ford produces and sells only Ford-
brand automobiles and trucks. The company has borne most, if not all, of the 
risk—it has dealt with the lawyers and government safety inspectors, spent 
tens of millions of dollars on market research, sourced new parts from sup-
pliers, and retooled its manufacturing processes—to bring innovative new 
products to market. All of this was done in the name of innovation, but 
because Ford can barely influence its biggest customers such as AutoNation 
in any meaningful way, it is always under the gun to cut costs, pressure  
suppliers, and when necessary, send jobs offshore. US automakers average a 
net of 5 percent on sales, with profitability ranging from –2.5 to 10 percent.6 
For example, in the third quarter of 2014, Chrysler reported net income 
of $611 million on $20.7 billion in sales and a modified operating profit of  
8.7 percent of $946 million.7
Only after government bailouts and bankruptcy proceedings were automakers  
able to gain some control over the sale of their products. In the spring of 
2009, with assurances from bankruptcy courts and government bodies, each 
company cut out nearly 1,000 dealers from its network.
Rubbermaid Abrogates Control 
Another example of a company falling into the Customer Trap is Rubbermaid. 
For years, this firm was admired because it produced a wide range of high-
quality storage and related products. The company was directly plugged into 
customer needs like few other consumer product companies. Ellen Spong, a 
stay-at-home mom from Canton, Ohio, said, “I remember when Rubbermaid 
called and asked to spend some time in my house. Two researchers spent 
the afternoon in the kids’ bedroom, looking at how things were packed into 
the closets and asking questions about possible solutions to all of the kids’ 
stuff.”8 Such attention to understanding how people might use Rubbermaid’s 
products created an industry with a name brand that was admired and 
respected throughout America. However, by 2008, the company, which had 
been acquired by Newell ten years before, was firmly ensconced in the com-
modity business.

The Customer Trap

Rubbermaid got its start in 1933, when James R. Caldwell and his wife invented 
29 products based on deficiencies they experienced in their own kitchen. 
Caldwell “rang 10 doorbells and sold nine dustpans.” Buoyed by his success, 
he was soon making use of department stores to market soap dishes, sink 
plugs, and drain board mats throughout New England. The new firm merged 
with Wooster Rubber Company, a struggling Ohio enterprise that had formed 
in 1920. Wooster Rubber Company, with only $80,000 in sales in 1935, was 
rejuvenated by the merger, and in 1941, the newly constituted Rubbermaid 
had sales of $450,000. By this time, Caldwell had succeeded in marketing  
27 of the 29 products he and his wife had envisioned.9
Like many businesses during World War II, Rubbermaid switched from producing  
consumer products to contributing items needed for the war effort. After the 
war, the company introduced automotive accessories, such as rubber floor 
mats and cup holders, as well as its previous line of products. But it was not 
until 1955 that the business began to make products out of plastic, with the 
introduction of a plastic dishpan in 1956. Soon Rubbermaid marketed indus-
trial and commercial items to restaurants, hotels, and other businesses.
Caldwell retired in the late 1950s. The next major leader of Rubbermaid was 
Donald E. Noble, a man of amazing vision and managerial abilities. Noble arranged 
for company stock to be sold on the New York Stock Exchange, pushed for a 
goal of doubling earnings on a six-year basis (which he was able to pull off ), and 
based the firm’s future on its ability to innovate. Product development was the 
key to this new effort. By 1968, the goal was to have 30 percent of annual sales 
originate from products introduced in the five previous years.
Like many companies in the 1970s, Rubbermaid began to get into unrelated 
businesses. It unsuccessfully marketed recreational goods such as snow 
sleds and motorboats. “We bombed,” the vice president of marketing said 
to a reporter at The Wall Street Journal at the time. Other troubles followed, 
including problems with the Federal Trade Commission in the 1970s.
Donald Noble retired in 1980. He was replaced by none other than Stan Gault, 
who would later go on to lead Goodyear into the Customer Trap during the 
1990s. Gault cut his teeth at General Electric (GE), where he had been in charge 
of the appliance division. A Wooster native, he made his way through college by 
working at Rubbermaid during the summers. Gault set out to quadruple sales 
by 1990, and he acted quickly. Operations were streamlined. Factories in the 
Netherlands were closed, the party-plan business (similar to Tupperware) was 
abandoned, and the automotive division was sold. Eleven percent of manage-
ment was fired, and half of the company’s middle-management positions were 
eliminated. Gault brought in people from GE to fill the top spots in the firm.

A period of aggressive acquisition followed, which included the purchase 
of MicroComputer Accessories, a computer accessory company, and the 
Gott Corporation, a producer of insulated coolers and beverage holders. 
Rubbermaid also entered into joint ventures with Allibert, a producer of out-
door furniture, and DSM N.V., a Dutch chemical manufacturer. In 1989, sales 
stood at $1.45 billion, four times what they were in 1981 ($350 million).10 
Gault had exceeded his initial goal of quadrupling sales. How did he do this? 
Two major factors contributed to Rubbermaid’s astonishing growth—acquisitions 
and innovations. The most noteworthy of these was the acquisition of Little 
Tikes Company.
Little Tikes
Little Tikes was an innovative company par excellence. In 1970, Thomas G. 
Murdough was unhappy with what he perceived to be the cheap and poorly 
made toys that flooded the market during the decade. In response, he founded 
the Little Tikes Company, based on a technology called rotational mold-
ing, which was used to produce large agricultural and chemical containers. 
Murdough found that molded plastic toys made using this methodology were 
more durable than the products then on the market.
The firm used its technology to invent outdoor play equipment in many styles 
using a large variety of shapes. The rotational molding process facilitated the 
creation of large surface areas that were durable and had comparatively few 
parts. As impressive as Murdough’s product and process innovations were, his 
understanding of sales and distribution was even more remarkable.
Murdough believed that he could avoid the deep discounting and low product 
quality of other toy manufacturers by keeping tight control over distribution. 
During the 1960s, the strategy of large retailers, such as Kmart, was to draw 
parents into their stores by marketing the most popular toys as loss leaders. 
As a result, smaller stores were forced to lower their own prices and suffer 
from low profit margins. These small stores then put pressure on wholesal-
ers, who pushed manufacturers to lower their own prices. The manufacturers 
managed to do this by compromising on quality. Younger baby boomers can 
attest to the steady decline in toy quality that occurred during the late 1960s 
through the 1970s. Compare what this generation says about toys with those 
who went to grade school in the 1950s.

NY: Wiley and Sons, 2007), p. 49.

The Customer Trap
35
Murdough was not drawn into the downward quality spiral because he simply 
refused to do business with large discounters. Instead, he focused on manu-
facturing innovative products, creating word-of-mouth “buzz” among parents, 
and building an effective network of independent distributors. The strategy  
of innovation, in concert with control over sales and distribution, was a phe-
nomenal success.
Murdough sold his company to Rubbermaid for $50 million in 1984, stayed on 
as president for five years, and then resigned in frustration. He quit because 
Rubbermaid officials placed unrelenting pressure on him to distribute Little 
Tikes products through Kmart and Ames. Murdough objected, arguing that 
heavy promotion in the mass market could lead to short product life cycles. 
“You saturate the marketplace. . . . That’s a big part of the reason the toy 
industry is flat on its back.”11
Murdough wanted to “eliminate overkill distribution.” A history of Little Tikes 
describes what happened:  “Mr. Gault resisted, Mr. Murdough says, partly because 
these same mass merchants devote considerable shelf space to Rubbermaid’s 
vast line of houseware products. ’Rubbermaid wants to distribute to every 
nook and cranny,’ he [Murdough] says. A decade later, Murdough told Forbes, 
’It turns out we never needed Rubbermaid’s money. . . . I was spending all my 
time just keeping them [Rubbermaid executives] out of my hair.’”12
With Murdough’s departure, Gault predicted that Little Tikes would have “its 
best year ever.”13 Little Tikes began innovating for the mass market. Five addi-
tional manufacturing plants were opened, a new 6,000-square-foot customer 
service center was built, and the firm unfurled new distribution agreements 
with customers including Kmart, Toys “R” Us, and Walmart.
The Acceleration of Commoditization
Rubbermaid had a great reputation. For 14 years, it was ranked number one 
in its industry group by Fortune, which also named Rubbermaid America’s 
Most Admired Company in 1993. Wolfgang Schmitt took over the business 
two years after Stan Gault retired in 1991. To say that Schmitt, who had 
worked for the company since 1966, was proud of Rubbermaid would be 
a gross understatement. An essay by Schmitt in a popular 1990s business 
book brims with displays of self-assurance, hubris, and confidence regarding

36
the company’s course. Consider the following quotes from the former chief 
executive officer:
“Our brands continue to prevail because of our persis-
• 
tent, consistently clever product innovation.”14
“Each of our products reflects several generations of inno-
• 
vation, and innovation is what distinguishes Rubbermaid 
from a sea of competitors.”15
“Whatever turns out to be our next breakthrough, I can 
• 
guarantee that it will reflect changing trends, providing a 
one-to-one solution for the consumer.”16
At its peak, Rubbermaid offered 5,000 different items, producing nearly 400 
new products each year. A puff piece in Fortune, in 1994, credited the firm’s 
creativity to Schmitt’s uncanny abilities—he is “thinking, always thinking”17—as 
well as 21 development teams consisting of people from marketing, finance, 
manufacturing, R&D, and sales. The result of these efforts was the creation 
of some truly impressive products, from the heat-resistant spatula (one of 
Schmitt’s ideas) to the Hip-Hugger laundry basket.
The Dye is Cast
In addition to Schmitt’s passion for innovation, the company was equally com-
mitted to continuing Gault’s strategy of selling through the Megas. Explaining 
the role of the mass discounters to Rubbermaid’s future, Schmitt said, “It’s 
typically the bigger suppliers that can form the sort of close partnerships that 
retailing’s behemoths are increasingly demanding. The goal is to boost sales 
and reduce costs for both sides by slashing inventories, shortening lead times, 
and eliminating error: There is a healthy independence between us and people 
like Walmart. We need them; they need us.”18
The new decade proved to be disastrous for Rubbermaid. As its commit-
ment to the mass marketers increased, so too did the demands by Mega-
Customers for lower prices. At first, Rubbermaid treated pressure from the

big-box stores with scorn. For years, it had been able to easily pass along price 
increases to its distributors, who simply charged customers more. However, 
expectations were rapidly changing.
The ubiquity of Walmart, The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and other potential Mega-
Customers, coupled with an inflation rate that hung around 2 or 3 percent for 
most of the decade, had created an expectation that prices would rise only 
slowly, if at all. Walmart accounted for about 14 percent of Rubbermaid’s busi-
ness when, in 1994, disaster struck.
The key component of Rubbermaid’s products is polymer-based resins, which 
make up about one-third of the cost of any given item. The price of res-
ins had been stable for years, but in spring 1994, costs shot up because of 
new global demand and a supply shortage resulting from problems at key 
refineries. Within 18 months, the price of resins nearly doubled, adding $200 
million to Rubbermaid’s costs.19 Focused as always on earnings growth, the 
company increased its prices by what Schmitt claimed averaged, at the most, 
six percent.20 Rubbermaid’s price increases were met with derision by the 
Megas. The giant retailers objected to monthly price increases and com-
plained that Rubbermaid was unresponsive to the realities of the market. 
Competitor products were available. Sterilite, a privately held company based 
in Massachusetts, and Tucker Housewares, a division of Mobil Oil, were ready 
to fill shelf space at Walmart with much cheaper items. The Megas were ready 
to jettison Rubbermaid. The problem was termed the “premium gap.”
“We let the premium gap get too big in the early Nineties,” Schmitt told 
Fortune magazine.21 The article explained the dilemma this way:
An experienced householder knows that she should have to pay 
no more than $10 for a reliable 32-gallon garbage can. When she 
spots an $8.99 Rubbermaid can next to a competitor’s $5 can, 
Rubbermaid is not concerned. ’It’s probably thin and breakable, and 
the customer knows that,’ says Schmitt. What worries Rubbermaid 
is a competitor’s $7.99 can, because it’s probably pretty good. Yet 
the price is low enough to fall below the 10 percent premium gap. 
Thus, Rubbermaid not only loses a sale but may also have convinced 
the shopper that it is overcharging.22

Initially, Schmitt thought that Rubbermaid would be able to weather the resin-
based price increase better than its competitors. However, Tucker avoided 
the resin problem with product designs based on recycled plastics and cedar 
inserts for storage bins and trash cans. Sterilite was a privately held company 
that did not share Rubbermaid’s aggressive profit goals and was not under the 
same kind of profit pressure brought to bear by Wall Street.23
As the company’s innovations became increasingly commoditized, Schmitt 
attempted to lower costs and increase sales to offset the loss of value. But it 
was too late. The pressure to create innovative products had often resulted 
in superficial, cosmetic changes that “created manufacturing complexity and 
retail confusion” and that resulted in no increase in sales.24
Their Mega-Customers demonstrated only scorn for Rubbermaid, and they 
reacted with glee as the former wonder company began its downward slide. Said 
a Kmart official, “Retailers warned Rubbermaid, ’You will kill your business if 
you don’t do something about your prices.’”25 Another said, “They’ve been such 
lousy shippers. Not on time, terrible fill rates, and their products cost too much. 
They show you a new product line and then tell you they can ship only a third of 
what you want.”26 Walmart, frustrated with the price increases, emptied shelves 
of Rubbermaid’s Little Tikes, and turned the space over to Fisher Price.27
Left with no other real option, Rubbermaid felt compelled to change gears. 
In 1994, it began to compete aggressively on the basis of price, offering steep 
discounts to its Mega-Customers. Its margins quickly eroded, and cost-cutting 
measures were enacted, including the elimination of 1,170 jobs and the closure 
of nine plants. The company purged 6,000 color and size variations and cut the 
total number of products by 45 percent.28 These efforts produced only tempo-
rary relief. Rubbermaid was acquired by Newell in 1998 for $6 billion in stock.
And what of Little Tikes? The problems that afflicted Rubbermaid in the 
1990s—slowing demand and high material costs—also challenged Little Tikes. 
The firm responded with increased R&D, new product displays, and more 
product launches. When Newell bought out Rubbermaid, Little Tikes began to 
invest heavily in consumer research, resulting in original products designed to 
stimulate the imagination of children. The firm also used innovative weather-
resistant technology to produce electronic toys that could be left outside.

The Customer Trap
39
Little Tikes was tenacious in its attempts to innovate its way around challenges 
posed by its competitors, distributors, and new owners.
Despite these efforts, sales continued to slide. In 2001, Toys “R” Us, its largest 
distributor, began cutting back its Little Tikes inventory to increase sales per 
square foot. In 2005, Little Tikes generated sales of $250 million—$20 million 
less than in 1989. Ultimately, the Little Tikes name came to be associated with 
deeply discounted toys sold on the mass market. In 2006, Newell Rubbermaid 
sold Little Tikes to MGA Entertainment.
Innovation may be necessary, but it is clearly not enough. This becomes 
crystal clear in the case of Amazon.com, which in many ways has perfected 
the Customer Trap.
Perfecting the Customer Trap
To those of us on the outside, Amazon was a bit of an enigma until Brad 
Stone’s book, The Everything Store, pulled open the door and let observers 
see how its founder, Jeff Bezos, organized the shelves and dealt with the mer-
chandise. Bezos, a man of incredible vision, drive, and ambition, may be a true 
business genius. One thing is for sure: he viscerally understands the Customer 
Trap. Bezos is the world’s foremost expert on how to make it work.
Bezos understood the power of scale from the earliest days of Amazon.com. 
In 1996, during one of their occasional walks around downtown Seattle, Bezos 
explained to his colleague Shel Kaphan why he was determined to rapidly 
expand Amazon. “When you are small, someone else that is bigger can always 
come along and take away what you have. We have to level the playing field in 
terms of purchasing power with the established booksellers.”29
This intuition became policy in 1998, when in his first letter to shareholders, 
Bezos explained that Amazon would measure its success not by profitability, 
but by market leadership, defined as growing its market share. The letter, which 
became “holy scripture” inside the company and is re-released each year with 
the annual report, shapes the company’s strategy up to the present day:
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the 
shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a 
direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market 
leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more 
powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate 
directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, 
and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.
29Brad Stone,  The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon (New York, NY: Little, 
Brown and Company, 2013), p. 52.

Chapter 3 | Turning Your Innovations into Commodities
40
Our decisions have consistently ref lected this focus. We first measure 
ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market 
leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our 
customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the 
strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest 
aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and 
infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.30
Even as Amazon embraced the role of market leadership, its vendors began to 
have second thoughts about putting all of their products in the Amazon shop-
ping cart. Wall Street analyst Ravi Suria wrote a series of widely read reports 
in 2000 that predicted impending disaster for the company. These reports 
coincided with the high point of the dot.bomb crisis, and along with negative 
news reports touting e-commerce as only a passing fad, prompted droves 
of investors to abandon Amazon’s stock. Vendors panicked. John Ingram, the 
president of Ingram, told Amazon executives, “But if you go down, we go down. 
If we’re wrong about you, it’s not ’oh, shucks.’ We have such a concentration 
of our receivables from Amazon that we will be in trouble too.”31 As it turned 
out, the problem wasn’t that Amazon was going down, but that Ingram and so 
many of Amazon’s suppliers had placed so much of their business in Amazon’s 
hands in the first place.
At the turn of the century, the Customer Trap was just one weapon in Amazon’s 
strategic armory. The company’s munitions consisted of many items, including 
numerous acquisitions, logistical expertise, and cutting-edge technology. Soon 
Amazon was experimenting with different calibrations of the Customer Trap.
Amazon found just the right setting in a 2002 dispute with United Parcel 
Service (UPS), when the world’s largest logistics company balked at Amazon’s 
request for price breaks on package delivery. In response, Amazon took the 
next six months to integrate its systems with FedEx and to increase its vol-
ume of shipments, as well as make more frequent use of the United States 
Postal Service. When UPS called what it considered to be Amazon’s bluff at 
a September negotiation, the Mega literally quit shipping with the company. 
Seventy-two hours later, UPS folded and agreed to give Amazon discounted 
shipping rates.32 In the years since, Amazon has effectively pitted UPS and 
FedEx against each other to obtain more-favorable pricing. It has made aggres-
sive use of the Customer Trap, placing  the trap in front of these two compa-
nies at every pickup site, intersection, and screen door. In the winter of 2014,

The Customer Trap

Amazon reduced its volume to FedEx by an annual rate of 50 to 60 million 
packages, resulting in an 8 percent decline in FedEx’s  entire volume. At the 
same time, UPS trucks were up to one-third full of Amazon’s two-day-delivery 
“Prime” packages. One former senior FedEx executive said, “I’d be amazed if 
they are making 5 percent” profit on Amazon’s Prime shipments.33
The upshot for UPS is booming net income and flat profit margins. The num-
bers tell the story. Amazon’s sales increased fourfold, from $19.17 billion in 
2008, to $74.45 billion in 2013. During the same time period, UPS revenues 
rose only 9 percent, to $34.07 billion. However, a 2013 net income of $4.37 
billion at UPS dwarfed Amazon’s paltry net of $274 million. But remarkably, 
“unprofitable” Amazon is clearly in the driver’s seat. Despite its loss-making 
business model, it is able to call the shots with UPS and FedEx. The “strategic” 
response of UPS—the response always given by companies in the Customer 
Trap—is to become more efficient. According to CEO David Abney, e-com-
merce “has challenged some of our traditional ways of doing business,” forcing 
the company to wring costs out of its system in order to advance its position. 
In the second quarter of 2014, UPS’s average delivery cost slipped 1.7 percent 
from the year before, but its revenue fell 2 percent. The upshot is that for UPS, 
the Customer Trap looks like one of those big brown trucks circling the block, 
over and over, looking for an address. Ironically, Uncle Sam has recently been 
testing out the Customer Trap. Lured by the prospect of becoming one of the 
enablers of Amazon’s “free” delivery, the US Postal Service has begun to slash 
prices to get a piece of the action.34
But it has been in the book category that Amazon’s use of the Customer 
Trap can most clearly be observed. In its early years, it obtained books from 
the same distributors that all of the other booksellers used. In 2004, Amazon 
began to aggressively deal with large publishers by demanding significant dis-
counts on bulk purchases, shipping arrangements that leveraged its “reinvigo-
rated” UPS relationship, and an extended period to pay its bills.
The company played hardball with publishers that didn’t go along by threaten-
ing to decrease the visibility of book titles on its web site. Having experienced 
success with this tactic, Bezos initiated the Gazelle Project, based on the notion 
that Amazon should approach small publishers “the way a cheetah would pursue 
a sickly gazelle.”35 The tactic consisted of categorizing publishers on the basis of 
their dependency on Amazon, and then putting the squeeze on the companies 
that were the most vulnerable.This ruthless approach horri f ied publishers. One 
book distributor described it “like dinner with the Godfather.”36

In 2005, Randy Miller, who had helped found Amazon’s jewelry business, took 
over publisher relations. According to author Brad Stone, “Miller took an almost 
sadistic delight in pressuring book publishers to give Amazon more-favorable 
financial terms,” by ranking publishers according to sales and profit margins, 
and then threatening to decrease promotion of laggards who did not go along 
with the new terms. Speaking of Random House, Hachette, and Bloomsbury 
Publishing, Miller stated, “I did everything I could to screw with their perfor-
mance,” including removing books from Amazon’s recommendation listings 
and promoting competitors’ books. This prompted authors, who compulsively 
track sales on Amazon’s Author Central web site, to put the heat on their pub-
lishers. According to Miller, “We would constantly meet with authors, so we’d 
know who would be watching their rankings. I knew these people would be on 
their phones the second they saw their sales numbers drop.”37
Amazon’s relationship with publishers became even more brutal in the wake 
of Kindle, as the Mega priced books so low that it threatened the $26 
hardcovers that were the bread and butter of Barnes & Noble and Borders. 
Literary agent Andrew Wylie states, “What Bezos wants is to drag the retail 
price down as low as he can get it—a dollar-ninety-nine, even ninety-nine 
cents. That’s the Apple play—’What we want is traffic through our device, 
and we’ll do anything to get there.’”38
Bezos had decided that every book must be available through digital delivery 
for $9.99, and Amazon would be tough  with publishers who did not digitize 
their catalogs fast enough. There was no business model behind this pric-
ing, just a firm belief by Amazon that this was the right price. Knowing that the 
publishers would object, the company kept its plans secret until the launch of 
the first Kindle in 2007. While Amazon’s pugnacity was agonizing for publishers, 
it paid off in a big way for Amazon, which completely outmaneuvered competi-
tors such as Barnes & Noble and the now shuttered Borders Group.39
Playing “nice” with its “partners” is simply not part of Amazon’s business 
DNA. Rather, its double helix appears to consist of a core of hostility com-
bined with a kindly tertiary structure that maneuvers companies into the 
Customer Trap. In 2004, Amazon was sued in federal court by Toys “R” Us, 
which argued that it had broken an agreement in which Toys  was to be the 
exclusive seller of the most popular toys sold by the company. In ruling in 
favor of Toys “R” Us, Judge Margaret Mary McVeigh gave the clear impression 
that she was less than impressed with the credibility of Bezos and the other 
Amazon employees who testified. In her ruling she states, “Amazon’s con-
duct has not been consistent with the drafters’ [of the agreement between

the two firms] intent in reaching the Agreement. . . . The language as drafted 
whether intentional or inartful gave Amazon the words to play the game 
their way.” Toys “R” Us prevailed in the case.40
Toys “R” Us had the resources to take Amazon to court. But what of the 
small players that become victims of Amazon’s carefully calibrated Customer 
Trap? Technology has enabled individual creative artists to produce their own 
book projects and market directly to the public. For these people, Amazon’s 
tactics can be crushing. An internationally renowned photographer related his 
experience to us:
The book I published was not a small project. It was a photography 
book, shot over a six-month period. I drove over 20,000 miles to 
get to various locations. Photography books are expensive to print. 
They’re also heavy. This was a big deal and it was costly in both time and 
money. Using their online resources, I researched Amazon as much as 
I possibly could. Their guides were confusing and often contradictory, 
but I thought I had a pretty good understanding of their process.
The first warning came when my books arrived at Amazon’s 
warehouses. I complied with their rules. Every pallet and box was 
individually labeled, but now with my books onsite they insisted that 
each book needed to be labeled as well (beyond the bar code).  
I patiently explained to my not-so-helpful Amazon liaison that this 
was not a requirement according to their own site. She replied that 
I could authorize them to label the books (at a cost) or I could tell 
her where I’d like them to ship the books (at another cost).
A few months later the other shoe dropped. The yearly storage 
fee that Amazon bills me for every book, which is in addition to the 
monthly storage fee they’ve already collected, had been increased. 
Instead of a nominal fee of less than $100, the new fee would be over 
$2,000. I’m not sure how you charge twice for the same exact space 
that has been occupied at the same exact time, but that’s probably 
an issue best explained by quantum physics. I shudder to imagine 
what your average slumlord would do with this information.

44
Suddenly my book had become a lot less profitable. A new, but still-
not-helpful Amazon liaison seemed delighted when he informed me 
I could pay the fee, or I could tell him where to ship the books. The 
fact that this policy was changed without my consent, and nullified 
the original agreement I’d made, was somewhat frustrating. Being 
that as an Amazon Associate I’m required to have a credit card 
on file meant they could charge me whatever and whenever they 
wanted to was somewhat infuriating.
The first year I paid the monthly fee plus the yearly $2,000 storage 
fee. What choice did I have? You have to sell these things, and Amazon 
was an essential element of my distribution model. The second year, 
facing a new bill of over $1,200, I did the unthinkable. I was forced to 
pulp about 600 books. And yes, there’s a charge for that too.
Individual creative artists like the one who wrote this note may be the greatest 
victims of Amazon’s Customer Trap, but in the end, almost everyone “partner-
ing” with Amazon is burned in one way or another. Sadly, the “value” created 
by Amazon is not even captured by Amazon itself. In January 2002, Amazon 
posted a net income of $5 million, the first profitable quarter in its history.41 
In 2013, the company lost $41 million for the year. Shockingly, in the third 
quarter of 2014, the company lost $437 million, all the while sales jumped 
20 percent to $20.58 billion. In comparison, ExxonMobil makes more prof-
its in two-and-a-half weeks than Amazon has made in its entire existence.42 
However, a high stock price propped up by cultic, true-believer investors has 
generated a great deal of wealth for many people—all at the expense of the 
producers of goods and services that the company sells.
In today’s world of business, the accelerating commoditization of innova-
tions occurs so regularly that no one seems to notice. Yet, the damage left 
behind when this happens is starkly apparent. Still, nothing seems to really 
change. As we’ll see next, a lot of this intransigence has to do with who 
controls the information.

When Sales 
Channels Get 
Hijacked
I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion.
—Jack Kerouac
It was not until Amazon’s Jeff Bezos met the “Yoda” of the Customer Trap 
that he learned how to deal ruthlessly with suppliers. In early 2001, Bezos’s 
intuition that a key to business success is to gain leverage over suppliers 
became the fundamental business strategy of Amazon. What had been only a 
gut feeling was transformed into an operating paradigm through a conversation 
over coffee with Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco Wholesale Corporation. 
The Costco model is based on customer loyalty garnered by offering a limited 
selection of products at rock-bottom prices. Costco buys in bulk and uses a 
standard markup of 14 percent. Most of its profit is realized from an annual 
membership fee. It has the ability to create huge sales volume through low 
prices, and thereby demand low prices from its suppliers.
As Sinegal related to Bezos, sometimes vendors resist Costco’s way of doing 
business. “You can fill Safeco Field with the people that don’t want to sell to 
us. But over a period of time, we generate enough business and prove we are 
a good customer and pay our bills and keep our promises.
“Then they [suppliers] say, ‘Why the hell am I not doing business with these 
guys? I gotta be stupid. They are a great form of distribution.’”

Chapter 4 | When Sales Channels Get Hijacked
46
Bezos “took the lessons he learned during that coffee in 2001 and applied 
them with a vengeance.” The following Monday he told his executive staff 
that henceforth Amazon would have “everyday low prices” like Walmart and 
Costco. The company would benchmark its prices against large retailers and 
match their lowest prices every time. In July that year, Amazon cut its prices 
on books, videos, and music from 20 to 30 percent.1
The desire of potential Mega-Customers like Costco and Amazon to domi-
nate their suppliers becomes even more obvious when it is stated on national 
television. Every few months, the business news channel CNBC takes a look 
into a particular company. In 2012 the news staff explored Costco, and as in 
most of these 1-hour documentaries, spent the bulk of the time with the CEO. 
Not surprisingly, the documentary seemed more like an infomercial than any-
thing else. It gave Sinegal a big stage to tout all of the wonderful things about 
Costco. About 16 minutes into the episode, Sinegal said almost exactly the 
same thing in front of the camera that he told Bezos over coffee in 2001.
Carl Quintanilla, the CNBC anchor, asked Sinegal “Are there companies’ 
brands that won’t sell to you?”
Sinegal shot right back. “Sure. You could fill Yankee Stadium with the compa-
nies that don’t want to sell to us at one point or another. . . . If the supplier is 
refusing to sell to us, there’s only one reason why they’re refusing to sell to us. 
And that’s because of the price that we bring the goods to market.”
Then Sinegal stated matter-of-factly, “Eventually we end up getting their prod-
ucts and selling their products.”
How Costco is able to “end up getting their products and selling their prod-
ucts” borders on the unseemly. During the CNBC interview, Sinegal happily 
admitted that Costco regularly buys in the gray market. In this controversial 
practice, retailers circumvent manufacturers and buy products through third-
party distributors.
There are two main types of gray markets. The first one seeks out imported 
manufactured goods that would normally be unavailable or more expensive 
in a certain country. This often happens with the tacit approval of the manu-
facturer, and is viewed as a way to manage inventory and global distribution 
more efficiently.
The second type, which Costco and others frequently engage in, effectively 
punishes those companies that won’t sell through a Mega because they refuse 
to enter the Customer Trap. In an effort to reign in these “outliers,” a Mega 
will purchase at full retail price a large quantity of products through the manu-
facturer’s traditional sales and distribution channel. Then the Mega places the

First Edition, 2013) p. 123–125.

The Customer Trap
47
manufacturer’s products on its shelves at a much lower price than anywhere 
else. Of course, the Mega loses money on the sales. But profit is not the 
Mega’s goal. Instead, it is to send a warning shot across the bow of any recal-
citrant manufacturers: “Do business with us on our terms. If you don’t, we will 
mess up your channels by forcing your distributors to lower their prices to 
match ours. Of course, if they do that they won’t make any money and will 
discontinue buying your product….”
When asked by CNBC’s Quintanilla if he had any qualms about buying and 
selling products through the gray market, Sinegal was unabashed. “What’s 
wrong with it is when people try to manipulate the market so that they can 
control prices and keep prices artificially high. That’s wrong.”2
So, let’s break this down: Here we have the CEO of one of the biggest retail-
ers in the United States stating unequivocally that when a manufacturer tries 
to maintain the integrity of its prices and avoid the Customer Trap, “that’s 
wrong.” From Sinegal’s perspective, it is his responsibility to save the buying 
public from the manipulative behavior of companies that make the invest-
ment to create and develop new products—even if that means Costco has to 
engage in manipulative and dubious behavior!
In the minds of many Mega-Customers, it is the distributor who is the most 
important player in capitalism. Innovators, creators, and builders are really 
nothing more than pawns in a business system that they have created. And 
while the Megas neither invented anything—nor took the huge risks to bring a 
new product to market—it is their sheer size that gives them unquestionable 
moral authority. They know what’s best for the rest of us.
The hubris is beyond stupefying.
A Step Back Before Moving Forward
As we’ve stated earlier, the fundamental reality of the Customer Trap is the 
wholesale takeover of an innovator’s business by a Mega-Customer. When 
the 10 Percent Rule gets broken, control gets wrestled away and power  
inexorably shifts toward the reseller and distributor. The growing depen-
dency on a single customer dramatically reduces the ability of the innovating  
company to influence what happens to its products in the value chain.
Still—and this is an important point—resellers, intermediaries, and distribu-
tors are not by nature hostile and to be avoided at all costs. When properly 
managed, resellers, intermediaries, and distributors serve critical functions 
in helping to build the brands of their suppliers. If a customer continues to

represent 10 percent or less of a company’s total revenue—even if it is one 
of the big boxes, or the dominant player in another sector of the economy—
the power balance remains tipped in the favor of the innovator, which is the 
way capitalism is supposed to work. The biggest gains should go to those  
who take the biggest risks. Other partners should benefit as well—if they add 
value. Nevertheless, the largest share of profits should go to those with the 
most skin in the game. The Customer Trap occurs when this principle is vio-
lated, and those who have invested little capture the lion’s share.
Holding Data Hostage
The Customer Trap can be observed in the realm of data sharing and informa-
tion transparency. Over the past quarter century, one of the most important 
features of business has involved the acquisition and control of information. 
The adage “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” rings truer than 
ever. Since the advent of the information age, corporate leaders have sought 
to acquire additional and better information about every aspect of their  
businesses, so that they can manage more effectively.
No one worth his or her salt today would question the importance of orga-
nizing and understanding data. Business schools around the world have been 
outdoing each other to launch new MBA programs and courses in business 
analytics. Consulting firms are touting “big data” as the next phase in the 
advancement of the knowledge economy. Articles appear every day in the 
business press underscoring the benefits of harnessing information.
Of course, to accomplish this, information needs to flow both upstream and 
downstream, as well as inside and outside the company. The frequency of the 
information flow, as well the degree of the information’s transparency, combine 
to determine the quality of the data that will be used in decision making.
The underlying assumption is that this information, melded with constant 
improvements in data-collection software, better analytical tools, and the 
seemingly ubiquitous “cloud,” will unleash a new era, in which information will 
empower leaders in ways never dreamed of. Like most assumptions, however, 
it works only when it works.
In what can aptly be described as a true paradox, despite the widespread avail-
ability of data in business today, the presence of Mega-Customers has blocked 
the ability of many innovative companies to get access to the information they 
desperately need. While the data exists, it is simply not made accessible by 
many Mega-Customers to their suppliers.
Many companies are simply flying blind when it comes to what happens to 
their innovations after entering sales and distribution channels. The ability to 
acquire information about what is happening to the innovation gets thwarted 

The Customer Trap
49
by the Mega-Customer. In consumer retail goods, for example, brick-and-
mortar Megas—Walmart, Target, The Home Depot, and so forth—can hold 
hostage the data of their suppliers’ products. When it is convenient for the 
Mega, it will release some information to the supplier. But this is done only 
when it serves the Mega’s interest.
Even more depressing, many suppliers in this sector of the economy have 
thrown in the towel about ever getting data about the innovations from their 
Mega-Customers. They assume that lack of access to data is normal, merely 
“the way things have always been done.” The customer is always right, right? If 
the Mega-Customer won’t voluntarily share information about our products, 
then who are we to ask? As a result, American companies are often shooting 
in the dark when it comes to managing their enterprises. Table 4-1 shows the 
major challenges related to channel data associated with various functional 
areas of business.

3This was developed jointly between Zyme Solutions and the authors.
In the area of marketing, for example, one wonders how a company can  
determine what the market thinks about its brands and products when it may 
not know who end users and final customers even are. This lack of under-
standing makes it harder to recognize obstacles standing in the way of getting 
a product to market, and it blocks the view as to what opportunities might be 
found on the other side of the intermediary.

Chapter 4 | When Sales Channels Get Hijacked
50
An illustration of how this lack of information transparency plays out is in 
the area of sales and distribution. As former distributors and manufacturers 
ourselves, the term “channel incentives” sends painful pulses down our spines. 
In order to enhance their product’s visibility within a clogged or confused 
channel and drive sales, many manufacturers seek to increase the incentives 
offered downstream. Historically, the belief has been that by enticing channel 
partners with tangible financial rewards, attention by those partners will be 
refocused on a specific product or line. And, while the notion of providing 
an inducement is rooted in a rational theory about human behavior, things 
in reality are far more complicated. It reminds us of Yogi Berra’s dictum: “In 
theory, there is no difference between practice and theory. In practice, there 
is a difference.”
When we dig deeper into the effectiveness of channel incentives, for example, 
we find that a huge hole exists when it comes to the billions of dollars that 
are simply unaccounted for. Inefficiency, it seems, is the operative term. We 
estimate that approximately $1 trillion of sales in the high-tech sector, around 
20 percent, is paid back through performance incentives to channel partners. 
This includes rebates, discounts, SPIFs, and the like to dealers, resellers, dis-
tributors, and other partners. This totals close to $200 billion. We have found 
that around 10 percent of that amount is either overclaimed or paid to the 
wrong entity. This is in the neighborhood of $20 billion!
In addition, another $200 billion in current inventory is being held at any time 
within high-tech distribution channels. It is estimated that 30 to 40 percent is 
at risk of being written off, discounted, or being deemed obsolete; and, of that 
number, 10 to 20 percent is simply not available due to channel inefficiency. 
This means another $6 billion to $16 billion has been misallocated.
Believe it or not, little or no research on this problem is occurring within 
the $2.5 trillion industrial sector. If we assume, for a moment, that the num-
bers from the high-tech sector are somewhat applicable to the industrial side, 
we are somewhere, conservatively, around $50 billion in the misallocation of 
channel incentives and loss in inventory value.
Managing supply chains on a good day, when there is transparency of informa-
tion, is challenging enough. Keeping track of where things are, and where they 
are going, requires access to a constant flow of good data. Take it away, and 
everything becomes Alice in Wonderland, where down is up and left is right.
Information technology can be a wonderful asset to a company, so long as the 
inputted data is of high quality and reliability. Remove that data stream, how-
ever, and even the best analytics team is left shooting in the dark about what 
is really going on out there.
The same rings true on the human side of the enterprise. Being able to iden-
tify changes in the marketplace that will require additional employees before 
the competition does is a proven method to recruit the best talent. Of course, 

The Customer Trap
51
staying a step ahead in recruiting is far easier when one can anticipate how 
the needs of the marketplace are changing. The same is true when retaining 
the best talent. Keeping top employees knowledgeable about emerging best 
practices is a way to maintain and build loyalty. Each of these requires a strong 
recognition of what is really happening. If a Mega-Customer is hijacking critical 
data about a company’s products and services, it is nearly impossible to remain 
the kind of proactive employer many top performers want to work for.
The wide range of financing instruments available to a company today is truly 
impressive. Despite much of the bad rap attached to recent financial innova-
tions—a lot of it deserved—there has been an exponential rise in the number, 
quality, and availability of commercial financing options. To weigh the value of 
any of these, it is critical for a company to possess the requisite information 
about itself before jumping in. How can this assessment be done if Mega-
Customers are not providing the data needed? Risk management faces the 
same constraints. To paraphrase former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld, unknown unknowns are impossible to assess because we don’t 
know about them.
A significant amount of new product failure is rooted here. Innovators go to 
market with one arm tied behind their backs. They simply don’t possess the 
necessary information to manage in an increasingly complex world. If—by 
hard work, blood, sweat, and tears—they have done things right and intro-
duced something of real value into the marketplace, without the data from 
their sales and distribution channels, innovators are left merely wishing for 
a better tomorrow. They can only go with their guts and hope, like a child  
at Christmas, that something magical will occur when they make the next 
uninformed decision.
Certainly having all the data available is no guarantee of success. Business is 
hard enough, even when we can know what is going on. But operating without 
the data is a recipe for disaster. What a tragic waste of scarce R&D resources, 
incentives, and human creativity! It doesn’t have to be this way. Still, too often, 
it is.
In the end, the lack of information transparency enables power-hungry entities 
and perhaps even nefarious individuals and groups to hijack the hard-fought 
innovations of so many companies. Ceding too much control to a Mega-
Customer has nothing but downside risks. If you think it can’t get any worse, 
read on.

Living the 
Outsourcing 
Compulsion
I don’t pay good wages because I have a lot of money; I have a lot of 
money because I pay good wages.
—Robert Bosch
The conventional wisdom in government, business schools, and much of 
industry is that companies choose to close their costly domestic operations 
in favor of better prospects and profits in other countries. The ability to 
manufacture a product for 30 percent to 50 percent less than it would cost 
at home is widely considered to be the reason that American firms have 
flocked overseas in recent years. Thus far, the outsourcing (or, more properly, 
“offshoring”) conversation has pitted shrinking transaction costs, enhanced 
efficiencies, and fat profits against job loss, societal disruption, and a sense of 
economic angst as industries restructure themselves to conform to the new 
realities of the digitized, global age.1

Often unrecognized in the outsourcing-offshoring discussion is the ­strategic 
dimension. In fact, the compulsive embrace of overseas outsourcing—­
particularly the outsourcing rush, first to India, then Mexico, and later China, 
and now to even lower-cost locations such as Bangladesh and Vietnam—has 
less to do with international business than it has to do with how products 
are bought and sold in the domestic, American marketplace. The offshoring 
phenomenon is really about the purposeful weakening of America’s indus-
trial structure brought about as a business strategy by Mega-Customers. The 
move of American producers overseas is not so much an effort to seek new 
markets and new opportunities as it is a defensive response to power tactics 
the Megas employ here at home.
The underlying reality is that it is not corporate avarice that is driving 
large ­percentages of manufacturing out of the United States. What is forc-
ing ­thousands of companies to close US operations and lay off workers is 
the imbalance in the sales and distribution model described in the previous 
chapters. The compulsive embrace of offshoring by US firms is not a function 
of internally generated goals and objectives, but it is, instead, driven by the 
sheer demands of corporate survival.
Globalization: A Mostly Necessary Evil
Unlike much of the rest of the world, globalization for most US companies 
has been often a tangential afterthought. Growth opportunities do abound for 
American companies outside the domestic market, where around 70 percent 
of all business activity takes place. Certainly the rise of emerging markets in 
recent years has provided opportunities to engage new middle-class consum-
ers. US firms have long known that the power of American brands resonates 
across the globe. Apple, The Coca Cola Company, Caterpillar, and Google, 
among others, are as well known in Astana or Asuncion as they are in Akron. 
Nevertheless, the vast majority of US companies have still remained focused 
on servicing the massive internal consumer market—around $419 billion in 
consumer goods alone.2 While China, for example, has the world’s largest 
population at around 1.4 billion, the number of Chinese who live a Western 
middle-class lifestyle today is only around 70 million–not much more than the 
combined populations of Argentina and Peru. In the end, much of American 
business, including outsourcing and offshoring, remains squarely focused on 
what happens at home.

The Customer Trap

Since the end of the Civil War, the US market has been far and away the 
biggest single prize for all sorts of businesses. The unparalleled combination 
of a secure continental island, almost unlimited natural resources, a small 
and unobtrusive government relative to its size, a dynamic system of capital  
creation and allocation, and a culture of entrepreneurship have made the 
United States unique in human history. These forces have blended in such 
a way that providence appears to be behind it all. For each of the past  
15 decades, despite recessions, depressions, crashes, and bubbles, the US econ-
omy was richer at the end of the decade than it was at the beginning.3 In fact, 
the rise of the United States as the dominant global economic force has been 
the business story for the past 150 years. As John Steele Gordon observed, 
the United States became over a century ago—and remains today—“An 
Empire of Wealth.”
By the end of World War II, the United States emerged as more than just 
an economic superpower. The US Navy reigned supreme on the sea and had 
the greatest fleet ever to sail. America’s aircraft patrolled the skies without 
any interference, having already shown the nation’s capacity and willingness 
to both build and deploy the atom bomb—twice. Hollywood entertained the 
world. More than half of all the capital on planet Earth was in American hands. 
No country in history was ever so powerful. Maybe God really did “shed His 
grace on thee.”
Then, with all of this power in its hands, America did something unique in the 
course of human events. Instead of going back to the antiquities-old playbook 
of subjecting newly vulnerable peoples to vengeful punishments, the Americans 
truly shocked the world. Starting at the Bretton Woods Conference in July 
1944, the United States reached out to its weakened allies and vanquished 
enemies and made an unbelievable offer: we will give you the needed capital 
to start rebuilding your countries and will carry the burden of protecting 
you from the aggressions of those who threaten you. In exchange, the United 
States asked for support in expanding American-style capitalism around the 
world. Further, to sweeten the deal—if it wasn’t already sweet enough—the 
Americans declared that under the banner of free trade, foreign products and 
companies would have almost unrestricted access to the massive US market.
When the Americans laid out this deal, no one could believe their ears. Here 
was the most dominant nation in history saying that its strategic vision for the 
future was a world built on consumers and producers. And, incredibly, nearly 
all the costs and burdens of securing that vision would be borne not by the 
losers; rather, the winners of the war would do the heavy lifting for years to 
come. It all seemed to good be true. Yet, it was true.

Without having to contend with Soviet aggression or worry about centuries-
long rivalries with their neighbors, countries like the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea could focus exclusively on rebuilding 
their economies. The security blanket provided by the United States ensured 
that business could be done without interference from others seeking to 
intrude on their growth. The stimulus provided by American capital through 
programs like the Marshall Plan jump-started much of Western Europe and 
Eastern Asia. Later, a significant portion of their prosperity would come from 
exporting to the United States. The eventual integration of China into the 
global economy initiated by President Nixon in 1972, and the collapse of the 
Soviet Union in 1990, assured for the foreseeable future that the dominant 
global idea would be capitalism as practiced in America.
To understand how that American-style capitalism evolved in the United 
States, particularly as it related to sales and distribution, requires a look back 
to the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Sales and Distribution: A Look Back
In the middle of the 19th century, sales and distribution was a haphazard 
proposition. As the United States spread westward, settlers were served by 
itinerant peddlers who sold goods obtained from Eastern cities or from iso-
lated Western outposts. Shopkeepers in remote areas filled their inventories 
through semiannual shopping trips to large cities. The development of the 
railroad and the telegraph—innovations that make today’s Internet pale by 
comparison—transformed the way business was done.
The initial beneficiary of the new technologies were wholesalers, also known 
as “jobbers.” These individuals took title to goods purchased directly from 
producers through big buying networks, and sold to general stores on the 
frontier through large-scale (for the times) marketing organizations. The speed 
and predictability of the railroad, coupled with the ability to order goods 
through the telegraph, expanded the distribution capacity of jobbers, thereby 
reducing unit costs, which in turn led to higher profits. Just as the convenience 
of the new system allowed shopkeepers to concentrate on their local busi-
nesses, manufacturers benefited by receiving immediate payment rather than 
having to wait for their goods to be sold.
With the end of the Civil War, the country store of the Midwest spread 
throughout the South, supplied by full-service wholesaling firms that domi-
nated distribution during the second half of the century. Supported by a legion 
of salesmen who travelled by train and carriage, wholesalers were able to help 
shopkeepers upgrade operations, improve accounting practices, and enhance 
merchandise presentation. In addition, they developed sophisticated purchasing 
operations. The activity of these buyers varied greatly because each product 
line required specific expertise and a specialized approach to the market.

The Customer Trap
57
In some instances, goods were sourced directly from manufacturers over-
seas. Circumstances sometimes required that private brands be developed 
for the wholesalers. At other moments, a wholesaler would become the sole 
distributor for a manufacturer’s product. While backward integration into 
manufacturing occurred on occasion, most wholesalers focused on buying and 
selling rather than producing.
The wholesaler was largely an organizer of economic activity. Functional 
areas typically included the “traffic” department, which dealt with scheduling  
shipments from manufacturers, to warehouses, to retailers. As the system 
developed, a measure of performance evolved that is still with us today. Stock-
turn was defined as “the number of times stock on hand was sold and replaced 
within a specified time period, usually annually.”4 Stock-turn measured the 
velocity of distribution. High stock-turn indicated that products were spend-
ing less time sitting on storeroom shelves, which meant lower unit costs and 
higher output per worker. It was the development of the telegraph and the 
railroad that made high stock-turn an achievable objective and created the 
possibility of mass marketing.
Emergence of Mass Retailing
By 1880, wholesalers began to be surpassed by either mass retailers, who 
bought directly from producers and sold through their own stores, or by 
manufacturers who built their own wholesale operations. In both instances, 
the activities of the previously dominant wholesalers were taken over, creating 
greater operational efficiencies. Retailers prevailed because they were able to 
achieve increases in economies of scale (lower costs associated with the vol-
ume of a product) and scope (lower costs associated with marketing different 
types of products) than wholesalers.
The new mass retailers came in four forms: department stores, mail-order 
houses, retail chains, and vertically integrated firms.
Department Stores
Department stores were an urban phenomenon. Retail operations that sold 
clothing or dry goods became department stores when they added furniture, 
glassware, jewelry, and other new product lines. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s 
followed this course, as did Nieman-Marcus and Marshall Field’s. The impetus 
behind the department store was the burgeoning of city populations in the 
decades following the Civil War. As the cities swelled with people, new lines

(New York, NY: Belknap Press, 1977), p. 223.

Chapter 5 | Living the Outsourcing Compulsion
58
were added—carpets, upholstered goods, furs, men’s and women’s clothing, 
hats, shoes, toys—to satisfy the demands of a new, urban consumer class. The 
strategy of these stores was fairly uniform:
They were aimed at maintaining the high-volume, high-turnover flow 
of business by selling at low prices and low margins. Profits were to 
be made on volume, not markup. . . . Above all, the mass retailers 
concentrated on maintaining a high level of stock-turn. This they did 
by marking down slow-moving lines, by extensive local advertising, 
and by creating a clearly defined management structure.5
Department stores were managed as decentralized holding companies, where 
the department head was king, free to make nearly all decisions about buying 
and selling goods, accountable to the central organization only for his financial 
performance. The head of a shoe department, for example, would make all of 
the decisions about where to buy shoes, how to price shoes, and even how 
advertising copy would read in the store’s shoe ads.
Occasionally, department stores would integrate backward into manufactur-
ing to produce a limited selection of products, such as clothing or upholstery. 
However, this was fairly rare, and management usually avoided controlling or 
managing the activities of their suppliers. Instead, as mentioned earlier, the 
strategy of the early department stores was based on stock-turn (velocity). 
For example, Marshall Field’s had a stock-turn of 5 for most of the 20th cen-
tury, while Macy’s had a stock-turn of 12 for the year 1887. High stock-turns 
led to the ability to make more money with lower margins by selling at lower 
prices. Small retailers, complaining bitterly about this new, unfair competition, 
demanded state legislation that would protect them from the lower prices of 
the department stores.
Mail-Order Houses
The telegraph and railroad also paved the way for the first direct marketers. 
Though present in a limited form before the Civil War, mail-order houses 
came into full bloom in the years that followed. The first organization to sell 
a wide variety of products exclusively through catalog sales was Montgomery 
Ward, with catalogs in excess of 500 pages listing about 24,000 products. Sears, 
Roebuck & Company followed, and by 1895 it sold practically every consumer 
product that was then available through a 532-page catalog. Items included 
shoes, wagons, fishing tackle, stoves, china, saddles, firearms, buggies, glassware, 
5Ibid., p. 227.

59
and musical instruments. Sales of $400,000 in 1893 nearly doubled two years 
later.6 Like the department stores of the day, each merchandising depart-
ment was fully autonomous; the buyer was in complete control of volume,  
catalog pricing, and the prices paid to vendors. The geometric growth in sales 
volume experienced by the mail-order houses prompted them to integrate 
backward into manufacturing. By 1906, Sears operated 16 manufacturing 
plants in order to maintain a steady supply of items for its numerous product 
lines. Its sophisticated system of logistics allowed it to surpass the retail vol-
ume of the department stores.
The ability of Sears and Montgomery Ward to increase profits through 
lower prices based on velocity (high stock-turn) and lower margins created 
a political fracas during the first decade of the 20th century. Smaller retailers 
and wholesalers railed against perceived unfair competition just as they had 
against department stores during previous decades. Despite protests, a bill 
extending parcel post service into rural areas was passed in 1912. Mass retail-
ing was not stymied by entrenched, local interests. In fact, it was fostered by 
governmental action.
Chain Stores
Chain stores came to the fore in American retailing at the beginning of the 
new century. By the 1920s, they were under the same sort of political attack 
that had landed upon the department stores and mail-order houses years 
before. Chain stores differed from department stores in two ways: First, they 
consisted of multiple stores carrying similar merchandise spread out over 
a geographical area. Second, unlike the department stores and mail-order 
houses, they were centrally managed. Whereas buyers at the other forms of 
retail enterprise operated departments as independent principalities, manag-
ers of chain stores took their orders from the central office.
Referring to chain stores, one writer from the 1920s stated, “Some are  
centrally owned but independently operated. Some are centrally controlled 
and operated—this being the prevailing and most successful type.”7 Buyers 
consisted of specialists at the chain’s headquarters. Hiring and firing was

in John Perkins and Craig Freedman, “Organizational Form and Retailing Development: The 
Department and the Chain Store, 1860-1940,” Services Industries Journal (1999), p. 129.

60
controlled by personnel departments. Store managers were likened to 
­engineers operating locomotives. The key was standardization:
The process of standardization is extended to almost every phase 
of chain activity; the stores are alike in appearance; the interior 
equipment is the same; the stock and position of the stock on the 
shelves of one store corresponds to that of any other store in the 
chain; the instructions given for running the stores are identical. 
Each manager has to fill out the same forms daily, to carry out the 
same routine of caring for cash, of locking up for the night, of all the 
detailed minutiae of storekeeping.8
F.W. Woolworth operated seven stores in Pennsylvania in the early 1880s. 
By the turn of the century it had sales of $5 million, and by 1909 it 
­operated 318 stores throughout the United States. Similar to other 
retailers, success was based on stock-turn. In the mid-1920s, Sears and 
Montgomery Ward began chain stores of their own; a similar course was  
followed by large department stores in the 1930s.
During this period, producer-retailer relationships were under stress largely 
due to the power exercised by manufacturers coupled with the lack of 
­interdependency among production and distribution activities. For most of 
the century, communications were carried out through the mail or through 
expensive “long-distance” phone calls. Computers, which didn’t become 
­commercially available until the 1960s, were expensive, difficult to use, and 
could not “talk” to each other. Industry leader Walmart didn’t begin using 
information technology to coordinate with its vendors until 1987, and e-mail 
was not widely used until the mid-1990s. The ability to communicate, which 
we take for granted today, was a more complicated undertaking in years past.
Vertically Integrated Firms
Throughout most of the 20th century, the exception to the middleman  
situation existed in the vertically integrated firm, which combined manufac-
turing along with the sales and distribution function. By coordinating business 
activities within the firm rather than through external markets, producing 
companies could control all aspects of distribution, avoid dealing with interme-
diaries, and eliminate the need to negotiate with sales entities. Manufacturers 
developed distribution capacity, including sales, service, financing, installation 
and other appropriate ancillary activities.

By owning their own retail outlets, these firms were able to monitor ­customer 
desires, better understand markets, and more carefully plan how best to approach 
buyer segments. National Cash Register, Remington Typewriter Company, 
Eastman Kodak Company, and Pabst Brewing Company are examples of produc-
ers that operated their own retail outlets during this period.
Arrival of the Megas
Although telecommunications, rails, and, eventually, trucking provided the 
means through which mass distribution expanded during the 20th century, 
relationships between producers and end users were limited. Transactions 
were overwhelmingly “arm’s length,” wherein manufacturers exploited econo-
mies of scale to lower costs, maximize production, and “push” their prod-
ucts onto the marketplace with little understanding of how much consumer 
demand really existed.
The need to coordinate supply and demand was filled by wholesalers,  
dealers, and distributors—middlemen—that stood between manufacturers 
and retailers. By managing huge inventories, these intermediaries served as 
buffers between producers and sellers, thereby limiting the need for coordina-
tion between the two.9 Later technological advances created new tools that 
changed the dynamics between manufacturers and consumers.
The business historian Alfred Chandler explains the underlying economic 
logic of the wholesalers and new mass-market retailers, along with the emer-
gence of the Megas:
The intermediaries’ cost advantage had resulted from exploiting 
the economies of both scale and scope. Because they handled the 
products of many manufacturers, they achieved a greater volume and 
lower costs per unit than did any one manufacturer in the marketing 
and distribution of a single line of products (scale). Moreover, they 
increased this advantage by the broader scope of their operation—
that is, by handling a number of related product lines through a 
single set of activities (scope).10
Velocity was king. Economies of scale and scope ruled. What Chandler 
calls “managerial capitalism” was based on the idea that managers coordi-
nated production and distribution activities within huge firms because it was 
more efficient than allowing the market to handle transactions through the  
“invisible hand.” In fact, Chandler titled one of his books on the topic

The Visible Hand, implying that the invisible hand of the marketplace had  
been displaced by the visible hand of managerial activity. He states that, “The 
mass-marketers replaced merchants as distributors of goods in the American 
economy because they internalized a high volume of market transactions 
within a single large modern enterprise.”11
Increasing stock-turn by growing volume, adding new lines of products, 
and opening new outlets allowed the mass marketers to price their prod-
ucts below that of smaller retailers who relied upon wholesalers, and to still  
be more profitable than those wholesalers. The mass-market retailers who 
benefited from this process—Gimbels, Hartfords, Woolworths, Kresges, and 
so forth—became phenomenally wealthy.
“Strategic Thinking”
In the early 1970s, manufacturers began to respond to the exhortations of 
management theorists who preached a doctrine of business transformation 
that emphasized resources, capabilities, innovation, technology, and opera-
tional effectiveness. Companies that had once been in control of all aspects of 
product development, sales, and service were slowly convinced by “leading” 
business thinkers to focus exclusively on “core competencies” and to get rid 
of everything else. Consequently, big companies began to divest themselves 
of activities that were not perceived as “value adding,” while, at the same 
time, embracing operational paradigms that emphasized total quality manage-
ment, material requirement planning, just-in-time inventory control, and lean 
manufacturing.
Eventually, efforts to “stick to the knitting” paid off, and firm boundaries 
underwent dramatic changes. Companies that previously had exercised power 
over their value chains were now outsourcing almost everything except those 
activities that they considered to be unique to their bases of sustainable 
competitive advantage. With rising pressure from perceived higher-quality 
Japanese companies, American manufacturers ended up spinning off not only 
business functions unrelated to their core resources and competencies, but 
also valuable distribution and sales capabilities.
By the end of decade, technological advances accelerated the amount of inef-
ficiency that could be squeezed out of the retail sector. Today it is difficult to 
imagine a time when checkers manually entered numbers into a cash register 
and counted back change correctly, or when an individual standing in line 
waited patiently while the person in front of him slowly wrote out a check. 
Supply chain management, data mining and analytics, along with sophisticated 
logistics and inventory controls helped lead to the rise of the Megas.

The Customer Trap
63
The big change came in 1987, heralded by a new approach based on the  
relationship between Proctor & Gamble (P&G) and Walmart. A former 
Walmart executive explains what happened:
We both decided that the entire relationship between vendor 
and retailer was at issue. Both had focused on the end user—the 
customer—but each did it independently of the other. No sharing 
of information, no planning together, no systems coordination. We 
were simply two giant entities going our separate ways, oblivious 
to the excess costs created by the obsolete system. We were 
communicating, in effect, by slipping notes under the door. . . . 
Following the P&G/Walmart partnership, many other companies 
began to view the supplier as an important partner.12
Improvements in manufacturing processes and technology were making it 
possible for suppliers to the new Megas to customize products according the 
requirements of the end user. The need for extensive inventories diminished 
as the “marketing concept” became widespread and producers developed the 
capability to tailor-make products with short production runs through just-in-
time manufacturing and other methods.
The Current American System
In previous eras, international business looked much different than it does 
today. The vast majority of American businesses focused on meeting the 
needs and aspirations of the ever-expanding domestic market through local 
production, sales, and distribution. Sourcing of raw materials from abroad was 
always an option and one that US companies engaged in when it made sense. 
Still, most products from US firms were sold to Americans, and nearly all  
services were of American origin.
At the same time, foreign companies benefited immensely from low entry bar-
riers into the American market and were able to access the huge domestic 
consumer base. These included Japan’s Honda Motor Company, Panasonic 
Corporation, and Sony Corporation; and Germany’s Bosch, Siemens, and 
Volkswagen. While an exporting strategy was the initial way foreign firms 
entered the US market, long-term success was later found in locating entire 
operations in the country. Honda’s Marysville, Ohio, plant first opened in 1978 
to build motorcycles. Just a few years later, right next door, the Japanese com-
pany launched its first automotive plant in the United States. Being as close as 
possible to the American customer was the goal.

Presently, businesses in sales and distribution networks are reliant upon 
the products and services offered by other firms. Increasing population,  
hyper-competition, technology, globalization, specialization, and the ability to 
“unbundle” the value-adding activities of the companies involved in producing 
and distributing products has created an environment in which the “invisible 
hand” of the market seems to rule once again. Business historian Richard 
Langlois of the University of Connecticut explains as follows:
In many respects, the structure of this new model looks more like 
that of the antebellum era than like that of the era of managerial 
capitalism. Production takes place in numerous distinct firms, 
whose outputs are coordinated through market exchange broadly 
understood. . . . Vertical disintegration and specialization is perhaps 
the most significant organizational development of the late  
20th century.13
In the new global environment, in which companies find sourcing through 
the marketplace to be more efficient than building in-house, outsourcing and 
offshoring is a way of life. Globalization created a situation whereby these 
efficiencies were sought not only in the domestic market, but throughout 
the world. To see how globalization has become a major weapon in the 
Mega’s arsenal, you must look carefully at what is meant when people refer to  
“foreign direct investment.”
Foreign Direct Investment
Academic theories suggest that companies engage in foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) overseas in order to acquire customers and new markets, to 
access raw materials, or to garner cheap labor. Recent investment in China, 
for example, has been explained in a number of ways. With 1.4 billion people, 
it is the world’s largest potential market. Firms rushed in, hoping to capitalize 
on an emerging middle class that is expected to grow exponentially in coming 
years.14 Until recently, the average manufacturing pay was less than $1 an hour, 
which also made it an attractive option for firms desiring lower wage rates. 
Finally, in some industries, China offers distinctive skills and expertise that are 
superior to those found in the United States. For example, Chinese engineers 
are on the cutting edge of developing technologies in the wireless chip and 
software industries, and they display formidable product and logistics skills

in auto-part manufacturing. 15 Each of these situations results from different 
motives for engaging in foreign direct investment.
FDI takes place when a company from one country makes an investment 
in another. It is distinguished from portfolio investment in that by definition,  
FDI involves both ownership and control. Examples of FDI include McDonald’s 
opening one of its restaurants in Moscow in 1990, Timken’s acquiring roller 
bearing manufacturing facilities in Romania in 1997, and Lenovo’s acquisition of 
IBM’s x86 server business in 2014. Each of these was an instance in which the 
parent company invested in foreign countries in order to access customers. 
This “market-seeking” FDI is typically what we see in the United States when 
firms from abroad build auto plants (for example, Toyota), buy our iconic 
firms (for example, Anheuser-Busch), or work with American companies on 
joint-venture projects (Électricité de France and Constellation Energy). The 
other type of foreign direct investment is called “factor seeking FDI.” This 
occurs when firms are in search of factors of production, such as raw materi-
als or cheap labor. But what is not considered in theories of FDI is the fact 
that many US companies have been pushed into outsourcing production, using 
joint ventures, or contract manufacturing—forced to close domestic factories 
and hire overseas companies to manufacturer their products—whether they 
want to or not.
In China, which opened up for business in 1979, western managers initially 
thought in terms of the huge Chinese market. A billion people are a lot of 
potential customers, especially considering what is likely to be considerable 
pent-up consumer demand. However, the FDI that flows into countries in the 
early stages of economic development tends to go to infrastructure projects, 
not consumer products. The Chinese government cherry-picked FDI, bringing 
in businesses needed for modernization, and firms that were export oriented. 
It did not allow foreigners to buy Chinese companies or set up their own  
subsidiaries. Until the mid-1990s, foreign firms operating in China were 
required to work with a Chinese joint-venture firm.
But if American businesses were unable to take immediate advantage of 
Chinese markets in order to produce gross profit, they quickly learned that 
an abundance of cheap Chinese labor could add to their bottom-line growth. 
It wasn’t until the 1990s that the Chinese government allowed foreign firms to 
manufacture and sell consumer products in the domestic market. By that time, 
the pattern had been set and China was utilized as a manufacturing platform 
for the purpose of producing in-country, in order to sell offshore.
The intent of the Chinese government was to maximize the opportunity to 
learn from international partners and secure foreign capital. The Chinese

Innovation Policy for the Global Economy (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2012).

feared that unless foreign companies were forced to team up with local  
partners, they would become little more than an export platform—an assem-
bler of components that were invented and understood only in the advanced 
industrial world. Instead, a joint-venture strategy was pursued, and today, China 
is heavily engaged in R&D and new product development within the context 
of a large, but still emerging, economy.
Forced joint ventures come at a cost, however, and what was appealing to the 
Chinese government was often unappealing to American firms. Intellectual 
property infringement, operational and logistical difficulties, and the entire 
panoply of challenges that accompany large-scale operations in cross-cultural 
settings served to mute the joint-venture enthusiasm of US firms. Still, relent-
less pressure from their Mega-Customers at home forced countless American 
firms to swallow the bitter pill and outsource abroad. They really had no other 
choice.
The opening of China could not have come at a better time for the Megas. 
Information technology, particularly the rapid adoption of the Internet as 
a means of information sharing, eased difficulties associated with overseas 
manufacturing. The Megas, encumbered by mature market environments, 
hyper-competition, and unrelenting price pressures, were forced to look at 
the efficiency of operations in order to meet performance expectations. They 
were met halfway by their vendors, who had been fixated on a raft of manage-
ment theories for 20 years or more. Instead of thinking about connections 
between production and distribution, manufacturers were thinking only about 
how to become more efficient. Let’s take a closer look at an example of one 
retailer’s forays into China and its impact on the US economy.
Walmart in China
Sam Walton had an early interest in sourcing from China, and by the mid-1980s, 
the company was importing a significant amount of merchandise. Concerned 
about America’s growing trade deficit, he launched the “Bring It Home to the 
U.S.A.” program in 1985. For several years, sourcing from Asia was managed 
through an organization created by Walmart—the Pacific Resources Export 
Limited. Walton wanted to buy from American companies, but only if domes-
tic firms could compete with overseas suppliers.
After a period of stagnation following Walton’s death in 1992, the company 
expanded its own in-house brands by working through unbranded suppliers 
in China.16 Indifference to human rights issues by the Clinton administration, 
and the entrance of the country into the World Trade Organization in 2001, 
further legitimized China as the major supplier of products sold at Walmart.

Pressed to lower their prices, Walmart suppliers repeatedly have made the 
discovery that their only option is to shift production overseas. Lakewood 
Engineering & Manufacturing Company is a case in point. For years, this electric 
fan manufacturer sold its 20-inch box fan for $20. Responding to Walmart’s 
downward price pressure, the company opened a factory in Shenzhen in 2000, 
where labor costs averaged $.25 per hour compared with $13 per hour in 
Chicago. By 2003, the fan was sold at the Megas for $10.
In 2008, employees of Lakewood protested, alongside local labor organiza-
tions, the company’s decision to close its electric heater operations and move 
production to China. Walmart bought 80 to 90 percent of the company’s 
heaters. Lakewood claimed that its hands were tied because it was heavily 
mortgaged to Wells Fargo Bank, which refused to lend it more money. The 
company’s relationship with the Mega resulted in the layoff of 220 workers 
and the outsourcing of production. The company went into involuntary bank-
ruptcy in 2009 and was sold to Sunbeam Products.17 Who was making money 
in this deal? Clearly not the manufacturer. 18
Lakewood Engineering & Manufacturing is not the exception. Seventy percent 
of the products sold at Walmart either originate from China or have compo-
nents manufactured in China.19 If Walmart was a country, it would be the 27th 
largest economy in the world.20 A commentary in Forbes sums it up:
Walmart’s decision to outsource manufacturing to China was one of 
the reasons behind the hollowing out of US manufacturing, especially 
at the low end. According to the Economic Policy Institute, Walmart’s 
imports helped to destroy 200,000 US manufacturing jobs. It also 
helped China become a world power. Walmart now wants to bring 
manufacturing back to the US and is creating a $10 million fund to 
support US manufacturing. . . . But a $10 million fund is a proverbial 
flea going out to war with an elephant.21

And the Others Soon Follow
In fact, outsourcing to China has been a phenomenon. The most famous 
outsourcing center is the Foxconn “campus” in Shenzhen where iPads, Macs, 
and iPhones are made, as well as Sony’s PlayStation 3, Amazon’s Kindle Fire, 
and the Nintendo Wii. The Taiwanese company is the major assembler for 
Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Acer, and manufactures all of the game consoles 
for Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. It employs 1.2 million Chinese, 220,000 in 
Shenzhen.22 A Frontline documentary on Walmart sums it up:
By now, many manufacturers . . . have little choice but to redefine 
themselves as “branded distributors” for overseas goods. In other 
words, instead of making their own products, they use their own 
brand names to market Chinese-made goods to retailers. They 
eke out profits by outsourcing production and marketing that 
production. The process is virtually the final step in the surrender 
to the Walmart/China joint venture.23
As a result of the Megas rush to source from China, other retailers have been 
forced to follow suit to stay competitive. The mail-order catalog company 
L.L. Bean was for decades the epitome of Yankee independence and all things 
American. In the 1990s, it was pressed by the raft of new mail-order compa-
nies that had appeared on the scene as well as price pressures from the Megas. 
By 1998, the company was ready to outsource. Chris McCormick of L.L. Bean 
said this:
I don’t want to overstate it, but we were lagging in our sourcing 
competencies. I’m guessing 60 to 70 percent of our items were 
probably sourced in the [United States] then. Maybe a little bit less 
than that but not much. What the consultants pointed out is that 
the world had moved offshore. Yes, it would be nice if we could keep 
sourcing products in the [United States] but, realistically, all those 
jobs were going offshore anyway. The competencies were leaving

this country and, from a competitive standpoint, we really had no 
choice. The quality, by the way, would be just as good if not better 
than the [United States]. So we created the sourcing department 
and gave them marching orders to improve our margins and reduce 
our cost of goods sold.24
In 2000, the outsourcing initiative resulted in $30 million in savings, making it 
a very good year for the company, McCormick said, “It wasn’t so much sales 
growth that drove the performance of that year; it was improving margins 
that improved profitability of that year.25 By 2006, only about 20 percent of 
its items were produced in the United States. Despite this decision, L.L. Bean 
still trumpets the Made in America tune by pointing out on its website that 
its factory in Brunswick, Maine, employs 450 people that “ continue to make 
iconic products such as the Maine Hunting Shoe, L.L.Bean Boots, Boat and 
Tote Bags, dog bed liners and small leather goods.” But in bragging about its 
Made in America products, the company also makes this sad point, “ We're 
one of the last multichannel US merchants to still own and operate a US 
manufacturing facility.”26
In fact, today innovators are hard-pressed to find companies in the United States 
with the ability to manufacture their products. Consider the Marshmallow Fun 
Company, which designs and sells toys that shoot spongy, sweet “marshmal-
low ammo” long distances. An article in The Wall Street Journal stated the 
following:
So far, . . . the Dallas-based company has been unable to hit one 
of its targets: making at least some of its "blasters" in the United 
States rather than relying exclusively on contract manufacturers in 
China. "I salute anybody who's making goods in the U.S.A.," said 
Beaver Raymond, chief executive of the 10-year-old toy maker, 
whose products retail for about $20 to $28, "but it isn't so easy." 
Mr. Raymond and other American entrepreneurs eager to bring 
manufacturing back to the US often run up against an obstacle: 
unlike China, the US has few contract manufacturers geared up to 
make consumer products on a large scale.27

In contrast, contract manufacturers in China can make anything. According 
to Stephen Mauer of Shanghai-based AlixPartners, “You can find a specialist in 
any product. . . . You want a toaster oven? There are a dozen contract manu-
facturers that make toaster ovens. That kind of contract manufacturing just 
doesn’t exist anyplace else.”28
Mexico: The New (Old?) China
China, India, and other Asian nations are not the only destinations for 
American companies forced into outsourcing. In recent years, wage inflation 
in China has made Mexico’s proximity more attractive. For example, auto 
workers in Mexico are paid about $26 dollars for a day’s work, one-tenth of 
their counterparts north of the border.29 Today, the average monthly income 
of a production worker in Mexico in is $353. Given the logistical challenges of 
operating in China, it is no wonder that American companies have been shift-
ing production to Mexico as Chinese wages have increased in recent years.30 
Even the Chinese themselves have moved operations to Mexico. Foxconn 
now has a manufacturing center in Ciudad Juarez that mass-produces prod-
ucts during the introduction phase as well as later stages of the product life 
cycle.31 Tremendous savings related to shipping are also being realized. For 
example, all Dell computers are manufactured at Foxconn’s location in Juarez, 
which has the capacity to ship 1 million computers a month.32
The Outsourcing Compulsion
Presently, far too many US companies view outsourcing as their only 
option when it comes to “growing” their businesses. They are locked 
out of opportunities at home because of abnormal relationships with  
Mega-Customers that not only control the delivery of their products to  
consumers, but also wield tremendous power over their internal processes. 
Cut off from the ability to control distribution and sales, these firms can grow

only by cutting costs at the other end of the value chain. They must chase the 
cheapest inputs, particularly labor, to generate adequate margins and maintain 
shareholder value.
Equally debilitating is the fact that many of the efforts manufacturers make to 
invest overseas fail miserably. Because they feel compelled to relocate some 
or all of their operations offshore, they may not accurately assess the inherent 
risks in doing business in less-developed countries. In China, for example, an 
overwhelmed infrastructure, competition for scarcer and scarcer resources, 
a government that frequently protects local interests over those of foreign 
firms, and an impending currency correction are critical elements that manu-
facturers often do not, or seemingly cannot, consider. Such factors must be 
heavily weighed when looking at overseas locations. However, the perils of 
doing business in emerging markets are often glossed over as the demands of 
the Mega-Customers compel manufacturers to embrace what appears to be 
their only strategic option.
Yes, it is a fact that American firms are being pulled overseas by the allure 
of potential profits and cheap labor. The ability to hire software engineers 
in India at less than half the cost of their American counterparts, and the 
impressive, though inexpensive, capabilities of China’s flexible manufacturing 
facilities, produce a siren-like enchantment to Western managers. The under-
lying reality remains: it is not corporate avarice that is driving large percent-
ages of manufacturing out of the United States. Nor is it the desire for the 
cheapest price on the part of consumers. This coercive push is being driven 
by something more proximate to our domestic environment than the desire 
for new markets, lower labor costs, or greater efficiencies in sourcing. What 
is forcing thousands of companies to close US operations and lay off work-
ers is the imbalance in the domestic sales and distribution model described 
in the previous chapters. The compulsive embrace of offshoring by US firms 
is not a function of internally generated goals and objectives, but is instead 
driven by the sheer demands of corporate survival for those companies in 
The Customer Trap.

Avoiding the 
Trap
Criticism simply for the sake of criticism is the purview of only a select few. 
Those who critique books, movies, plays, and restaurants, for example, do so 
knowing full well that their criticism goes only as far as their personal tastes.
In business, such an approach to criticism is anathema. If someone seeks to 
disparage a particular business practice, they should have a viable alternative. 
If they do not, they better step aside.
If the Customer Trap has taught us anything, it is that much of the thinking 
around sales and distribution is gravely flawed. Part I of this book is our  
critique. In Part II, we show how a company can avoid the Customer Trap in 
the first place.

The STIHL Story
Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.
—Mark Twain
Fred Whyte, president of US-based STIHL, speaks about the outdoor power 
equipment produced by STIHL with the same kind of care and deliberation 
you would expect from someone who was clearing trees with one of the 
firm’s legendary chain saws. He has been with the company for 42 years—the 
last 25 as president of US operations. Before that, he was the president of 
STIHL Canada for 10 years. Whyte remains a Canadian citizen, a fact con-
cealed by a Midwestern accent that avoids even the occasional “eh.” When 
we met with him, we started with this question: “Was there ever a moment 
that you were tempted to sell through the big-box stores?” He paused for a 
moment and then followed with an emphatic, “Unequivocally, no.” And then 
he said, “You can’t be all things to all people. You have to know who you are 
and what you are going to be when you grow up.”1
In the United States, STIHL markets its products through 12 regional distrib-
utors and 8,500 servicing dealers, more than 50 percent of which sell only 
STIHL-branded handheld products. You cannot buy STIHL chain saws, blowers, 
trimmers, or brush cutters at Lowe’s, The Home Depot, or Walmart. This is not 
because there have not been huge efforts to get STIHL products into the Megas. 
Sales presentations have been made, performance standards have been guaran-
teed, and huge profits have been projected. However, the efforts to strike a deal 
have been undertaken by the Megas—not STIHL. Fred Whyte states, “For quite 
a period of time, we had Lowe’s and The Home Depot representatives flying in 
here on their private planes, sitting down with us, doing their PowerPoints.”

Chapter 6 | The STIHL Story
76
The story of STIHL is a story of invention, creativity, and quality coupled 
with service, loyalty, and vision. It is the last of these, a remarkable clarity of 
vision, that has kept the firm out of the Customer Trap. The company has 
simply never given the mass-market discounters even one moment of serious 
consideration. This vision and intelligence, which pervades the company, was 
instilled by the firm’s founder from the very beginning.
Origins
Andreas Stihl liked to figure things out, to know how things worked. Born in 
Zurich in 1896 and raised by relatives in Germany, he was sent to the front 
lines in World War I, where he received severe injuries leading to a medical 
discharge in 1917. With his military service behind him, he studied mechanical 
engineering at the technical institute in Eisenach and spent three years working 
for large companies, one of which built steam engines for sawmills. It was during 
this time that he perceived a problem and began to formulate a solution that 
would revolutionize the forest products industry throughout the world.
The problem he identified was that trees had to be brought down by station-
ary saws or axes and then transported whole to sawmills before being cut up 
into manageable pieces. This required moving heavy timber over many miles. 
Working out of a small workshop, Stihl designed and built the first-ever elec-
tric chain saw in 1926—a two-man 140-pound “cross-cutting chain saw.” In 
1929, he introduced the company’s first gasoline-powered chain saw. Although 
it also required two men for operation, its portability revolutionized the wood 
products industry.
It was at this time that a particular aspect of Stihl’s personality would ensure 
decades of postwar success and ultimately would protect the company from 
mass-market retailers: Stihl truly believed in serving the customer. Employees 
were trained to instruct buyers in how to use and maintain products pur-
chased from the company. In addition, the company insisted that whoever sold 
STIHL products had to have the ability to service and repair those products. 
One early employee stated, “It won’t do to sell saws to people without teach-
ing, assisting, and offering good service to users later.”
Like any innovation, the chain saw had its share of critics. Loggers, afraid the 
new technology would put them out of work, vigorously opposed the new 
technology and even attacked STIHL’s salesmen. Stihl dealt with opposition 
through education and training. In 1937, he introduced chain-saw training 
courses at logging camps throughout Germany, and during a trip to the United 
States in 1939, he conducted seminars in power-saw technology. These efforts 
were used to overcome resistance and to introduce potential customers to 
his revolutionary new product.

The Customer Trap
77
Chain-saw training was a lengthy affair that is difficult for us to imagine today.  
A history written for the company provides the following account from 1939:
The inhabitants of health resort Langenbrand near Bad Liebenzell 
in the Black Forest were very surprised when about ten chain saws 
sputtered to life in the yard of Hotel Ochsen. It was a feast for the 
eyes of the instructors to see how the district foresters with their 
chief fellers and forest workers practiced starting the chain saws 
and sometimes opened the throttle far more than necessary. There 
were one or two very funny incidents during the first exercise, 
i.e., starting and cross-cutting, which showed the men were really 
children at heart.
From the second day of the course, the participants sang their way 
into the woods, where they were able to practice felling and bucking 
as long as they wanted. In this process, some of the men were so 
enthusiastic that they forgot that their colleagues also wanted to try 
out the machines and learn something.
The chief forester in charge, who came into the woods every day 
on horseback with his head held high, took the course participants 
under his wing and looked after them. The course continued 
with lectures, explanations, and practical work until its successful 
conclusion was celebrated in a festive mood on Friday evening. 
Chief state forester Evers and Mr. Stihl, with several gentlemen 
from the company, joined them, and the foundation for more chain-
saw training courses was laid while talking shop, telling jokes, and 
drinking beer. It should be mentioned that two pigs were slaughtered 
to provide food aplenty for all. Saturday after lunch, the course 
participants proudly and happily set off home with new energy and 
the machines they had bought.2
During this time, Stihl continued to improve his saw, creating a lighter weight 
and more reliable product.
Allied bombing raids during World War II destroyed the STIHL manufac-
turing facilities in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt , and production was relocated to 
Waiblingen. In 1945, Stihl was arrested by French troops and turned over to 
the Americans. Like all of Europe, the company languished during the immedi-
ate postwar period, but by 1948, Stihl was released from custody and eventu-
ally returned to the helm of his enterprise.

2006), p. 26.

Chapter 6 | The STIHL Story
78
The major breakthrough for the company occurred in 1950, when STIHL 
introduced the first one-man saw. An improved version brought to market 
in 1954, at 31 pounds, was the first chain saw that was truly portable. New 
products and innovations followed, including the Contra introduced in 1959 
(with its direct drive and diaphragm carburetor) and a saw with an antivibra-
tion system in 1965. Constant improvement and innovation characterized the 
company’s products throughout the period.
STIHL’s innovations stimulated demand for chain saws and, between 1963 
and 1965, output doubled from 65,000 to 130,000 saws. By this time, the 
business had 50 percent of the German market share and a 16 percent share 
worldwide. Within a decade, the company’s 2,000 employees were producing 
340,000 saws annually.
Andreas Stihl died in 1973 at the age of 76. Despite two world wars, raging 
inflation, crippling poverty, tough competition, and many other obstacles, the 
inventive mechanical engineer had managed to build a company with 2,500 
employees producing the world’s leading brand of chain saw. The following 
year, STIHL opened a 20,000-square-foot facility in Virginia Beach operated by 
fewer than 50 employees to facilitate its exports into the US market.
By 1960, Stihl’s four children had become limited partners in the company, and 
because of careful planning, the transition to new leadership went smoothly. 
Hans Peter Stihl was designated as the successor to Andreas in 1972. The 
company weathered the economic slump of the 1970s and the global reces-
sion of the 1980s. In 1986, it began to offer complementary products, including 
safety glasses, gloves, boots, helmets, and hearing protectors. New products 
were also introduced, including trimmers and leaf blowers, as well as special-
ized clearing saws.
Until the 1990s, STIHL produced chain saws strictly for professional use in the 
forest and lumber industries. This left 50 percent of the market untouched by 
the company. Ongoing innovations, including design innovations that reduced 
the weight of the product to 20 pounds, prompted the company to move 
aggressively into the small-saw market. In 1994, STIHL shifted the production 
of all small saws to the United States and, as of 2014, the Virginia Beach opera-
tion consisted of a manufacturing and administrative facility of more than 
1 million square feet, with approximately 2,100 employees. In 1973, another 
manufacturing facility was established in Brazil. A sales office was set up in 
China in 1995, followed by manufacturing operations in 2005.
STIHL became the market leader in the chain-saw segment in 1992, eclipsing 
both Homelite and the McCulloch Corporation. The STIHL Group today 
employs more than 13,800 people around the world and manufactures more 
than 275 model variations of chain saws, trimmers, leaf blowers, mini cultivators, 
and other related products.

The Customer Trap

In a 2008 speech given to employees of one of its American regional 
distributors (Bryan Equipment Sales in Loveland, Ohio), Hans Peter Stihl attributed 
the success of the company to four strategies:
First, product innovation and quality. This is the lifeblood of any 
manufacturing concern. This is especially true for STIHL because of the 
high expectations our customers have for our products. Whether it 
is the introduction of new engine technologies that lead our industry 
by meeting or exceeding strict Environmental Protection Agency 
emission standards, or the advanced manufacturing processes that 
you will find in our Virginia Beach facilities, our customers ultimately 
experience dynamic products and features that are the hallmark of 
our brand.
Second, the high level of in-house production. Unlike many other 
companies, we have not increased our outsourcing of component 
manufacturing. Actually, we have taken additional processes in-house 
to maximize quality while minimizing material cost increases and 
achieving delivery deadlines.
Third, establishing an international manufacturing network. As you 
are aware, products produced at STIHL Incorporated are distributed 
across North America and shipped to (more than 90) different 
countries around the world. A significant portion of the annual 
production at Virginia Beach is for the export market, and STIHL 
Incorporated can be proud of its achievements in this regard.
Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the success of STIHL is 
based on unique marketing strategies. Virtually all of our primary 
competitors have compromised their retail distribution strategies 
to accommodate mass merchants and home centers. While this 
approach may offer some near-term advantages by way of increased 
sales distribution, the long-term effect can be a loss of identity and 
competitive uniqueness. This is not the STIHL way. Instead, we rely 
on our distribution associates, like Bryan Equipment Sales, to build 
and maintain relationships with our servicing dealers who serve our 
customers. And, like STIHL, Bryan Equipment is family owned, and 
I am pleased to now see the third generation of the Bryan family 
entering into the leadership position within this highly successful 
organization.3

Service
Further into the preceding speech, Hans Peter Stihl summed up the company’s 
service philosophy: “These big boxes are not able to give service. . . . No ser-
vice, no sale.” Fred Whyte, president of the US-based STIHL, said that STIHL 
has never been tempted to sell to the Megas because service was a key ingre-
dient of the value proposition from the beginning. “Who likes to buy a new 
car without driving it around the block?” he asked. “The first challenge for 
STIHL dealers is to explain why their chain saws may sometimes cost $50 to 
$100 more than those of competitors.” A price-based shopper—and most 
Americans are fixated on price—will not know that a STIHL chain saw has a 
unique chain brake, a higher-grade chain, an automatic gear-driven oiler, and 
a chrome-impregnated cylinder with superior heat-transfer capabilities and 
greater durability. A knowledgeable salesperson is required to communicate 
the superior quality of STIHL products. According to Eric Bolling, the manager 
of a STIHL dealership in Virginia, a customer will buy a higher-quality product 
that costs more, “if you can actually show the person what they’re paying for.”
STIHL dealers “qualify” customers by asking a series of questions so that they 
can make sure that they get the right product into the customer’s hands. They 
instruct buyers in how to properly use and maintain the equipment they sell, 
and they offer protective clothing, such as chain-saw protective chaps, and eye 
and hearing protectors. STIHL’s effort to get protective gear into customers’ 
hands is not just a matter of “plus-selling.” Although no one knows for sure, 
estimates are that around 20,000 accidents a year occur involving chain saws. 
In an article published in The Wall Street Journal, reporter Gwendolyn Bounds 
stated that she “discovered finding critical safety equipment at some big-box 
retailers can be hit or miss. The Home Depot and Sears, for example, carry 
some eight brands of saws between them, but spokespeople for both stores 
say that chaps aren’t an item they choose to stock at this time. Lowe’s, by con-
trast, does stock chaps and offers dedicated how-to-clinics in regions where 
chain saws are in high demand.”4
STIHL dealers also operate full service centers at their retail stores. The goal 
is to establish a relationship with customers while making a “complete sale.” 
By providing a dealer who is an expert, the customer not only is prepared to 
properly operate what can be a dangerous piece of machinery, but also can 
view the dealer as the authority when it comes to ancillary products, whether 
or not they are produced by STIHL (for example, lawn mowers, garden trac-
tors, fertilizers, and so on).

February 4, 2006, p. 5.

The Customer Trap
81
It has never made sense at STIHL for a premium piece of machinery to be sold 
in a box without interaction with the customer. For this reason, you cannot 
buy a product from STIHL on the Internet and have it shipped to your home. 
STIHL in the United States, however, has shortened the shopping convenience 
bridge between its dealers and prospects via its online shopping program, 
STIHL Express. Through this program, a customer can reserve a STIHL prod-
uct online and then pick it up at the dealer, who can provide expert advice and 
a fully assembled product, fueled and ready to go. According to the company, 
selling unassembled products that come in a box, with little or no protective 
equipment, and without a reliable dealer who can knowledgeably service the 
product is the opposite of building a relationship with a customer and is con-
trary to the STIHL business model. The nonservice sales approach ultimately 
results in low profitability over time.
The Dealer’s Perspective
STIHL believes that its dealers are the lifeblood of the company and that the 
most critical point in its distribution channel is the counter space bringing 
servicing dealers to their customers. For decades, a conscious effort has been 
made to help dealers understand that they are a vital part of the firm’s opera-
tions. An internal company history records the approach that STIHL has taken 
with its dealers:
“Groups of dealers from all over the world are regularly invited to 
[the] head office, so that we could show them our factory and they 
could see how STIHL saws are made,” explains Reinhold Guhl. In 
the evenings, Andreas Stihl, while he was still healthy, as well as Hans 
Peter Stihl, the export boss, and a number of other staff sit down 
with the dealers to talk things over in a relaxed atmosphere.
Two things are very important at the meetings, stresses Guhl. First, it 
is necessary to keep underscoring the company’s loyalty to servicing 
dealers because many of them fear that STIHL, as it grows in size, 
might terminate their agreements at some time. After all, the main 
competitors switched from specialist dealers to the big chains during 
the eighties and thereafter.
Second, the photo session is an important part of the meeting with 
independent dealers. Everyone has a photograph taken with Stihl 
senior or junior, or both. The pictures are meticulously set up by 
the company’s photographers, with warm handshakes and friendly 
smiles all around.

Chapter 6 | The STIHL Story
82
Such pictures are soon hanging on the walls of showrooms all over 
the world. And dealers point out proudly: “As you can see, I know 
Mr. Stihl personally. I visited the place where the STIHL saws are 
built.” And long stories are probably told in many places about the 
great factory and the pleasant evening spent drinking Swabian wine 
with “my friends Andreas and Hans Peter” and many others. This 
very personal approach in taking care of independent dealers is 
largely responsible for the good reputation of the company and the 
Stihl family among servicing dealers.5
STIHL dealers are nearly uniform in their praise of the company. Billings 
Hardware sits at the far end of Grand Avenue in Billings, Montana. If you 
walk in the front door and make an immediate turn to the left, you will 
see a huge display of STIHL products. Dan Thomas, a soft-spoken, articu-
late man who looks like he is in his mid-50s, is in charge of service at the 
store. “I’ve been in outdoor power equipment since 1979, and I’ve owned 
two dealerships of my own. I’ve worked at almost every level—including 
manufacturer’s representative, service technician, sales, and management. 
I’ve done everything there is to do in this industry.” Between fielding phone 
calls, Thomas explained that the industry has changed dramatically since he 
was in business with his father in the 1980s. “A lot of manufacturers were 
enticed by big chains and big-box stores to increase their numbers as far as 
sales go. That changed the industry—probably forever. A lot of manufactur-
ers did not survive.”6
One consequence of manufacturers moving toward the big-box stores was 
that they lost their relationship with independent dealers. The dealers could 
not compete with the price points offered by the Megas, so they discon-
tinued the product lines that had been introduced in the big-box stores 
and sought out high-end manufacturers. Without the independent dealers, 
no one was around to service or repair units that had been sold. Thomas 
pointed out that there are exceptions. In Billings, Husqvarna equipment, 
which is sold at Lowe’s, can be serviced at some Big R stores. But if you buy 
a Homelite or Poulan chain saw, “You are on your own.” For purchasers,

83
product reliability is a hit-or-miss proposition. Thomas described the quality 
issue in this way:
The outdoor power equipment that’s carried in big chains is generally 
not as good or as high quality as that carried by the independent 
dealer. That’s strictly because the mass merchants want to market 
something at a lower price. Before the mass merchants became 
predominant in power equipment, most manufacturers had some 
good products. Once the manufacturers started getting into great 
big numbers, their quality went down for two reasons. First, they 
had to produce more units much more quickly. Second, the retail 
outlets were demanding a much less expensive unit, so they put 
less quality into it and cut corners in their manufacturing. At least 
as far as chain saws go, [Names three brands] were all fairly decent 
manufacturers back before that huge change in the industry. All of 
those units in this market are now of lower quality and are sold on 
the basis of price.
STIHL is viewed positively by Thomas. He stated that the company has a very 
good brand name and a high-quality product that is “the best-quality machine 
on the market right now.” Husqvarna and ECHO are two other nation-
ally known brands that Thomas considers to be “the next best machines.” 
However, when they are purchased at the Megas, customers may or may 
not end up with a product that is appropriate for a particular job. Thomas 
explained his approach:
The first thing I want to do is ask the customer what he is going to 
use the unit for and how he is going to use it. The worst thing you 
can do is sell somebody a piece of equipment that’s not heavy-duty 
enough to do the job. He simply will not get satisfaction out of that 
machine. That is true for every line of equipment that is sold. You 
must get the customer to buy the unit that he wants to use in a 
certain application.
Thomas has the highest level of technical training offered by STIHL, which 
he acquired at the company’s manufacturing facility in Virginia. He observed, 
“Big-box stores generally do not have qualified sales people on the floor that 
can help customers. There are some individuals who have some knowledge in 
those places, but not very many.”
An entry on Arboristsite.com is representative of the perspective of 
many dealers:
My distributor was Mid-Atlantic STIHL in Hillsborough, NC. Never have I 
dealt with a finer organization—their customer service was excellent and 
their parts fill rate was even better . . . STIHL suggests a retail price—that 

Chapter 6 | The STIHL Story
84
allows a dealer to make a certain amount of profit—but a dealer is free to sell 
for more or less. I always sold parts and whole goods for retail price (certain 
exceptions were made for high volume sales customers.) . . . Dealer profit is 
essential—otherwise there won’t be any dealers. STIHL also has no minimum-
order policies. There are incentives such as a minimum size order (it used to 
be $2,500 but may be higher now) to get free freight.  . . . Many times, a cus-
tomer needed a part …STIHL would ship it that same day and I’d sell it and 
pass along the freight. Customer and dealer happy.”7
This testimonial demonstrates the kind of respect that STIHL has for it servic-
ing-dealers. Fundamentally, the company understands that its business involves 
more than manufacturing the best outdoor power equipment in the world. It 
understands that small business owners and individual technicians operating 
across the globe are the key to its success.
Avoiding the Customer Trap
Peter Burton, STIHL’s former vice president of marketing and sales, said, “The 
category killers are tempting. It’s easy to get caught up in the adrenaline rush 
when they come calling. The kind of volume they say they can deliver, it’s huge.”  
The mass-discounter temptation is tempered by STIHL’s vision of its place in the 
market and by an awareness of what happens to companies when they do 
business with the Megas. The downward spiral caused by the Customer Trap is 
well understood at STIHL. President Whyte presented it as a kind of parable:
The big-box store people say, “Andrew, you are our most important 
supplier; a great guy, and we love you to death, and this is a fantastic 
product you have been giving us.” So what does Andrew do? He goes 
home, sits down with his wife and says, “Honey, I added a Mega account; 
we’re on easy street now. We’re going to buy that new boat, and we 
get to buy the bigger house, and we get the Mercedes.” Andrew then 
hires 20 people and builds a new building. The second year, Andrew 
comes back and sits down with his customer, and the same scenario 
is repeated, “Andrew, you’re one of our preeminent suppliers, but we 
are going to have to double our volume with you this year with such 
a successful product.” Andrew goes home, sits down with the wife. 
He gets a bigger boat, he buys a bigger house, he hires more people, 
he obtains more machinery, he buys bigger buildings. The third year, 
Andrew sits down with his Mega-Customer, who says, “Andrew we’ve 
had a great relationship with you, we love you to death, but this guy

85
product for half the price.” Now, what is Andrew going to do? Andrew 
doesn’t go home and tell his wife he’s selling the boat and laying people 
off. No, he looks at his chain saw and says, well, you know, we don’t 
have to put chrome on that chain, we don’t have to put ball bearings in 
the engines, we could put in bushings, instead. We don’t need a gear-
driven automatic oiler, we can put in one that takes a little pressure 
off the crank case that’s manual. And those antivibration mounts, well, 
we can just put a bushing in there too. So over time, the quality of 
the product becomes eroded to meet a price; then you know what 
happens to the brand after that.
Whyte’s parable is not idle talk. He watched it unfold with his company’s 
once-great competitors. McCulloch Motors Corporation, founded in 1943, 
produced chain saws that were lighter than STIHL’s through an assembly-
line process that was, at the time, more advanced than the German firm’s. 
Renamed McCulloch Corporation, it began to sell through J.C. Penney in the 
1970s and was subsequently acquired by Black & Decker in 1988. Black & 
Decker had also pursued the mass market, and so diminished their brand 
image in the eyes of professional contractors, such that they had to reinvent 
their brand with the launching of DeWALT in 1992.
Today McCulloch is owned by Husqvarna, having passed through the hands 
of Jenn Feng Industrial Co. after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999. 
Jenn Feng paid a mere $7.5 million for its share of the company in 1999, in 
part because McCulloch had stopped supplying tools two years before, and 
its market share had been taken over by the competition. David Jong, the 
chief executive officer of the Jenn Feng Group, said that the company’s initial 
strategy was to use the McCulloch brand to market its portfolio of lawn care 
products through The Home Depot, Kmart, Lowe’s, and Sears. He said that 
when they first acquired the company, they thought that America’s huge retail-
ers would help them quickly boost market share. That did not happen, and 
McCulloch’s share remained small even after two years of aggressively pushing 
the brand to the Megas. Why did the strategy fail? Jong explained it this way:
You can’t count on huge retailers to help you realize your dream 
because they have so many suppliers and usually pick a few big players 
as their long-term sources. If you are not one of their favored suppliers, 
they only buy in small quantities from you, and when your products 
sell out, you often find that the shelf space has been given over to the 
products of your rivals. Most of all, they shop for price, so there is constant 
pressure to discount. Or they import products from your rivals.8

In 2003, Jenn Feng stopped dealing with the Megas, and, instead, according to 
Jong, intended to focus on supplying gas engines for handheld garden tools for 
US-based MTD Products. In 2008, Jenn Feng was acquired by Husqvarna.
A similar fate befell Homelite, which, when it was a division of Textron, ramped 
up sales on the mass market. By 1978, it had sold 1 million chain saws in a 
12-month period. The company was sold to John Deere in 1994 and sold 
again in 2001 to the Hong Kong firm Techtronic Industries after losing $70 
million in 2000 and $30 million in the first nine months of 2001. Ken Golden, 
the public relations manager at the time, stated, “Despite the very best efforts 
of many employees, Homelite has not been profitable.”9 Homelite chain saws 
are now available only at The Home Depot. The Homelite website promi-
nently features a product recall required by the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. If you Google Homelite, you will be bombarded with consumer 
complaints and recall information.
Speaking to business students at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management, 
STIHL’s former vice president of sales and marketing, Peter Burton, summa-
rized the problem with the Megas:
The big boxes are . . . intimidating. They dictate guarantees and shift 
costly operational activities off their own backs and onto suppliers. 
And they expect their suppliers not just to hold down their prices 
but to consistently drop them annually. In short, the supplier 
is left helpless and increasingly profitless. If you sleep beside the 
8,000-pound gorilla, you don’t want to be caught underneath when 
it rolls over.10
The management of STIHL views selling to the Megas as a “vicious circle.” 
Firms are forced to lower their prices to be competitive and then reduce 
costs to remain profitable, which in turn leads to diminished product quality, 
and, ultimately, a brand that has been tarnished, sometimes irreparably. Hans 
Peter Stihl stated, “We remain true to our distribution philosophy of selling 
exclusively through servicing dealers because mass merchandisers are not in 
a position to provide optimal advice and handle technical service and parts 
support.11

The Advertising Campaign
STIHL not only eschews the Megas, but also lets the world know about it. 
In 2006, it began placing some very provocative ads in The Wall Street Journal, 
USA Today, The New York Times, and other national, regional, and local news-
papers. A picture of a STIHL chain saw sits under the caption, “Why is the 
world’s number one selling brand of chain saw not sold at Lowe’s or The 
Home Depot?” Another ad reads, “Why it is that some Father’s Day gifts 
can’t be found in a big box?” Explanations of the service and maintenance 
aspects follow in smaller print. The ads were intended not only to reinforce 
the “aura of exclusivity” that surrounds STIHL products but also to educate 
potential buyers about where they might find STIHL products. Research con-
ducted by STIHL had indicated that more than 50 percent of survey respon-
dents thought that the company’s products could be purchased at Lowe’s and 
The Home Depot. Whyte explained, “Generation X and Generation Y visit 
Home Depot and expect to be able to find everything there.” Indeed, the 
local gas station has disappeared from small-town America as has the corner 
grocery store. The appliance stores that used to be front and center in small-
town America have been replaced with the likes of tattoo parlors, T-shirt 
shops, and boutiques specializing in hemp. The younger generations, having 
no memory of local, specialty stores, think that everything can be found in the 
big-box stores. STIHL’s advertising campaign has been aimed at undermining 
this perspective.
The impetus behind the Journal ads came from the company’s dealers, who 
began to constantly challenge the corporation’s stated commitment to sell 
only through the dealer service network. The thinking was simple: everybody 
sells through The Home Depot, so of course STIHL would eventually sell 
there as well. The idea for full-page ads came to Fred Whyte over a beer with 
Peter Burton. “We decided that we were going to put our dedication to our 
servicing dealers in print. We swallowed really hard, but we knew it was the 
right thing to do.” Hans Peter Stihl liked the idea. “You can put it in print,” he 
said. “As long as I own the company, we will only sell to servicing dealers.”
STIHL’s marketing efforts, as illustrated in Figure 6-1, have engendered tre-
mendous enthusiasm from its dealer network. The campaign caused a stir 
when the ads initially appeared in the The Wall Street Journal. When asked 
about the ads, The Home Depot spokesperson, Jean Osta Niemi, said, “Those 
vendors who are selling their products at The Home Depot realize the ben-
efit of 2,060 store locations and 1.3 billion customer transactions a year, and 
they, too, are committed to providing the best product at the best value.” 
Ravjiv Lal, a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in retailing, 
was paraphrased in the same article as saying that it was a risky strategy 
because it implied that consumers who shop at big-box stores do not appre-
ciate quality. “You can offend a bunch of people,” he said, “but those probably 

Chapter 6 | The STIHL Story
88
aren’t your customers anyway.” STIHL has become enormously successful by 
ignoring these kinds of suggestions while sticking to its core vision of quality 
and customer service.12

Seeking Out New Retailers
STIHL has not spurned all of the companies that have approached them. In 
July 2008, the manufacturer reached an agreement with John Deere, which 
made it the preferred provider of handheld power equipment at Deere deal-
ers across the United States and Canada. Executives at STIHL “thought long 
and hard” when John Deere informed them that it had decided to exit the 
handheld market. Deere proposed that STIHL become the preferred brand 
of handheld products offered through Deere’s network of dealers. “It was the 
first time a nongreen product went into the Deere stores with the blessing of 
their corporate office,” said Whyte. He continued:
They are a very well-recognized, national brand. They were obviously 
going to sell some kind of handheld product, so it was pretty amazing 
when they came to us and said, “Look, we have exited the handheld 
market, and you guys have been so successful that we want you to 
fill the void.”
The complementary nature of the products sold through John Deere makes this 
distribution arrangement particularly attractive. Deere sells a variety of con-
sumer and professional lawn and garden products, as well as tractors and heavy 
equipment used on farms and ranches, and STIHL does not compete with John 
Deere in any major product category now that Deere has exited the handheld 
category.13 The relationship between the two remains strong and sound today.
While the deal with John Deere expands the reach of STIHL, distributing 
through suppliers of farm and power equipment is still somewhat limiting. 
Many people simply do not place themselves in that kind of environment. One 
of the reasons that The Home Depot and Lowe’s have been so successful is 
that they reinvented the hardware store and lumberyard categories. For many 
people, going to the lumber store or hardware store was a less-than-pleasant 
shopping experience. Employees who were great at cutting boards and mixing 
paint were often socially ill equipped to deal with people who did not know 
much about fixing things. Such customers often felt foolish in the lumberyard 
environment. As much as anything, this created the multi-billion-dollar do-it-
yourself home improvement category. STIHL executives recognize that many 
potential customers simply will not walk into the metallic atmosphere of a 
tractor of power equipment store. This, plus the proliferation of mass dis-
counters, has pushed STIHL to continually search for new distribution oppor-
tunities that fit with its service and maintenance philosophy.
13Information about the John Deere-STIHL deal was obtained from “John Deere and 
STIHL Announce Agreement to Expand Retail Relationships” (STIHL press release),  
July 29, 2008, and “John Deere & STIHL, Reach Handheld Equipment Deals,”  
August 2008, available at www.landscapemanagement.net.

STIHL executives see hardware stores as a natural outlet for its products. 
Whyte especially likes Ace Hardware, Do It Best, and True Value.
They are good business people, generally located in metropolitan 
areas, on nice pieces of real estate. They are open longer hours, 
whereas our traditional retailer is not open on Sunday and closes at 
six o’clock during the week. These stores are convenient. Ace, True 
Value, and Do It Best people are pretty sophisticated. They have 
shown their retailers that the average sale per square foot for STIHL 
products is something like 10 times what they are accustomed to in 
their stores. This is because they are selling a premium product. Even 
though they have access through their national buying programs for 
items made by Poulan and Weed Eater, the hardware owner also 
wants to be able to offer a premium product. We added dozens of 
Ace dealers in the last year. That is some very significant business. 
Again, the point is to segment potential customers—the customer 
who is more comfortable in that retail environment than going into 
a power equipment shop or even a John Deere dealership.
STIHL continues to look for opportunities to expand its distribution through-
out North America and around the world. It is amenable to evaluating options 
when it comes to getting its products into the hands of customers. However, 
it is uninterested in the Megas or in branding the products to be sold under a 
different name. In the early 1990s, STIHL acquired VIKING, a European com-
pany started in 1984 that manufactures lawn mowers and garden equipment. 
You will not buy one of these lawn mowers in the United States because 
80 percent of the walk-behind lawn mowers are sold through the big boxes. 
STIHL refused to allow its products to become commoditized, even when 
those products are sold under a completely different brand name.
Several years ago, as Fred Whyte got on a plane after attending a trade con-
ference in San Diego, the chief executive of a well-known national brand that 
competes with STIHL turned to him and said, “Well, the good news is that 
I’m on my way to Atlanta to see my biggest customer, and the bad news is 
that I’m on my way to Atlanta to see my biggest customer.” Because STIHL is 
determined to control the destiny of its products, its executives do not have 
to face this good news/bad news scenario.
While STIHL is one of the best examples of avoiding the Customer Trap, 
other companies have stayed clear of this mistake as well. Let’s see next how 
some of them maintain control over their innovations.

Innovation’s 
Second Step
Things are not always what they seem; the first appearance deceives 
many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.
—Phaedrus, Roman poet
According to the textbooks, sales and distribution should be approached from 
the perspective of customer needs.1 An individual or company simply wants 
the product to be available at a certain time and place, in the correct quantity 
and at the right price.2 While unassailable from the customer’s point of view, 
this perspective ignores the interests of innovating companies, which often 
conflict with those of the customer, particularly as innovators move through 
the vulnerable scaling-up process and the “customer” becomes more than  
10 percent of total revenue.
The problem is that smaller, innovative firms are particularly vulnerable to 
the unidirectional power of large Mega-Customers. Rapid growth for many 
smaller businesses often takes place when they “make it big” by entering into 
a deal with large-scale customers. Small companies typically have a limited 
number of resources. As a result, pressure to fill huge orders can quickly 
become unmanageable because Mega-Customers require products that abso-
lutely must be delivered according to specifications and absolutely on time.

Referring to company operations, former Office Depot Vice President Scott 
Koerner states, “We have a machine that operates with every element ­needing 
to work like clockwork for us to be effective. I’ve seen a lot of small compa-
nies grow quickly who can’t meet that challenge.”3
For many suppliers, the time needed for new product development and ongo-
ing service to existing accounts is sacrificed to the endless paperwork and 
negotiations that make up the fabric of managing Mega-Customers. This is 
what happened to our student Sam and his landscaping business. He became 
so fixated on serving the needs of his Mega-Customer that he didn’t have any 
more time for his other clients.
Often the process of scaling up has more to do with the urgency of the 
moment than it does with strategic decision making. As a result, sales and 
distribution channels tend to develop in an ad hoc manner. When a Mega-
Customer takes on an innovative product, the product “takes off,” and 
the producing firm is left scurrying to keep up with new demand and the  
day-to-day managerial challenge of meeting that demand. Such urgency leaves  
producers vulnerable to the long-term strategies of their “partners” who  
have the experience, knowledge, and strategic vision needed to dominate 
enthusiastic but resource-constrained innovators.
The power of Mega-Customers has been enhanced by the onset of the 
Internet. High costs are no longer associated with communicating, gather-
ing information, and accomplishing transactions. Mega-Customers can demand 
that their suppliers are transparent in their operations because technology 
has made transparency easy and relatively cheap. As Michael Porter states, 
“Internet technology provides buyers with easier access to information about 
products and suppliers, thus bolstering buyer bargaining power.”4
Ultimately, innovative companies can face the problem of Mega-Customers 
who are able to capture a great deal of the value of the innovated product 
while forcing changes in the innovator’s operations, value chain, and prod-
uct. At the same time, the innovative company risks alienating its traditional  
distributors, stores, or other channel members. In addition, innovative com-
panies are often driven to outsourcing production offshore in order to lower 
costs so that they can meet the price points of their retail partners.

Model of Innovator/Distributor Relationship 
Empirical research suggests that from the perspective of channel members, 
the goal is to establish channels that maximize cooperation and customer 
satisfaction, while at the same time minimizing conflict. By eliminating ineffi-
ciencies in sales and distribution, and by focusing on the customer, an optimal 
path to the market can be achieved. However, in reality, channel members 
exist within the context of power relationships.
Power is defined as the ability of one channel participant to change the behavior 
of another channel member. Power can be positive, as is the case when one 
firm has a legitimate (legal) right to tell another firm what to do, or negative, 
as when a firm uses its advantage to coerce or manipulate another firm. An 
example of the latter case would be “fines” levied by Mega-Customers for 
product-labeling mistakes and shipment errors, or demands for free samples.5
As explained in Part I of the book, the general consensus and empirical ­evidence 
suggests that over the course of the past several decades, bargaining power 
has shifted from suppliers to buyers. This took place as producers abandoned 
vertical integration in favor of focusing on their internal core competencies.6 
The increased concentration of channel structures has adverse effects on  
suppliers’ profitability. All the elements underlying buyers’ power in Porter’ 
five forces model—enhanced bargaining power, more-knowledgeable buyers, 
and credible threats of backward integration—favor the intermediaries or 
end buyers.7
Sources of Power for the Megas
Figure  7-1 displays the power configurations that provide the context for

the sources of power for the Mega consist of the scale or size of the distribu-
tors, access to markets, and legal or institutional constraints.

Scale
The most obvious, and perhaps the most determinative, variable in the 
power structure is the comparative scale of the producer and the distributor. 
Historically, big companies (with a few notable exceptions) have been able to 
dictate terms to retailers. With the rise of the Megas, few producers are in a 
position to stand on equal footing. As has been pointed out, not only are the 
large retailers able to cut into the margins of the producing company through 
systematic and forced renegotiations over pricing, but they are also able to 
shift the cost of traditional retailing activities onto manufacturers.
One of the most effective methods of managing suppliers is through what are 
called “category captains.” Large retailers have learned that they can maximize 
their advantage by selecting a major supplier to manage a category of prod-
ucts—including those of competitors—so that the category maximizes the 
Mega’s profitability. A category captain typically manages the merchandising 
of an aisle or section of the store and provides the retailer with information 
on category sales and trends, planning and merchandising advice, and sugges-
tions for shelf space allotment. The captain’s ideas are only recommendations, 
but they are taken seriously by retailers who cannot possibly have the same 
level of expertise as the category captain. Because category captains manage 
products other than those they produce, they must work closely with com-
petitors.9 As Barry C. Lynn put it in an article in Harpers:
One obvious result is that a producer like Colgate-Palmolive will 
end up working intensively with firms it formerly competed with, 
such as Crest manufacturer P&G, to find the mix of products that 
will allow Walmart to earn the most it can from its shelf space.  
If Walmart discovers that a supplier promotes its own product at 
the expense of Walmart’s revenue, the retailer may name a new 
captain in its stead.10

Clearly, size and scale have their privileges, especially for distributors.
Markets
By definition, Megas have access to large numbers of customers, and as a 
result, they control access to markets. A series of articles in the The Wall 
Street Journal recount the impressive innovation of Colin Roche, the founder 
of PenAgain, who came up with a quirky wishbone-shaped pen design as a 
high school student in Palo Alto, California.11 In 2001 he and a friend, Bobby 
Ronsee, contributed $5,000 each to form Pacific Writing Instruments, filed a 
patent, set up production, and put up a web site. The partners wanted to sell 
their pen on the mass market, but learned that in order to break into the big-
box stores, they would first need to prove the value of their product among 
smaller retailers.
One early distributor was Fred Ebert, the owner of Edwards Luggage,  
who liked the pens and began to sell them at $12.95 each. Soon larger cus-
tomers were on board, including Fred Myer and Hobby Lobby, as well as 
200 Staples stores in Canada and 5,000 independent office-supply stores. By 
September 2005, PenAgain had sold 1.2 million units in Europe and had about 
$5,000 in web sales each month.
Roche and Ronsee were not satisfied with the dramatic development of their 
company. They were committed to making PenAgain a mass-market phenom-
enon. This meant that they needed to lower their costs and create economies 
of scale in order to be able to offer a low price to the mega-distributors that 
they planned to court. With financial backing from outside investors, Roche 
and Ronsee contracted with manufacturers in China. This allowed them to 
reduce the retail price on one model to $3.99.
Eventually, the PenAgain founders sat before a Walmart buyer in a small  
conference room in Bentonville. Ten months later, they received word that 
their supplier agreement was officially approved. Walmart would carry the 
pen in 500 stores for six weeks. PenAgain was expected to sell at least  
85 percent of the product in order to receive permanent shelf space. The trial 
period with Walmart was deemed a success, and a reorder was issued.

Hearing this news, Office Depot requested an expedited shipment of pens for 
all of its 1,049 stores. To fill the order, the partners had pens flown in from 
China, rather than having them transported by boat, the less-expensive and 
slower method. Home Depot sold the pens for $3.99, while Walmart priced 
them at $3.76. Surely, PenAgain now had market reach far beyond what would 
have been possible if the company had stuck with its independent distributors 
and online sales.
Success in entering the mass market presented the partners with several new 
challenges. First, the managers of their traditional “bread-and-butter retail 
accounts” were distressed to learn of the favorable pricing given to the Mega-
Customers when they had been selling the pen for a premium price of over 
$7.00. Second, the Walmart placement created demand for the pen from 
other mass retailers. For example, in mid-July a call came in from the US 
drugstore chain Walgreens asking for 470,000 pens in time for the back-to-
school rush. The challenge was to get half a million pens shipped from China 
while still filling the current orders of other customers. They accomplished 
this by delaying several orders for pens with special logos and bumping a large 
account for a client in Europe.
Third, the payment terms demanded by the Mega-Customers placed enor-
mous stress on the firm’s limited finances. To secure orders of 50,000 or 
more from the Chinese factory, the company was required to pay 30 percent 
up front, and the balance within 30 days of receipt of the goods. This placed 
them in a bind because the Megas typically don’t pay their vendors until sev-
eral months after receipt of goods. The partners addressed this concern by 
bringing a purchase-order financing company on board, which pays up-front 
costs in exchange for a hefty portion of the profits. Fourth, during this entire 
process the PenAgain staff consisted of the two founders, two full-time work-
ers, and a handful of part-timers. There simply were not enough people to 
take care of all of the business that was pouring in.
In 2009, the international rights and patents for PenAgain were purchased by 
Propel-r Innovations. Company founder and director Aryeh Elbaz has this to 
say about the market power of the large-scale retailers:
I think some entrepreneurs view big box the same way an actor 
views big Hollywood studios . . . the biggest stage for their art 
and the ticket to “success.” These big-box stores wield so much 
leverage that entrepreneurs form their business model around their 
demands rather than around their end users. It’s a dangerous play 
that escalates quickly and goes past the point of no return before 
anyone realizes it. Just my opinion.12

But it’s not only small innovators that are drawn to the market reach of the 
Megas; large firms are also attracted to the market power that the big retailers 
exhibit. Levi Strauss & Co., Goodyear, Proctor & Gamble, and the other firms 
discussed in this book all altered major components of their respective value 
chains in order to be able to sell through the mass discounters. The reach 
of the large-scale distributors is phenomenal, and their ability to capitalize on 
that reach is breathtaking.
Legal Context
The legal and regulatory environment places constraints on the relation-
ships formed between producers and the Megas. Power was concentrated in 
the hands of producers for many years, but the legal environment eventually 
shifted so that today it favors distributors. A modest shift back toward manu-
facturers has only recently taken place.
One of the most obvious (and detrimental) placements of regulatory power 
is in the automobile industry. The Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act of 
1956 and subsequent franchise laws have made it nearly impossible for auto-
makers to manage how their cars were sold. The act reads as follows:
An automobile dealer may bring suit against any automobile 
manufacturer engaged in commerce, in any district court of the 
United States in the district in which said manufacturer resides, 
or is found, or has an agent, without respect to the amount in 
controversy, and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the 
cost of suit by reason of the failure of said automobile manufacturer 
from and after August, 8, 1956, to act in good faith in performing or 
complying with any of the terms or provisions of the franchise, or 
in terminating, cancelling, or not renewing the franchise with said 
dealer. Provided that in any such suit the manufacturer shall not be 
barred from asserting in defense of any such action the failure of the 
dealer to act in good faith.13
A 2006 article in the The New Yorker describes the impact of the act:
Car dealers, with their low-production-value TV commercials and 
glad-handing tactics, seem like the archetypal small businessmen, 
and it’s hard to believe that they could sway the decisions of global 
corporations like GM and Ford. But, collectively, they have enormous 
leverage. Dealers are not employees of the car companies—they

(2004), p. 275.

own local franchises, which, in every state, are protected by so-called 
“franchise laws.” These laws do things like restrict GM’s freedom to 
open a new Cadillac dealership a few miles away from an old one. 
More important, they also make it nearly impossible for an auto 
manufacturer to simply shut down a dealership. If GM decided to get 
rid of Pontiac and Buick, it couldn’t just go to those dealers and say, 
“Nice doing business with you.” It would have to get them to agree 
to close up shop, which in practice would mean buying them out. 
When, a few years ago, GM actually did eliminate one of its brands, 
Oldsmobile, it had to shell out around a billion dollars to pay dealers 
off—and it still ended up defending itself in court against myriad 
lawsuits. As a result, dropping a brand may very well cost more than 
it saves, since it’s the dealers who end up with a hefty chunk of the 
intended savings.14
The American car makers are squeezed on both ends: unsustainably high 
union-enforced labor outlays coupled with huge legacy costs on one end, 
and a dealer-instigated stranglehold on the distribution of automobiles on  
the other. Defenders of the dealerships argued that dealer proliferation was 
irrelevant to GM because the dealers operated as independent businesses, 
purchasing cars and paying for their own operations. Said one letter published 
in the The Wall Street Journal, “So what if a dealership sells only 100 units a 
year? Each is a sale on which the manufacturer gets a monetary return.”15  
An article published in the The Denver Post on June 2, 2009, one day after GM 
filed for bankruptcy, explained how the dealers helped to bring down the 
company:
For years, critics of the company called for the elimination of 
the Oldsmobile division and the GMC truck division, which sold 
clonal versions of Chevy trucks. But GM found itself handcuffed 
to its obstreperous network of dealers who were protected by 
state franchise laws. It cost GM more than $1 billion to buy out 
Oldsmobile dealers when, at last, the division was closed in 2004.16
Even as GM plunged into bankruptcy and announced the closure of hundreds 
of dealerships, national and state politicians cried foul, demanding that the 
government step in and save the dealerships. Even after the goose is dead, 
the politicians were demanding that it keep on laying golden eggs. Today,

the same squawking can be heard in state legislatures as Tesla Motors attempts 
to sell through company-owned stores. Ricardo Reyes, Tesla’s vice president 
of communications, put it this way:
It is odd to me that the only thing consumers can’t buy direct is 
booze and cars in this state. Imagine the Girl Scouts having to sell 
through a distributor network. Imagine Apple having to sell through 
a distributor network.17
Often people complain that the US Justice Department does not pursue  
antitrust violations with the Megas as they have with manufacturers like 
Microsoft, or service companies like Google. However, antitrust laws are set 
up to prevent firms from acting in a monopolistic fashion, for the ultimate 
purpose of increasing prices. The Megas, with their low-cost strategy and  
penchant for driving down prices, are not violating antitrust laws. Their  
business model, with its focus on low prices, does not act against the best 
interests of consumers. While the Federal Trade Commission demonstrated 
some interest in the area during the early years of the Obama administration, 
calls for breaking up monopolistic retailers have largely been ignored.18
Private-label offerings have been a great boon for the Megas. In category after 
category, large retailers have outsourced the production of copycat brands 
or knockoff products and have placed them on their shelves right next to 
branded products. The most audacious example of private-label offerings is 
Walmart’s poaching of the White Cloud line of toilet paper, previously owned 
by P&G. The consumer products manufacturer, having decided to focus on 
Charmin, let its trademark for White Cloud expire in 1994. Walmart acquired 
the rights to license the brand from the company that picked it up after 
discovering P&G’s lapse. Other product pick-ups, while not as obvious, have 
been every bit as successful and have been protected by the courts.
Another issue is trade dress, a legal term for the nonfunctional characteristics 
of a package or a product, including design elements. The boxes containing 
Apple’s products, the packaging used for Wonder Bread, or the Happy Meal 
box used by McDonald’s are examples of trade dress. The US Supreme Court 
has ruled that trade dress is not necessarily protected by US trademark law.

Circumstances prompting the court’s decision are explained in a ruling in 
which Walmart prevailed over a garment company that had sued for trade-
mark infringement:
Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is one of the nation’s best-known 
retailers, selling among other things children’s clothing. In 1995, 
Walmart contracted with one of its suppliers, Judy-Philippine, Inc., 
to manufacture a line of children’s outfits for sale in the 1996 spring/
summer season. Walmart sent Judy-Philippine photographs of a 
number of garments from Samara’s line, on which Judy-Philippine’s 
garments were to be based; Judy-Philippine duly copied, with only 
minor modifications, 16 of Samara’s garments, many of which 
contained copyrighted elements. In 1996, Walmart briskly sold the 
so-called knockoffs, generating more than $1.15 million in gross 
profits.19
Walmart’s victory means that producers must now be able to prove that  
buyers perceive trade dress to be a marker of the company’s branded prod-
ucts. If a company has not documented the connection between trade dress 
and its brand, much of what the company considers its brand can be legally 
copied and sold by its retail partner.
Power of Producers
Figure  7-1 also displays the power that producers have in their dealings  
with distributors. While sources of manufacturer power mirror that of Mega-
Customers, the ability of producers to wield countervailing power equal to 
that of the Megas is becoming increasingly rare.
Product
The greatest source of power that a company has when dealing with the 
Megas is its products. Firms that sell truly differentiated innovations may be 
able to successfully distribute by using the mass-market distributors during 
the early phase of the product life cycle. A true innovation requires mar-
ket space in which there are few, if any, real competitors, and sufficient lead 
time, created by patents, brand power, market reach, or some other delimiter 
that keeps competitors at bay. As soon as technological, legal, or operational  
vulnerabilities weaken an innovation’s market position, the once-vaunted

product can easily become just another brand sitting on the shelf next to a 
private-label version sold for half the price. In fact, marketing though the Megas 
almost ensures the unraveling of a product’s power in the marketplace.
Mass-market distribution necessarily places a barrier between the manufac-
turer and the customer. While this does not matter for products that are 
already commodities, it makes a big difference for innovative products. For 
many companies, selling through the Megas removes the ability to effectively 
offer service and repair work. Defective products are sold, and then returned 
to the Mega without any opportunity on the part of the manufacturer to 
interact with the customer. The likelihood that products requiring servicing 
will be properly maintained is also greatly reduced. This reflects poorly on the 
producer, not on the distributor. Moreover, many products sold through the 
Megas require assembly by the purchaser, which often frustrates customers 
and further alienates them from the manufacturer.
Distributing through the Megas also robs the manufacturer of the opportunity 
to sell appropriate ancillary items. “Plus-selling” is left to sales associates who 
are unlikely to know about complementary products offered by the producer. 
For example, a John Deere riding mower can be outfitted with five variations 
of a “cargo mount” (for example, electric spreader, oscillating fan), eight kinds 
of bags, and four types of snow blowers. It is unlikely that a sales associate at 
The Home Depot or Lowes would have the knowledge to guide a customer 
through these options, even if all of these choices were available.
While the large-scale retailer is in charge of shelf allocation and the mix of 
merchandise sold, the producer has control over the innovation that has been 
created. An innovative product creates, by definition, potential space in the 
market. It is superior to, or different from, substitutes. Perhaps the product 
has features that are unavailable elsewhere, or is embedded with a degree of 
quality that makes it highly desirable. Five aspects of innovation influence the 
power of the producing firm vis-à-vis the large-scale distributor:

Differentiation
• 
Availability of substitutes

Chapter 7 | Innovation’s Second Step

Depth of Innovation
In their classic article, “The Core Competence of the Corporation,” Prahalad 
and Hamel compare a firm to a large tree:
The trunk and major limbs are core products, the smaller branches 
are business units; the leaves, flowers, and fruit are end products. The 
root system that provides nourishment, sustenance, and stability is 
the core competence. You can miss the strength of competitors by 
looking only at their end products, in the same way you miss the 
strength of a tree if you look only at its leaves.20
While these authors are speaking of the core competencies of firms, we 
believe what they are saying is also applicable to innovations. Companies 
that create at the root level, inventing core technologies with multiple appli-
cations, have what we call “deep innovations.” For example, Floating Island 
International (FII) is a Montana-based company that has created what it calls 
the BioHaven. This floating island imitates the ecological function of swamp-
lands, and can be used for environmental cleanup, water remediation, and the 
enhancement of wildlife habitat. The firm has identified more than 25 appli-
cations for its core technology.21 Producers have more leverage when they 
possess deep innovations because, as the only game in town, they are able to 
forestall the Mega strategy of product substitution. Of course, this presumes 
that the innovators understand the market they are operating in, which is not 
always the case (see the story of PenAgain earlier in this chapter).
Differentiation
Michael Porter states, “A firm differentiates itself from its competitors when 
it provides something unique that is valuable to buyers beyond simply offer-
ing a low price.22 According to Porter, such differentiation can take place  
anywhere in the value chain. Product differentiation is a minimal threshold for a 
producer if it has successfully scaled up into the mass-market environment 
while maintaining control over its product.

The Customer Trap
103
Availability of Substitutes 
Innovations are differentiated products that cannot be easily copied, whether 
because of patent and trademark protection or because they embody leading-
edge technologies.
Process Innovation 
Innovative processes consist of manufacturing methods that create the product. 
While greater efficiencies may be realized through process innovation, the 
economic value of those innovations may or may not be captured by the 
producing company.
Brand Awareness
The importance of branding has lessened as the mass retail environment has 
evolved into price-based competition involving private-label products and 
store brands. At the same time, it is critical for an innovation to become linked 
to a brand in the mind of the consumer, if that innovation is to be “owned” 
by the innovative company, and not by a competitor. Therefore, investment in 
marketing, patents, and trademarks is vital.
Once again, consider what happened to PenAgain after its experience with 
the Megas. The financial crises of 2008 forced its owners to rethink their 
distribution strategy. By 2009, they were largely out of the big-box stores and 
had entered into a distribution agreement with Atlanta-based Baumgartens, 
which provides global distribution of the product. By repositioning the pen 
as a writing aid to arthritis sufferers as well as those who experience pain 
when writing, the company developed a fiercely loyal customer base. Products 
are now sold through independent retailers and specialty stores for $4.99. 
PenAgain escaped the Customer Trap because it is a “sticky” innovation that 
simply must be in the market where its “end users need it rather than a trendy 
design where end users simply think it’s cool.”23
Scale or Size
Large manufacturers with well-known, sought-after products, have the best 
potential of going toe to toe with the Megas. A Harvard Business School case 
describes how P&G employee Tom Muccio moved to Bentonville in order to 
manage the company’s relationship with Walmart. The two sides have been 
able to work together in order to overcome various challenges and disputes 
23Interview and correspondence with company spokesman Aryeh Elbaz, February 24, 2015.

Chapter 7 | Innovation’s Second Step

over the years. For example, it cost P&G $0.90 to sell a unit of Pampers to 
Walmart for $1.00 that Walmart wanted to sell for $0.83—a 17-cent loss 
per unit. This conflict was resolved by providing the retailer with a second, 
large-sized unit priced more favorably along with other joint efforts designed 
to increase sales. These efforts resulted in an increase in inventory turnover 
from 20 to 75 times annually.
What is clear from the case is that P&G has benefited from its relationship 
with Walmart. So far, it appears that P&G is simply too big to push around, 
even though around 15 percent of the company’s sales are to Walmart. P&G 
claims that Walmart is the only retailer that it sells more than 10 percent of 
its product through. Clearly, both parties are vulnerable to any vagaries in the 
relationship; however, Walmart is not reluctant to pressure P&G as can be seen 
by its recent placement of German laundry soap Persil next to Tide.24
A Harvard Business School case disclosed that the real key to working with 
the Mega is to understand its culture and to be able to communicate concerns 
in a way that is understood by Walmart buyers. One of the key negotiation 
principles at the end of the case pretty much sums up the position of the 
smaller company “negotiating” with Walmart: “Don’t spend time griping. Be 
problem solvers, instead. Approach Walmart by saying, ‘Let’s work together 
and drive costs down and produce it so much cheaper you don’t have to 
replace me, because if you work with me I could do it better.’” Doesn’t that 
sound just great?25
Legal Context
Numerous legal protections that are afforded producers can help  
manufacturers protect themselves from encroachment by the Megas. A US 
Supreme Court ruling in 2006 reinterpreted the Sherman Antitrust Act 
so that suppliers could prohibit retailers from advertising prices below 
that authorized by the producing firm. This policy of “minimum advertised 
price,” or MAP for short, is intended to protect a brand’s image from being 
harmed through discounting practices. Typically, MAP programs are tied 
into the producers’ advertising policies so that retailers forgo advertising 
reimbursement from vendors if they advertised a price below the one that 
has been authorized.

Wal-Mart (B),” November 8, 2006.

The Customer Trap
105
MAP assists producers in two ways. First, it helps protect smaller stores from 
price-based advertising carried out by the Megas. In order to bypass the major 
discounters and sell through independent distributors and ­specialty stores, 
smaller outlets have to exist. MAP helps level the playing field by ­making 
­comparison shopping more difficult. Second, even though manufacturers ­cannot 
legally control the price charged by retailers, prohibitions against advertising a 
cheap price lessens the risk that the brand will deteriorate under a withering 
assault of big-store discounting. However, commoditization of the brand is still 
likely for other reasons discussed previously (for example, ­displaying quality 
products next to cheap knockoffs), and the fact that consumers are figuring 
out MAP and adjusting their shopping behavior accordingly. Plus, the ability of 
the Megas to offer unadvertised discounts to customers remains unimpeded. 
This means that companies that sell through the Megas may be compromising 
other channels for which a discounted price is not an option.26
Finally, not all manufacturers embrace the concept of MAP. Dave Roberts, 
the president of Comfort Solutions, the seventh largest bedding producer, 
states, “Manufacturers should not dictate the value and have control of prices. 
Manufacturers should be manufacturers, and retailers should be retailers.” 
Comfort Solutions believes that retailers are in a better position to judge 
the value of products than are manufacturers. The company abandoned MAP 
in 2013. “Why do we deserve to exist?” Roberts asks. “We offer a strong 
alternative to what is being offered in the market.”27 Time will tell if Roberts 
is correct. Based on what we have observed with other companies, unilateral 
disarmament when dealing with the Megas is not a good business strategy.
Perhaps the most important legal protection that individual producers enjoy 
is patent protection. However, as pointed out previously, patents can take 
you only so far. While the liability of the Megas increases as they “work with” 
manufacturers on the production of low-end products, designing around  
patents is a normal practice and is encouraged by antitrust law as a way of 
spurring on innovation. Sometimes the Megas don’t go far enough in their 
efforts to produce something that can stand up in court, and at other times 
they get it just right.
Manufacturers have successfully used institutional power in a broad array of 
circumstances. Efforts by auto manufacturers to persuade the US govern-
ment to limit Japanese imports during the 1980s, the “Banana War” of the 
1990s, and protectionist measures against foreign steel during the first terms

of George W. Bush all represent industry’s ability to push Washington into 
helping American commercial interests. In contrast, manufacturers have yet to 
see the Megas as a threat to entire industries. Because the Megas are viewed 
simply as another link in the supply chain of the US economy, manufacturers 
have not used their trade associations or outer political platforms to alter the 
rules that govern their relationships with the mass-market discounters.
The Second Step
Despite the challenges posed by large-scale distributors and intermediaries, it 
is possible for producers to move from small to large-scale operations while 
maintaining control over their sales and distribution. The value of innovative 
products can be shared with channel members, and—this is a big one—as a 
result of the strategic design of the producing firm, rather than according to 
the sole preferences of Mega-Customers. Firms that have successfully man-
aged to scale their businesses recognize the critical importance of controlling 
what happens to their innovated products throughout the sales and distribu-
tion chain. Notwithstanding the challenge presented by large distributors, it 
is possible to ensure that firms protect the created value they have placed in 
their products and processes.
The danger for innovators is that the firm may become fixated on moving 
its product into the marketplace with the expectation that its unique value 
proposition will make up for any hazards that might exist in whatever distribu-
tion channels are used. In such instances, the revenue generated by the innova-
tion may be disproportionately captured by Mega-Customers that control the 
circumstances of the product’s distribution.
Innovation’s first step is the creation of a new and differentiated product or 
service. If that is all that happens, an innovation misstep takes place, and the 
creation, with all of its hope and promise, may never see the light or day or 
reach its full potential. The principle governing the second step of innovation 
is this: An innovator must control the sales and distribution of its product. While 
the created value of the innovation can be shared with distribution partners, 
control over decisions about how the product is to reach customers must 
be retained by the firm. Given the overriding principle of control, we suggest 
four paths to distribution that firms can take to retain power over sales and 
distribution (and their innovation’s value) while they scale up. We refer to this 
as the “second step” in the innovation process.

The Customer Trap
107
Phase 1: Low Scale
Firms in phase 1 are too small to cope with the mass market without losing 
control of their product. Companies that successfully sell and distribute their 
innovations through Mega-Customers in this phase are likely to forfeit the 
opportunity to develop and control their products. In Phase 1, the best way 
for a firm to fully exploit an innovation may be to sell directly to customers or 
to use independent distributors.
Use Direct Marketing
As tools such as customer relationship management (CRM) software, data-
base management programs, and web-based customer service aids become 
more affordable to businesses of all sizes, the possibility of directly targeting a 
company’s micro market comes well within reach. Customer intimacy, loyalty, 
and word-of-mouth advertising are benefits that may be achieved with effec-
tive direct marketing.
Many small companies have successfully marketed their products by using only 
direct marketing. Mental_floss, a magazine specializing in trivia, makes full use of 
its web site to sell books, calendars, clothing, and other products centered on 
the revelation of quirky bits of information (for example, Teddy Roosevelt’s 
White House dojo, or what you will be driving in 2020). By creating a  
fascinating web site that is a daily stop for thousands of people, the firm is 
able to sell its products directly to customers. Many other companies, from 
business satirists Despair.com to vintage clothes specialist American Vintage 
Classics, have built their entire businesses around the Web. We’ll talk more 
about successfully implementing a direct-marketing approach in Chapter 8.
Use Independent Distributors
Alside, which invented aluminum siding in 1947, eventually became one of 
America’s largest manufacturers of vinyl building surfaces and specialty win-
dows. According to company cofounder Donald Kaufman, the principle of 
maintaining control over distribution was a core focus of the firm’s strategy. 
Kaufman states, “If we had a good distributor in a local market, we wouldn’t 
distribute the product in-house.”28 Instead, the firm would align the goals of 
the distributor with those of the firm and then manage the mutual depen-
dency that resulted.
28Interview with Alside former CEO Donald Kaufman, July 25, 2008.

Chapter 7 | Innovation’s Second Step
108
Alignment was kept simple. Alside sought market share, and its distributors 
wanted to make money by selling siding made of cutting-edge materials and 
designs. It was a classic shared-interest scenario, as both Alside and local  
distributors viewed the structure as serving both short-term and long-term 
objectives. The goal was to manage dealers so that they viewed themselves 
as partners, not merely as customers. Alside was able to avoid the high entry 
cost of establishing its own distribution center in a given market, with the 
requisite facilities and infrastructure being provided by the local partner. The 
local distributor had access to Alside’s wide range of innovative products, 
business training, and inventory management control systems.
Phase 2: Low-to-Medium Scale
Phase 2 firms are large enough to carefully approach the mass market. But 
this approach should be indirect and/or limited. In this phase, most of the 
characteristics of the innovating company are optimal. Its innovation has deep 
roots, its products are highly differentiated, and the threat of substitutes is 
low. Process innovation and brand awareness may or may not be high in this 
phase.
In addition to serving the market directly and through independent  
distributors, we suggest that a firm may approach the mass market through a 
licensing arrangement. Licensing can help the innovator to set industry stan-
dards, enhance its reputation, and create learning opportunities. In addition, 
by licensing the production of a specific product or product line to another 
manufacturer, the innovator is free of product-fulfillment responsibilities and 
can pursue product applications in other markets.29
FII, mentioned earlier, has a licensing agreement with Savio Engineering, 
which manufactures and distributes smaller BioHavens through its subsidiary, 
Freedom Ponds. Similar arrangements are in place in the South Pacific and 
New Zealand. These companies manufacture and distribute BioHavens for 
landscaping installations and the small-pond market, thereby freeing FII to 
develop its product for other applications. By licensing the production of its 
consumer-based BioHavens to other companies, FII is free to move into other 
markets that are of more interest to the firm.
Another example is Timpko, a small-engine motorcycle manufacturer in 
southern China, which has licensed its products to several distributors of 
transport-related products across sub-Saharan Africa. Each distributor has 
specific, and often different, needs for the final version of the motorcycle.  
29Ulrich Lichtenthaler, “The Drivers of Technology Licensing: An Industry Comparison,”  
California Management Review 49, no. 4, Summer 2007, p. 67–89.

The Customer Trap
109
In Kenya, the primary use of the motorcycles is for delivery by local courier 
firms. At Timpko’s plant, the Kenyan models are equipped with a secure cargo 
unit, which attaches to the rear of the motorcycle. For Ethiopia, where the 
product is primarily used by rural farmers, a special set of tires and a modi-
fied transmission are used to deal with the difficulties of the terrain. All of 
Timpko’s units are developed in conjunction with the specifications of local 
distributors, and Timpko engineers frequently travel to Africa to see if any 
alterations need to be made.30
Phase 3: Medium-to-Large Scale
In Phase 3, innovative companies eventually have the scale to effectively work 
with the big distributors. Even though product-related characteristics are 
optimal, the innovator must still enter the mass market with care. In addition 
to the licensing arrangement discussed in Phase 2, we suggest that producers 
approach large distributors with either a limited number of products or items 
specifically designed for the mass market. Firms can enhance their control 
over distribution by allowing large retailers to sell only scaled-down, simplified 
product models or a limited selection from the firm’s product line. By doing 
so, the firm has segmented the market according to channel of distribution.
For market segmentation by distribution channel to be effective, end custom-
ers must perceive a meaningful difference in products sold through different 
channels. For example, The Step2 Company, a manufacturer of outdoor play 
equipment, sells its newly innovated products exclusively through its web site, 
while promoting only standardized products on the mass market. This works 
because customers are willing to pay more for products sold directly by the 
company, recognizing these products as truly superior to mass-market offer-
ings. Experience has shown that if a firm simply uses a multichannel approach 
with an undifferentiated product, it will be forced to lower its price across all 
channels as consumers become aware that the same item is being sold less 
expensively through the large-scale distributors.31
Phase 4: Large-to-Large-Plus Scale 
For large-scale innovators that have positioned themselves properly in the 
marketplace, big retailers can be used to gain brand recognition and reach 
untapped customers. The mass market has the potential to rapidly create

widespread brand awareness and deep market penetration. This is because 
the scale of mass distribution allows producers to introduce their innova-
tions into the consciousness of consumers. Manufacturers may then be able 
to redirect consumers to the firms’ preferred routes of distribution. At the 
same time, the producer can manage its mass-market products so that control 
is maintained.
Perhaps no other company in America epitomizes innovation more than 
Apple. This firm serves as the archetype of core competency–based innova-
tion. Once viewed as a computer business, Apple has leveraged its capabilities 
to create previously unimagined markets through a succession of amazing 
products. Even so, the firm spent years languishing in the shadow of IBM and 
Microsoft. While Apple was successful as a niche player, it was unable to capi-
talize on its innovation capacity in the mass market.
The company’s first truly mass-market success was the iPod, launched in 2001. 
This product, which revolutionized the music industry, has been sold at Target, 
Amazon.com, Best Buy, and many other retail outlets. One study estimated 
that for the $299 retail price for the fifth-generation iPod, the retail margin 
totaled $75, only $5 dollars less than an estimated $80 gross margin for Apple. 
Of course, Apple also collected the retail/distributor margin for products sold 
online and in its Apple stores. The iPod, which was responsible for 35 percent 
of the firm’s revenue in 2007, but only 5 percent by 2012, is ubiquitous. This is 
largely due to the mass-marketing effort, which placed it on the shelves of big-
box retailers. The massive success of the iPod reinvigorated the Apple brand 
and set the stage for the next step—the iPhone.
Unlike the iPod, distribution of the iPhone was tightly controlled. In enter-
ing an exclusive service and distribution agreement with Cingular Wireless 
in January 2007, Apple insisted on control over pricing and distribution 
decisions. This was a departure from the way it had allowed the iPod to be 
distributed. Moreover, when the product shipped in June 2007, it was sold 
exclusively through Apple’s web site, company-owned stores, and Cingular’s 
2,100 branded stores and web site. By controlling distribution of the iPhone, 
Apple was able to capture margins previously shared with the mass market-
ers. However, this was accomplished in the wake of developing the “i” brand 
by selling iPods through the large-scale distributors.32 It was only in December 
2008, almost two years after it was introduced, that Apple began selling the 
iPhone through Walmart. Apple has been able to move between channels 
in a way that maximizes the value it retains through its innovative products.

System? The Case of Apple’s iPod,” Personal Computing Industry Center, The Paul Merage 
School of Business, UC Irvine, 2007.

The Customer Trap
111
Moreover, as of 2015 the company operates about 437 of its own retail stores 
worldwide, which are, according to a study by Morgan Stanley, a driving force 
in the company’s growth.33 This provides it with the kind of direct access 
to customers that can be used as leverage should major external channels  
(for example, Best Buy, AT&T, and Verizon) attempt to exert control over the 
relationship.34
Many other large-scale companies have opened their own stores as a means 
of gaining greater control, particularly when it comes to new product intro-
ductions, or as a means of repositioning its product or promoting a new 
­message. Lego’s 18 “concept stores” filled with 240 Lego bins, provide ample 
space for customers to interact with the product. Similarly, Bose uses its 
outlets, which have home-theater demonstration rooms, to display its audio 
components. Nike has used its stores to drive sales of shoes and clothes on 
the mass ­market, and apparel makers Puma and Lacoste have opened numer-
ous stores in strategic locations throughout the United States.

Large-scale distributors and customers dominate manufacturers when they 
can substitute the products of suppliers with those provided by other firms. 
Products that are perceived to be commodities are likely to be treated as com-
modities. When, “suppliers can be easily replaced, intermediaries are unlikely 
to be motivated to form strong relationships with them.”35 In this situation, 
the producing firm is in the unfortunate position of competing almost entirely 
on the basis of price.
The challenge for firms that are scaling up is to maintain control over sales 
and distribution without forgoing expansion opportunities that may result in 
superior long-term profitability. Strategic innovation is necessarily paired with 
the ability to sacrifice sales, market share, and short-term profits to retain 
control over the innovated product. While this does not necessarily mean a 
firm should sell its innovations through its own retail stores, it does mean that 
the firm must be determined to control distribution through each phase of 
the scaling-up process.
Controlling sales and distribution as a firm scales up is not a lockstep process 
that works the same way in every case. There is no formula that can be used 
to dictate when a company moves from one phase to the next and is ready 
to alter its channel configuration. Channel management consists of business 
decisions that managers must make based on circumstance and experience.
Moreover, successful companies operate strategically within the context of 
their values, mission, and culture. While one company may be strongly drawn 
to distribution through mass-market retail (for example, Dyson), another com-
pany may use its scale and presence in the mass market to engage in aggressive 
direct marketing or/and open its own stores (for example, Lego). Other com-
panies may eschew mass-market retail altogether, preferring to deal with cus-
tomers without any intermediaries being involved. For example, David Oreck, 
the founder of the Oreck Corporation, was strongly resistant to the notion 
of selling his product through large distributors. From the beginning, his goal 
was to create high-quality products sold at a premium price. For many years, 
he maintained that if the Oreck Corp. were to sell its XL Vacuum through the 
mass market, the product would sit on long shelves next to apparently simi-
lar machines. Customer comprehension of the XL’s “top-fill” design, durable 
wheels, light weight, and “Microsweep” would be impaired as consumers com-
pared the XL to the features of less-expensive competitors. Instead, the prod-
uct was marketed online and through 300 plus Oreck stores throughout the 
United States. According to Oreck, “Any manufacturer who does not control 
distribution will eventually be controlled by the distribution channel.”36

Approach,” International Marketing Review 3, no. 1, 1996, p. 19–32.
36Statement to the authors by David Oreck, June 17, 2005.

The Customer Trap
115
By avoiding large-scale distributors, David Oreck scaled up his business, and 
then chose not to distribute through the mass market. As a result, he pro-
tected his innovation, reserving profit margins for himself and his employees. 
Oreck introduced an innovation into a mature market through direct sales—
initially to hotels and subsequently to the public. By doing so, the firm was able 
to avoid positioning its products as direct competitors to the mainstays of the 
industry. This happened because of the philosophy and vision of the company’s 
founder. Dishearteningly, as you learned in Chapter 1, after Oreck sold the 
company and it was taken over by private equity technocrats, the approach to 
sales and distribution radically changed. And the rest is a sad history.
Table 7-1 summarizes the key considerations that managers should take into 
account as their firms move from small to large scale. Smaller firms are advised 
to be wary of premature engagement with the mass market, and it is recom-
mended that medium and large firms approach big retailers with a great deal 
of caution. While we believe that the phase approach presented here can be 
used to guide distribution strategy as a company grows, we acknowledge that 
there are likely to be deviations from these sequential stages. For example, it 
is conceivable that a firm with breakthrough innovations could allow itself to 
become dependent on a mass-market strategy. Radical innovations, such as 
the iPod or the Dyson vacuum, allow producers to operate as the equals of 
large distributors because these products are highly differentiated and difficult 
to imitate due to patent protection, learning-curve effects, and proprietary 
technology.37 Firms that create breakthrough innovations are in a potentially 
good negotiating position. For companies producing something other than 
disruptive innovations, a nuanced approach to channel entry is advisable.
As David Bryce and Jeffrey Dyer stated in Harvard Business Review:
Smart newcomers refuse to challenge incumbents on the latter’s 
terms and turf. They don’t duplicate existing business models; they 
don’t compete for crowded distribution channels; and they don’t go 
after mainstream customers—at least not at first.38
Not only should the channel not be crowded, but the selected distributor 
should not have a history of opportunism or coercion. Firms that end up 
using the wrong mode of distribution, either because they made a mistake in 
conceptualizing how to configure the channel, or because of actions by their 
distributors, should realign their channel system incrementally to achieve a 
more acceptable outcome. 39

Chapter 7 | Innovation’s Second Step
116
The mass-market system of distribution has created conditions in which large 
retailers can easily dominate small, innovative companies. But just because it is 
easy doesn’t mean it should be done. Many promising new products are now 
identified and controlled by mass marketers almost at will. We suggest that 
negative outcomes with distributors can be avoided if firms link their process 
and product innovations to sales and distribution strategies that serve the 
interests of the producing firm. Innovation simply for the sake of innovation 
does little to advance the interests of the company. Often managers assume 
their firm will automatically benefit from a technological or creative break-
through. However, who a firm innovates for is often more important than 
the innovation itself. If the value of the innovation is captured by others, the 
new product or process represents wasted effort. Ultimately, the value of an 
innovation for a producer is largely determined by how that product is sold 
and distributed.40
To capitalize on its innovation, a firm must control distribution. Channel man-
agement should not be an afterthought for the innovative company. As firms 
move up in scale, managers should reevaluate their sales and distribution 
strategy in order to target profit-maximizing channels that do not jeopardize 
the firm’s innovations.

Springs, a Montana ranching town, the company’s big promotional event is a 
yearly music festival where people “dance their pants off” in a cow pasture 
while listening to top acts, including Lyle Lovett, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou 
Harris. After one of the concerts, the county sheriff congratulated Sarah on 
the festival with this text, “Great job, Sarah. I will never arrest you for any-
thing.” Making Red Ant Pants a successful venture hasn’t been easy, but clearly 
it has involved lots of fun. “It’s neat to show that we can do big things in small 
towns,” she says.
Oh yes, the company uses Facebook, Twitter, and has placed homemade com-
mercials on YouTube. Sarah has no interest in selling through the Megas, and 
has turned down several offers to go “national” with her brand. “We have a 
lot of people who do destination trips just to buy pants,” she said, adding, 
“The really neat thing for me is that these pants really mean something to 
our customers.”1 Why has Sarah been able to tenaciously avoid doing business 
with the Megas? Her answer reflects the self-sufficient and neighborly ethic 
of Montana: “Staying independent and maintaining personal relationships is 
paramount to the values of our company.”2
Another business that has avoided the Customer Trap is Alside, a pioneer in 
the aluminum siding industry. When you envision a product like aluminum 
siding, you are likely to imagine a commodity for which buying decisions are 
based on price. But when you listen to Donald Kaufman talk about the com-
pany he successfully ran as chief executive officer for a quarter of a century, 
you can observe clearly the difference between a leader who falls into the 
Customer Trap and one who consciously stays out of it.
Jerome Kaufman, Donald’s brother, founded Alside in 1947 based on his inven-
tion of baked enamel aluminum siding that same year—a true innovation. 
In 1960, the company went public and was listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) the following year. From the beginning, this innovative manu-
facturer worked hard to control the sales and distribution of its products. 
Fundamental to the business was the close relationship the firm enjoyed with 
its customers. For three decades, Alside built and maintained a network of 
exclusive distributors across the country that worked directly with local con-
tractors to install aluminum siding on millions of American homes.
When Donald took over in 1974, consolidation began to enter the aluminum 
siding industry, threatening the independent network of dealerships that had 
developed during the previous three decades. The commoditization race was

The Customer Trap
on. The temptation to Kaufman to cannibalize the Alside distribution network 
was very real. Alside’s competitors were already abrogating control over their 
products to big-box retailers. It seemed almost inevitable that aluminum siding 
would go the way of so many other products and become a price-driven com-
modity, as the giant discounters swallowed up firms like Alside.
In the midst of the storm, Kaufman was faced with a defining moment. He 
could take the easy road and follow the crowd: shifting power to a few Mega-
Customers while lining his own pockets as Wall Street rewarded the short-
term rise in volume. Or he could dig in and face the threat head on, focusing 
on the long-term sustainability of the company. To his credit, Kaufman stood 
firm, which resulted in an enormously successful run for Alside under his 
leadership.
While women’s work pants and aluminum siding may have little in common on 
the surface, the successful approach taken by both Sarah Calhoun and Donald 
Kaufman are the same side of the coin. Each leader aligned company capabili-
ties with customers. They did this by adhering to the 10 Percent Rule—and 
by going directly to customers and building the kinds of long-term, sustainable, 
and profitable relationships that all companies need to succeed.
Not All Customers Are Equal
At its core, marketing is a means of delivering value to the customer. When 
we try to understand marketing in relation to the Customer Trap, we are try-
ing to determine whom we really want as our customers, and whom we don’t. 
Customers are not created equal, nor should they be treated the same. Most 
leaders we talk to seem to understand this at a basic level. Many, however, 
when faced with the daily rigors of setting and executing strategy in a hyper-
competitive marketplace, let operational concerns obscure this fact.
Too frequently, they treat the biggest customers—the largest volume buyers 
of their products and services—as their best customers. Size seems to matter. 
The thinking, rooted in the relentless pursuit of volume, goes something like  
this: “The more that we sell to you, the customer, the more you are valued.”  
As we have discussed, this is the bait at the entrance of the Customer Trap.
It is essential to determine whether, in fact, those big-volume customers are 
really the most profitable ones. Both Sarah Calhoun and Don Kaufman were 
aware of this pitfall, and constantly reminded themselves that it was prof-
itability, not volume, that separated the good customers from marginal or 
downright bad ones.

Marketing is a two-way street. It involves a relationship between the supplier 
and the customer. In the mass-marketing paradigm that is characteristic of the 
Customer Trap, innovative companies become misaligned because their rela-
tionships end up out of balance. The customer becomes dominant, and the rela-
tionship becomes dysfunctional. A two-way relationship with a customer that is 
balanced means that needs are aligned between the two parties. These needs 
are based on the criteria of timeliness, loyalty, vision, and ultimately, profitability.
Typologies of Customers
As shown in Table  8-1, we lay out three general customer typologies: 
Transactional, Preferred, and Strategic. Obviously this is not the only way to 
categorize customers, but it does illustrate the broad scope of categories 
under which customers can fall. The Transactional are the least attractive type 
of customer, the Preferred are more attractive, while the most attractive are 
the Strategic customers. Strategic customers are the kinds of companies with 
which manufacturers would want to form strong bonds and alliances and that 
enable them to grow their products and services over time. These Strategic 
customers enable manufacturers to continue to deliver value and to maintain 
the inherent nature of their innovative products and services.

The Customer Trap
Assessment Criteria
Volume is not a determining factor in assessing customer value. As we exam-
ine customer typologies, note that there is no criterion for how much the 
customer buys. As mentioned earlier, the profitless prosperity that so often 
exists when companies do business with a Mega-Customer permeates a com-
pany’s performance when we look at it from a volume perspective.
In other words, say we are doing 60, 70, or 80 percent of our business with a 
Mega-Customer. If we are in the Customer Trap, an analysis will show that all 
we are really doing is simply turning money over, chasing slimmer and slimmer 
profits. All we are really doing is maintaining the product or service flow to 
the Mega-Customer.
Primary Interest
Primary interest is the first criterion. Transactional customers are price driven, 
and if anybody can recollect a time when they have dealt with a price-driven 
Mega, this criterion will be easy to understand. What separates the companies 
that can do business with a Mega from those that cannot is price. Can you 
deliver on price? And not simply can you deliver on price today, but can you 
meet the constant demands for reduced prices year after year? This is what so 
many innovative companies fail to realize. The challenge is not simply meeting 
the Mega’s price the first day that you sit down to do business with them; but 
can you meet their price after the first year, the fifth year, the tenth year?
The inability to meet constant demands for lower price—transactional cus-
tomers being price driven—is what compels innovators ultimately to offshore 
and outsource the production of their products and services.
Moving across Table 8-1, you will see Preferred customers as they relate to 
the primary interest criterion. These customers do value their relationships 
over products. They are not as price driven as Transactional customers. Price 
still plays a key role, but it is not the only role. When we get to the highest 
level of customer, the Strategic, the primary interest is a long-term mutual 
dependence. Strategic customers are looking for that two-way street, where 
“we need you as much as you need us.”
Time Frame
Transactionals are based on the short term. If they do have contracts, they 
are month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year. Preferred custom-
ers tend to have a longer-term perspective, while the time frame for Strategic 
customers tends to be much longer. This is because Strategic customers are 
relationship-driven – and good relationships take time to build. Yet that is OK 
from the point of view of Strategic customers, because time is something they 
are willing to commit to the relationship.

Chapter 8 | Getting the Data and Doing Marketing Right
122
Focus
Not surprisingly, when it comes to focus, the Transactional customer is con-
cerned with the price it wants to pay and the amount of product or service 
that it wants to buy. If everything aligns at that particular moment in time, a 
deal is struck. However, everything is based on that one transaction.
Preferred customers are willing to pay more because they see value coming 
from the quality of the product or service that they are acquiring from their 
supplier. At the top end, the Strategic customer is not only looking at what 
profits can be made today, but also at what an enhanced relationship with the 
supplier might mean over time.
Demands
Demands from Transactional customers are a problem and are simply not jus-
tifiable. Transactionals want everything: a lower price, better shipping terms, 
and plenty of credit. Far too often, companies that embrace the mass-mar-
keting paradigm jump whenever asked to do something for a Transactional 
customer because many times these Transactional customers are by volume 
the biggest percent of their business. Yet, as we have seen, Transactional cus-
tomers are not driven by anything except short-term results and the price.
The demands from Preferred customers might provide the supplier with 
learning opportunities about what they are doing both right and wrong. At 
the Strategic level, demands are a way to build common possibilities that 
strengthen the alignment between the two firms.
Relationship Approach
At the Transactional level, the approach to the relationship becomes very 
focused on “us versus them”: “We’re going to get the lowest price because 
we need to.” This approach is confrontational and hostile. At the Preferred 
level, there tends to be more of a coming together, a mutuality of need, and 
a “you and I” relationship. At the Strategic level, you hear “together”—not 
simply today, but into the future as well. “We are going to do this. . . . We are 
going to make this happen.” This collaboration can take place because of the 
long-term point of view that each party maintains.
Loyalty
At the Transactional level, so driven by price and short-term results, there is 
little or no loyalty. A moderate level of loyalty exists in a Preferred relation-
ship. Perhaps it can become more, and if it does, it moves to the Strategic level, 
where the most loyal customers reside.

123
The Customer Trap
Profitability
Finally, and most important, we are in business to make profits over the long 
term and to sustain those profits. Transactional customers, although they may 
be the biggest group, are most often not the most profitable. Operational 
demands and the desire to beat up manufacturers over price, coupled with 
the negative approach that Transactional customers bring to the relationship, 
create a situation in which these customers are the least profitable. At the 
Preferred level, profits should be higher than at the Transactional level, and the 
Strategic customers would be the most profitable.
The Questions to Ask 
It is important to ask questions when looking at my company in terms of the 
way we do our marketing. What is the direction that we are taking to bring 
value to the marketplace? Who are we doing it for and how are we doing it? 
Are we focused on Strategic customers? Are we building relationships with 
Strategic customers that align our two firms? Or are we focusing primar-
ily at the Transactional level? Central to this notion of the different kinds of 
relationships that can exist with customers is not simply how the innovative 
company producing a product or service views its customers, but how those 
same customers look back at that innovative company.
If you are dealing with Walmart, for example, which has more than 125,000 
suppliers, you might ask: How many of those suppliers does Walmart really 
need? How many of those suppliers would be viewed from a Strategic point of 
view in Walmart’s eyes? There are certainly Strategic suppliers from Walmart’s 
perspective; The Coca-Cola Company, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, 
and maybe a few dozen, or, at the most, a few hundred others.
Walmart views most of its suppliers in a Transactional way. In other words, if 
it does not get the price that it wants, if it does not get its demands met, and, 
ultimately, if it cannot make enough money off those products or services that 
are purchased, then it simply will cut those suppliers loose. The dysfunctional 
nature of the Customer Trap takes over when the supplier, which Walmart 
probably views as Transactional, puts all or most of its eggs in the Walmart 
basket—mistakenly believing that Walmart is a Strategic customer.
These days, most Transactional, and even some Preferred, customer relation-
ships are the result of a mass-marketing approach. Little or no profitability is 
provided by these customer types. If the Mega-Customer gets a better chance 
for lower prices, they are likely to walk away without a thought—unconcerned 
and even contemptuous of the idea of loyalty.

Consider Columbia Paint & Coatings, which was founded in 1947 by four 
entrepreneurs who a year earlier had started a company called the American 
Chemical Corporation.4 This company built its strategy around creating rela-
tionships with the kinds of Strategic customers referred to earlier, while 
controlling critical aspects of production and distribution. Columbia began 
by obtaining zinc oxide from the American Smelting and Refining Company 
(ASARCO) in East Helena, Montana, and converting it to a pigment that was 
valuable for use in house paint as an extender pigment. Seeing that no one 
was manufacturing paints and coatings between Chicago and Seattle, the four 
men started a paint company. At that time, Helena had a population of about 
15,000 people, and the state of Montana had a population of about 500,000, 
which was not a very large potential customer base.
The founders decided that in order to grow, expansion into neighboring 
states was necessary, and that the vehicle for expansion would be company-
owned retail/wholesale stores; what the company referred to as “branches” 
or “distribution centers.” These branches would in turn sell to all end users—
homeowners, wholesalers, dealers, distributors, paint contractors, architects, 
property management companies, schools, and all forms of government. About 
5 percent of Columbia’s business comprised outside dealers or distributors 
typically consisting of hardware stores, privately owned lumberyards, and 
building material supply centers in cities that were too small for Columbia 
to operate a store of its own. By the time the company was sold to Sherwin-
Williams in 2007, it operated 41 distribution centers in eight states in the 
Mountain West, Pacific Northwest, and Alaska.
When Columbia decided to start distributing through its own stores, the typi-
cal pattern for distribution in the coatings industry in the United States was 
for the manufacturer to sell to a distributor, who sold to a dealer, who then 
sold to the end users. Columbia was one of the first regional paint compa-
nies in the country to develop the concept of vertical integration, whereby it 
bought raw materials, formulated and manufactured the product, and sold to 
virtually all end users through its own distribution chain.
According to H.H. “Larry” Larison, the president of Columbia from 1976 to 
2007, “the advantage of vertical integration and controlling your own distri-
bution channel is that you can capture a much larger piece of market share.” 
The three largest consumer segments for architectural paints and coatings 
are “do-it-yourself” homeowners, people who own property that are buying 
paint to maintain it, and painting contractors. Columbia stores were designed 
to be hospitable and to offer optimal service to those kinds of customers. 
4The discussion of Columbia Paint & Coatings is based on an interview with H.H. “Larry” 
Larison that took place on October 23, 2014.

125
The Customer Trap
As a result, the company was able to capture market share in the range of 
25 percent to 50 percent everywhere it was located. By the time Larry Larison 
sold Columbia, its total market share was approaching 35 percent.
Columbia never contacted Lowes or The Home Depot or considered using 
them as a distribution channel. Larison states: 
We were active in several industry associations. Through networking, 
we got to know some regional paint companies on the West 
Coast and East Coast who did establish relationships with Home 
Depot. Home Depot became a very significant consumer for those 
companies. As their business grew with Home Depot, and Home 
Depot became a major consuming resource for those companies, it 
put what they felt was undue pressure on them for price reductions. 
Home Depot and all the big major retailers, like Lowes and Costco, 
have a reputation for really working their suppliers hard to the point 
of unreasonableness and stretching profit margins to the point that 
it really isn’t worth continuing the relationship.
Surprisingly, the Customer Trap has not been an attractive destination for most 
regional paint companies. Instead, the Megas source paint from large national 
companies that “specialize” in selling to them. For example, The Home Depot 
almost exclusively sells Behr paints, and Sherwin-Williams and Valspar have a 
variety of private labels that they sell through the mass-merchandise distribu-
tion channel. The mass-merchandising home centers have been unsuccessful 
in penetrating the paint-contractor market because regional companies as well 
as Sherwin-Williams, which operates its own stores throughout the country, 
are tailored to optimally service the painting contractor. The Megas, which 
are retail oriented, have not been able to present themselves as effectively to 
contractors. In addition, certain kinds of retail customers don’t like big-box 
stores, but prefer the kind of individual attention and product expertise that 
they can get from stores that specialize in architectural paints and coatings as 
well as related surface preparation and application equipment. Larison states, 
“The fact that we were highly specialized attracted a certain kind of customer. 
The mass merchandisers never successfully pulled that kind of customer away 
from the manufacturer-owned store.”
Similar to STIHL, Alside, and Red Ant Pants, the regional paint companies have 
been able to distinguish themselves from the Megas by offering specialized 
service. Vertical integration also gives these companies an edge. Within ten 
years of Colombia’s founding, the Sherwin-Williams Company, which at that 
time was the largest manufacturer of architectural paints and coatings in the 
United States, changed the way it distributed its products. Previously, it had not 
operated as a vertically integrated organization and did not have paint-store 
operations selling to final customers at the end of their value chain. It was 
not until the 1950s that it began opening company-owned stores, which was 

Chapter 8 | Getting the Data and Doing Marketing Right
126
considered heresy at the time by the architectural coatings industry. Columbia 
and many other regional and national paint companies made this move and, 
within ten years, a large percentage of the industry followed course. Larry 
Larison explains how vertical integration helped Columbia compete:
There were no middlemen involved. We were taking the product all 
the way from raw material to the end user through our distribution 
system. The only level of profitability involved was our own. Because 
our manufacturing plants operated as cost centers and sold to our 
stores at break even, we took all of our profit at the stores. We 
were the manufacturer, who was selling to a distributor, who then 
supplied to a dealer, who was then selling to the end user. Those 
are three or four levels of profit taking that we consolidated under 
our own roof. And in the paint and coatings industry today, the 
two most significant channels of distribution are the big-box store 
like Lowes, Home Depot, and any regional permutations of them, 
and the paint manufacturer–owned store. There are a significant 
number of regional manufacturers scattered around the US, and 
there are two national companies, Pittsburgh Paints PPG Industries 
and the Sherwin-Williams Company, that operate company-owned 
stores in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
One of the reasons that Larison embraced vertical integration was that it 
enabled Columbia to control sales to each category of consumer without 
relying on the effectiveness of a distributor or dealer to market its products:
We marketed our products ourselves and we had a very disciplined 
approach to market. Each year our sales force developed a plan in 
which they had target accounts, accounts that they thought they 
could increase their sales to or accounts that they had never sold 
to that they hoped they could sell to in the future. We had a very 
aggressive and focused direct-sales effort. We employed effective, 
strategic pricing mechanisms that worked with each product group 
of manufactured products and nonmanufactured resale items. The 
resale items that we sold were application and surface preparation 
tools and equipment. About 30 percent of our sales were 
nonmanufactured items, and about 70 percent were manufactured 
items. The 80-20 rule generally applies in strategic pricing. The 20 
percent of your products that make up 80 percent of your sales 
are very price sensitive. The rest aren’t really price sensitive, so we 
would identify product groups that we could take stronger profit 
margins on and price them accordingly. So the high-volume paints 
and coatings items were less profitable per unit of sale, and the 
lower-volume items were more profitable because they were less 
price sensitive.

127
The Customer Trap
Smaller paint manufacturers can also participate in regional buying co-ops as 
a means of leveling the playing field. According to Larison, “A regional paint 
manufacturer can join an association where they pool their buying power, and 
are able to buy supplies from manufacturers at approximately the same price 
as a national paint and coatings company.” Different associations focus on vari-
ous products, such as the purchase of raw materials, containers, color systems, 
and merchandizing aids. “Buying co-ops are still very active and still very effec-
tive. This helps the regional paint and coatings company keep the playing field 
level with the big guy in terms of buying power,” Larison states.
Larry Larison is not intimidated by the Customer Trap, but is instead optimistic  
about the current operating environment for smaller, regional manufacturers. 
He observes the following:
When I was growing up, there was a brewery of every size that 
had branded beer. There was a meat-packing plant in every city of 
30–40,000 people or more. They all disappeared because the “bigs” 
came along and absorbed their market, made them less cost-effective 
producers and marketers. But when you look at the rebirth of the 
small brewery, with the micro brews, they are all over the place. For 
example, the former Columbia Paint & Coatings manufacturing plant 
in Helena, Montana, is now the home of Lewis & Clark Brewery, 
a small brewery operation. With recent developments, affordable 
packaging equipment is now available, and it is affordable for a small 
brewer to buy aluminum cans and package with those cans on a 
short assembly line. Lewis & Clark’s product on the shelf looks 
just as good as major brand-name beers. Another example: it is 
mechanically possible now to start a small meat-packing company 
and sell to a specialized customer base and make a profit.
In the 1960s and ‘70s the most effective retailer of paint and coatings 
was Sears. That was before Home Depot and Lowes came along to 
do their thing. As specialized home-improvement centers, Sears and 
Kmart kind of remained in the old-fashioned mode of marketing, 
and they were all things to all consumers. They were eclipsed by 
Home Depot and Lowes on the home-improvement side, and by 
more-aggressive/sophisticated marketers like Shopko, Target, and 
Walmart on the general merchandise side. It’s fascinating to watch 
the transition in almost every phase of product marketing, where 
trends change and market share shift happens.

Chapter 8 | Getting the Data and Doing Marketing Right
128
Larry Larison sums it all up with this hopeful phrase: “Resourceful small 
business can still emerge and succeed.”
An effective marketing vision is about focused, direct relationships with 
Strategic customers. Of course, it is essential to meet standards of excellence 
in business, but it must be done at the Strategic level, and to a lesser extent, 
at the Preferred level. To meet these standards, one has to get the data and 
“do” marketing the right way.
Getting the Data: The Foundation of  
Good Marketing
Many organizations find the changes in database management and communi-
cation technology to be so overwhelming that they do not know where to 
begin and how to compete.
For years, mass marketing was touted as the ultimate marketing fix, but as 
markets fragmented, marketing was aimed at smaller groupings called “seg-
ments” or “niches.” Data-driven marketing is aimed at the individual market. 
The individual market is the Strategic customer. The dentist’s office calls to 
remind you about your appointment. The closest grocery store asks for your 
card to record your purchases. You turn 50 and receive membership informa-
tion from AARP. These are all examples of the impact of data-driven marketing 
in everyday life. Very quietly and often without much fanfare, the most visible 
applications of data-driven marketing have changed the way we go about living, 
and there is no evidence to suggest that the impact will lessen.
The Emergence of Channel Data Management
Chandran Sankaran is the founder and CEO of Zyme Solutions—the pioneer 
and leader in the emerging field of channel data management (CDM). Spending 
some time with Sankaran, it quickly becomes apparent that the world of infor-
mation sharing does not work as many might expect.
Sankaran is one of those unique individuals who combines passion with rea-
son, and possesses a rational optimism that challenges conventional wisdom. 
Sankaran recognized early on that manufacturers were more than willing 
to give away control over the sales and distribution of their innovations to 
Mega-Customers in exchange for greater volume. This, he observed, has fre-
quently allowed the path to market to become muddied and transparency to 
be lacking. Sankaran wisely notes that the rise of dominant middlemen has 

129
The Customer Trap
forced companies to explore how to connect to the true customer of their 
product:
In the old school, you used to talk about routes to market, and it 
was, “How am I going to sell to Latin America?” In the new world, 
it’s really “route to customer” and “how am I going to reach Bank of 
America? How am I going to reach the guy that has the need for that 
leaf blower? How do I reach the industrial maintenance department 
at the company next door?” It’s “How do I actually reach out and 
touch those individual customers using that route to customer?”5
Sankaran recognizes the important roles that an intermediary can play, observ-
ing that few companies can become completely vertically integrated, where 
they control everything from product design and innovation to distribution 
and after-sales service. He states: “It makes sense for there to be a shared 
economy. And that’s what a distribution channel is supposed to be, a shared 
economy for sales.”
He points out that for most companies, it makes sense to have a shared 
infrastructure for marketing, distribution, and selling, as well as warehousing, 
customs clearance, taxes, and paying local transportation surcharges. “The real 
question,” he asks, “is whether you can have a shared infrastructure, without 
giving up full ownership and transparency on your performance in that infra-
structure, so that you can then make the right business decisions.”6
Sankaran is quick to point out that giving control away to channel partners 
should not be an option: “While intermediaries can provide some economies 
of scale and access to markets, just because I work with an intermediary 
doesn’t mean I have to go sit in a little cage somewhere and abrogate all my 
opportunities to them.”
According to Sankaran, discrete manufacturing companies sell over $5 trillion 
each year through indirect sales channels—with little or no visibility into the 
operational analytics to make better business decisions in these channels. His 
company, Zyme Solutions, provides product companies with the operational 
data, visibility, and analytics they need in managing their sales channels globally. 
Zyme’s network stands at 900,000 resellers/distributors around the world 
whose data they receive. Their customers are a growing breed of product 
companies gaining competitive market advantage by using data and analytics 
to drive business decisions.

Sankaran explains how innovators are waking up to the fact that data is funda-
mental to their businesses. And getting it from their channels is vital. Further, 
the benefits are not just one-way. Data sharing benefits both manufacturer 
and intermediary.
Channel visibility for manufacturers and brand owners is a relatively new phe-
nomenon. In the past, on a regular basis, distributors would use various pre-
texts to refuse to provide sales information and visibility to their suppliers. 
Customers are now starting to show much greater resolve in demanding this 
transparency. They are more likely to say to a distributor who is reluctant 
to share data, “You know what, that’s fine. The next quarter will be your

quickly come into line.
Head, Torso, and Tail
Sankaran and Zyme believe in something they call the “Head, Torso, and Tail of 
the Distribution Channel” and feel that this is a central concept in CDM. This is 
a Pareto of partners, from the largest to the smallest, as illustrated in Figure 8-1.

The Customer Trap
The Head consists of Mega-Customers, those large distributors and retailers 
in mature markets that have achieved significant market share. They move 
large volumes, and dictate commercial terms to their suppliers. These are 
usually not very profitable channels, but it’s increasingly difficult for product 
companies to avoid doing business with the Head, however painful. The Torso 
represents the up-and-comers in mature markets and some of the larger 
established players in emerging markets. The Tail typically represents the bulk 
of the intermediaries in fast-growing, smaller markets.
Figure 8-1 illustrates how this might look for a company with $600 million  
in sales.
The power of CDM and better data, Sankaran says, is that it illuminates for the 
very first time the Torso and Tail of the sales and distribution channel, thereby 
allowing manufacturers to have a real alternative to the Head (Mega). The 
Torso and Tail players are scrappier, eager to do business with you, and when 
marshaled right and organized, they can represent a real source of competitive 
advantage and greater profitability than the Head. These players are harder to 
find and orchestrate at any scale, but with better data and transparency, the 
playing field is being leveled.
The 12 Steps
To implement a data-driven marketing strategy, the Taylor Institute for Direct 
Marketing at the University of Akron has developed 12 steps.8 Why are there 
not 11 steps or 10 steps? Each of the 12 steps to a successful data-driven 
marketing program is vital and cannot be overlooked.
Skipping over and around steps in developing a direct-marketing strategy 
results in something like putting on your shoes before your socks. Each step 
provides information that refines and directs the strategy with the result that 
good direct marketing produces more results and less waste. Insight about the 
company, its products and services, and competitors are key pieces of knowl-
edge that guide the final strategic initiative. Most important, this information 
enables a company to find and keep its best customers.
8The 12-step process is elaborated upon in Andrew R. Thomas, Dale M. Lewison, William 
J. Hauser, and Linda M. Foley, Eds. Direct Marketing in Action: Cutting-Edge Strategies for Finding 
and Keeping the Best Customers (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2006).

133
The Customer Trap
Here’s a brief look at each step:
1.	 Customer analysis: Profile your best customer’s needs, 
motivation, and buying habits. Ask yourself, “What do 
they buy, and why do they buy it?”
2.	 Environmental analysis: Anticipate the need to proactively 
anticipate not only the internal needs of your customer’s 
business, but also the next move of that customer’s com-
petition that could emerge.
3.	 Competitive analysis: Find out what your competitors are 
doing right and what they are doing wrong. This will be 
valuable help in developing your own message.
4.	 Data mining and profiling: Develop a database of prospects, 
and then extract and analyze as much pertinent informa-
tion as possible to get the best possible read on your 
audience.
5.	 Targeting: Further refine your database to figure out your 
best prospects.
6.	 Positioning and differentiating: Develop the offer, or central 
selling point, in a three-step process:
a.	
Identify the attributes of the offer and the character-
istics that make it unique from your competitor’s.
b.	 Delineate the benefits your customers will receive 
upon acceptance of the offer.
c.	 Make claims that are the promised benefits for taking 
advantage of the offer.
7.	 Unique selling proposition: Shape the statement that con-
veys an implicit promise of a perceived value: it will make 
you more desirable, healthier, wealthier, wiser, and so on.
8.	 Creative marketing communications: Determine how you 
will shape the message you have crafted. The message 
package includes each component of the media campaign, 
from the tone, to the type style, to the call to action.
9.	 Direct-marketing channels: Figure out how you will com-
municate your message. By mail? Newsletter? Phone call? 
Email? Choose a direct-marketing channel that will best get 
your pitch into the hearts and minds of your customers.

Chapter 8 | Getting the Data and Doing Marketing Right
134
10.	 Fulfillment and service: Let’s say your prospect bites. How 
are you going to fill the order or the request for a free 
sample or more information?
11.	 Measurement and assessment: Track results so you know 
what you did right and wrong. Your campaign worked 
only if it cost-effectively bridged the barrier between you 
and your prospects.
12.	 Adaptation and innovation: Revise, refine, relaunch. If you 
are not totally happy with the results, do not be afraid to 
tinker with the message, communications channel, or any 
other campaign element.
Many small companies are using the 12 steps to either bypass or compete 
with the Megas, even in sectors that appeared to be “owned” by the large 
operators.
A Bookstore Sets Itself Apart
The idea for a store focused on educational tools was hatched after church 
one Sunday by two couples who found themselves lamenting the absence of 
a place to buy sound educational gifts for their children and grandchildren. 
The result was the Launching Success Learning Store, located in Bellingham, 
Washington.
After researching the needs of area educators, the new business owners 
began to work closely with private schools, homeschooling parents, and public 
school teachers and principals. The store sells books, games, arts and crafts, 
and teaching resources. Dan Sanford, one of the founders, said that the enter-
prise was driven by developing relationships with customers based on offering 
expertise and excellent service.
Dan and his colleagues would take products to off-site events—such as teacher 
curriculum workshops, school parent nights, and school programs with par-
ents and children, such as Math Night—where customers could interact with 
the products on location. Dan Sanford explains, “When people attend one of 
these events, bringing an interest in education with them, we try to be there 
with the products. Of course, it takes employee time and is nothing entirely 
new. Vendors have gone to site locations for decades, but in the educational 
materials industry, it is new to show up on location.”10
10Dan Sanford interview, October 9, 2014.

135
The Customer Trap
The Launching Success Learning Store implemented strategies aligned with 
the 12 steps outlined previously. They know their customers personally, so 
they are able to understand customer needs, motivations, and buying habits. 
They are positioned in the marketplace to offer unique, highly differentiated 
products. For example, the store built up a large inventory for special-needs 
children after discovering an unmet demand in that area. Today it sells 30,000 
products through its 5,600-square-foot building and its sophisticated and 
attractive web site. It has also formed alliances with other companies to 
extend its market reach. These include buying groups, homeschool materials 
producers, and a toy association. Most important, like STIHL (see Chapter 6), 
it imbeds its products into the context of its expertise so that customers are 
buying both the product and the service that goes with it.
The Launching Success Learning Store has been able to fend off competition 
in its category by going to great lengths to engage customers. It now holds 
curriculum in-store workshops designed to help parents evaluate and choose 
the best products. According to Sanford, “Curriculum workshops at a store is 
not a new idea. What is new are events where parents and children can prac-
tice using our materials under the guidance of our staff. Expertise is applied 
through what we call one-on-one ‘personal shopping’ with the customers. We 
provide a lot of instruction to parents on the uses of various curriculum and 
tools.”
The Launching Success Learning Store also bundles the best enrichment 
materials. One key for the company has been its human capital, which it has 
extended by hiring seniors, graduate students in education, or teachers who 
are not currently in the classroom. Finally, the company has made a large 
investment in point-of-sales software to help it stay out of the Customer Trap. 
Through data management, they know who is buying how much of their prod-
uct. Dan Sanford states, “We don’t want to over-rely on big-school associa-
tions for sales. We figured this out early on when one of the largest customer 
groups turned to Amazon. We learned our lesson, and now measure our sales 
progress without lumping in the figures from those big buying groups. We 
don’t want to become overly comfortable.”
What happens when a company follows the 12 steps? The result is that the 
firm is bringing “good news” to its customers rather than aggravation and 
frustration. The result is that relationships are formed. The result is that cus-
tomers do not feel that their time is wasted. The result is that you are part-
nering with customers, who then sing your praises to anyone who shows an 
interest. And the Customer Trap is avoided. Data-driven marketing provides 
one of the best ways to bring about that kind of difference.

Chapter 8 | Getting the Data and Doing Marketing Right
136
Is the strategy of data-driven marketing right for your company? Indeed, it 
very well may be. Whether large or small, all companies can benefit from this 
approach. Smaller companies with fewer resources can ill afford to throw 
money to the wind, so using marketing dollars wisely is essential. Larger com-
panies also have a bottom line for marketing costs, and in some cases, the 
marketing department will receive more funding when it has a proven strategy 
that works. Employing the 12 steps is current, proactive, and understandable.
If access to information is important in the domestic setting, you can imagine 
how vital it is when operating overseas. Cross-cultural differences are a good 
cover for the Customer Trap, and can turn the most rational-sounding deci-
sions into lost opportunities or worse.

Going Global 
and Keeping the 
Faith 
The art of leadership is saying “no,” not “yes.” It is very easy to say “yes.”
—Tony Blair
A few years back, a US firm that had a partnership in China manufacturing 
motorcycles went looking for new customers in Central America. Previously, 
the US firm had been relatively successful in South America and Africa, finding 
distributors for its line of basic transportation motorcycles. With an engine 
design based on a Honda model, the Chinese motorcycles were proven to  
be of acceptable quality and reliability. Most important, they were a lot 
cheaper—about half the cost of the competing Japanese models.1
The entry point in Central America was Cost Rica, which, along with Panama, 
was the most prosperous country in the region. In addition to a growing 
economy and political stability, other attractive conditions existed that might 
support strong sales, especially a rising lower-middle class that could now 
afford motorcycles for basic transportation needs.

The American in charge of sales and distribution for the US firm was able to 
find two possible distributors in Costa Rica. Full of pride because of earlier 
success in other markets, he believed himself invincible when it came to iden-
tifying who would be the best distributor in Costa Rica.
The first candidate was a young entrepreneur whose primary business was 
in the agricultural sector—especially importing farm implements and fertil-
izers. He had built a network of sales agents across Costa Rica. He believed 
the Chinese motorcycles—designed for and often used by farmers—would 
complement the current product offerings.
The second possibility, on the surface, however, seemed to be a wiser choice. 
The other firm was owned by one of the wealthiest men in all of Costa Rica 
and was the exclusive agent of Honda cars, Scania trucks, and Komatsu heavy 
equipment. The father in this family business had previously represented 
Honda motorcycles, and the son was once again interested in lower-cost 
motorcycles. To the American, this option appeared to be the best one for 
the distributorship of his firm’s products.
Market research revealed to the US firm that an annual sale of 250 motor-
cycles for each of the first three years was a reasonable expectation. This 
estimate was based on the total annual motorcycle imports for all of Costa 
Rica at around 2,700 units, with projected increases of 10 percent per year.
The American first sat down with the agricultural products distributor, who 
was very excited about the prospects of the Chinese motorcycles. Still, for 
the American, there was not a lot of satisfaction when the young man detailed 
his projections for only about 100 units annually. The young entrepreneur said 
it would take a long period of time for Costa Ricans to adopt to a Chinese 
model, but once it did happen, the potential would be enormous. Despite the 
enthusiasm, the American told his counterpart, “I will take your plan under 
advisement,” and moved on.
A short time later, the American was entering the sparkling facilities of the 
Honda/Scania/Komatsu distributor. After an hour of discussion, the American 
offered the major player the exclusive dealership for the Chinese motor-
cycles. The infrastructure of his company was quite impressive; the sales orga-
nization, service facilities, financial capabilities, and history of distribution with 
motorcycles were all outstanding. Moreover, the initial order was to be 1,000 
units—four times what the American believed he could sell in the first year. 
The only remaining step was to prepare an agreement ensuring the Costa 
Rican exclusive rights for the first five years. Then, as soon as the agree-
ment was formalized, a revolving letter of credit would be opened to ship the 
motorcycles in 125-unit increments over the first year.
Once the document was legalized, notarized, and signed, the first units were 
dispatched from China to Cost Rica. Everything was off to a great start. 
Nevertheless, when time came for the second shipment, things began to go 

139
The Customer Trap
bad. A document from the distributor to the confirming bank was required 
to reactivate the line of credit. It had not been sent. For several weeks, the 
American frantically tried to reach the Costa Rican distributor. He was always 
unavailable. When the American did reach one of the distributor’s many sec-
retaries, the responses were always the same: “He’s out of town . . . unavailable 
. . . in a meeting.” As the next shipment of 125 bikes sat at the Port of Shanghai 
and the other 700 were in production, stress was getting a bit high for the 
American.
Without telling anyone, the American flew to San Jose to find out what was 
happening. He grabbed a taxi from the airport and headed straight to the 
distributor’s office, where he was stiffly informed that the distributor “was 
unavailable for the rest of the week.” Distraught, the American was further 
frustrated to see none of the motorcycles nor promotional material for his 
bikes anywhere at the facilities.
With no other option, the American hailed a taxi. As he was headed to his 
hotel, he was shocked to witness many small motorcycles cruising the streets 
of San Jose—something that he had not seen the last time he was there. Most 
of the motorcycles were from his chief Taiwanese competitor.
After some time at the hotel bar to collect his thoughts, the American sucked 
it up and decided to call the first candidate—the one he turned down in 
favor of the rich guy. Absolutely uncertain what to expect, the American was 
blown away when the young man offered to meet for dinner. Clearly enjoying 
the moment, the Costa Rican showed some photographs of the American’s 
motorcycles in their original crates, sitting in a bonded warehouse at the 
port of Limon. He then pulled out a recent newspaper article that stated that 
sales of Taiwanese-made motorcycles might exceed 500 units that year.  As 
the American read the article, he discovered the last name of his exclusive 
distributor. It turns out his distributor’s brother was bringing in the competi-
tion from Taiwan.
Exporting the Dysfunctional Model 
It should not be surprising that many companies that are living the scourge of 
the Customer Trap at home do the same thing when they take their product 
overseas. This error is compounded by the fact that the most common option 
to enter into global markets is through distributors. Even a cursory look at 
almost any international business college-level textbook has a most glaring 
omission: the issue of distribution is often left out. When it is dealt with, it is 
often viewed as an issue of logistics. At best, the critical elements of selecting, 
bargaining with, and maintaining a strong relationship with a global distributor 
are relegated to a few paragraphs.

Blue Sky Beverage Company demonstrates the temptations of the Customer 
Trap at the international level. The Santa Fe–based firm is a small $1.8 million 
natural juice drink producer. After spending a lot of time and money looking 
for a distributor in Japan, Blue Sky president Richard Becker found Cheerio 
Kansai, a soft-drink manufacturer located in Osaka. The distribution with Blue 
Sky arranged with Kansai abrogated all of the control for the distribution of 
its product in Japan to the local agent.
As Megas often do at home, Cheerio ultimately redesigned Blue Sky’s cans, 
ran ads that Blue Sky did not understand, paid 33 percent less than Blue Sky’s 
American distributors did, and sold only two of the company’s brands—ignor-
ing everything else. Despite this maltreatment, Blue Sky justified the relation-
ship under the guise that it could not afford its own office in Japan, had risked 
little, and, most important, had achieved an 8 percent increase in total sales as 
a result of Cheerio’s first order.2
Fortunately for Blue Sky, things did not end tragically. Nevertheless, what is 
revealed is the seductive nature of distribution-manufacturer relationships in 
the industrial world. In emerging markets, which are less economically and 
politically sophisticated, such an abrogation of control can lead to corporate 
disaster.
Hope Outside the United States 
The chance that American innovators will wrestle back control over the sales 
and distribution of their products at home is slim. The Megas in nearly every 
industry are fighting tooth and nail to maintain control. And while this may 
seem bleak—and it is bleak for those caught in the Customer Trap—there is 
hope. The opportunity exists for innovators to regain control over the sales 
and distribution of their products—not at home, but in emerging markets 
overseas. In these places, manufacturers still have the opportunity to directly 
influence what happens to their products. Certainly, the Megas are trying to 
make their mark in Mexico, China, and Eastern Europe, but so far they have 
made few inroads. In fact, in many markets, the Megas have not done well at 
all. The window of opportunity is still open for manufacturers to shape and 
mold the way distribution is handled in these markets. The questions are and 
remain: Will they do it? And how can it be done the right way?

141
The Customer Trap
See It from the Distributor’s Perspective 
Academics who have looked at culture and international business always warn 
of the subconscious influence of self-reference criteria (SRC) on corporate 
behavior and actions. SRC is the unconscious tendency to interpret a particu-
lar business situation through the lens of one’s own cultural experience and 
value system.3 Many examples of SRC are cited in the business literature. For 
example, an American who equates formality with agreement and is put off 
by the gregarious nature of an Argentine customer is experiencing the effects 
of SRC.
SRC can play an important factor in selecting international distributors.  
In the Costa Rican case, the ultimate candidate was the exclusive distributor 
of Honda cars, Scania trucks, and Komatsu heavy equipment. This distributor 
had stated that his company had also represented Honda motorcycles in the 
past. In reality, however, he was involved in a directly competing venture. This 
information was deliberately withheld from the American because the Cost 
Rican saw the arrival of the American not as an opportunity, but as a threat 
that needed to be eliminated.
Most emerging markets are characterized by high risk and uncertainty. In these 
places, opportunity is constrained by turbulent events that can destabilize a 
life’s work almost overnight. Needless to say, control and predictability are of 
critical importance. In Costa Rica, rather than seeing the entrance of low-end 
motorcycles from China as an opportunity to grow market share, the distribu-
tor saw the entry of a new product as a present danger. For distributors in 
emerging markets, the environment is always full of uncertainty. Therefore, it 
is often best to lock foreign firms and other potential destabilizers out of the 
market. By entering into an agreement for exclusive distributorship in Costa 
Rica, this individual was able to deftly eliminate what he perceived to be a 
problem.
Set Minimal and Ideal Criteria 
To ensure the success of a distribution arrangement, both parties must bring 
something of value to the table.4 The first question to be answered for the 
manufacturer is, “What kind of distributor do you want?” The answer to this

March–April 1966, p. 106–114.

Chapter 9 | Going Global and Keeping the Faith 
142
question depends on circumstances and on what goals need to be achieved. 
For overseas markets, distributor selection criteria should include consid-
eration of distribution outreach, functionality, appropriateness for products, 
cultural context, consumer-distributor interaction, and past performance.5
It is critical to set the qualities needed before undertaking the screening and 
selection process. Once the criteria have been established, it is vital to stick 
to your guns at all times. A new environment, the uncertainty that accompa-
nies exporting, and the increased risk of operating in international markets all 
conspire to convince new exporters to take the easy way out, to look for a 
situation that feels good, in order to be comfortable with a distributor. Do not 
fall for that temptation.
The criteria are left to the innovator. However, whatever they end up being, 
you must be firm. Potential distributors should be held accountable to a range 
of minimum and maximum characteristics. One recommendation is to con-
sider whether a potential distributor is involved with directly competitive 
products. In emerging markets, the selection of a distributor like this almost 
always leads to failure, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses.
Equally important, the innovator needs to look inward and decide which things 
are going to be brought to the table, such as exclusivity, patent and trademark 
protection, quality, favorable pricing, training, new and improved products, and 
periodic visits.
Focus on Potential Complementors
As with the domestic Customer Trap, far too many American companies get 
burned when they choose an international distributor who represents prod-
ucts similar to their own. The flawed logic of the US firm tends to go some-
thing like this:
We need to capture as much market share as we can. Instead of 
investing all of the resources necessary to mentor a distributor who 
doesn’t really understand our products and services, it’s easier to 
locate an existing distributor who has a history of handling products 
similar to ours. We’ll educate them on what needs to be done in 
a couple of weeks. And then all they have to do is put our product 
into their pipeline. Fast, efficient, and to the point—just like we do 
at home!
Nothing could be more wrong.

Educational and Professional Publishing, 2004), p. 48.

143
The Customer Trap
The best choice for an innovator’s products in a given market is typically what 
we call a “complementor.” This consists of a local company that represents 
and distributes goods that do nothing except enhance the image and percep-
tion of the innovator’s products. In the Costa Rican example, the best choice 
was clearly the agricultural products distributor. The products that this dis-
tributor sold complemented the image of the motorcycle as a basic transpor-
tation vehicle for workers and farmers and could have opened a whole new 
market.
In Trinidad and Tobago, outdoor cookouts are a way of life. With around 25 
national holidays per year and many weeks of vacation for the average worker, 
residents make full use of their abundant free time to host massive gatherings 
with outdoor grilling as the centerpiece. Sensing a good opportunity, a US 
producer of innovative gas and propane grills decided to explore the Trinidad 
and Tobago market.
On the surface, the best potential distributor seemed to be Choice Mart, a San 
Diego–based Mega that rivals Walmart in Central America and the Caribbean. 
Choice Mart is the largest importer and distributor of grills in Trinidad and 
Tobago. And it is also the exclusive distributor for seven other brands of grills.
The US company decided it did not want its innovations thrown onto shelves 
next to its direct competitors. Instead, it looked for a complementor in the 
market. In Trinidad and Tobago, most natural gas and propane is sold at gas 
stations. Three main companies controlled the service center market, and the 
US company decided that such complementors would make an ideal distribu-
tor. In just a few short months, the US innovation was number two in the 
marketplace.
Loctite, a Connecticut-based company that specialized in adhesives, initially 
partnered with distributors who were well versed with the local market 
because these distributors carried competitors’ products. After experiencing 
the negative consequences of having the market controlled the distributor, 
Loctite began to seek out complementors—firms that they called “company 
fit” rather than “market fit.” According to one executive, “The closeness of the 
market fit can be a liability as well as an asset, because the distributors rep-
resent the market’s status quo, and we are selling a replacement technology 
and attempting to change the market.6 In contrast, company-fit partners, while 
unable to generate quick, short-term sales, are distributors who invest in the 
relationship in terms of time and are willing to be trained in the product.
6David Arnold, “Seven Rules of International Distribution,” Harvard Business Review, 
November–December 2000, p. 135.

Chapter 9 | Going Global and Keeping the Faith 
144
Explicitly Spell Out Responsibilities
As with children, responsibilities need to be defined and explained so that 
both parties have clear expectations. If not viewed correctly, a well-written 
distribution contract will give the false impression to a manufacturer that it 
really is in control. This is natural, given the detail and complexity of most 
agreements as well as the time, energy, and cost required to produce them. 
However, too often companies do not recognize the limitations of these legal 
instruments.
International distributor agreements falsely create the impression that the 
document itself has generated business. If an innovator wants to successfully 
sell and distribute its products in a new market, it will need more than merely 
a document prepared by and agreed to by lawyers. Distribution can be success-
ful only if both parties are highly motivated. The key to selling and distributing 
products in a global market is not just a legal document, but the development 
of mutually beneficial relationships and a strong, effective business strategy.
Still, a well-crafted distributor agreement can and does provide a degree of 
security against badly intentioned individuals who are seeking to hurt the 
manufacturer and impede market entry. John Deere, like so many major US 
manufacturers attempting to enter the Middle East years ago, was being wooed 
into signing a blanket agreement that allowed a local distributor to operate 
with impunity. Large initial purchase orders were dangled in front of the com-
pany as a temptation to throw caution to the wind. John Deere, however, saw 
through the scheme and presented a 32-page distribution agreement that was 
so comprehensive and thorough, it scared off the potential “distributor.” In 
this case, the agreement served as an instrument to better qualify and assess 
the credibility of a potential distributor.
Construct the Relationship 
An international distributor agreement should be viewed as the starting point 
in an ongoing and evolving relationship. Unlike the United States and Western 
Europe, where a robust legal system ensures the relative integrity of business 
transactions, the legal infrastructure within emerging markets is usually unsta-
ble and unpredictable. In India and China, for example, contracts are often 
written with clever phrases, small print, and all manner of trickery. Such con-
tractual aggression is made possible by poorly developed legal and regulatory 
regimes and court proceedings that require a great deal of time and money. 
Control or governance of foreign distributors is most effective when it is the 
result of relational norms developed and implemented by the manufacturer.
US manufacturers tend to complain that distributors do not know how to 
grow the market, are interested in only what is accessible, and underinvest 

145
The Customer Trap
in the relationship. Distributors, in other words, are often viewed as lacking 
ambition and as not caring about the relationship. Conversely, US companies 
tend to view international distributors as only a temporary expediency that 
can be jettisoned after adequate market traction positions them to open up 
their own subsidiaries. However, owning subsidiaries is an expensive and time-
intensive venture. Rather than viewing distributors as merely a quick way to 
enter a market, manufacturers should work carefully with their distributors to 
help them develop the business for the long term. David Arnold, who studied 
the relationships of 250 manufacturers and distributors, characterized success 
as follows:
They acted as if they were business partners with the multinationals. 
They shared market information with the corporations; they 
initiated projects with distributors in neighboring countries; and 
they suggested initiatives in their own or nearby markets. These 
managers risked investing in areas such as training, information 
systems, and advertising and promotion in order to grow the 
multinationals’ business.7
Constantly Scrutinize the Relationship
A number of standards exist that manufacturers can use to scrutinize the per-
formance of a distributor. These standards include sales performance, inven-
tory management, selling capabilities, attitudes, competition facing distributors, 
and general growth potential.
Again, it may seem foreign to a US company, but it is quite possible to have 
control over the sales and distribution of products in an emerging market. 
This is accomplished by exercising due diligence and staying on top of their 
distributor’s performance in a timely fashion.
Manage Communication
Part of the due diligence of US firms must also include a communication 
plan that ensures the quality and quantity of interaction between parties.  
A successful communication strategy is twofold. The first part of the strategy 
should deal with operational components such as purchase orders, delivery, 
inventory, payments, and pricing. The second part should influence the dis-
tributor’s behavior. Personal selling, advertising, sales promotions, and so on, 
are used to instill the corporate vision of the innovator into the distributor.

Challenges should be expected between partners when it comes to effec-
tive communication. Physical separation, differences in size, organizational 
type, operating procedures, and native languages will enter in at one time or 
another. These challenges are further compounded because emerging market 
distributors forge their business relationships on a foundation of inherent 
distrust of even their closest associates.
Another issue that is often overlooked is confidentiality in communications. 
Stories abound of executives traveling overseas who have been offered the 
opportunity to purchase faxes or e-mails from or to their competitors by enter-
prising hotel clerks. In many markets, it is not uncommon for meeting rooms, 
mobile phones, cars, and hotel suites to be bugged by local distributors.
Incentivize the Relationship 
In addition to monitoring, exporters can influence the behavior of distributors 
by offering appropriate incentives. Rather than providing standard operating 
procedures to control the behavior of the distributor, a laissez-faire approach 
focuses on outcomes by offering incentives and imposing penalties. The firm is 
compensated when and if sales occur, and it is penalized if sales do not occur.
PC Globe, a Tempe, Arizona-based software company, initially offered distribu-
tors exclusivity without establishing any standards of performance. Not sur-
prisingly, its overseas sales were disappointing. Eventually, the firm changed its 
approach. In exchange for exclusivity, distributors must now order and prepay 
20 percent of what they think they can sell in their first year. The exclusivity is 
guaranteed as long as they continue to order the same amount each quarter. 
According to company executives, these distributors “don’t get exclusivity as 
much as the opportunity for exclusivity.”8
You Get Only One Chance in a Market 
Although its critical importance cannot be overstated, distribution is gener-
ally the most globally differentiated and least understood of all marketing mix 
components. It is also the component most likely to hinder success in for-
eign markets, especially for small- and mid-size companies. Proper distribution 
planning can ensure that the best available channels and distribution methods 
are in place to efficiently and economically move products and services to 
customers.

The Customer Trap
The process for establishing successful sales and distribution strategies in 
high-growth emerging markets is formidable. We recommend that managers 
analyze the situation from the perspective of the distributor, set clear criteria 
for distributor selection, search out and work with firms marketing comple-
mentary products, make sure that expectations are explicit and clear, build 
a long-term relationship with the distributor, monitor the relationship and, 
provide appropriate incentives to keep the relationship on track. Through the 
application of these strategies, manufacturers will be better able to maximize 
opportunities found in global markets.
In the case of the motorcycle manufacturer who was badly burned in Costa 
Rica, the lessons from that experience slowly found their way into the corpo-
rate culture of the organization. Although many mistakes persisted in recruit-
ing and selecting foreign distributors, the American firm slowly began to realize 
the critical importance of breaking out of the dysfunctional domestic distribu-
tion model and establishing something new and much more dynamic.
Immediately after the Costa Rica debacle, mental checklists and queries among 
the staff preceded most discussions about new business. As the organization 
began to adjust its culture to the realities of global distribution, processes 
for distribution selection were formalized. Ultimately, minimally acceptable 
criteria were established. Three years later, the achieved distributor reten-
tion rate was well over 80 percent, and not surprisingly, sales and revenues 
were up more than 60 percent. The result was a series of mutually beneficial 
relationships in which the manufacturer was firmly in control of the sales and 
distribution of its products.
Globalization affords many opportunities and benefits to companies that get 
the sales and distribution of their products and services right. Not performing 
these critical business functions properly is a recipe for failure.

C H A P T E R 
Staying Local 
and Independent
Think outside the big box.
—Independent We Stand
Following the 10 Percent Rule and staying out of the Customer Trap requires 
a high level of discipline and awareness. It is even harder to stand one’s ground 
when the conventional wisdom seems to be moving inexorably toward scale 
and efficiency when it comes to dealing with customers. Everyone who grew 
up in the 1970s—or before—can remember conversations in which people 
bragged about how much they paid for something. To have paid more for 
a product indicated that a higher-quality item had been purchased. It was a 
symbol of status that people would brag about. Not anymore. For many years, 
bragging rights have gone to the person who got a good price, a fabulous dis-
count, a great deal.
This cultural shift is driven in part by the rise of cost-squeezing Mega-
Customers. Clearly, the temptation to search out the Mega-Customer is 
almost irresistible. After all, Megas exist in every sector of the economy. And 
they offer the hope of big volume to the companies whose products and ser-
vices they buy.
Many floral shops across the United States have gone through a maelstrom 
in recent years. The advent of e-commerce distributors including FTD, 
1-800-Flowers.com, and Teleflora has reshaped the industry. Increasingly, these 
services have become Mega-Customers to a growing number of local florists.  
The owners of floral shops initially viewed these new sales channels as 
opportunities to find customers who otherwise wouldn’t know about them.  
10

Chapter 10 | Staying Local and Independent
150
It seemed a great way to add instant volume to the bottom line. Of course, as 
we’ve seen, everything comes with a cost.
Florists pay around 25 percent of every order in commission and marketing 
fees to one of the online Megas, plus another $200 or so in monthly member-
ship charges. Shop owners can reject orders or ask for higher prices. However, 
rejecting orders carries another hidden cost, often $10–$100.
David Rohr, a florist in Cathedral City, California, knew right off the bat the 
costs of dealing with a Mega were too high. He quit Teleflora after Valentine’s 
Day in 2002, when he lost more than $2,000 that day as business costs and 
network fees overtook his revenue from delivery orders.
“I was able to get new customers. But you can’t make any money. They  
[the Megas] make all the money,” Rohr said.1
Even worse, according to Betsy Hall, a florist just outside Atlanta, is what  
happens to folks who use the Megas to order flowers. Hall said photographs on 
major e-commerce websites are misleading and noted that bouquets looked 
fuller than they are in reality. She also said customers who use e-commerce 
sites pay more and receive less than if they would simply contact the local 
florist in the city where they want the flowers delivered.2
The Battle Is Joined
In the face of the onslaught by the Megas across every industry, one of the 
great business stories of the past decade has emerged: the rising pushback to 
the consolidation that has fueled the rise of The Customer Trap. “Buy local” 
and other independent movements have gained strength and momentum—
providing innovators with viable and profitable channels through which to 
control the sales and distribution of their products.
One of the oldest American organizations promoting the principle that local is 
the way forward is the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). ILSR contends 
that there is nothing inherently progressive or inevitable about globalization 
and that localism and regionalism, in the form of humanly scaled institutions, 
fosters community and a higher quality of life.
ILSR argues against the common view that “bigger is better, that separating 
the producer from the consumer, the banker from the depositor and lender,

The Customer Trap
the worker from the owner is an inevitable outcome of modern economic 
development.”3 Surprisingly, little evidence supports this conventional wisdom. 
Rather, local economies have the potential to be efficient and dynamic.
In 1997 David Bolduc and Jeff Milchen decided to challenge the common view 
that the Megas—and their accompanying dysfunctionality—were inevitable 
fixtures of modern life. In cooperation with other business owners and con-
cerned citizens, they created a strategy to help communities preserve local 
businesses and foster entrepreneurship. Today the American Independent 
Business Alliance (AMIBA) helps communities organize pro-local business 
activities, such as “buy independent, buy local” campaigns, pro-local public 
policy initiatives and other work to assist local businesses.4
Independent We Stand (IWS) is another organization that strengthens local 
businesses. Recognizing that many people prefer to buy locally produced prod-
ucts, IWS helps connect consumers with local sources of goods and services. 
In doing so, IWS fosters local economic development and keeps company 
profits working in the towns and cities where revenues are generated in the 
first place.5 These organizations—and many others—are on the front lines of 
challenging the status quo. They are also demonstrating with clear, definitive 
insight that the current American business model is not only dysfunctional, but 
also unsustainable.
A Dying Idea
Despite the seemingly unstoppable rise of Megas in the current system, the 
cracks are starting to show. Consider the fact that costs are rising in low-wage 
locations as citizens begin to demand better living conditions.
China is no longer the manufacturing panacea that many thought it once was. 
Despite the slowdown in China’s economy, labor costs have nearly doubled 
since 2005. Further, the ongoing deterioration of the environment is obvious 
to anyone who visits the country. The air in most cities is too dangerous to 
breathe, and the water deadly to drink in many places.

Churning out 6 percent of global supply, the Faun Textile mill in southern  
China is the largest producer of knit cotton in the world. Located on a 230-acre  
campus, it has spent the last 25 years producing the material that goes into 
inexpensive jeans, sneakers, and T-shirts for dozens of American retailers,  
including Walmart, Target, Eddie Bauer, Nike, and Lands’ End. Fountain Set 
Holdings, a Hong Kong–based firm that places most of its effort into manufac-
turing the soft stretch cotton that goes into T-shirts and sweatshirts, owns the 
factory. The Megas typically work with Fountain Set to determine colors and 
seasonal fabric styles, though they usually buy the company’s products through 
a third party that takes the material and turns it into clothing.
In the summer of 2006, people in Dongguan, the city where the Faun Textile 
mill is located, noticed that the Mao Zhou River running through their city 
had turned blood red. An investigation by local officials revealed that a pipe 
buried beneath the factory floor was dumping about 22,000 tons of contami-
nated water into the river each day. While this was noteworthy in Dongguan, 
it was of little interest downriver, where runoff from hundreds of manufactur-
ing plants had created a river of thick, oily sludge, covered with plastic bags, 
electrical wires, shoes and other items. Said Li Changlin, a small businessman 
who works downstream from the Faun Textile mill, “We used to eat fish and 
crayfish out of this river . . . we swam in it. There were green plants on the 
banks, and the water was clear. After 1989, the factories came and the water 
turned black.”6 Unfortunately, the Faun Textile mill incident and the polluted 
Mao Zhou River are not isolated instances in China. Rather, the largest coun-
try in the world is also one of the most polluted.
For years, China’s citizens demonstrated against the destruction of their envi-
ronment. And just recently, the Communist Party started listening. In 2013, 
China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection launched a nationwide cleanup 
campaign to tackle the nation’s terrible air quality. By 2015, air quality had 
slightly improved, with only 8 out of 74 big cities managing to meet national 
standards on a series of pollution criteria, including sulfur dioxide levels.7 Still, 
despite the slow progress, it is hard to imagine China falling back into the 
wanton devastation driven by unrestrained industrial expansion.
As the economics of offshoring become less advantageous, manufacturing will 
inevitably return to the U.S. And it must return. A former Nucor CEO states 
in his book, American Made: Why Making Things Will Return Us to Greatness, that

we will need to create 30 million jobs by 2025 to turn around current unem-
ployment. He says that this will not happen if “millions of college graduates are 
slinging hash or selling Chinese-made tennis shoes” or contributing to Wall 
Street’s “malicious trading-room capitalism.”8
Back to History
The rise of Megas across industry sectors does not align with most of American 
business history. The U.S. has always been a bastion of small business owners. 
And even with the temporary predominance of Megas today, the statistics 
bear this out:
From 1997–2014, small businesses accounted for 65 percent 
• 
of all net new jobs in the economy.
Today, small businesses employ nearly 80 million 
• 
Americans—more than one-quarter of the country’s 
entire population!
Residential neighborhoods served by a successful indepen-
• 
dent business district gain, on average, 50 percent more in 
home values than markets where Megas dominate.
Independent retailers return more than three times as 
• 
much money per dollar of sales than chain competitors.
Independent restaurants return more than twice as much 
• 
revenue per dollar of sales to the local economy than 
national restaurant chains do.
For every square foot a local firm occupies, the local 
• 
economy gains $179 vs. $105 for a chain store.9
People like Mike Massey, a third-generation retailer in the New Orleans area 
who owns a chain of specialty outdoor stores, are part of a growing wave of 
small business owners who are fighting back. Disillusioned with the predatory 
nature of the Megas, and their famous ability to squeeze the life out of suppliers, 
Massey and some friends decided to create another way for manufacturers to 
access their end users. It is called Locally.com.

Massey says they realized, “there was a gap for shops who didn’t have an online 
presence. There was also a gap for shoppers who couldn’t explore their local 
shops using their Internet-connected devices. And there was a gap for manu-
facturers that wanted their range of products serviced by professionals.”10
Locally.com doesn’t sell products. It facilitates relationships between manu-
facturers, buyers, and local stores, charging a small monthly fee to the retailer 
and supplier. Using patent-pending technology, the platform aggregates prod-
uct catalogs directly from the best brands and stock information from local 
merchants. It merges powerful web tools with local expertise and infrastruc-
ture to give shoppers access to every possible buying choice, online and off.
Locally.com automatically locates each shopper geographically upon enter-
ing the site. With that information, the site assembles a marketplace con-
sisting of both local, nearby products and additional products that can be 
bought from their online partners. Their mantra is, “We don’t sell products; 
we facilitate discovery.” The idea seems to be gaining traction as more and 
more retailers and vendors come on board each month, seeking to stay both 
focused on their best customers and in control of their businesses.
Smaller Is Better
A significant portion of the rush into the Customer Trap lies in the misapplied 
approach to efficiency. The mistaken belief is that economies of scale will 
ultimately make up for any deficiencies or lapses when it comes to customers: 
size does matter—and bigger is better. As we’ve seen, this is simply not the 
case.
In 2008, shortly after graduating from college, Josh Neblett launched the 
online retail outlet GreenCupboards (now called etailz).11 The business was 
the result of a business plan that he developed in a college course, under the 
tutelage of the instructor, serial entrepreneur Tom Simpson. During its first six 
months, the small startup had sales of $5,000; its top seller was a toilet bowl 
cleaner. By 2013 etailz had $24 million in sales and was one of the fastest-
growing private companies in the country.
10Interview with authors, October 25, 2014.
11The material about etailz is based on an interview of Josh Neblett that took place on 
November 21, 2014, and an interview with Tom Simpson that took place on January 6, 2015.

155
The Customer Trap
This Spokane-based startup has been able to successfully partner with 
Amazon.com by using the Mega’s marketing and logistical reach to extend 
its brand. It is a strategy that we believe Josh (he is known by all as Josh) has 
mastered, yet one that, he would be the first to tell you, constantly evolves. 
Initially, etailz operated a warehouse and was doing its own order fulfillment. 
However, Josh quickly realized that he was not interested in storing, packaging, 
and shipping inventory. This, plus his belief that Amazon is the best logistics 
and fulfillment operation in the world, made the decision to outsource to the 
company easy.
“The one thing that separates Amazon from all the other e-commerce com-
panies that have been out there,” he states, “is their two-day free shipping with 
laser-point accuracy.” He points out that Amazon rarely makes errors of the 
“this didn’t show up” variety, which truly sets it apart.
When asked how etailz interfaces with the Amazon website, Josh states that 
people will often make a purchase from Amazon without realizing who they 
are really buying from. Customers see the little add-to-cart button—the “buy 
box”—and think that the product is from Amazon. Josh explains:
Many times you might have up to 100 people selling the exact product 
in the same listing. A lot of times you are buying from different 
merchants. We have positioned ourselves to find and locate these 
interesting, cool, unique products that are out there and tap into 
them. We aren’t really interested in what we call the race to zero. 
That’s when you have 100 companies selling the same product; you 
are going to get that race to zero. Whoever wants to make the least, 
wins. That’s not a game we are really interested in playing. Instead, 
we rely on our efficiency. Our ability to grow has been technology 
driven; we really obsess about developing proprietary software and 
we obsess over how to do things better, faster, and more efficiently. 
Our process in identifying opportunities, setting up relationships, 
ordering the product, reordering the product, all of that stuff, as one, 
whole, streamlined flow is one of the things that helps separate us. 
We are really efficient.
Josh points out that there are rumors that at some point the merchants who 
sell through Amazon will be so effective that the online Mega will move out 
of the direct retail business altogether. He states, “I am a believer that it could 
head in that direction because every time we sell something, how much work 
does Amazon have to do? Essentially nothing.” etailz takes advantage of the 
critical mass engendered by Amazon’s huge base of customers. The Mega 
incurs only an extremely limited incremental cost each time it facilitates an 
etailz transaction. For example, assuming that Amazon charges a 10 percent 
commission, it has to do very little to make $10 on a $100 sale by etailz. Josh 
states, “We could argue that that model is more profitable than their Amazon 

Chapter 10 | Staying Local and Independent
156
retail side of the model. I think they are evaluating which business model 
makes more sense for them.”
Josh Neblett is not worried about the Customer Trap. When asked if Amazon 
can put the squeeze on etailz, he answers unhesitatingly, “Of course they can!” 
and then explains:
They have flexibility but they would lose a lot of trust. If you look 
at businesses historically, like IBM, Microsoft, etc., they go through 
stages where they are king of the world, untouchable, and no one 
can do any wrong, but then someone comes in and takes over their 
market share. I don’t think anyone right now is close to Amazon, 
but at some point there will be someone, whether it is eBay or 
Alibaba that emerges or someone else. Regardless of who it may be, 
we are positioned nicely to constantly pivot and evaluate all of the 
opportunities that are out there. My point is that if Amazon does do 
those kinds of things, we will look elsewhere. And we are getting to 
the point where we are big enough to have flexibility and leverage, 
whereas early on we didn’t have that leverage.
The etailz strategy is focused on its suppliers. The company is constantly 
searching for great products with market potential. Tom Simpson explains, 
“One of the things we are very good at is our first-to-market initiative. We 
look for products that maybe have a write-up in USA Today or were on Shark 
Tank. We are looking for a new idea or product that people are applauding. 
There are products out there that people think sound cool but don’t have any 
real distribution set up. We call up those companies and we tell them how we 
can optimize their sales on the Internet.
After recruiting suppliers with unique and interesting products, etailz focuses 
on doing well by them. Josh states, “The way we look at it is our obsession 
about the customer in the standard retail sense would apply to the supplier.” 
He points out that business such as Amazon, Zappos, and eBay always talk 
about their obsession with the customer. etailz also obsesses over the con-
sumer, but it is also obsessed with suppliers and how it can add value to them. 
He asks, “What can you do to help expand that supplier’s pie?” and then 
answers rhetorically, “it is not always about selling more product.” Tom adds, 
we can optimize their sales when they work solely with us online. If you have 
a unique product and you are just working with us, your product is being dis-
played with a single voice. No inconsistency, changes in pricing, or differences 
in service. The point is that we will make sure that your brand is enhanced by 
going through us rather than 15, 20, or 100 other people like us.”
Such an arrangement, which requires a great deal of trust on the part of ven-
dors, is built when etailz works with them to optimize product placement on 
Amazon with pictures, descriptions, key words, videos, and other marketing 

157
The Customer Trap
efforts that help the supplier sell the product online. “It is one of the value-
added benefits that we offer to them,” Simpson says. In addition, etailz honors 
the pricing of its suppliers. He adds, “If they say not to sell it under $14.99, 
we won’t sell if for less. A lot of other companies may not honor a supplier’s 
price, but we do. Also, if you have a question, issue, or problem, you can call us 
and you get a person; you don’t get an e-mail.”
Josh points out that the online Megas obsess about the customer and the 
importance of the customer, while etailz has this very efficient fulfillment solu-
tion between the Mega and the customer. The result is that everyone is help-
ing everyone else to achieve the end goal. He sees the entire process as a 
cooperative enterprise. For etailz, treating suppliers as if they were customers 
was a natural evolution. After hearing suppliers complain about their dealings 
with distributors—like not getting paid on time and experiencing poor cus-
tomer service—the company began to address what they call “pain points” by 
treating their vendors as customers. Josh states, “I don’t know when we had 
the ah-ha moment. I would say that realization and that emphasis is less than 
two years old. Since we did that, it has helped us exponentially grow.” etailz 
lives out this supplier-as-customer strategy in ways that are both large and 
small. For example, when company representatives go to dinner with suppli-
ers, they pick up the bill as if those suppliers were customers. Josh says that it 
is a small gesture, but that it communicates his company’s magnanimity toward 
suppliers. The result is better performance:
We get improved relationships; we get better support from their 
team. There’s better collaboration on how we can help their brand 
grow. And if there’s good collaboration between the manufacturer 
and the retailer, you can build something special. I think that has been 
the biggest emphasis, that it has been more open and transparent 
communication. Overall it creates more of a win-win dynamic that 
historically doesn’t exist in the retail manufacturer relationship.
The Future Is Brighter Than Ever Before
In writing this book, we spent a lot of time with people like Josh Neblett and his 
partner, Tom Simpson. Their enthusiasm about the future is contagious. They 
see the world as full of opportunities, driven by radical technological change. 
The old rules don’t apply to them. Yet, they are rational optimists. Access to 
data is empowering entrepreneurs and innovators in ways we couldn’t have 
imagined even 10 years ago.
Chandran Sankaran of Zyme Solutions talks often about the “democratiza-
tion” of business, where information transparency wins out, and the ability 
to turn an idea into a viable business is easier than ever before. The path to  
market for products and services is more open and visible than any time

we’ve ever seen. Entrepreneurship is now widely viewed as a smart life choice, 
rather than merely a hobby. Much of what is required to succeed in this new 
world is an alteration in how we approach the relationships with our best cus-
tomers and suppliers. The days of big, arrogant Mega-Customers dominating 
the innovations of smaller risk takers are coming to an end.
Our Last Thought
In 2008, Jack Weil—the “Patriarch of Western clothing”—died. Mr. Weil was 
the inventor of the cowboy shirt. He was the one who put those snap-fasten-
ers on western wear, ensuring that cattlemen wouldn’t get snagged by cactus, 
sagebrush, or the horns of steers. Other adornments were added, including 
sawtooth flaps for pockets, a narrow fit to emphasize broad shoulders, and 
tight seams to show off the muscularity of the cowboy.
Mr. Weil manufactured and sold his shirts through his Denver-based Rockmount 
Ranch Wear. The shirts were manufactured in the United States. The idea of 
outsourcing to China or some other low-cost market was inconceivable to 
him. His obituary in The Economist stated:
In his long, long life, Mr. Weil accumulated plenty of simple business 
sense. He knew J.C. Penney, and thought him smart. Levi Strauss was 
a nice fellow, but got too big for his britches; Sam Walton, founder of 
Walmart, was a “hillbilly son of a bitch . . .”
Walton constantly badgered him to supply Walmart with shirts, but Mr. Weil 
never wanted any customer to take more than 5 percent of his business. He felt  
he would lose control that way, and he considered discounters low-life in  
general. What mattered were two things: quality and knowing the customer.12
It seems that Mr. Weil intuitively understood the dangers of the Customer 
Trap. We can only hope that other innovators and entrepreneurs will similarly 
share his insight and recognize that controlling sales and distribution is funda-
mental to long-term profitability and success.

Acknowledgments
The production of a book is ultimately a debt that can never be fully repaid 
to the many people whose thoughts and writings our own rest upon. We 
are honored to first thank Donald Kaufman, whose early discussions and 
introduction to his “10 Percent Rule” became the foundation for so much 
of our later work. Mr. Kaufman demonstrates that one can be both a great 
businessman and human being. His legacy will continue to stand the test of 
time for decades to come. Terry Kelly and his team at The Meridian Group 
have steadfastly stood by us over the years. Dave Wright at MediaBridge Public 
Relations was most supportive in opening new doors to new ideas. We are 
indebted to Jeff Olson, who continues to critique our work in a way that gives 
us the confidence to take on even bigger challenges as authors.
My 12+ years at the University of Akron have been a wonderful experience. 
This is due in large part to the people with whom I’ve had the pleasure to 
work. Karen Nelsen, Jim Barnett, Jim Emore, Dale Lewison, Bill Baker, Marie 
David, Doug Hausknecht, Deb Owens, Bill Hauser, Todd Finkle, Ravi Krovi,and 
Jim Divoky have each strongly supported my transition from a business career 
to an academic life. My wonderful friends—Craig Vinkovich, Elizabeth Bannon, 
Greg Dumont, and Breen Bannon—enthusiastically listened to my rambling 
thoughts longer than anyone should ever have to endure. And my Mom, Dad, 
and Grandma always stood by me, as only loving parents and grandmas can.
—Andrew R. Thomas
I would like to thank my colleagues at Whitworth University for their ongoing 
support. I am also grateful to my mentors for their encouragement and advice: 
Lance Eliot Brouthers, Dale Lewison, Mark Pagano, José Antonio Rosa, Beck 
Taylor, and Gary Young. Thanks also to Ruth Pells for organizing so much of 
what we do at the Whitworth School of Business; (amazing) student Alyssa 
Haak for helping with the manuscript; my sister-in-law, Nancy Van Maren, for 
her tough comments on an earlier draft; and most especially to my wife, Diane, 
who patiently endures her husband’s “extra” projects.

Preface
American business is dysfunctional. Small and medium-sized companies, the 
backbone of capitalism, have been lured into a misconceived and dangerous 
operational model. It works like this:
Step 1: Invest blood, sweat, tears, and money to start 
a new business or to innovate a new product or 
service. 
Step 2: Sell to the biggest customer possible. 
Step 3: Maximize the volume of sales to that big 
customer. 
Step 4: Deal with the inevitable customer demands 
that are sure to follow. 
Step 5: Try to keep quality and service at a high level 
while earning less and less. 
Step 6: Lose money.
Step 7: Wonder what went wrong while trying to keep 
your head above water. 
Much of what drives the high failure rates of businesses, along with the lack 
of success of so many new products and services, is rooted in this model. 
Business owners and managers are lured into selling most of their output to 
what we call “Mega-Customers” in the vain hope that somehow, someway, the 
added volume will translate into real profits. 
Companies falsely believe that the efficiency gained by having one, or a few, 
big customers—rather than dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of small 
ones—will guarantee a positive bottom line. These companies also believe 
that this combination of higher volume and greater efficiency is the formula 
for their future success. 
Let’s lay it out right here: They couldn’t be more wrong.
The Customer Trap becomes a reality when a company fails to follow “The 10 
Percent Rule” by allowing a single customer to become more than 10 percent 
of its total revenue. While managing a large customer appears to have many 
positive benefits, the downside risks ultimately far outweigh any positives.

Preface 
xiv
Simply by their size, Mega-Customers (those that represent more than 10 
percent of total revenue) are able to possess an inordinate amount of control 
over their supplier’s business. And while things may go well for a while, 
the distorted relationship between a company and a Mega-Customer will 
inexorably tilt in favor of the Mega.
There was a time, not that long ago, when companies controlled their products 
and services in a way that made sense for them. After all, the products and 
services were theirs. They had created them; done the testing; worked with 
and gotten approval from the myriad of lawyers, risk managers, insurance 
companies, and government regulators needed to bring them to market; and 
then developed the capacities to produce, promote, distribute, sell, and service. 
It was their skin in the game. It was their reputation; it was their future.
Customers were viewed then, as they are today, as vital to the success of the 
company. However—and this is important—customers were not supposed to 
become so big that they could take over the business of the supplier. Instead, 
customers were to be managed (remember the term “customer relationship 
management”?). The result would be that the value of the products and 
services could be shared. Not equally, mind you, but with the majority of the 
value returning to the company that originated the product or service. If you 
think about it, this makes complete sense. In the risk-and-reward environment 
that is capitalism, those who risk more should logically be rewarded more.
Yet, as we talk to business leaders around the world, it is clear that many of 
them realize that a fundamental shift has occurred. Power continues to transfer 
from those who create the products and services that fuel the economy 
to Mega-Customers who are controlling more and more of each sector of 
the global marketplace. Far too many companies mistakenly see deals with  
Mega-Customers as the way to boost their sales, market share, and profits. 
In reality, a Mega-Customer, simply because of its size relative to the supplier, 
will logically use its leverage to demand price cuts and other concessions. 
Companies end up with thin or nonexistent profit margins, and their innovative 
products and services are often treated as little more than commodities. They 
may be “doing a lot of business,” but real, tangible earnings are increasingly 
hard to come by. The outcome is profitless prosperity: a lot of business activity, 
with little or nothing to show for it.
Surprisingly, this tectonic transformation of the business landscape has occurred 
with little fanfare or real analysis. Under the banners of “scale,” “leanness,” 
“efficiency,” and “core competencies” (whereby companies focus on the few 
things they are really good at and outsource the rest), the critical functions of 
sales and distribution have been largely abandoned to others. Hardly anyone 
has noticed what is happening. For many companies, it is too late.

What This Book Is About
The subtitle of this book, “How to Avoid the Biggest Mistake in Business,” 
captures our intent to help you avoid falling into the Customer Trap. It is 
broken into two distinct parts. 
Part 1 lays out the 10 Percent Rule and what constitutes the Customer Trap. 
It provides evidence as to why falling into the trap is the biggest blunder 
you can make in business. First, as you’ll see, the scope and magnitude of a 
Mega-Customer can quickly consume the brand equity of individual products 
and services. Private labels, discounting, lack of service, and mass-market 
presentation have diluted the value of countless brands.
Second, selling through a Mega-Customer moves a company, especially an 
innovative company, further away from those who use their products. The 
ability to service and respond to the needs of consumers and endusers 
disappears when a Mega-Customer enters the mix and gains control over the 
bulk of the sales and distribution process. Even worse, the Megas create an 
environment in which innovations are commoditized too rapidly. In the natural 
course of events, today’s innovations may very well become commodities in 
the next few years. Nevertheless, the product life cycle, while guaranteeing a 
downward trajectory of innovative value, does not assign a timetable to the 
decline of innovations. Deals with Mega-Customers compress the product life 
cycle and accelerate the commoditization process. 
Next, we take a look at another rarely discussed, yet substantial problem 
that is rooted in the Customer Trap: the lack of information transparency. As 
power is increasingly gained and held by Mega-Customers, information about 
the route to the consumer and enduser is kept away from the innovative 
company. Critical sales and distribution data are held hostage, forcing the 
innovator to manage and make decisions “in the dark.”
We finish Part 1 by exploring the outsourcing compulsion. The conventional 
wisdom in government, academia, and much of industry is that companies 
choose to close their costly domestic operations in favor of better prospects 
and profits in other countries. While it is certainly true that US companies have 
been pulled overseas by the allure of potential profits and cheap labor, the vast 
majority were pushed overseas by something that is much more proximate to 
the US domestic industrial structure than the desire for new markets, lower 
labor costs, or greater efficiencies in sourcing: the United States’ dysfunctional 
sales and distribution system.

Preface 
xvi
Fortunately, it is possible for a startup, a medium-sized firm, or even a large 
company to stay out of the vice of the Customer Trap. Part 2 looks at how to 
do just that. It is rationally optimistic. For companies that are not yet in the 
Trap and for those that have fallen into it, there are simple, yet powerful ways 
to build a long-term sustainable business with the right approach to selling 
products and services. We detail the following:
How to control sales and distribution channels from the 
• 
very beginning; from the origins of the product or service 
until purchased by the enduser
How, through the acquisition and implementation of 
• 
channel data, direct marketing can offer a low-cost and 
high-reward solution for companies that choose not to 
be tempted by Mega-Customers
How, in an increasingly globalized business environment, 
• 
it is possible to go global without having to engage Mega-
Customers overseas
How the consolidation of power and control within 
• 
nearly every industry and business sector into the hands 
of a few Megas is simply not sustainable in the long run 
And how, around the world, governments, innovators, and 
• 
customers are realizing that buying local and supporting 
independent businesses is a far better option 
The benefits of the strategies and tactics described in this book can be 
immense—from the ability to retain operational control over your company, 
to higher profits and better sales, to keeping jobs in the United States. As you 
will see, you can take charge of your destiny and reap many benefits by staying 
out of the Customer Trap.
Ultimately, we believe that avoiding the Customer Trap is the best way to 
build a real, sustainable enterprise.  With all the discussions about the decline 
of American ingenuity, scarcity of resources, global competition, uncertainty 
about the economic future, and doubts about the role of government, we 
know that controlling sales and distribution is the cornerstone of business 
success, as it always has been.
