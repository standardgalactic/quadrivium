Welcome to the Museum 
of Lost Art
M
any of humanity’s greatest artworks have been lost to the 
ages, and only a sliver of what’s missing has ever been found 
or recovered. The concept of a Museum of Lost Art provides 
a cutting reminder of how fragile the world’s treasures are. Over 
12 lectures, you’ll explore the many ways in which masterpieces have been lost 
to us—and are still being lost, every day, around the world. Although stolen 
art is the most obvious example, this course covers all ways in which art can 
be lost: fire, war, iconoclasm, accidents, disasters, or even destruction at the 
hands of an artist themselves. Then there’s a whole class of art that never was 
to begin with: unrealized, unfinished, or sometimes merely a myth.

Lost Art and Subsequent Fame
Despite Leonardo da Vinci being one of the 
most famous artists to ever live, it is unknown 
how many works he created and how many 
survive. For instance, there are around only 
15 paintings widely accepted to have been 
completed by him, and at least 8 of those are 
believed to be lost. That’s to say nothing of the 
many paintings, both lost and extant, whose 
attribution to da Vinci is unclear or disputed. 
Likely, more lost works with no historical 
record at all exist. For most artists who lived 
and worked prior to the Industrial Revolution 
of the 18th century, only a fraction of their known works are extent and their 
locations known.
Moreover, there are many works known to be lost but that were renowned 
in their time. In fact, for some artists, their lost works were arguably more 
important and celebrated than those that have survived. However, our 
understanding of art is skewed, inevitably, toward works we can see. For 
instance, take Rogier van der Weyden’s Descent from the Cross, now at the 
Prado in Madrid. It depicts Christ being lowered from the cross and held 
by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus while Mary swoons and collapses 
beneath her son. With grief and heartbreak so vividly depicted, its style and 
composition were widely imitated. Art historians today see it has one of the 
most influential of the Netherlandish masterpieces, with one even arguing 
that it could be most important painting of the 15th century.
However, van der Weyden’s The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald was more 
famous during his lifetime and arguably even more influential. This series of 
four panels, which he painted to decorate Brussels Town Hall, took him several 
years to complete. It was destroyed in 1695 when Brussels was bombarded by 
France, and we only know of it today thanks to a tapestry that was made of the 
painting. As most of van der Weyden’s surviving corpus comprises other works 
from churches and altarpieces, the modern understanding of him is largely as 
a painter of religious scenes. However, his Justice was a secular painting on civic 
virtues that was greatly admired by contemporaries.

Introducing the Ghent Altarpiece
There are some works that have gone on loan to the Museum of Lost Art 
several times but have always made it back home. Perhaps no art has done 
this more frequently than the Ghent Altarpiece, or Adoration of the Mystic 
Lamb, by Jan van Eyck. It has been stolen, all or in part, on six different 
occasions—seven if you consider a sneaky sale of parts of the painting 
to be a sort of theft. Begun by Jan van Eyck’s older brother Hubert, this 
masterpiece of 15th-century Flemish painting was the most famous artwork 
in Europe upon its completion in 1432 and an object of pilgrimage for artists 
and thinkers. However, it was also the object of some 13 different crimes over 
its 600-plus-year existence. It was nearly destroyed in a fire, almost burned by 
rioting Calvinists, forged, pillaged, hidden, dismembered, censored, stolen by 
Napoleon, hunted in the First World War, sold on the sly by a renegade vicar, 
maimed while on display in Berlin, and then stolen multiple times during the 
Second World War.

Lecture 1 | Welcome to the Museum of Lost Art
The Ghent Altarpiece consists of 12 panels that depict scenes of the life, 
death, and rebirth of Jesus. It was commissioned by local patrons to be the 
centerpiece of a cathedral now known as St. Bavo’s in Ghent, Belgium. As 
soon as it was displayed, it was immediately considered to be the best painting 
in Europe. In one multifaceted work, van Eyck aimed to show the entire 
biblical story. In the central panel, crowds converge around a sacrificial lamb, 
its blood spilling into a chalice upon an altar in the midst of a great heavenly 
field, which represents Christ’s sacrifice—the Holy Grail.

Lecture 1 | Welcome to the Museum of Lost Art
The Ghent Altarpiece was the first work to showcase the unique ability of 
oil paint. Oil paint is somewhat transparent, allowing for complex layering 
of colors and details. Van Eyck used this property to capture light and 
movement—from glinting jewels to the reflection in a horse’s eye—with 
exquisite detail. Moreover, although the tradition at the time was to use 
generic faces in religious paintings, every face depicted in the altarpiece is 
unique. Amid its holy scenes, the altarpiece also incorporates snapshots of 
everyday life in this time, such as landmarks of Ghent’s city streets. With 
these true-to-life details, the work pioneered a new artistic mode that would 
come to be known as realism.
A seven-year restoration that culminated in 2019 found that, for many decades, 
viewers had been looking at a dramatically altered version of the painting. 
Over its life span, it’s been restored dozens of times. Due to heavy-handed 
restorations in the past, it was revealed that as much as 70% of the original 
work had been painted over. As the most recent restoration team removed these 
layers of paint, varnish, and grime, vibrant colors and details, such as painted 
spiderwebs and whole buildings, that had long been invisible were uncovered. 
However, some of these rediscovered details were a bit more unsettling.
Restoration of the Ghent Altarpiece

Lecture 1 | Welcome to the Museum of Lost Art
For years, people had wondered why the mystic lamb had four ears. It was now 
revealed that the second pair were pentimenti (the ghost of underlayers that 
emerged as the newer ones faded). As the restorers removed this overpainting, 
they discovered the original lamb to be bizarrely humanoid—an incarnation of 
Christ that looks right back at the viewer. Moreover, a long-debated inscription 
signed by Jan van Eyck was recently deemed authentic. In the note, Jan praises 
his older brother, Hubert, and credits him with having started the piece before 
dying. The inscription ends with a plea to take care of the work.
The Adventures of the Ghent Altarpiece
Jan van Eyck’s aforementioned pleas fell on deaf ears pretty quickly. By 1550, 
there was already a partial restoration undertaken of the altarpiece, seemingly 
because it had been improperly cleaned and damage had been done to the 
original. Particular attention was paid to the predella, a sort of step or mount 
on which the altarpiece was originally situated. It consisted of a strip of fine 
square panels, depicting hell or purgatory and Christ redeeming the saved 
and the worthy from a grim fate. The panels were done in water-based paint, 
susceptible to damage from poor cleaning techniques. The 1550 restoration 
was much praised, but the predella was destroyed by a fire not long afterward.
In 1815, a renegade vicar sold the wings of the altarpiece to an unscrupulous 
Brussels art dealer to raise money for the cash-strapped diocese. The Brussels 
dealer then sold the wings to King Frederick William III of Prussia. It 
wouldn’t be until after World War I that the wings were returned to war-torn 
Belgium by way of reparations.
Then there are the thieves, who have long sought to privately profit from the 
altarpiece. The most notorious of the six thefts remains unsolved. On the night 
of April 10, 1934, one of the 12 altarpiece panels was burgled from the cathedral 
of St. Bavo. The panel was sliced in half, separating the front and back parts. 
The recto, or back half, containing a grisaille painting of Saint John the Baptist, 
was recovered at the luggage check of a Ghent train station, returned as a show 
of good faith on the part of the thief, who then embarked on a campaign to 
extract a million francs’ ransom from the bishopric in exchange for the return of 
the other side of the panel, which depicted the so-called Righteous Judges. This 
side of the panel showed a group of men on horseback, including a portrait of 
Jan himself and of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, patron of the work.

Lecture 1 | Welcome to the Museum of Lost Art
The man who sent the letters and devised 
the theft of the panel was almost certainly 
Arsène Goedertier. He was a stockbroker 
who was heavily involved with the social 
life of the cathedral. His motivations 
have never been clear, though. Whatever 
his reason, Goedertier was an unlikely 
thief. He had an eyesight problem, which 
meant that he would have been unable 
to perpetrate the theft at night. Thus, he 
almost certainly had an accomplice, as an 
eyewitness spotted two people leaving the 
cathedral that night with a panel-sized 
package wrapped in a black sheet under 
an arm.
Over several months, a dozen ransom 
letters were exchanged between the thief and the bishop of Ghent. Then, in 
November of that year, Goedertier collapsed, and he summoned his lawyer to 
settle his affairs. With his dying words, he revealed his crimes to his lawyer 
and directed him to a hiding place where carbon copies of all 12 ransom 
letters were found, plus a 13th letter that had never been sent, which indicated 
that the panel was hidden somewhere where no one could access it without 
attracting public attention. To this day, the panel has never been found. 
It appears certain that the initial theft involved simply hiding the panels 
somewhere on the premises of the same cathedral where they had always 
been displayed. This was to facilitate the return of the panels without risking 
exposure of the thief if a ransom demand was met since they could simply 
direct the authorities to the hiding place.
During the 16th century, religious upheaval as a result of the Protestant 
Reformation and the spread of Calvinism gripped the Low Countries. Angry 
mobs of religious dissenters, often poor and economically disenfranchised, 
directed their ire against the sumptuousness of the Catholic Church. 
Their call for a more simplified and pure form of worship motivated the 
destruction of religious icons and elaborate church decorations. Depictions 
of the supernatural were particular targets, which put the Ghent Altarpiece, 
which features two hosts of angels singing angelically and playing musical

instruments, in the likely crosshairs of the purists. The altarpiece was quickly 
whisked into the church attic and then to the town hall and kept under lock 
and key for years.
Finally, after the Germans captured Ghent in 1914 during World War I, it 
was disassembled and hidden beneath walls and floorboards throughout the 
city. The Germans scoured the city and eventually threatened to raze it to the 
ground were it not handed over, but the situation was saved when an armistice 
was signed in 1918. That the Ghent Altarpiece survives at all today is almost as 
great a miracle as its creation in the first place.

Hall of Heists: Thieves and 
the Art They Steal
F
or as long as art has been made, there have been thieves eager to steal 
it. The skyrocketing prices art can command has only intensified the 
allure of getting rich quick through art heists. In Italy alone, there are 
20,000–30,000 artworks reported stolen annually, and many more go 
undocumented. You could wander the theft wing of the Museum of Lost Art 
forever. This lecture will focus on the classic heist—where one or two thieves 
hatch and execute a cunning plan to steal a high-profile object. You will learn 
about some of the diverse motivations, interesting methods, and surprising 
outcomes of these thefts.

Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
Adam Worth
Midnight, London, May 1876. Through the dark, two men walk down Old 
Bond Street and stop in front of number 39, the office of Agnew’s Art Gallery. 
Agnew’s was in the newspaper headlines, having purchased a famous painting—
Thomas Gainsborough’s Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire—for 
what was then the highest price ever paid for a work of art at auction: 10,000 
guineas. Junius Morgan, the American banker, had decided to purchase the 
Gainsborough as a princely gift for his son, John Pierpont Morgan. The sale was 
agreed in principle, but the painting would remain on display at Agnew’s first—
good publicity for the gallery. A little too good, unfortunately.
On that warm May night, the smaller of the thieves was hoisted up by his 
colleagueto the first floor of Agnew’s gallery and gained entry using a crowbar 
on a window. He cut the flesh of the Gainsborough canvas off its support, 
rolled it up, and, helped down by his colleague, vanished into the darkness. 
The portrait of Georgiana vanished without 
a trace for the next 25 years.
The police were baffled. The trail quickly 
went cold, and it remained a popular mystery 
for many years. The main culprit, as is now 
known, was Adam Worth, widely considered 
the most successful criminal in history and 
the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes’s nemesis, 
Professor Moriarty. Worth had dragged 
himself up from a homeless pickpocket to 
become one of the wealthiest men in London 
society. What led him to personally break into 
Agnew’s and steal the Gainsborough painting?
Worth had a criminally inept brother, John, 
who had managed to get himself thrown in jail in Paris. Worth was living under 
the alias Henry J. Raymond and could not bail out his brother himself without 
their association becoming known. Thus, he planned to steal the famous 
Gainsborough and ransom it back to the Agnew gallery in exchange for Agnew 
bailing John out of jail. Then, something unexpected happened: The lawyer 
Worth had hired to defend his brother won his case, and John was released.

Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
Worth decided to hide the painting away as a future bargaining chip. He 
began covert negotiations with Agnew for the ransomed return of the 
painting, but they could not agree on a price or a method of transaction that 
would not endanger Worth. After a while, Worth simply decided to keep the 
painting. His criminal enterprise caught up with him eventually, and he was 
imprisoned in Belgium in 1893. When he was released four years later, all he 
had left was the Gainsborough painting, which had been stored in a Brooklyn 
warehouse. He had become a penniless convict, his only possession a stolen 
painting, the most valuable work of art in the world.
Now, he had to broker a deal somehow to return the painting in exchange for 
desperately needed cash. He approached the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency 
to act as an intermediary to reach out to Agnew’s Gallery. There, he struck up 
an unusual friendship with William Pinkerton himself. William helped broker 
the final deal in 1901, in which Worth received $25,000 for the return of the 
Gainsborough. Worth died the next year, but not 
before telling his life story to Pinkerton, who went 
on to publish a book on Worth’s career.
The Mechanics of Art Theft
Stolen art that is easily recognizable has essentially 
no market at all. No gallery or public institution 
would touch a stolen van Gogh or Vermeer. Even 
thieves who think they are stealing art that is 
unrecognizable enough to sell will often find it’s 
not so. What market there is for stolen art generally 
consists of mid- to low-level works, which can 
sometimes be sold because they are not iconic 
or recognizable. This is particularly the case for 
ancient art and sculpture, which is difficult to 
identify, catalog, and track. The ancient Khmer 
city of Angkor in Cambodia, for example, is 
thought to be missing hundreds, if not thousands, 
of sculptural pieces that once graced this 
magnificent archaeological complex. It’s now 

12
Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
believed that dozens of Khmer sculptures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York, thought to have been legitimately acquired, were stolen from 
the site.
Online auction sites often have either forged or looted antiquities for sale. 
Listing an object online, with a doctored provenance or documented history 
that does not suggest the item is illegal, is often enough to find a buyer, as long 
as the work is not iconic. Ancient sites, especially in the developing world, are 
almost impossible to secure. Thieves need little more than the nerve to rob an 
ancient site and a connection to a legitimate-looking antiquities dealer who has 
contacts abroad. Indeed, art theft endures because there are just enough buyers 
who are willing to look the other way on works that are hard to trace.
However, art theft isn’t motivated only by a desire for profit. For example, 
Stéphane Breitwieser, a Swiss waiter who suffered from kleptomania, stole 
paintings worth more than a billion dollars, often in plain sight. He never 
tried to sell them and 
seemed unsure what to 
do with them all. He’d 
walk into a museum with 
calm confidence, go up to 
a painting, lift it off the 
wall, and walk slowly out 
with it. He projected such 
self-assurance that those who 
saw him do this assumed 
he was a staff member 
performing his normal 
duties. He usually struck 
smaller local museums where 
security was lax. His most 
valuable heist was Portrait of 
Princess Sybille of Cleves by 
Lucas Cranach, the Elder—a 
painting worth millions but 
hanging in a small castle 
museum in Germany. It 
was only after 239 paintings

were stolen that the police finally caught up with him and he was jailed. 
His mother, Mireille, hoping to hide evidence linking her son to the thefts, 
destroyed many of the stolen paintings. When Breitweiser learned of this in 
prison, he tried to kill himself: He loved the art he had stolen.
The Poor Poet
Art heists can sometimes be political statements. Such was the case of a famous 
burglary at the New National Gallery in Berlin on December 12, 1976. A van 
pulled up opposite the gallery and was left running. A tall, slender man in 
a gray raincoat emerged from it. He walked down to the basement and stood 
before three small Romantic German paintings by Carl Spitzweg, including 
one that was an icon to all mid-20th-century Germans: The Poor Poet.
A guard lingered nearby. The slender man had to get rid of him. On the wall 
opposite The Poor Poet was a painting of chess players. He crossed to it and 
started laughing theatrically. The guard approached him and asked, “What’s 
so funny?” The slender man spun and dashed to The Poor Poet, pulled out 
wire cutters from his pocket, snipped the wire on which it hung, and tore it off 
the wall. He then sprinted back to the van, hopped inside, and locked the door 
behind him.
This is a firsthand account by Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a famous conceptual 
artist better known as Ulay, of what he calls “the Berlin lifting.” It was a theft 
as artistic performance. He targeted The Poor Poet because it was well known 
The New National Gallery in Berlin

14
Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
as Hitler’s favorite painting. His longtime companion and collaborator, Marina 
Abramović, was planted in the New National Gallery before he entered, with 
Ulay’s Super 8 camera, to shoot from inside as the event unfolded. Another 
reluctant cameraman was recruited to shoot the action from the street and 
follow the getaway van.
After the getaway from the museum, Ulay drove toward a working-class 
neighborhood called Kreuzberg. His plan was to hang the stolen painting 
in the apartment of an immigrant Turkish family. However, before Ulay 
went into the family’s apartment, he stopped at a phone booth and called the 
museum, reassuring the director that the painting was fine and telling him 
where they should come retrieve it. Then, he went and hung the painting up 
in the Turkish family’s apartment. Eventually, the authorities arrived as the 
museum director confirmed that the painting was unharmed, and Ulay was 
The Poor Poet by Carl Spitzweg

15
Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
driven back to the museum. He made a statement that this was a “protest 
action, first of all against the institutionalization of art, secondarily about 
discrimination against foreign workers.”
The Poor Poet was stolen again in 1989 and has never been recovered.
Vincenzo Peruggia
The publicity that goes with art heists can turn a work into the most famous 
piece of a museum’s collection. No case demonstrates this more than that of 
Vincenzo Peruggia, whose theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911 made art stealing 
a modern sensation and indeed helped make the Mona Lisa one of the most 
iconic paintings in the world.
Peruggia worked for a firm that the Louvre had hired to build protective 
cases for some of its treasures, including Mona Lisa. He hid himself in a closet 
overnight, wearing a white smock like all the other Louvre workers. Early on 
August 21, 1911, he made his way to where the Mona Lisa was displayed. He 
hoisted the painting off the four iron pegs that held it to the wall and hurried 
Mona Lisa, Louvre, Paris

16
Lecture 2 | Hall of Heists: Thieves and the Art They Steal
over to a nearby service staircase. There, he removed the painting from the 
frame, wrapped it in a white sheet, and made a beeline for the exit. When 
he got to the bottom of a service staircase, he was surprised to find the door 
locked from the inside. Then, he heard footsteps approaching—a janitor, who 
opened the door with his key and let Peruggia out.
The Mona Lisa is one of a handful of top-level Renaissance portraits, but there 
is nothing truly unique about it. Rather, it was the 1911 theft that made the 
portrait a household name, as media frenzy quickly ensued. The investigation 
was botched: Peruggia was twice interviewed, along with all Louvre workers, 
and was never considered a suspect.
Peruggia kept the Mona Lisa for two years in the false bottom of a suitcase. 
Then, in 1913, he smuggled it to Florence and began reaching out to have it 
returned to the Uffizi museum—for a reward. He was quickly arrested. At his 
subsequent trial, Peruggia claimed patriotic intent. He asserted that the Mona 
Lisa had been looted from Italy by Napoleon—a reasonable guess, although 
untrue. However, his patriotism defense swayed the court and public opinion. 
He was sentenced to only a year in prison, which was later reduced to seven 
months. The Mona Lisa went on display at the Uffizi before returning to the 
Louvre with great fanfare, where it has remained ever since.

Lecture 3
The Mob Wing: Organized 
Crime in Stolen Art
T
his lecture will introduce you to an entirely new and much more 
sinister wing of the Museum of Lost Art. Organized crime has its 
own shadow economy, with closed and largely untraceable black 
markets forming between criminal groups. In a profession where 
bank accounts and electronic transfers are too easy to trace, stolen art can 
be a surprisingly useful asset to trade with. Most art theft involves organized 
crime at some step along the route, whether you’re talking about the thieves 
themselves, middlemen, fences, smugglers, or those ultimately acquiring the 
stolen art.

18
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
Types of Criminal Collectors
Authorities are used to following money trails, transactions that can link 
criminals to various organizations. However, in recent decades, there’s been 
a trend where criminals prefer to pay in goods or services rather than cash, 
which is far more difficult to trace. Stolen art is well suited for this. The 
tricky part is that, at least in theory, one must be able to find a buyer for 
the art to have any true value. Undercover police officers pretending to be 
criminal collectors have reported that criminal dealers will usually ask around 
7%–10% of the likely auction price for stolen art.
Organized criminals and gangs may be able to smuggle art further afield than 
your ordinary thief could. Even so, few criminal collectors have ever been 
identified, which suggests that either they are extremely good at escaping 
detection or they don’t exist in the numbers they once did—if they ever did 
at all. However, occasionally, evidence of real criminal collectors does surface. 
For example, in 2008, a painting known as the Odessa Taking of Christ, 
which was a copy of Caravaggio’s Taking of Christ that was painted shortly 
after the original, 
was stolen from 
a museum in 
Odessa, Ukraine. 
The Odessa 
version had 
been identified 
as a Caravaggio 
by Soviet art 
historians in the 
1950s but was 
definitively shown 
to be a good 
contemporary 
copy in 1993. 
The thieves likely 
thought that they 
were stealing an 
original.

19
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
The motivations behind the theft have not been established, but Nikolai 
Ponomarenko, a wealthy Ukrainian art collector, is considered to be central 
to the case. Not long after the painting was stolen, Ponomarenko was found 
murdered. In searching his home, the police found valuable paintings of 
questionable origin. A popular theory is that the original Odessa copy 
theft plan went sour somehow and the painting was used in another deal 
afterward, as it was eventually recovered in Germany. This case suggests 
that there may indeed be semi-criminal private collectors out there, perhaps 
parading as legitimate collectors who fastidiously cover their tracks.
Occasionally, though, organized criminals themselves are the collectors. Mafias 
have a long and prominent history in art thefts, including perhaps one of the 
most notorious and longest-running unsolved thefts: the disappearance of 
Nativity by Caravaggio from the Oratory of Saint Lawrence in Palermo, Sicily 
in October 1969. The trail almost immediately went cold despite a new unit 
of the Italian police being established to investigate it and other art crimes. 
Periodic evidence over the years has everyone generally agreeing that the Sicilian 
mafia, the Cosa Nostra, was behind the theft and likely still has possession of it.
Ransom
Demanding ransom from a gallery 
or collector is sometimes the 
strategy for thieves. In 1994, in 
Oslo, Norway, a brazen theft took 
place. Security footage showed 
a man walking up to the National 
Gallery carrying a ladder. He 
leaned the ladder against the 
façade and climbed up it toward 
an upstairs window. Then, he 
climbed down again, with one of 
the world’s most famous paintings 
under his arm. He had stolen 
Edvard Munch’s The Scream, 
leaving behind a note that read, 
“Thanks for the poor security.”
The Scream by Edvard Munch

20
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
The criminals behind the theft demanded $1 million for its safe return. The 
gallery refused to pay, though. The police set up a sting operation in which 
a Scotland Yard detective pretended to be a criminal art collector and tricked 
the thieves into offering him the artwork. The police were lying in wait and 
arrested four men, 
one of whom 
had previously 
been convicted of 
stealing a different 
Munch painting, 
Vampire, in 
1988. However, 
the thieves were 
released on appeal 
because the 
Scotland Yard 
detective had 
entered Norway 
using a false 
identity.
Looted Antiquities
The vast majority of art crime involves looting antiquities directly from 
illicit excavations. These items have never been seen by modern eyes and will 
never appear on any stolen art database. This means that with a doctored 
provenance—a fake paper trail making them appear to have been legally 
excavated and exported—they can be sold openly at full value, often on auction 
websites or sometimes through high-end galleries. Combined with the power 
and reach of organized criminals, the antiquities trade can get sinister quickly.
Mohammed Atta, one of the organizers of al-Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11, is a case 
in point. In 1999, he flew to Germany and showed a professor Polaroids of 
Afghani antiquities, inquiring as to what they might be worth and how he 
might find a buyer for them. She asked him why he wanted to sell them, and 
he was straightforward: to buy a plane. It seems that an earlier version of the 
9/11 plan was to have al-Qaeda sell looted antiquities to buy airplanes to crash 
into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Vampire by Edvard Munch

21
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
It wasn’t until 2015, when ISIS made it clear that it was funding terrorist 
operations partly through the sale of looted antiquities, that world authorities 
woke up to the connection between art crime and terrorism. Al-Qaeda, the 
Taliban, and Hezbollah have all trafficked in looted antiquities. The case of 
Atta and the Taliban suggests there are deeply problematic elements within 
the international antiquities trade. Western collectors and museums may 
be unknowingly (or, even worse, knowingly) helping to fund fuel conflicts, 
totalitarian regimes, and international terrorism.
Rewards
One of the most famous unsolved art thefts today involves the 13 works 
stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. In the 
hours after the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations of March 1990, two men 
posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call were admitted by 
the two security guards into the closed museum. Once inside, the disguised 
thieves subdued and restrained the guards and then set about the museum.

Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
Eighty-one minutes after they first entered, they left with an incredible haul, 
including Rembrandt’s The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and Édouard Manet’s 
Chez Tortoni. Details suggest that the thieves targeted specific works, ignoring 
some art of greater value that would have been easier to carry away.
A variety of theories have been put forth about who was responsible for the 
Gardner theft. In recent years, however, consensus has suggested that it was 
orchestrated by members of the Boston mafia and/or associates of mob boss 
Carmello Merlino. Subsequent investigations have revealed other links to 
local organized crime figures.

23
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
At around half a billion dollars, this may be the single highest-value burglary 
of all time. Johannes Vermeer’s The Concert makes up nearly half the value 
of the heist, at $250 million. However, the motivations for the theft remain 
unclear. The allure of a reward and the glory of solving such a famous case 
mean that the Gardner theft remains a holy grail for art detectives.
Rewards can be a doubled-edged sword when it comes to art crime. In 2008, 
a dozen works by the Haida artist Bill Reid were stolen from the University 
of British Columbia’s Museum of Anthropology. Because they were cast from 
gold, fears arose that the statues would simply be melted down. However, the 
posting of a reward worth much more than the market value of the melted-
down gold seems to have stayed in the hands of the thieves long enough for 
the police to apprehend them and recover most of the objects taken.
However, rewards can also motivate crime. In 1975, 28 paintings were stolen 
from Milan’s Museum of Modern Art. They were returned by associates of 
the thieves when a reward was offered. A few months later, the museum was 
burgled again, this time with 35 works taken, including some of the same 
paintings. It is probable that the same thieves double-dipped. The works stolen 
in this second heist have never been recovered.
In the Gardner case, it’s hard to see how, at this point, a $10 million reward 
will shake out the critical lead, when a previous reward of $5 million 
couldn’t—particularly as there is a consensus that the thieves, as well as the 
people who knew where the art was being stashed, are now dead.
The Difficulty of Solving Art Crime
Interpol has ranked art crime as the fourth-highest-grossing criminal trade, 
behind only drugs, arms, and human trafficking. Yet according to an article 
published in the Journal of Art Crime, as little as 1.5% of art reported as stolen 
is recovered and the perpetrators prosecuted.
A major problem is that much art crime is never reported to begin with. As 
mentioned, the vast majority of art crime involves trade in illicitly looted 
antiquities removed from unexcavated archaeological sites. Even if there 
is something to report, recordkeeping on art theft is often quite poor and 
incomplete, and often national and international authorities lack the 
information they need.

24
Lecture 3 | The Mob Wing: Organized Crime in Stolen Art
Perhaps the largest factor is simply priorities. Most countries have no art 
police at all, meaning there are relatively few specialist experts in art theft who 
can tackle these cases. Despite its obvious links to organized crime and even 
terrorism, art crime suffers from its public reputation as the domain of the elite. 
What other multimillion-dollar market relies so heavily on the unscientific 
assurance of connoisseurs to determine authenticity and value, with fortunes in 
the balance, and so rarely leaves a paper trail of transactions?
Effectively fighting art theft requires detectives with connections and insight 
into the art world, but such expertise is expensive and resources are hard to 
secure. The little attention there is on art crime also tends to be lopsided. For 
example, the Gardner art heist investigation has, by now, had millions plowed 
into it from public and private sources, thanks to its ongoing press interest 
and documentaries about it, whereas countless other thefts have not even had 
case files opened on them.

Gallery of Fakes: Forgeries

I
n 2016, a long-lost drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, the Martyrdom of 
Saint Sebastian, was discovered in Paris. The French government quickly 
declared the drawing a “national treasure” and “a precious testimony to 
the genius of da Vinci.” However, when you uncover a sketch like this one, 
how can you be sure, nearly 500 years after da Vinci’s death, that it’s the real 
deal? In this lecture, as you continue your tour of the Museum of Lost Art, 
you will duck your head into the research department, where experts try to 
separate fact from fiction.

26
Lecture 4 | Gallery of Fakes: Forgeries and Attribution
Connoisseurship and the Martyrdom of Saint 
Sebastian
The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian was first discovered when it was brought 
in to Paris’s Tajan auction house in 2016 and examined by Patrick de 
Bayser, a local art expert. When he came across the drawing in question, he 
was shocked. Though the mounting on the drawing indicated that it was 
a Michelangelo, de Bayser’s first thought was that it was in fact a da Vinci. 
In his words, “The technique was one I knew, the pen and ink from the first 
period of Leonardo. I remarked that it was a left-handed work, which I could 
tell from way the shadows were made.”
The flip side of the drawing contains some sketches, including optical studies, 
as well as handwriting that looks extremely similar to da Vinci’s. Critically, 
that handwriting is also left-handed, a vital clue, as da Vinci was left-handed. 
This served to confirm what de Bayser had immediately felt in his gut when 
he first looked upon it. This instinctive expertise is called connoisseurship, 
which is often just as much about whether an artwork “feels” authentic. In the 
absence of definitive proof, whether a work is the genuine article often comes 
down to the opinion of the most respected connoisseurs.
The stakes are high here 
because da Vinci drawings are 
hard to authenticate and easily 
confused with those of others. 
Artists often make preparatory 
sketches for their paintings and 
other works, but just as often 
they draw or copy paintings 
as a learning exercise. There 
are also paintings created not 
by an artist but by an artist’s 
studio, which consists of those 
in his employ—assistants and 
apprentices. A particularly 
talented student can get to a point where they can closely emulate their 
teacher’s style. You can even find apprentices who outdid their masters.
Da Vinci’s sketches of Sforza Horse

27
Lecture 4 | Gallery of Fakes: Forgeries and Attribution
Naturally, when Patrick de Bayser suspected that a lost Leonardo drawing might 
have come his way, he contacted a world-famous da Vinci expert: Carmen C. 
Bambach, curator of Italian and Spanish drawings at the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art. There are three aspects that experts consider when determining a work’s 
authenticity: connoisseurship, provenance, and forensics. Connoisseurship 
is an intimate knowledge of artistic style, but it is extremely opinion driven. 
Provenance is the documented history of an artwork. Unhelpfully, provenance 
is rarely complete, especially when it comes to art or antiquities that may be 
hundreds of years old. Today, people tend to think of forensic testing as the 
most definitive determinator; however, even such testing can’t rule out forgery 
completely.
Despite being the least exact of the tools, connoisseurship is the most 
critical: A painting is a da Vinci only when there is expert consensus that it’s 
one. In cases where that consensus is lacking, provenance and forensics are 
usually sufficiently open to interpretation to keep the debate alive and prevent 
conclusive attribution. In the case of the Saint Sebastian drawing, the road to 
authentication proved less rocky because most connoisseurs, such as Bambach, 
were quickly convinced.
Forensic Testing
Forensic testing is rare in 
the art trade, even with 
multimillion-dollar works. 
If experts think an artwork 
looks correct and if the 
provenance looks reasonable, 
that is usually enough to 
consider it genuine and sell 
it. Forensic testing takes 
place when something smells 
fishy in the provenance 
or connoisseurship, or if 
a new owner suddenly 
becomes suspicious that his 
acquisition isn’t what he 
thought it was.

28
Lecture 4 | Gallery of Fakes: Forgeries and Attribution
Forensic tests are most useful for flagging anachronisms. Carbon dating can 
identify the rough age of organic material, such as paper, wood, or organically 
derived pigments. There are also chemical tests to identify materials, which can 
be compared with materials known to have been used by the artist in question.
However, such testing is usually only capable of placing artworks in a broad 
period of time or region. Rarely can it prove by itself that object X is by 
artist Y. Thus, connoisseurship is nearly always needed to fill the gaps 
between provenance and forensics. This reliance on connoisseurship comes 
with significant risks because the group of relevant experts is small and the 
confident opinion of one can heavily influence the others.
Han van Meegeren
During World War II, a Dutch painter 
named Han van Meegeren began forging 
works that were meant to be by Johannes 
Vermeer. They didn’t look anything like 
Vermeer’s work, but Meegeren was clever. 
The world’s leading Vermeer specialist, 
Abraham Bredius, had published articles 
postulating that Vermeer had an early period 
working in a different style and subject 
matter, but no work from this period had 
ever been found. Thus, van Meegeren created 
works that appeared to fulfill Bredius’s 
theory. Naturally, Bredius got excited and 
authenticated the forged Vermeers. His 
reputation was such that other scholars 
decided to agree with him. Van Meegeren was able to peddle his “Vermeers” 
and even sold one to Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe and Hitler’s 
second in command. However, according to Dutch law, selling cultural 
heritage to the enemy was a crime punishable by execution.
Now, van Meegeren had to prove that the “Vermeer” he sold to Göring was 
a forgery. No one believed him because Bredius, the great expert, said it was 
a Vermeer. To save his life, van Meegeren had to paint another “Vermeer” while 
in prison. Only then was he acquitted—and Bredius made a laughingstock.
Han van Meegeren

29
Ironically, van Meegeren’s paintings can now exceed the value of what they 
would have been if authentic. In 2011, a version of the painting known 
as The Procuress by Dirck van Baburen at the Courtauld Institute was 
determined through forensic analysis to be a van Meegeren forgery that had 
slipped through the cracks. Van Baburen was a contemporary of Vermeer, and 
this work was probably only meant to be a prop for his Vermeer forgeries, as it 
appears in the background of another of Vermeer’s paintings of a lady sitting 
at a virginal. As a work of the now legendary van Meegeren, the painting is 
estimated to be worth more at auction than if it were, in fact, the van Baburen 
it purported to be.
The Power of Subjectivity
It’s incredible to think how complex and fraught the process of authenticating 
art is and yet how often it still comes down to subjective conclusions of 
specialists. Opinions can shift the value from millions to thousands and 
back again—particularly since there is little recourse to challenge the calls 
of the connoisseur. In 2011, the British television show Fake or Fortune?, 
in which investigators attempt to solve disputed art attributions, gathered 
extensive evidence that a painting known as Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil was 
a lost work by Claude Monet. New documentation of its chain of sales and 
provenance as well as extensive forensic analysis convinced several experts that 
the painting was genuine. However, for many galleries and auction houses, 
the primary authority for determining the authenticity of a Monet is the 
catalog raisonné of his work, published by the Wildenstein Institute in Paris. 
One of van Meegren’s fake Vermeers

30
Lecture 4 | Gallery of Fakes: Forgeries and Attribution
Its founder, Daniel Wildenstein, was considered one of the most influential 
collectors and connoisseurs of French art—so much so that his conclusions 
are still considered definitive even decades after his death.
Despite the significant new evidence and expert testimony collected, the 
Wildenstein Institute has refused to overrule the judgment of its former director, 
who had looked at the work only once before his death and determined that 
it simply didn’t feel like a true Monet. Without the institute’s blessing or its 
inclusion in Monet’s official catalog, no reputable auction house or gallery will 
be willing to list it as authentic. Yet, the Wildenstein Institute is not a public 
institution. Its discussions and proceedings are not matters of public record, 
and its decisions are not subject to higher review. With authentication decisions 
potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars, it feels like the twilight zone 
sometimes—especially when you consider that experts themselves are often 
unsure about how to judge a work’s authenticity.
For example, a painting called Judith and Holofernes was found in someone’s 
attic in Toulouse, France. It looked like a Caravaggio of the same subject that 
is on display at Palazzo Barberini in Rome. An archival record confirms that 
Caravaggio made a copy of his own Judith and Holofernes and that the copy was 
lost. This might indeed be it. That’s an example of the provenance checking 
out. The historical record does not contradict that this could be a Caravaggio. 
Still, experts remain divided. Is it a Caravaggio and therefore worth north of 
$100 million? Or is it by a follower of Caravaggio, such as Louis Finson, and 
perhaps worth $1 million? That’s a significant difference hinging on arguing 
professors.

Plundered through Conflict
A
rt has long been a prominent casualty of war. As you will see in 
this lecture, the war and violence wing of the Museum of Lost 
Art is a chilling reminder that conflicts deprive people of not only 
their homes, countries, or lives but also their history, identity, and 
culture. Yet, art can also be a rallying cry—a symbol of hope. You can destroy 
a work of art, but you cannot destroy the hearts of the artist and those who 
love their creations.

Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
The Targeting of Art
War and art have a long and troubled relationship. In 212 BC, the Roman 
Republican army captured the Greek city of Siracusa, in Sicily, after a lengthy 
siege. Roman soldiers furiously rampaged through the defeated city, carrying 
off a treasure trove of art, from sculptures to vases, back to Italy. The sack 
sparked a Roman enthusiasm for collecting Hellenistic antiquities and 
resulted in the proactive shift in military strategy to acquire more art through 
looting. The mere fact that the Romans plundered art established a sort 
of precedent for later empires. Indeed, in nearly every subsequent war and 
conflict, art has found itself a prominent victim of the fighting.
Some looted works become so prominently associated with their captors that 
their gruesome provenance is almost forgotten. For example, standing on 
Saint Mark’s Basilica in Venice is one of the most famous symbols of the city, 
known today as the Horses of Saint Mark. Yet for centuries, these horses stood 
guarding a different building, the Hippodrome of Constantinople in what 
is today Istanbul, as treasures of the Byzantine Empire. They were removed 
from the city in 1204 by the Venetians during the Fourth Crusade in perhaps 
one of the most egregious episodes of artistic looting in history.

Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
Religion was at the center of the sack of Prague by Swedish troops in 1648. 
During the peace negotiations to end this devastating conflict, the Swedes saw 
their chance to loot the phenomenally rich artistic and scientific collections 
collected by the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle. The majority 
of these treasures, including priceless manuscripts such as the Codex Gigas 
and Codex Argenteus, were taken back to Sweden, where they were absorbed 
into the collection of Queen Christina. Christina would ultimately abdicate 
the throne and go into exile in Rome, but she took with her some of the 
best of the royal collection and at least 50 paintings that had been stolen 
from Prague.
This would be important to the history of legal art collecting since the 
best works from her catalog were passed to the Duke of Orleans after 
her death. The duke added many more priceless works to what would 
become the legendary Orleans Collection, which was sold off during the 
French Revolution to cover the gambling debts of his descendant Louis 
Philippe d’Orleans. Dozens of paintings that had been pillaged from 
Prague more than a century earlier found their way into national collections 
worldwide.
Napoleon’s Looting
During the Napoleonic era, art 
looting was taken to new heights, 
funding the war effort and raising 
morale back at home. Napoleon 
established the first official 
division of an army dedicated to 
seizing and transporting captured 
artworks. Specially trained officials 
would follow behind the army to 
confiscate, pack, and ship art back 
to Paris. There, they would be 
received by the newly converted 
Louvre Museum. Some works 
were irreparably damaged and 
transformed by the process.
Napoleon

34
Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
Napoleon expunged the most loot 
from the Papal States through the 
Treaty of Tolentino in June 1796. 
The papacy had to pay Napoleon 21 
million livres, and Article 8 of the 
treaty stated that the pope was to give 
Napoleon “a hundred pictures, busts, 
vases, or statues to be selected by the 
commissioners and sent to Rome, 
including in particular the bronze bust 
of Junius Brutus and the marble bust 
of Marcus Brutus, both on the Capitol, 
[and] also five hundred manuscripts at 
the choice of the said commissions.” 
Eighty-three sculptures were also 
taken, including the Apollo Belvedere; 
among the paintings taken was Raphael’s 
Transfiguration. 
“Degenerate” Art
Where Napoleon was concerned with 
scooping up as much of the world’s art 
as he could for France, the Nazis took 
a much more sinister view. The National 
Socialists sought a “purification” of 
art. The Nazis approved only of 
naturalistic art by Scandinavian 
or Teutonic artists, or art that 
illustrated Germanic subject matter 
and nationalistic themes. Abstract 
art or art promoting alternative 
worldviews, even if produced by Germans, 
was considered “degenerate,” as was 
art by Jews, communists, or other non-
Aryan artists.

Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
In 1937, Hitler commissioned Adolf Ziegler to take examples of “degenerate” art 
found within Germany. What resulted was the traveling Exhibition of Depraved 
Art. Its 730 works were shown in the least flattering way possible and framed 
as morally abhorrent. The show, having determined what was unacceptable in 
terms of art, was quickly followed by Ziegler’s theft of such art from German 
citizens. However, the Nazis soon proved they were willing to profit from this 
so-called degeneracy by selling seized works to foreign collectors. The largest 
sale was at the Galerie Fischer in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1939. Any works that 
had not sold at the end were burned in Berlin: 3,825 works on paper and 1,004 
oil paintings and sculptures.
Before the war began, Hitler concocted a scheme to acquire every important 
artwork in Europe to be displayed in a kulturhaupstadt, a cultural capital 
featuring a “super museum” that he would build in his native town of Linz, 
Austria. An estimated 13 miles of galleries were included in the plan. The 
centerpiece of this mammoth collection was to be the Ghent Altarpiece. To fill 
this collection, Hitler established special task forces charged with seizing art 
from Jewish collections.
Artwork stolen and stored in a salt mine

36
Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
At the war’s end, dozens of secret caches of stolen art were discovered, 
including the motherlode at Altaussee, Austria. This was a salt mine that 
had been converted into a high-tech storage depot, holding the thousands 
of masterpieces destined for Linz. In that mine alone, Allied soldiers, led by 
the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives officers, found 6,577 oil paintings, 
2,030 works on paper, 954 prints, 137 statues, 128 pieces of arms and armor, 
79 containers full of decorative arts, 78 pieces of furniture, 122 tapestries, and 
1,500 cases of rare books.
The Amber Room
Of all of the artistic casualties of World War II, few have attracted the enduring 
attention of the Amber Room. Amber, since antiquity, has been highly regarded 
as a material of exceptional beauty. In the early 1700s, Sophia Charlotte, second 
wife of Frederick I of Prussia, encouraged her husband to order a room for their 
palace paneled exclusively in thinly sliced amber veneer. However, it was never 
completed, and their son, Frederick William I, lost interest in the project and 
gave it to Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a diplomatic gift.
The Amber Room

37
Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
Eighteen purpose-built crates were built 
to transport the enormous amber panels 
to St. Petersburg. In 1743, Empress 
Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, 
finally ordered the panels installed at 
her new winter palace. On six different 
occasions over the course of the next 
12 years, she would have the Amber 
Room disassembled, enlarged, and 
installed in a new location within the 
palace. In 1755, she had it relocated to 
the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, 
south of St. Petersburg.
Catherine the Great undertook another 
renovation of the Amber Room, which 
by this point was an imperial status 
symbol. She purchased some 900 
pounds of additional amber at high 
expense and summoned craftsmen from 
Italy to work it. When the Second World 
War began, the room was so famous that it could not avoid being a target for 
the oncoming Nazis. When the Nazis swept into Tsarskoye Selo in September 
1941, the palace staff had created a false room inside the Amber Room, hoping 
to hide it. The ruse failed, however, and the Nazis quickly packed the panels 
into 27 crates and shipped them to Königsberg Castle in Prussia. There, only 
a part of the room was assembled and displayed. Königsberg was heavily 
bombed by the Allies in August 1944, and the Red Army besieged the city for 
three months in early 1945. When the city surrendered in April, fire, artillery 
shelling, and bombing had reduced the castle to ruins.
A Small Ray of Hope
Sadly, even if not looted or destroyed, art often becomes a casualty amid the 
chaos created by war. During the anarchy of the early months of the American 
invasion of Iraq in 2003, an estimated 15,000 objects disappeared in a matter 
of days from the Baghdad Museum of Art. It was first thought that this had 
been a crime of opportunity on a massive scale. However, there was also 

38
Lecture 5 | The War Wing: Art Plundered through Conflict
much more organized looting, as some groups had taken some larger works 
and broken or sawed them into smaller, more portable parts for movement in 
actions that showed advanced planning and required insider knowledge.
However, simultaneously, extraordinary efforts are often made by ordinary 
people to preserve their cultural heritage during times of conflict, risking their 
safety and even their lives to save their common past. During the Malian 
civil war, fundamentalist Islamic forces captured the ancient African oasis of 
Timbuktu and soon set about destroying its ancient landmarks in the name 
of religious cleansing. Amid the occupation, hundreds of locals and families 
risked arrest or worse to smuggle Timbuktu’s collection of ancient manuscripts 
to safe houses or out of the city. These extraordinary efforts saved thousands of 
works of immeasurable value to world heritage.

Lecture 6
The Hall of Vandals: 
Wreckers and Iconoclasts
T
he most contentious galleries of the Museum of Lost Art are those 
lined with paintings and artworks that were deliberately ruined or 
destroyed. As you will see in this lecture, art is often caught in the 
crossfire of religious, social, and political conflict. Wanton violence 
against art can be broadly categorized in two ways: iconoclasm or vandalism. 
Iconoclasm is the targeting of objects for destruction based on what they 
symbolically represent. Vandalism refers to defacing, mutilating, or destroying 
objects or buildings without a particular ideological agenda. The line between 
iconoclasm and vandalism can be contentious because there are mixed 
feelings about the legitimacy of art as targets for ideological agendas.

40
Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
Religious Iconoclasm
Acts of iconoclasm are often justified because the perpetrators do not 
believe what they are destroying can be classified as art or that their creators 
are true artists. The term iconoclasm comes from the Greek words eikon, 
meaning “image,” and klan, meaning “break.” It arose during a period of 
religiously motivated art destruction in the Byzantine Empire in the 8th 
and 9th centuries AD. The preceding centuries had seen a rapid growth in 
religious art—images of Christ, Mary, saints, and angels, some of which 
were thought to be miraculously inspired and venerated in their own right. 
This provoked growing concern from conservative church authorities, who 
believed such art to be “graven images” and thus prohibited by the Ten 
Commandments.
A ban on religious images was first instituted under Emperor Leo III around 
AD 726 and continued until 787. During this period, existing images in 
churches were painted over or 
destroyed. There was a lull between 
AD 787 and 813 and then another 
wave between AD 814 and 842. It 
was a tumultuous and often violent 
time. It is unknown how much 
early Christian art was destroyed in 
the process. It ended with Empress 
Theodora, the wife of Theophilos, 
who was an iconophile. She served 
as regent for her son Michael III 
during the first 13 years of his rule. 
She had the iconoclastic patriarch 
of Constantinople deposed in 
AD 843 and replaced with one 
sympathetic to the veneration of 
icons. From then on, images of 
the members of the Holy Family 
and saints remained a vital part 
of Byzantine, and subsequently 
Orthodox Christian, religion.

Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
Since then, waves of religious iconoclasm have periodically swept across countries 
and continents. For example, tragic incidents were wrought by 15th-century 
Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola. A charismatic public speaker, he rose in 
prominence during the Florentine High Renaissance and persuasively preached 
against corruption in the Catholic Church, exploitation of the poor, and what 
he saw as the immorality of secular art and culture. He announced prophecies 
and then interpreted their fulfillment. This was a time of intense dissatisfaction 
with the ruling Medici family, who were forcibly expelled from Florence that 
year. Savonarola won legions of followers in the city and was installed as leader 
of the Florentine Republic, which he proclaimed a “New Jerusalem.”

42
Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
Part of Savonarola’s mission was to destroy any art that did not conform to 
puritanical religious standards. He encouraged gangs to roam Florence, even 
breaking into private homes to drag out any artworks with subject matter not 
considered sufficiently religious, along with objects associated with personal 
vanity and frivolity, such as mirrors and books. Great piles of these “vanities” 
were burned in enormous bonfires.
Pope Alexander VI was not amused at the Florentine rebellion, particularly 
when Savonarola refused to join his new Holy League against the French threat. 
Savonarola was summoned to Rome but declined the invitation. In 1497, 
Alexander excommunicated the monk. The next year, a rival Florentine preacher 
demanded Savonarola undergo a trial by fire to prove that he was chosen by 
God: If he could walk unharmed through a bonfire, it would show that he 
truly was what he claimed. Savonarola didn’t like this plan. However, when 
he demurred, public opinion quickly shifted against him. He was arrested and 
forced to confess to having invented his prophecies. On May 23, 1498, he was 
hanged, and his body was burned in Piazza della Signoria, on the exact same 
spot where so much art of the Florentine Renaissance had been put to the torch.

Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
A much more extreme strain of Islamic iconoclasm has become prominent 
among certain sects in recent decades, ruthlessly applied even to pre-Islamic 
and ancient art. For instance, ISIS destroyed the ancient city of Nimrūd in 
Iraq in 2015. Nimrūd thrived at the crook of the Tigris and Great Zab Rivers, 
in the heart of Mesopotamia, for six centuries after its construction around 
1250 BC. By the end of the 7th century BC, the Assyrian empire was in steep 
decline, beset by waves of invaders, and Nimrūd was abandoned. Among its 
most notable remnants were the lamassu, colossal statues of mythical creatures 
with the head of a bearded man, wings, and the torso and legs of a lion. It was 
one of these statues that ISIS videoed themselves destroying when they set 
about systematically destroying Nimrūd’s remains. In January 2017, after ISIS 
was driven out of Nimrūd, the site was completely in ruins.
Political Iconoclasm
Political iconoclasm can strike in waves as suddenly and violently as 
religious iconoclasm. Symbols and statues of political regimes are popular 
targets. Yet often, in periods of intense religious or political iconoclasm, the 
motivations of those destroying art can often verge into something more 
akin to vandalism. Mobs that assemble with outwardly religious or political 
motivations inevitably attract individuals who are angry or disaffected and 
often seek vengeance or profit as much as anything else.
Acts of singular iconoclasm are sometimes the most infuriating to understand 
and the hardest to predict and, thus, protect against. The most prominent 
cases do tend to have a political streak behind them. For example, in 
1914, during the height of the struggle for women’s suffrage in the United 
Kingdom, activist Mary Richardson walked into London’s National Gallery 
and attacked The Rokeby Venus by Diego Velázquez with a cleaver, slashing 
the painting seven times. She explained the act as one of political protest 
against traditional depictions of women as objects for the male gaze.
Vandalism
There are also acts whose ideological foundations are more questionable. 
Canadian artist Jubal Brown made headlines in 1996 when he deliberately 
projectile vomited onto two paintings, most famously Piet Mondrian’s 
Composition with Red and Blue, after consuming large amounts of blue gelatin. 

44
Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
His official explanation was that the paintings he targeted were oppressively 
boring and needed color. In reality, this was merely a stunt designed to bring 
him greater public attention and commercial exposure.
Then there are acts of vandalism that arise from random outbursts of mental 
instability. In 1972, a Hungarian-Austrian geologist named Lazlo Toth 
famously entered the Vatican Chapel of Santa Petronilla wielding a geologist’s 
hammer and attacked Michelangelo’s Pietà, crying out, “I am Jesus Christ; 
I have risen from the dead!” He managed to knock off part of Mary’s nose, 
elbow, and eyelids before stunned onlookers mustered the strength to pull 
him down off the statue and subdue him.
Particularly famous works of art, 
such as the Pietà, must be protected 
not only from art thieves wanting 
to steal them but also from vandals 
and protestors seeking attention. 
Art in public spaces naturally 
attracts the most vandalism and, 
though rarely destroyed, often 
requires repeated restoration and 
repair. Though people tend to 
think of the random vandalism of 
public monuments as a fairly new 
phenomenon, it, too, is as old as 
the hills. A prime example is the 
Fountain of Neptune, sculpted in 
1565 by Bartolommeo Ammannati, 
which stands prominently in 
Florence’s main square, Piazza della 
Signoria. The fountain has been 
damaged on numerous occasions 
ever since its completion. It was extensively vandalized and several parts of 
it were stolen as early as January 25, 1580, and it has been repeatedly defiled 
since then. For example, during Carnival in February 1830, thieves stole 
a bronze satyr from the fountain, which was later replaced with a version 
sculpted by Giovanni Pazzi.

45
Lecture 6 | The Hall of Vandals: Wreckers and Iconoclasts
Most acts of art vandalism are isolated, but some target art with great 
determination. For instance, in 1991, the Italian vandal Piero Cannata 
smuggled a hammer into the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence and used 
it to smash a toe off Michelangelo’s David before he was tackled by museum 
visitors. He was judged mentally ill after a trial and hospitalized, but he 
continued to attack artworks after his release. In 1993, he was arrested 
after he defaced a 15th-century fresco by Filippo Lippi at Prato Cathedral. 
Despite being repeatedly committed to psychiatric hospitals, he continued to 
periodically attack art. In his last public act in 2005, he spray-painted a black 
X on the bronze plaque at the center of Piazza della Signoria in Florence, 
which marks the spot where Girolamo Savonarola was burned.

Gallery of Misfortune: Art 
Lost by Accident
T
his lecture concerns the galleries of the Museum of Lost Art where 
works lost to accidents can be found. Artworks are fragile things 
that can be shattered in the blink of an eye. The unpredictable 
heartbreaks of life that cause so much human suffering can just as 
easily destroy art as well. For many of the works in this part of the museum, 
there’s little rhyme or reason to their presence. Random accidents are part of 
the life of art just as much as the life of humans.

47
Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
Fire and The Handmaidens
Fire has long been one of the deadliest threats 
to both human life and works of art. It is not 
certain exactly how many artworks burned 
in the conflagration of the Royal Alcázar in 
1734, but overall more than 500 paintings 
were lost in the blaze. One work that did 
survive has gone on to be considered among 
the most important in the story of art: 
Velázquez’s 1656 self-conscious masterpiece 
Las Meninas, or The Handmaidens.
The setting is the Alcázar Palace, specifically 
Velázquez’s studio. The Infanta Margarita, the 
only surviving child of Philip IV and Mariana of Austria, who appear together 
in the background of the composition, deserves special recognition. Isabel de 
Velasco and Maria Augustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor, the Infanta’s two maids 
of honor, stand on either side of her. There are two dwarves present: the thin 
Italian Nicolasito Pertusato and the stocky German Maria Barbola. Velázquez 
makes an appearance holding a paintbrush and a palette. Representing an artist 
while also portraying other, far more significant people was revolutionary at the 
time. The king and queen are depicted in a mirror at the back of the space.
The front of the painting is a mirror that reflects the scene depicted inside 
it back into Velázquez’s eyes as the viewers stare at it. You can see through 
it, like a pane of one-way glass, but Velázquez and those who are inside the 
painting can only see their own reflections. On the opposite side of the one-
way glass, however, they make eye contact with the viewers by gazing at their 
reflections. They break the fourth wall by letting you know that they are 
aware of the fact that they are objects within a piece of art and that you are 
looking in at them. The philosopher Michel Foucault said that it was the first 
postmodernist piece of art because it was self-aware of its status as a work of 
art and a painting about the act of painting.
Fires in which known, cataloged works were wiped out are relatively few. Many 
of history’s greatest fires have been so destructive and widespread that the full 
extent of the losses is unfathomable. The Great Fire of Rome, for instance, 
Diego Velázquez

48
Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
which decimated the center of the city under the emperor Nero in AD 64, took 
countless works of art with it. However, because the works are not enumerated, 
their loss feels more generically tragic than if you knew of individual pieces 
you might wish had survived. There are also older works whose loss has been 
attributed to fire but for which the evidence is unclear. As fires often befall 
places or items that have become dilapidated or abandoned, they may not be the 
only cause of loss.
One well-known conflagration was the great fires at Whitehall Palace in 
London at the end of the 17th century. The primary London residence of 
English kings from 1530 until 1698, Whitehall Palace had more than 1,500 
rooms. It was a showcase for the collected artistic talent and architectural 
ingenuity of the English realm. On April 10, 1694, a fire swallowed an 
apartment recently occupied by Louise de Kéroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth 
and mistress of Charles II. The blaze damaged some of the older palace 
buildings but did not reach the state apartments. This was followed on January 
4, 1698, by a much worse fire that gutted most of Whitehall, residential and 
governmental. Lost were Michelangelo’s Sleeping Eros, Hans Holbein’s Portrait 
of Henry VIII, and Bernini’s Portrait Bust of King Charles I.
A more recent instance of art being destroyed by fire took place on May 24, 
2004, in Leyton, London, at the Momart storage warehouse, which was being 
used by many galleries and artists to store artwork and 
historical documents. Nearly all of the warehouse’s contents, 
which had a market value of about 50 million pounds 
sterling, were destroyed. These included works by William 
Redgrave, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gavin Turk, Damien 
Hirst, and Tracey Emin.
Nearly Lost at Sea
Water can both destroy and preserve art. Numerous sculptures from 
the ancient world have been saved and preserved thanks to water. 
Bronze sculptures in particular that are lost at sea or submerged in 
shipwrecks usually survive and are frequently in excellent condition 
when recovered. In fact, the majority of large-scale ancient bronze 
sculptures still in existence today were fortunate enough to have 
been shipwrecked, including the Croatian Apoxyomenos, which 
was discovered in 1996 close to Lošinj in the northern Adriatic.

Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
Works of stone are also largely unharmed 
by centuries or even millennia submerged 
on the seafloor. A fixture of London’s 
riverfront embankment, Cleopatra’s 
Needle is a monumental work of stone 
that survives despite a shipwreck. 
A towering obelisk carved with 
hieroglyphics, this and a companion 
obelisk that stands in New York City’s 
Central Park were both carved during the 
reign of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut. 
Carved out of red granite, Cleopatra’s 
Needle weighs in at 224 tons and towers 
some 70 feet into the sky. It was first 
cut around 1450 BC. Cleopatra VII 
built a new temple in Alexandria called 
the Caesareum, dedicated to the cult of 
Rome. Inscriptions on the bronze crabs 
that once supported the two obelisks 
record that they were moved from 
Heliopolis to Alexandria around 13 BC.
Some 1,300 years later, the obelisks fell and were partially 
buried in the sands, which protected their hieroglyphic 
inscriptions from the battering winds of the centuries. In 
1877, a wealthy benefactor offered engineer John Dixon 
£10,000 to devise a way to transport Cleopatra’s Needle 
to London. Dixon’s brother, Waynman Dixon, designed 
a watertight iron cylinder, 92 feet long and 16 feet wide, 
into which the obelisk was rolled down the 
beach. The cylinder was fitted 
out with twin keels, a rudder, 
a mast, and a deckhouse and 
was surrounded by a floating 
pontoon. The plan was to 
have it towed to London by 
the steamship Olga.

Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
The transport ended in disaster. On October 14, 1877, a storm raged over 
the Bay of Biscay, and the cylinder began to roll. A dinghy sent out from the 
Olga to secure it was lost with all six crew members. The decision was taken 
to abandon the obelisk. After the storm passed, the Olga’s captain searched in 
vain for the cylinder pontoon, but it appeared to have been lost, sunk to the 
bottom of the sea. However, Waynman Dixon’s design kept the obelisk afloat, 
and it was rescued and towed to the port of Ferrol by the steamer Fitzmaurice, 
out of Glasgow. On January 21, 1878, the cylinder arrived in England. It was 
erected in London, at Victoria Embankment, on September 12, 1878.

Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
In contrast to works nearly lost but salvaged, innumerable works are still 
missing. The Vrouw Maria, a wooden Dutch merchant ship, sank off the 
coast of Finland on October 9, 1771. She was loaded with cargo that included 
cloth, coffee, sugar, dye, and foodstuffs. There were also the paintings 
Large Herd of Oxen by Paulus Potter and Woman at Her Toilette by Gerard 
Ter Borch. The ship had set out from Amsterdam on September 5, 1771, 
intending to sail to St. Petersburg, but a storm blew her onto rocks off the 
island of Jurmo, Finland. Waves eventually pushed the ship into deeper seas. 
It began to sink despite the crew’s efforts to pump out the water.
For more than 200 years, the Vrouw Maria lay on the seafloor, until it was 
rediscovered in 1999. The low salinity of the Baltic waters helped to preserve 
the ship and the cargo. Divers brought six items from the deck to the surface, 
but the contents of the ship’s cargo hold remain immersed. The holds still 
appear to be secure, and there is a chance that the paintings, though damaged, 
still physically exist and have not disintegrated. If they had been rolled and 
stored in watertight lead boxes, as some valuables at the time were, they might 
even be restorable.
Human Negligence
Human recklessness and negligence also remain 
one of the greatest threats to art. For instance, 
on February 7, 1845, William Mulcahy, an 
impoverished student tottering from a week of 
heavy drinking, found himself in the British 
Museum. When an attendant was out of 
the room, he threw a lump of loose basalt 
from an exhibit at a glass case containing 
the Portland Vase, smashing both case 
and vase completely. The Portland Vase, 
a rare work of Roman cameo glass, had 
managed to survive the fall of the Roman 
Empire and countless other disasters, only 
to be shattered at the hands of a drunkard. 
Fortunately, the vase was painstakingly 
reassembled and repaired, although the damage 
is still visible today.

Lecture 7 | Gallery of Misfortune: Art Lost by Accident
Children, of course, are another source of accidental damage. Kids in school 
groups touching, bumping, elbowing, and even knocking over art happens all 
the time. In 2015, a 12-year-old boy tripped and fell while visiting the Huashan 
Creative Park in Taiwan, puncturing Paolo Porpora’s Flowers. Though the 
canvas was ripped, restorationists quickly put the painting right again.
Negligent acts of artistic destruction can often come despite the sincere efforts 
of their perpetrators to do good. There’s probably an interesting corridor in the 
Museum of Lost Art paved with good intentions. Amateur restorations have 
produced some of the most poignant of art losses. No incident is more famous 
in recent years than the attempt in 2012 by Cecilia Giménez, an octogenarian 
parishioner of the Sanctuary of Mercy church in Borja, Spain, to restore a fresco 
by the Spanish painter Elías García Martínez depicting Jesus crowned with 
thorns, known as Ecce Homo (Behold the Man). Lacking the skill or experience 
to complete the job, the resulting restoration by Giménez obscured most of 
Christ’s features. It resulted in a vaguely simian-looking nightmare that was 
dubbed by some as Ecce Mono, or “behold the monkey.”

Disaster Wing: Art against 
the Forces of Nature
O
n August 24, AD 79, the volcano called Mount Vesuvius began 
a two-day eruption. A geyser shot 20 miles into the sky, spewing 
out lava and ash at a rate of around 1.5 million tons per second. 
In addition to people and animals, the eruption smothered whole 
towns’ worth of art beneath layers of ash and pumice. As you will learn in this 
lecture, even the most cataclysmic of natural disasters can be a double-edged 
sword. The wonders of ancient Pompeii would never have been preserved as 
well as they are had they not been encased in ash and lava and buried for so 
long. Some works lost to natural disaster may again be found, all or in part. 
Welcome to the Museum of Lost Art’s wing of forces of nature.

Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Earthquakes and Ancient Wonders
Many great wonders have been lost to seismic activity, including three of the 
seven great wonders of the ancient world. Perhaps the most iconic of the three 
was the Colossus of Rhodes. Portraying the sun god Helios, the bronze statue 
stood at the entrance to the Mandraki Harbor on the island of Rhodes. It 
was made to commemorate the victorious resistance of the people of Rhodes 
against a siege by Antigonus I, ruler of Macedon, in 305 BC. Begun in 292 
BC and completed 12 years later, the statue was designed by Chares of Lindos.
The monumental statue stood on a 50-foot-high marble plinth for 54 years 
before a violent earthquake struck Rhodes in 226 BC. The colossus broke at the 
knees, toppling over and crashing backward to the ground. The Greek historian 
and geographer Strabo wrote that in his day, the broken body of the statue and 
the stone feet and plinth still lay exactly where they had fallen. In its broken 
state, the colossus was a destination site for curious travelers. It was only in AD 
653 that an Arab army under Muawiyah I captured the island of Rhodes and, 
according to Theophanes the Confessor, melted down the bronze in the statue. 
A Jewish merchant from Edessa is said to have bought the metal, requiring 900 
camels to carry it off.

55
Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Only a few days’ sail from Rhodes, at the port of Alexandria, Ptolomy I Soter 
ordered the construction of a lighthouse, or Pharos, upon the Nile delta 
between around 286 and 246 BC. The lighthouse was a limestone tower 
with a furnace at its peak. It was an aesthetic accomplishment as much as an 
engineering one. Large blocks of lightly colored stone were laid down in three 
tapering tiers—the bottom square, the middle octagonal, and the uppermost 
circular, topped by a statue of Poseidon. Yet, its height left it vulnerable, and it 
was damaged in a series of earthquakes beginning in AD 956. A final tremor 
in 1323 left it in ruins.
The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was an elaborate tomb that was built for 
Mausolus of Caria by his widow and sister, Artemisia. Mausolus was a satrap, 
or regional governor, of the Persian imperial outpost of Halicarnassus, on 
the southwest coast of what is now Turkey. He lends his name to all later 
mausoleums. A roughly square structure up to 130 feet high, his tomb was 
decorated all around with freestanding statues and sculptural reliefs. The latter 
depicted battles between the Lapiths and the centaurs and between the Greeks 
and the Amazons. The mausoleum survived numerous attacks on the city and 
stood watch over the port for 1,600 years. Sadly, it was destroyed by earthquakes 
from the 12th to the 15th centuries, and by 1404 only the base remained 
standing. The Knights of Saint John of Rhodes constructed Bodrum Castle in 
1494 using some of the mausoleum’s debris. The remainder was used in 1522 
to increase the city’s fortifications in preparation for an Ottoman invasion.

Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Even today’s admirable technology, which can sometimes predict earthquakes, 
cannot protect monuments. For instance, a 1997 earthquake wrought havoc 
that might have been reversible had not the restorers botched the job—a sort of 
artistic manslaughter, at least according to some. The famous frescoes by Giotto 
and other luminaries at the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi were damaged when 
an earthquake struck the area around the Umbrian town of Assisi. A team of 
conservators was tasked with saving the frescoes and restoring them to their pre-
quake state. The project was initially deemed a success when the conservators 
finished their work and the frescoes in the Chapel of St. Nicholas were once 
again on display. However, it soon became apparent that the chiaroscuro, the 
dramatic contrast of light and shadow of the original work, was lost.
Floods and Salvaging
Many areas of Italy are already prone to flooding, and her cultural treasures 
have often been threatened by them. In Florence, for example, 8 serious floods 
had been recorded since 1333. By far the worst, though, was the flood of 
November 4–5, 1966. An estimated 8 feet of rain fell over 2 days. The banks 
of the normally tranquil Arno River burst, and the tightly grouped wonders 
of the Renaissance that cluster in the small city center were simultaneously 
endangered. The Basilica of Santa Croce, dating from 1296, was the worst 
affected, standing almost 10 feet deep in river water.

Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Volunteers flew in from around the world to carefully excavate books, 
manuscripts, artworks, and masonry from layers of thick mud mixed with oil 
and sewage. By some estimates, millions of cultural objects were lost: around 
3 million books and manuscripts and some 14,000 movable art objects, of 
which 1,500 or so were significant artworks. Masterpieces ruined include 
Paolo Uccello’s fresco Creation and the Fall and the mighty wooden Crucifix 
by Cimabue, forefather of Renaissance Florentine painting.
From the tragedy emerged some important positives, however. The Opificio 
delle Pietre Dure—literally “Workshop of Semi-Precious Stones”—was 
established in Florence and is now one of the world’s foremost institutes of 
art restoration and conservation. In the wake of the flood, new techniques for 
preserving manuscripts and detaching frescoes from walls were developed. 
Creation and the Fall by Paolo Uccello

58
Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Restoration technology had advanced around this time in terms of analyzing 
art with various light spectra, such as X-rays. However, the physical 
manipulation of damaged art, including cleaning, restoration, and prevention 
of further deterioration, had seen relatively little major improvement 
before 1966.
Suddenly, the world’s attention was focused on salvaging art that often was 
not portable. For instance, Giorgio Vasari’s monumental five-panel Last 
Supper was caked in the mud that engulfed Santa Croce. Conservators now 
had to deal with cleaning works of mud and debris. Reattaching flaking paint 
and keeping the supports from contorting too much in the humidity changes 
were the primary concerns.
One technique used in the immediate aftermath of the flood on water-
damaged works on panel was to apply strips of Japanese mulberry paper to 
the painted surface, brushed with a layer of methacrylate resin to make them 
stick. This method was used to reattach bits of paint that had flaked loose 
when the underlayer of gesso grew unstable due to moisture. Works were 
allowed to dry slowly, but changes in humidity inevitably led to curvature 
of the wooden supports, the painted panels, or the wooden framework 
behind the canvas and caused the paint to crack. Ciro Castelli came up with 
a technique to prevent the panels from contracting too much by stuffing 
a filler of poplar wood into incisions made on the back of the panel.
Then, there was the issue of getting damaged frescoes off of walls. A fresco 
is a painting in which pigment is applied directly to wet plaster on a wall or 
ceiling. The strappo technique—used to transfer frescoes, with their plaster 
intact, onto a portable support—was developed in Florence after the 1966 
flood. A linen cloth is applied to the fresco and painted with a diluted bone 
glue. This attaches the paint to the linen in a way that is reversible, without 
damaging the paint itself. The final coat of plaster onto which the fresco is 
painted is then cut away from the rest of the wall with a scalpel. The result 
is a “sandwich” of linen, paint, and plaster. The back of the plaster is then 
pumiced to smoothness and covered with canvas, and the linen front is 
moistened. Once wet, the bone glue in the linen releases its grip on the paint, 
and the fabric can be peeled away. Thus, what was once an integral part of an 
immobile plastered wall becomes a painting still attached to a thin layer of 
plaster but now affixed to a fresh canvas for display in a museum.

59
Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
The Danger of Nature
All but the hardiest of artworks must be protected against the damage of 
natural forces if they are to survive for future generations. One city that has 
been fighting and often losing the battle against nature is Venice. The humidity 
of Venice is such that frescoes fade and the plaster on which they are painted 
begins to flake off within only a few decades of their completion. One need 
look no further for examples than the frescoes that once adorned the exterior 
of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. In 
1508, the year it was completed, a dazzling series of frescoes was unveiled on 
the facade facing the Grand Canal, painted by a pair of young Venetian artists, 
Titian and Giorgione. However, thanks to the relentless Venetian humidity, 
little remains of the frescoes, which were transferred to the Ca’ d’Oro in 1966.
The ancient works that remain to us today are usually a product of protection 
of the elements and unusually hardy mediums. Yet, the art that survives the 
forces of time is often transformed nonetheless. The image of ancient Greek 
and Roman cities and statuary in the public memory is of pure white marble 
and ivory-hued travertine. However, in fact, they were explosions of color, 
with gaudily painted temples and the walls of buildings from baths to brothels 
decorated in fresco or jeweled with mosaic. Classical sculptures were often 
luridly painted, too.

60
Lecture 8 | Disaster Wing: Art against the Forces of Nature
Excavations on the Athenian acropolis around 1832 contributed to what 
became known as the polychromy debate. Residual pigments were found on 
the ancient buildings, suggesting that they had been brightly painted. The 
excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum ended the argument, showing the 
painted ancient cities in their original glory. Many centuries of weathering 
have caused nearly all traces of pigments to vanish from these works.

Lecture 9
No Bequest: Art Destroyed 
by Artists and Owners
Y
ou’ve now reached one of the more unusual wings of the Museum 
of Lost Art—where you find the art that has been destroyed by 
its creators and patrons. The act of artists destroying their own 
creations is largely a modern-day phenomenon. Apart from rare 
occurrences, artists prior to the modern era were either unable to afford to 
destroy their work or didn’t possess it to do so. However, as shown in this 
lecture, this did not preclude artists from destroying their studies, drawings, 
and other works that went into the preparation of their masterpieces.

62
Lecture 9 | No Bequest: Art Destroyed by Artists and Owners
Recycling
One historical form of artistic destruction by artists themselves involved acts 
of recycling. Vellum and drawing paper were pricey during the Renaissance. 
As a result, sketches were frequently drawn on both the front and back of 
paper and vellum. Canvases and boards might also be reused, with layers 
of paint concealing previous work. Overpainting that conceals mistakes or 
makes changes to compositions is not unusual, and many famous works were 
altered at some stage of their development. Occasionally, artists decided to 
paint over a work entirely and start afresh, and these willful acts of erasure 
can reveal much about an artist and their processes.
For example, in 2019, X-ray and ultraviolet analysis showed that the portrait 
Saint Catherine of Alexandria by Artemisia Gentileschi had two previous 
works beneath its surface. The first seems to have been in preparation 
for a work that was never realized and thus completely painted over. The 
second was a self-portrait of the artist herself, from which art historians 
have concluded that Gentileschi used herself as a model for her paintings of 
historical figures, erasing her own visage as she built up one of others.
Overpainting can also be part of 
the artistic statement of a work. In 
2015, X-rays of Kazimir Malevich’s 
famous Black Square showed that 
there were two hidden paintings 
there. According to the description, 
the lowest original image on the 
canvas is a vibrant Cubo-Futurist 
piece that Malevich experimented 
with around 1910. The aesthetic fused 
Futurist ideas of breaking free from 
the past and aiming for completely 
new aesthetic vocabularies with the 
Cubist technique of fragmenting 
an image into geometric forms seen from various points of view. A proto-
Suprematist composition was visible underneath Black Square and above 
that painting. Malevich was the leader of the Suprematism movement, 
which rejected representational art in favor of rigid geometric forms. 
Black Square by Kazimir Malevich

63
Lecture 9 | No Bequest: Art Destroyed by Artists and Owners
For Malevich, the rejection of traditional art was a statement of independence 
in keeping with the revolutionary mood of the time: Black Square was 
a deliberate act of destroying what had come before.
At the Hands of the Artist
There are also cases of artists outright destroying 
their artistic works. Often, the motivation 
comes from a deep sense of dissatisfaction with 
a work and perhaps a touch of perfectionism. 
For instance, in 1908, shortly before their 
scheduled exhibition at Galerie Durand-Ruel in 
Paris, Claude Monet decided he was sufficiently 
unhappy with what he had produced in his 
famous Water Lilies series that he destroyed at 
least 15 of the canvases. Monet long suffered from 
depression, and his water lilies came late in his 
artistic career, when his vision 
and art were being affected by 
the development of cataracts 
in his eyes. Many accounts 
attest that he frequently 
destroyed his own works 
when he felt they did not live 
up to his standards.
Although the majority of 
instances of artist-destroyed 
art can be attributed to 
a certain degree of conceit 
or perfectionism, there 
have been cases where other 
reasons were at play. After 
a scuffle with his fiancé Tulla 
Larsen in which shots ended up being fired, the Norwegian painter Edvard 
Munch famously sawed his portrait of the two of them in half. However, in 
the end, Tulla’s half was not destroyed and was eventually reunited by the 
Munch estate with its original pairing, now a diptych.

Fits of Pique
Throughout the history of portraiture, 
wise artists have flattered their sitters. 
Whatever the artist may think of the 
sitter, it is they who have to be pleased for 
the artist to be paid. Thus, clever artists 
worked around aesthetic imperfections 
to provide reasonable likenesses in which 
the objectionable bits were “airbrushed.” 
Problems could certainly arise, though. 
The French painter Anne-Louis Girodet 
de Roussy-Trioson was commissioned in 
1798 to make a portrait of actress Anne 
Françoise Elisabeth Lange as a gift to her 
newlywed husband. Girodet painted Lange 
as the Roman goddess Venus. However, 
Lange disliked the painting intensely, 
offering only half of the originally agreed 
price and penning a sharp critique of the 
work and Girodet’s artistic talents.
Furious, Girodet cut up his original 
portrait and immediately began a new 
version. This time, he depicted Lange as 
the mythological figure Danae—traditionally depicted at the moment of her 
insemination by Zeus, who had taken the guise of a shower of golden rain 
to steal her virginity. Lange is depicted as though greedily seizing upon the 
coins, helped in her task by a winged child—a coded reference to a daughter 
she had through an affair with a banker. Peacock feathers, representing vanity, 
are to be found everywhere, while the turkey, with a ring around a toe, is 
a none-too-flattering representation of Lange’s new husband, for whom the 
portrait was originally intended. Humiliated when the new portrait was put 
on public display, Lange went into self-imposed exile to Italy for the rest of her 
life. For his part, Girodet seems to have regretted taking their argument so far 
and later refused to show his painting to anyone.

Patron-Destroyed Art
Mexican painter and muralist Diego Rivera’s unyielding politics allowed him 
to get his art rejected on a far grander scale than a lone portrait. His Man at the 
Crossroads was a mural created in 1934 and the star attraction at the Rockefeller 
Center in New York—until the Rockefeller family had it destroyed. Politically 
conservative John D. Rockefeller Jr. perhaps chose poorly when he decided to 
work with Rivera, a member of the Mexican Communist Party.
The original preparatory sketch showed a soldier, a peasant, and a worker 
holding hands at the center of a vast, multi-figure design. When Rivera 
began to paint the final work on the wall, he and his assistants changed some 
of the composition without getting approval. Recent scholarship suggests 
that Rivera was scorned and teased by his left-wing colleagues and the 
communist groups with which he sympathized for having “sold out” to an 
exemplar of conservative capitalism. The artist thus allegedly instructed an 
assistant to find a picture of Lenin from which he could work, saying, “If 
you want communism, I will paint communism.” Adding insult to injury, 
Rivera included a portrait of Rockefeller drinking martinis with a harlot. 
Man at the Crossroads by Diego Rivera

66
Lecture 9 | No Bequest: Art Destroyed by Artists and Owners
The orientation was such that Lenin was on one side and Rockefeller on the 
other, and Lenin came out looking the better of the two. Soon, the press got 
ahold of the story, which made headlines amid the anti-communist climate of 
1930s America. In the end, the mural was chiseled off the wall.
Sometimes, a patron’s motivation for destroying art simply defies classification. 
On May 15, 1990, Japanese businessman Ryoei Saito bought van Gogh’s Portrait 
of Dr. Gachet for $82.5 million. Later, he declared that he wanted the van Gogh 
painting to be cremated alongside him. The art world was concerned that one of 
van Gogh’s masterpieces would be lost despite efforts by coworkers to reassure 
them that this was merely a figure of speech expressing the owner’s love for the 
artwork. Although Saito later said he would think about leaving the painting to 
a museum in his will, the painting hasn’t been seen since he passed away in 1996.
Saito had also paid $78.1 million for the smaller of two Renoir paintings, 
Bal du moulin de la Galette. It ended up being used as collateral for loans to 
Saito’s businesses and was eventually sold by the banks when those businesses 
experienced financial difficulties. It is believed to be in a private Swiss 
collection but has not been seen either since 1990.

Lecture 9 | No Bequest: Art Destroyed by Artists and Owners
Vision of Destruction
There is a small category of cases where the destruction of the art was 
conceived as part of the artistic vision from the first. In 2018, in an infamous 
viral incident, the Sotheby’s auction house in London auctioned off British 
street artist Banksy’s Girl with Balloon for a little more than £1 million. Girl 
with Balloon was one of the murals that had brought Banksy to widespread 
attention since it debuted in 2002. The version under auction was rare, as it 
had been uniquely created for a friend of the artist in 2006 and mounted in 
an elaborate frame that included a built-in lighting system.
However, Banksy had also secretly installed a shredder within the frame, 
powered by the same system that powered the built-in lighting, intended to 
be remotely activated and destroy the work should it ever go up for auction. 
When the hammer fell, a siren within the painting whirred, and Girl with 
Balloon began shredding itself. In an apparent fault, the shredding was only 
half completed when the mechanism stopped. Banksy soon revealed his hand 
in the event. The partially destroyed work was renamed Love Is in the Bin.

The Basement: Strange 
and Unsolved Cases
I
n this lecture, you will tiptoe down the back stairs and go down to 
the Museum of Lost Art’s basement. Here, you will find the countless 
works of art that have fallen through the cracks, lost under unusual 
circumstances or in unorthodox ways. Many artworks down here are no 
more than vague descriptions in the history books or for which there are 
only supposed copies and reconstructions. Often, there is little information 
about their ultimate fate.

Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
Trails Gone Cold
Public sculpture often finds itself vulnerable to changing political whims. The 
vandalism wing contains thousands of former political leaders in stone and 
bronze. However, few have found their destruction proposed by Congress, as 
Horatio Greenough’s The Rescue was in 1939. A joint resolution to the House 
of Representatives recommended that the statue “be ground into dust, and 
scattered to the four winds, that no more remembrance may be perpetuated 
of our barbaric past.” The declaration was understandable. Greenough’s work, 
completed in 1850, depicts a Native American with a tomahawk threatening 
a family of white settlers but being forcibly restrained by a heroic frontiersman. 
The statue sat at the steps of the east flank of the US Capitol building, where 
more than a dozen presidents would be inaugurated in its shadow.
In 1958, The Rescue and its sister statue, 
The Discovery of America, by Luigi Persico were 
hauled off their plinths and put into storage—
nominally in preparation for the extension of the US 
Capitol building. However, they were never restored 
to their former positions. In 1976, while being 
moved to a new storage area by crane, The Rescue 
was dropped, allegedly by accident, breaking into 
several fragments. It hasn’t been seen in public since.

Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
Although the fate of The Rescue is thoroughly documented in government 
reports and court transcripts, the trail goes completely cold for many works. 
One such case of loss involves a famous samurai sword, or katana, made by 
the great Japanese swordsmith Gorō Nyūdō Masamune. Masamune’s swords 
are legendary pieces of art and craftsmanship in Japan. However, one sword, 
the Honjō Masamune, is missing. According to legend, the sword got its 
name from the samurai general Honjō Shigenaga, who gained it after a battle 
in 1561. He took it as a trophy and carried it until around 1595, when he sold 
it to Toyotomi Hidetsugu. From there, the blade passed through numerous 
hands. Its last known owner was Tokugawa Iemasa. It was classified as 
a national treasure of Japan in 1939.
A fragmented and suspect story of its fate states that in December 1945, 
following the defeat of Japan and the end of World War II, Tokugawa Iemasa 
brought the Honjō Masamune and the rest of his sword collection to the 
police station in Mejiro, a district in Tokyo. They remained there until 
January 1946, when the police handed over the swords to someone who 
appeared to be an Allied officer, identified as “Sgt. Coldy Bimore.” He was 
ostensibly from the Foreign Liquidations Commission of the Army Forces of 
the Western Pacific, but there was no reason to believe that this was the man’s 
real identity. Furthermore, it is not clear why the police would hand over such 
treasures. Nevertheless, none of the swords taken have been seen again.
The Mystery of The Battle of Anghiari
The Battle of Anghiari is one of Leonardo da Vinci’s most intriguing lost 
works because there is an air of mystery and debate as to whether it truly ever 
was lost or simply never was. The mystery lies within the Palazzo Vecchio, 
specifically the magnificent Sala dei Cinquecento. The soaring walls of this 
vast meeting hall are painted with larger-than-life-size frescoes of riding and 
ranting warriors. Four enormous battle scenes show the military triumphs 
of the Medici family, painted in 1563 by Giorgio Vasari. These frescoes are 
considered masterworks of 16th-century painting. They are also intriguing 
for another reason: Hiding behind one of Vasari’s frescoes could be a lost 
painting by da Vinci.

71
Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
Of the lost Leonardo, the known facts are these: In the 14th century, the 
Sala dei Cinquecento functioned as the reception room used by the Medicis 
when hosting visiting dignitaries. In 1505, during a brief period when the 
Medici family was expelled from Florence, Leonardo began a monumental 
wall painting in the sala, The Battle of Anghiari: a torqued melee of riders 
and swordsmen. However, he never finished it. His partial fresco is known 
only by a number of copies and an engraving. It seems that Leonardo painted 
merely a small portion of one wall. Some 50 years after the Medici family’s 
return to power, Duke Cosimo de’ Medici commissioned Giorgio Vasari to 
repaint the sala with battle scenes of great Florentine (that is, Medici) victories. 
Vasari fulfilled his commission, but the question remains: What happened to 
Leonardo’s The Battle of Anghiari?
In 1975, Maurizio Seracini, now a leading expert in Italian art, discovered 
what he believed to be a clue to the work’s whereabouts: a tiny bit of text 
hidden within Vasari’s frescoes in the Sala dei Cinquecento. Throughout the 
entire room, on one 177-foot-long frescoed wall, Vasari had painted exactly 
two words: “Cerca trova” (“Seek and you shall find”). Seracini believes this to 
be a clue. Vasari’s fresco, he says, is covering up the lost Leonardo.

72
Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
In 2006, Seracini announced that he had discovered a 1.5-inch hollow gap 
behind Vasari’s frescoed wall and the outer wall of the sala. This double wall, 
which Vasari must have built when he painted his frescoes, is unheard of and 
has no architectural or structural rationale. Further, the gap is only behind the 
wall with the words “Cerca trova” written on it. With this evidence in hand, it 
was announced in 2011 that National Geographic would co-fund the search 
for the lost fresco, and permission was granted to begin in 2012. Within a few 
months, Seracini and his team announced that they had located a paint sample 
on the hidden wall by drilling through the Vasari fresco. The black paint sample 
matched the chemical composition of paints used in other known Leonardo 
paintings. However, in August 2012, the project was put on hold due to protests 
from art historians, aghast at the prospect of damaging the Vasari frescoes.
To find the Leonardo, 
you need to understand 
Giorgio Vasari, who was 
nothing if not reverent 
of his fellow artists. An 
elaborate act to preserve 
a fellow artist’s work would 
not be unprecedented. 
Duke Cosimo de’ Medici 
asked Vasari to renovate 
the interior of the venerable 
Dominican church of 
Santa Maria Novella in 
1568. Part of this included 
sacrificing Masaccio’s 
fresco of the Holy Trinity 
to replace it with Vasari’s 
new Madonna of the Rosary 
painting. On that occasion, 
Giorgio protected the old 
fresco by building a new 
wall in front of it with only 
a small gap, preserving the 
prior fresco.

Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
That Vasari took such pains to preserve Masaccio’s fresco speaks volumes about 
his respect for fellow artists. As such, Seracini argues that there has never been 
any danger of “destroying” the Vasari, who might have used a similar technique 
to preserve the Leonardo. Several techniques exist to wholly remove a fresco 
from the wall to check what lies beneath and to either replace it as it was or 
transfer it elsewhere for display.

Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
That said, no one seems to have considered that “Cerca trova” might refer to 
something other than the lost Leonardo. At the very least, the architectural 
dimensions of the sala were radically changed with Vasari’s remodeling: 
Its walls and ceilings soar far higher than was the case when Leonardo 
began his work there. It’s almost impossible that Leonardo’s work lies behind 
where “Cerca trova” is written, as it would have to be much lower down 
on the wall.
Lost on Purpose
In Los Angeles, Bas Jan Ader, a Dutch conceptual artist, left Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts, by himself in a small sailboat in July 1975 with the 
intention of sailing across the Atlantic from New England to England. His 
final performance would be a play titled In Search of the Miraculous. His 
boat, a 12.5-foot Guppy 13, which he had named Ocean Wave, was the 
smallest ever used to attempt to cross the Atlantic and was not designed for 
transoceanic travel.
“Cerca trova”

75
Lecture 10 | The Basement: Strange and Unsolved Cases
A choir singing sea shanties around a piano in the gallery of his Los Angeles 
dealer marked the beginning of the performance, which was set to conclude 
with another sing-along in Falmouth, England. The journey served as the 
performance’s focal point.
Three weeks later, radio communication with Ader was lost. Ten months later, 
in April 1976, Ocean Wave was discovered empty and bobbing vertically in 
the waves 150 miles off the coast of Ireland. It was found by a Spanish fishing 
vessel, which towed it to the town of A Coruña. Ader is assumed to have 
drowned. However, he was an experienced sailor. Was he that convinced he 
could make the crossing yet overcome by the sea? Or did he perhaps intend 
this voyage to be suicide-as-performance art? Did he create the most literal 
work of lost art?

Lecture 11
Not in the Vault: Fabled 
Art That Never Was
T
his lecture concerns the library of the Museum of Lost Art, where 
stories of myths and mysteries line the shelves. El Dorado, the 
Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Three Sacred Treasures of 
Japan, which you will learn about in this lecture, may be some of the 
most important art ever to be lost, or they may never have existed to begin 
with. In a way, all lost art, given enough time, becomes little more than 
a thing of legend.

77
Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
Lost Cities
Were cities such as El Dorado and Atlantis purely imaginary, or were they 
part real, part legend? The legend of El Dorado, the city made of gold, sounds 
like an expansion of the tales told by the Spanish conquistadors of ancient 
cities merely rich in gold and silver, not made of it. The story began as that 
of El Hombre Dorado, “The Golden Man”—the descriptive used by Spanish 
observers who described the initiation ceremonies of a chieftain carried out 
by the Muisca people in what is now Colombia. The rites involved the new 
chieftain covering himself in gold dust.
This story and name were conflated with a search during the late 16th 
century for a city of gold called Manoa, which was said to be on the shores of 
the legendary Lake Parime. On his deathbed, a captain called Juan Martinez 
described how, in 1520, he’d come upon Manoa while lost and spent seven 
months there. His account prompted Sir Walter Raleigh to become one of 
many adventurers to search for this mythical city. There was gold in great 
quantities in Central and South America, and these stories, written in letters 
or passed orally from man to man until they returned to Spain, helped to 
encourage the funding of further expeditions. It is not difficult to see how 
such stories might have been embellished and augmented until explorers 
imagined an entire city paved with gold bricks.

Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
Another famous lost city, Atlantis, began its existence as an allegory in Plato’s 
dialogues, Timaeus and the unfinished Critias, about the hubris of nation-
states. The fuller description is in the Timaeus, in which the story is told of the 
island nation that lost its godlike element over many generations and eventually 
fought a war with Athens, whose people refused to accept being enslaved by the 
Atlanteans. Athens won, and after a day and night of earthquakes and floods, 
the island of Atlantis sunk into the sea.
This story has captured the imagination of many writers. A 19th-century 
scholar, Ignatius L. Donnelly, helped to popularize the myth in his Atlantis: 
The Antediluvian World of 1882, which misconstrued Plato’s writing as 
a literal historical account. The public had already been encouraged to believe 
that Atlantis was a real lost city when it featured in Jules Verne’s popular 1870 
novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea.
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
Some ancient monuments were revered for eons as the pinnacles of artistic 
achievement, yet their existence is unclear. Take, for example, the Hanging 
Gardens of Babylon. King Nebuchadnezzar II was meant to have built the 
gardens in the ancient city of Babylon for 
his wife, Queen Amytis, who missed the 
green landscape of her home in Media, 
today’s northern Iran.
The gardens were meant to have been 
a series of tiers planted with all manner 
of greenery at each level and also lined 
with colonnades. The Greek historian 
Diodorus Siculus stated the walls were 22 
feet thick, with walkways 10 feet wide. 
He described the structure, meant to 
hold soil and moisture, as made initially 
of brick bonded with cement, a layer of 
bitumen, and then a layer of lead. All of 
this was then piled with soil and “thickly 
planted with trees of every kind that, by 
their great size or other charm, could give 
pleasure to the beholder.”
Hanging Gardens of Babylon

79
Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
Since the classical era, the lost Hanging Gardens have captivated the 
imagination of poets, writers, and artists as one of the seven wonders of the 
ancient world. However, no known Babylonian texts refer to gardens at all. 
Recent scholarship suggests that the Babylonian gardens might have been 
conflated with gardens built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in Nineveh, 
some 100 miles to the north of Babylon. Archaeologists have found a 50-
mile network of waterways, comprising aqueducts, canals, and dams, along 
with a series of water-raising screws that could have raised the water uphill 
to irrigate the gardens. If there was a similar garden in Babylon, it might 
have been damaged, destroyed, or its materials reused over the millennia of 
invaders, including the Assyrians.
The Labyrinth of the Minotaur
Archaeological remains can sometimes give tangible clues that can provide 
at least suggestions as to where various legendary stories might have sprung 
from. For instance, the Greek myths tell of the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, 
who was imprisoned by King Minos in a labyrinth designed by the inventor 
Daedalus. The myth of the labyrinth has loomed so large in our historical 
memory that the word has entered the common lexicon. Various depictions 
of it can be found throughout the history of art. Could there be any truth to 
a structure as fantastic as described?

Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
When the Bronze Age palace at Knossos on Crete was discovered at the end 
of the 19th century, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans found an elaborate 
warren of corridors and rooms. It led him to conclude that the palace itself 
was the labyrinth of legend. However, it is not the only candidate for the 
Minotaur’s lair.
In 2009, a team of archaeologists began to explore an ancient stone quarry on 
the south side of Crete, near Gortyn, the ancient Roman capital of the island. 
The quarry is riddled with 2.5 miles of tunnels, which some think make up 
a more compelling site for the mythical labyrinth than the Bronze Age palace. 
Long called the Labyrinthos Caves, they were believed by tourists from the 
12th to the 19th centuries to be the site of the Minotaur legend. This was 
before the discovery of the ruins of Knossos. Gortyn or Knossos? Each claims 
association with a place of legend that may have indeed been lost and now 
found—or which may never 
have existed at all.
Religious Relics
The Holy Grail, the cup from 
which Christ is believed to 
have drunk at the Last Supper 
and/or which was used to 
catch some of his blood as 
he hung upon the cross, is 
an invention of medieval 
romances. The first known 
written reference comes as 
late as 1190, in the fictional 
epic Perceval, ou Le Conte 
du Graal by Chrétien de 
Troyes. Indeed, the Grail is 
more of a presence in pagan 
Celtic mythology than in 
anything Christian. There is 
no mention of it in biblical 
source material.

81
Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
Similarly, the Ark of the Covenant was supposedly a wooden chest in which the 
two stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments were stored. According 
to the book of Exodus, God instructed Moses to build the Ark out of acacia 
wood to exact specifications during his 40-day stay upon Mount Sinai. It was 
to be covered in gold, adorned with rings, and topped by a golden lid on top of 
which two golden cherubs were to sit. Though there are numerous references to 
the Ark in both biblical and Rabbinic accounts, there is no agreement on what 
became of it or whether it truly ever existed.
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has, for many centuries, maintained that 
the Ark is both real and that it was saved and taken to the city of Aksum by 
Menelik, son of King Solomon, who founded there the Ethiopian empire. 
There the ark remains, supposedly under lock and key at the Church of St. 
Mary of Zion. No one may even enter the Ark’s chamber, save a virgin monk 
who is its sole custodian. The nature of its protection means that its existence 
has not been independently verified there. Most historians believe that if the 
Ark ever did exist as a wooden box, it’s most likely to have disintegrated over 
its 3,000-year history.

The Three Sacred Treasures of Japan
What of relics the provenance and 
evidence of which are intentionally 
kept from view? This is the case with 
the Imperial Regalia of Japan, or the 
Three Sacred Treasures of Japan. They 
are said to include a mirror called Yata 
no Kagami, representing the virtue 
of wisdom; a sword called Kusanagi, 
representing valor; and a jewel called 
Yasakani no Magatama, representing 
benevolence. Whether these treasures 
exist is an open question and possibly 
a matter of faith.
Dating back to AD 690, these items 
are traditionally presented to the 
emperors of Japan by priests during 
coronation ceremonies. Tradition 
says that they were brought down to 
Earth by the ancestor of the Japanese 
imperial line, Ninigi-no-Mikoto. They 
were given to him by his grandmother, 
goddess of the sun, Amaterasu, who 
sent him down from the heavens to 
bring peace to warring Japan.
Amaterasu was said to have hidden 
from her brother, Susanoo-no-Mikoto, 
taking shelter in a cave and causing the world to grow dark. The goddess 
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto hung the mirror and the jewel outside the cave’s 
entrance as a trick to draw her out. Amaterasu saw her reflection in the mirror 
and was startled long enough for the gods to pull her from the cave. To 
apologize for having driven his sister into hiding, Susanoo presented her with 
the sword, which he had acquired from an eight-headed serpent called Yamata 
no Orochi. The first emperor of Japan, Jimmu, Ninigi’s great-grandson, was 
said to have inherited the Treasures from him.

83
Lecture 11 | Not in the Vault: Fabled Art That Never Was
There are shifting stories of the Treasures having been lost and found. 
A battle was fought on the Kanmom Straits in 1185, when the emperor at the 
time, Antoku, was only eight. To avoid capture, his grandmother threw the 
emperor, the Sacred Treasures, and herself out of the boat and into the sea. 
The mirror was recovered, and the jewel was later found by divers; however, 
the sword remained lost. Some say that a new sword was forged, others that 
a decoy had been thrown into the water. Yet others believe that the sword rose 
out of the sea and returned to its shrine through supernatural means.
Whatever the fate of the original or subsequently rendered versions of the 
Sacred Treasures, they have retained their symbolic power. It is forbidden 
for the public to see them; thus, their existence cannot be proven. They 
are revealed only to the emperor and selected priests. Popular belief holds 
that they are safeguarded in separate shrines: Ise Grand Shrine in the Mie 
Prefecture holds the mirror, Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya holds the sword (or its 
replica), and the Three Palace Sanctuaries in Tokyo keep the jewel.

Lost and Found: Preserving 
and Restoring Art
A
s you will see in this lecture, technology today is such that in many 
cases, a new version of what has otherwise irreparably been lost can 
be created. Art history has always been an inexact science, and there 
is an element of mysticism behind the theories of some of the most 
prominent art historians. However, many protagonists in the field of digital 
art history come from scientific backgrounds and have applied advanced 
technology to art historical puzzles and mysteries. They have made progress 
where hundreds of more traditional researchers have failed because they have 
stepped outside of the box and approached problems from new angles.

Lecture 12 | Lost and Found: Preserving and Restoring Art
The Impact of Digital Photography
Since the late ’90s, in the era of inexpensive, high-quality digital photography 
and universal access to images via the internet, the most dramatic 
breakthroughs have come through forensics. For example, digital photography 
has had an enormous impact on helping to preserve and share art as well 
as analyze it. For instance, on April 25, 2015, the Caverne du Pont d’Arc, 
a precise, full-size replica of the Chauvet cave, which contains the world’s 
oldest paintings, opened to the public in the Ardèche region of France. 
Having employed powerful cameras to effectively scan every contour of the 
original cave and then reproduce it, this replica allows visitors to admire 
a high-tech recreation of an original work that cannot be viewed in person.
High-quality digital images are also a portal to the discovery of details that 
are not easily visible to the human eye. Ultra-high-quality digital photographs, 
and the ease of producing and disseminating other methods of digital imaging, 
have promoted the study of art and facilitated breakthroughs that had never 
been noted by even the most meticulous art historians examining with the 
naked eye or magnifying glasses. Many digital explorations begin with simple, 
naked-eye detective work. Something about a painting “doesn’t look right,” 
which prompts an art historian to investigate further. When Caravaggio 
expert Roberto Longhi glimpsed a shadowy painting, caked with grime, 
hanging in a dark corner of a Jesuit seminary in Dublin, he thought that it 
might be a decent 17th-century copy of Caravaggio’s famous, lost Taking of 
Christ, perhaps by one of the Dutch Caravaggisti. He arranged for it to be 
restored and, upon viewing the cleaned painting in proper light, had that 
eureka moment of which all scholars dream, seeing that he had found the lost 
Caravaggio original.
Multispectral photography, using light beyond the visible spectrum, 
has been an incredible tool in the hands of art detectives. With infrared 
reflectography, beams of infrared light pass through paint but bounce off of 
any underdrawings that remain invisible beneath, allowing you to see beneath 
layers of paint. Ultraviolet light is particularly helpful in illuminating layers of 
different ages on a painting, allowing conservators to better see overpainting 
or substances that may have been layered over the painting with time. X-ray 
imaging can be incredibly useful in isolating specific properties of a painting, 
such as where a certain pigment was used.

86
Lecture 12 | Lost and Found: Preserving and Restoring Art
In 2012, these new methods prompted an amazing discovery at Madrid’s 
Museo del Prado. The museum was in possession of what appeared to be 
a so-so 17th-century copy of Leonardo’s Mona Lisa. However, it had an odd 
background that looked, upon closer inspection, to be an overpainting. An 
investigation with infrared reflectography revealed that there was indeed 
a painting beneath the blacked-over background. Cleaning off the top black 
layer, conservators were amazed to find a delicate painted background, nearly 
identical to the background of the original Mona Lisa painting. In the Louvre 
original, Lisa Gherardini, or “Mona Lisa,” appears quite a bit older than she 
was at the time her portrait was done—possibly due to the varnish, which 
makes her skin appear middle-aged. However, in the Prado version, she looks 
fresher, in her early twenties, which was her actual age at the time. She also 
has eyebrows, which do not appear in the Louvre original because they simply 
faded over time.

Advanced Imaging
A painting that shows off the evolution 
of restoration techniques beautifully is 
Raphael’s famous Portrait of a Lady with 
a Unicorn portrait. It’s only been known 
as this since the 1930s. Prior to that, it 
was thought to be merely an unattributed 
portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria 
because at some point at least a few hundred 
years ago, the composition was painted over 
with a Catherine wheel—a hagiographic 
symbol associated with the saint.
Roberto Longhi had a legendary reputation 
for correctly identifying unattributed works. 
He believed from his close viewing of the Saint Catherine 
portrait that it was, in fact, a Raphael that had been 
heavily modified. He was right, and a painstaking two-
year restoration to remove the overpainting revealed 
Portrait of a Lady with a Unicorn. However, in 1959, 
using early X-ray imaging, scientists revealed that the 
restoration might not have gone far enough. Underneath 
the unicorn, a small lapdog was revealed, the ears of which you can make out 
as pentimenti on the sleeves of the lady’s dress. Thus, it was originally a lady 
with a lapdog—or perhaps not. Further modern imaging techniques and scans 
have cast doubt on whether Raphael painted this dog either. Art historian 
Hasan Niyazi theorized that the lapdog was added by another hand prior to its 
transformation into a unicorn by still another painter.
Imaging continues to get better, and new discoveries are being made all the 
time. In 2022, the National Gallery of Scotland x-rayed Head of a Peasant 
Woman, an 1885 work by Vincent van Gogh. The X-rays revealed a surprise: 
On the back of the canvas, there was another painting, which appears to 
be a self-portrait of van Gogh himself. His first known self-portrait did not 
appear until 1886, making this ghostly image the earliest yet found. The 
image is not visible from the back because, at some point, van Gogh reinforced 
the canvas by gluing a cardboard backing to it, covering up the self-portrait.

88
Lecture 12 | Lost and Found: Preserving and Restoring Art
High-tech methods are also increasingly being used to authenticate paintings 
that have been circulating for some time but for which connoisseurship 
and provenance have been unable to establish authenticity. In some cases, 
multispectral analysis can even turn up the provenance itself. A painting 
known as Rejected from 1883 was thought by its buyers to be by the 
Australian impressionist Tom Roberts. However, experts could not agree on 
its authenticity. Infrared examination provided an unusual definitive clue: 
Tom Roberts’s name was hidden on the back, as was a London address that 
investigation confirmed was where the artist had lived while he was a young 
student at the Royal Academy of Arts. The lead allowed investigators to track 
down sketchbooks from the right period, which additionally contained what 
appeared to be studies for the work.
Miscellaneous Applications
A Dutch conservator and his team have come up with a way to examine art 
at such a microscopic level that the method has a good chance of eliminating 
forgery altogether. Dr. Bill Wei is the man behind so-called art fingerprinting. 
The principle is to use a high-powered zoom lens camera that functions like 
a microscope to take an extreme close-up of a portion of an artwork or other 
object, as small as one square millimeter. Software then maps the topography 
of that square millimeter, turning the photograph into what looks like a heart 
rate monitor, showing the peaks and crevices in the surfaces of even smooth 
objects. The idea is that only the owner of an artwork will know the location 
of the square millimeter thus “fingerprinted.” As such, this is a way to identify 
a work as your own by matching the topography of the fingerprinted portion 
of the object in question with the fingerprint photograph that you keep on 
file. No forgery technique is sufficiently detailed to reproduce the microscopic 
topography of an individual millimeter of surface area.
Perhaps the most sensational recovery of a lost masterpiece in recent years is that 
of Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi. It depicts Christ in blue Renaissance 
garb and holding a crystal ball. It was likely done as a work for private devotion. 
However, the provenance trail is weak and unclear after 1530, and a consensus 
emerged that the painting had been destroyed or lost, perhaps around 1600. 
This might have consigned it to obscurity were it not for the sheer number of 
copies that are circulating. At least 30 by various pupils and followers have been 
identified—a clear demonstration that the painting was highly regarded during

Lecture 12 | Lost and Found: Preserving and Restoring Art
the artist’s life and that there was an 
original from which they could copy. 
Some art historians have posited that 
perhaps one of these copies is, in fact, 
the original.
High-tech methods can also create 
what might have been but never 
was. The Next Rembrandt project 
is a high-tech collaboration to create 
a digitally printed painting in the style 
of Rembrandt. The portrait’s face is 
fictional, based on a facial recognition 
algorithm and computer hybridization 
of real Rembrandt subjects. The 
result was unveiled in Amsterdam in 
April 2016. With AI art applications 
available on phones and over browsers, 
this kind of technology is just starting 
to reach the public.

Lecture 12 | Lost and Found: Preserving and Restoring Art
This act of creating imaginary artwork could also easily be applied to works 
that are lost. For instance, in 2017, Iranian American artist Morehshin 
Allahyari exhibited 12 3D-printed artifacts destroyed by ISIS, including 
a Roman-period statue of King Uthal of Hatra, in a show called She Who Sees 
the Unknown. The previous year, a 3D-printed, two-thirds-scale replica of the 
Arch of Triumph at Palmyra, also destroyed by ISIS, was raised in London’s 
Trafalgar Square before traveling to cities around the world.
