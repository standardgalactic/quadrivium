Dedication
Nothing refl ects the passing of time more than growth and changes in our 
children. It seems like just yesterday that Joan and I received the call that 
changed our lives as we exited my 96-year-old grandmother’s funeral. The 
call was from our pastor’s wife, Linda Johnson. She said a baby boy had been 
born that morning in Hood River, Oregon, and asked if we wanted him. The 
next day, Joan and I walked out of the Hood River Memorial Hospital with our 
son, Wesley.
In the last six years since that moment, the time has passed like a blink of an 
eye. We have added another blessing in Annabelle, who also has a divine and 
miraculous story. In those years, which seem like mere moments in time, it 
seems like seconds ago we got our fi rst smile, giggle, crawl, and walk out of 
each of them. We had joyous celebrating recently when we realized we had 
changed our last diaper for probably the next 20 years!
I dedicate this book to my two precious time clocks of life, Annabelle and 
Wesley. The time with you two moves too quickly. I, as all parents, fi ght to 
stay in the moment, enjoy every moment, and relive those moments before 
they are gone. You two have taught me more about time’s value, joy, and its 
ever-marching-on characteristics than anyone else in my years on Earth. I 
love you both deeply and praise God for the honor he bestowed on me to be 
your dad.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I always have to thank my team at Sales Champions and Real Estate 
Champions. It is truly an honor to be surrounded by so many talented 
people. I must especially thank my Senior Management Team; Don 
Cunningham, the President of both companies; and Julie Porfi rio, Senior 
Vice President of Operations. You both have worked hard to insulate me so I 
could take on another For Dummies book.
To Jody McBride, my Assistant, who labored over my handwritten words to 
type, organize, revise, and edit the whole manuscript — thanks. This book 
would not have existed without your fi ne work.
To Tracy Boggier, my Acquisitions Editor at Wiley; Kristin DeMint, Project 
Editor; and Erin Calligan Mooney, Editorial Program Coordinator, who 
stepped in to help lend a hand.
To Betsy Sheldon, who did another masterful job of taking my writing and 
morphing it into the wonderful For Dummies format.
To my wife, Joan, my son, Wesley, and my daughter, Annabelle. Thank you 
for your patience and grace. There is a sacrifi ce of time that we all make 
when I am writing a book!

Introduction
T
ime is the only resource that people can’t borrow, buy, or barter. And 
time refuses to follow one of the main tenets of the law of supply and 
demand: the idea that when the demand goes up to a high level, the supply 
will increase to meet the demand. People may use different amounts of time 
to accomplish results, but everyone is endowed with the same amount of 
time each day: 86,400 seconds.
Your ability to manage that time is really one of the top two causes of suc-
cess or failure in your life. Investing greater amounts of time into a need, goal, 
objective, or even weakness can tip the balance of success in your favor. At 
numerous crossroads in life, I had to be willing to apply more time than my 
competitors to achieve a competitive advantage over them in the market-
place. I certainly didn’t take for granted that my mental power was far supe-
rior to that of my competitors. Rather, my willingness to invest more time in 
certain tasks or use my time more effectively equalized the playing field.
Of course, if you invest too much time at work, you can be a success at the 
office but a failure at home. A true champion always has his or her pulse on 
home life and invests the right amount to keep vital relationships in life grow-
ing and thriving. The good news is that this book has both arenas covered. 
Congratulations on investing in yourself, your success, and your life!
About This Book
Successful Time Management For Dummies is about using your time more 
effectively to create greater results at the office and at home. It helps you 
with your organizational habits, discipline, systemization, goals, values, man-
agement style, persuasion, and even travel. This isn’t just a book of theory; 
rather, it’s one of real techniques, strategies, and tools that I’ve personally 
used, taught, coached, and spoke about. I’ve seen them bring forth a bounty 
of results in my life as well as in the lives of countless others.
Here, I help you mentally wrap your brain around the problems of time man-
agement. Then I explain how to establish a solid system that you can repli-
cate over time. I introduce you to prioritization systems, time-categorization 
systems, time-blocking strategies, and appointment-setting strategies.
Note that in the spirit of saving you time, this is also a reference book. In 
other words, you don’t have to read it from cover to cover. Just look up what 
you need and put those ideas in action.

Successful Time Management For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book as easy to use as possible, I use the following conventions 
throughout:
 
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
 Some Web addresses may break across two lines of text. In such cases, 
I didn’t insert any hyphens to indicate the break, so if you type exactly 
what you see — pretending the line break doesn’t exist — you’ll get to 
your Web destination.
 
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
 Bold is used to highlight keywords in bulleted lists or to identify the 
action parts of numbered lists.
 
 I indent and italicize dialogues throughout the book. You can use 
them verbatim or with minor tweaks to increase your success in time 
management.
What You’re Not to Read
Personally, I think you should read every word of this book. I wrote it, after 
all! However, if you’re the bare-bones-info type, you can skip the sidebars 
that appear throughout the book. Those gray boxes contain interesting, 
often anecdotal information that’s related to the topic but not essential to 
understanding it.
Foolish Assumptions
When I wrote the book, I assumed a few things about you, my dear reader:
 
 You want to use your time better. You expect to gain more time with 
your loved ones, you want to ramp up your success at work, or you’re 
looking for a little of both.
 
 You know that effective time management isn’t a one-stop fix; it’s a com-
prehensive effort that requires looking at all time-draining culprits. You’re 
willing to invest the effort needed to develop your time-management skills 
(or create them if they don’t currently exist!).
 
 You’re willing to be patient with yourself throughout the difficult pro-
cess of self-betterment, knowing that in the end, all your efforts will be 
worth your while.

  Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
I divided this book into six major parts to help you find what you need as 
quickly as possible. The content is organized so you can choose to read only 
the topics that interest you or the entire part. Here’s what you can find.
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: 
Simple Steps to Start With
Part I presents an overview of the most important matters to master in order 
to succeed in managing your time effectively. I begin by helping you grab 
back control in Chapter 1 and then help you establish and align your goals 
with your time in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, I help you understand the value of 
your time down to the minute.
Part II: Establishing a Good System
Anyone who is effective in time management has created a personalized 
time-management system. Even though the system is customized, it needs to 
follow many of the strategies and principles I present in this part. Chapter 4 
delves into prioritization strategies and tools, taking you deep into the most 
important characteristics of a great time manager. It also tells you how to 
time-block your way to greater success. In Chapter 5, I show you how to 
overcome the organizational challenges in your workspace and desktop while 
also taking the confusion out of technological organization in Chapter 6. I 
close out this part with Chapter 7, which presents ways to save your 
time and lower your frustration about being on the road — all from an expert 
traveler’s perspective.
Part III: Confronting Challenges 
to Time Management
No matter your time-management skill or strategy, challenges will always 
appear regularly, trying to throw you off track. I anticipate these challenges 
and share how to convey your message with power, precision, clarity, and 
brevity in Chapter 8. In Chapter 9, I attack the elephant in the room for most 
people: the interruptions during the course of the day. I gently coach you on 
lowering your level of procrastination in Chapter 10 so you can be positive 
about yourself, your skills, and your results. In Chapter 11, I guide you in how 
to make wiser, better, and faster decisions so you move yourself off the fence 
of indecision.

Successful Time Management For Dummies 
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency 
When Working with Others
No one works in a vacuum; everyone relies on others to help, administrate, 
serve, sell, manage, guide, and lead. In Chapter 12, I help you deal with a most 
frustrating woe: managing your time when you work for a supervisor who 
makes doing so difficult. Most people have experienced numerous times of 
death-by-meeting in their business careers, so in Chapter 13, I help you craft 
rules and a process to avoid that dead end. I close out this part with Chapter 
14, which provides the skills to qualify prospects, prepare appointments, and 
compel your customers to act without delay.
Part V: Advanced Time Management 
for Specific Folks
This part contains the tips for you to take your business and career to the 
highest level no matter your job title. I kick off this section with Chapter 15, 
on increasing the performance of support staff through time management. 
I next work with my favorite group of people — salespeople — to increase 
their sales through time-management techniques designed for them in 
Chapter 16. In Chapter 17, I coach owners and executives to squeeze more 
time out of their already overcommitted days. Finally, I close out this part 
with management strategies, tactics, and coaching and teaching systems and 
tools so you can pass on your new knowledge to others.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book ends with the famous Part of Tens. In this one, 
you get five tip-packed chapters on time-wasting behaviors, time-efficiency 
habits, time-savers for your personal life, fine-tuning your focus, and my 
personal favorite: time-saving technologies.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book a bit better, you can rely on the icons in the 
book’s margins. The icons act as little signposts pointing out the important info.
 
This bull’s-eye icon points out little-advertised nuggets of knowledge that are 
certain to give you an edge in increasing your time-management skills.

5
  Introduction
 
This icon denotes critical information that you really need to take away with 
you. Remember these points, if nothing else. They address the issues that you 
come across repeatedly with time management.
 
Consider this the flashing red light on the road to making a sale. When you see 
the Warning icon, you know to steer clear of whatever practice, behavior, or 
response I indicate.
 
These icons tell you that I’ve cracked open the archives of my life experiences 
or my successful clients’ life experiences to help illustrate a point.
Where to Go From Here
In this book, I use the classic For Dummies fashion: You have easy access to 
the precise information you need when you need it. You can start at page one 
and read through or hop around, targeting the areas you need the most help 
with first. Keep this book close by to help you wring the most you can out of 
life in the scant 24 hours you have each day.
Part I is a good place to start because it helps you deal with the mental barriers 
to time management that can seem to form an unscalable wall. After that, you 
may want to pick topics that cause you the most challenge or frustration. For 
instance, you can check out Chapter 11 for ways to beat procrastination or see 
Chapter 13 so you can get a handle on upcoming meetings. On the other hand, 
if you feel you have your time strategy pretty much under control but are look-
ing for a tune up, you may go right to Part V first. There, I address how to take 
time management to the highest level through customized plans for your job 
or job title.
The truth is that no matter where you take your first plunge, the water’s fine. 
You can find plenty of valuable information that you can use to increase your 
performance without increasing your hours at work.

Successful Time Management For Dummies 

Part I
Beginning the 
Revolution: Simple 
Steps to Start With

In this part . . .
S
eems like everyone’s had some version of the dream 
in which you’re trying to move toward something, 
yet each step is a monumental effort. You feel as if you’re 
running in water, your legs weighted like lead. It doesn’t 
take a Freudian analyst to figure that one out: You feel that 
you’re not achieving your ambitions, not because of some 
external barrier, but because you’re tripping yourself up.
You can look to yourself for the reasons behind your time 
management successes as well. And that’s great news. 
In Chapter 1, you assess where you stand in terms of 
time management, discover the importance of setting up 
a system, and get started with some basic guidelines. 
Chapter 2 walks you through the process of pinpointing 
your goals and connecting them to your time management 
efforts. And in Chapter 3, I support a fundamental truth — 
time is money — and explain how you can calculate the 
value of your time.

Chapter 1
Setting Yourself Up for Success
In This Chapter
 Tapping into your time-management strengths
 Building a solid system of time management
 Facing up to time management’s biggest challenges
 Addressing issues with others
 Applying time-management skills to all facets of your life
T
ime is the great equalizer — everyone has the same amount in a day. 
No matter who you are, where you live, and what you do, you clock the 
same 24-hour cycle as the next person. One person may be wealthier than 
another, but that doesn’t earn him a minute more than the poorest people on 
the planet.
If that simple fact seems a bit discouraging, think of it this way: You may 
not have the power to get yourself more time, but you do have the power to 
make the most of it. You can take your 365 days a year, seven days a week, 
and 1,440 minutes in a day and invest them in such a way that you reap a 
return that fulfills your life and attracts the success you dream of.
That’s what this book is about: taking control of how you spend your time to 
make sure you’re using it how you really want to. You really are in control of 
your time, even though you don’t always feel like it — even if you have a job 
that demands overtime; even if you have kids who keep you in the carpool 
loop; even if you have dreams and goals that involve developing new skills or 
furthering your education.
All in all, discovering how to manage your time well is part mental restructur-
ing and part creating a system. Effective time management requires a little 
introspection, some good habits and organizational skills, and more than a 
few logistical and tactical tools. But all are achievable, and all are covered 
in this book. So if you have the time — and I assure you that you do — get 
ready for a journey that’s certain to, if not buy you more time, show you how 
to make the absolute most of the 24 hours in your day.

Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Getting to Know Yourself
Although everyone gets the same number of hours to work with each day, 
what people don’t have in equal amounts are other valuable assets: skill, 
intelligence, money, ambition, energy, passion, attitude, even looks. All these 
unique reserves play into your best use of time. So the better you understand 
yourself — your strengths, weaknesses, goals, values, and motivations — the 
easier it is to manage your time effectively. In this section, you look at your 
strengths and goals, think about how much your time is worth, and observe per-
sonal energy and behavior patterns that affect your focus throughout the day.
Assessing your strengths and weaknesses
 
As a young man, I thought I was good — okay, I admit it; I thought I was 
great — at a much larger group of skills, tasks, and jobs than I do today. In 
fact, the older I get, the more I realize the list of what I’m not good at dwarfs 
the lists of things I am good at. Being consciously competent at those few, 
however, gets me a lot further than being unconsciously incompetent, as 
I once was. Despite my poor academic record in high school, as a young 
adult, I was a quick study at what I needed to do to be as successful in life 
as I wanted to be. At some point, I saw the light and realized I needed to 
face up to what I had to do to get where I wanted to go.
First, I took stock of my assets: I tallied up my strengths, skills, and even my 
weaknesses. And I identified things I needed to work on and things I needed to 
leverage. That’s when I realized that although some people were smarter, were 
more educated, had more money, and knew more influential people than I did, 
I had the same amount of time as anyone else. And if I wanted to get ahead, it 
was up to me to harness my time and invest it in such a way to get a greater 
return. My willingness to invest more time to gain the edge helped equalize the 
playing field for me and help me achieve the success I enjoy today.
Chances are that by this point in your life, you’ve discovered some skills that 
you come to naturally or perhaps have worked hard to acquire. Maybe you’re 
a master negotiator. Or a whiz with numbers. You may be a good writer. Or 
you may have a silver tongue. Whatever your strengths, developing the hand-
ful that brings you the most return on your efforts, propelling you forward 
to attain your goals, is a more productive course of action than trying to be 
the best at everything. For most people, these strengths typically number no 
more than a half-dozen. 
In addition to pinpointing your strengths, you need to identify the areas 
where your skills are lackluster. Then figure out which tasks are essential for 
meeting the goals you want to accomplish, and build those skills. Invest time 
in honing and maintaining your strengths, and improve the weaknesses that 
you need to overcome to reach your goals. Remember: To be successful, you 
need to be selective.

11
 Chapter 1: Setting Yourself Up for Success
Naming goals to give you direction
You know how it is: When you’re working toward something, keeping your 
focus is much easier. A woman may want to lose weight, for example, but per-
haps she struggles to stick to a diet or exercise plan. But if her son’s wedding 
is looming three months away on her calendar, she may be more inspired to 
stay on track, cutting back on second helpings and getting in workouts.
 
Your goals can serve as inspiration in adopting good time-management skills. 
After all, managing your time isn’t really a benefit in and of itself, but manag-
ing your time so you can spend more of it doing what’s important to you is — 
whether you’re saving for a retirement of travel and adventure or buying the 
house in the perfect neighborhood.
Using your aspirations to fire up your time management success means you 
have to identify your goals and keep them in the front of your mind. Pinning 
down what’s most important to you may require some soul searching. Write 
down your goals — all of them — and follow these guidelines:
 
 Cast a wide net. Go for the big goals, such as joining the Peace Corps, as 
well as the not-so-big ones, such as getting an energy-efficient car next 
year.
 
 Think big. Don’t rein in your dreams because they seem unrealistic.
 
 Be as descriptive as possible. Instead of “build my dream house,” flesh 
it out: Where is this house? How big? What features does it have? What 
does it look like? When do you want to move in?
 
 Don’t limit goals to a single category. Think about goals for your career, 
your personal life, your social situation, your financial status, and any 
other facet of life that’s important to you.
Throwing money away
I once saw a woman in a parking lot throw pen-
nies on the ground. When I asked her what she 
was doing, she told me she’d just read about a 
multimillionaire who had calculated his worth, 
and based on the value of an hour of his time, 
he determined that it wasn’t worth the few sec-
onds it’d take for him to pick up a dollar bill from 
the sidewalk. She, however, had decided that 
although it was worth her time to pick up a dollar, 
she could afford to part with a few pennies.
I think she missed the point, but there’s a lesson 
in this experience: You’re always on the clock. 
Time is money, and yours has a value. Giving 
away your precious time without a sense of its 
value is like throwing money on the sidewalk. By 
knowing what your time is worth, you can pri-
oritize those tasks that yield the greatest return, 
delegating or eliminating those tasks that pro-
vide little to no return on your time investment.

12
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
The process of goal-seeking can be a fun and energizing experience, and it’s 
one you can explore at length in Chapter 2. You also see how your current 
time use can affect the forecast for your future.
Assigning your time a monetary 
worth to guide your priorities
Most people think about the value of their time as it relates to on-the-job 
activity. The fast-food worker knows he earns a minimum wage per hour. The 
freelance artist advertises a per-hour rate. The massage therapist charges 
for her services in half-hour and hour increments. But to be truly aware of 
the value of your time, you need to carry this concept into your personal life 
as well. The value of time in your personal life is at least as valuable as your 
work life time. In some cases, personal time is priceless.
 
One of the most important points to remember as you work through this book 
is that it’s okay not to get everything done. What’s critical is making sure that 
the important things are getting done. By assigning value to your time and using 
the skills you acquire from this book, you can clearly identify what’s important 
and make conscious, wise choices. For example, if you need to save another 
$200 per month because you want to start an account for your children’s col-
lege education, you may determine that putting in an extra shift at work may 
not be worth the loss of time with your family, even at time-and-a-half pay. Or 
if you really detest yard work, then paying someone else $50 to cut your grass 
may be a fair trade for the extra two hours of time watching the game.
Breakout! Sharpening your focus with time off
About ten years ago, as I was evaluating my 
sales results, I puzzled over a drop in my num-
bers at the ninth week when I’d been working 
without a break. It didn’t take me long to real-
ize that my lower results reflected my drop in 
focus. And it’s a pattern I could see in previous 
months. I realized the best course of action, 
rather than gutting it out, was to get out. I 
needed a vacation.
I also found that I didn’t need a full week’s vaca-
tion to return to work revitalized and refreshed. 
I simply needed a mini-break, about four days 
over the course of a long weekend to step away 
from the work routine and see the world through 
another lens, whether holing up with my family 
or making an escape to the beach.
To this day, I lay out my whole year in advance, 
based on this rhythm. As I’ve aged, I see the 
need for a break every eight weeks, and as I 
approach the next decade of my career, I antic-
ipate it shrinking to seven weeks. The recharge 
number is still four days.

13
 Chapter 1: Setting Yourself Up for Success
In Chapter 3, I help you calculate what an hour of your time is worth — 
regardless of whether you’re on the clock at work — so you can figure out 
where to invest the most time. And in Chapter 4, I introduce you to the universal 
truth that 20 percent of your efforts produce 80 percent of the results. So after 
you uncover which efforts produce that return, you can crank up those efforts 
to increase your results. Most success comes from prioritizing activities that 
produce results and giving them the focus they warrant, so anything you can 
do to increase your powers of concentration serves you well.
Identifying your rhythm to get in the zone
Athletes talk about being in the zone, a place where positive results seem to 
stick like a magnet. Well, I’m here to tell you that the zone isn’t some magical 
place where wishes come true. Anybody can get there, without a lucky token 
or fairy dust. What it takes is focus, singular focus.
 
As an ex-professional athlete in racquetball in the 1980s, I can say I’ve been 
in the zone a number of times. And I’ve experienced that same distillation of 
focus and electric energy on work projects as well — times when my volume 
and quality of work was bordering on unbelievable. If you can get your focus 
under control, you can visit the zone every day and make great things happen.
If you know your rhythms — when you’re most on, what times of day you’re 
best equipped to undertake certain tasks — you can perform your most 
important activities when you’re in the zone. Everyone works to a unique 
pace, and recognizing that rhythm is one of the most valuable personal 
discoveries you can make. Some of the aspects you need to explore include 
the following:
 
 How many hours can you work at a high level each day?
 
 What’s your most productive time of the day?
 
 How many weeks can you work at high intensity without a break?
 
 How long of a break do you need so you can come back focused 
and intense?
Chapter 25 offers advice on attaining focus, including ten easy-to-adopt 
habits that nurture success.
Following a System
Effective time management requires more than good intent and self-
knowledge. To keep your time under careful control, you need a frame-
work. In your arsenal of time-management ammunition, you want to stock 

14
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
organizational skills, technology that helps keep you on track, and plan-
ning tools that help you keep the reins on your time, hour by hour, day by 
day, week by week, and so forth.
Establishing a solid system you can replicate is a key to succeeding in man-
aging your time. Systems, standards, strategies, and rules protect your time 
and allow you to use it to your best advantage. These skills are applicable 
whether you’re the company CEO, a salesperson, a midlevel manager, an 
executive, or an administrative assistant. No matter your work or your work 
environment, time management is of universal value. (Visit Part V for chap-
ters that spell out particulars for your job situation.)
Scheduling your time and 
creating a routine
Sticking to a time-scheduling system can’t guarantee the return of your long-
lost vacation days, but by regularly tracking your meetings, appointments, 
and obligations, you reduce your odds of double-booking and scheduling 
appointments too close. And by planning ahead, you make sure to make time 
for all the important things first.
For years, I’ve followed the time-blocking system, which I detail in Chapter 4. 
The system ensures that you put your priorities first (starting with routines 
and then moving to individual tasks/activities) before scheduling in commit-
ments and activities of lesser importance.
Such time-management techniques are just as applicable to the other spheres 
of your life. There’s a reason why I advise you to plug in your personal com-
mitments first when filling in your time-blocking schedule: Your personal 
time is worthy of protection, and you can further enhance that time by apply-
ing time-management principles.
Organizing your surroundings
A good system of time management requires order and organization. Creating 
order in your world saves time wasted searching for stuff, from important 
phone numbers to your shoes. But even more, physical order creates mental 
order and helps you perform more efficiently.
Yes, your workspace should be clean and orderly, with papers and folders 
arranged in some sort of sequence that makes items easy and quick to find. 
Your desk should be cleared off, providing space to work. Your important 
tools — phone, computer, calculator — ought to be within reach. And your 

15
 Chapter 1: Setting Yourself Up for Success
day planner, of course, should be at your fingertips. Your briefcase, your 
meeting planner, even your closet has an impact on your time management 
success. (For more on keeping your office in order, read Chapter 5.)
Using time-saving technology
Organization extends beyond your work area: Not only should your com-
puter be nearby, but the files, documents, and contact information on that 
computer should be ordered for quick access. The computer stores your 
address list, tracks your correspondence, and contains your calendar and 
upcoming appointments.
But that’s just the beginning. Today’s teleconferencing and videoconferenc-
ing equipment means you can hold weekly meetings with your colleagues 
who live on the other side of the globe without anyone having to turn in a 
travel expense report. Cellphones and PDAs mean you can conduct business 
on the road without having to pull off to find a phone booth.
The schedule will set you free
Too many people feel that all this structure is 
too restrictive. They think the freedom they seek 
with their schedules and their lives is contained 
in a more flexible environment. They’re afraid 
establishing a routine will keep them wrapped 
in the chains of time.
However, most people waste too much time 
figuring out each individual day on the fly. They 
react to the day rather than respond. Reacting 
is a reflex action that turns over your agenda to 
others, and that can’t possibly lead to freedom. 
Responding is a disciplined act of planning that 
determines where and how you’ll invest your 
time.
For example, suppose you have a set place in 
your schedule to respond to phone calls and 
problems. You’ve established the routine of 
dealing with these issues in predetermined time 
slots. You can hold off on your response until 
later — when you’re calmer, more focused, 
and in a problem-solving mentality — instead 
of reacting because you’re dealing with the 
issue now.
Planning how to spend your time, which at 
first glance seems opposed to freedom, is the 
only pathway to the true mastery of time. With 
the right routine come simplicity, productivity, 
and freedom. The “what am I going to work on 
today?” or “what’s my schedule today?” never 
happens. And when you get the important work 
out of the way, you free yourself to do what you 
really enjoy.
If you’re a free spirit and what I’m suggesting 
just fried your circuits, start with a small amount 
of routine. Ask yourself, “Can I establish a 
daily routine to try it out? What can I do with-
out having it send me into withdrawal?” Then 
implement a new routine every week. You’ll add 
more than 50 new pieces of structure to your 
schedule in a normal work year and see a sig-
nificant improvement in your freedom.

In fact, technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that it’s a struggle to 
keep up with all the advances. In Chapter 6, I present an overview of the 
many technologies at your disposal to help you make the best use of your 
time. And Chapter 24 names some of my favorite time-saving devices.
Overcoming Time-Management Obstacles
Anyone can conquer time management, but it’s not always easy. If your 
experience is anything like mine, sometimes your days feel like a video game, 
where you’re in constant threat of being gobbled up on your course to the 
finish line. But instead of cartoon threats, your obstacles are your own short-
comings (poor communication skills, procrastination, and the inability to 
make wise and quick decisions), time-wasting co-workers and bosses, phone 
and people interruptions, and unproductive meetings.
Communicating effectively
Communicating effectively is one of the best ways to maximize your time. 
One of the biggest time-wasters on company time is, no surprise, talking 
with co-workers. But what may be a surprise is that the abuse isn’t a func-
tion of weekend catch-up discussions that take place at the water cooler or 
the gossip circle at the copy machine. Rather, it’s the banter at the weekly 
staff status reports, the drawn-out updates of projects that never seem to 
conclude, the sales presentations that get off-track. It’s all the meetings that 
could be as brief as 10 minutes but somehow take an hour or more.
At your disposal, however, is an amazing weapon for taming these misbehav-
ing encounters: your words. With a few deft remarks, you have the power to 
bring these meetings to a productive close.
In Chapter 10, I provide specific insight on which types of situations are most 
appropriate for each of the primary communication methods — face-to-face, 
verbal only, and written — and I present plenty of ideas for communicating 
your message and posing questions strategically, succinctly, and successfully 
so your communication ends in results, action, and decisions — whether 
you’re leading a meeting or simply attending it.
Circumventing interruptions
Interruptions creep into your workday in all sorts of insidious manners. 
Besides the pesky co-worker stepping into your office with “Got a sec?” 
interruptions come in the form of unproductive meetings, phone calls, hall 

17
 Chapter 1: Setting Yourself Up for Success
conversations that drift into your office and distract you, even the “you’ve 
got mail” icon that creeps onto the lower corner of your computer monitor.
Additionally, most poor time managers interrupt themselves by trying to do 
too much at once. Study after study supports that multitasking isn’t the most 
effective work style. The constant stops and starts disrupt a project, requir-
ing startup time each time you turn back to the task.
I explore a number of these interruptions in Chapter 11, and I offer plenty of 
advice on preempting such disruptions, as well as cutting them short so you 
can get your train of thought back on the track.
Getting procrastination under control
Sometimes, it’s tempting to use interruptions as an excuse to postpone a 
project or a task. How nice to have someone else to blame for not getting 
started! And before you know it, you’ve found so many good reasons not to 
do something that you’ve backed yourself into a really tight eleventh-hour 
corner, and the pressure’s on.
Say you’re writing a 400-page book and you have 10 months to complete the 
project. You have almost a year to put this thing together. Looking forward, 
your task requires you to complete 40 pages per month — little more than a 
page a day. That’s too easy! You can afford to put it off for a while. Wait for 
a couple of months, and then you’ll need to produce 50 pages a month. Still 
doable. But at some point, doable starts to morph into impossible. But when? 
When you’re down to four months and pressured to crank out 100 pages per 
month? Or do you wait until the last minute and find yourself struggling to 
complete nearly 15 pages per day?
Procrastination has a lot of causes, but most of the reasons to procrastinate 
leave you headed for trouble. Chapter 12 addresses the perils of putting 
things off and offers secrets to overcoming that all-too-human tendency to 
postpone until tomorrow what you could’ve done today.
Making decisions: Just do it
One of the easiest things to put off is making a decision. Even sidestepping 
the smallest decisions can lead to giant time-consumption. Think about it: 
You scroll through your e-mail and save one to ponder and respond to later. 
You revisit a few times and still can’t bring yourself to a commitment. So you 
get more e-mail from the sender. To stave off making a decision, you ask a 
couple of questions, which requires more time and attention. By the time 
the issue is resolved and put to bed, you may have invested five times more 
attention than if you’d handled it at once.

18
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Many factors create the confusion and uncertainty that prevents you from 
making sound but quick decisions. Often, part of the struggle is having too 
many options. Most people have a tough enough time choosing between 
pumpkin and apple pie at the Thanksgiving table. But every day, you’re 
forced to make decisions from choices as abundant as a home-style cafeteria 
line. Having options is usually a good thing, but too much choice is over-
whelming, even paralyzing.
In Chapter 13, I offer some advice to help you narrow your options for a 
quicker, right-on decision. I also reveal a little-known technique for success-
ful decision-making: using and blending your natural behavioral style with 
your decision-making system.
Garnering Support While Establishing 
Your Boundaries
Sometimes your family, friends, and co-workers are your biggest challenge to 
managing your time successfully. Whose phone calls interrupt your train of 
thought when you’re on a roll? Who expects you home for dinner, despite a 
pressing proposal deadline? For whose meetings do you have to take a break 
from your critical research?
Yet despite all the challenges they throw your way, these same folks can also 
serve as your allies as you pursue the quest of better time use. Getting them 
on board and perceiving them as comrades in shared goals is a great way to 
offset the interruptions that they also inevitably bring to the table.
Balancing work and time 
with family and friends
All work and no play, as they say, means something is askew with your life 
balance. Recognize that although your job and career are critical components 
of who you are, they’re also a means to support aspects of your life that, I 
suspect, are more important to you: your personal life, which includes your 
family, your friends, your community, and your leisure and social activities.
 
If you find yourself constantly putting in long hours at work for months on end, 
something’s off-kilter: Either you’re not managing your time effectively, or some-
thing’s wrong with your job. No one — not even Wall Street lawyers — should 
be putting in 70-hour weeks on a regular basis. A 70-hour work week leaves little 
time for sleep, recreation, family, or relationships.

19
 Chapter 1: Setting Yourself Up for Success
Still, getting the support of family members is critical for success. There’s no 
doubt that my family comes before my job, but that doesn’t mean I can drop 
work whenever I want. So my wife, Joan, and even my two children, six-year-old 
Wesley and two-year-old Annabelle, are my supporters, and we all work together 
to manage our time so we have more of it together.
See Chapter 5 for tips on managing your time when working in a home office 
and Chapter 3 for info on putting a value on personal time.
Streamlining interactions with 
co-workers and customers
Most people find themselves in a work environment in which they regularly 
interact with others, whether co-workers, business associations, or custom-
ers. The workday is rife with opportunities for interruption, distraction, and 
time-wasting. In addition to the phone calls and cubicle pop-ins, you have 
business appointments, associates who keep you waiting, or meetings that 
are unfocused and poorly run. 
Maintaining control of your time at work requires you to develop some ways 
to manage meetings, appointments, and other work interactions so they’re 
as efficient and productive as possible. In Chapters 15 and 16, I explore tac-
tics for planning, setting, leading, or just plain attending such gatherings. 
Whether you initiate the interaction or you’re merely a participant, you can 
have some control over the meeting.
Ah, but what if you’re in sales or a customer service capacity? In such posi-
tions, taking control of your time is a little more challenging. To make the 
sale, you want to take as much time as your prospect wants. And when 
addressing a service issue, your most important objective is to make the 
customer happy. But you can be successful in sales and serve your clients 
well and still keep control of your time. In fact, in Chapter 16, I show you how 
to speed up the decision-making process during sales so you get a positive 
answer sooner.
Keeping your boss on track
Trying to keep co-workers from impinging on your productive time is tick-
lish enough; things get even more sensitive when you have to tell your boss 
that you don’t have time to waste. But your supervisor is often the one who 
throws the most curveballs your way when it comes to using your time in the 
most productive way. How do you deal with the boss who waits to the last 
minute to drop a big project on your desk that needs to be done yesterday?

20
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
When trying to keep a rein on a time-wasting boss, you need to be prepared 
to summon up all your powers of diplomacy. You also need to be more direct 
from the outset. You may even have to suggest some of the time-management 
tips and tools from this chapter and others. I show you how to help your 
boss stay on track in Chapter 14.
Keeping Motivation High
According to Earl Nightingale, the dean of the personal development indus-
try, “Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or worthy ideal.” 
His definition doesn’t confine achievement to a fixed point but instead pres-
ents success as a journey. Like most goals, mastering your time-management 
skills isn’t something that happens overnight.
 
Throughout the process of working to improve the way you manage your time, 
you’ll occasionally encounter points where you start feeling disappointed, 
wondering whether your efforts are paying off. Whenever you hit those lows — 
and you will — remember to give yourself credit for every step you make in the 
right direction. One great way to stay motivated is to link incentive to induce-
ment: In other words, reward yourself. For example, if you complete certain 
actions that tie to your goals, give yourself Friday afternoon off. Or savor an 
evening on the couch with a good movie or dinner at a favorite restaurant. Do 
whatever serves as an enticing reward.
Take motivation to the next level by involving others in the reward. Let your 
spouse know that an evening out awaits if you fulfill your week’s goals before 
deadline. Tell the kids that if you spend the next couple of evenings at the 
office, you can all head for the amusement park on Saturday. I guarantee this 
strategy is a sure-fire way to supercharge your motivation.
As you work through this difficult but worthy bout of self-improvement, keep 
your mind on the positive side and remember two simple truths:
 
 You’re human.
 
 Work always expands to fill the time you allow for it.
No matter how productive I am, whether I have just a couple things to accom-
plish or a sky-high pile on my desk, and whether I leave work on time or stay 
late, there’s always something that doesn’t get done. So I don’t get hung up on 
those things I don’t accomplish — I just keep my eyes on the goal, prioritize 
accordingly, delegate what I can, and protect my boundaries carefully so I take 
on only as much as I know I can handle while still remaining satisfied with all 
parts of my life. When you start to get frustrated about the never-ending flow 
of work that comes your way, remind yourself that you’re blessed with more 
opportunities than time — and that’s not a bad place to be.

T
oday, more than at any time in history, you have limitless opportunities, 
especially if you’re living in the United States. However, having so many 
choices can lead to confusion, distraction, and wasted time. Achievement in 
anything in life takes focus, diligence, and patience. So the question arises: 
Can getting a handle on your most precious lifelong dreams and desires help 
you get more done on a day-to-day basis? Absolutely! Say, for example, you 
and your spouse have always dreamed of taking six months to travel the 
world while you’re still young enough to hoist a backpack. Such a focus may 
motivate you to put in extra hours or accelerate your sales quotas at work to 
build up the necessary funds and time for that adventure.
Even long-range goals can shape the way you use your time in the here 
and now. Suppose your goal is to retire to a modest cabin in the Smoky 
Mountains and spend the rest of your life writing the Great American Novel. 
Even if that goal is 30 years away, your priority now is more likely to be on 
investing your income and perhaps taking some writing courses rather than 
on building a 4,200-square-foot home and learning to ski — or it should be, 
anyway, because the preparations you need to make first and foremost are 
the ones that’ll enable you to build that cabin and have the money and time 
to write.
Everyone has dreams and goals for the future. But in order to accomplish 
more in less time, to create a sense of urgency and command efficiency, 
having a clear sense of goals and purpose is critical. In this chapter, I guide 

22
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
you in the process of committing your goals to paper; categorizing, balanc-
ing, and breaking them down into manageable chunks; and allowing that 
powerful action to spur your productivity.
Understanding Why You Need 
to Put Your Goals on Paper
Some studies calculate that only about 3 percent of goal-setters document 
their aspirations. And I can assure you that these folks are the ones who 
have the most money, influence, power, prestige, freedom, and time to work 
toward their dreams. Why? Because, as numerous studies suggest, people 
who clearly define and write down their goals are more likely to accomplish 
them — and in a shorter time frame and more direct fashion. People who 
don’t clarify and write out their goals invest more time and accomplish less.
When you take the time to write down your goals, you clarify them and 
sharpen your vision for attaining them, which allows you to do the following:
 
 Take control of your life. By identifying what’s most important to you 
and putting it on paper, you tell your brain that this isn’t a dream to be 
ignored as a hope-to, wish-to, or would-like-to. It’s really something for 
which you’re willing to invest time, effort, energy, and emotion.
 
 Map out the most direct route to achievement. When you put your goals 
in writing, you’re setting your sights on the destination before you begin. 
Your life goals become the framework for how you prioritize and manage 
your time. You begin the process of planning and strategizing about the 
steps you can take to achieve that goal. Your brain starts to look for the 
best, most direct route and the route with the lowest time investment.
 
 Limit detours. Ever hear the saying “If you don’t know where you’re 
going, any road will take you there”? Problem is, if you head off on just 
any road, you’re likely to end up in a place you don’t want to be. By 
documenting your goals, you can more easily gauge whether an effort 
is likely to bring you closer to or further away from them. With your 
goals in front of you, you make fewer wrong turns and invest less time in 
trial-and-error dead ends. If you know that “be an outstanding father” is 
at the top of your written list, then overtime, extra assignments, travel, 
and other actions that take you away from your kids won’t distract you 
as easily; you know you’re more likely to achieve this goal by spending 
time with your kids, going to their games, taking walks, throwing a ball, 
playing dress-up, going to the park, or writing a note.
 
 Stay motivated. Written goals fuel motivation, inducing you to perform 
at a higher level and at a faster rate in order to achieve.

23
 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
Establishing Your Fabulous 50
As you put together your list of goals, you need to consider the five core 
aspects of wants that I cover in this section. My mentor Jim Rohn taught 
them to me when I was in my 20s. These five questions dramatically reduced 
the amount of time I needed to achieve many of the goals that are now 
crossed off my goal sheets, and these same questions can help you expand 
your thinking so you can have more, be more, and achieve more.
As soon as you finish reading this section, read no further until you get your 
goals on paper. Your task after reading this section is to come up with at least 50 
goals that you want to accomplish within the next 10 years. As you brainstorm 
your list of goals, keep a few points in mind to make your goal-setting effective:
 
 Make sure your goals line up with your wants. Don’t evaluate goals 
based on what you think you need, deserve, or can realistically achieve; 
attack it by what you want. Your success is determined by how you 
invest your time each day.
 
 Think big. “Go big or go home” is a philosophy I encourage my clients 
and workshop participants to embrace. Many shy away from setting big 
goals for a range of reasons, from fear of disappointment to concern that 
they may not have the drive to pursue them.
 
 If you approach your dreams conservatively — going after what you think is 
reasonable or realistic — your odds of getting beyond that are slim to none. 
But if you let your imagination go and pursue the big dream, the odds of 
reaching that level of joy and fulfillment are in your favor. Big goals and big 
dreams cause you to stretch, strain, and go for what you really want in life. 
They connect with the best use of your time and energy.
 
 Pick a time somewhere in the future and work backward from there. 
For any goal that stretches further than ten years, break it down into 
smaller goals with shorter time frames to increase your focus, intensity, 
and commitment. See the later section “Assigning a time frame to each 
goal” for details.
 
 Make your goals measurable. When you establish a measurable, quanti-
fiable goal, you know you can’t fudge on whether you achieved it or not. 
You either hit the target or you don’t. You also know where you stand at 
any given time. Goal measurement naturally falls into two categories:
 
• Number-based goals: Measuring your progress toward a goal is 
pretty easy when the goal is number-based. You know when you’ve 
acquired a million dollars or lost 30 pounds, for example. The bank 
statement or scale is pretty simple to read. As you craft financial and 
other goals that are associated with numbers, be specific. Do you 
want to earn a certain annual salary? To put away a certain amount 
of money each year? To run a certain number of miles by September?

24
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
 
• Non-number-based goals: To measure a non-number-based goal, 
focus on how you’ll know when you’ve accomplished it. For exam-
ple, will some organization’s seal of approval establish you as a 
world-renowned archeologist? Will being elected president of the 
chamber of commerce constitute being a business leader in the 
community? Will having your children expressing greater thanks 
for your efforts as a parent equate to being a better dad or mom?
As you identify and record 50 goals you’d like to achieve in the next 10 years, 
contemplate the following 5 core questions to guide your goal setting.
What do you want to have?
The question of what you want to have focuses on material acquisitions. 
What possessions do you yearn for? A swimming pool? A sailboat? Do you 
fantasize about owning a sports car? Do you dream of a formal rose garden 
landscaped into your backyard? Someone to cook and clean for you? Your 
own private jet? Winter vacations in the Caribbean? If your home environ-
ment is a priority, imagine the place you want to live. An expansive ranch 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean? A Fifth Avenue penthouse? An off-the-grid 
abode that runs on solar and wind power? A villa in Tuscany?
 
Although possessions are important to consider, they’re typically a means to 
an end: They enable you to create the lifestyle that you want to have.
 
One of the best goals I set and achieved was to own two houses, one as my 
primary residence and one to which I could retreat. Achieving that goal also 
motivated me to better invest time during work hours so I could enjoy spend-
ing long weekends at my second home.
What do you want to see?
When you ask yourself what you want to see, think experiential acquisition. 
Travel is likely to be a key focus. I’m certain you can easily come up with at 
least ten places you want to see. Have some world wonders fascinated you? 
The Pyramids of Egypt? The Great Wall of China? I travel internationally a few 
times a year on business, and it only fuels my desire to see more parts of the 
world and expand my awareness of how other people live.
Your desire for new sights may lean toward unfamiliar geography — the 
desert lands of the Southwest if you’re a New England native or the Rocky 
Mountains in winter if you hail from a lowland home. Perhaps your see goals 
are more personal. You may have always wanted to visit the country your 
ancestors came from or even visit the small town in the Midwest where your 
great-grandparents met and raised a family.

25
 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
What do you want to do?
Most likely, many of your goals are connected with the question of what you 
want to do at some point in your life. Whereas the possessions you want 
to acquire help create your lifestyle, the action-oriented question you con-
sider here focuses more on bigger events and feats outside the daily realm. 
Because this category is vast, I have my clients consider three main aspects 
of this question:
 
 Activities: You may want to include some once-in-a-lifetime experiences, 
such as snorkeling with sea turtles or hiking Mt. Kilimanjaro. What about 
a goal of regular exercise four times a week? Or maybe you want to see 
Celine Dion in concert.
 
 Skills: For example, have you always wanted to speak Spanish or 
Mandarin Chinese? Do you wish you could play the piano or electric 
guitar? Have you put off a new experience — snow-skiing, surfing, fly 
fishing — because you thought it was too late to learn? Whether these 
skills can enhance your career or financial state or are simply actions 
that bring personal pleasure, cast a wide net and list the ones that 
intrigue you most.
 
 Career: How do you want to seek fulfillment through your career? 
Be honest with yourself and sort out how you’d like to measure that 
success. Do you yearn to be recognized as the top authority in your 
field? To win an international award? To write an influential book?
Using what works for you
Individualism is key when crafting your goals, 
and it applies to both what you record and 
how you record it. Perhaps typing your goals 
or entering them in an electronic spreadsheet 
is easiest for you. Or maybe you find that your 
thoughts flow best when you write them down 
by hand. The important thing to remember is 
that whatever method best enables your mind 
to flow freely and inspires you to craft your 
goals is the one you should use. Don’t let others 
sway you in how to craft and define your goals 
or what your goals should be.
Consider this little-known fact about yours truly: 
This is my third For Dummies book, and I’ve 
written all three books by hand. This archaic 
approach may seem ridiculous in today’s high-
tech publishing environment; dictating my 
thoughts into a recorder for transcription would 
certainly be easier and less time-consuming 
than writing everything by hand. But not for me. 
For whatever reason, the direct connection 
among my hand, pen, eyes, and brain enables 
me to create a better book. Inspiration comes to 
me frequently while writing thoughts down, so I 
stick to my routine and get someone with more 
time to type my writing into an electronic file.

What do you want to give?
Andrew Carnegie, the great steel entrepreneur, met his goal to amass a 
fortune in the first half of his life. His goal for the second half was to give it 
all away. Many of the public libraries in the United States, Canada, and the 
United Kingdom exist today because of his philanthropy.
An important way to balance all the want, see, and do items on your Fabulous 
50 list is to include give goals as well. What are you willing or interested in 
giving back? How do you want to share your good fortune with others? Which 
causes are near and dear to you?
 
Your give list may include specific monetary goals — “give 10 percent of my 
income to charity” — but you may find more fulfillment by tying in your giving 
goals to your other interests. For example, if your career aspirations involve 
writing a bestseller, supporting a charity that champions literacy or volunteer-
ing to teach adults to read may be goals that touch a chord with you. If you 
dream of traveling to exotic destinations, you may participate in a humanitar-
ian mission, bringing medicine and other important supplies to people in a 
developing country. If you care deeply about environmental initiatives, maybe 
you want to look into ecotourism or green volunteering opportunities.
Who do you want to become?
To a degree, what you want to have, see, do, and give determine the person 
you want to become. But you should still envision and write down how you see 
Appreciating personal growth
Consider this true-life story: I made my first 
million by the time I was in my early 30s, but I 
can wholeheartedly say the value I gained from 
attaining that goal wasn’t the money (which, 
unfortunately, I lost a pretty good chunk of 
through some poor investments I made). Of 
deeper and lasting value are the personal char-
acteristics and skills that I gained through the 
process of strategizing, acting, and investing 
my time on my way toward the goal. Because 
I’d changed as a person as a result of the 
process, the steps toward reaching that goal 
again weren’t nearly so challenging, and the 
characteristics I developed through the process 
enabled me to meet other goals as well.
I grew with each new goal I worked toward. 
To reach my goals in real estate sales, I had 
to increase my focus and discipline. When I 
decided to go into coaching and speaking, I 
had to develop better behavioral analysis and 
leadership to get others to follow my coaching 
and teaching. And to reach my goal of writing 
books that would help readers achieve suc-
cess, I had to gather new skills in organization, 
critical thinking, and patience due to all these 
editors in the publishing business.

 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
yourself developing while you achieve these goals. The real value of goals isn’t 
what you achieve — it’s in the accumulation of knowledge, skills, discipline, and 
experience you gain through learning, changing, improving, and investing your-
self as you work toward your goals. Often, those newly discovered or carefully 
developed traits are the only lasting acquisition that stands the test of time.
Don’t get me wrong — I’m not suggesting that you become someone other 
than who you are; rather, I’m encouraging you to earnestly and honestly 
evaluate the characteristics and disciplines best suited for your ambitions. 
To identify the areas you should focus on, take a look at all the goals you’ve 
written down so far (if you haven’t yet read the preceding sections, complete 
them before moving on here). Then ask yourself the following questions 
when considering your goals as a whole:
 
 What personal characteristics do you need to change or improve? Do 
you need assertiveness training to deal more effectively with your boss or 
co-workers? Do you need to work on interpersonal skills? Does your anger 
get in the way of your success because you get frustrated so easily?
 
 What disciplines do you need to work harder at practicing consis-
tently? Are you able to delay gratification and do what you need to when 
it needs to be done? Are you able to save regular amounts from your 
current paycheck, or are you waiting to make more money before you 
start the savings process? What if that extra money never shows up?
 
If you’re struggling to identify areas where you need to work on personal 
development, take at look at people who have achieved what you want; then 
evaluate your characteristics and disciplines as compared to theirs.
Labeling and Balancing 
Your Fabulous 50
After you draft a list of the 50 goals you want to achieve in the next 10 
years, your next task is to assign a category and time frame to each of them. 
Creating categories for your goals and establishing time frames to achieve 
them sharpens your focus and increases your intensity, which can reduce the 
time required to achieve your goals. It also allows you to quickly and easily 
see whether your time investment to the various areas of your life as well as 
the size and difficulty of your goals are appropriately balanced.
 
The objective isn’t to spread an equal number and depth of goals among the 
six categories; the aim is to identify whether one or two of the categories is 
light compared to the others and to determine whether you need to pay more 
attention to those areas of your life to develop them. In the end, the purpose 
is to create a well-rounded system of goals that addresses your whole person 
and that you’ll have the motivation to actually work toward.

Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Assigning a time frame to each goal
I firmly believe you can have anything you want; you just can’t have it all at 
once and all right now. Just because you establish a goal to lose 20 pounds 
doesn’t mean you’ll wake up tomorrow with 20 pounds missing from your body. 
Realizing your goal involves a process that requires specific activity and time.
 
There are no unrealistic goals, but there may be unrealistic time frames. The 
world is full of people who have accomplished great things with the applica-
tion of extensive time. Edison, for example, was said to have failed in excess 
of 10,000 times in his search for the right filament for the incandescent light 
bulb. Imagine the time frame necessary to fail 10,000 times!
Remember that your Fabulous 50 list names goals that you want to accomplish 
within the next 10 years. That said, you may want to see some of them come to 
fruition much earlier. Some may be immediate — just a year away. Others may 
require you to first achieve some intermediate goals. For instance, say your 
goal is to double your income within three years. You know you’re unlikely to 
receive anywhere close to a 100-percent raise at your current job, so you start 
exploring other options: a new job that pays more and has a fast-track career 
path, a second job, freelance or contract projects that you can do on your 
off-hours, or a real-estate investment that brings in rental income.
Before you head to the next section, go back through your list of 50 goals 
(which you create earlier in “Establishing Your Fabulous 50”) and write a 1, 
3, 5, or 10 next to each goal to indicate whether you want to achieve that goal 
within 1, 3, 5, or 10 years.
 
When you start thinking about the time you need to attain your goals, make 
sure you’re being reasonable. Whether or not the time frame for your goals 
is reasonable depends entirely on your situation. To help you stay on track, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Consider the time frame you’d ideally like to accomplish this goal.
 
 Would you be happy if you accomplished it one year or even three years 
later than your ideal, or are you intent on accomplishing it by a certain 
time?
 
2. Assess the complexity of the goal.
 
3. Determine what new knowledge or other resources you may need 
to accomplish the goal.
 
 See the “Pinpointing Resource Needs” section, later in this chapter, 
for guidance.
 
4. Consider what time frame someone else needed to accomplish a 
similar goal.

29
 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
After you label each goal with a time frame, tally up the number of goals you have 
for each time slot and record those totals in Figure 2-1. Then assess the spread of 
your goals across those time frames to see whether they’re well balanced.

Especially when finances are involved, keep in mind that you should enjoy 
the process of working toward your goals. Although planning for the future is 
important, you’re guaranteed only the present. You don’t want to rob yourself 
of all enjoyment now — better to live a balanced life while you implement your 
plan and adjust it as needed when circumstances throw you for a loop.
Categorizing your goals
After you assign a time frame to each of your 50 goals, your next step is to assign 
a category to each one. Typically, your goals fall into one of six categories:
C = Career
F = Family
H = Health
M = Money/financial
P = Personal
S = Spiritual
When determining which category each goal falls under, you’ll find that some 
goals fall naturally in one specific category. A goal to get be promoted to super-
visor at work, for example, is an easy C. Other goals, however, aren’t so easy 
to peg. Going back to school to earn an MBA may be a C for career, but it also 
may be a P for personal. Place the goal in whichever category you most closely 
associate with it or feel free to place some goals in multiple categories.
Now go back through your list of 50 goals and write the appropriate category 
letter next to each one. After you label each goal with a category, count the 

30
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
total number of goals you have for each category and record those numbers 
in Figure 2-2. Then assess the spread of your goals across those categories to 
see whether they’re well balanced. Are you light on health goals? Should you 
pay more attention to your spiritual life?

Targeting 12 Goals to Start With
At this point, you should have a list of 50 goals you want to accomplish over 
the next 10 years, all labeled according to the time frame you want to achieve 
them in and the aspect of your life that they fall under (see the preceding sec-
tion). A large list ensures you have new goals to move to when you accom-
plish your first goals. However, concentrating on all your goals at once leads 
to frustration, distraction, and ultimately, failure.
The next step is to break down your list of 50 into some manageable chunks, 
which helps you focus your energy where you need it most. You won’t allow 
others to interrupt you as frequently, and you’ll work with a greater sense of 
urgency because you have things to do, places to go, people to meet, things 
to see, time frames in which to accomplish them, and goals to cross off.
Narrowing down your list
To whittle your long list of goals down to a manageable size, choose the three 
most important goals within each time frame: three that you want to achieve 
within one year, three before the three-year point, three within five years, 
and the last trio within ten years.

31
 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
 
As you accomplish goals on your top-12 list, revisit your Fabulous 50 and reca-
librate your top 12, adding new goals and crossing off the ones you’ve com-
pleted. Keep reviewing your goals on at least a monthly basis. You want to see 
the progress you’re making. With your increasing confidence, you’re likely to 
feel more comfortable with more daring, bolder, and challenging goals. And by 
resetting your goals, you continue to stoke that momentum.
Noting why your top-12 goals 
are important to you
Too frequently, people fixate on how they’ll accomplish or achieve some-
thing. However, the real magic to achieving goals is contained in the why. If 
the why is large enough, the how becomes easy.
It’s been nearly 20 years since I first read Napoleon Hill’s landmark book, 
Think and Grow Rich! He guided me to delve deep within myself to explore 
the whys of my aspirations and motivations — and so much more. I’m now 
known worldwide for my success in real estate sales and my ability to sell 
150-plus homes a year on a four-day work week. That was no accident — it 
was a goal of mine from the start, and I’m certain I’ve succeeded because I 
had a clear understanding of the why behind it.
 
Here’s my story: My dad worked a four-day week when I was growing up. He 
was always around on Friday when I came home from school. But the biggest 
benefit came in the summer, when we left Portland every Thursday afternoon 
to spend three days at a second home on a lake near the Oregon coast. Some 
of my fondest childhood memories are of swimming, sailing, waterskiing, walk-
ing the beach, and playing at our lake house. I wanted to replicate that life 
exactly. As I built my real estate sales business, that desire drove my success. 
It led me to build a vacation home in Bend, Oregon, where Joan and I spent 
three days a week for more than five years.
 
Although my why happened to come from a positive childhood experience, 
keep in mind that reasons can just as easily come from a negative place — 
either way, they’re motivating factors to keep you pressing on. Thousands of 
success stories have germinated from the seeds of abject poverty or personal 
tragedy. My father’s why, for example, was born out of his love for my mother, 
who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when I was three years old. By the 
time I was in the second grade, she never took another step. My father’s goal 
was to earn enough income as a dentist to provide my mother with the most 
extraordinary life possible: to travel in a wheelchair to Mexico, Asia, Hawaii 
(annually), and many other locations — always with three sons in tow. 
But mostly, he wanted to be able to care for her in her in the home where 
she raised her children and to give her the best quality of life imaginable for 
someone in her condition.

32
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
As a coach, I can only ask questions and guide you to your unique whys, 
regardless of whether they come from happy memories, adversity, or the 
love and commitment to another. After you determine which 12 goals you’ll 
start on, evaluate why each one is important to you and write it down. Why 
did you choose these 12 goals over the others? What will these goals accom-
plish for you? What are you going to feel like when you accomplish them and 
cross them off your list?
 
Reading your goals list aloud is a great way to assist your subconscious 
processes. This action reinforces the message in your brain. Regular repeti-
tion and review, coupled with your solid grasp of the whys, keeps your goals 
front-of-mind — even when they’re at the back of your mind!
Pinpointing Your Resource Needs
Achieving your goals requires resources, be they money, contacts, knowl-
edge, skills, time, and so on — or all the above. Some fortunate folks may 
have an abundant supply of all resources, but most are short on at least a 
couple. I may have the income to allow me to train to become a world-class 
figure skater, but because I lack the skill, I’m unlikely to have enough time 
to become good enough to achieve the goal of qualifying for the 2014 Winter 
Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
Even if you approach your goals with an imbalance of resources, by carefully 
leveraging those that you have at your disposal, you can overcome many 
shortfalls. If you’re lacking in one or more resources, you may have to invest 
more of the resources you have. Take my Olympics example: I’m short on 
time and skill, so I may need to invest more money to devote myself to full-
time training, or I may have to borrow time and aim for the 2018 Olympics, 
instead.
As you read through the following sections, evaluate the resource require-
ments for achievement for each of the top 12 goals that you identify earlier in 
this chapter. When you complete this step of the goal-setting process, you’ll 
have an effective set of goals that you can integrate into your time schedule, 
which I discuss in depth in Chapter 4.
Accruing funds: A capital idea
Most goals, if they aren’t about money, seem to require money — building 
your dream home, taking a cruise, sending your kids to an Ivy League school, 
opening your own coffee shop. Even a goal such as landing a job at a high-
powered corporation, which seems to be about earning money, may require 
you to get some additional education or purchase suitable interview attire.

33
 Chapter 2: Linking Time Management to Life Goals
If you find that your goal requires capital, do your best to quantify the 
amount. Then determine whether you have enough money to achieve your 
goal or whether you need more. Ask the following questions:
 
 Do you have time to earn the amount needed to fund your endeavor?
 
 Can you borrow the money?
 
 Can you leverage another of your resources to balance the shortfall?
Expanding your knowledge
Knowledge can dramatically increase the prospects of attaining your goal in 
the time table you’ve established. Trial and error is a costly means to reach 
your destination — especially when it comes to time investment. So if you 
assess your success-list goals and determine that you need more information 
to succeed, ask the following:
 
 What, exactly, is the knowledge you need to realize your goal?
 
 What’s the best way to attain that knowledge? Formal study? Online 
research? Talking with experts?
 
 How long will gaining this knowledge take, and does it fit in with your 
goal’s time frame?
Honing your skill set
For the fulfillment of many goals, additional skills are required. Don’t confuse 
knowledge with skill. Knowledge entails the gathering and processing of infor-
mation in a way that you can use to gain a deeper understanding of a subject. 
Skill involves putting that understanding into effective action. You can study 
the heart and understand how it works — even know how bypass surgery 
works to prevent heart failure — but you don’t want to perform such a proce-
dure without having the skill of an experienced surgeon.
Examine your success list again to evaluate where additional skills may be 
necessary:
 
 What skills are required for each goal?
 
 Are these skills that you already claim, or do you need to acquire them?
 
 Are these skills that you can learn within the time frame? If not, then 
how can you make up for that skill shortage? Can you find someone who 
has the skills and ask for his or her help?

34
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Tapping into human resources
Most people have accomplished what they have because someone else helped 
them along the way, so don’t overlook the people component as you tally up 
your resources. The right contacts can be valuable in helping you attain your 
goals. Consider that dream of working for the high-powered corporation, for 
instance. Knowing someone who works for the company — or who has inside 
connections — is one of the best ways to get your foot in the door. But people 
resources can help in achieving other types of goals as well, from buying that 
cabin in the woods (Uncle Sydney always believed that real estate is the best 
investment) to learning to play the saxophone (the waiter at the local coffee 
shop is only too happy to earn some extra money giving lessons). Here are 
some questions to ask yourself as you evaluate your human resources:
 
 Do you know anyone who achieved a goal similar to yours, someone 
who may be willing to advise you?
 
 If you need additional schooling but are short on funds, do you know 
people who may be able to help you acquire the knowledge you need, or 
can you utilize their talents?
 
 Do you know someone who has the knowledge, skill, connections, or 
money that you need to reach your goal?
 
 Can you tap into your people resources and use the skills of someone 
else to compensate for skills you can’t attain yourself?
 
 Do you know someone who knows someone else who may be able to 
help you?
 
Think of ways that the people you plan to approach can benefit if you attain 
your goal. Can you compensate them monetarily for their help? Can you offer 
something in trade that has value for them? Even just asking for help and 
saying thank you in advance is enough for some people. (Though many times, 
people are more willing to help when there’s something in it for them.)
If you can’t find anyone to help, you’re forced to take the personal education 
route. The good thing, though, is that lots of books, classes, and seminars are 
available to help you, so take advantage of them.

epending on your values, different kinds of numbers may be important 
to you: To some, it’s cholesterol count and blood pressure figures; to 
others, it’s the number of years they’ve been married. To many, the sum total 
in the retirement account is the number-one number, and some people zero 
in on the amount left on their mortgage.
But I contend that your per-hour worth should be among the top-of-mind 
numbers that are important to you — no matter what your values or priori-
ties are — even if you don’t earn your living on a per-hour rate. Knowing the 
value of your time enables you to make wise decisions about where and how 
you spend it so you can make the most of this limited resource according to 
your circumstances, goals, and interests.
Obviously, the higher you raise your per-hour worth while upholding your 
priorities, the more you can propel your efforts toward meeting your goals, 
because you have more resources at your disposal — you have either more 
money or more time, whichever you need most.
In this chapter, I guide you toward optimizing your value so you can reap 
the rewards and attain what’s most important to you. I start by showing you 
why your hourly value is crucial to effective time management. From there, I 
help you calculate the overall value of your time based on your employment 
income. (If you have an hourly job, you can skip that section.) Then I help 
you decide how to leverage your time and money, both in your career efforts 
and in your personal choices, so you can boost your hourly value and get the 
most out of your time investment.

36
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Getting a Good Grip on the 
Time-Equals-Money Concept
Your per-hour value translates to your quality of life, both now and in the 
future. Not only does your income influence how you spend your nonworking 
hours, but it also determines how much leisure time you have to spend.
As you can imagine, your hourly value reaches beyond the basics: It impacts 
your health, too. For instance, studies show that lower-income earners have 
more health problems, including heart disease and diabetes, which are often 
attributed to poor diets and a lack of medical care. Additionally, the chal-
lenge of trying to make ends meet can cause great stress, leading not just to 
physical illness but also to depression and other mental health problems.
And though it’s important to live in the present, it’s also important to keep 
an eye toward the future. How well you prepare does have an impact on your 
quality of life right now. Making enough money to be able to save for retire-
ment and other major life expenses — including a child’s education — results 
in a sense of comfort and safety about your future.
Your personal time has value, too. And by having a grip on the value of your 
work hours, you gain a better grasp on what your downtime is worth. After 
all, most people work so they can make the most of their personal time, 
whether they’re devoting it to family, hobbies, volunteer work, travel, or 
education.
 
When you recognize that your free time has a monetary value just as your 
work time does, you gain the perspective you need to make choices:
 
 Is the extra money you’ll gain by working overtime worth giving up your 
holiday with your family?
 
 Could you go part-time and stay at home with your small children?
 
 Can you afford to take a leave of absence to do a volunteer stint in Haiti?
 
 Should you take on a freelance project that means giving up all your free 
time for three months to fund your dream trip to Bali?
But what is an hour of your personal time worth? Well, that’s not a question 
you can easily answer. How do you put a price on time with your young chil-
dren? Or apply a dollar value to travel experiences that bring you in touch 
with new worlds? Or equate the quiet therapy of a walk in the woods with the 
stress of a work presentation?
The harsh truth is that you don’t get paid for not working. But that doesn’t 
mean your personal time has no monetary value. Just thinking about your 
time as a commodity with a value helps you sort through and recognize the 

37
 Chapter 3: Putting a Value on Your Time
activities that are most important to you. (For information on valuing your 
personal time, see the later section “Making Value-Based Time Decisions in 
Your Personal Life.”)
Calculating Your Hourly Income
No matter your occupation, everyone sells time for a price; it’s just a lot more 
transparent in some situations than others. Most obvious are individuals who 
receive a wage or a fee based on the hours they work, including minimum-
wage workers and self-employed individuals such as tutors, house cleaners, 
and consultants.
Other people advertise their prices based on a per-project basis, but in real-
ity base that fee on an estimate of project hours the job takes. Freelance 
writers, for instance, may charge $1,500 to write a promotional brochure, but 
that amount is likely a reflection of the writer’s value of his or her time at a 
certain figure — say, $75 per hour.
Some businesses and professions charge customers based on an hourly rate, 
although workers don’t directly receive that per-hour fee. Instead, their salary 
or compensation is based on the revenue the company can bring in based on 
those hours. Law firms and plumbers, for example, may charge for their ser-
vices on an hourly basis and pay their employees a salary or a per-hour rate.
 
If you earn a salary, you may not perceive yourself as having an hourly rate. 
But everyone does. Here’s how to calculate your hourly income. This number 
doesn’t affect how you’re paid, but it puts you in touch with what an hour of 
your work time brings you.
 
1. Calculate the number of hours you work per week.
 
 Work hours/day × days/week + overtime = hours/week
 
 To be completely accurate, calculate your hourly rate based on the 
hours you actually work. If you consistently put in more than 40 hours 
a week (most salaried folks aren’t paid overtime for additional hours 
worked), add those hours to your total. Here’s an example:
 
 8 hours/day × 5 days/week + 2 hours overtime = 42 hours/week
 
2. Figure out how many hours you work per year.
 
 Work hours/week × weeks/year = hours/year
 
 Make sure you subtract time off. For instance, if you take three weeks 
of vacation each year, subtract that from your total number of weeks 
worked. If your salary is based on a three-week vacation and an average 
42-hour work week, here’s how many hours you work per year:
 
 42 hours/week × 49 weeks/year = 2,058 hours/year

38
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
 
3. Divide your gross salary by the number of hours you work per year.
 
 Salary ÷ hours/year = hourly income
 
 For instance, $80,000 divided by 2,058 hours is $38.87.
Boosting Your Hourly Value 
through Your Work Efforts
 
Money isn’t the scarcest and most valuable resource; time is. There are plenty 
of ways to make more money, but there’s no way to add more minutes to an 
hour. You have a limited amount of this precious commodity, so you want to 
protect it and spend it as if it’s your own personal trust fund.
Most people think that if they work more hours, they’ll automatically make more 
money. That’s faulty thinking: You can devote more hours to work, but if you 
invest the hours in the wrong actions, you gain nothing — and you lose time.
The solution may be to ask more money for your time. Some workers have 
a good deal of control over their hourly income and can therefore charge 
more per hour for their services. The freelance writer can raise her hourly 
rate from $65 to $70 and bring in an additional $50 on a 10-hour project. A 
tax accountant can increase the fee for income tax preparation from $450 
to $510. If he needs six hours to prepare the average income tax return, the 
accountant just gave himself an increase from $75 to $85 an hour.
However, the simple fact is that most people don’t have the luxury of raising 
their income at will. So what’s the next best step? Change how you use your 
time so you get the best return on investment — after all, what you do with 
your time leads to greater prosperity.
To increase your hourly value, you have to decide whether you’ll work toward 
earning more money or earning more time. Then focus on performing high-
value activities to achieve that goal; the process of discovering the really 
important actions or items you can invest your time in can help you change 
your hourly rate. The decision of how to increase your hourly value — whether 
to work toward generating more money in the same amount of time or generat-
ing the same amount of money in less time — depends on your circumstances:
 
 If you’re in a commission or bonus compensation structure, you can 
increase productivity to earn additional income.
 
 If you’re in a salary-based position, you can find ways to be more produc-
tive within the 40 hours week and reduce the additional hours you put in.

39
 Chapter 3: Putting a Value on Your Time
If, however, your job doesn’t enable you to increase your hourly value, 
whether in terms of money or time, then you have bigger decisions to make. 
Other changes you can make to directly impact your income are to simply do 
the following:
 
 Find a similar job at a company that pays a bigger salary or offers more 
freedom with your work hours.
 
 Improve your performance and earn a raise or a promotion. Know, how-
ever, that the success of your efforts toward a raise or promotion is ulti-
mately up to the higher-ups.
 
When evaluating time-for-money trades, be sure not to limit your definition of 
return to money: Ask yourself whether the exchange improves the quality of 
your life. Look at how your life would change outside of work if you were to 
double or triple your hourly rate. If what you’re trading for dollars does any 
of the following, it’s a good trade:
 
 Increases your ability and opportunity to earn more money
 
 Increases your amount of family time
 
 Decreases your work hours
 
 Enhances your physical and mental fitness
 
 Provides an opportunity for someone who needs it
 
 Removes something you don’t enjoy or don’t do well from your life
So that’s a simple look at the overall strategy behind improving your return 
on investment. Chapter 4 takes you through the specifics, helping you sched-
ule your to-do list each day so you make sure all your efforts align with your 
goals, which you outline in Chapter 2.
Making Value-Based Time Decisions 
in Your Personal Life
When you consider the way you live your personal life, divide your focus in 
two: chores/responsibilities and leisure time. Although personal time may 
seem straightforward, there really is a difference between chores and leisure 
activities, and the way you approach your time-management decisions hinges 
on that difference. But however you spend your personal time, you can 
assign that time a value equal to your work worth — even though no one’s 
paying you — to help you decide how to spend it.

40
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Deciding whether to buy time: 
Chores and responsibilities
When you have a handle on the value of your time in hourly increments (see 
the earlier section “Calculating Your Hourly Income”), you have the infor-
mation you need to make better time choices. The chores have to be done, 
whether you do them, or delegate, or even pay someone else to do them. The 
question with chores is whether you want to do them yourself or to exchange 
dollars for someone else to do them. You have to ask, “Is the cost of the time 
this task would take me greater than or less than the cost to hire someone to 
do the work?” Here, you’re simply comparing numbers. Think of the laundry 
list of household chores and personal errands that can eat up every bit of 
personal time you have. If you could pay someone to do some of those tasks 
at a rate equal to or well below your hourly rate, wouldn’t that be a good 
return on investment?
For example, paying $50 to have your grass cut each week may have been a 
cost barrier you couldn’t get over before. But if you’ve determined that the 
hourly value of your time is $50 per hour and it takes you 3 hours to mow your 
Helping kids understand the 
time-versus-money balance
Business travel can eat up a lot of the personal 
time you count on for recreation and renewal. 
You may still tie up your workday at 5:30 p.m., 
but instead of going home to the family, you 
retreat to your hotel room for the night. And 
your weekend may be consumed with long 
travel days to get home.
I know the price of a job that requires business 
travel. It’s a price that I pay, my wife pays, and 
my kids pay. By the end of the year, I’ll have 
traveled to five different continents speaking 
to sales organizations in countries around the 
world. I’ll be away from my family for days — 
and in some cases, weeks — at a time.
When my son Wesley was 5, I was getting 
ready to leave for a week of speaking engage-
ments. He was crying and begging me not to 
go. When I see my children cry, I’m a pushover, 
but I knew I couldn’t not go, so after I saw that 
all my reassurances weren’t working to stop his 
tears, I went out on a limb and tried to reason 
with my son.
I explained to him that I already promised the 
people that I’d be there and it wouldn’t be right 
for me not to show up. I assured him that if he 
wanted me to, I’d be willing to stop speaking 
and spend more time at home. But we’d all have 
to make some changes: We’d have to sell our 
home and buy a smaller one because Daddy 
would be making less money. We would need 
to cut some things out of our budget like some 
vacations, eating out, toys — the new bike he’d 
been asking for. I wound up my explanation and 
asked him gently, “Do you understand?” He 
looked at me thoughtfully for a second and then 
said, “Bye, Dad. See you later.” And off he ran.

 Chapter 3: Putting a Value on Your Time
lawn, you’ve just bought yourself $100 worth of time ($150 worth of your time 
minus $50 to outsource the work). On the other hand, if you have all kinds 
of free time on the weekend — and you enjoy being out in the yard — paying 
someone else to cut your grass may be a money-time trade that has no value 
for you.
If you love to garden but hate cleaning the house, and cleaning the house 
takes you 4 hours ($200 if your time is worth $50 per hour), why not pay a 
housecleaning service $70, $80, even $100 to buy back the four hours it’d take 
you to do it all? And you buy yourself four blissful hours puttering over your 
zinnias and scarlet runner beans.
Making time-spending decisions: 
Leisure activities
With leisure activities, your decision simply hinges on whether you want to 
do them at all. Unlike chores, which you have to deal with in some way, you 
can get away with forgoing certain pastimes. When you’re faced with deci-
sions on whether to accept an invitation or volunteer for a committee or do 
any other activity, that can affect your leisure time.
Looking at rewards
 
A leisure activity has to bring you as much joy or value as your hourly income 
rate. Some things you do will be priceless, but others are worthless or even 
less than worthless because they drain you rather than fill you up. So with lei-
sure activities, you aren’t comparing numbers — you simply decide whether a 
given activity is worth your hourly value. Consider the value of the activity in 
terms of
 
 Your personal enjoyment
 
 The service you want to do for someone
 
 The support to those who are less fortunate than yourself
 
 The desire to pay it forward
 
 The legacy you want to leave to others
Factoring in monetary and time costs
Another factor to consider when choosing leisure activities is the cost of 
your free time. Often, that time isn’t so free — you undertake activities that 
require some recreational funds. When you have to pay to enjoy certain 
recreational or leisure activities, take the cost of the activity and add it to 
the monetary time-cost you’d have to pay for the activity. In short, would 
you pay the cost in your hourly value (plus any costs of the activity itself) to 
participate in that activity?

42
Part I: Beginning the Revolution: Simple Steps to Start With 
Say your income equates to $35 an hour. If an acquaintance you’re not all 
that crazy about invites you to her jewelry party on a weeknight, you’d be 
looking at, say, a 2-hour cost of $70, plus any money you’d spend while there. 
Should you go? Probably not, if this acquaintance really isn’t someone you 
prefer to spend your time with.
Or how about this scenario? A local nonprofit asks you to be on a committee 
that requires an average of 10 hours per month. Total value: $350 worth of 
your time each month. Is the value earned from your time donation worth the 
cost to you? How does it factor into your overall goals? Do you enjoy being 
on the committee and do you feel passionate about the nonprofit’s mission? 
Do you have other more important things you have to tend to first?
The money-to-time-value consideration extends to even the seemingly most 
mundane of activities — for example, dining out. Going out to a 2-hour dinner 
with a family of four may rack up $80 or more. If you earn $80 in one hour, 
this may seem like a fair trade — you’re paying $80 for something that would 
cost you $160 in time. But if your income is $20 per hour, you’re essentially 
paying $80 for something that’s worth only $40 in time. That may seem steep 
for a midweek convenience grab; however, if you’re celebrating your child’s 
first straight-A report card, it may feel like a fairer trade.
How about a week of vacation? Travel, hotel, and food on the road can 
add up fast. If you and your partner total up $3,000 in expenses for a beach 
resort getaway, at $80 an hour, that’s not quite a week’s worth (37.5) of work 
hours — not a bad deal, you may think. The fact of the matter is this: The 
decision of whether an activity is worth its cost is completely subjective. 
That idea is certainly empowering and freeing, as long as you make conscious 
choices about where you dole out your hours.
Staying open to experiences and using time wisely
 
The process of evaluating your leisure time is meant to help you use your time 
well, not to limit your experiences. If you’re unsure about a certain activity 
but you had fun and found it worthwhile in the past, you should probably go. 
Also consider going if it’s part of your current or future goals. If you enjoy the 
people but not an activity, you can suggest a change of venue and make the 
outing more worthwhile.
If you give up activities and find yourself mindlessly wasting the time you 
gained in front of the TV or online, you likely need more clarity in your goals. 
Or your goals may not be compelling enough. Chapter 2 can help you sort out 
your goals and pinpoint the activities you find most fulfilling.

With the valuable 80/20 rule and time-blocking techniques 
detailed in Chapter 4, you’re well-armed to take control of

W
hat you do with your time is more important than how much time you 
have. Just as recognizing and understanding your life goals helps you 
achieve successful time management skills, the effective use of your time goes 
a long, long way to shortening the journey to those goals. By investing your 
time with care and consideration, your journey toward your dreams is certain 
to be a smoother road. In fact, an old time-management adage says that for 
every minute you invest in planning, you save 10 minutes in execution. Spend 
an hour planning your trip, and you’ll free up 10 hours — to achieve better 
business results, reduce stress, and add quality time at home.
The best way to achieve your goals is to prioritize them and develop an 
ordered plan to reach them. A universally recognized method for maximizing 
productivity, called the 80/20 rule, has proven successful time and again, for 
more than 100 years. In this chapter, I explain the general concept and show 
you how to apply it — at work, at home, in your relationships, and beyond.
People who are most productive have another common trait: They treat 
everything in life as an appointment. These people value their time and the 
activities to which they commit, whether business or personal. They lend 
importance to their duties, commitments, and activities by writing them 
down and giving them a time slot, whether they’re one-time occurrences or 
regular activities. They even make appointments with themselves.

46
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
To ensure you act on your priorities in the order that’s most important to 
you, you need to follow a method to your scheduling — and that’s what this 
chapter is all about. Here, I help you match your overall time investment to 
your goals (which you outline in Chapter 2), prioritize your tasks, and create 
a schedule to take you safely to your destination.
Focusing Your Energy with the 
80/20 Theory of Everything
In 1906, Vilfredo Pareto noted that in his home country of Italy, a small con-
tingency of citizens — about 20 percent — held most of the power, influence, 
and money — about 80 percent, he figured. That, of course, meant that the 
other 80 percent of the population held only 20 percent of the financial and 
political power in the country. Pareto found a similar distribution in other 
nations. In the 1940s, Joseph M. Juran applied the same 80:20 ratio to quality 
control issues, and since then the business world has run with idea of the 
“vital few and trivial many.”
The basic principle that in all things, only a few are vital and many are trivial 
is known as the 80/20 rule (also referred to as the Pareto principle), and you 
can apply it to almost any situation. I’ve heard it used in the workplace (“20 
percent of my staff makes 80 percent of the revenue”) and even by investors 
(“20 percent of my stocks generate 80 percent of my income”). You can also 
apply the 80/20 rule to time management, as I explain in this section.
Matching time investment to return
Generally speaking, only 20 percent of those things that you spend your time 
doing produces 80 percent of the results that you want to achieve. This prin-
ciple applies to virtually every situation in which you have to budget your 
time in order to get things done — whether at work, at home, in your rela-
tionships, and so on.
 
The goal in using the 80/20 rule to maximize your productivity is to identify 
the key 20-percent activities that are most effective (producing 80 percent of 
the results) and make sure you prioritize those activities. Complete those vital 
tasks above all else and perhaps look for ways to increase the time you spend 
on them.

47
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
In this section, I show you how to implement the 80/20 rule.
Step 1: Sizing up your current situation
Before you can do any sort of strategizing, you need to take a good, honest 
look at how you use your time. For people who struggle with time manage-
ment, the problem, by and large, lies in the crucial steps of assessing and 
planning. Start your assessment with these steps:
 
1. Observe how you currently use your time.
 
 Through the observation process, you can discover behaviors, habits, 
and skill sets that both negatively and positively affect your productiv-
ity. What do you spend most of your day doing? How far down the daily 
to-do list do you get each day?
 
2. Assess your personal productivity trends.
 
 During which segments of the day are your energy levels the highest? 
Which personal habits cause you to adjust your plans for the day?
 
3. Take a close look at the interruptions you face on a regular basis.
 
 During what segments of the day do you experience the most interrup-
tions? What sort of interruptions do you receive most frequently, and 
from whom?
Later in the chapter, in “Blocking Off Your Time and Plugging in Your To-Do 
Items,” I explain how to control and plan for your time through time-blocking 
your day.
Step 2: Identifying the top tasks that support your goals
Some folks tend to follow the squeeze-it-in philosophy: They cram in every-
thing they possibly can — and then some. These people almost always end 
up miserable because they try to do so much that they don’t take care of 
their basic needs and end up strung out in every possible way. The quality 
of what they do, as well as the amount of what they do, suffers as a result of 
their ever-increasing exhaustion.
To work efficiently, you need to identify your 80 percent — the results you 
want to achieve. Break out your list of goals (which I help you think through 
and record in Chapter 2). Take a good look at your top 12 goals and identify 
the tasks you need to do that align with those goals. If your number-one goal 
is to provide your kids with an Ivy League education, for example, then your 
priorities are less likely to center around taking twice-yearly vacations to the 
Caribbean and more likely to revolve around investing wisely and encourag-
ing your offspring to do well in school (can you say “full-ride scholarship?”).

48
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
After you identify what you need to do — your vital few — spend a bit more 
time in self-reflection to double-check that you’ve correctly identified your 
goals and essential tasks. One of the biggest wastes of time for people is 
changing direction, priorities, objectives, and goals. Successful people and 
successful time managers take the direct route from point A to point B.
Here’s what to ask yourself about these key tasks:
 
 How much time do you devote to those activities? Twenty percent? 
Less? More?
 
 What are you doing with the remainder of your time?
 
 How much return are you getting for the investment on the remainder?
Step 3: Prioritizing your daily objectives
After you identify the tasks and activities that you need to accomplish to 
achieve your goals, assign a value to those goals so you can decide how to 
order your daily task list.
Take the send-your-kids-to-an-Ivy-League school scenario that I bring up in 
the preceding section: Even though another of your priorities is to be home 
for your kids, you — as a nonworking parent who values the type of educa-
tion you can provide for your 3-going-on-18-year-old more than the short-term 
joy of being a stay-at-home parent — may decide to return to the workforce 
as you see tuitions skyrocketing. You can make this decision because you 
have a clear idea about how you rank your priorities. This clarity may help 
direct you to a job with hours compatible with your kid’s schedule.
To personalize how you prioritize your goals at work, follow these steps:
 
1. Look at your long-term career goals.
 
 Do you want to advance to a particular career level? Do you want to 
achieve a particular income? Or is your goal to fine-tune your skill set 
before figuring out where you want to go next?
 
2. Review your company’s priorities.
 
 Having a solid understanding of the company’s priorities, goals, objec-
tives, and strategic thrusts guides your own prioritization so you can 
get the edge on the company’s competition. To get a global perspective, 
review your company’s mission statement, review its published corpo-
rate values and goals, and see how they pertain to your position. Ask your 
direct supervisor for further elaboration on these statements and on his 
or her priorities so you can make sure yours align yours accordingly.

The vital 20 percent: Figuring out where 
to focus your energy at work
Used effectively, the 80/20 rule can increase your on-the-job performance. 
From boardroom to lunchroom, executive suite to mailroom, this time-
management principle can help you accomplish the most important tasks in 
less time and help you advance in your career.
 
The 20-percent investment in the 80 percent of results remains relatively con-
stant. In more than a decade of working with business leaders to improve perfor-
mance, I’ve witnessed it firsthand: What’s truly important for success changes 
very little within a given profession. The two global objectives of any successful 
business are profit and customer retention. What differs among professions is 
how those global objectives translate to match individual objectives.
For example, here’s how the 80/20 rule factors into some major job categories:
 
 Ownership/executive leadership: As an executive or owner, your most 
important role is to establish the vision, goals, and benchmarks for the 
business. What are the core values and core purpose for the business? 
What are the goals for the year and then next quarter? What are the 
most pressing problems that need to be solved? What are the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the company or marketplace 
is experiencing? You then have to convey those answers consistently 
in clear terms for your lieutenants to follow and hold the lieutenants 
accountable to the standards.
 
 Sales: For sales professionals, lead generation leads to 80 percent of 
your return. Without new leads and new prospects to sell to, your 
customer and prospect base remains fixed to your current clients. So 
in sales, your most important tasks are prospecting and following up 
on leads; you should put a priority on securing and conducting sales 
appointments and building personal relationships.
 
 Don’t forget your existing client base as well. They usually follow the 
same 80/20 rule, where 20 percent of them contribute 80 percent of the 
revenue. Spend your time with this group to increase sales and referrals.
 
 Management: For those in leadership positions, your vital 20 percent 
is the coaching and development of people. You use coaching strate-
gies to encourage and empower your employees, and you monitor your 
staff’s adherence to the company’s strategic plans. In addition, you help 
your employees acquire the knowledge, skills, attitude, and actions to 
advance their careers.

50
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 Task- or service-based roles: This group of people varies the most 
because it’s the broadest. To identify your vital tasks, take a look at 
your company’s objectives, your department’s objectives, and your own 
objectives to get a well-rounded picture of how your role fits into the 
bigger picture. Then decide which of your job responsibilities increase 
sales or improve customer retentions.
 
 After that, consider the value of the product or service you offer, and 
weigh the importance of quality versus speed or quantity — your ulti-
mate goal is to serve your customers better so you retain and grow your 
relationships with them. (If you’re not sure how much weight each ele-
ment deserves, talk to your supervisor about where you should focus 
your efforts.)
 
• If quality takes higher priority, ask yourself how you can deliver a 
better product or service in the amount of time you’re given.
 
• If delivery speed or quantity is more important, ask yourself how 
you can deliver that product more efficiently while maintaining 
quality.
 
 Administration: If you’re in an administrative role, your goal is to 
enhance the company’s performance, whether you’re supporting front-
line sales staff or assisting the corporate leadership in steering the 
business toward profit. If you’re in sales support, how can you help 
free up the salespeople to do more selling? Can you fill out reports for 
the salespeople? Research new market opportunities and get contact 
information? Can you repeat that help for the sales manager in reports 
and better tracking of the salespeople’s numbers so the manager can do 
more coaching and shadowing of the salespeople?
 
 If you’re working in customer service, is there a recurring customer ser-
vice problem that needs to be solved? Can you identify it? Can you find 
at least two solutions to the problem and bring them to your boss for 
review? You can make yourself an indispensible asset to the company 
with these actions and save time for yourself and your superiors as well.
Personal essentials: Channeling 
efforts in your personal life
The 80/20 rule isn’t strictly business, so don’t lose sight of its influence on 
your personal life. In fact, the 80/20 rule can have the greatest impact at 
home. For most, personal and family life is the realm that matters most. But 
with all the demands of work and the outside world, it often takes the back 

51
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
seat. By categorizing and ordering your personal priorities, you can custom-
ize your approach to the people and priorities in your home life and make the 
most of your time spent with family, hobbies, leisure, and friends.
When factoring in your personal priorities, think of a variety of areas, such as 
time with loved ones, a worthy cause, your faith, education, and future plans. 
In this section, I cover the two areas of prioritization that affect most people 
(for other situations, follow the general process I outline earlier in “Matching 
time investment to return”).
Investing wisely in your personal relationships
One of the great things about the 80/20 rule is that it doesn’t apply only to 
task-oriented items — it’s also about the quality of your time and the energy 
you put into what you choose to do with it. If you have a significant other, for 
example, consider how 20 percent of all the time you spend with him or her 
shapes 80 percent of your relationship with that person.
Setting up family traditions
My wife, Joan, and I adhere to two traditions that 
don’t take much time but reap huge dividends in 
the closeness we feel with one another and the 
partnership in responsibilities that we share. 
The first is that Friday each week is date night. 
We have a standing babysitter, and even with 
my travel schedule, we rarely miss our Friday-
night date. In addition, we go away together — 
without kids — once per quarter. We usually 
take a two- to three-night trip so we can make 
up the connection time that often gets crowded 
out by parenting two active children.
My children and I also have a couple of long-
standing traditions to foster nurturing relation-
ships with each other. With my son, Wesley, I 
have Boy’s Breakfast Out at least two Friday 
mornings per month. We spend about 90 min-
utes talking and laughing, and then I take him 
to school. He looks forward to it, and so do I. 
Annabelle, at 2
1⁄2, loves to have tea parties, so I 
set aside time to sit among her stuffed animals 
and toys while she serves me tea in doll-sized 
cups. We don’t spend as long (fortunately — 
sitting in a low stool for longer than 45 minutes 
is murder on my back!) because her attention 
span is limited at her age. But she, too, eagerly 
anticipates tea time with Daddy.
Saturday morning means breakfast out with 
the whole family. It helps us all reconnect and 
strengthen our communication for the rest of 
the week. Sunday night is game night: We turn 
off the television and play board games as a 
family.
Your 20-percent time traditions may differ from 
ours, depending on the age, interests, and 
unique traits of your loved ones at home. The 
important thing is to find out what brings the 
biggest return, greatest connection, and best 
memories. Of course, I have to confess that 
applying the 80/20 rule in relationships is much 
easier to write about than to execute. Although 
you may understand how the 80/20 rule applies 
to your home relationships, putting it into prac-
tice remains a challenge. Work on this with 
each passing day.

52
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
Outside of work, personal relationships are number one, so always consider 
them first, before you even start thinking about chores. Evaluate your connec-
tion with each of the important people in your life, both family and friends. 
In this way, you can customize your approach to the people and priorities in 
your home life instead of lumping everything into the generalized category 
of “home” and perhaps not giving any individual or activity its due attention. 
When dealing with people, ask yourself these questions to help you identify 
the 80/20 balance:
 
 How can you invest your time with this person to create a better 
relationship?
 
 What’s most important to this loved one, and how can you serve and 
support these needs?
Many other questions can help get you to the root — or the 20 percent — of 
actions that produce a bumper crop of love, security, appreciation, and expe-
rience that build meaningful relationships at home. For example, if you’re 
raising children, you may ask yourself these questions as well:
 
 How can you invest your time to nurture this child’s developing interests?
 
 How can you show that you value this child in a way that he or she 
understands?
 
 What do you need to do each week to teach this child an important life skill? 
 
 What shared activities allow you to serve as a positive example?
 
 What can you do to create a positive family memory?
Balancing crucial household tasks with at-home hobbies
Face it: Your days are filled with tasks that really don’t bring much return on 
investment. Whether it’s doing the laundry or filling out paperwork, there are 
loads of those necessary-but-not-monumental duties that you’ll never be able 
to eliminate. And in your personal life, these activities may include house-
work, home maintenance, or walking the dog.
However, you can apply the 80/20 rule to help balance how you invest your 
time in chores so it aligns with your hobbies. Which activities bring you the 
biggest return? For example, do you spend every summer evening and week-
end on your back patio, entertaining or simply admiring your backyard and 
flower garden? Then for you, trimming, mowing, planting, and weeding may 
be a wise way to invest that vital 20 percent of your time. If, however, you get 
more enjoyment from traveling to new places, you may allocate that time to 
budgeting for and planning exciting vacations.

53
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
 
Cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry, yard work, bill paying, and other tasks 
are essential, but that doesn’t mean that you have to do them — sometimes, 
the added cost of hiring help is worth the time it frees in your schedule. If you 
gain no joy or fulfillment whatsoever in cleaning or household maintenance, or 
feel you simply don’t have the time or energy to do all this without sacrificing 
your most important priorities, hire out those responsibilities. Sure, there’s a 
cost involved, but you buy back time to spend on the activities that mean the 
most to you. So send out the laundry if it frees you up to explore new menus 
in the kitchen, or bring in a personal chef if you’d rather be out in the garden 
planting tomatoes.
If you can hire someone who makes far less money than you do to do some-
thing you don’t enjoy, hire out the task immediately. If you can work a few 
more hours and increase your pay or set yourself up for promotion sooner, 
then work the extra hours and hire the help. In the end, you’ll be doing some-
thing you enjoy rather than something you despise.
 
Yard maintenance will never be on my vital 20-percent time investment list. 
In my adolescent years, I mowed, clipped, trimmed, and hedged a lifetime’s 
worth of yards to earn money. I don’t own a lawnmower and never will. And 
frankly, a prizewinning lawn is not tops on my list of life satisfactions. However, 
I do enjoy presenting my family and friends with creative meals, so I put my 
time into grocery shopping and cooking. It gives me a chance to help lighten 
the load for Joan, and it offers another 20-percent time tradition with the kids. 
They love to get creative in the kitchen — especially baking cookies — so we 
do it together.
The 80/20 rule doesn’t stop there — you can also apply it to the quality of 
those tasks or hobbies and the results they have on your well-being. If you’re 
a gardener, for example, think about the 20 percent of your efforts that bring 
forth the 80 percent of your pleasure and satisfaction from gardening. For 
example, maybe you don’t need to sculpt a perfectly arranged flower garden 
to reap the personal benefits — the very act of digging your hands into the 
earth may give you the greatest sense of joy. So focus on the act of planting 
more than on the planning and shopping.
 
Don’t forget to include those activities that support and improve your physi-
cal, mental, and emotional health. Those activities that keep you sane, happy, 
and fit may seem insignificant when taken one at a time. But if they start get-
ting squeezed out of the schedule, you just may start to see that sanity, happi-
ness, and health start slipping. Be sure to account for all those little pleasures 
that add texture to your life — reading, study, yoga, your weekly facial.

Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Getting Down to Specifics: 
Daily Prioritization
After you identify the vital few tasks you need to accomplish to meet your top 
12 goals, break them down a bit further into daily to-do items. Then prioritize 
them to make sure you accomplish the most important tasks first, identifying 
which ones you must do on a given day. In that way, you progressively work 
through all the minor tasks that lead to the greater steps that, in time, lead you 
to achieving your goals. Here’s how:
 
1.  Start with a master list.
 
 Write down everything you need to accomplish today. Don’t try rank-
ing the items at this point. You merely want to brain dump all the to-do 
actions you can think of. You may end up with 20, 30, even 50 items on 
your list: tasks as mundane as checking e-mail and as critical as present-
ing a new product marketing plan to the executive board. Or if you want 
to fill work on your personal to-do list, the items may range from buying 
cat food to filing taxes before midnight.
 
 Remember to account for routine duties that don’t have a direct effect 
on your company’s mission or bottom line: turning in business expense 
reports, typing up and distributing meeting minutes, taking sales calls 
from prospective printing vendors. Neglecting to schedule the humdrum 
to-do items creates a destructive domino dynamic that can topple your 
well-intentioned time-block schedule.
 
2. Determine the A-list.
 
 Focusing on consequences creates an urgency factor so you can better 
use your time. Ask yourself, “What, if not done today, will lead to a 
significant consequence?” Designate these as A activities. If you have a 
scheduled presentation today, then that task definitely hits the A-list. 
Same goes for filing your tax return if the date is April 15. Buying cat 
food probably doesn’t make this list — unless you’re totally out or have 
a particularly vindictive cat.
 
3. Categorize the rest of the tasks.
 
 Now move on to B-level tasks, activities that may have a mildly negative 
consequence if not completed today. C tasks have no penalty if not com-
pleted today, followed by D tasks: D is for delegate. These are actions 
that someone else can take on. Finally, E items are tasks that could be 
eliminated, so don’t even bother writing an E next to them — just mark 
them out completely.

55
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
 
4.  Rank the tasks within each category.
 
 Say you’ve categorized your list into six A items, four B items, three C 
items, and two D items. Your six A tasks obviously move to the top of 
the list, but now you have to rank these six items in order: A-1, A-2, A-3, 
and so forth.
 
 If you have trouble ordering several top priorities, start with just two: 
Weigh them against each other — if you could complete only one task 
today, which of the two is most critical? Which of the two best serves 
your 80/20 rule? Then take the winner of that contest and compare it to 
the next A item, and so on. Then do the same for the B and C items.
 
 As for the D actions? Delegate them to someone else! Everyone likes to 
think they’re indispensable, but for most people, the majority of their duties 
could be handled by someone else. That’s where the 85/10/5 rule — first 
cousin to the 80/20 rule — comes into play: You tend to invest 85 percent 
of your time doing tasks that anyone else could do, and 10 percent of your 
time is devoted to actions that some people could handle. Just 5 percent 
of your energy goes to work that only you can accomplish. But whether at 
home or at work, this doesn’t mean you can kick back and leave 95 percent 
of your responsibilities to someone else. It simply helps you home in on the 
critical 5 percent, allocate your remaining time to other activities that bring 
you the greatest satisfaction, and recognize those tasks that are easiest to 
delegate.
 
Now you’re ready to tackle your to-do list, knowing that the most important 
tasks will be addressed first (see the nearby sidebar, “Rocking out: Putting the 
A-list tasks in place,” for the importance of prioritizing). Don’t expect to com-
plete as large a number of cross-offs as you may be used to. Because you’re 
now focused on more important items — which likely take more time — you 
may not get as many tasks completed. In my view, however, the measure of a 
great day is whether you wrap up all the A-list items. If you follow this system 
and consistently complete the As, I can assure you success. Why? Because the 
B and C items quickly work their way to As — and you always get the most 
important things done.
Don’t assume that you just move the Bs and Cs up the next day. You need 
to complete the whole process each day. Some of the Bs will move up, but 
others will stay in the B category. Some of the Cs — due to outside pressure, 
your boss, or changed deadlines — may leapfrog the Bs and become the 
highest priority As.

56
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Blocking Off Your Time and Plugging 
in Your To-Do Items
After you identify and order your priorities (see the preceding sections), you 
place them into time slots on your weekly calendar, broken into 15-minute 
segments — this process is commonly called time-blocking. I’ve discovered no 
better system for managing time on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and life-
long basis. I’ve seen miracle-level transformations in the lives of my clients — 
successes measured in income, health, relationships, personal growth, spiri-
tual transformation, and wisdom.
Like exercise, time-blocking can be tricky because it requires a lot of thought 
and adjustment, both in the initial stage where you’re doing it for the first 
time and for a while thereafter, when you’re developing the skill. Everybody 
knows what day two after the beginning of a new fitness program feels like: 
Stiff joints and sore muscles have you moving like the Tin Man after a rain-
storm. At first you may feel like you’ll never achieve the goals you’ve set, but 
sticking to the daily program eventually brings the results you want. Figuring 
out how to best manage your time depends on two things:
Rocking out: Putting the A-list tasks in place
Steven Covey and A. Roger Merrill illustrated 
the importance of prioritizing tasks in their 
book First Things First (Simon & Schuster) with 
a simple metaphor. In short, a guest lecturer 
was speaking to a group of students when he 
pulled out a 1-gallon, wide-mouthed Mason jar, 
set it on a table in front of him, and began fill-
ing it with about a dozen fist-sized rocks. When 
the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks 
would fit inside, he asked the class whether the 
jar was full, to which they unanimously replied, 
“Yes.”
He then reached under the table and pulled 
out a bucket of gravel, dumping some of it into 
the jar and shaking the jar, causing pieces of 
gravel to work themselves down into the spaces 
between the big rocks. He asked the group once 
more whether the jar was full, to which one sus-
picious student responded, “Probably not.”
Under the table he reached again, this time with-
drawing a bucket of sand. He started dumping 
in the sand, which sank into all the spaces left 
between the rocks and the gravel. Once more, 
he asked the question “Is the jar full?” “No!” 
the class shouted. “Good!” he said, grabbing a 
pitcher of water and pouring it in until the jar 
was filled to the brim.
He looked up at the class and asked, “What is 
the point of this illustration?” One eager beaver 
raised his hand and said, “The point is no matter 
how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, 
you can always fit some more things into it!”
“No,” the speaker replied. “The truth this illus-
tration teaches us is if you don’t put the big 
rocks in first, you’ll never get them in at all.”

57
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
 
 Consistent, diligent practice: If you want to build those time-blocking 
muscles, not only do you have to work them regularly, but you also 
need to increase the weight, stress, and pressure as you progress. 
Understanding the key to managing your minutes, hours, days, weeks, 
and so on takes repetition.
 
 I was first exposed to time-blocking at a business seminar more than 
20 years ago, and for the past 10 years, I’ve coached hundreds of thou-
sands of people. In all this time, I’ve yet to meet anyone — including 
myself — who doesn’t need some ongoing reinforcement, repetition, and 
refresher course of the time-blocking principles I share with you here.
 
 Don’t panic when you find yourself a little stressed or sore from all your 
time-blocking exercises. It’s simply a sign that your efforts to build up 
those skills are working.
 
 A span of time to improve: Achieving a level of time-blocking mastery 
does take time — a minimum of 18 months and as much as 24 months. 
Why so long? Because you’re developing a complex skill. A typical day 
has you switching from refereeing an argument between your kids to 
making an important presentation to the corporate executives; from put-
ting together your department’s annual budget to paying for your gro-
ceries in the checkout line. That’s a lot to orchestrate, and even Handel 
didn’t write his Messiah overnight. If you accept that time-blocking skills 
require time to develop, you’re more likely to remain motivated. Your 
objective is to make measureable progress in reasonable time.
Implementing time-blocking to help organize your schedule takes a bit of 
time, but you reap huge dividends on that initial investment. This section 
walks you through a general outline of the process I follow.
Step 1: Dividing your day
To start, you need a daily calendar divided into 15-minute increments. Why 
such small bites of time? Because even 15 minutes can represent a good 
chunk of productive activity. Losing just two or three of these small blocks 
each day can diminish your ability to meet your goals, from finishing that 
project at work to writing your bestselling (you hope) memoir. 
On that blank schedule, begin by dividing your day; draw a clear line between 
personal time and work time. When you take this step, you’re creating work-life 
balance from the start. Don’t take it for granted that Saturday and Sunday are 
time off just because you work a Monday-through-Friday work week. Block it 
into your schedule, or work activities may creep into your precious downtime. 
The more you take action on paper, the more concrete the time-block schedule 
becomes.

58
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
Apprehensive about drawing a line between work and personal time because 
you’re wary of having to tell a business associate you can’t attend a business 
function that extends into personal time? Not to worry. You don’t have to tell 
a client that your Tuesday-morning workout is more important than a break-
fast meeting with her — simply say you’re already booked at that time. That’s 
all the explanation you owe, and my experience shows that professional col-
leagues who want to do business with you respect your boundaries.
Step 2: Scheduling your personal activities
Blocking out personal activities first gives weight to these activities and 
ensures that they won’t be overtaken by obligations that have lesser impor-
tance in the long run. Personal obligations are almost always the first thing 
most people trade for work; because of that, I recommend that you hold fast 
and tight to the personal area so it doesn’t get away from you. Another advan-
tage? You help establish a reasonable end to your workday. If you’re sched-
uled to meet at a friend’s for Texas Hold ’Em on Thursday nights, you’re more 
motivated to wrap up your project in enough time to cut the deck.
Scheduling personal activities is twofold:
 
1. Schedule routine activities you participate in.
 
 Do you have dinner together as a family every night? A weekly date night 
with your significant other? Do you want to establish family traditions? 
Don’t just assume these activities will happen — give them the weight 
they deserve and block out the time for each one. Don’t forget to include 
your extracurricular activities here: All those PTA groups, fundraising 
committees, nonprofit boards, and other volunteer commitments get 
plugged in as well.
 
2. Schedule personal priorities that aren’t routine.
 
 Put those personal agenda items first before filling in your day with 
tasks and activities that don’t support those priorities.
Step 3: Factoring in your work activities
Begin with the activities that are a regular part of your job and then factor in 
the priorities that aren’t routine. Whether you’re a company CEO, a depart-
ment manager, a sales associate, an administrative assistant, or an entry-
level trainee, you’re responsible for performing key tasks and activities each 
day and week. They may include daily or weekly meetings. Or maybe your 

59
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
responsibility is scheduling meetings for others. You likely have to prepare 
for these appointments. Perhaps you have to write and turn in reports or 
sales figures on an ongoing basis. You may have to call someone for informa-
tion routinely. If you report to work daily and always spend the first hour of 
your day returning phone calls, time-block it into your schedule.
Step 4: Accounting for weekly 
self-evaluation and planning time 
Your goals — whether a one-year business plan or long-range retirement 
vision — warrant routine checkups. Consider them as rest stops on your 
journey: Are you still on the right road? Is a detour ahead? Have you discov-
ered a more direct route?
Use weekly strategic planning sessions — ideally for Friday afternoon or the end 
of the work week — to review your progress toward those near-future business 
projects as well as your larger career aspirations or personal goals. This is an 
opportunity to review the previous week and jump-start the upcoming week. I 
recommend spending 15 to 30 minutes daily and then taking a 90-to-120-minute 
session on self-evaluation and planning at the end of the week. 
Time-blocking: Making small 
investments in big success
Time-blocking doesn’t require a huge commit-
ment to produce results. A few years ago, one of 
my clients, a top sales performer in her region, 
exploded her sales by more than 125 percent in 
one year! I knew that time-blocking had played 
an important role in her success. I asked her 
what percentage of the time she had managed to 
adhere to her time-blocking schedule. She con-
fessed that she’d stuck to the schedule only 35 
percent of the time. The undeniable truth is that a 
little goes a long way. As you continue to use your 
time-blocking skills, that percentage increases, 
and your productivity grows accordingly.
I also have a client named Sam, a salesperson, 
who increased his contacts by ten per day after 
adopting time-blocking. These ten additional 
contacts led to an increase of five leads per 
week. He averages one appointment for every 
2.5 leads and has a 50-percent close ratio on 
appointments. So from ten contacts per day, 
he gains one extra sale a week. At an average 
$5,000 commission per sale, he has the poten-
tial to increase his income by $250,000 a year. 
How’s that for results?

60
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
This strategic planning time is probably your most valuable time investment each 
week. It gives you a tremendous wrap-up for the week and a good start to next 
week, and it reinforces your vision for your long-term success. It also enables you 
to go home and spend time with your family in the right frame of mind.
 
Years ago, I booked a weekly appointment with myself to analyze the num-
bers, sales ratios, and business activities in progress. I found the results of 
my performance as well as that of my staff improved dramatically. I’d wasted 
weeks and months as I agonized whether to include this activity into my 
schedule. My advice? Book an evaluation and planning session first and ask 
questions later.
Step 5: Building in flex time
Plug segments of time into your schedule every few hours to help you to min-
imize the fallout from unplanned interruptions or problems. About 15 or 30 
minutes is enough time to work in at strategic intervals throughout your day. 
Knowing that you have this free block of time can help you adhere to your 
schedule rather than get off track.
 
As you begin to build your time-blocking skills, insert 30-minute flex periods 
into your schedule for every two hours of time-blocked activity. This may 
seem like a lot of flex time, but if it allows you to maintain the rest of your 
time-block schedule and maintain or increase your productivity, it’s worth the 
investment. My experience is that the best time for flex time is after you’ve 
put in a couple of hours of your most important work — whether sales calls, 
report-preparation, or meeting a deadline.
 
Don’t schedule flex time right before you go into an important activity time: 
You’re more likely to get distracted and fail to get started with your critical 
business. Schedule it after the work — then you can use it, if necessary, to 
resolve any unforeseen problems.
Assessing Your Progress and Adjusting 
Your Plan as Needed
Becoming comfortable with time-blocking takes time, and achieving a glitch-
free schedule that you can work with for a stretch may take a half-dozen 
revisions. Even then, routinely evaluate your time-blocking efforts and adjust 

61
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
them periodically to make sure you’re getting the desired results. It’s not a 
huge time investment — you can check yourself with a few minutes a day or 
use 15 to 30 minutes of your weekly time to review your results. Ask yourself 
the following:
 
 What took you off track this week?
 
 What interruptions really affected your success with your time?
 
 Is someone sabotaging your time-block?
 
 What shifts would help your efficiency?
In this section, I discuss this review in detail.
Surveying your results
One way to determine your effectiveness at time-blocking is to check results. 
In as little as two weeks from when you launch your time-blocking schedule, 
you can probably see where you need minor adjustments. The best way to 
keep tabs on results is to track them on an ongoing basis. I suggest both a 
weekly review that focuses on the past week and a periodic review of where 
you stand in relation to your overall goals.
The weekly review is a time for you to replay the tape of the week, looking at 
the highs and lows. I guarantee you’ll have days where you want to pull your 
hair out because you face so many problems and distractions. You’ll also 
have days that are smooth as silk. What were the differences in those days 
besides the outcome?
As for the periodic review, review your job description, key responsibilities, 
and the ways in which your performance and success are measured. Then 
ask yourself these questions:
 
 Are you moving closer toward achieving your goals?
 
 Can you see measurable progress in reasonable time?
 
 Are you monitoring your performance well enough to see improvement? 
 
 What changes do you need to adopt now to increase your speed toward 
reaching the goal and reduce the overall amount of time you invest?
Your success in meeting your objectives tells you whether the time-blocking 
is working for you.

62
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Looking at measurable goals
If you can measure your goals in terms of numbers (dollars or sales, for 
example), then checking your results is a cinch. As a salesperson, for exam-
ple, you may follow your sales numbers or commissions results over several 
months in order to get a good understanding of the effectiveness of your 
time-blocking efforts. Or say you’re a magazine editor who’s evaluated on 
consistently meeting weekly publication deadlines; if your goal is to publish 
three articles per month in national magazines, you can assume that your 
time-blocking efforts require some tweaking if your review reveals that you’re 
getting only one story in print.
Evaluating qualitative goals
If your goals aren’t easily measured in terms of dollars or sales, you may 
need to get creative in developing your own tally for results. Family and per-
sonal goals are difficult to measure, but you can likely gain a good sense of 
how your efforts are tracking by just paying attention to your daily life and 
how you feel about it, rating your day on a 1-to-10 scale. Are your kids com-
fortable in talking and spending time with you? Do they look forward to being 
with you? Are you on friendly terms with the people in your community activ-
ities? Do you and your spouse laugh together more often than you argue?
You can also turn to other measuring sticks, which are especially useful in 
the workplace:
 
 What went well this week? What could you have done better?
 
 Did you accomplish what you really needed to do? How many high-pri-
ority items did you carry over to the next day or week? (See the earlier 
section titled “Getting Down to Specifics: Daily Prioritization” for more 
on prioritizing.)
 
 How would you rate your week on a 1-to-10 scale, with 1 being utterly 
overwhelmed and dissatisfied, and 10 being completely in control of and 
happy with how you spend your time?
 
 How do you feel you performed at work? How does your supervisor feel 
you’re performing?
 
 Did you meet your goals at home?
 
 Has what you’ve accomplished this week positioned you better to 
achieve your long-range goals?
 
 What are the key improvement areas for you next week?
 
 What adjustments to your long-range plans do you need to make?
 
 What’s diverting you from your schedule? 
 
 Were you unrealistic in your time estimates for tasks? 
 
 What segment of the day or activity is tipping your schedule off track? 

63
 Chapter 4: Focusing Your Efforts, Prioritizing Tasks, and Blocking Your Time
 
As you’re reviewing your results, be careful to do so with an open, obser-
vant mind, not a judgmental one. Give yourself a couple of weeks before 
you resolve to change your schedule. Doing so helps you get through a long 
enough period of time to account for anomalies.
Tweaking your system
Looking back at your personal behaviors and skills and the interruptions 
you routinely face, identify two or three steps you need to take in order to 
increase your success. Here are a couple of tips to point you in the right 
direction:
 
 If you’re not completing the most important tasks or working toward 
the most important efforts each day: Weed out some of the trivial tasks 
to make room for the most important ones. (I help you do that in the 
“Making a Daily To-Do List and Ordering Your Priorities” section, earlier 
in this chapter.)
 
 If your most productive times of day are filled with trivial tasks: Shift 
the tasks and the time slots you fit them in. (Your trouble is time-blocking, 
which I help you with in the earlier “Scheduling Your Time” section.)
After you figure out what you need to change, you can adjust your schedule 
accordingly. Unfortunately, I can’t give you a one-size-fits-all set of answers 
to help you figure out what to change — those decisions depend on your job 
requirements, your personal strengths and weaknesses, your personal goals 
and desires, and the amount of control you actually have over those aspects 
you’d like to improve. I can, however, help steer you in the right direction.
 
Remember the old adage “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot 
change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the dif-
ference”? You can apply it to the way you manage your time. If you can bal-
ance the results you expect to achieve (more productivity, greater efficiency, 
reduction in time worked, and greater sales) with the results you need to 
achieve, then you’ll be successful.
Following are some examples of quick evaluation questions that can help you 
make the most effective, results-oriented changes to your schedule:
 
 What’s the standard? Do you have a sales quota that needs to be met? 
Are you getting your boss’s priorities done? Going home, how are you 
feeling about your progress?
 
 How accurate does the time-block schedule need to be? In time-blocking, 
a little goes a long way. The real question is how well you did this week 
with the most important activities — the vital 20 percent of the 80/20 rule.

64
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 How much have you improved? How have you improved since you 
started working your time-block? How large is the improvement? Would 
you be happy if you improved each week for a year at this level?
 
 With additional revision, how much additional productivity would 
you gain? Before revising a time-block schedule, look at the anticipated 
return on investment. Is this change going to bring significant benefit in 
productivity, efficiency, or personal satisfaction?
 
 How good is good enough? Where is the point where you’ll achieve 
diminishing returns on your effort? At some point, further refining 
your schedule can lead to reduced results. Where do you think that’ll 
happen?
 
 Perfectionism is a scourge of people who are trying to achieve more 
with their time. The obsession with revising, redoing, and readjusting 
one’s time-block schedule every few days — or even hours — leads to 
frustration. In your time-blocking, clearly define the line of success so 
you can achieve your goals without going overboard.

I
 wish you could’ve heard my staff and my wife when I started writing this 
chapter. They howled. Okay, I admit it: What I share here is easier to write 
about than to do. Nonetheless, even if you’re not 100-percent successful with 
every one of the techniques, tools, and strategies in this chapter (I’m speak-
ing from experience here, folks), adopting even some of them can increase 
your productivity and vastly improve your overall time management.
One study I saw indicated that most people waste an hour per day trying to 
find papers lost on their desks (at least, that’s where they think the papers 
are lost). That’s not so bad, you say. But an hour per day adds up to 250 work 
hours per year, or more than 31 wasted days per worker annually.
Multiply that by the number of executives, professionals, and sales and 
administrative employees in this country, and you’re talking a significant 
loss of time. (And that doesn’t include hours spent at home trying to find 
misplaced eyeglasses, scissors, library books, keys, needle-nose pliers, cell-
phones, gym shorts, earrings, pacifiers, and so on.) Think how productive 
you’d be if you spent all that time, well, being productive!
If your work area is a parking lot for everything from C-level “someday” tasks 
to hotter-than-hot, this-project-can-make-my-career assignments, you’re the 
Titanic heading for an iceberg. Ask yourself the following:
 
 Do you know all the tasks you have to get done, complete with time lines?
 
 Do you have all the materials, documents, and tools you need right now to 
take each project to completion without putting out an all-points bulletin?

 In short, do you have everything you need to do an exceptional job in 
record time?
If you can answer all these questions with truthful and unequivocal yeses, 
you can skip this chapter. Everyone else, read on.
Streamlining Your Workspace
“Don’t touch my desk! I know exactly where everything is.” I’ve heard that 
line endlessly, and I’ve used it myself. If you’re like me, however, most of 
the time, as you stare at the forest of papers on your desk, you are clueless. 
You may have known where that phone number was yesterday, a few weeks 
ago, a month ago — or even a few minutes ago — but more stacks have since 
been added to the mix.
It’s not enough to know which chart, report, or snippet of paper is on which 
pile, whether it’s on the left or right side of your desk, or whether it’s stashed 
in the catch-all drawer of your filing cabinet. This is your career you’re talk-
ing about. Get a handle on it!
Make way! Clearing off your desk
 
Repeat after me: My desk is not a parking lot. My desk is not a parking lot. My 
desk is not a parking lot. If you want to get your desk under control, remem-
ber: Less is more. The more pictures, notes, boxes, tools (staplers, paper-clip 
holders, books), and so on that occupy your desk, the greater your odds of 
being distracted and the more cluttered your desk feels.
You also have less room to spread out if you’re consulting multiple sources 
of information, using a laptop in addition to your desktop computer, or 
studying oversized charts or graphs. What’s more, a topsy-turvy desk trans-
lates into greater stress and the misleading feeling that you have all the time 
in the world to complete your projects.
 
Remove everything that isn’t absolutely necessary from your desk. Be brutal. 
Here are some ideas to get you started:
 
 Move family photos to your credenza or bookcase, where you can still 
see them throughout the day (and remember why you’re working so 
hard) without their distracting you.
 
 If you have other pictures — perhaps of you with mentors or 
celebrities — hang them on the wall.
 
 Store extra tools, supplies, and items you use weekly in desk drawers 
and filing areas.

67
 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
 
 Don’t allow items you rarely use or haven’t looked at since slipping them 
into a pile to take up desk space. Put those items away in a filing cabinet, 
storage box, closet, or other less-accessible area.
As for your workspace, forget the Boy Scout be-prepared motto. It’s a recipe 
for desktop disaster, especially if you’re one who likes to prepare for flood, 
earthquake, alien invasion, and every other conceivable catastrophe. The 
cleaner and clearer your desk, the better you can use your time.
Assembling essential organizational tools
Having the right tools for the job is really the start of great organization. If 
you haven’t already done so, get all piles off your desk, even if you have to 
put them temporarily on the floor. Then gather these tools:
 
 A desk organizer: You need some way to keep the standard office fare — 
staplers, paper clips, pens, calculators — handy at your fingertips.
 
 Inboxes and outboxes: You need some type of organizational flow to 
your work that’s based on an in-and-out system. Too often, interruptions 
happen when someone drops off something you don’t need right now or 
stops by to pick something up. Setting up inboxes and outboxes outside 
the door of your office or cubicle keeps your desk clear and reduces 
chitchat.
 
 A quality filing cabinet with space for growth: You may be surprised 
at how much filing space you need if you’re a piler-turned-filer. I prefer 
lateral filing cabinets: They’re more costly but can save a lot of time 
because you can see all the files at once. (Ah! There’s that yellow folder 
for my volunteer project — and the blue one for my customer service 
committee.) If you prefer, use stacking, modular filing systems, such as 
those in many doctors’ and dentists’ offices.
 
 Colored file folders: Ban bland manila! I suggest using the rainbow of 
colored folders available today. Consider a color-coded filing system, 
such as a stoplight approach with green for new business and other 
money-generating items, red for problem issues or customers, and so 
on. I also find that colors jog my memory when it comes time to find 
the files.
 
 File folder labels: Labeling files is paramount to organization, efficiency, 
and time savings, even if you use colored folders. Labels can also be 
color-coded to further differentiate one file from another.

Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Setting up a timely filing system
Before you start going through papers, think about how you’re most likely 
to search for the documents you need. You can choose from numerous file-
labeling strategies, but here are some possible categories:
 
 Customers (alphabetically)
 
 Past clients you no longer serve
 
 Due dates and project timing
 
 Pending projects
 
 On-hold projects
 
 To-dos, miscellaneous, or a similar catch-all type of label
 
You can choose to file by subject, client name, importance, or a number of 
other ways, but if time is of the essence, setting up a tickler filing system may 
be ideal. Tickler or reminder files have been around for ages. They make sure 
you remember to deal with delayed or deferred items at the correct times. 
Here’s how they work:
 
1. Establish two complementary tickler files, one labeled monthly and 
the other labeled daily.
 
 Your monthly tickler can be as simple as a 12-slot expandable folder 
with the months written on each slot. Your daily tickler can be a 31-slot 
accordion file folder or even 31 hanging file folders, each labeled with 
dates 1 through 31.
 
2. As you receive new documents, place them in the appropriate slots of 
your monthly file.
 
 If a document you receive in December requires no action until March, 
place the document in the March slot of your monthly tickler file.
 
3. When you enter a new month, move documents from that month’s slot 
into the daily folders.
 
 When March rolls around, pull all the papers from your March tickler and 
place them in the appropriate days of the month in your daily tickler file.
This system is tremendous for both home and office. I use it to pay bills: 
I write our bills twice monthly and place them in my daily tickler file so I 
remember when they’re due and when to mail them (if a bill is due on July 25, 
for example, I write the check, put it in the envelope, add a stamp, and place 
the envelope in the July 15 slot to be sure I mail the bill well ahead of its due 
date). Best of all, I’ve invested minimum time.
Note: For many businesspeople, powerful software programs called customer 
relation management (CRMs) have replaced tickler files. Turn to Chapter 6 to 
find out more on CRM software and organizing computer files.

 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
 
If your filing skills are truly abysmal, have someone who’s a natural filer help 
you develop your filing system. I’m far more effective when I hand papers, 
reports, and memos off to an assistant. Whether a document is paper or elec-
tronic, I find I can also retrieve information more efficiently when someone 
else has filed it (because that person can help me find it!). Of course, only 
you can file some items (confidential personnel reports, salaries, information 
you want to keep personal, and the like). But as for the rest, use your team’s 
strengths and gifts so you can make better use of yours.
Tackling piles systematically
To de-clutter yourself, you need to remember this simple rule: Put the impor-
tant things where you can remember where they are and where you can get 
to them quickly. Here’s how the de-cluttering process breaks down:
 
1. Figure out what you can get rid of.
 
 Here are a few simple questions to ask yourself:
 
• Do you really need this? Really?
 
• Is there value in saving this item? (If the answer isn’t a definitive 
yes, toss it.)
 
• What happens if you don’t keep this?
 
• What’s the worst that could happen if you throw this away?
 
 Never throw away important documents, such as tax returns and busi-
ness receipts. The IRS requires you to retain tax records and all sup-
porting material for seven years. Before you toss, think carefully about 
whether an item has future value and whether copies are filed elsewhere 
so you can access them if you need to.
Going paperless
One way to clear your desk is to reduce the 
amount of paper you handle altogether by 
increasing your use of electronic files. In today’s 
technology world, you can scan most documents 
and create a digital version; many computers 
then allow you to apply optical character recog-
nition (OCR), which changes the scanned image 
into text that you can edit and search through. 
You can also have your faxed documents turned 
into digital documents that can be shared by all in 
your department and e-mailed to others.
Electronic versions are especially useful when 
you need to retrieve files. You can organize the 
digital or electronic files in multiple places at one 
time. For instance, you can keep a prospect’s 
information in a prospect file as well as in a file 
under the prospect’s name — it’s like being two 
places at the same time. You can also search for 
files or have your computer do the search while 
you’re working on something else — the only 
true multitasking one can do!

70
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
2. Condense the offending material into smaller piles by selecting items 
to go into a single master important pile.
 
 Many piles are simply files in disguise: documents that haven’t been put 
away where they belong. By collecting the most important items into a 
single pile, you get an idea of how much time you need to dissolve this 
pile into nothing.
 
 At first, you may not be able to do much more than create your master 
important pile. After all, you still have meetings to attend, e-mails to 
respond to, and work to finish. However, the master file ensures that 
you tackle the important stuff first; the smaller, less-important items 
have to wait.
 
3. Schedule an appointment with yourself in the next 48 hours to rid 
yourself of your master important pile.
 
 You don’t need to be in tip-top mental form to file. I suggest setting your 
filing appointment toward the end of the week, preferably in late after-
noon when your energy level is low. Friday afternoons are a good time 
to file with comparatively few interruptions. (If you’re struggling with 
interruptions, turn to Chapter 9 for help.) Don’t worry about your other 
piles yet. Using the filing system you chose (see the preceding section), 
focus on the most important pile until it disappears.
 
4. After making your master important file disappear, go back to your 
remaining clutter and repeat the process.
 
 Start a second most-important master file and move all most-important 
items into that pile; then file them. Then make a third most-important 
master file. By now, you can probably see the surface of your desk, and 
you may even have a substantial area cleared.
Keeping Clutter from Coming Back
Not so long ago, a handshake or verbal agreement sealed the deal. No more. 
Today, you need paper to confirm an agreement, assure mutual understand-
ing, and even organize tasks. Paper has taken over people’s lives.
Whether you’re at home or at the office, maximizing your time means that all 
paper has to quickly find its way to the proper place, even if that place is the 
recycle bin or shredder. The key to controlling paper before it controls you is 
to decide quickly where to put it (for tips on making decisions, see Chapter 11).
The best strategy for maintaining a clutter-free workspace is to avoid creat-
ing piles in the first place. You need to be more strategic in your work time to 
circumvent pile explosion. This section gives you two quick starts to circum-
vent the explosive growth of piles on your desk (or credenza, bookshelves, 
filing cabinets, extra chairs, window ledges, floor, or any other flat surface).

 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
Handling papers once
Those who master paper have mastered single-handling. These people touch 
a paper and take action. They don’t pile, table, ponder, check, reconsider, or 
delay. They get rid of the paper the first time they handle it.
If you want to become a single handler, follow the five Ds: dump, delegate, 
detour, do it, or depot. Otherwise, you confront a less-productive list of 
Ds: dawdle, daydream, deliberate, and deceive — all of which lead to your 
demise.
Dump it
The dump-it principle is simple: Do you need it? If you don’t, dump it or dis-
pose of it. Say no to any of the following questions, and you can feel comfort-
able sending it to the shredder or recycling bin:
 
 Do you really need to act on this or keep it?
 
 Is this new, relevant information you need now or in the future?
 
 Does this information benefit a colleague or client?
 
 Are there consequences for not keeping it?
 
 Will this increase revenue or customer service?
 
Sort your mail over the recycling bin or waste basket. Everything that swirls 
into the bin or basket is no longer your problem.
Letting the mess get away from me
When I was a kid, my bedroom was a mess. My 
parents asked me to clean it, and I did; but like 
Pigpen in the Peanuts comic strip, I seemed to 
carry my mess with me everywhere I went, and 
my bedroom started re-accumulating clutter the 
minute I entered. Mere hours after I’d tidied it, it 
was a disaster again. In fact, my bedroom once 
led my father to believe we’d been burglarized: 
Seeing my room in complete disarray, he ran to 
his and my mother’s bedroom to see what the 
thieves had taken! I’ve since left most clutter 
behind, but like mushrooms after rain, it creeps 
back when I’m not paying attention. I now lead 
a (mostly) well-organized, efficient life, and so 
can you.

72
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Delegate it
Do you have an inner pack rat that wants to hold onto everything, including 
every paper that crosses your desk? One way to shut down this impulse is to 
delegate papers to someone else. Even if you know you could complete the 
task with two hands tied behind your back, that doesn’t mean it’s the best 
use of your time. Delegate and give yourself more time to work on high-value 
tasks while building the skills and confidence of people you delegate to.
Detour it
Handling every sheet of paper once is a fantastic goal, but sometimes it’s 
impossible. Maybe you need more information before you can delegate or 
dispose of a paper, or perhaps the paper raises significant questions that 
need to be answered before you act. If you can detour and park the paper for 
later follow-up, you’ve saved time deliberating now.
 
Don’t park paper permanently! Create a detour file for delayed papers, but be 
sure you get the information you need and deal with the paper. Don’t let your 
temporary file grow into a pile hidden in a file.
Do it
Do it is the easiest and most straightforward of all the Ds. Take action, either 
to get the task done quickly or because there’s a high level of urgency associ-
ated with it:
 
 Tend to urgent matters. If the task moves to the top of your priorities 
list after you read the paper, the best course of action is to do it now. 
Change your priorities and work until the new priority is completed, 
even if it takes you the rest of the day.
 
 Get the task done quickly. Follow the five-minute rule: If the necessary 
task, phone call, response, or clarification is something only you can 
do, and it’ll take fewer than five minutes, do it yourself right now. By the 
time you detour it, pick it up again later, reread it, and refocus, you’ll 
have invested far more time than the five minutes required now.
Depot it
A depot is a place where something is deposited or stored. You can find 
essential tools for filing earlier in this chapter in “Streamlining Your 
Workspace,” so you can establish an effective depot for papers you need to 
keep (and only the papers you need to keep).

73
 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
Filing regularly
Because the task of filing is mundane, it’s all too easy to allow other tasks, 
people, and priorities to creep into the time you set aside to deal with your 
piles and files, and in a few short weeks, the weeds can take over your garden 
again. Don’t let that happen! Daily filing may not be necessary, but waiting 
a month or six weeks is too long. Make your time spent filing a priority. At 
the end of filing, your desk is devoid of piles, and you can begin filing once a 
week — for a much shorter time — and still keep on top of your paperwork. 
Keep up with your filing, and you won’t find it so tedious.
 
Schedule a weekly filing appointment with yourself and put it on your calen-
dar. As you look ahead to assess your week and see your filing appointment, 
you begin mentally preparing for it. When you’re prepared, you’re more likely 
to keep your appointment with yourself, and when the time arrives, you’ll 
be more efficient. You may find yourself throwing away more marginal items 
throughout the week and completing the task in less time.
When you’re facing a few hours of filing, set a goal or benchmark. If you can’t 
complete the whole project, break it down into a portion you can complete 
and commit to finishing that part without fail. (For more information on com-
pleting projects by chunking, see Chapter 10. Look for my Swiss-cheese or 
salami-slice methods.)
Taking notes that you can track
In business, most people overlook the simple skill of note-taking as a time-
saving tool. Most people think anyone with a pen and paper can take notes: 
After all, everyone learned how in junior high, right? And if you’re like most 
people, you probably take notes on whatever’s handy: sticky notes, slips of 
paper, cocktail napkins, envelopes, or even important documents. Wrong 
approach! You can face significant time-loss and embarrassment when you 
later find out you lost the slip of paper where you took notes.
Whether you’re using specially designed and cut pads printed with “from the 
desk of,” a full 8
1⁄2-x-11-inch pad that’s a color other than the standard white 
or yellow, or a smaller white or yellow notepad, you need to use something 
that stands out.
If you know you’ll need to file the notes, make sure you go with large paper 
so you can find it later. When you finish writing, add action items to your pri-
ority list for the following day and then drop the notes into the appropriate 
file for record-keeping. If your action items make it to the A level during the 
next day’s priority sort, all you have to do is pull out the file folder and find 
your notes there as you left them, safe and sound.

74
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
Although sticky notes are great for attaching quick reminders to your com-
puter screen so you don’t forget to buy ice cream and pickles for your preg-
nant wife, they’re one of the worst places to jot down information. Here’s why:
 
 They’re too small for extensive notes. You run out of room and have 
to transfer information to a larger note pad or, worse, to a second (and 
possibly third) sticky note. Then you have a sticky note stuck to a sticky 
note stuck to a sticky note, and if you lose one, you lose them all.
 
 Sticky notes tend to sprout legs, sticking where you don’t want them 
to: to the wrong document headed to the wrong file. Then you’re on a 
frantic mission to find your all-important sticky notes (and when they’ve 
hitched a ride on an unknown document going who-knows-where, your 
chances of finding them are slim to none).
 
 Aged sticky notes lose their stick over time. More than once, I’ve lost 
important information because my sticky note came unstuck and flut-
tered into oblivion.
 
If you’re not sharing a document with others, consider taking notes directly on 
the document rather than on a sticky note. You can take notes in the margins 
around the key issues in the document or use the white space at the beginning 
or end for summaries or more-general points.
Limiting the Paper You Receive
Many people receive more material via snail mail and e-mail in one day than 
they can read in year. No one wants to miss news or seem out of it, but few 
people have time to read, let alone organize, the printed gridlock paralyzing 
their inboxes and mailboxes.
The question isn’t how to handle the information, because you can’t. All you 
can do is decide what’s important and try to limit what you receive. You may 
have an information-overload problem if you
 
 Have stacks of periodicals around that you intend to read but never do.
 
 Buy books that sound good, only to get home and find that they’re 
already on your shelf.
 
 Get frustrated because you haven’t read your weekly news magazine in 
six months.
 
Here’s how to cut down on the paper overload:

75
 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
 
 Cancel subscriptions that you don’t read regularly. Don’t immediately 
renew subscriptions to magazines you read infrequently — take a break 
for a couple of months and see whether you really need them or miss 
receiving them. I can assure you that the publishers are eager to have you 
back and may make you a sweeter deal than if you were a regular renewal.
 
 Move to Internet-based subscriptions. Most quality publications now 
offer Internet-based subscriptions. They save time because you can 
search issues by topic and you can read only the articles that interest 
you. You can also search topics by date.
 
 Get off mailing lists. If you’re like me, unsolicited correspondence easily 
makes up 60 to 80 percent of your daily incoming mail. If you’re on one 
mailing list, your name is bought, sold, and bartered to numerous others 
before you can say “spring catalog.”
 
 Most reputable firms belong to the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). 
Write the DMA (Mail Preference Services, P.O. Box 643, Carmel, NY 
10512) or visit online at www.dmaconsumers.org and ask the DMA to 
remove your name from its lists.
 
 Take a sabbatical from the news. The news can be negative, biased, and 
sensationalized to attract an audience. Don’t let that be you. If you’re 
interested in a topic, research it in depth (remember books?). You may 
find that your news sabbatical turns into a permanent vacation. (If you do 
need a news fix, look for the online version of your newspaper of choice.)
 
 Create a tear file of all the articles or papers you do want to read. I’ve 
been using a tear file for almost 20 years, and it’s saved me countless hours. 
A tear file helps you decide quickly what’s worth your time and what isn’t.
 
 It’s simple: Tear out articles you want to read from trade publications, 
magazines, newspapers, and so on and file them in your tear file. Throw the 
rest of the publication into the recycle bin. Carry your tear file with you all 
the time, so whenever you’re waiting — in traffic, at the doctor’s office, at 
the car repair shop — you use your time productively. If the same article 
remains unread in your tear file for more than a couple months, pitch it.
Accounting for Ergonomics 
and Aesthetics
Not all time-saving techniques pertaining to your workspace are directly 
related to organization; elements such as comfort and positive energy also 
affect your productivity. Two of the most important and often overlooked 
areas are ergonomics (a fancy term for fitting the job tools to the worker, 
rather than vice-versa) and aesthetics (how you decorate your space to make 
the place where you spend your time enjoyable and uplifting).

76
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
An ergonomic workspace increases your productivity, reduces your work 
hours, and prevents workplace injuries by placing your body at optimal angles 
and at distances where productivity increases and fatigue decreases. (Many 
work-related injuries can be traced to poor posture, poor work practices, and 
badly designed office chairs, desks, workstations, and computer keyboards.)
Likewise, aesthetics plays an important part in time management because it 
encourages you to be more productive. By surrounding yourself with things 
that inspire you, you help yourself keep all things in perspective, particularly 
the balance between your work and personal life so you can make better 
decisions and — on those days you feel like you’re drowning — remember 
why you’re doing what you do.
 
As I tell my wife, Joan, when she chooses her shoes based on style 
rather than comfort, ergonomics plays second fiddle to aesthetics all 
too often. If we’re going to walk around town for an afternoon, and Joan 
wears her fashionable (and very attractive) slides rather than her walk-
ing or athletic shoes, I know that sooner or later, she’s going to pay for 
her choice. The same is true in your workplace — so tend to your needs 
before making adjustments that are helpful but not crucial.
Setting up a proper workstation
Although today’s desks are more likely to be designed to accommodate PCs, 
many desks are still manufactured first and foremost for writing, note-taking, 
phone conversations, and getting organized.
The standard desk is a couple of inches too high for comfortable computer 
use, so if you spend a considerable amount— say, 50 percent — of your time 
on the computer, a keyboard at desk height can lead to problems with your 
back, shoulders, and neck. You probably know someone who’s had carpal 
tunnel syndrome — numbness, tingling, and pain — in his or her wrists 
because of repetitive and incorrect computer use. That’s only one ailment 
resulting from non-ergonomic work stations.
 
You probably spend the bulk of your office time sitting. To avoid fatigue 
and injury, invest in a good, ergonomically sound chair. Features to look for 
include the following:
 
 Adjustable height and tilt
 
 Adjustable back rests for your lower back
 
 A rotating seat
 
 At least five wheels
Be sure you align your keyboard and monitor, too, instead of letting pieces 
jut left or right.

77
 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
Decorating your space
Productive people create workspaces where they enjoy spending time. You 
spend many hours working, so make your work environment a place where 
you can focus and be productive for long stretches. You may have a strictly 
utilitarian view of your work area (it’s Spartan but functional — what more 
do you need?). Or it may be important to you to dress up your space a bit. 
Whatever your preferences, keep them in mind as you begin planning your 
work area. Consider the following aspects of your workspace:
 
 Walls: Do you work better if your walls are a softer, more comfortable 
color than the harsh white of most offices? Consider painting or hanging 
wallpaper or swatches of fabric.
 
 Images: Are pictures, art, and photographs important in your 
surroundings?
 
 Floor: Should you buy a rug to add color and form or give your office a 
warmer feel?
 
 Lighting: What’s the lighting like? Most people work beneath the low 
hum of fluorescent lighting. To give your area a warmer feel, you may 
try a desk lamp or even a lamp on your credenza behind you to create 
better ambience.
 
 Furniture: Do you need to upgrade your office furniture? If it’s okay with 
your boss, can you add a couch for afternoon cat naps or creative brain-
storming? Do you need a small table for meetings with your team?
 
Here are a few points to remember as you personalize your space:
 
 Limit the items on your desk to the more utilitarian variety. Remember: 
The top of your desk is not a decoration zone. Use the walls, floor, and 
credenza to bring the environmental influence in your workspace.
 
 Pay attention to placement. If you’re someone who dreams about better 
times as you toil away, right behind your desk may not be the best place 
for a large photo of your last trip to Hawaii. Instead, you may consider 
putting it on your credenza so you can look at it during a moment of 
relaxation and envision what you’re doing all the hard work for.
 
 Be careful not to add anything that’ll add to the responsibilities you 
have to tend to each day. After all, the point is to increase your produc-
tivity, not give you more to do. Consider this scenario, which I advise 
against in your own space: I once worked with a woman who had fish 
swimming in a tank on her credenza. Although her mini-aquarium was 
beautiful and soothing and drew plenty of attention, I often wondered 
how much work time she spent cleaning it — and how she persuaded 
her co-workers to feed her fish when she went on vacation!

Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Maintaining a Productive Environment 
in the Home Office
With gas prices skyrocketing and technology booming, the number of people 
working from home continues to grow. You can cash in on big savings in both 
time and money if you work from home. Here’s how:
 
 You can redirect the daily time you used to spend commuting into work, 
exercise, and family.
 
 Flexible hours give you almost total control over your work schedule. If 
you need to get up early or stay up until midnight to meet a deadline, it’s 
doable, and you’re minutes from bed.
 
 You spend less on lunches, dinners, and snacks, not to mention what 
you save on departmental gifts for holidays, parties, and other special 
occasions.
 
 You chalk up lower costs for clothing.
 
 Transportation expenses such as gas, car maintenance, tolls, parking, 
and train or bus fare drop.
On the other hand, beware of perceptions and misperceptions that can cause 
your productivity at home to fizzle. In this section, I explain how to set up 
your office away from the office.
Creating an environment 
that fosters solid focus
When choosing a location for your home office, you want a place that affects 
your productivity and your ability to manage your time in a positive way. When 
the space is less than ideal, or when you struggle to focus on work even when 
your location is ideal, consider trying these tips to nurture your productivity:
 
 Choose an out-of-the-way locale. Look for an area that’s yours alone, 
removed from general traffic and noise, where you can shut the door 
and hang a do-not-disturb sign on the knob. The more out of the way 
your office is, the better use you’ll make of your time.
 
 Setting up your home office in Hub Central — the family center of your 
home — without physical boundaries is unwise. Today’s typical den 
off the entry doesn’t provide enough physical distance. It is right in the 
middle of the home, so noise from both ends of the house reaches you 
clearly. Your family walks by numerous times, and in newer homes, the 
office doors are often glass, providing no visual barrier whatsoever.

79
 Chapter 5: Setting Up and Maintaining a Productive Workspace
 
 I once had an office that was nearly ideal. It was above our detached 
garage, which created a short commute of 47 steps from our side door 
up the steps and into the office. Believe it or not, those scant 47 steps 
substantially decreased the number of interruptions.
 
 Employ other physical barriers if your office location isn’t ideal. If 
your home office isn’t off in a private area of the house and your doors 
are glass, your best defense is a shade or visual barrier. When children 
see you “not working” (that is, thinking), they may figure it is playtime. 
The other necessary item is a lock on the door, which announces that 
you’re busy and uninterruptible.
 
 Use white noise to block out other household noises. You can establish 
auditory boundaries by blocking household noises with white noise. 
White noise is a constant low-level background sound, such as static or 
a whirring fan, which quickly becomes inaudible but drowns out other, 
more disruptive noises.
 
 Drown out distracting noise with music. The best background music for 
me is Baroque piano. It’s simple because it’s only one instrument; also, 
studies have shown that Baroque music stimulates the creative side of the 
brain. I advise against the radio because of the constantly changing style 
and tempo of songs, the newscasts, and disk-jockey monologues (though 
some people claim to work better with this sort of background noise). I 
also suggest instrumental music rather than songs with lyrics — words 
can be distracting. I listen to orchestra and symphonic music, such as 
classical or easy listening.
Establishing boundaries and getting 
yourself in the work mindset
 
I can’t emphasize enough how crafting and adhering to a set of rules for you as 
well as your entire family and friends increases your chance of success when 
you’re working at home. By drawing lines between your work time and your 
personal time, you allow yourself to be fully present with each — and pres-
ence is a key component of productivity. To establish a solid set of boundaries 
for yourself, follow these suggestions:
 
 Treat a day at the home as you would a day in your office. Start your 
day the same time you’d begin your commute to home-away-from-home 
and end it at the same you’d end your work day. Take only a half-hour 
lunch (but be sure to take that half-hour lunch). Regular start and stop 
times and set lunch breaks allow everyone to recognize your schedule 
and abide by it.
 
 Start early. If you work at home, you may find, as most office workers 
have, that you’re most productive before others arrive. In the home 
office world, that’s before your household wakes up for the day.

80
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 Dress for success. Because you don’t have to shower, shave, and don office 
clothes, you lose the empowering feeling you get that makes work seem like 
work. If you need formal dress to perform better and are negatively affected 
by staying in sweats or pajamas most of the day, by all means, get up, 
shower, and get dressed, just as you would if you were heading to the office. 
If you feel successful, you’ll be successful, regardless of where you work.
 
 Set goals for yourself. Set goals in terms of work completed and reward 
yourself for achieving them, just as you would at the office.
 
 Don’t answer personal calls during your workday. Using a home office 
to increase your productivity is an act of discipline. Others sometimes 
adopt the attitude that you’re not really working; people who wouldn’t 
imagine interrupting you at the office call to chew the fat, simply 
because you’re home. Parents are often guilty of this. Be polite but firm: 
“Mom, I’m sorry. I’d love to talk, but I’m working right now. I’ll call you 
back at five, as soon as I’m finished, okay?”
 
 Control interruptions from your family members. Patiently train your 
family on your work schedule and etiquette. You may want to establish 
set times when you allow for interruptions.
 
 Setting these boundaries can be challenging, especially with the pre-
school set. When we were blessed with children, I decided that my work 
time would be “interruptible” when it came to our kids, and I stand by 
that philosophy. (I have to say, however, that both Annabelle and Wesley 
have uncanny abilities for selecting the worst possible times to inter-
rupt!) Here’s the one exception I make to the come-on-in rule: Absolutely 
no interruptions when I’m on the phone. You, too, may want to set some 
inviolable rules. Make them few, but enforce them rigorously.
 
 Bartering can empower both you and your family. For example, while 
trying to finish a chapter a few days ago, I offered Wesley a trade: No 
more interruptions for the rest of the morning in return for an hour 
of fishing together. He let me complete the chapter (which took me at 
least an hour less to finish than it would’ve otherwise). Then I quit a 
little early, and we had our fishing contest in the golf course pond in 
our backyard. I lost one to four, but in spite of that, I managed to get my 
work done — and have a winning afternoon with my son!
 
 End on time. Being available to work extended hours can diminish the 
quality and quantity of family time. Set boundaries. When the office door 
closes, let voice mail pick up work calls. Leave the office behind.
 
 Allow yourself uninterrupted time each day to compress. A commute 
allows you time to shift gears. On your way home, you move from CEO, 
salesperson, manager, assistant, or customer service representative to 
Daddy, Mommy, husband, wife, partner, or Fido’s master. When you exit 
the door of your home office, the shift is over, and you’re on! So when 
you’re done for the day, take ten minutes to decompress before you 
walk out the door. You may even play some relaxing music so you can 
leave the troubles of the day behind.

P
icture this: I’m getting ready to go on vacation, when a critical client 
asks me to make a sales presentation to one of the largest sales net-
works in the country. For a moment, I panic — the event is scheduled imme-
diately after my return from my vacation. If I’m to be prepared, I’ll have to 
disappoint my family and cancel our getaway. Ah, but then I remember — I 
have a similar version of that presentation wrapped up on a PowerPoint 
program. A few tweaks and some minor revisions, and I’ll have a new and 
customized presentation in a couple of hours. I put in some research time, 
modify my PowerPoint, and head out for a week of fun and sun.
I’m a prisoner of technology, and I’m delighted. I love what technology does 
for me and for my business, Sales Champions. The computer is the lifeblood 
of my organization, from communication and data storage to organizing proj-
ects to dealing with clients, suppliers, and prospects. It must be love, or I’d 
never tolerate the terrible, awful fits technology occasionally gives me.
In this chapter, you discover what the love affair is all about. I point out the 
efficiency provided by electronic scheduling and using a personal digital 
assistant (PDA). I help you eliminate excess baggage on your computer, orga-
nize and name the files you save so you can access them quickly, and archive 
files you may need to refer to in the future in a way that minimizes the time 
you spend searching for them. I also show you how a customer relationship 
management (CRM) program can help you organize your client information 
and increase business. Read on.

Plugging into Electronic Scheduling
Electronic tools can help keep your time and schedule under control. A qual-
ity PDA, for example, acts as your electronic assistant on the road or in your 
office. It’s an easily writable, very compact computer that takes only seconds, 
not minutes, to boot. This section outlines your options for electronic plan-
ners, whether you’re looking to use calendar software on a desktop computer 
or to pull out your smartphone when you’re on the go. I also discuss the pros 
and cons of PDAs and considerations to keep in mind before deciding which 
one to use.
The calendar-sharing benefits 
of electronic scheduling tools
One of the biggest benefits of using electronic scheduling tools is that you 
and your co-workers have access to each others’ schedules without making a 
phone call or pestering administrative assistants. This slashes the time you 
need to set up a meeting because the software also informs you where others 
are, what they’re doing, and when they’re available. Electronic scheduling 
saves time on the recipient’s end, too — because others can see your sched-
ule, you receive meeting invitations only at times you’re available and you 
don’t have to consult your schedule to see whether you can attend.
Say, for example, you’ve been trying to reach Bob Smith for two days. Every 
time you call him, he’s in a meeting, and every time he calls you back, you’re 
out in the field. You cut through the time-wasting telephone tag, check into 
your network scheduling system, and schedule a time for both you and Bob 
to talk. You can see that he’s in the office but free of meetings between 2 
and 3 p.m.
Scheduling systems, such as Microsoft Outlook, are great for setting up meet-
ings for the convenience of the majority. For example, suppose you need to 
set a meeting next week for the ten people on your budget task force: Your 
attendance, as well as those of three department heads, is required. By using 
Outlook to schedule the meeting, you can see others’ schedules before you 
even send a meeting invitation. You can search through the week to find the 
best time for the most people, ensuring your numbers and the attendance of 
those critical to the meeting.
And when you’re not available? Don’t worry: No one knows that you’re actu-
ally getting a haircut at 3 p.m. Thursday — they just know you’re not avail-
able to meet.

The utility of portable planners
Portable planners have an incredibly wide variety of uses. When traveling via 
air, I frequently see executives turn their handhelds to airplane mode as soon 
as the chime signals that the plane has risen above 10,000 feet, and many 
barely slow down until the chime sounds a few hours later on descent. When 
the plane lands, they fire up their PDAs, and all their hard work goes out via 
e-mail before the plane is parked at the gate.
A PDA allows you to carry your calendar — and every one of your client and 
prospect contacts — in one hand. You can even put your time-block sched-
ule, which shows what you’re doing at each moment of each day and keeps 
you on track, into your electronic planner (see Chapter 4 for in-depth guid-
ance on that crucial time-management tool). In most programs, you can copy 
your time-block for years into the future with a few keystrokes. And when you 
want to share your schedule with others, you can quickly and easily upload it 
to your computer network.
A PDA also serves as your multimedia center: It can function as an MP3 
player, portable flash drive, electronic photo album, or video player. You 
have instant Internet access for stock quotes, news, sports, and so on.
The last ten years have brought an explosion of options in this area: You can 
choose from Palm handhelds, Palm Treo smartphones, Apple iPhones, and 
BlackBerries (not to mention numerous other “berries”). Your cellphone car-
rier may influence which make and model you select because the make and 
model can affect coverage, service, and reception.
 
Most PDA companies partner with cellphone companies, so when you get 
your first PDA or upgrade an existing one, keep an eye on what your cellular 
provider recommends as well as any specials the company may be running.
Where you use your PDA influences your choice as well. Many PDAs offer global 
coverage. You can use BlackBerries, for example, in more than 90 countries, so 
when you land in Hong Kong, London, Sydney, or Los Angeles, you can send and 
receive e-mail. However, if you travel nationally or internationally, some PDAs 
are more effective than others. I was in Australia a few weeks ago, and another 
U.S. speaker at the conference couldn’t get his PDA to work Down Under.
 
Beware: Some PDAs don’t work with some brands of CRM software (see the later 
section “Managing Contact Info with a CRM Program”). Be sure to check whether 
your PDA is compatible with your CRM before investing in either. Also check 
whether you can sync from remote locations or whether you need to physically 
be in your office to sync. In addition, some PDAs, as well as some CRM soft-
ware, won’t sync if you’re connected remotely. This means e-mail you send and 
receive, calls you make, notes from those calls, and appointments booked by 
your staff won’t show up in your PDA — or in the server containing your CRM — 
resulting in missed appointments, duplications, wasted time, and lost revenue.

84
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Despite all their benefits, PDAs do have drawbacks: You get married to the 
technology; you can be too accessible; if you lose the PDA, it’s as if you lost 
your whole life and database. Although most of the world has embraced the 
PDA revolution, at times you may want to be less accessible.
 
When deciding whether a PDA will save or cost you time overall, consider 
your job and the level of concentration that you need to perform well. Do you 
really need to be accessible at a moment’s notice? Are you the type of person 
who can put it off or down? Do you answer all the phone calls that come to 
your home? If you’re unable to screen calls at home, you may have a hard time 
screening your PDA.
De-cluttering Your Computer 
(and Keeping It That Way)
Is your computer a junk drawer, collecting everything you don’t have time 
to deal with? Your computer has limited space, and sooner or later, you’ll be 
forced to clean it or find another drawer (and computers are far more expen-
sive than drawers!). The more junk on your computer, the harder it is to find 
what you’re looking for. And just as an overflowing drawer gets harder to 
open and close, an overstuffed computer also works less efficiently.
The best way to tackle an overburdened computer is to sort its inventory 
and then purge what you can from it, whether you back files up to a disc and 
delete them from your computer or simply delete them once and for all.
Naming files and organizing 
them with an electronic tree
Start by creating categories for your electronic files, with one folder for each of 
your major areas of responsibility. Typical categories include sales, marketing, 
human resources, promotion, and current projects, as well as categories based on 
your products and services. You may also include folders for key customers. 
Again, just as you create subfolders under these headings in your file cabinets, 
create electronic subfolders for smaller, more specific categories.
 
Build your filing tree — an outline of major folders and the subfolders to go 
beneath them — in your computer before you begin to file individual docu-
ments. Don’t start filing and then try to organize your files. It’s difficult to see 
all your files at once on a computer, so that strategy rarely works. Having at 
least a rough outline of the files and folders on your PC, and perhaps even 
on paper, before you begin eliminates a lot of copying, cutting, and pasting. 
Result: greater efficiency and significantly less frustration.

85
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
The most challenging part of organizing, whether physical or electronic, is 
developing a system. The key to being able to retrieve information without 
wasting time is to file it correctly in the first place. The following subsections 
present some questions to help you devise a system that works for you.
How do you usually need to access information?
Do you need to retrieve information by date? Subject matter? Company? 
Project name? Everyone has different priorities based on the type of busi-
ness, job description within that business, and personal preferences. If you’re 
the keeper or primary resource of spreadsheets, reports, correspondence, or 
contracts, you may have to be able to pull up files quickly for others or com-
municate or share this information. In that case, you may need to tailor your 
filing system to what works best for someone else. Think about how your 
boss or colleague asks you for a document. Does he usually remember the 
name of the contact he was working with, the location he travelled to, or the 
time of year that he was working on the project?
If your projects are very large, break them into smaller, more easily accessed 
files. Here are a couple of basic breakdowns for your filing system:
 
 If you do the same set of projects for several different clients, you may 
want to file under client names. If you’re going to file by name, decide 
whether to file by last name, first name, or the name of the company 
that person represents. (Does your client Mike Wallace of ABC Company 
go under m, w, or a?) Whatever you decide, stick with the system for all 
your files so they’re grouped together and easy to retrieve.
 
 If you’re prone to look for files by date or if your files are continually 
evolving with newer versions each time they’re used, structure your 
system so that the date information is always part of the file or folder 
name. If you primarily access information based on when it was cre-
ated, regardless of the client or project, the date it was created is the 
most important item in your document or folder title. If due date is more 
important, make that part of the file name.
 
Inconsistency and even spelling or punctuation errors can send your folders 
and files to unintended locations, which can make them difficult if not impos-
sible to find later. Your computer organizes files in alphabetical and numerical 
order, so set some guidelines for how you plan to name your files before you 
start. For instance, regardless of where you place a date in your document or 
folder name, you need to create your date the same way each time. July 29, 
2008 ends up in a different location than a document titled with 7-29-2008 or 
even 072908. Also be consistent in whether your date comes at the end of the 
file name or the beginning.

86
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Because of all the information you want to include in the file name, your 
documents may have names that create a file path that is too long. An overly 
long file path can also prevent you from moving the document to another 
location, or in some cases even e-mailing the file. Abbreviations can help, but 
be sure to be consistent. If you abbreviate Joe’s Coffee Shop as JCS on one 
project and Joe’s CS on another, they won’t show up next to each other in 
your computer.
 
If you work in a fast-paced environment, set aside a blocked-out period of 
time each month to go through your current files and make sure they’re cor-
rectly labeled and filed. As time passes, it’s easy to forget which file belongs 
to whom and where it should go. Files can easily become lost forever, creating 
a huge time loss when you launch into an endless search and end up having 
to re-create a file from scratch. (Of course, you can always use the search 
function on your computer to look through a single document, subfolder, file 
folder, or your entire computer. After you find your missing document, check 
to see why it was misfiled in the first place and then correct the error.)
How far back must you keep files?
Depending on your business, you may have years’ worth of files you need to 
keep on your computer for a longstanding client or project. How often do you 
call up archived or non-active information? If you keep data and detail for a 
long time, you may set up a system that gives you quick access to “closed” 
files without cluttering your screen.
 
You may want to try keeping the current year or the last two years in your 
everyday files; by the time you need to look up those files only occasionally, 
create a subfolder where you can combine information for each past year — 
then put that folder in a different area. You may even be able to move this 
seldom-used information out of your personal files and into your company’s 
main folders on the server, which can keep your current computer files less 
cluttered and save you time.
How do you create new documents?
Do you work regularly with documents based off a template? For example, do 
you send out client contracts? Put together a weekly status report? Submit 
expense reports or check requests? Generate form responses? Think about 
the best system for pulling up the appropriate templates and revising them 
accurately and efficiently — and storing them so you can find them quickly.
 
If you create documents from scratch regularly, look for a way to create tem-
plates for frequently created formats to avoid reentering the same information 
for each version you produce.
Do you work on projects that generate multiple versions of documents? For 
example, do you have proposals that are reviewed, edited, and revised by 

87
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
numerous people? If so, you want to incorporate a system that allows you to 
easily track the history of changes and pull up what’s been done in the past. 
For instance, when people save new, updated versions of a document, you 
may have them alter the file name by adding their initials, adding an abbre-
viation to indicate a certain stage of a project, or dating everything so you 
don’t end up searching through proposals that are so old and outdated that 
you’ll never use them again. Make sure every knows the naming system.
Are most of the new documents you create specific to one issue or one 
client? When you spend time producing documents for specific clients, your 
organization method should make it easy to call up a client and identify 
everything related to that client.
 
If you’re constantly creating new documents, the job of organizing is more 
challenging. Your document load is heavy and constantly increasing. Consider 
setting up your organizational system by client or having an archive file where 
you store master contracts, proposals, letters, templates, checklists, and 
other regularly used items. You may also set up folders so these frequently 
used master files are easy to access.
Offloading excess by archiving or deleting
The more files your computer has on its hard drive to search, the more 
slowly it works. As with paper files, a key part of organizing your computer 
is removing what you don’t need to keep, including duplicate files. Electronic 
clutter is hard to see because unlike the physical stacks piling up on your 
desk, it tends to be invisible — until your computer slows or balks. I’ve found 
numerous copies of the same programs on my computer because I forgot 
that I’d installed earlier versions.
You know you need to archive when the icons proliferate on your desktop 
until it looks like the parking lot at a busy superstore. Archiving files doesn’t 
mean deleting those old files; it means backing them up to a CD, DVD, or 
other storage device. Whether you have a few desktops or a large server, 
archiving frees up hard-drive space and speeds your computer’s perfor-
mance. To weed out excess, follow these steps:
 
1. Search your computer to make sure that the programs installed are 
ones you need and that you’re using the most recent versions.
 
 Save the data in the old versions onto a CD or DVD, or update the pro-
gram and transfer it to the new version. Then send the old versions to 
your computer’s recycle bin or uninstall them.
 
2. Create a permanent archive directory or folder and get in the habit of 
archiving any files you don’t use regularly but want to keep.

88
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
Always label your CDs or DVDs. Don’t just throw them into storage in anony-
mous jewel cases. If nothing else, print hard copies of the disc’s contents, fold 
the paper to the size of the case, and secure the package with a rubber band. 
That way, if you come back to it five years from now, you’ll know what the 
disc contains.
 
Be sure to keep CDs and other storehouses in a safe place. Buy a fire safe 
that’s rated for electronic storage (read the label before you buy because 
not every safe protects CDs, zip or flash drives, or floppy disks). Store par-
ticularly important records, such as periodic complete system back-ups, in 
a safe deposit box. Also use multiple backups so you’re well-covered for a 
catastrophe — if one disc is corrupt, you don’t want to lose all your data. We 
used to back up daily at my companies with a different CD for each day, but 
we’ve since gone to mirrored servers. With mirrored servers, you always have 
a backup — if one server goes down, you can be up in minutes on the other 
server without losing data.
After you’ve purged the excess files, periodically defragment your computer. 
The process helps increase the speed of your computer so the data is com-
pressed and organized in a manner in the computer that it can find it easily.
Saving new files strategically
The Save As feature on your computer is one of technology’s greatest func-
tions — for personalization, for producing numerous letters with only minimal 
changes, or for tailoring presentations to specific groups without losing your 
original documents. When you save without Save As, you replace one file with 
another, losing potentially valuable information that could save you time later 
should you need that information for a similar situation in the future.
 
I had an assistant a number of years ago who never used the Save As function. 
When I customized a presentation based on an industry’s or client’s needs, 
my assistant typed and formatted workbooks and PowerPoint presentations 
and saved the customized information over previous versions of the file. In 
essence, she replaced every presentation with the most recent version. I lost 
at least a year’s worth of new ideas because my assistant didn’t make strategic 
use of Save As.
 
For all its benefits, the Save As option can also be your hard drive’s demise 
if you don’t use it judiciously — it’s too easy to create (and store) numerous 
documents that are almost identical. For example, if you have a master file of 
a letter to customers, Save As makes it a cinch to personalize the letter from 
your master file. But do you need to keep copies of all your personalized let-
ters? You may want to save the letter into the appropriate customer file, but 
you probably don’t need to keep a copy of every personalized letter in the 
master letter file (unless each version is different enough from the original 
that you may use the new version periodically in the future).

89
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
Managing E-mail Correspondence
If all the e-mail correspondence you’ve ever received, sent, saved, responded 
to, forwarded, and deleted were turned into paper mail, your output alone 
could probably fill a U.S. Postal Office. Of course, you don’t keep it all, but if 
you’re like me, you let your e-mail accumulate at times, perhaps until your 
system notifies you that your mailbox has exceeded its limit.
A good tool is only as good as the person wielding it. If you know how to use 
e-mail properly, it makes your productivity hum. If not, you can end up sabo-
taging your efforts to get things done. This section helps you rein in the all-
too-often unwieldy paperless communication system.
Filtering what comes in
Even militant time masters can lose hours of productive time to e-mail — and 
much of that e-mail isn’t even work-related. Sometimes it’s not even something 
you want to receive, yet you still have to dig your way through the sludge.
 
Spam is only one factor that adds to the deluge of e-mail you find in your inbox 
on a daily basis. If you’re like most people, you probably authorized or even 
requested most of the promotional e-mail you receive. Here are some tips to 
slow the flow of spam and other incoming e-mail that only clutter your inbox:
 
 Unsubscribe from newsletters or mailing lists that you no longer read. 
When you were starting up your organic garden last spring, a weekly 
e-mail about composting tips seemed like a great idea. Now you find that 
you almost always delete without opening. Time to put that idea to bed.
Cleaning up a hand-me-down computer
You may inherit hand-me-down computers filled 
with old files. If and when that happens, check 
organization dates or last-edit dates. Often, 
files have been passed on for generations of 
employees. Instead of sending the files out to 
be carbon dated, do the following:
  Store the file in an interim file so you can 
research it when you have time or archive 
it so it’s out of your way.
  Print out a hard copy and ask your boss or 
the computer’s previous owner whether 
you should save it.
  Save the file on a CD, zip or flash drive, or 
floppy disk and purge the file from your 
computer.

90
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 Think twice before signing on for new mailing lists. You may appreci-
ate a monthly newsletter about one of your hobbies. But instead of bulk-
ing up your inbox, why not add the Web site to your Favorites list and 
visit when it’s convenient for you?
 
 When ordering online, seek out the checked box that confirms your 
agreement to receiving e-mail — and uncheck it. Called the negative 
option response, many merchants include a box on the order form that 
indicates, “Yes, I want to receive regular notices about your company’s 
special offers.” That box is already checked off, for your “convenience.” 
In order to get nothing, however, you have to take action and get rid of 
that mark.
 
 When visiting or leaving personal or contact information on a Web 
site, always check the privacy policy to confirm that your information 
won’t be sold. You can usually find a link to the privacy notice at the 
bottom of the Web page or next to where you enter your information.
 
 Install spam-filtering software on your computer. Remember, though, 
that these programs typically don’t remove the spam; they simply filter 
it to your junk folder so you can review or simply delete.
 
 Don’t ever respond to spam. You may hope that your polite request to 
remove you from the mailing list will stop the mailings, but most often 
the opposite happens. Your reply confirms that your e-mail address is a 
valid one. You may start getting even more mail, and your address may 
be sold to other annoying spam-senders. Clicking on an opt-out link can 
also put you at risk if the e-mail is spam, so let your spam software do its 
job and leave it at that.
Employing an e-mail response system
 
During my formative years, I watched the TV show M*A*S*H with my family. I 
remember that when the wounded would come into the medical unit, the doc-
tors would perform triage, the process that determined patient priority. Does 
this wound need medical attention now? Will this soldier die without immedi-
ate care? Will this one die even if he receives attention? In this way, the medi-
cal team could most efficiently prioritize their work in a situation of chaos.
Performing triage is an excellent way to approach your e-mail responses. 
Some mail you get is dead on arrival, other messages are of interest to you 
but not critical to address immediately, and others need your attention right 
now. Those of you who can turn on your computer to find as many as 100 
new messages need the critical care of a good e-mail management system.
Here’s what works for me: When I open up my mailbox, I resort to the three 
Ds: delete, do it, or defer. Every e-mail fits into one of these categories.

91
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
Hit the delete
Although your computer doesn’t take up any more space if you have 10 
e-mail or 10,000, the clutter of useless, obsolete, irrelevant correspondence in 
your inbox can seem like a mile-high stack of stuff you have to carry with you.
Keep your inbox clean by discarding any e-mail that’s unimportant or long-
obsolete. As for the advertisements, forwarded jokes or urban myths; and the 
string of thanks, you’re-welcome, have-a-good-day, see-you-after-work corre-
spondence, read ’em (or don’t) and delete immediately.
Also delete without opening any e-mail with a subject line that seems too 
good to be true or seems like a marketing pitch from an unknown sender. 
How realistic is it to think that some company has sought you out to offer you 
an opportunity to make millions? And if a deal is really so incredible, would 
the advertiser really need to tell you that? Probably not. Beware any e-mail 
with subject lines containing misspelled words or words with symbols in 
place of letters (such as Fr** Mon!y).
 
Knowing how to delete helps everyone in your company. When employees 
share a network, the server fills up when everyone retains all e-mail, which 
can stop the flow of inbound e-mail for the whole company. Most networks 
establish a limit to the size of individual inboxes and send notices when you 
get close to the limit. Then it’s time for some major housecleaning. Better to 
keep up with the cleaning rather than let it build up.
Just do it
Just down the street from my high school in Portland, Oregon, is the headquar-
ters of Nike, the company that coined the phrase “Just do it.” That’s not bad 
advice for e-mail management, either. Of course, this do it response is critical 
if the matter is urgent or must be done today, but it’s also a sound strategy for 
most other e-mail, too. If a message warrants a response, do it. Now. Answer 
the question. Forward the message. Transfer the to-do to your task list or 
schedule. Send a response. If you need little more than a click or a minute or 
two to respond, file, or forward, then don’t waste time by keeping it for later.
Just as with mail or papers in your inbox, the best strategy is to handle it 
once (see Chapter 5) and then get it off your plate.
Defer until later
For those e-mail messages that aren’t critical-care matters, it may make sense 
to set them aside to address after you pass through all your correspondence. 
So you don’t forget and leave them buried in your inbox to be remembered 
too late, immediately place these e-mail messages in an appropriate folder so 
they’ll pop up later for your attention. Messages that fall into this category 
may include personal e-mail that you want to read carefully and to which you 
want to take time to craft a response. They can also include flexible–time line 
projects that don’t have to be done today or even this week.

92
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Actually, I just thought of a fourth D: delegate. It falls in the defer category. 
Although you can simply hit the Forward command and send the message 
along with instructions for carrying out the requested action, the reliability of 
e-mail is suspect enough that you want to remind yourself to follow up if you 
hear nothing back from the delegate.
Automating your responses
The ability to plan ahead with e-mail communication saves you loads of time. 
If you regularly field the same FAQs numerous times during the week or day, 
it may make sense to craft template e-mails of standard responses. Place 
these templates in a folder where you can easily access them and you’re 
ready to cut and paste your reply, using the form language and making the 
personal tweaks as necessary. For example, if you get queries from clients 
about the status of their projects, you may put together a standard response 
informing them that you’re attending to their project and will get in touch 
with them by such-and-such a date.
 
Don’t forget about the automated message function when you’re out of the 
office. Set up a message with the pertinent details: when you’ll return, whether 
you’ll be checking e-mail, when people can expect to hear from you, and who 
they can contact if they need immediate assistance.
Organizing and storing e-mail
Managing, organizing, categorizing, and filing your e-mail is a practice that 
can serve you as well as maintaining a well-organized paper filing system 
does. Many of your e-mail messages are probably important to you as refer-
ence, especially business correspondence. And you, like me, have probably 
searched in vain for that important e-mail you know you received, oh, maybe 
eight months ago.
Fortunately, you don’t have to print off every e-mail and stick it in a filing cab-
inet. Your e-mail program includes many valuable tools that help you keep 
information as close as a click of the mouse. Most e-mail programs include 
various folder and filing systems that serve, in a way, as a virtual lateral file 
cabinet — but searching and finding what you want is a lot easier, with just a 
little experience. You can sort and store your e-mail by a number of catego-
ries, grouping them by sender, date, project, importance, or subject. Here are 
just some ways you can use the features your e-mail software provides:

93
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
 
 Set up so that certain messages — periodic newsletters, for example — 
automatically route to a specific folder. (This tool works on the same 
concept as spam blockers, except these items go in a folder you actually 
want to see.) With the help of filtering software, you can flag specific 
e-mail addresses and automatically send them to a folder — or even 
delete them — before they hit your inbox. I find that most people use 
only a small portion of what their filtering features in their e-mail soft-
ware can do. Take a few minutes to explore your options — filtering 
takes very little time to set it up.
 
 Create a new-arrivals folder, defining new as a day, a week, or whatever 
you determine.
 
 Establish a dump folder that you clean out once a month or as often as 
you choose.
 
 Don’t look at all the e-mail in the dump folder before you dump them. 
That takes too much time. You’ve filtered them enough to be able to let 
them go.
 
 Make specific project folders where you can save relevant e-mail, pro-
viding a record of all conversations for the future. When you no longer 
need the file because the project is long-complete, you can delete it. 
This setup also presents a great backup system.
 
 Employ the search function to track down any correspondence about 
a certain topic. For example, if you’re looking for an e-mail outlining 
details for a trip to the Bahamas, you can type “Bahamas” in the search 
field and all inbox e-mail with Bahamas somewhere within the body or 
subject line will come up.
Managing Contact Info 
with a CRM Program
 
If you’re in business, you already know the profit to be tapped from existing 
customers. They’re already yours! In countless customer service studies I’ve 
read in the last 20 years, I’ve seen one conclusion over and over: It takes many 
times more effort, energy, and time to acquire a new customer than it does to 
retain an existing one.
No matter what your business, the ability to contact existing customers 
easily and frequently — with the inside knowledge of someone who knows 
them well as customers — is invaluable. Add the ability to send customers 
personalized communications at the exact time they’re in the market for your 
product or service, and you’re in business: profitable business. Even if cus-
tomers won’t need to replace your product for many years, you may be able 
to offer them related items or garner a referral to their friends.

94
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
One of the most valuable tools in business is a customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) program. CRM helps you maximize the service, communication, 
sales, and relationship-building with prospects and existing clients — the life-
blood of any business — by providing quick access to critical customer infor-
mation, whether you’re selling, serving, or invoicing.
Additionally, CRM enables your office practices to become nearly paperless, 
especially if you have compatible software that changes faxes into electronic 
documents. You can even enter notes into your CRM software while you’re 
on the phone with prospects and customers, allowing you to keep records of 
discussions in one centralized place, banishing sticky notes and random slips 
of paper. This automation saves time and money and provides practically 
unfettered access to documents and client files from anywhere in the world. 
What’s more, it’s kind to trees.
Looking at software and services
Most computers come with simple CRM systems. In Microsoft, it’s Outlook. 
However, Outlook isn’t powerful or customizable enough to keep more 
than basic client and prospect data, so I recommend ACT! (www.act.com) 
or GoldMine (www.goldmine.com). These two programs are affordable 
(around $500 for a single user) and readily available, and they’ve stood the 
test of time as high-quality CRM programs, so they’re reasonable tools for 
businesses big or small. They offer powerful abilities to customize your busi-
ness data, and they also help segment your customers and clients so you can 
tailor your communication, service, and sales strategies to particular groups. 
(For information on using the program features, check out ACT! 2007 For 
Dummies or GoldMine 8 For Dummies [Wiley].)
If you need multiple users, then you’ll need to establish a network for the 
CRM programs to run on so all people in your company have access. Another 
option is the SaaS (software as a service) model, in which you access the 
program online. In this case, a separate company houses the data and soft-
ware, charging you a monthly service fee per user for their CRM and all the 
servicing. Programs that operate that way include www.salesforce.com 
and www.sugarcrm.com. You have some options in what you use, but as a 
businessperson, not having a CRM program shouldn’t be an option at all.
Unleashing the capabilities 
of a CRM program
I can personally testify that, having used a CRM for nearly 18 years, a CRM 
can provide the following:

95
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
 
 More revenue in slower months
 
 Better service to current clients
 
 Increased referral business
 
 High levels of customer satisfaction
 
 More time for technicians to take new customer service calls
This section covers some of the ways you can use the program to make it 
happen.
Categorizing clients
You can use a CRM program to segment your clients, which is a tremendous 
strategy. All customers are important, but some are more important than 
others. Your most important customers
 
 Do more (and more profitable) business with you.
 
 Send more of their friends, neighbors, business contacts, family mem-
bers, and associates your way.
 
 Hold strategic positions in companies or organizations you’d like to do 
business with, meaning they can send even more business your way.
 
You can use CRM to reach out to clients based on their relationship with you. 
You can, for example, segment your customers and clients into three distinc-
tive categories:
 
 Platinum clients: These are your best customers. They’re delighted with 
your service, are likely to send you referrals regularly, and wouldn’t think 
of going anywhere else. CRM helps you stay in touch with them through 
newsletters, phone calls, or special correspondence on a regular basis.
 
 Gold customers: These people may not be as excited about you and 
your company as the platinum people, but they continue to do business 
with you, even if you get raves and referrals only when you ask. CRM 
helps identify gold-level clients and reminds you to communicate 
frequently — with the goal of raising them to platinum level.
 
 Bronze customers: These are folks who may only sporadically do busi-
ness with you, switching to other sources from time to time; or they’re 
individuals and businesses who haven’t called you for a long time. You 
can use CRM to help you make a more concerted effort to build a stronger 
relationship with them.
 
In addition to current customers, you can also segment prospects and cus-
tomize your communication with them. A strategic CRM program helps you 
categorize and organize your prospects as well as separate them from sus-
pects. (Suspects have a less than 50 percent chance of using your products 
or services. Prospects offer you a better than 50 percent chance of creating a 

96
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
new business relationship.) Using the technology of a CRM effectively, you can 
increase the frequency and effectiveness of contact and move the prospects 
up what I call the loyalty ladder more quickly.
Contacting target groups all at once
When you group your prospects, customers, and clients, you can commu-
nicate with them with a few keystrokes or clicks of a mouse. If deliveries of 
your pressure washers are back ordered, for example, you can easily notify 
all your pressure-washer customers. Or if you’re changing the pricing on the 
half-page ads in your magazine, you can contact all your customers and let 
them know. You may tell them that, beginning at month-end, ad prices go 
from $4,000 to $5,000 (but as valued customers, they can lock in the lower 
price by signing a one-year contract now).
Most CRM programs can merge information, including inserting customer 
and company names in both greetings and bodies of letters. This allows you 
to craft a generic e-mail or business letter, but use customer and company 
names in strategic spots so the letter is more personalized. It also saves you 
from writing 20, 50, or even 300 separate customer letters.
Putting customer contact on auto-pilot
After you categorize your customers and clients, you can take the final step 
to saving time with a CRM: automating customer contact. The companies and 
people who use CRMs most effectively automate everything. They have docu-
ments, communications, letters and systems, troubleshooting communica-
tions, and so on in the CRM. This allows the program to find the document, 
write the letter or e-mail, attach the document in a PDF file, and keep it in the 
current client record — all electronically. After you design an automated pro-
cess (who, what, where, when, and why), the CRM does the rest. You can even 
set up some programs, such as ACT! and GoldMine, to dial the phone for you.
CRMs let you set up long-term communication systems delivered through 
automation. After your customers receive their 5,000 tongue depressors, an 
automated thank-you note goes out. The following week, you (automatically) 
offer a special on gauze. The week after that, you may (automatically) send a 
customer-satisfaction survey. You can set this system up in advance for cus-
tomers, clients, prospects, and suspects in platinum, gold, and bronze groups 
(see the earlier “Categorizing clients” section for more on these groupings).
The CRM program can also integrate the notification for calls from different 
people in your company or department as well as e-mail and faxes. You can 
establish a system in which each person gets his or her marching orders 
from the CRM. For instance, you can tell Susie in accounting to send the 
invoice and tell Bob in sales to make a follow-up call at 3 days, 7 days, and 
14 days after the delivery; and the CRM will also generate a thank-you letter 

97
 Chapter 6: Fine-Tuning Organization Skills with Technology
that Sally in administration can send out tomorrow. And finally, Penny in cus-
tomer service gets the notice make a call in five days to check in on any train-
ing needs the customer has with the new product.
Creating effective client profiles
The building blocks of a profitable customer file are standard: name, address, 
phone number(s), e-mail address, and (if applicable) administrative assis-
tant’s contact info. These five or six bytes of information provide you with 
the start of a great customer record. To take customer communication to the 
highest level, however, you need more information.
 
The more you know about your customers, the easier it is to deter defections — 
times a client chooses to do business with someone else or refers business to 
another company or agency. That’s a killer for your business: Just think of the 
enormous time you’ve invested in getting and keeping your customers!
Figure 6-1 shows a chart you can use to increase your knowledge of your cus-
tomers and create more personal connections with them. You can program 
this information into your CRM by customizing the fields:
Say you’ve collected this information about your customers over time and 
you’ve entered it into your CRM. The next time you come across a couple of 
extra tickets to the golf tournament in town, you search your CRM for cus-
tomers who are golf fanatics and give them the tickets. Of course, it doesn’t 
hurt your relationship that the tickets came from you!
Another example: You see a great article about the University of Alabama. 
You search for University of Alabama alumni on your customer list and e-mail 
them the article. What have you invested? A few minutes of really listening to 
your customers (and you do that anyway, right?) and a few minutes of data 
entry. What have you achieved? You’ve brought your relationship with this 
customer to a new level and spent minimal time doing it.
 
If you really want to impress a customer, take great notes in your CRM and 
start the next call with something like the following:
 
 “How did (the wedding, your party, the conference) go?”
 
 “How was Bobby’s soccer game last week? Did his team win?”
 
 “What did you do with X? Last time we spoke, you said Y.”
Take a few moments of your time to note nuggets of information in your CRM, 
use that information to make your prospect or customer feel valued and 
unique, and watch your customer relationship grow and solidify.

Putting a CRM program on a server to 
maximize accessibility and backup
My rule: Everyone in the company must be able to access public information 
in real time at all times. All employees who serve or sell to customers need 
access to client documents and information. This is true for all departments: 
sales, marketing, administration, accounting, and so on. And you can set up a 
CRM program so all employees can tap into the data. Putting CRM on a server 
has security advantages as well.
 
Not only does having company data spread around on various computers 
create an organizational nightmare, but it also represents a security flaw — 
you can lose valuable customers in a keystroke. For example, if you have 
a salesperson who has given notice or, worse, one you’ve terminated, that 
person may have 200 customers — and all their customer information — 
saved on his or her computer. Before leaving, that person can easily delete 
every customer file in the computer.
Ouch! You just lost the history and possibly the contact information for 200 
customers. You also lost customers that current salespeople were hoping to 
close in the next 30, 60, or 90 days. Now you have to try to reconstruct which 
customers the salesperson sold to, what he or she sold to them, and what the 
customer-salesperson relationships were like. And you’re back figuring out 
how you can increase sales and service to these customers in the future.
 
If you have multiple independent computers with company data stored on 
each, I highly recommend that you connect your company’s computers in a 
network run by a server. Server-accessible CRM data ensures that your busi-
ness can avoid data-loss nightmares. With the CRM program, you can imme-
diately lock an ex-employee out of the system and have system backups to 
reconstruct data as needed.
Some companies may be reticent to open access to this information because 
of client confidentiality or simply the risk of corrupting or deleting important 
data. If you want to protect accounting, personnel, and other private informa-
tion, you can do that no problem. The programs offer password protection 
so that only certain employees can access the most confidential information. 
You can also set it up so employees can see the data but not delete or modify 
it in any way.

Taking Time Management 
on the Road
In This Chapter
 Getting organized before the trip
 Avoiding airport turbulence
 Packing like a travel pro
 Maneuvering on travel day
 Getting situated at your destination
T
he life of the road warrior is anything but a vacation. With airline conges-
tion, weather delays, cancellations, lost luggage, overbookings, botched 
reservations, unreliable wake-up calls, and other increasing frustrations of 
travel, careful planning and effective use of time on the road lay the ground-
work for a productive trip — and a smooth and enjoyable homecoming.
In this chapter, you discover how to prepare for your trip, minimize packing, 
make your flight productive, sail through airport security, and get to work in 
your room — all in good time. I also explain how to maintain your health rou-
tine on the road so you’re ready to go in the morning. Note: My wife, Joan, was 
a flight attendant for eight years, and she can testify to the grueling, frustrating 
nature of travel for work — and to the importance of careful time management 
on those trips. I have to acknowledge Joan’s valuable contributions to this chapter.
Organizing Trips for Peak Productivity
Just as I encourage you to plan out your hours, days, and weeks on a regular 
basis, I recommend the same strategy for the times you’re on the road. By 
planning ahead, you’re able to maximize your time, squeezing every drop of 
productivity from your trip. For each and every business trip you take, sit 
down in advance and be sure you address the issues I set out in this section. 
By following this process every time you travel, you reduce the potential for 
glitches, delays, and loss of productivity.

102
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Scheduling multiple engagements 
for one trip
I meet businesspeople whose travel schedules put them on the road as often 
as twice a week, sometimes sleeping at home for only a night before flying out 
for another one-day or two-day trip, often to a destination close to the one they 
just returned from. That makes about as much sense to me as stopping off at 
home between trips to the grocery, the gas station, and the dry cleaner.
Whenever possible, group your business trips together, creating one weeklong 
schedule instead of scattering several small trips over a couple of weeks. It’s 
bound to reduce your commutes to and from the airport and possibly your total 
travel time, and you allow for a longer stretch of home-base time for yourself.
 
Even if your destinations aren’t close to each other, it may still make sense 
for you to book multiple engagements for the same trip. You may do a little 
zigzagging in the skies, but overall, you’re using your time more efficiently. 
Why not fly from Chicago to Atlanta to Phoenix and back home to Dallas? 
Combining your three meetings into one weeklong travel-thon instead of 
spreading them out over two or three weeks keeps you home for a bigger 
block of time.
As you plan a scheduled business trip, ask yourself these questions:
 
 Do you have other upcoming travel obligations that you can take care of 
on this trip?
 
 Can you reschedule this travel commitment to a time when you have 
other meetings or events in that location?
 
 What else can you do or whom can you meet with in this destination or 
region?
 
 Can you perform some tasks there that you typically may not travel for, 
such as meeting with a client or vendor?
Identifying trip objectives
In the process of making polite chitchat on a flight, the same questions crop 
up with virtually every person I sit next to: “Flying for business or pleasure?” 
And “What brings you to fill-in-the-blank?” When my seatmate establishes 
that the trip is for business, he or she typically responds to the second ques-
tion with something like “Oh, I have a meeting with a client” or “Going to a 
conference.” Well, I don’t expect or want fellow travelers to tell me all the 
details about what they hope to accomplish, but I can tell you it’s critical to 
their success that they’ve answered the question for themselves long before 
they slide their laptop cases under the seats in front of them.

103
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
Identify your objectives before your trip. By getting a handle on your objec-
tives, you can do a better job of preparing for your trip. For instance, say 
you’re heading up a meeting of colleagues at the company headquarters to 
address a recurring communications problem and come up with a viable 
system that ensures all offices receive corporate directives in the same 
manner at the same time. By nailing down some specific objectives, you’re 
then able to identify other preparations necessary to accomplish your goals, 
such as closing the big sale on a new prospect or meeting with your best cus-
tomer to resolve delivery issues.
And no, when naming your objectives, “going to a meeting” or “attending 
a seminar” isn’t enough. What do you want to accomplish by the time you 
return home? Depending on your responsibilities and the purpose of the trip, 
your answers may look like some of the following:
 
 I want to learn everything I can about the client and her company.
 
 I hope to turn the prospect I’m meeting into a client.
 
 I intend to learn how to operate X software program so I can effectively 
perform a new function in my job.
 
 I’ll make a minimum of ten networking contacts for future business rela-
tionships during the workshop breaks.
 
 I plan to resolve the issue with the home office so we can return to our 
successful production levels.
Your objectives raise questions that allow you to effectively prepare. (See 
Chapter 13 for info on meeting and appointment preparation.)
Packing a full agenda
After you establish the who, what, where, and when of your trip, the next step 
is to determine the how — how you’re going to work all of this into your travel 
schedule. The solution is to pack each day to the fullest. Follow these tips:
 
 Schedule your day tightly. Don’t pad the time when you’re on the road. 
Factor in meeting length, travel time, preparation time, and even when 
you wake up, have meals, and get your exercise in for the day. When 
someone else is arranging or has influence on your schedule, ask for a 
specific time parameters so you can schedule your other obligations 
accordingly.
 
 Be firm about your time — don’t allow time overruns. When you need 
to be done, be done with what you’re doing. You may even tell anyone 
involved in advance when you have to be done with this meeting, discus-
sion, or appointment. That’ll increase the odds that you finish on time.

104
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 Wind it up before winding down. Devote some time to a daily debrief-
ing process. Review the day’s events and the information you gathered 
and take care of follow-up paperwork or wrap-up reports. Do this early 
enough in the evening so you can accomplish the necessary wind-down 
time before you head for bed. Otherwise, you may have difficulty sleep-
ing, which can lower your productivity for the next day.
 
 Right before bed is a good time to write thank-you notes to the people 
you’ve met with. Yes, thank-you notes — even before you get back to 
the office. Always travel with note cards or stationery and stamps. Your 
contacts will be impressed when they receive your note with a postmark 
from their location. You can drop the mail at the front desk as you check 
out from your hotel the next morning.
Tickets, Please: Making Plans 
to Go the Distance
Before you head out your front door, you need to book your hotel and set up 
your transportation. In this section, I discuss how to choose an ideal hotel, 
how to decide on a mode of transportation, and how to book the best flight.
 
When making reservations, I find that using a travel agent has its advantages, 
even though you pay a fee for the service. Many agents are able to compare 
all forms of transportation to give you the options you need to make the best 
choice. If you’re more of a do-it-yourself person, then I suggest going to the 
source directly. In recent years, I haven’t found much of a difference in price 
between booking a ticket directly with a major airline and going to a Web-
based service such as Expedia or Orbitz. The problem with online services is 
that they almost give you too many options, and looking at all those options 
takes a lot of time. I’ve also found that many of the options aren’t ideal for a 
business traveler because they have you coming back on the day following 
your trip or require an additional overnight stay.
Selecting a hotel
Selecting a hotel for its convenience is key. If you have an early morning 
meeting, there’s no substitute for staying a few minutes away rather than 30 
minutes away. Most of my speaking engagements are in hotels and confer-
ence centers, and I stay at the hotel where the convention or event is being 
held. The ability to walk downstairs and be on the platform far outweighs the 
advantages that other hotels may offer.

105
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
 
When you do have a choice of hotels, here are the time-saving amenities to 
look for:
 
 Internet access: High-speed Internet service, preferably wireless, is a must.
 
 A concierge: A concierge can help you select restaurants and make res-
ervations there. I’ve even had a few concierges track down clothing or 
personal items that I forgot and needed.
 
 Late night or 24-hour room service: As a road warrior, work constraints 
or even travel issues may prevent you from arriving at your final desti-
nation at the dinner hour. Room service ensures you stay fed.
 
 A good business center: It’s hard to bring all the tools that you need on the 
road with you. After all, a good photocopier is hard to get into an overhead 
bin. A business center with a computer you can use with a printer can really 
be a lifesaver at times. It also helps you check in and print out that boarding 
pass for tonight’s flight before you leave the hotel this morning.
 
 A quality workout facility: I prefer staying in hotels that have actual ath-
letic facilities rather than a retrofitted hotel room with a few machines 
stuffed in it. It ensures that a machine is available for you to use when 
you want to exercise — you’re not stuck waiting for someone to finish.
Planes, trains, and automobiles: Choosing 
your mode of transportation
Deciding whether to travel via plane, train, or automobile has a tremen-
dous effect on the use of time in today’s security-alert society. With the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issues at the airport, the 
savings you get from air travel is limited for travel that’d take less than two 
hours by train or automobile. By the time you arrive at the airport 60 to 90 
minutes in advance of a flight and actually travel by air, you could’ve driven 
there or taken the train.
One advantage that air travel has over the automobile is that you can use the 
time for work. Reading a report to prepare for your meeting while driving is 
pretty hard! At least with airline travel, you can get some work done in the 
airport awaiting your flight and on the flight.
A train can be a good choice, especially if you live in a big city on the East Coast. 
The frequency and schedules for commuter trains tend to be much better 
between large cities on the East Coast than other places. The security and check 
process takes much less time than at the airport, so you can save that time 
while still having a comfortable seat to work from for the duration of your travel. 
Additionally, most train stations are located in downtown areas or close to them, 
reducing the commute from the train station to your client’s downtown office.

106
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Booking a flight
 
Booking a flight for the middle of the day is a helpful strategy for avoiding 
rush-hour traffic and long lines at the airport, which is busiest in the early 
morning and early evening.
Also check the connections and airports that you’ll be traveling through. You 
don’t want to feel like the airport is your new campground, but you also don’t 
want a connection so tight that you have to run through the airport, either. I 
think that an hour connection time between flights is about right. It means that 
you’re not stuck for three hours between flights in limbo, but if your inbound 
is delayed, you still have a reasonable chance of making your connecting flight. 
If you have the minimum connection time of 35 minutes between flights, one 
weather delay can leave you scrambling to secure a seat on a later flight. And 
with airlines dramatically cutting their schedules, more people will be stranded 
due to weather and much fuller planes than ever before.
Seat selection is important for peak productivity. More than a curtain sepa-
rates first-class seating from coach. Space, boarding privileges, stowage, meals, 
amenities, and service are all better. For me, the extra seating space is reason 
enough to fly first-class anytime I can. With room to comfortably open my 
laptop, I can easily turn a cross-country flight into a five-hour work session. 
And when I fly internationally, especially if it’s an overnight flight, I arrive at my 
destination much more rested and ready to get down to business.
Cashing in on frequent flyer status
If you travel via air or are starting fly more often 
for business, signing up for frequent flyer pro-
grams can improve the experience dramatically. 
The more miles you travel, the more points you 
earn, which convert to more perks and benefits. 
Differences between a top-tier flyer and low-
mileage flyer can be dramatic — the more miles 
you’ve racked up, the better the seating, board-
ing, flexibility options, and extra benefits.
It pays to funnel as much of your flying to one 
carrier as possible so you can leverage more 
miles for more perks. Based on your typical 
business travel patterns, identify the airline that 
offers you the most routes and best connections 
for those destinations. If the choice is between 
a couple of different carriers, study the benefits 
and programs to see which gives its members 
the most services for their miles.
Are first-class upgrades an important benefit 
to you? If so, check out the type of planes that 
typically fly to your frequent destinations — 
how many first-class seats do they hold? Eight 
or 24? Obviously, your chances for an upgrade 
increase with the number of seats available.

107
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
The price of admission for first class or business class passage is signifi-
cantly more than a super-saver fare in coach. And for many businesspeople 
restricted by corporate travel policies, paying as much as five times more 
for the luxury isn’t an option. But if you’ve racked up enough frequent flyer 
miles, you may be able to gain admission without breaking the bank.
Some airlines offer special, roomier sections that cost less than first class but 
still provide perks. For instance, United Airlines has an Economy Plus section 
in some of its aircraft. The first ten rows or so offer about five inches more 
legroom. Typically, these seats are reserved for travelers who chalk up more 
than 25,000 miles a year with United. You can also purchase a yearly pass for 
$299 to book these roomier seats.
 
Booking your flight online allows you to view the plane’s seat availability and 
then book your preferred type of seat, if any are left. Here are some consider-
ations as you make your selection:
 
 Do you need to be able to disembark as quickly as possible? Go as far 
forward as possible.
 
 If you have a lot of laptop work or reading to do, a window seat means 
you won’t have two seatmates nudging past you when they make a trip 
to the restroom. Nor will you be disturbed as the drinks, snacks, and 
trash are passed back and forth under your nose.
 
 If you’re tall or you just prefer a little more legroom (so you arrive better 
rested and have more space to work), choose an aisle seat. If an exit row 
seat is available, you gain a few more inches, although some airlines add 
$25 to $50 to the price of exit-row seats.
Lightening the Luggage Load
 
I recently was on a multi-city weeklong tour with several speakers who trav-
eled together. As one of the newest speakers joined the group at check-in, we 
watched as he struggled with three large suitcases. The rest of us had regula-
tion carry-on bags or a single bag to check. We shook our heads and smiled 
as we anticipated his end-of-tour exhaustion after wrestling with those bags at 
every airport and hotel. “He’ll learn,” our glances at each other seemed to say.
Anybody who has spent a good amount of time on the road — be it for busi-
ness or pleasure — has picked up a singularly important lesson: The lighter 
your luggage and the fewer pieces of luggage you have, the better you can 
react to travel troubles and opportunities. Carrying the equivalent of a 
steamer trunk is only going to slow you down, wear you out, and likely cost 
you more money in overweight fines and extra tips to porters. This section 
explains how to lighten your burden.

108
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
Picking the right luggage for your travel needs is an important step. Invest 
in some good bags — at least two and possibly more. Short trips require the 
minimum of clothing and work materials, so a rolling carry-on with laptop 
compartment may do the trick. Extended travels may require a bigger bag 
with a garment section. Whatever your needs, pick sturdy pieces.
Sticking to carry-ons
In times when your luggage is likely to end up San Francisco, leaving you 
sleepless in Seattle, it’s no surprise that more travelers are opting to keep 
their possessions with them. I find that limiting my luggage to carry-ons also 
offers tremendous time savings. Even if I have to leave my luggage at the door 
to be stored underneath (with overhead-bin overload, flight attendants often 
call for passengers to leave their bags at the door for storage), my carry-on 
is waiting for me when I disembark, saving me that wait at the baggage claim 
and eliminating the possibility that my bag will be diverted to another des-
tination. Also, sticking to carry-ons may be cheaper: Unless you’re a top-tier 
flyer, you have to pay to check a bag or two on most air carriers.
 
Sticking to carry-ons gives you more flexibility to make last-minute flight 
changes. Since 9/11, security regulations have required travelers and their 
bags to travel on the same plane. So after you’ve checked in your luggage, you 
can’t make a last-minute change to your routing — even if weather, delays, or 
other circumstances make it a sensible option.
 
If you do plan to check your luggage, consider choosing nontraditional colors 
and shapes of luggage — and save some time at baggage claim eyeing yet 
another black soft-side bag like everyone else’s. You can also tag your bag 
with ribbon or a unique luggage tag to make it stand out.
Checking your baggage does allow you a more relaxed travel experience. 
(Who wants to feel like a Sherpa wheeling an unwieldy carry-on and weighed-
down backpack?) But weighing the pros and cons, carry-on wins out over 
check-in.
Addressing clothes quantity
I used to overpack for my business trips, anticipating every possible sce-
nario: What if I needed to go out in the evening with clients? What if I spilled 
mustard on my jacket — at each meal? What if I ripped my pants? So I carried 
the equivalent of nearly two changes of clothes a day. And I used the same 
strategy for my work-related materials, loading up a virtual library of books, 
reports, correspondences, and saved-up reading into my briefcase.

109
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
Well, experience taught me that I rarely go out in the evening, so the most 
casual attire is just fine for the room-service delivery person. And I turn out 
not to be the slob I feared — on the infrequent occasion that I spill some-
thing, a little water and soap usually removes the stain. And if not, hotel ser-
vices can take care of the cleaning or even sew up a pair of ripped trousers.
 
As you pack for your trip, consider every item and ask, “Is this critical to 
either my success or comfort?” If not, leave it home. Here are a few tricks I’ve 
picked up over the years:
 
 Color-coordinate your clothing and shoes so you can mix and match 
items, expanding your wardrobe without packing more.
 
 Fold and place all your dress shirts in a box (instead of hanging them) 
for more efficient packing — and less ironing when you unpack them.
 
 Carry ties on a caddy that rolls them up. You can find these in most 
travel magazines.
 
 Stick socks or other small items inside your shoes to maximize space.
 
 Those plastic bags that shrink-wrap clothes to take up two-thirds less 
space really work — especially for bulky items.
 
 Find out what items your hotel makes available. You may be able to leave 
behind your bathrobe, slippers, hair dryer, cotton swabs, and more.
Carrying work materials: 
A case for being brief
In addition to choosing a travel wardrobe, the business traveler has to pack 
all the necessary work materials for a productive trip. The modern “brief-
case” holds a laptop or Blackberry, a cellphone, business cards and contact 
information, relevant files, reports and research materials, PowerPoint pre-
sentations, and more.
 
As soon as you’re on the road, you want to have absolutely everything you 
need to guarantee a successful trip — but it’s still a good idea to strive for a 
minimalist approach. Consider these ideas:
 
 Invest in the smallest laptop model that you can comfortably use and 
that meets all your storage needs.
 
 Keep reports and research files on your computer instead of carrying 
printouts.
 
 Start a tear file for your travels. Instead of stuffing a stack of magazines 
into your bag, quickly flip through your periodicals before the trip and 
tear out the articles you want to read.

110
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
 
 Store your books on an electronic reader. I recently purchased a Sony 
Reader, a 
1⁄2-inch-thick, postcard-sized device that lets me store 160 
books. I used to travel with two or three hardback books. What a 
difference this technology has made!
Compiling your travel details
You can cut a lot of items from your luggage, but a collection of your travel 
details isn’t one of them. On-time flights are becoming rarer — and that’s on 
top of all the possible trip-ups at check-in, security check, and boarding. And 
after you arrive, there’s all the hassle with car rental reservations or secur-
ing transportation and hotel check-in. Each step of your journey seems to 
require its own special password, code, document, and procedure. Fumbling 
at any one of these steps can send your progress screeching to a halt.
 
Whenever you travel, carry a comprehensive itinerary — which I call a travel 
map — that includes every airline record locator, reservation number, trans-
portation detail, hotel location, time table, and contact phone number that 
you may need. Place all your info in chronological order for easy access. That 
way, if you run into a problem, say, with the hotel check-in (they lost your res-
ervation!), you can pull out your reservation detail showing the time of book-
ing, your reservation number, what kind of room you requested, and — voila! 
Everything is settled and you pick up your room key.
Some of the details captured in your travel map may include the following:
 
 Airline information: Include flight numbers, departure and arrival 
times, record locators, seat assignments, and the airline reservation 
phone number.
 
 Terminal information: If you’re connecting to other flights, this info tells 
you whether you have to hustle from one terminal to another to make 
your flight.
 
 Ground transportation details: Gather car rental reservation numbers 
or car service information for each leg of your trip. Include the costs you 
were quoted when you made your reservations in case there’s a dispute 
about the rate.
 
 If you’re driving, you need directions to where you’re going, as well 
as some idea of traffic issues, rush-hour times, road construction, and 
areas to avoid before you arrive. Plenty of Web programs, such as 
MapQuest, can give you that information in advance. Plot your route and 
print out the map before you leave home.
 
 Hotel information: Include the reservation number, address and contact 
details, a map if you’re driving to the hotel, shuttle details if applicable, 
room type or preferences requested, and the room rate you were quoted.

111
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
 
 Meeting details: Include the location, directions to, start and stop times, 
and contact information (in case you are unavoidably late or lost).
The other option is to download all that information into your PDA schedule. 
This allows you to avoid the paper altogether (depending on the length of 
your trip and the complexity of your travel schedule, you may have a note-
book’s worth of paper).
 
Carry your confirmation printouts from the airline, hotel, or transportation 
service in paper. In case there’s a question whether you actually have a 
reservation, you want to have proof.
Taking Wing: Making the 
Most of Travel Day
When you travel by air, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you’ve 
given up some control for the convenience of a swift journey. Weather, 
mechanical delays, overbookings — you can’t do much if these situations 
occur. The best way to make a travel day as smooth as possible is to take 
control of what you can: being packed and ready to go well before flight time 
is a biggie — and checking in for your flight from home is another.
Confirming flight status before you leave for the airport is another way to 
take control and avoid sitting around the airport needlessly. Many airlines 
and travel booking sites now provide electronic flight updates by e-mail and 
telephone, even text messages to your cellphone. You can request notifica-
tion about changes or delays to your flight; such alerts can give you an hour 
more at work or a little more family time at home.
In this section, I give you some other suggestions to make getting there as 
smooth and productive as possible.
Navigating the post-9/11 airport
The world of air travel changed dramatically after 9/11. The lines got longer, 
patience got shorter, and travelers were forced to do the half-Monty at 
security checkpoints. You can minimize the snags and slowdowns of airport 
check-in and security, but it does require a little planning.

112
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Flying through check-in
If you want to bypass that interminable wait while the check-in person seems to 
type a college thesis into the keyboard before generating your boarding pass, 
check yourself in via one of the electronic self-service kiosks that most airlines 
have available. In fact, the self-check-in is now the rule rather than the exception. 
If you have bags to check, you still have to deal with one of the attendants after 
you’ve generated your boarding pass, but the wait is usually short.
Even better, most carriers allow you to check in up to 24 hours in advance 
from your home computer. Print your boarding pass at home, and if you don’t 
have check-in luggage, you can skip the entire process and go straight to secu-
rity check. If you do have luggage to check, you still save time; you simply have 
to go to the counter for them to check your ID and take your bags.
Online check-in offers many benefits:
 
 You can respond to problems with seating and flight changes earlier.
 
 The earlier check-in reduces your odds of getting bumped from the 
flight. (Although you can still volunteer to give up your seat and earn 
future travel benefits in case of overbooked flights.)
 
 You can get to the airport a little later. Most airlines cut off check-in at 
least 30 minutes before departure, so passengers are advised to arrive 
anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half early. Checking in at home 
buys you a little more time.
 
You may be able to take advantage of off-site check-in for your return flight as 
well. More and more, hotels are setting up lobby computer kiosks for guests to 
check in prior to leaving for the airport — definitely an amenity worth asking 
about before you book your hotel reservation.
After you confirm that your flight is on schedule, leave for the airport in 
plenty of time, padding a bit for possible traffic congestion or construction 
detours. If you’ve checked in from home and only have carry-on luggage, 
plan to arrive at the airport 60 minutes before your flight. With check-in bags, 
schedule 90 minutes for domestic flights and 2 hours for international depar-
tures. In most cases, this should get you to your gate without sweating it, 
even allowing for a check-in snag or security jam.
 
Don’t arrive at check-in less than 30 minutes before your flight is to depart: 
The airline is likely to deny you boarding — and it has every right to! Get to 
the check-in desk with less than a half hour before departure, and you just 
may find that your seat has been given to a standby passenger.
 
Arriving early gives you a chance to put your name on a list for a better seat 
assignment. Passengers may have missed connections or simply don’t show. 
And other passengers may have received upgrades, leaving a roomy exit-row 
seat or an aisle seat up front open.

113
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
Passing through security
With ongoing concerns about safety, you still can anticipate potential conges-
tion at the security checkpoint. Allow plenty of time for this step. Depending 
on your flyer status and airport, getting to the gate for departure can take 
upward of 90 minutes — especially if you’re selected for a search. Don’t cut it 
too close.
 
To avoid being part of the security slowdown, follow these guidelines:
 
 Visit www.tsa.gov and review guidelines from the TSA before you pack.
 
 Choose shoes and a jacket that slip off easily — you’re expected to 
remove them.
 
 Leave behind or pack any jewelry that’s prone to set off the metal detector. 
Unclasping necklaces and slipping off bracelets can hold you up.
 
 Limit electronics and pack them neatly. A tangle of too many wires, 
cables, and gizmos in your carry-on is likely to trigger a search. And of 
course, any electronics you do bring should be easily accessible — you 
have to pull your laptop computer from your carry-on.
 
 Pack your quart-sized plastic bag of liquids and gels in an outside pocket 
of your carry-on so you don’t have to dig for it. And don’t take more than 
the 3-ounce limit per container. They will confiscate your regular-sized 
shampoo. And remember, tubes of toothpaste are considered liquid, too.
 
If you have frequent flyer status, ask the customer service representative at 
check-in or a TSA employee whether there’s an express security line. In many 
airports, the express lines aren’t well-marked. If they don’t have one, consider 
sending a complaint to the airline to get working on it with TSA.
Taking advantage of airline clubs while you wait
One of the best ways to use your wait time at the airport is to spend it in an 
airline club room. By joining United’s Red Carpet Club, American Airlines’ 
Admirals Club, or Delta’s Crown Room, for example, you can relax away from 
the crowds in the gate area and enjoy a number of amenities.
Snacks and beverages are available to members. The seating is much more 
comfortable, with cozy chairs and lounge areas, as well as work spaces with 
Internet connections — some carriers such as Alaskan Airlines provide free 
access. There are even conference rooms. If you have a lot of time between 
connections, you can work while grounded, sending e-mail and forwarding 
documents you may have completed during your flight — or at least enjoy a 
quiet place to read, relax, and recharge your batteries.
 
Some of the airline clubs have reciprocal privileges with other carriers, so be 
sure to check on this if you’re flying another carrier.

114
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Boarding early
I’m a believer in early-bird boarding. I know a lot of people like to wait until 
everyone else is on so they don’t have to sit in sardine-formation any longer 
than necessary. But if you’re one of the last to board, you probably won’t be 
sitting near your carry-on because the overhead bins in your section may 
have filled up. As soon as the gate agent begins calling for passengers, board 
at your earliest opportunity.
Preempting delay disasters
If you travel with any frequency, you’ll inevitably find yourself at the gate 
or aboard the plane, listening to the announcement that the flight has been 
delayed or cancelled. After the collective groan, get ready for a stampede of 
passengers desperate to secure whatever remaining seats there may be on 
the next flight out. If you’re sitting at the back of the plane when this occurs, 
you may find yourself at a distinct disadvantage.
 
Don’t despair when you find you’re likely to miss a connecting flight due to 
delays. While still making your way along with the rest of the pack, turn on 
your cellphone and start dialing the airline’s toll-free reservation line (pro-
gram the number into your cell before you leave home). Of course, other pas-
sengers are probably doing the same thing, but you still improve your chances 
of rebooking on the next flight. Although only one or two gate agents may be 
reticketing customers, there are likely many more operators doing the same 
thing over the phone. Cover your bases, though: Stay in the customer service 
line — you may find yourself listening to a medley of hold-music greatest hits 
and actually reach the live agent first.
Making good use of flight time
Advance planning ensures that you make the most of your flight time. To 
begin with, don’t attempt any serious work or reading during the boarding 
and take-off stages of the flight — too much competition. If you’re on a longer 
flight, wait until the onboard entertainment starts, the hustle and bustle of 
drink delivery is over, and the cabin is quieter.
Now is the time to get out what you really want to get done. Be realistic about 
what you can accomplish under the circumstances. For example, writing a 
book chapter requires a level of focus that I simply can’t achieve while flying. 
Nor can I develop strategic plans with my laptop on my tray table. But I can 
write articles for magazines or online publications. I can analyze data, ponder 
problems, contemplate ideas, and discover solutions.
Take a look at this list of productive activities you may be able to devote yourself 
to while flying, depending on your energy level, focus, and concentration level:

115
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
 
 Catch up on the news.
 
 Review reports.
 
 Write e-mail messages to send later.
 
 Read your tear file.
 
 Plan sales strategies.
 
 Write performance evaluations.
 
 Review your presentation for tomorrow.
 
 Tweak your PowerPoint presentation.
 
 Escape into a good book.
 
Many veteran business travelers report that it’s easier to accomplish work 
on outbound flights. A higher energy level, a measure of anticipation, and 
perhaps even more pressure to be successful during the upcoming meetings 
seem to motivate these professionals. So with this in mind, try to take full 
advantage of this drive and make the most of your outbound travels.
I usually bring light reading for the homebound trips at the end of the week. I 
find that my brain is anticipating getting home to be with family, so reading a 
lighter book for pleasure allows me to slow down and transition from Dirk, the 
business owner and driven sales professional, to Dirk, the doting family man.
 
Of course, work success or even a nice nap isn’t a possibility if you’re easily 
distracted by all the activity around you. Pilot and flight attendant announce-
ments, chatting seatmates, crying babies, drink service, and possibly even a 
movie all compete for your attention in the air. So a must-have, in my view, 
is a noise-canceling headset that cuts down the ambient background noise. 
The roar of the engines goes down to a dull roar or hum. The headsets are 
available in numerous forms and price ranges. Carrying your own music can 
also help you block distractions. I’ve found that classical music is an excellent 
selection for productivity, focus, and background noise abatement.
Soaring through the Rest of the Trip
Tray tables are now in the upright and locked position, landing gear is 
engaged, and all electronic devices have been turned off. You’re coming in 
for a landing and ready for the next chapter of your journey. Although you’ve 
made it to your destination, you still have a lot to do before you can deem 
this business trip a success — and I cover that in this section.
So put your books, games, laptop, reading glasses, and any other possessions 
in your bag and get ready. (Though you may want to keep that magazine in 
the side pocket for easy access, just in case there are delays in taxiing to the 
gate and disembarking.)

116
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Moving on: The ABC’s of 
ground transportation
I admit it: When it comes to getting around in a strange city, I’m a snob. I go 
for a car service over a taxi, shuttle, or car rental. First, with a car service, 
the driver meets me as I exit the gate area — from that point on, I have less to 
think about. The driver, holding a sign with my name on it, directs me toward 
baggage claim (if I’ve checked in luggage), grabs my bag, and guides me out 
toward the car. I don’t have to look for the car rental shuttle or search for the 
taxi line and make my way to a hotel on roads that I’m unfamiliar with. I’m 
probably exhausted from a day of travel, it may be late at night by the time I 
arrive, and I most likely have an important meeting that I want to be fresh for 
first thing the next day.
A car service strips the experience of stress and provides comfort and conve-
nience for about $20 more than a typical taxi ride. To my mind, that’s a small 
price to pay.
 
If you have to take a taxi, make sure it’s an authorized line for safety and cost 
reasons. Many airports have a taxi queue — where passengers wait in line and 
the airport representative asks you where you’re going, directs you to the next 
waiting cab, and gives you a receipt with the set rate. If you’re approached 
outside the gate by individuals offering taxi service, pass them by — they’re 
most likely unauthorized drivers.
If you’re renting a car, you save time and money when you join a priority club 
from one of the major rental companies. Priority club status allows you to 
bypass the line that all the other customers have to go through. Your name is 
on the LED board, so you proceed to your car and are out of the parking lot 
in less than a few minutes. Many companies waive the annual club fee if you 
have a preferred credit card. For example, a Platinum American Express card 
member gets a free Hertz #1 club membership annually.
Most rental companies offer cars with a GPS navigational feature, and they’re 
a huge time-saver. The audio warnings guide you to your destination, turn by 
turn. And if you do get off course, you hear the friendly and patient navigator 
alert you that it’s recalculating your route.
Mastering hotel room productivity
Your productivity journey starts at check-in at the hotel. Being a member of 
the hotel brand’s frequent-guest program can speed up check-in.
If you’re traveling alone, request a room with a king-sized bed instead of two 
doubles. You end up with a bigger bed and more space in which to move 

117
 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
about the room. Because the single king opens up more room space, you may 
even get better or more furniture — a sofa and sitting area in addition to a 
desk and workspace.
Follow a routine when you enter your hotel room after check-in. For example, 
I call for a bathrobe, which saves me having to pack it or other additional 
clothes for an evening in my room. I check the Internet connection and set up 
my workstation. If I’m going to watch some television, I heat up the iron to do 
my pressing for the next day. If I’m staying in the hotel for a few days, I do all 
the ironing at once.
 
Know yourself well enough to recognize your energy and level of focus. At 
times, you can really get work done when you’re in a hotel room; other times, 
you’re too tired from the day’s travel. Select the right activity based on your 
energy, intensity, and focus right now. Don’t waste your time trying to grind 
through a report that you know you can’t focus on. Instead, take a nap or go 
to bed early for the evening and get up earlier, when you’re refreshed and can 
focus better. Nothing is worse than staring at the paper, a report, or your com-
puter screen when your head isn’t clear.
Using room service to help 
manage your time
Room service saves you the hassle of going out to eat and can give you some 
much-needed alone time. I have to admit I order room service for more than 90 
percent of my meals when I’m on the road. After a long day spent around people, 
I’m peopled out. I like nothing better than to return to the quiet of my room, read 
the paper while eating my dinner, and catch up on the news or the sports of the 
day on TV. I prefer to stay away from noisy restaurants, loud music, and bois-
terous crowds. And this solitary time also allows me to do other housekeeping 
items while I wait for my food to be delivered. I can unpack, organize, work out, 
or iron while the chef is preparing my meal. I can even request delivery at a cer-
tain time to coincide with the completion of my workout or tasks.
I use room service for breakfast, too. I highly encourage the use of the night-
before door hanger for putting in your breakfast order, one of the greatest 
time-saving devices in any road warrior’s arsenal. You can order your break-
fast to be delivered at any time you desire. Most hotels offer this service. It 
beats calling room service in the morning only to find out it’ll be 45 minutes 
before they can deliver your breakfast.
This service lets me plan my whole morning in advance. When I want to wake 
up, work out, spend my quiet time in prayer and reading, and shower, I can 
do all those and still have my breakfast in my bathrobe before I get dressed 
for the day. It’s a beautiful thing!

118
Part II: Establishing a Good System 
Eating to win
Proper eating on the road helps you optimize 
energy so you’re more productive throughout 
the day. However, eating on the road is always 
a challenge. Choices are often limited to taste-
less prepackaged airport fare, trans fat–filled 
carryout, overly rich and heavily sauced chain-
restaurant entrees, or the limited selection of 
club sandwiches, buffalo wings, and cheese-
cake on the after-hours room service menu.
To avoid being stuck with a growling stomach 
and no alternative but vending machine snack 
foods, it’s best to have a preemptive plan of 
attack. Here are a few ways to eat timely meals 
without resorting to fast food:
  Pack your own. The demands of travel, busi-
ness meetings, and work engagements may 
limit your opportunity for a leisurely repast 
and force you into stuffing down whatever 
sustenance you can find at odd times, so 
bring provisions for your stay. If not a sand-
wich, at least pack a couple of energy bars, 
nuts or trail mix, a banana or apple.
  Choose airport food wisely. More and 
more, airport eateries are offering to-go 
items such as healthy subs, wraps, salads, 
and fruit to buy and carry on the plane. So 
instead of counting on peanut packages 
or overpriced sandwiches that don’t taste 
much better than the paper they’re pack-
aged in, carry your meal onboard.
  Start the day off with a full tank. Before 
confirming your hotel reservations, check 
to see whether it offers a full complimen-
tary breakfast — the kind with fresh fruit, 
yogurt, bagels, maybe even cooked omelets 
and sausage. Many hotels advertise free 
breakfast, and it’s no more than a tray of 
store-bought Danish or donuts and canned 
orange juice — not enough fuel to power 
your morning.
  Preview hotel dining options. Ask about 
room service and delivery service from 
nearby restaurants. What are the hours 
for room service? Can you order fresh and 
healthy at midnight? Are there healthy selec-
tions — fish or chicken with vegetables 
instead of fries? Do some options meet any 
dietary restrictions you have (low-sodium, 
vegetarian, and so on)? If the hotel room 
service is limited, do nearby restaurants 
deliver? And are there walk-to options?
  Visit the local grocery. A quick trip to a 
nearby supermarket can help you stock 
up on some nutritious essentials. If all 
else fails — room service is closed, the 
pizza delivery estimate is two hours, and 
the vending machine won’t accept your 
wrinkled dollars — a supply of emergency 
rations can see you through till morning. 
Ask whether the hotel has rooms with a 
mini-fridge to keep your perishables fresh.
Fitting in your fitness routine
Whether it’s taking a long walk, stretching out or practicing yoga in 
your room, or hitting the hotel pool, a little bit of physical activity 
goes a long way in keeping you fit, alert, and productive. When you’re 
out of your routine, you tend to slip into behaviors that may not be 
the healthiest. You may eat fat- and sodium-heavy fast food — and 
more of it. You’re probably sitting more and moving less. The stress 
of travel is likely taking its toll on your mood, as well.

 Chapter 7: Taking Time Management on the Road
Taking time to exercise while on the road helps offset these unhealthy 
aspects of travel. Commit to some sort of physical workout every day — it 
doesn’t have to be your full-blown regimen. Here are some travel options:
 
 Book yourself in a hotel that has a fitness center with the sorts of equip-
ment you like to use: treadmills, elliptical machines, free weights. If 
you’re a swimmer, make sure the hotel has an indoor pool. (Call ahead 
to make sure it’s open and working.)
 
 If you do yoga or a floor routine, pack your mat and other equipment 
(blocks or bands). More and more, hotels are beginning to stock these 
items for guests, so check first to see whether they have what you need.
 
 If you belong to a gym or club with a national presence, check to see 
whether there’s a branch in your destination and whether you have 
reciprocal privileges.
 
 If all else fails, find a nearby mall or park and plan for a daily vigor-
ous walk. Or do a simple equipment-free routine involving push-ups, 
crunches, and lunges.

rom a faulty alarm clock to a client who doesn’t show 
for a meeting, unexpected time management obsta-
cles seem to pop up every day. And then there are prob-
lems that rest solely on your shoulders: procrastinating, 
overscheduling, forgetting to record a task on your to-do 
list. Whatever their origin, most of these time vampires 
are hard to eliminate. But you can take precautions to 
ward off their evil power, and in Part III, I offer you plenty 
of rays of light.
The ability to communicate effectively can help increase 
earnings and quality of life, so in Chapter 8, I look at com-
munication as an art form — one that you can shape to 
enhance your productivity. Chapter 9 gives you the 
secrets to warding off interruptions, whether they come 
from the phone, e-mail, co-workers, family, clients, or 
bosses. I follow this with advice on keeping procrastina-
tion and indecision at bay in Chapters 10 and 11.

W
hen communication goes awry, the impact is often subtle, though no 
less time-consuming and expensive. For instance, in a 1998 survey by 
a temporary agency, employees estimated that 14 percent of their work week 
was wasted by poor communication. That’s more than 5.5 hours per week — 
and more than 290 hours per year! Studies also show that managers spend 
80 percent of their time communicating and that 80 percent of work mistakes 
are due to miscommunication.
Everyone makes real efforts to get messages across to family, friends, col-
leagues, business associates, and supervisors. But as these figures illustrate, 
many of those messages fail because they’re unclear, inaccurate, or too long. 
And for every message that doesn’t succeed, you waste time: repeating, redo-
ing, reworking, and reorganizing. In this chapter, you discover how to head 
off those problems by choosing your medium and using it effectively, keeping 
your message direct, and asking the right questions.

124
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Choosing the Right Medium 
for Your Message
Whether you realize it or not, you communicate in three main ways: words, tone 
of voice, and body language. When you communicate with someone face-to-face, 
you can employ all three forms of communication, dramatically increasing your 
effectiveness and speeding your way to the desired outcome. When you com-
municate over the phone, you use two, and when you do so over e-mail, you’re 
down to one. So despite e-mail’s speed and efficiency, sometimes a face-to-face 
meeting or a phone call is the best way to address and resolve the situation.
How you decide which medium is most appropriate for the information or for 
your topic of discussion depends largely on the complexity of the informa-
tion you’re sharing as well as on the nature of the topic of discussion. When 
you have to communicate by e-mail or telephone rather than in person, you 
need to make these channels work for you as much as possible.
Communicating face-to-face
As companies expand, merge, spin off, morph, and spread their influence 
throughout the world, an increase in meetings seems to be one of the side 
effects. And you can’t outrun meetings simply by getting transferred to a 
remote office. Advancements in audio and video conferencing make even 
telecommuters vulnerable to meeting overload.
The purpose of a good strategic meeting is to communicate goals, identify objec-
tives, seek counsel and advice, share knowledge, solve problems, and gain coop-
eration from others. Although I concede that sometimes just having face time 
with a group of co-workers brings value, it’s not a good enough reason to hold a 
meeting. You may be better served to build camaraderie in another way.
 
The value of the meeting needs to clearly meet or exceed the costs. Identifying 
the costs can provide a strong motivation to reconsider the need for a meeting 
when so many other communication options are at your disposal. My formula 
for evaluating the time cost is a bit more complex than simply adding up the 
hourly salary for all the attendees. I also figure the following:
 
 Time invested in preparation for that meeting
 
 Time for the meeting host to design the agenda, goals, and objectives 
 
 Time to coordinate and communicate meeting details to all participants 
 
 Time required to travel to the meeting, whether people are coming from 
across town or across the continent

125
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
After I add up all investment of company resources for even an hour-long 
meeting, the labor costs alone are often in the thousands of dollars for a typi-
cal meeting. So before you call a meeting, make sure that face-to-face commu-
nication is absolutely required to do one of the following:
 
 Solve the problem
 
 Make a decision
 
 Share information
 
 Plan and facilitate a project
 
 Launch action
Apply your “necessary” test to standing meetings as well. Sure, your depart-
ment holds an update every week: same time, same place. But if you find that 
week after week, everyone drones off status reports or presents information 
others already know or can get in some other way, reconsider the value of the 
weekly commitment. If there isn’t a significant reason to hold your meeting this 
week — or any week — come up with a better, quicker way to communicate.
 
Countless studies have pointed out the power and effectiveness of face-to-
face communication. Face-to-face communication is best for situations where 
tone of voice and/or body language is crucial in determining how to respond. 
Here’s some of what you can effectively do in a meeting:
 
 Present or sell new ideas
 
 Deal with emotionally charged concerns
 
 Carry out personal or professional evaluations or disciplinary actions
 
 Discuss complex topics that may require explanation or clarification
 
 Hand controversial situations that generate back-and-forth discussion 
among a group of people
 
 Communicate when there’s a chance that meaning may be misconstrued
 
 Discuss sensitive or confidential issues
For instance, if you’re in sales and you sell a complex product or service such 
as MRI machines or consulting services, a phone call can help you book an 
appointment, but you should make the sale through a series of face-to-face 
meetings. Or if you’re breaking up with your boyfriend of two years, meeting 
face-to-face to explain why you’re kicking him to the curb is more acceptable 
in breaking-up etiquette.
If you’re hesitant to call a meeting but it fits in one of the preceding categories, 
consider whether you can keep the meeting small or dovetail it into an existing 
meeting.

126
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Vocalizing your message over the phone
In my opinion, the telephone remains one of the greatest time-saving com-
munication devices ever created. Certainly, the phone offers advantages over 
face-to-face encounters because you don’t have to drive to get to where the 
other party wants to meet. And although many people feel e-mail has over-
taken the telephone, I prefer the telephone because it’s more personal, more 
interactive, and more adaptable. Here’s why the telephone is tops:
 
 Calling can bring a discussion to a quicker conclusion. You can get 
instant feedback and response from a phone call.
 
 The phone reduces chances that the other party will misinterpret your 
words. You get a chance to correct misunderstandings in real time 
rather than hours or even days later.
 
 You send a more personal sense of warmth and caring; and you get to 
use your tone, volume, and selected words to convey meaning via your 
voice. E-mail, on the other hand, allows readers to filter the communica-
tion through their current attitudes toward business, life, and you — 
without your input.
Should the person you’re trying to reach not answer the phone, leave a voice 
message — don’t hang up and try a different means of communication. Voice 
mail offers myriad advantages e-mail messages and messages taken by other 
people don’t:
 
 With voice mail, your message will be delivered verbatim. And because 
you’re not leaving the message with a person, an overzealous assistant 
won’t screen it out.
 
 Because you can speak faster than you can type (or even text), voice 
mail is faster than e-mail.
 
 Your message won’t get zapped by the spam filter or mixed with the 
hundreds of other e-mail messages your addressee receives daily.
See the “Corresponding Clearly and Confidently via Telephone” section later 
in this chapter for tips on leaving effective voice messages. And if you’re in 
sales, be sure to read my book, Telephone Sales For Dummies, for valuable 
advice on increasing your phone sales results.
Putting messages in writing: The joys 
(and perils) of e-mail
As with all seismic tech changes, e-mail has its infinite blessings — and its 
bitter curses. E-mail can help you get more work done, but it can also distract 

127
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
you from working. Younger readers may have only heard about the days 
when business correspondence was conducted through the mail. But those 
old enough to remember a time before computers and voice mail recall that 
the only way to get an immediate response from a colleague meant a phone 
call — and I’m not talking text-messaging. You had to actually talk to them!
 
It’s hard to imagine a time before e-mail. Sometimes, when I’ve just firmed up 
a speaking engagement with a client in Asia after one day of e-mailing, I can’t 
fathom how I ever got anything accomplished! Even within my own staff, I can 
shoot off several projects, answer questions from a dozen employees, review 
a critical proposal from my top manager, send my sales team an updated 
status report, and forward a couple of resumes to the HR people — all with-
out lifting my fingers from my keyboard.
Indeed, the e-mail explosion has been one of the most significant advances in the 
world of work in the twenty-first century. The speed with which e-mail communi-
cates and the breadth of its reach, the efficiency in the ability to store, respond, 
forward, copy, follow up, and conduct business online is beyond momentous.
 
But for all its advantages, e-mail is often misused in ways that result in ineffi-
ciencies, misunderstandings, and added time. Be sure the message is right for 
e-mail; some subjects are better handled by phone or face-to-face, where you 
can gauge responses as you’re delivering the message and add information 
through tone of voice and/or body language. E-mail is ideal for the following:
 
 In straightforward situations that require a simple, direct response
 
 When you need a written record of communication
 
 When the recipient needs to see attached documents, reports, and articles
 
 When you need to forward information to multiple parties 
 
 When you’re unable to reach a person by phone
 
 When dealing with non-English-speaking people who have heavy accents 
that diminish understanding
 
 When the person you need to speak with is long-winded
 
 When time differences are an issue
I have clients in the Middle East and Asia, which means that while I’m busy 
working, they’re either done with their workday or sound asleep. E-mail allows 
me to keep our business deals flowing without getting up really early or staying 
up late. I send off my queries to them and get their replies the next morning.
 
E-mail can be particularly dangerous in situations where your response is 
strong or emotional. Who hasn’t received an e-mail or voice message that 
riled them up to the point of pounding out a ferocious e-mail response? In 
most cases, this situation only ends badly. The blessings of e-mail can also 
be its curse: Its immediacy gives little time to reflect and process. Never send 

128
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
an e-mail when you’re still angry, whether to your colleague, vendor, boss, or 
political representative. Give yourself adequate time to completely calm down 
before shooting off an emotional message.
That said, I’m all for using the process of writing an e-mail to work through 
anger. The exercise helps you work off some of that emotional energy and 
serves to clear your head and think through your reaction and response. 
But where I put a stop to it is in clicking the Send button. Go ahead and write 
your e-mail response — I suggest you do it offline so you don’t inadvertently 
send — and then park it in your draft folder until you cool down some. If you 
reread it the next day and still feel justified, go ahead and send. But if you 
review and blush at your vitriol, you’re saved the embarrassment of having 
to apologize for your outburst.
Basic Communication Skills: Being 
Direct and Succinct
Your high school English teacher was right when she told you that length and 
quality aren’t necessarily synonymous. Just because someone’s lips move and 
sound emerges doesn’t mean communication is taking place. To ensure that 
your audience fully receives your message, invest time upfront crafting your cor-
respondence. Plan out questions, presentations, and even short conversations.
For impact, build your message with as few words as possible while still get-
ting your meaning across. Keep the message short, sweet, and to the point. 
This section tells you how.
Cutting out the clutter in your language
Many people are uncomfortable about following a direct approach, so they 
fluff out their communications with superfluous information or wrap the 
salient points in a veil of irrelevant niceties. The problem with this fluff is that 
it extends meetings and phone calls, confuses important issues, and turns a 
fellow employee’s quick stop by your cubicle into a 25-minute tale about how 
the weather rained out her kids’ soccer game last night. You don’t have to do 
away with social pleasantries — in fact, you shouldn’t — but remember what 
you’re trying to accomplish and what your time frames are. Gab is only as 
useful as it is meaningful.
 
Being direct doesn’t mean being curt, cold, or negatively opinionated — it 
means that you’re clear, concise, and professional; and that you convey a 
constructive and supportive tone, not a confrontational one. The distinction 
sounds subtle, but it matters greatly when you’re aiming for the most time-
effective response.

129
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
 
Don’t try to impress others with your use of obscure words, phrases, and 
unnecessary technical jargon — it only blocks communication and wastes 
time. The result is confusion, hesitation, misunderstandings, and alienation 
from the receiver. Hearers may become quiet because they don’t want to 
admit they don’t know the meaning of the words you’re using. Using simple 
and straightforward language to communicate complex ideas will make you 
look smarter and more gracious every time.
Including the essential stuff
 
To maximize your time (and everyone else’s), shoot for a succinct message but 
don’t sacrifice crucial information in the interest of brevity. Ask yourself these 
questions as you craft your message: Who are you giving information to? What 
E-mail: A little less conversation
Research shows that the nonverbal methods of 
communication are far more important to the 
message you put out than the words you use. 
Consider these stats (and check out the fol-
lowing figure for a visual of the communication 
breakdown):
  The words you choose deliver 7 percent of 
your message.
  Your tone of voice delivers 38 percent of 
your message. 
  Your body language delivers the remaining 
55 percent of your message.

When you communicate via e-mail, you lose the 
38 percent of your communication that’s trans-
mitted by your tone of voice during a face-to-
face conversation; and you lose an additional 55 
percent of your message because your recipi-
ent can’t see your body language — and you 
can’t see your recipient’s. Compared to face-to-
face communication, e-mail shortchanges you 
of 93 percent of your total communication! The 
7 percent that’s left is totally dependent on the 
effectiveness of the words you select.

130
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
is important for this person to know? Then answer those questions — and 
don’t be afraid to ask others whether you’ve missed anything. When you 
communicate directly, you let people know
 
 What situation you’re facing
 
 What you want or need
 
 What you expect the receiver to do and what the standards of 
measurement are
 
 What the time line is
Notice how the following statements improve by adding this specific 
information:
 
 “As a company, it looks like we need to do a little better.” (Compare: “Our 
goal is to improve corporate results by 6 percent by the end of the third 
quarter.”)
 
 “You all know what you have to do, so go out and do it!” (Compare: “Let’s 
work together to cut travel expenses in each of our areas by 2 percent by 
year-end.”)
 
 “There’s a lot to be said for making our goal.” (Compare: “We outdid our-
selves this year. We exceeded our goal by 7 percent! Let’s see if we can 
exceed our goal by 9 percent by next year. If we do, you’ll all earn a 3 per-
cent bonus!”) (Now, that’s communicating!)
Just saying no
One of the most crucial parts of being direct 
(and managing your time well) is saying no 
when you need to (and when doing so is appro-
priate). If you’re swamped at work, for example, 
and someone asks you to volunteer to decorate 
the office for the holidays or to serve on the 
Thanksgiving celebration committee, the best 
response you can give is, “I’d really like to help, 
but maybe next year. I’m seriously under the 
gun right now to finish Project X. But please ask 
me again next year.”
If a simple no would put you in bad favor, such 
as when your supervisor asks you to take a side 
project that you don’t have time for, ask your 
supervisor for help in reprioritizing your work so 
you can make the deadline instead of respond-
ing with a flat, “No way. I have too much to do.” 
That way, your boss sees your commitment to 
getting the job done, but she also knows that 
you’re realistic with your time commitments and 
value your own well-being enough to set some 
boundaries.

131
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
Fostering Camaraderie When 
Meeting in Person
Almost all business situations — whether one-on-one conversations or group 
meetings — benefit from a beginning that’s dedicated to creating or strength-
ening relationships. That’s simply good business. Teamwork is what makes 
the business world go ’round, and good teamwork is built on positive interac-
tions with colleagues, clients, and co-workers.
Use a little small talk to get people comfortable with each other and prime 
them for conversation. Some safe starters for any meeting or conversation 
include the following phrases:
 
 “How was your trip?”
 
 “Did you have any trouble finding our offices?”
 
 “Is it still raining (snowing, sleeting, hailing, hot, cold) out there?” (I know — 
everyone always talks about the weather, but that’s because the weather 
always provides a safe opening gambit!)
I advise only a few minutes of conversation starters.
 
Use small talk only with people who have some sort of relationship with you — a 
current customer, client, employee, or friend. Don’t ever use them with someone 
new. If you use these conversation starters with new sales prospects, for exam-
ple, all they can think of may be “salesperson and what is he selling?” Not exactly 
the opening that you want to project!
During your conversation, read others and take your cue from their behavior. 
For example, avoid pursuing personal information if the other person is obvi-
ously uncomfortable. It’s okay to let people be themselves — after all, you’re 
working for positive relationships, which mean different things to different 
people.
Be sure that your body language is inviting and open. Smiling can warm up 
the communication with the other person.

132
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Corresponding Clearly and 
Confidently via Telephone
 
Obviously, body language isn’t front and center when your conversation is via 
telephone, but you do need to keep in mind how your body language affects 
your tone of voice and ability to focus and convey a sense of energy. Here are 
some options that can help you project your body language into the telephone 
conversation:
 
 Use a headset. A phone headset offers a number of advantages:
 
• It reduces fatigue because you aren’t holding a phone to your ear. 
 
• It allows you to stand and move your body while you communicate. 
 
• It leaves you free to take notes and record important information 
that you can review later.
 
 Warning: Do not get the cheapest headset you can find. Inexpensive 
headsets usually have such poor sound quality that the person on the 
other end can’t hear you clearly. This defeats your purpose. Spend what 
it takes — possibly a few hundred dollars — to get a headset of suffi-
cient quality. 
 
 Smile. A smile will help your attitude and the delivery of what you’re 
saying.
 
 Stand up during the conversation. Standing up helps you to use your 
body language to reinforce what you’re saying. The listener can’t see 
you, but when you’re standing, more energy flows through the phone. 
You have more confidence and conviction, which make their way into 
your voice. If you really can’t stand up, at least sit on the front edge of 
your chair with your back straight and shoulders back.
 
If the person you’re trying to reach can’t or won’t take your call, you can get a 
lot of information from assistants and front-desk people by asking questions — 
reconnaissance can help you make a sale or get the info you need later on. You 
may also consider dialing the wrong number — either one higher or lower than 
the number of the person you’re trying to reach; if you reach a person who will 
internally transfer you, the person you want to reach may be more likely to 
pick up the phone.
If you get voice mail, don’t give up and send an e-mail. Leave a message so the 
listener gains the full effect of hearing your voice. Properly used, voice mail can 
stand in for a personal visit from you in a lot less time. You can easily come up 
with a basic voice mail template you can customize, especially when you have 
enough insider information to tailor it to your recipient. Here are some guide-
lines for a productive working relationship with voice mail:

133
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
 
 Keep your messages to 15 to 30 seconds.
 
 Be prepared. Have a script in hand; if you stumble, mumble, and bumble 
your message, you’re worse off than if you leave no message.
 
 Launch the call by identifying yourself. State your name, company, title, 
and phone number.
 
 Because of the unreliable reception quality of voice mail, speak with 
greater clarity. Relay information slowly and carefully.
 
 If a recipient has to replay a message several times to decipher it, he or 
she probably won’t. This is especially true when leaving your telephone 
number. You must speak it slowly and at least twice. You know your 
phone number by heart, but the recipient doesn’t!
 
 Ramp up your energy level to deliver your message with passion and 
enthusiasm. (If you sound like a sleep-aid commercial, delete and 
repeat!)
 
 Smile when you leave voice mail messages. Even if it’s the 50th message 
you’ve left today, don’t let your recipient know it.
 
 Take advantage of voice mail features, such as replay and re-record 
functions.
Writing Effective E-mails
The advent of e-mail has forced everyone to focus on keeping communica-
tions brief, if only because so many people dislike writing and typing. That’s 
all good. But as short and straightforward as e-mail messages seem to be, 
they’re also dangerously deceptive and easy to misinterpret. Studies indicate 
that more than 50 percent of those who use e-mail say their business corre-
spondence is misunderstood.
There’s no getting around it: E-mail often leads to misunderstandings. For 
instance, a message from your boss may translate as curt or even displeased 
to you, when in reality he or she was simply rushed. A remark that would 
pass as playful humor in person can come across as an insult in writing.
In this section, I explain how to write a clear, effective e-mail that minimizes 
the potential for misinterpretation.
Crafting a clear and targeted subject line
Your Aunt Edna, of course, always opens your e-mails, with or without a sub-
ject line. But a potential customer or business contact is flooded with mes-
sages from advertisers and with other highly expendable e-mail. You have 

134
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
between 25 and 35 characters to persuade the recipient to move your corre-
spondence from the B pile (or the delete file) to the A pile. Make your e-mail 
a keeper by tagging it with a standout subject line after you write the body of 
the e-mail. Pull out a phrase or series of words that sums up the message.
 
As you decide what to write in the subject line, keep in mind that this line has 
two purposes:
 
 To tell the recipient the purpose of your e-mail
 
 To pique the receiver’s interest enough to command attention from the 
slew of e-mail he or she is sifting through
In sales and marketing, one tactic I employ is to use a page-turner subject line: an 
unfinished thought that can be completed when the recipient opens the e-mail:
 
 “Just one week until . . .”
 
 “Our clients have increased sales by 84%”
 
 “Don’t miss this tremendous . . .”
 
Spam software programs identify some key words and phrases and block any 
e-mail containing those words in the subject line. Steer clear of the following 
words and phrases (and their relatives):
 
 Incredible
 
 Free
 
 Limited time only
 
 Money
 
 A friend gave me your e-mail address
Keeping an eye on composition
The subject line gets readers to open the e-mail, but as with people, wine, 
and birthday presents, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. Here are some 
tips for composing the body of your e-mail.
Looking at structure and length
E-mails are most effective when they’re short and to the point. If recipients 
have to scroll, the odds increase that they’ll miss some of the information 
toward the end or feel so overwhelmed that reading your missive is a task 
they shift to the back burner. That’s why many experts suggest that e-mail 

135
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
messages should be about four paragraphs long or less — definitely no 
longer than a screen full. If you find you have more to say than will fit on the 
screen, consider these alternatives:
 
 Use another mode of communication.
 
 Send the message as an attachment, including a paragraph of 
explanation within the e-mail.
 
If you know for certain that you must include all information in the body of an 
e-mail and that you need more than four paragraphs to house it all, remember 
that the first and last paragraphs carry the most punch. To make effective use 
of your presentation, follow these rules of thumb:
 
 Be sure that the most important information is in the top part of the 
e-mail.
 
 Include a call to action earlier in the e-mail rather than at the end, where 
it typically goes. The reader may not make it to the last paragraph.
 
 When you receive an e-mail that warrants forwarding — or one that you 
want to copy someone else on — delete the trailing chain of discussion 
so only the issue at hand remains.
 
 Use bullet points rather than narrative to call out the critical points for 
the reader.
 
What if you’re on the receiving end of a litany of questions in e-mail form? 
Simple: Hit Reply (with history) and craft a short paragraph that explains that 
your responses are found below. Then respond right after each individual 
question — within the original message — in a professional but standout color 
so the original sender clearly and easily sees your responses. I frequently 
use red, blue, or black for my color — and if need be, green. This setup helps 
senders avoid scrolling up and down from their question to your responses.
Maintaining a professional level of formality
Because of their immediate nature, e-mail tends toward the informal. Between 
friends and family, dispensing with punctuation, salutations, and even correct 
spelling may be acceptable. But in the world of business, it’s a huge no-no.
 
Although you may have congenial enough relationships with co-workers and 
even some clients, my advice is to keep all business correspondence formal. 
These messages reflect on your professionalism and may end up printed out 
and passed around or forwarded to other businesspeople. Just like dressing 
for a job interview, it never hurts to keep it formal.

Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Treat an e-mail the same as you would a paper letter, and follow these tips to 
maintain your professional appearance: 
 
 Use conventional salutations and closings: Dear ___, Hello ___ and Best 
regards, Sincerely, or the like.
 
 Don’t assume your recipient knows lingo or abbreviations common in 
text messages and online chats — leave them out. Abbreviations, single 
letters, and misspelled characters may only confuse recipients to the 
point they ignore the message.
 
 Steer clear of emoticons, those sideways facial expressions created from 
punctuation keys :-P.
 
 Keep vernacular and slang out of the e-mail.
 
 Don’t use all capital letters. In e-mail vernacular, capital letters indicate 
shouting. True, the recipient doesn’t hear you shout, but it’s difficult to 
read long tracts of copy in uppercase.
 
 Always close with your name, as if you were actually signing a letter.
 
 Run spell-check.
Reviewing your writing
E-mail produces copies of your writing that you usually can’t retrieve after 
you send it into cyberspace, so make sure everything you write is exactly 
as it should be. To ensure that you don’t accidentally overlook any errors 
or omissions and that you’ll get the response you’re seeking (if any), follow 
these bits of advice:
 
 Allow yourself time to put written communication aside; then come 
back to it to see it as a first-time reader would. E-mail is a lot like a 
tennis match, with the Reply button serving as the ball. It’s a good idea 
to take that button out of the game and allow a little more reflection. 
Have you covered everything that needs to be covered? Time spent 
upfront, honing your communications, can save you more “expensive” 
time later in the project. As for your own e-mail messages, try putting 
them in the draft box and come back to them later. This can help you 
catch any language that comes off as snippy, short, abrupt, or offensive.
 
 If you’re in a rush to get out a lot of correspondence, go ahead and whip 
through them all at once. But stick them the draft box and return to 
each with fresh eyes before launching them. 
 
 Have a co-worker — preferably someone not involved with the project — 
look over your memos and e-mail. Are there unanswered questions?

137
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
 
 Proofread your e-mail for spelling and grammar errors by using spell-
check and reading through your e-mail one last time before sending 
it. Making typos and grammatical errors is common in e-mail, primarily 
because the communication is so fast and immediate. Again, in a busi-
ness environment, you want your correspondence to reflect your high 
level of professionalism. Although you may not get a pay cut for mis-
spelling a few words, others may note your lack of attention.
Preparing for the send-off
Before you hit that Send button, review your recipients and give your send-
ing options one last review:
 
 Give the urgent-message flag a rest. Avoid the boy-who-cried-wolf syn-
drome: When every single message you send is marked urgent, well, you 
know what happens. Don’t use the flag unless you need a response in 24 
hours or less.
 
 Don’t overuse the carbon copy (Cc) function. If you need to include 
others, terrific, but keep the list of Cc’s only to the people who really 
need to know. If someone has only peripheral interest in the discussion, 
leave that person off.
 
 Use the blind carbon copy (Bcc) for large e-mail sends. The advantage 
of Bcc is that you’re not sharing your list of contacts. With the explosion 
of spam, everyone needs to protect privacy, and people who have your 
address have that obligation as well. By using the Bcc feature, no one 
other than you knows who has received your correspondence.
 
 Mark it private. With most corporate e-mail systems in companies, 
you’re able to send an e-mail privately. If the message is confidential or 
sensitive, be sure to make it private — for the recipient’s eyes and your 
eyes only. Ask the IT department in your company how you can send 
private e-mail throughout your division or department.
Asking Targeted Questions to Get Results
The key to finding out what you need to know more quickly is asking the 
right questions. No matter what your job is, good questions direct your com-
munication through the veritable maze of issues, challenges, and distractions 
that pop up whenever two or more people get together to exchange informa-
tion and solve problems.

138
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
When you pose strategic questions, you guide the conversation to make the 
most of the time spent. You also gain insight that influences how effectively 
you can move forward. Don’t be afraid to ask as many questions as necessary 
to completely understand the situation. And don’t stop asking until you have 
a clear picture of what’s expected.
Maybe you learned as a child that asking too many questions was impolite or 
intrusive. Not in business situations! By focusing on other people and keep-
ing them talking, you gather more information — information that can make 
you more effective. If, for example, you’re in sales, ask questions that center 
around the prospect’s DNA2: desire, need, ability, and authority (see Chapter 
14). To shrink decision time, ask more questions. Before you discuss prod-
ucts, services, or solutions, construct a clear image of who this person is and 
what he or she needs.
Of course, you can’t ask questions willy-nilly and expect to get the informa-
tion you need. You have to ask questions that get results, which I help you do 
in this section.
Determining what sorts 
of answers you need
Whether you’re in management, administration, sales, service, human 
resources, or any other facet of business, preparation is essential. Your com-
munication is far more fruitful if you think it through beforehand. To improve 
your chances of success, envision how you want the conversation to go 
before you initiate it. What’s your ultimate goal? What information do you 
need to do the best job in the least amount of time? What specific questions 
must be answered? What are the potential stumbling blocks or choke points?
Amazingly, many people link organization and advance planning to mechani-
cal communication. But planned is not canned. You expect the pilot who flies 
your plane from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, to be well-prepared before 
take-off, right? You take it for granted that he or she has checkpoints along 
the way. Without proper planning, the plane could end up thousands of miles 
from Sydney because it was a few degrees off at the beginning of the journey. 
It’s just as easy to be off-target in important conversations.
 
There’s a fine line between preparation and creative avoidance, otherwise 
known as procrastination. (See Chapter 10 for more on the topic of procrastina-
tion.) Five or ten minutes is typically plenty of time to organize for an important 
call. If you’re spending a half-hour to an hour preparing for calls or conversa-
tions, chances are you’re putting them off rather than preparing for them.

139
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
Starting the flow with 
open-ended questions
The most valuable questions early in any dialogue are open-ended questions, 
ones that require more than yes-or-no answers. Open-ended questions allow 
you to gather information, thoughts, ideas, observations, opinions, and com-
ments. You reach agreement much more quickly and easily through open-
ended questions. 
 
When you ask open-ended questions, you force dialogue and trigger the flow of 
information. Starting your questions with who, what, where, when, why, and how 
narrows the focus, defines the standards, gives you insight into what others are 
thinking, and outlines expectations. Here are some sample questions:
 
 Who? Who should I consult about this? Who else will be involved in the 
final decision? Whose standard do we need to meet or exceed? Who else 
are you considering for this job or position or project?
 
 What/which? What’s the best way to approach this problem? What new 
product are you offering? What’s the deadline? What are the specific 
standards of performance? What’s my number-one priority? What has 
moved this project to the front burner? Which priorities should I shift to 
accomplish this project? What else should I know about before I begin?
 
 Where? Where should we go from here? Where does this project fit into 
our strategic objectives?
 
 When? When can I expect an answer? When do you want to review the 
first part? When should we meet to review my progress? When are we 
meeting with other key people?
 
 Why? Why do you think this problem keeps recurring? Why is this 
change, project, or new procedure coming up? Why did you give this 
opportunity to me?
 
 How? How can I help you? How does your product compare with other 
products we offer or with other products we’ve offered in the past? How 
will this help you, our department, or the company? How will this help 
me advance? How would you go about tackling this project, challenge, 
or issue?
If you have answers to these questions, you can achieve the desired results 
faster — and ensure that they meet everyone’s expectations. That’s a power-
ful combination: better time management and more successful results.

140
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Narrowing the focus with 
closed-ended questions
Many experts in time management, sales, customer service, and management tell 
you to avoid closed-ended questions. I disagree. A correctly placed closed-ended 
question lets you take a reading: Are you progressing toward your goal? Are you 
moving in the right direction? Are you earning your customer’s business? 
A closed-ended question — one that can be answered with a simple yes or no — 
serves as a temperature gauge that tells you whether to turn up or turn down 
the heat. If you don’t use closed-ended questions to test your progress, all you’re 
doing is gathering more and more information without moving toward a conclu-
sion. (See Chapter 14, on getting customers to make decisions.)
Here are some examples of good close-ended questions:
 
 Is this what you envisioned when you delegated this to me?
 
 Do you believe our product is right for you?
 
 Do I need to run this by anyone else?
 
 Is the timing right for a salary increase?
 
Limited and strategic use of closed-ended questions can save time. However, 
if you don’t follow a closed-ended question with another open-ended one, the 
dialogue often dies there. Follow that yes or no response with another open-
ended question and keep the conversation moving.
Pinning down maybes and other 
conditional responses
Sometimes open- or closed-ended questions need clarification. This is espe-
cially true when you receive not a yes or no but a maybe — what’s known as 
a conditional response.
Maybe is probably the most misunderstood response in the world. Depending 
on your level of optimism, a maybe can mean yes or no. If you’re like Eeyore 
in Winnie the Pooh, you assume the maybe is a no. If you’re a bouncing 
Tigger, you may take maybe for a veiled yes.
In fact, a maybe is a maybe until it’s clarified. To do that, ask simple, direct ques-
tions that elicit a concrete response; if you’re still unclear, ask direct follow-up 
questions until you get the definitive response that you need. The following are 
some examples of questions that can help you pin down “maybe” responses:

141
 Chapter 8: Communicating Strategically to Get Results — Fast
 
 What does that mean exactly?
 
 Under what circumstances do you see yourself using our service?
 
 Under what conditions would you consider ___ for this project? How did 
you arrive at your conclusion?
 
 So if I did ___, would that change your decision to a yes?
 
 Would you ever see yourself giving me that opportunity?
 
 Under what conditions would that be?
Don’t be too quick to rush to take the next step without pinning down the 
maybe first.
Achieving a positive tone
 
No matter where you are in the questioning process, remain positive. 
Negativity can increase the time it takes you to mend gaffes, or it can stop the 
process altogether. A negative approach puts others on the defensive and 
squelches your ability to gather information. Asking positive questions, on 
the other hand, communicates that you anticipate a positive outcome. You’re 
focused on the future, learning from your mistakes, and ensuring that you 
don’t repeat them.
How do you put a positive spin on your questions? Here are some examples:
 
 “What would you like to see improved?” instead of “What didn’t you like 
about ___?”
 
 “What should I have done differently?” or “How could I have done better?” 
instead of “What did I do wrong?”
Preparing to listen
People like to talk about their favorite subjects: themselves. That’s good! 
When people talk about themselves, you glean valuable information about 
them, their business, how they make decisions, what’s important to them, 
their business relationships, their goals, projects, spouses, kids, pets — in 
short, what they think and feel about pretty much everything. You can also 
discover their needs, wants, and desires. What motivates them? If you iden-
tify their challenges, you can create opportunities to help them solve their 
problems. You may even discover new business or career opportunities.

142
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
After you ask questions, remember to actually listen to the responses. If 
you’re talking, you’re not listening; and if you’re not listening, you’re missing 
important information, spending additional time following up by phone and 
e-mail, and frittering away minutes and hours you could use to work on your 
real goals. There’s wisdom in the old adage that you “have two ears and one 
mouth for a reason.” If you listen twice as much as you speak, you reduce the 
time you invest with others to achieve results for them and for yourself. 
Bonus: When you ask questions and engage people by getting them to talk 
about themselves, you’re considered a brilliant conversationalist. If you want 
to get invited to more galas with the movers and shakers in your town, ask 
terrific questions — and really listen to the answers.
What’s my motivation? Getting input 
from your key actors
The point of a dream question is to help some-
one envision a better time and place where 
results are improved, goals are achieved, and 
problems and challenges are reduced. When 
you supervise people, asking dream questions 
gives you unique insight into their motivations 
and goals. The upshot? Connecting their tasks 
to what they want in life can increase their pro-
duction during work hours. Some examples of 
good dream questions include the following:
  Where do you see yourself in five years?
  What are your long-term goals for your 
department?
  What are the most challenging issues you 
see, now and in the future?
  If you could close your eyes and make one 
problem disappear, which would it be?

W
ithin the past two decades, people have embraced communication 
technology. But in many ways, these miracles of convenience have 
robbed workers of their ability to control their own time. Multiplying points 
of access — voice mail, e-mail, instant messaging, audio and video conferenc-
ing, and of course, the cellphone — can shackle you like a house-arrest ankle 
bracelet, sentencing you to a life-term of perpetual availability. Business col-
leagues can track you down on vacation, and friends can interrupt an impor-
tant client presentation. I’m not sure I’d describe this as progress, but it’s 
inarguably a fact of modern life.
Consider this: Every one of these interruptions — no matter how small or 
insignificant — robs you of at least five additional minutes of productive time. 
Whether your spouse calls and talks to you for 30 seconds or 30 minutes, you 
can subtract at least five more minutes from your day. Tally up 20 interrup-
tions over the course of your day, and you lose nearly two hours of produc-
tivity — and that totals to the loss of 36 hours a month!
Distractionitis is the scourge of time-block adherents; the fastest way to 
render a time block or even a day useless is not to deal with distractions well 
(see Chapter 4 for more on time-blocking). So now’s the time to gain con-
trol of the interruption game, whether you’re at risk from wandering bosses 
and colleagues, demanding clients, or the technological tools that can slice 
through your best defenses. I show you how in this chapter.

144
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
The Fortress: Guarding Your 
Focus from Invasion
 
Being successful in time management and adhering to your time-block sched-
ule happens through controlling access: You need to limit the frequency of the 
interruptions you allow. Recognize that I use the word allow here. You’re the 
one who controls your time and allows other people and situations to pull you 
away from your goals, dreams, objectives, and time-blocked schedule. You’re 
in control, and you’re the master of your time.
Think of yourself as the castle guard: Your workplace is a fortress, one that 
must be protected in order for it to remain a happy and productive place. 
Your best strategy is to establish an impenetrable wall between you and 
interruptions. In this section, I explain how to protect yourself from invad-
ers on foot and how to disconnect from the electronic devices that can cut 
through your physical defenses. Finally, you discover how to screen your 
calls so only the essential information gets through.
Protecting your domain 
from walk-in intrusions
The biggest interruptions in your workday frequently come from within. 
Your co-workers pose a great threat to your effective time management. 
What’s doubly scary is that you don’t always recognize your colleagues as 
threats. Hey, these folks are on your team — they’re the good guys, they’re 
there for you! However, it’s important to recognize the signs of danger from 
time-wasting co-workers. If not, you’re at risk of falling to friendly fire.
The modern work environment is often designed on an open-office concept. 
Few if any employees are granted an office with a door, and most workers 
are parked in open cubicles, often with partitions that do little to block views 
(and definitely not the noise) of co-workers. It’s supposed to manifest a more 
unified effort and team spirit, I guess. But it doesn’t do much to protect you 
from your teammates’ intrusions on your time. Unfortunately, the same open-
door philosophy that allows employees to drop in on their supervisors at will 
is often carried throughout the workplace, so co-workers may stop by to talk 
about a mutual project — or the office football pool.
Creating virtual barriers
When you have little in the way of a physical barrier, defending your border 
from invasion becomes a challenge. But it can be done — just because you 
don’t have a door to keep people from entering your space doesn’t mean you 
can’t create virtual barriers when you’re unavailable:

145
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
 
 Communicate subtly through the posting technique. Put signs on your 
office door or cubicle letting others know you’re busy.
 
 The best action you can take is to post a do-not-disturb sign outside 
your cubicle, perhaps indicating the critical project you’re working 
on. Your co-workers and supervisor may be more sympathetic to your 
plight if it’s a project they’re familiar with.
 
 Verbally communicate your schedule to others so they know when 
you’re unavailable for interruptions. I call this communicating the standard. 
For repeat offenders, the posting alone won’t work. You have to explain to 
them verbally and with authority that you don’t have an abundance of time.
 
 Threaten to put them to work. If you’re in sales, for example, inform the 
would-be interrupters that you’re prospecting and that if they interrupt, 
they have to come in and make calls with you. That’ll usually stop any 
salesperson from the interruption because he or she won’t want to join 
you in the prospecting quest.
 
Set your unavailable time for the hours before 11 a.m. It’s uncanny, but the 
world seems to start delivering problems to your doorstep just before midday. 
I’ve dubbed this phenomenon the 11 a.m. Rule. If you set your “closed” hours 
prior to 11 a.m., you can get your important stuff done before you start to hear 
the buzz of trouble brewing outside your cubicle wall.
Scheduling time to manage and interact with your staff
If you’re a manager, you walk a fine line: It’s important to be available to staff to 
address issues and offer encouragement, but a manager who loses control of the 
border may discover that the flow of employee communication is akin to a circus 
parade with a never-ending line of elephants connected by trunks and tails.
Fortunately, you have a few additional ways to keep those elephant invasion 
forces at bay, preventing in-person interruptions while maintaining your role as a 
teamwork facilitator and employee go-to resource. Both management techniques 
center on blocking time in your schedule to interact with staff so you put con-
straints on the open-door policy. Creating specific time blocks to interact with 
the staff allows you to shut your door and focus a greater percentage of the day 
so you follow your schedule more readily. The times before and after lunch — 
when you’re likely between projects — are excellent for open-door hours.
Here are some options on how to approach this scheduled time for interaction:
 
 Making the rounds: A popular preemptive tactic that managers have fol-
lowed since the first workplace self-help books came out, management 
by walking around, puts the time control back in the manager’s domain. 
It suggests that making the rounds on a scheduled basis allows you to 
establish your availability and deflect those interruptions that could oth-
erwise come later. Instead of getting snagged on the way to get a cup of 
coffee, you proactively seek out your staff, asking how their projects are 
going or whether they have any concerns or issues you can help with.

146
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
 Setting your rounds for the morning is a sound strategy, though it’s a 
good idea to wait until everyone gets settled in at their desks and the 
caffeine kicks in so they can respond to your “How’s that proposal 
coming?” with some clarity.
 
 Having employees come to you: Establish your scheduled interaction 
time as open-office time for staff to drop in. Or require employees to 
make appointments to meet with you during that time.
 
 One danger in setting up specific drop-in hours is that it puts you in 
a state of waiting. You may not get any takers of your time, but your 
ability to focus on any other work is more challenged because you’re 
expecting to be interrupted at any moment. To avoid this, I’ve imple-
mented scheduled-appointment hours in my office. I still set aside the 
same time block to be available to my staff, but I insist that they make 
appointments. They can’t just stop in without notice.
 
 You can require whatever advance notice you’re comfortable with — 15 
minutes or 15 hours. That way, if some of the time goes unbooked, you 
can schedule something else in that slot. You can choose to limit these 
appointments in length — 15 minutes, a half-hour — and you can require 
that employees explain what they want to talk about when they schedule 
so you can be prepared.
See Chapter 18 for more guidance if your job involves managing others.
Scheduling time offline
Used effectively, the telephone and e-mail can enhance performance, increase 
productivity, boost profitability, and expedite career growth. But there’s a flip-
side: Because modern communication allows for easier interruptions, it creates 
a greater loss of production, performance, profitability, and advancement than 
ever before. And to a certain extent, e-mail has taken many people hostage. 
Do you feel compelled to open all e-mail immediately? Do you jump on to the 
next e-mail even before you’ve responded to or resolved the previous e-mail? 
Just as with cellphones, the fact that you can be reached easily and at any time 
seems to dictate that you must be available to anyone — all the time.
 
When you stop to open each and every e-mail as soon as it arrives or answer the 
phone every time it rings, you are, in essence, multitasking, trying to perform one 
or more tasks simultaneously. And as I frequently point out, multitasking is just 
not time-efficient.
 
To keep your focus, set aside time — daily or several times per week — during 
which you simply do not take calls, check e-mail, or allow other interruptions. 
Such prescheduled segments ensure blocks of concentration, a tactic certain 

147
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
to raise productivity and lower frustration. If you’re concerned about being 
unavailable for too long of a time, then limit these periods to one or one and a 
half hours, with time afterward to return messages.
Letting e-mail wait in your inbox
I am a firm believer in working offline. There’s no way I can resist the temp-
tation to check my e-mail every time my computer tells me a message has 
arrived. During your offline time, turn off your e-mail notice or disconnect from 
the Internet. Schedule your e-mail time and devote a reasonable time block to 
take care of it. Then turn your e-mail program off so you don’t see the you’ve-
got-mail icon on your computer until your next scheduled e-mail session.
Or compose all your own e-mail correspondence in your word processing 
program, and when you’ve completed, reviewed, tweaked, polished, and 
made sure each message says exactly what you want, you can go online 
and send those e-mail messages off. If you compose your e-mail in a word 
processing program, you gain yet another advantage: This tactic serves as a 
safety precaution — you won’t inadvertently shoot off a critical e-mail before 
you’re completely satisfied with it; no more “recalls.”
 
The toughest decision you may face is whether to check your e-mail first 
thing in the morning when you fire up your computer. Wait and knock out a 
few priorities first? Or open it up and relieve the suspense — and possibly 
get waylaid by some marauding issue you feel compelled to pursue? It’s your 
choice — do what works best for you. But by staying offline for the bulk of 
your workday, you’re likely to stay focused on the tasks at hand and get 
much more accomplished.
Stopping the ringing in your ears
Let your voice mail or assistant take phone messages. Voice mail is your not-
so-secret weapon for dodging phone interruptions and taking back your time. 
If your system has a do-not-disturb button, push it or put your ringer on mute 
and you won’t be tempted to ponder who called. If you’re an executive, for-
ward the calls to your assistant for a time or ask the receptionist to let your 
callers know that you’re in an appointment and will call them back.
Additionally, give yourself times when you turn off your cellphone. The 
most brilliant innovation with these amazing devices? You can turn them 
off! Without missing a message, you can continue with your conversation, 
errand, or work without distraction and get back to the call when you’re 
through. Of course, you may already protect yourself against uninvited 
interruptions by limiting who you give your cell number to. But unless 
you’re awaiting an urgent call from your kids, your boss, or the state lottery 
commission, you can likely afford a period of off-time while you attend to 
important tasks that require your full concentration.

148
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Screening interruptions before 
letting them through
You may need to make sure certain types of information can get through to you, 
even while your barriers shut out everything else. The solution is to screen your 
calls using caller ID or to have your assistant screen your calls for you.
If you’re the boss, you’re the wizard who turns business transactions into 
gold, and your assistant or receptionist operates the drawbridge, keeping 
out those who attempt to foil your efforts. Your administrative staff needs to 
adopt the gatekeeper philosophy. The first step is set your business up as a 
fortress, making it hard to get in to see the royalty — you.
The administrative staff has total control of the drawbridge that grants 
access to the fortress. They should have a militant approach to allowing 
people access to you. You need to clearly identify to your staff who is to be 
granted access and who is not. Only a few people should pass easily through 
the gate; the rest should be screened thoroughly to see whether another 
team member can assist them first.
Arm gatekeepers with the tools necessary to identify and keep out intruders 
and the knowledge to recognize whom to lower the drawbridge for. Their 
role in managing access is instrumental to your productivity and that of the 
department. A properly armed assistant is able to
 
 Answer most questions from callers and eliminate the need to talk to you
 
 Capture enough information so that you’re prepared with a response, 
which means a shorter interaction when you do get back to the individual
 
 Schedule an appointment for you
 
 Know which issues or requests require your immediate attention
 
 Take messages from people who must talk with you
 
Taking a message is more than just noting the caller’s name, phone number, 
date, and time of the call. A highly trained assistant finds out the specific reason 
for the call and tries to handle the question right there on the spot. This is one of 
the biggest time-saving techniques of all. If unable to handle the situation on the 
initial call, the assistant finds out the answer and then returns the call.
If it’s absolutely necessary for you to speak to the caller, set a specific time 
when you’ll return the call, effectively making a mini-appointment for the 
return telephone call.

149
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
Those who don’t have a loyal staff can turn to technology. What a miraculous 
invention, caller ID! By glancing at the phone number ID on your receiver, you 
can determine in a second whether it’s a call you want to take. Not only is 
caller ID helpful for screening out unsolicited telemarketing calls, but you can 
also use it to determine whether a call is critical to take now. And at work, 
if you’re on a roll on that big proposal and you’d only take a call from your 
boss, your phone helps you make that decision.
If you’re working from home, you face some unique challenges in handling 
phone calls (they don’t call it telecommuting for nothing!). Not only do you 
have to contend with more calls from the office (if you were there, you could 
at least put up a do-not-disturb sign on your door), but you also catch all the 
solicitation calls you’d miss if you were out of the house during the day. Plus 
there’s a strange phenomenon at work for telecommuters: Both friends and 
business contacts seem to feel more comfortable interrupting your workday 
when you work from home.
 
Caller ID for telecommuters is even more effective if you have two separate 
lines, one for work and one for personal calls. That way, you can tell by the 
ring which is which. When you’re “at work,” you can choose to disregard the 
personal line — and if you’re sitting down to a family dinner, you can ignore 
your work line with a clear conscience. Only my work number rings into my 
home office. I can’t hear our personal residence line, so it doesn’t distract me. 
A second phone line is a small monthly investment that helps me manage my 
time and increase my productivity.
Limiting phone interruptions from loved ones
In some cases, family calls are the primary 
source of telephone interruptions. Have a frank 
talk with your family members about when it’s 
appropriate to call you at work.
If you have young children, you know how 
they want to tell you all the cool things that 
happened during the course of their day, well 
before family dinnertime. You likely expect and 
welcome these calls. Certainly you want to set 
opportunities for them to reach you, but it’s 
good to establish boundaries at the same time. 
You may, for example, ask your kids to call you 
and fill you in on their day at a certain time — 
say, after they get home from school or in the 
case of preschoolers, after lunchtime. Same 
goes for your spouse or partner.
Warning: Most job environments allow for 
some personal-call time, but few are tolerant 
of employees who receive calls throughout 
the day. That type of phone interruption can 
undermine your productivity, not to mention 
your career. At work, you really don’t need the 
kinds of emotional distractions that’ll dramati-
cally affect your performance and productivity 
for the next thirty minutes, an hour, or even the 
rest of the day. Calls from family can move your 
mind to home even though your body is still at 
the office.

Secondary Defenses: Minimizing Damage 
When Calls Get Through
If you set up the defense mechanisms and blocking techniques I cover 
throughout this chapter, you can avoid more than 90 percent of the inter-
ruptions that most people experience each day. But no matter the system or 
strategy you use to protect yourself, telephone interruptions are certain to 
penetrate your defenses. When this happens, your best strategy is to accept 
it and go with the flow. Okay, so an interruption slipped past your perimeter: 
Instead of expending effort to repel the breach, just deal with it. A negative 
attitude or reaction is likely to cause more damage and waste more time than 
simply resolving the matter that made its way to you.
The most effective technique to help you adhere to time-blocking is to plan 
for the distractions that’ll undoubtedly come. You may use the preemptive 
strike technique, which allows you to deal with distractions from others on 
your terms. In this section, you discover a few plans for handling the phone 
calls that make it through to you.
Delegating the responsibility
When the call penetrates your defenses, attempt to delegate the call to someone 
who can handle it for you. Inform the caller that you’re booked, buried, under a 
deadline, committed, or heading into a meeting — and that you’re shifting the 
responsibility for the call as the fastest way to resolve the problem or challenge. 
Assure the caller that you’re bringing in someone qualified to help.
 
You also convey a strong reassurance when you explain that the other person 
is better equipped to resolve the situation. Often, especially if you’re the boss, 
clients and business contacts want to talk to you. When you confess that you 
aren’t the best person to fulfill the request, you’re more likely to gain the call-
er’s confidence that you have his or her best interests in mind.
Shortening or condensing the conversation
When a call does sneak past the fortress guard, your best defense is to bring 
that call to a close as quickly as possible. Your focus has been broken, and it’ll 
require five minutes from the point you wrap up the call to regain your momen-
tum. You want to keep the conversation short so you can get back in the groove.

151
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
Inform the caller upfront how much time you can offer. You may, for exam-
ple, explain that you’re in the middle of an important project and have only 
ten minutes available. You can also plead an appointment — and if you’ve 
implemented the time-block schedule (see Chapter 4), you’ve blocked out 
your day, so your claim is true.
Some people feel uncomfortable about cutting calls short in this way, espe-
cially with clients or prospective customers. Giving the caller a time limit 
feels abrupt. But it doesn’t have to. Here’s one way your speech may go:
“I know we can resolve your problem, but I have an appointment in ten minutes 
that I have to keep. If we can’t resolve the problem to your satisfaction in the ten 
minutes, then we can set a time to talk later today to finish up.”
This approach still gets you off the phone in the allotted time but gives you 
an out. The customer can also feel better that you’re offering more time. I’ve 
used this technique for years with high-maintenance clients. Rarely do we 
need the additional conversation, but they appreciate my offer all the same.
Rebooking discussions for a better time
 
If now’s a bad time to handle the call, then reschedule. The caller certainly 
doesn’t know your schedule, and it probably never occurred to the caller 
that this could be a bad time. Offer a brief explanation — you’re in a meeting, 
on your way to an appointment, or simply tied up at this time. Then without 
allowing time for a response, offer two options of when you’re available:
“I’m not able to give your situation the full attention it deserves at this 
moment. Can we schedule a phone meeting for this afternoon after three or 
first thing tomorrow morning?”
By offering options, you give back some control to the caller. If you’ve been 
caught without your day planner, give a general time, such as Wednesday 
morning or Thursday afternoon. Then don’t forget to transfer the call 
appointment to your planner.
Handling Recurring Interruptions 
by Co-workers
Being very clear on your personal boundaries is essential with your co-workers. 
However, there’s a fine balance between being viewed as a hermit, loner, or out-
cast and conveying your commitment to your job and the deadlines that you’ve 
been given, so you have to approach the confrontation with finesse.

152
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
Especially if the interruption outbreak is a department-wide epidemic, sug-
gest to your supervisor that the team get together to talk about solutions. By 
coming together as a department or work group, each individual is more likely 
to take ownership of the situation. Call a team meeting to discuss workflow, 
distractions, and interruptions. As a group, you can brainstorm solutions and 
come up with a strategy that everyone can buy into. Because you’re all making 
a commitment in each other’s presence, everyone is more likely to honor it.
Time-wasting co-workers fall into a few categories, each of which can cause 
you interruptions that are detrimental to your career. You first have to figure 
out which category the offender falls into so you can respond in a way that’ll 
effectively remedy the specific situation. In this section, I preview four of the 
most common colleague categories and some signs to watch out for. These 
individuals may be hard workers, possibly overburdened, and very produc-
tive. Unfortunately, they sap a lot of their productivity from their co-workers, 
often disrupting others in the office to seek assistance, whether it’s emo-
tional support or actually trying to pass off specific tasks.
The colleague with nothing to do
Face it: In most companies, the division of labor is rarely parceled out equally — 
not fair, maybe, but it’s a fact of life. For you to survive with your time intact, you 
need to recognize who’s not carrying his or her share of the work. Why? Because 
to add insult to injury, these are often the same people who sabotage the efforts 
of those who do the bulk of the work by interrupting their productivity. These 
folks often pop into your space, flop into a chair, and strike up a conversation 
about anything and everything.
 
If you get interrupted by someone who clearly doesn’t have enough to do, ask 
her what she’s working on. What are her priorities and deadlines? Inform her 
of yours and ask for her help. Asking offenders to help or to work sends most 
of them the other direction to their own cubicles — voila!
The colleague who just 
doesn’t want to work
I may be in the minority on this view, but I think people who waste time on 
their company’s dollar are stealing a portion of their paycheck from their 
company. Workers owe the company that pays their salaries and benefits 
their best efforts for the whole time they’re working. The people who lumber 
along, encourage others to waste time, take two-hour lunches, and generally 
don’t give their best effort have a character flaw. The problem is that you 
can’t help these individuals a whole lot. Your boss needs to be the one to lay 
down the law.

153
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
 
Make sure your own responsibilities aren’t at risk. In time management terms, 
give a few minutes, and someone will take an hour. That means you can’t 
sugar coat the issue with co-workers. You have to be direct and firm, noting 
(with a smile) that you don’t have time for frivolity. Better to confront your co-
worker than miss a deadline and be viewed as not trustworthy of performance 
under pressure. Don’t allow someone else’s agenda to diminish you in the 
eyes of your boss.
If all else fails, go to your boss for help. If the time-waster is influencing your 
performance, then your boss will want to know. Be careful not to create a link 
between your frustration in telling the lazy co-worker she’s lazy and talking 
to the boss. Give yourself a few days between each discussion so you reduce 
the chance of backlash.
The employee who’s wrapped 
up in his world
Some people are excited about everything in life, especially their family and 
outside interests. They’re constantly talking about their weekend, their date 
last night, their favorite team, and their family ad nauseam. Their focus is so 
scattered and their excitement is so high that they’re almost like a Dalmatian 
jumping at your feet for attention. The real challenge is that like a Dalmatian, 
they don’t get the subtle hints you drop that you’re busy. It’s as if you have 
to hold them still, bring your face to theirs, and say, “I am busy!” nose to 
nose. Be direct.
The person who treats work 
as her sole social outlet
Some people have such a limited life outside of work that they want to know 
all about yours. They live vicariously through your life experiences, from 
dating to family to your weekends past or future. Short of being their dating 
or activity secretary, you need to limit the interaction. The lunch hour is usu-
ally a bad option for talking with these people because it can wipe out time 
before and after lunch as well as lower productivity, but if you want to help 
them get their life in order after work, go for it.

154
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Dealing with Interruption-Oriented 
Bosses
In most companies, probably the biggest offenders who interrupt the staff are 
people in supervisory positions. In some ways, this is understandable. These 
folks are presumed to have an inside track on corporate priorities and often 
have to call upon staff to change gears and redirect their efforts. It’s no sur-
prise when the director whips into your cubicle, announcing that you’ve just 
been tagged to take on the company’s latest and greatest new program — 
and you’re to put anything else on the back burner. However, that’s a far cry 
from the boss who sidles into your guest chair and launches an hour rant on 
executive office demands, reduced budget, and upcoming weekend plans. Or 
the one who drops in every 15 minutes to ask you how you’re coming on that 
report that’s due in three hours.
 
Most bosses aren’t out to find ways to deliberately disrupt their employees’ 
work. More than likely, they’re focused on their goals — whether those goals 
are meeting sales quotas, completing a project on time, reducing costs, or 
maintaining production. And in their quest to meet those goals, they’re often 
simply not sensitive to others’ need for focus.
Enlisting the cooperation of your direct supervisor can be a bit touchier than 
confronting a co-worker with your interruption issues. It may take some more 
diplomacy and tact, but it can and must be done. Meeting with your boss to 
discuss your time-block schedule or to ask your boss to help you with your 
schedule is a good opening salvo. Get your boss’s commitment not to inter-
rupt you during a certain segment of your day — it can pay large dividends 
for you both.
The seagull manager
It’s hard to gain control of the seagull manager. These types of managers do 
the aerial attack of interruption by flying over, pooping on everyone, and 
flying back out. Their bombing run of new ideas, changed priorities, and 
emergency deadlines is ever-changing because their organization and skills in 
management are lacking.
This type of manager is generally young and inexperienced in management 
and motivation. These managers can also be overly aggressive and unrealis-
tic about the results that can be achieved in a specified time frame. The truth 
is that in my younger days and even once in a while now, I can put myself 
into that category.

155
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
With seagull managers, your best bet is to play up to their desire to achieve. 
Point out that you understand the importance of having the department 
pull together to help meet these goals. Confirm with your boss that the 
work you’re currently involved in is in alignment with those goals. (You may 
uncover that it’s not — and that may be the reason for your boss’s repeated 
interruptions.)
If you get an affirmative, however, you then have an opportunity to ask for 
your boss’s help in assuring that you fulfill your role in the process. The talk 
may go this way:
“I want to do everything I can to help meet our goal. As I understand your 
expectations, I need to devote at least X hours of uninterrupted time each 
day to this work. To make sure I’m investing that time on the right tasks, 
would you like to meet briefly to go over what I plan to accomplish during 
that period?”
With a response like this, you establish that you’re on board with the boss’s 
agenda and you assume an implied agreement that he or she believes that 
your work should be uninterrupted. But by asking for the boss’s advice on 
your approach, you soften your declaration and offer an opportunity for the 
boss to reaffirm your need for uninterrupted time.
The verbal delegator
The verbal-delegator type of manager can really gum up productivity and 
performance. In my experience with skilled staff members, delegating small 
projects, small tasks, and deadlines works better through writing. The verbal 
delegator often delegates because something popped into his head and 
he wants to move it off his plate because he doesn’t want to think about it 
again. He moves into some subordinate’s world at that moment, regardless of 
schedule.
 
Your best solution is to try to turn the verbal delegator to a nonverbal delega-
tor. To do so, urge your boss to put any work request in writing. This ensures 
that you get the directions straight and avoids the risk that the boss will 
double-assign a task. The icing on this cake is that you reduce the number of 
interruptions. If your supervisor has to put the order in writing, he’s sitting 
at the computer writing up an e-mail rather than buzzing you on the phone 
or stopping in your cubicle. If you’re working with a boss who’s still in the 
information cul-de-sac trying to find his way to the information highway, then 
use written request forms instead. You can use something as simple as the 
example in Figure 9-1.

Working with Intrusive Clients
Most businesses have customers of some sort — and most embrace a phi-
losophy of placing a high level of value on their customers. From department 
stores to fast-food drive-throughs, most companies follow some iteration of 
“the customer is always right.”
That said, you know that to provide the best service to each customer, you 
have to seek some balance. If the squeaky-wheel clients take up more than their 
share of your time and resources, you won’t be able to give the attention to 
other deserving customers. Although all customers and clients are important 
to a growing and thriving business, some believe they’re more important than 
others — even if they aren’t. Some customers just require more attention, and 
they often manifest those feelings by being more disruptive. Their interruptions 
are simply cries for attention — they want to be valued and appreciated.
The truth is that some customers and clients really do have more value than 
others to the company. Their revenue to the company is larger. They buy prod-
ucts and services that have higher profit margins. They’re more influential in the 
marketplace as your advocates in sending you more business through referrals. 
To assume that all customers and clients are alike is a naïve approach.
When dealing with intrusive clients and investing large amounts of time, 
make sure they’re worth it. If they’re high maintenance, they must be also 
high revenue and high reward. In the following sections, I tell you how to 
handle customers who want attention.

157
 Chapter 9: Defending Your Day from Interruptions
Giving a bit of attention 
that goes a long way
I’m amazed at how taken for granted customers and clients are in today’s 
business world. Expressing appreciation packs a powerful professional 
punch. When was the last time you were thanked or told, “I appreciate your 
business,” by your attorney, doctor, dentist, accountant, realtor, dry cleaner, 
gas station attendant, grocery clerk, barista, or food server? Just that simple 
act stands out significantly as a positive interruption for clients.
 
A preemptive strike can reduce the interruptions you may entertain from 
some of your more high-maintenance clientele. Here are a few strategies for 
making your customers feel appreciated and — at the same time — reducing 
interruptions from them:
 
 Send a handwritten thank-you note for their business. Then send 
one again any time they upgrade, add to their order, or increase their 
business with you.
 
 Remember their birthdays. Send a handwritten card or small token.
 
 A terrific service for mailing cards is Send Out Cards (www.dirk
zeller.com/SOC). You can program a business follow-up plan for key 
clients or even your nephew’s birthdays for years in advance with a few 
clicks of the mouse.
 
 Call them on a regular basis. How frequently you should call depends on 
the business, the client, and other particulars. But a check-in for no other 
reason than to make sure everything is going okay racks up a lot of points.
 
 Deliver added value. Forward articles of personal or professional 
interest. Alert customers to resources, products, and services that may 
or may not be related to your business interests. This gesture conveys 
that you value the relationship beyond business motives. (See Chapter 6 
for tips on keeping client information with a customer relationship 
management [CRM] program.)
Another technique is calling customers back and telling them that they’re 
so important that you squeezed them into your schedule or that you called 
them first. This technique is extremely effective when you return a call before 
the appointed time. If you informed them on voice mail that you’ll be calling 
them back at 11a.m. and you manage to get your priorities done early and 
can start calling the high-interruption clients back at 10:30 a.m., they’ll think 
you walk on water.

158
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Setting clients’ expectations
Educating customers about your availability is important. Let new customers 
know your schedule and the best times to reach you as well as how to leave 
a message when you can’t be reached. As part of this education, you also 
want to establish how quickly they can expect a response from you after they 
leave a message: Within 24 hours? The same business day?
What you’re trying to avoid is the person who calls you back five times that 
day because you were in meetings. With every call, the client gets more frus-
trated you haven’t called her back. Or worse yet, she reaches you on the fifth 
call before you’re walking into your most important meeting of the day, creat-
ing the worst interruption of your life because she unloads on you and ruins 
your focus.
 
Creating reasonable expectations is key in good customer relations. Taking 24 
hours to return a client’s call may be reasonable — but it won’t seem that way 
if the client expects to hear from you within an hour.
As for existing clients and customers, be sure to update them whenever 
your availability circumstances change. If, for example, your work hours 
are changing — maybe you’re switching to part time or a four-day work-
week — notify customers of the schedule revisions and your new availabil-
ity. Depending on the importance of the client and the immediacy of the 
situations you deal with, you may even want to let customers know when 
you’re on vacation or on a business trip in which you can’t be reached.
You can also reinforce wait times through your voice mail message. By leav-
ing your availability and response details as part of your message, callers are 
more likely to recall and retain. Here’s an example:
“You’ve reached Dirk Zeller. I am out of the office today, Tuesday, 
September second. Please leave a message and I will return your call by 
end-of-day Wednesday, September third. If you need immediate assistance, 
please call so-and-so. Until then, make it a great day!”
I’ve set the scenario: The caller shouldn’t expect a return call from me today. 
And in fact, because I’ll be returning to an inbox filled with calls, e-mail, and 
correspondence, I may not be able to get back until as late as the end of the 
day. I’ve offered, however, a back-up plan if the situation is more urgent. This 
should satisfy virtually anyone who calls.
 
Don’t be tempted to include “If it’s an emergency, call me on my cellphone” 
unless you’re prepared for lots of interruptions. After all, isn’t interruption 
exactly what you’re trying to avoid?

M
uch of my work today — writing, developing far-reaching sales pro-
grams for clients, and putting together and presenting training work-
shops — involves long-term, complex, multi-staged projects that require 
great investments of research, development, and time. And with business 
booming, I can’t afford to get behind.
And I don’t have to — not when I can conquer those tendencies to put 
things off. In this chapter, I show you what procrastination is and how to 
recognize it. Not all procrastination is bad, however, so I help you see the 
difference between good reasons to postpone action and mere excuses to 
put something off.
But most importantly, I provide tools and tactics to help you overcome that 
debilitating paralysis that keeps you from getting started or the attacks that 
slow you down or stop you mid-project. One of the most important principles 
in overcoming procrastination is to take the first step — so go ahead and get 
started.

160
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Staring Down the Source: How 
Procrastination Takes Hold
Although many people believe that they postpone the unpleasant when 
they indulge in procrastination, fact is, putting things off carries a lot of 
emotional unpleasantness. Boiled down to its purest form, procrastination is 
simply deferring or delaying action. But of course, it’s not nearly that simple. 
Understanding what provokes procrastination and how it affects you is the 
first step in overcoming the impulses that keep you from moving forward.
Recognizing procrastination isn’t always easy, especially when your time of 
reckoning is a few weeks or months away. You may simply believe you’re 
waiting until the right time to get started. Here are some indications that you 
may be putting off what you shouldn’t.
Calling on short-sighted logic: 
“I have plenty of time”
It’s easy to justify the idea that you don’t have to start on a project when its 
completion date isn’t for some time off. Perhaps your tax returns don’t have to 
be submitted until April 15, and it’s the middle of January. True, you still have 
time, so you don’t need to put “file taxes” at the top of your priority list at this 
point. But you should pull your documents together at least 30 days before 
the deadline. If you use an accountant, you may need even more time to have 
meetings and research a few deductions to get the proper documentation. 
Procrastinators, on the other hand, tend to cling to this logic way past the point 
of manageability. Nine times out of ten, the procrastinator who says “later” in 
January is scrambling to get in the extension form at 11 p.m. on April 14.
Avoiding the unpleasant: “I don’t 
want to think about it now”
If you just discovered that you hold the winning lottery ticket, you wouldn’t 
delay calling in for your reward. Who feels conflicted about winning money? 
But putting off tasks that are unpleasant, that are difficult to accomplish, or 
that you feel conflicted about is human nature. Consider these examples:
 
 You delay turning in the expense report for your recent business trip. 
Tallying up receipts is such a bore.
 
 You put off having the birds-and-bees talk with your preteen. 

161
 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
 
 You’ve ignored keeping up with your quarterly statistics for weeks.
 
 You rearrange your office and clean your desk instead of picking up the 
phone and starting on your sales calls for the day.
When someone faces a situation that requires confrontation with others, the 
tendency is also to procrastinate. Most humans — talk show hosts excluded — 
seem hard-wired to avoid disagreements with others. Sometimes, however, what 
may have been a small confrontation turns into a major confrontation because 
it builds over time. Say, for instance, Boy meets Girl. Boy and Girl go out. Boy 
decides he wants to go out with someone else. Boy keeps putting off “the talk” 
with Girl because he knows it’ll be uncomfortable. But every time Boy postpones 
until the next date, he has a miserable time with Girl and adds even more guilt 
and discomfort.
Or take the case of delaying a disciplinary action with an employee. When 
you avoid that conversation, the employee’s behavior may continue or 
become even worse. In some cases, it can lead to cause for dismissal. 
But most companies require that certain steps be taken to resolve issues 
before termination, and documenting disciplinary actions is one of those 
steps. Because you haven’t followed the process, you’re in the middle of an 
unavoidable and ugly conflict that you can’t quickly resolve.
 
The longer you postpone confrontations, the worse the situation can 
get. And by the time you’re forced to address it, all the reasons you hate 
confrontation are sure to be magnified.
Triggering your fears: “What if I 
screw up? And what if I don’t?”
Sometimes putting something off stems from more than poor planning or 
overcommitment. Many procrastinators are unsure of themselves and their 
abilities. They wait until the last minute to complete projects because that 
way, if their work isn’t well received, they can tell themselves it was because 
they didn’t have enough time to finish the project to their satisfaction.
 
I know of one woman who was thrilled to have finally gotten her first book 
deal with a well-known publisher. She had a reasonable schedule for a nonfic-
tion title — six months — but three months passed and she hadn’t produced 
more than the book’s introduction. After some soul-searching, she recognized 
that she was delaying her work because she feared that if the book were pub-
lished and no one bought it or she got a bad review, that would mean she’d 
failed.

162
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
You can just as easily procrastinate because of fear of success as fear of fail-
ure. Fearing success and how it may change your relationships and friends is 
real. Many people don’t reach outside their comfort zones because of what 
their parents, siblings, and Uncle Ned will say. In some circles, becoming too 
successful may cause you to leave some people behind.
 
Success also can affect your spouse or significant other. I have a sister-in-law 
who felt that all wealthy people did something wrong or unethical to acquire 
their wealth. With our success, Joan was more affected by her views than I, 
but it did make family events uncomfortable.
Paralyzed by perfection: “I’ll 
wait till the time is right”
Sure, you want to do the best job you can. But procrastinators often use their 
quest for perfection as an excuse to delay. As a close cousin to fear of failure 
(see the preceding section), the desire for perfection can paralyze you. If you 
spend too much time checking facts, trying to select the perfect words or 
phrases, or rewriting a paragraph numerous times, you’re probably doing so 
at the expense of other more important things. Frequently, procrastinators 
try to avoid and delay challenges, like projects that are mentally taxing or 
big-picture tasks. They rationalize that they’re not in the right frame of mind, 
are too distracted to give it their best, or are waiting for inspiration to strike. 
The danger here, of course, is that by procrastinating, you push yourself into 
a corner and, without adequate time, do a job that’s far less than perfect.
A bit of perspective may lead you to the root of the problem, because pro-
crastination is often a symptom of something that’s troubling you on a 
subconscious level. Perhaps consider why you feel the need for things to be 
perfect. Have always felt the need for perfection, even as a child? Could you 
have learned this behavior from circumstances in your childhood? Is your 
current or previous boss a perfectionist?
 
I’m not saying you shouldn’t try to do an outstanding job. You should abso-
lutely strive to make every task and project a masterpiece — whatever it is. 
But be careful not to use it as an excuse to postpone taking that first step. 
Doing your best with the resources you have is truly the goal in life. Use your 
time, skills, mental capabilities, and actions to help you avoid being paralyzed 
by perfection. Also, keeping the 80/20 rule in mind can help you move on to 
the next project or goal (turn to Chapter 4 for more on the 80/20 rule).

Sabotaging at mid-process: 
“I’ve earned a break”
Although most people are stricken by procrastination before they take their 
initial steps, the urge to put off completing a project occurs frequently, too. 
The more complex and lengthy the task, the greater the odds are of losing 
momentum, getting distracted, and giving up before you reach the end. 
 
I admit that my procrastinitis hits me mid-project. Starting something new 
revs me up. I love launching a training course or working on a new project 
with a client, and I tend to dive in with enthusiasm. That’s always why writing 
the first half of a book is significantly easier than the last half.

Your Motivation as You Press Ahead”
Looking for thrills: “I work 
best under pressure”
Many people who claim to work best under pressure are merely procrasti-
nators in disguise. The first thing to do is to figure out whether you really 
work well under the pressure of tight deadlines. I know personally that most 
high-dominant behavioral style individuals do work best under pressure. 
That’s only 18 percent of the population, so the chance you fit that category 
is about 1 in 5. 
You can get a rush from having to work in a state of high productivity and hit-
ting the deadline. You feel a sense of accomplishment in knowing that most 
of your colleagues couldn’t have pulled it off. The problem with forcing your-
self into those situations is that once in a while, you get burned by not hitting 
the deadline or by crashing as soon as you cross the finish line.
 
My best advice is to do some of the planning for your projects when you get 
them. Invest the time in planning out the steps even if you don’t have the 
time to complete them. One of the benefits is that you’ll be sure of the time, 
resources, materials, and help you’ll need to pull off your project. This plan-
ning enables you to accurately gauge what you need so you get fewer sur-
prises when you put your whole effort in motion.
And if you still feel you need more deadline-driven excitement in your job, 
perhaps your boss will reward you with more responsibility — and a raise to 
go with it.

Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Knowing Whether to Put It Off
Postponing action isn’t productive when it holds you back, costs you time 
and money, and results in a negative outcome. But sometimes, putting some-
thing off is the best course of action. The challenge is knowing when it’s right 
to procrastinate. This section helps you sort that out.
Poor procrastination: Considering the costs
With procrastination, the bottom-line loss of time, money, and productivity 
is enormous — enormous to you, to your company, to your country, and to 
the world. A global tally of the cost of procrastination is more than a little 
overwhelming to take in, but the negative impact is clear in closer-to-home 
examples, too. Here’s what poor procrastination costs you:
 
 Money: Consider the impact when you pay your bills late: You get 
dinged with a late fee, which can be as much as $25 or more. If you do 
that half the time, you rack up $150 per year. And that’s not factoring in 
the increased interest (compounded daily) you pay.
 
 Now crank it up a bit. When you routinely pay your bills late, your credit 
rating isn’t so hot. So when you apply for a mortgage or home equity 
loan, you don’t get the best interest rate. You may not even realize how 
much that fraction of an interest point can make over your 30-year mort-
gage. Your habit of procrastinating can cost you as much as $50,000 
over the loan’s lifetime!
 
 Quality: Putting things off until the last minute means you have less time 
to do the job than it probably warrants. Some of you can boast pulling 
an A out of such an experience. But most people, if they’re honest, con-
fess that the eleventh-hour cram session doesn’t bring them their best 
grades — or a meaningful understanding of the material. So as you try 
to cram ten days into five doing a job you’re not comfortable with in the 
first place, you lose even more sleep, work even more fatigued, and — 
surprise — your paper is returned to you for major rework.
 
 Time: When you put off a task, you spend a limited amount of time 
actively choosing not to start your project. And then there’s the time 
that the thing you should’ve been doing but weren’t takes up residence 
in your mind, even though you’re doing other things. It still counts as 
time invested in the task you’re putting off because it’s affecting the 
quality of whatever else you’re doing in the moment.
 
 Your well-being: The responsibility doesn’t go away simply because you 
put off doing the job, and you end up carrying the guilt of not doing what 
you know you should. The stress of the work ahead and the not-doing it 
causes both emotional anxiety and physical stress, from loss of sleep to 
stomach problems to depression. In short, procrastination feels lousy.

 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
Wise procrastination: Knowing 
when to hold ’em
 
The secret to successful procrastination is to do it deliberately, based on the 
time that you have and the status of the tasks. Take a look at what’s on your 
plate and choose the tasks that are least time-sensitive and least at-risk, and then 
postpone them for a bit. In other words, allow yourself to procrastinate — but 
give yourself a deadline by which to complete those tasks. This section covers 
tasks you can afford to — and probably should — procrastinate on.
When haste could cause harm
Many tasks or decisions that require action are critical and must be accom-
plished in a timely manner. But when making the right decision is important, 
opt for procrastination if haste could result in a damaging outcome. When 
you feel pressured to make a choice or are forced to take an action you’re 
uncertain of, in most cases, putting it off until you’re clear-headed and can 
think through your decision is a good use of procrastination.
Here’s an example: The salesperson offers you a hefty discount on those 
super-insulating windows — but it’s only good at the time of the offer. Defer 
until tomorrow, and the price goes back up by 20 percent. You’re torn. The 
salesperson assures you that the company is highly rated and the product is 
the best quality. You know you need new windows, but you hadn’t planned to 
buy them until the salesperson knocked on your door.
In this case, your instinct to hold off is a good one. The windows and the 
deal are probably legitimate. But you haven’t had a chance to investigate this 
opportunity as carefully as you should to ensure that you make a wise move. 
Trust me: This is probably not your last opportunity to buy those windows at 
a special price.
When the timing isn’t right
Sometimes, the key to success is timing. You may have an important objec-
tive on your to-do list: It may be something that’s critical in helping you 
achieve your goals. But your instinct to put on the brakes may be because 
the timing isn’t right — the time and energy you’d put out is far greater than 
what you’d get in return.
Maybe you delay putting your house on the market — it’s a bad time to sell, 
so why invest the time and energy when the likelihood of selling at the price 
you need to is minimal? Or perhaps you need to put in some time in the eve-
ning to prepare for a meeting in the morning. But the baby is sick, and even 
if you ignore his distress or leave your spouse to handle it, you’re distracted 
and worried.

166
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
The point is that you can’t possibly be as productive or accomplish as much 
when the timing isn’t right. You may end up investing a lot more time and 
energy — and not get the return you hoped for. So do the best that you can; 
you need to invest the time necessary so that you’re prepared enough for the 
meeting but also give the necessary assistance to your family. Learn to recog-
nize those times that you’re swimming against the current, and then stop and 
re-evaluate your priorities and change direction if needed.
When the task isn’t critical
You’re loaded down with projects and commitments, all of them important 
and none of them offloadable. Heck, you’re not procrastinating — you’re 
drowning. In situations like this, procrastinating can be a survival strategy. 
You just need to decide which items to put off.
 
If you have to put off doing something because of time limitations, make it one 
of the routine day-to-day tasks. These are the low-value, low-reward actions 
that produce limited results, something you can most likely delegate to some-
one else. Be cautious about postponing the growth and big-picture aspects: 
Even though they tend to be more long-term in scope, if you don’t stay on top 
of these issues, the consequences can be significant.
You can put off less-important to-do items in your personal life, too. For 
instance, say you have to accomplish the following tasks: Do your taxes by 
next week, finish an important presentation for work in a week-and-a-half, 
paint the guest room before your in-laws come next week, and talk with your 
travel agent about your trip to Bali this summer. You may choose to put off 
painting the guest room because it’s not critical to your in-laws’ visit (they’ll 
be just as happy with smoky-blue walls as moss-green ones). Or you can 
postpone the meeting with the travel agent because you have more time to 
accomplish that than you have for the taxes and the presentation.
Laying the Groundwork: Altering Your 
Mindset and Instituting Discipline
Everyone has three weapons in the arsenal for fighting procrastination. Call 
upon these formidable forces, unleash their power, and reclaim control of 
your time:
 
 Decision: First, it’s important to recognize procrastination when you 
see it and admit that you’re guilty. At that point, you can take action to 
squelch the urge. Decide to begin the steps to stay on course with your 
obligation. In short, make a commitment and hold fast. 

167
 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
 
 Determination: Determination is the push that gets you through the late 
hours, the long days, and the uncomfortable places that make you want 
to put off your obligation. It’s the commitment to see the task through to 
completion and on time. Although determination is often an innate sense 
of responsibility, it’s also a habit that you can learn, and constant prac-
tice keeps it working.
 
 Discipline: Just as you use discipline to train yourself in other areas — 
picking up a sport or taking a class; sticking to a time-management plan 
and schedule-planning system; going on a diet or undertaking an exercise 
plan — your vigilant effort to keep on course with your commitments can 
serve as a major motivator. Approach your procrastination with the same 
focus: Discipline yourself to get started and stay on course.
The following sections name a few alternate routes to keep you on track so 
you arrive at your destination — on time.
Motivating yourself with the 
carrot-or-stick approach
The nature of human beings is to move away from pain and toward pleasure. 
In setting up a prioritization plan, you can use the carrot-or-stick approach 
to drive yourself toward accomplishment. When you feel the urge to procras-
tinate, maybe what you need is a carrot dangling in front of your face — an 
incentive to keep pressing on. Hey, it worked when you were a kid: “If you 
clean your room now, you can stay up tonight and watch monster movies.” 
On the other hand, some folks respond better to reminders of consequences — 
the threat of the stick. For them, the promise of a reward gets no reaction, but 
avoiding negative consequences scares them into action.
Here’s an example: You hate working out — it means you have to get up ear-
lier to get to the gym, work up a sweat when you could be getting another 
hour of sleep or enjoying a latte and the newspaper. But keep in mind the end 
result of your choice: the awful feeling of being overweight or out of shape, 
ill-fitting clothing, high blood pressure, and low stamina. On the flip side 
is the pleasure of a fit physique; boundless energy; and a stab at a longer, 
healthier life.
A work-life example is the salesperson who drives herself to put in two hours 
of prospecting calls each day (instead of just one) by reminding herself that 
a higher commission check, management recognition, and a grander family 
vacation are the rewards for the effort. If she neglects this effort, conse-
quences await her: a poor performance evaluation, lower income, more effort 
to make up for sales shortfall, and perhaps even termination.

168
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Seeking reward
If anticipating the pleasurable consequences of tackling an action you don’t 
really enjoy motivates you to perform it, then focus on those positives. And 
if rewards help, shower yourself with them. If the vision of a latte and your 
favorite scone gives you the get-up-and-go to take care of your task, go for it 
(after you finish the job, of course!). Or if a vacation moves you toward finish-
ing an onerous freelance project, set a date for when you’ll book the trip, and 
follow through when you wrap up the project.
 
Whenever motivation lags, pause to remind yourself of your incentive upon 
achieving success. Consider tacking up an enticing photo near your most 
tempting place of hesitation. The photo can be any number of things: A place 
you want to go, a person you want to spend time with, someone with qualities 
you’d like to attain, and so on. If your reward for a freelance writing project 
is a Caribbean vacation, for example, tack up a photo of a tropical setting or 
beach along a sparkling blue ocean right by your computer.
Avoiding consequences
If you’re more leery of the results of neglect than excited about a reward 
upon completion, ask yourself about the consequences you’ll face if you fail 
to complete certain steps toward your goal, and remind yourself of them as 
often as you need to.
 
If you find that consequences are your surest motivators, make sure you focus 
on the immediate ones. Unfortunately, when consequences are delayed, the 
human response is to delay positive action. Skipping your workout today won’t 
give you a heart attack tomorrow — so why not sleep in a little longer? Putting 
off your prospecting calls today won’t reduce your paycheck this week. Because 
skipping these steps toward your ultimate goal doesn’t immediately produce 
pain, it’s easy to (wrongly) convince yourself that there are no consequences.
 
You can set up new, unpleasant consequences if you have trouble focus-
ing on the long term. Several years ago, two of my clients struggled with 
procrastination. They’d fill out every last page of paperwork, sharpen their 
pencils, and arrange their paper clips before they’d begin their important 
work. Striving to be recognized as employee-of-the-month didn’t motivate 
them, so I tried something a little unorthodox: I had each of them write a 
$500 check and send it to me. One client made the check out to a political 
party that he absolutely abhorred and would never contribute to; the other 
salesperson made out the check to a competitor. If they didn’t break through 
their procrastination, I’d have permission to address and mail those checks. 
As expected, I never sent those checks. Their desire to avoid violating their 
political beliefs or giving money to their biggest competitor ensured their 
daily move through the valley of procrastination. If you opt for this plan, you 
can have a boss, friend, or even your spouse hold the money.

169
 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
Recognizing excuses and 
shoving them aside
Procrastination is definitely in your control, but some influences in your life 
certainly seem to affect your inclination to procrastinate. And when that hap-
pens, the tendency is to make excuses, to blame someone or something else.
Resisting peer pressure
It’s a fact of life: Co-workers, friends, acquaintances, and family all seem to 
conspire to tempt you away from what you should be doing. But on some 
level, when you want to avoid an obligation, you’re looking for those oppor-
tunities to postpone, and it’s great to have someone else or some situation to 
blame.
Say, for example, that your friend tries to talk you into taking the day off to 
go to the beach. You have a big presentation coming up the next week and 
you need every minute to prepare beforehand. But it’s a painfully tedious 
process, you’re dreading the presentation, and the last thing you want to be 
doing is writing yourself a speech. Sounds like a great opportunity to procras-
tinate. But here’s where discipline comes in.
 
When another person encourages you to forsake your work, before you 
submit to the pressure, acknowledge that you’re likely using this person as 
an excuse. Then remind yourself what you need to do to meet your priorities 
now. Here’s the real question: Is taking time off with your friend bringing you 
closer to or further away from your goals?
Seeing whether outside forces really do prevent work
Sometimes, you may feel like you’re forced to procrastinate due to some 
external factor beyond your control — weather, traffic jam, power failure. 
Trust me — I know the feeling.
 
Recently, I was working on a chapter of this book at home. The weather 
was beautiful and I longed to join my family outside. Suddenly, the power 
went out. Although my laptop was still working fine, I didn’t have access to 
the Internet, which I needed for some fact-checking. What a perfect excuse 
to stop work and call it a day! Okay, fact is, I didn’t need Internet access to 
continue working on my chapter. I knew I could make good progress, even if 
I couldn’t tie everything up. I just wanted a reason to justify putting off the 
chapter until later.

170
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
In situations like this one, step back and assess the situation. Ask yourself the 
following:
 
 Is there another way you can accomplish this task?
 
 Would the quality of your work be compromised if you were to complete 
the task under these circumstances?
 
 Can you at least take some action to stay on track?
In my case, I had to confess that I could indeed continue to work on my 
chapter — and that I really did want to finish it that day. Although the qual-
ity of my work wouldn’t be affected, I wouldn’t be able to finish the chapter 
without online confirmation of a few things. I also knew that rain was in the 
forecast for the next day. So I determined to make myself forge ahead, writing 
as much as I could for another hour. Then I planned a break to get together 
the fixings for a family cookout, followed by another hour of work before I 
fired up the grill.
 
Granted, in certain situations, you have no choice but to put off your task. If 
you’re poised to cut the grass and a sudden downpour soaks the lawn, you 
have to postpone the chore. But be sure that you’re not manipulating the 
situation so that you have an honorable excuse to do what you wanted to do, 
anyway. 
You have some options when you really can’t make progress on the task at 
hand:
 
 Move to the next most-important task on your list and come back to the 
most-important one later.
 
 Trade time off. Take a break this afternoon but plan to work later this 
week during your previously scheduled afternoon off. Or choose to get 
up earlier later in the week to make up for it.
Give me a break: Putting 
off procrastination
Sounds counterintuitive, I know, but sometimes putting off procrastination is 
the proverbial hair of the dog that bit you. That is, a little planned procras-
tination can solve a larger procrastination problem. As soon as you become 
aware that you’re procrastinating, don’t beat yourself up; instead, allow your-
self to procrastinate — but just not yet.
Here’s how it works: Identify the ways you’re likely to put off working on 
your project. Then, instead of fighting a losing battle with your willpower, 
tell yourself it’s okay to do those activities — after you put in a set amount of 
work on your project.

171
 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
Suppose you’re trying to get a good head start on a paper for a class, but 
you’ve been putting it off for almost anything else that comes along: a lunch 
date, a shopping errand, even a TV show. You can plan to run that errand — 
after you spend a half-hour getting your notes in order and reviewing your 
outline. Chances are, by the time you look up at the clock, you’ll have spent 
an hour or longer and have made a lot more progress than you anticipated. 
You may decide to keep on working, now that you’re engrossed in the task. 
But even if you do break at this point, you’ll have gotten more done than had 
you simply quit earlier. The psychological edge is likely to help motivate you 
to make even further progress.
 
When postponing your procrastination, give yourself fairly short time commit-
ments. Tell yourself you’ll just spend a half hour or an hour on the project before 
you allow yourself a break. This is more likely to keep you on task than if you 
commit yourself to three hours of work. With that time commitment, you may 
end up procrastinating on your procrastination of procrastinating — uh, I think.
Conquering Dreaded Tasks with 
Sandwich Tactics
Sometimes what’s on your plate seems so big that you can’t sink your teeth 
into any of it. In these cases, taking things apart may be the best way to make 
progress, stay on track, and put away that project. Here’s the breakdown.
The eat-the-crust-first approach: Starting 
with the tough job
One extremely successful technique to move beyond procrastination is to 
tackle the toughest job first. Or if you’re working on a single, big task, take on 
the most difficult aspect of it before the rest.
 
I advise coordinating this tough-stuff-first effort so that you start it first thing 
in the morning, a time when most people are at their peak in terms of energy, 
intensity, and focus. If you conquer the most difficult task first, your day will 
be a lot more productive.
To ratchet up your results further, start the prep work for the toughest tasks 
the night before. In Chapter 4, I share how you can set the stage and make 
quick work of even your most challenging projects. When you prepare well 
for your effort, you won’t spend 30 minutes just getting ready to go.
If you get stuck on the big task, you can regain momentum with the salami 
approach or Swiss-cheese approach, which I outline next.

172
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
The Swiss-cheese approach: Poking 
little holes in the task
 
When biting into a major or complicated task seems overwhelming, start with 
the easier pieces — the aspects that you know you can complete quickly and 
with little effort. In this way, you poke holes in the project, making lighter 
work of the steps that remain after you polish off the manageable aspects.
For example, suppose you’re facing your kitchen after a dinner party: dishes 
piled to the tops of the cupboards, leftovers cooling in their serving dishes, 
the sink clogged with kitchen scraps, and the roaster pan caked with burned 
food and tenacious grease. The job is more than you can fathom at midnight. 
You’re tempted to turn around, go to bed, and hope the kitchen fairies come 
in the night to transform your kitchen into its former spotless self. 
Or you can tell yourself you’ll do one simple thing before you turn out the 
lights: maybe put away all the food and scrape the scraps into the compost 
bin or garbage disposal. And then when you make short work of that, you tell 
yourself that filling up the dishwasher with at least one load won’t take that 
long. When that’s done, you decide you can at least rinse and stack the other 
dishes. By the time you poke these holes into the project, not too much is 
left. Even if you give up at this point, the task that awaits you in the morning 
isn’t nearly so formidable.
The salami approach: Finishing 
it one slice at a time
 
The salami approach is a great tactic for those long-term projects in which 
the deadline seems so far away that you convince yourself you don’t need to 
start yet. So you don’t resort to cramming at the eleventh hour, take the time 
immediately to cut up the project into bite-sized pieces. These slices should 
be small enough that you can schedule them day-by-day or at least week-by-
week.
The number of ways you can slice and dice a large task are many, but here’s 
one option for breaking it down:
 
1. Set time aside to plan the project completely so you can begin work-
ing on it and cut it down to size.
 
2. Create an action order of what needs to be done and when.
 
 Creating a time line helps you segment the task into pieces.

173
 Chapter 10: Overcoming Procrastination, a Notorious Time Thief
 
3. Figure out what materials you need for the task.
 
 Collect all the materials and make them ready and available.
 
When I begin my book projects, the publisher gives me a certain amount of 
time, usually several months, to complete the manuscript. I know from expe-
rience that I can’t look at the project as a single huge step; it’s too daunting. 
So I break it up. For example, if I have six months to write the book and it’s 
24 chapters long, I break down the project into chapter slices. So instead of 
“write book in six months,” it’s “write chapter this week.” Or it may be “write 
ten pages a day this week” or some other breakdown that’s meaningful to me.
The discard-the-garnish approach: 
Getting it off your plate
Often when you order an entree at a restaurant, the dish may include some 
sprigs of parsley or an orange slice in addition to a side or two and a drizzle 
of some fancy sauce. It makes for a pretty presentation, and it’s edible, too. 
But unless you’re really hungry, those items are often still on your plate when 
the bus person clears off the table.
 
Just as with a restaurant meal, you probably have a few commitments on your 
plate that aren’t really a key part of your responsibilities. Take a look at your 
schedule and see whether some of these tasks are mere garnishes. You then 
have choices:
 
 Remove them from your plate.
 
 Give them to someone else.
 
 Save them until you finish everything else.
Maintaining Your Motivation 
as You Press Ahead
Everyone has struggled with procrastination, and many still do. I have yet to 
meet a person who doesn’t battle with the temptations of putting off those 
obligations that seem too big, too hard, or just plain no fun. Recognizing your 
tendencies is the first step toward recovery. By following the strategies I 
outline in this chapter, you can make remarkable progress in overcoming the 
procrastination.

174
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Staying on the right course, however, is a never-ending vigil. Use these main-
tenance tactics to do so:
 
 Keep your expectations realistic. Before you beat yourself up for your 
woeful procrastinating ways once again, take a look at your schedule 
and first figure out whether what you’re attempting to accomplish is 
realistic. Have you accepted an assignment you’re not qualified to take 
on, or is too much expected of you? Have you committed to an absurd 
deadline?
 
 Again, when you begin to feel overwhelmed by your workload, this may 
be an indicator that you’ll slip into postponement mode. So do whatever 
you can to get over being overwhelmed. It may require some adjustment 
in expectations — your co-workers’, your boss’s, or yours.
 
 Handle the big stuff and delegate the rest. When you find that too 
many obligations and projects are demanding your attention to the 
point that you’re putting off making headway on any of them, it’s time to 
lighten your load. 
 
 After you examine your workload and identify what’s really important 
to your job or your career goals, you know what to attend to first. But 
instead of putting those smaller or less-important tasks on the back 
burner, see whether someone else can take over for you.
 
 Prevent clutter overload. Another sign that your procrastinating pro-
clivities may soon raise their ugly head — or already have: Your office 
or home is cluttered with a confusion of papers and files, your e-mail 
inbox contains more than a week’s worth of unread mail, and you’ve lost 
control of your schedule. 
 
 You can’t maintain control of your time or stay on top of your obliga-
tions if your life has become so disorganized that you can’t keep on top 
of your work and home. It’s no wonder you’re procrastinating — if you 
have a project in all that mess, you don’t even know where to start.
 
 You may be on overload. You may have too many projects at once. At 
any rate, it’s time to clear your head and your desk. Take a day once a 
month or a few hours to purge, file, respond, and clean up. (See Chapter 
5 for tips on clearing your workspace.)
 
 Focus on maintaining a healthy balance. Both your work life and your 
personal life are important to your well-being. Keep an eye on the scale to 
be sure that these different areas are in balance. If you get weighted down 
at the office, you lose energy and perspective, and procrastination — both 
at home and at work — creeps in. If family issues take over, you risk your 
performance at work. When one aspect of your life gets out of whack, do 
everything you can to regain balance.

ife is always serving up decisions, and making choices — even wrong 
ones — is how you grow, mature, and accomplish the things that make 
life meaningful. If you’re stymied by small decisions, you never have the time 
and energy to seek out choices that lead to a more enriching and success-
ful life. In other words, decisiveness is more than a useful tool; it’s a way of 
living. Indecision, on the other hand, is a way of drifting, simply surrendering 
to fate.
It’s all too easy to get bogged down weighing and reweighing options in a pur-

the tyranny of what-if only bleeds you of energy. Sitting on the fence is ineffi-
cient, not to mention uncomfortable. And not deciding? Well, that’s a decision 
itself — with its own consequences.
Like many important life skills, effective decision-making isn’t taught in 
school. Most people learn by trial and error and through the experiences 
of other people. Unfortunately, this approach can leave you floundering in 
a sea of changing choices. So in this chapter, I help you tap into your inner 
wisdom, enabling you to make better decisions because of your level of dis-
cernment and to take action more quickly because of your ability to under-
stand, evaluate, and consider all possible outcomes.
When you begin to feel more confident about making smaller decisions, you 
find it easier to apply what you’ve discovered to larger challenges. You see 
that you can break down what seems confusing, or even overwhelming, into a 
series of smaller steps. Eventually, you’ll be comfortable enough with making 
decisions that you invite them, because being able to quickly and confidently 
make decisions gives you power and control over your life.

Looking at the Source of Most 
Decision-Related Struggles
Why is making a decision so hard? It usually comes down to fear. Fear of 
making the wrong choice. Fear of regret. The more afraid you are of tripping 
up, the more you torture yourself by evaluating, debating, analyzing, and 
obsessing over every decision.
Before you begin to work on your decision-making skills, you need to see 
where the problem lies. Take a moment to ask yourself these big-picture 
questions:
 
 What’s one area of your life you’d like to change but have avoided taking 
action?
 
 What’s really holding you back?
 
 What’s the worst thing that can happen if you decide to take action?
 
 What are the odds that the worst really will happen?
 
 Would you be likely to live through — and even learn valuable lessons 
from — making a mistake?
Armed with the answers to these questions, realize that the fear is probably 
unfounded — that the worst that can happen is very unlikely. Then decide to 
take action on your finding today.
Whittling Major Decisions Down 
to a Manageable Size
Lucky people make good decisions once in a while. Successful people have a 
system they consistently use to approach situations that require decisions: a 
plan of action that works no matter what the circumstances or stress level.
Here’s why: Individual decisions rarely exist in a vacuum. Daily decisions, 
ranging from how and when you discipline your children to whether to stick 
to a regular savings plan, have consequences that may reveal themselves 
only years down the road. The key is to make clear-headed choices today and 
build on good results instead of haphazardly cleaning mistakes as you go. 
Use the following six steps to whittle the formidable task of making a decision 
down to manageable size.

177
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
Step 1: Evaluate the gravity 
of the decision
Can’t decide between the lobster and the steak? Don’t lose your appetite 
over it. Even if you make the wrong choice, chances are you’ll be over your 
regret by your next meal. (Or you could choose the surf-and-turf.) Many other 
life decisions — changing your job or career, buying a home, or undergoing 
surgery — have lasting (sometimes even life-or-death) consequences that 
can significantly affect your family or employees. Obviously, these decisions 
deserve much more attention, time, and care.
The key is to approach situations in every facet of your life with a cool head 
so you can accurately assess the size and gravity of the situation you’re up 
against. Following is a list of the larger, more important areas of your life that 
really deserve some time and effort; decisions in other areas of your life need 
not require much time or thought.
 
 Taking care of business: If you’re a business owner, your daily decisions 
guide the fortunes of your family as well as those of all the employees 
who rely on you for a regular paycheck and benefits. You have to bal-
ance seemingly small decisions (whether to refund a customer’s money) 
with bigger-picture choices (redirecting the business to take advantage 
of a potentially lucrative niche market).
 
 Assessing the size of a business decision isn’t always a straightforward 
process, so look beyond the obvious to possible repercussions. For 
example, failing to provide a refund to a dissatisfied customer may 
prompt that person to post a scathing review of your customer service 
policy on a widely read blog; you may spend months undoing the damage. 
Redirecting resources to a new niche market, on the other hand, may affect 
the morale — and productivity — of employees in core business areas.
 
 Furthering your career: Should you decide to take a higher paying job 
with a longer commute? Hang up your sales hat and study to become 
a nurse? If you’re changing your job, assess the impact of added travel 
expenses and less time with your family. A major career change can 
shake up everything from your budget to your self-image.
 
 Keeping it in the family: Some of life’s major decisions involve your family: 
who you choose to marry, when to have children, where to live. Along with 
these big decisions come plenty of smaller day-to-day decisions. Who takes 
the kids to school? Should you take a vacation or renovate your kitchen? 
Even decisions that don’t seem significant in the moment, such as giving 
your kids unsupervised use of the computer, can have unexpected reper-
cussions. To further complicate things, you may have to step in to provide 
assistance or physically care for your aging parents.

178
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
 Making sense of your finances: Money isn’t the most important thing in 
life, yet it’s the lifeblood of so many important goals. Unfortunately (but 
perhaps not surprisingly), most marital conflict is linked to finances. The 
choices you make about spending, saving, and investing — individually 
or as a couple — can spark daily arguments and have serious long-range 
implications.
 
 Staying healthy: The good news in this area is that the simplest decisions 
can have the most profound effects. Deciding to eat a healthy, balanced 
diet, exercise daily, and take regular breaks from the stress of work can 
prolong and improve the quality of your life. This alone is good prepara-
tion for the more serious, sometimes life-or-death decisions you may have 
to make if you develop a condition such as diabetes, need surgery, or 
require tests.
 
 Building strong relationships: Happy relationships are the foundation 
of a happy life. If you’re married, in a committed relationship, or devoted 
to a circle of close friends, the time and care you invest pay you back a 
thousandfold. If you’re still looking for a spouse or life partner, the deci-
sions you make about the qualities you want and need in someone else 
and the qualities and commitment you’re willing to bring to a relation-
ship shape your future for better or worse.
Step 2: Assess the time frame you 
have to make the decision
When you’re on a time crunch for making a decision, your struggle in making 
that decision increases. Sometimes, you have to make a decision immediately 
because it’s a life-or-death situation. For example, more than ten years ago, 
doctors found four blocked arteries in my father’s heart, which meant a heart 
attack was imminent. His time frame for deciding to have bypass surgery 
was now. He was immediately admitted to the hospital and his surgery was 
performed first thing the following morning.
Thankfully, few decisions must be made this quickly and under life-or-death 
duress. That’s probably why most people are so skilled at procrastinating. 
The key: Give yourself a reasonable deadline, allowing a comfortable but 
finite amount of time to research and consider your options. In decision 
making, you may need to slow down your process, time frame, and expec-
tations in terms of time and results. You have to be willing to take a few 
breaths to pause and then decide.
 
Here are some questions to ask when you’re assessing a reasonable time 
frame for making a decision — let your answers to these questions guide your 
next steps:

179
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
 
 Is there a shelf date on this decision?
 
 Will something good happen if you make the decision by a certain date? 
Will something bad happen if you don’t?
 
 What’s likely to happen if you make the wrong decision within this time 
frame?
 
 What are the consequences of postponing the decision? Can you (and 
your family) live with that?
Step 3: Narrow your options down to two
When faced with a multiple-choice dilemma, it helps to narrow your options. 
If I open my 2-year-old daughter’s closet and say, “Okay, Annabelle, what 
do you want to wear?” she wears me out changing outfits and changing her 
mind. My wife, Joan, has a better strategy: She gives Annabelle only two 
choices.
It’s a technique I call alternative choice, and I’ve used it in my sales coach-
ing practice for 20 years. I narrow each prospect’s choice down to just two 
options. Why? Because having too many choices is confusing. The more 
options you have, the harder it is to commit to just one. Research indicates 
that you’ll be happier with your decision if you choose from a smaller number 
of options.
The fastest and best decision-makers are people who align their decisions 
with their personal or business goals; having this foundation simplifies things 
by narrowing your focus. Identifying your goals, vision, core values, and 
core purpose in life is an important first step (I help you get them on paper 
in Chapter 2). Then check to see which of your options don’t align with your 
goals and cross them off the list.
 
To do a preliminary evaluation of your options, you need to do a limited 
amount of research. Give yourself a time limit for researching possibilities 
(perhaps only an hour online, a half-hour making phone calls, or a half day to 
visit stores). Then, based on your cursory research, decide which two options 
best align with those goals, priorities, and values. Matching options to priori-
ties can be a bit tricky if each option addresses more than one goal — you 
have to decide which options meet your most important goals. I often find it 
helpful to apply the following filters:
 
 Impose a price range to narrow down the choices.
 
 Establish some basic criteria to whittle down the possibilities (open-
toed or sling-back shoes; Asian restaurants on the east side of town; job 
opportunities in major West Coast cities).

180
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
If you find that limited resources are prematurely narrowing down your 
choices, go back to your goals and reassess your resources. List and catego-
rize all the things you lack, and then brainstorm or research ways to over-
come these holes in your plan — I help you accomplish this self-evaluation in 
Chapter 2.
Step 4: Check in with the reliable 
wisdom of your gut
Your body is a very powerful partner in decision-making, whether or not 
you act on what it tells you. So before you invest lots of time researching a 
particular course of action, stop thinking and take note of what you feel deep 
inside — what does intuition tell you?
Somewhere in the vicinity of their stomachs, many people detect a distinct 
discomfort about certain decisions they’re considering — hence the term gut 
feeling. You don’t have to have full-blown indigestion to know you’re not feel-
ing good about a decision. And believe me, all the positive data in the world 
probably won’t change your gut feeling about the outcome. The best decisions 
both make sense logically and feel good in your gut.
Step 5: Research your top options
The more data you collect to support your decision, the more confident you 
feel in the face of uncertainty. Here are some great ways to gather the infor-
mation that can help you decide between your top two choices:
 
 Read a book written by an expert.
 
 Arrange an information interview with someone who’s already made the 
choice you’re considering.
 
 Gather input from family members and friends who will be affected by 
your decision.
 
 Post a question on a message board related to your situation.
 
 Read trade magazines, Web sites, and blogs targeted to the market or 
area you’re researching.
 
The usefulness of data in your quest to make wise choices comes with a 
caveat: Nowadays, you can literally drown in a sea of data. And when that 
happens, analysis paralysis sets in. So as you do your research, make sure 
that the data is valuable, credible, and usable. Remember that data is there 
to support your decision, not make your decision.

181
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
Step 6: Determine the most efficient 
way to get your desired result
Take a close look at what you’re trying to achieve, quantifying (where pos-
sible) what your decision will cost in terms of time, effort, and resources — 
both short-term and long-term. Then look at your desired end result to see 
which path is the best way for you to get there.
Success is subjective. What I may deem important or how I measure the cost 
of a result is unique to me. You have to do what’s right for you. Here are a 
few questions to get you thinking:
 
 How will you know when you’ve achieved a level of success that 
satisfies you? 
 
 How much time will this take? Is the amount of time and money you’ll 
have to invest worth the result?
 
 What would a satisfactory outcome be? What would an outstanding 
result be for you?
 
 What are you willing to do to achieve the satisfactory level?
 
 Can you tangibly or quantifiably measure the results? How would you 
accomplish that?
You can certainly use a pros and cons list to help refine the direct route to 
your desired result. As you make your list, rate your priorities on a scale of 1 
to 10 to give each response some weight.
Evaluating the Results and 
Making Adjustments
 
After you implement your decision, be sure to evaluate the results. Most 
people make time errors in not evaluating the decisions they make soon 
enough. Some of the skill in making decisions is changing courses when 
you’re sure that you’re heading the wrong directions with your recent deci-
sion. Evaluating results on regular intervals helps you decide when it’s time 
to change course. It’s like in golf: The marginal shots won’t kill your round, 
but the poor shots cost you big strokes. The shot that follows the poor shot 
matters significantly. Make sure you give your project enough time to have a 
chance to succeed, though — try making minor adjustments before scrapping 
your decision altogether.

182
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Here are some questions to ask in the short term to see whether a change is 
warranted:
 
 How is the result measuring up to your expectations?
 
 Are you achieving the objectives you outlined in advance?
 
 How could you improve the results that you’re trying to achieve?
 
 If you knew at the beginning what you know now, would you have still 
selected this course of action?
 
 If you were to make a change, what would that be?
 
 What result would be worth making a change? What are the odds that 
change will lead to the desired result?
Refining Your Approach According 
to Your Behavioral Profile
Everyone reacts differently in situations that require important decisions. 
Some people are naturally more comfortable taking risks and don’t need a lot 
of data to back up their decisions. Others need a much more detailed analy-
sis of the facts before acting. There’s no right or wrong way to be. But know-
ing your DISC behavioral profile — a report on your behavioral styles and 
preferences — can help you understand your own natural tendencies.
DISC is an acronym for Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Compliance. Most 
people who take the DISC assessment score high in two or three areas, which 
point you to the common weaknesses people with similar behavior patterns 
often have. Your DISC score provides a realistic picture of how you tend to 
react to stressful situations, how much data you need to make a decision, and 
the pace you like to work at.
 
Whether or not you realize it, your DISC style — and the styles of others you 
live and work with — comes out full-force in complex situations, when the 
pressure is on and the decisions you make carry a lot of weight. When you’re 
behind on bills, overwhelmed by a project, or have problems at home, your 
natural tendencies can lead you into some poor decisions. Understanding 
your DISC style helps you recognize mistakes and adjust your behavior before 
it’s too late. You can establish rules to keep yourself on track and refine your 
decision-making skills.
 
On the Web site for my company, Sales Champions, I offer a free DISC assessment 
that you’re welcome to use. Go to www.saleschampions.com/freedisc and 
answer the 12 questions — it takes less than ten minutes. This gives you basic 
knowledge of your core behavioral style. No matter what career field you’re in, 
knowing your behavioral style can help you perform better.

183
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
This section helps you understand those four main DISC scores and guides 
you in understanding your own natural tendencies. You also gain insight 
into how people with different styles are likely to react to the same set of 
circumstances.
 
I’m a Dominant Influencer, which means I’m inclined to seek out risk. But 
I’ve learned I need someone to slow me down. Thankfully, my wife, Joan, is a 
Steady, gifted at researching the details that I once thought of as minutiae but 
are extremely valuable to making sound decisions. I would’ve made far fewer 
mistakes in life and business if I’d understood this earlier in our marriage. 
The high Dominant
Dominance measures how you respond to problems and challenges. People 
who score high on this aspect tend to be assertive, direct, focused, and 
driven. They’re more inclined to go with their gut than the advice of other 
people, and they make decisions quickly based on the results or the net 
bottom line.
The high Dominant person is also commonly referred to as the driver or direc-
tor. The Dominance factor causes these people to make decisions that are 
bold and risk-oriented. These people are confident, decisive, competitive, 
aggressive, and at times demanding. They desire a challenge, so they’re well 
stimulated and can look back and exclaim, “Look what I accomplished.”
Their focus is the bottom line, the result, the achievement of their goal. If the 
actions or decisions don’t lead to the result, Dominants usually try to omit 
them. Dominants are bottom-line organizers, so what they do needs less 
paperwork, and unnecessary steps get cut out from the process.
Dominants are self-motivated. They get to the office early, stay later, and pay 
almost any price necessary to achieve the success that they desire. They’ll 
work long and hard to make it happen.
The natural tendencies of a Dominant are to be direct, aggressive, and 
pointed in their decision-making and fast-paced both in speech and deci-
sions. Dominant people have short decision cycles, little fear if a problem or 
unforeseen challenge arises, high ego strength, and desire to achieve bottom-
line results.
 
As a high Dominant, you need to use the strength of conviction and good 
instincts but slow down enough to get the facts to support your gut. If you 
score high in the Dominance category, take extra care to thoroughly assess 
the data about your options and consider potential downsides of each of them 
before making a decision.

184
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
The high Influencer
Influence measures how you respond to people. A high score on Influence 
often reveals people who are fun, engaging, talkative, and optimistic about 
the outcome of the decisions they make. They base their decisions on emo-
tion (some call it intuition) and are swayed by how they feel about a certain 
situation or problem.
The high Influencer is also considered expressive, sanguine, enthusiastic, 
gregarious, persuasive, optimistic, personable, and popular. Influencers want 
to make whatever they engage in fun. Decisions need to present fun options 
and fun opportunities.
High Influencers exude optimism and enthusiasm for life and their jobs. 
When the road becomes challenging or the decision is especially complex, 
the optimism for a positive outcome carries them through. High influencers 
are also highly emotional. This means that their feelings and emotions can 
influence their actions heavily.
High Influencers need to interact and verbalize. They need to talk out a deci-
sion with themselves or with others. When they’re talking it out with others, 
they’re looking for agreement, excitement, and optimism out of the other 
party.
High Influencers crave public recognition. They want to be liked by others. 
They connect and build a high level of trust in others quickly and easily. 
They also transfer trust (often indiscriminately) to others, so they can be 
taken advantage of as well. A smooth talker with a great presentation can talk 
them into decisions. The trust level goes up, their guard goes down, and they 
just decided to join a monastery in Tibet overnight.
The natural tendencies of an Influencer are to be outgoing, highly relational, 
social, verbally persuasive, and fast-paced but friendly. The lack of research 
for an influencer is legendary. “If it feels good, do it” is their motto.
The trajectory of DISC
DISC is a universal language of people obser-
vation, measuring how humans act and react 
in certain situations. The four-point behavioral 
profile has evolved from roots that stretch as 
far back as Empedocles’ discoveries in 444 
BCE. Hippocrates refined DISC in 440 BCE 
to four humors, or temperaments: sanguine, 
melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic. In 1928, 
Harvard doctoral graduate Dr. William Marston 
published his landmark book, The Emotions of 
Normal People, to establish the more modern 
version that DISC theory uses today. Today, 
hundreds of thousands of companies use DISC 
in their biggest hiring decisions.

185
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
 
If you’re a high Influencer, establish boundaries to protect yourself. Build 
rules, such as allowing yourself to make a large purchase only after a 24-hour 
waiting period or discussing it with someone else. Or have someone check 
your ideas and thoughts before you take action, preferably a Steady (see the 
next section). The truth is that Influencers need a system to slow them down.
The high Steady
Steadiness measures how you respond to the pace of things going on around 
you. People who score high in steadiness tend to be very methodical and cau-
tious in their approach to any goal. They have a process that works well for 
them, and they don’t want to be hurried into deciding or taking action. When 
allowed to operate at their own pace, they’re relaxed and extremely patient.
The high Steady is often called a relater or amiable. These people make their 
decisions through patience, persistence, and sincerity. They possess good 
listening skills because of their high desire to serve people around them. They 
want to get opinions not to raise their status because they really desire the 
input. They’re more laid back and low stress when making most decisions. But 
when the stress of making a decision becomes extreme, Steadies retreat into 
their shells and won’t come out even if a nuclear holocaust is upon them.
Steadies are more behind-the-scenes people. They’re there to do what’s best 
for their family, clients, co-workers, and company before themselves. They 
put themselves last in any decision — that is, until they reach their limit. 
When that happens, it’s like Mount Vesuvius erupting. 
After Steadies make a decision, they’re unbending. High Steadies desire comple-
tion. They want to finish what they start. They want to see their decision to the 
end. They may cling to a bad decision for too long before they enact change.
Steadies tend to be structured, take few risks, and are predictable in their 
process to making decisions. They’re persistent, organized, unemotional, 
slow to adjust, slow-paced, and conflict-avoidant in gathering and evaluating 
facts. In the decision process, these people get neither too high nor too low 
as they work toward the final decision.
These people are outstanding researchers. They often get the task of gather-
ing information so another person or team can make the decision. However, 
Steadies may feel pressured to act. They may do solid research but be out of 
connection with the team because the team is ready to go and the Steadies 
are still uncomfortable. Steadies are still people-oriented, so working with 
others can mean the deliberation process is extreme.
 
If you’re a high Steady, recognize that if other people are involved in the deci-
sion, you may have problems convincing them of the validity of your conclu-
sions because of your lack of excitement. This is especially true if you’re in a 
new position without a track record.

186
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
 
If you have a high score in Steadiness, remember that sometimes change 
is necessary, so you may need to change the course you’re on from time to 
time. Whenever you’re feeling stressed, be careful to step back and evaluate 
your circumstances and decide whether the best approach to continue with 
is a different one.
The high Compliant
Compliance measures how you respond to rules and procedures set by 
others. High scorers in compliance are often precise, detail-oriented, and 
committed to accuracy. Their fear of being wrong is extreme, and it often 
sends them back to gather more data. The decision-making procedure is slow 
and methodical. They use their level of accuracy, diplomacy, systemization, 
and high personal standards to make the exact right decision.
They meticulously plan their decision process, questions, auxiliary informa-
tion, evaluations, and spreadsheets, odds of success, risk, and organization 
before they make the final choice. For a high Compliant, a 95 percent score 
leaves too many variables to begin. The risk of a negative outcome is too high.
Compliants are polite and courteous in their approach. These people are 
guarded, accurate, careful, thoughtful questioners, reliant on lots of support 
materials, patient, objective, and thorough. They’re naturally introverted, so 
they’re more task-oriented rather than relationship-driven.
 
If you’re a high Compliant, you’ll need to force yourself to define exactly what 
information, data, evaluations, and input you need in order to feel confident 
that you’ve made the right decision. As you come closer to decision-making 
time, be careful not to become obsessive in your search for information, 
which is often a subconscious ploy to avoid making the decision. To avoid this 
trap, you must establish in advance the who, what, when, how, and how long, 
so you get only the information that you need and then make your call.
Seeking Counsel When You’re Stuck
Consequences are real, so depending on the size and scope of the decision 
you’re facing, your fear of facing the consequences of a wrong choice is only 
natural. You may realize you don’t have or know how to get all the informa-
tion you need to make an informed decision. Or maybe life has thrown a 
wrench into your best-laid plan and now you’re uncertain of your next move. 
For whatever reason, you’re stuck.
 
Before you get off track or into a tight spot, try to identify a number of people 
who have faced the kind of challenges you’re facing. You can call on any one of 
them when you need a reality check, expert advice, or simply a sounding board.

187
 Chapter 11: Making Wise Yet Quick Decisions
Learning from others’ successes — 
or failures
Sometimes the most valuable role another person can play in your success 
is as an example of what works — or doesn’t. You can discover an enormous 
amount by studying the lessons other people have learned, often through 
much trial and error. 
 
Trial and error is the most expensive way to learn, in terms of time, money, 
effort, and emotion. So why reinvent the wheel? Chances are excellent that 
someone else has already paved the way to the solution you need. Study the 
decisions of successful people you admire and discover a wealth of guidance 
in all areas of life — from business to personal well-being — that you can 
easily apply to your own life. Most people who write an autobiography share 
their successes and failures, leaving a pathway for you to follow or warnings 
to be heeded. 
Frequently, you can discover more from defeat than from victory. If you watch 
others closely, you can see what not to do, which is often more valuable than 
knowing what to do.
 
Just because other people failed doesn’t automatically mean that an idea, 
strategy, or system doesn’t work. Consider the following four factors to make 
sure failure is still the most likely outcome:
 
 Timing: Sometimes the timing is off on a decision or project. The timing 
was too early or too late, so they didn’t achieve results due to timing 
problems.
 
 Implementation: The decision to act was right but the planning of the 
action was lacking. Maybe they didn’t think out the details of the plan 
enough to achieve success, or perhaps the plan was out of order. Maybe 
the individual steps were out of order, so the decision was destined to fail.
 
 The person applying the plan: You can have the right decision, the 
right timing, the right plan, and the right steps, and still see someone 
fail. The failure may occur in that the person who’s leading the execu-
tion is the wrong person with the wrong skills.
 
 Duration: Persistence to a plan is a prerequisite to success. Often, people 
quit before they really know whether their decision will work as planned 
or whether they need an adjustment. This wastes unbelievable amounts 
of time. Most people in business quit before they’ve made slight adjust-
ments to the plan and execution of their decision. In business with a new 
strategy, marketing, sales, management, personnel, and customer service, 
you need a handful of months to really know if something works. It takes 
that long to collect the data to be sure of your decision. When you’re 
observing other people’s failures, ask whether they gave their decision 
or plan sufficient time to triumph.

188
Part III: Confronting Challenges to Time Management 
Getting a different perspective 
on similar situations
New ideas are fundamental to growth. You don’t always have the best ones 
alone. Sometimes you’re too close to the situation to have the right solution 
for your challenges and decisions. You’re unable to see all the moving parts. 
You can be emotionally attached to the outcome and let what you want to 
see influence your judgment of what you’re likely to see.
It’s very easy to get so close to a situation that you literally can’t see it any-
more. In that case, a fresh perspective can be just the ticket you need to get 
back on track. Cultivate the ability to think outside the box by becoming a 
student of other people’s ideas. Often, one good idea linked with a decision 
to take action is all you need to create a fortune in life. Resolve to read more, 
listen to more motivational and business CDs, attend more seminars, and 
brainstorm with other people. Here are a few of my favorite books:
 
 Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill
 
 Focal Point by Brian Tracy
 
 The Power of Positive Thinking by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale
Turning to a mentor or coach 
for strategizing help
Many of the world’s most successful people have benefited from having a 
mentor. Why not ask a more experienced friend or teacher to share his or her 
experience with you? Some schools and professions have mentoring programs, 
pairing newcomers with more experienced colleagues who guide you along the 
road to advancement.
Hiring a personal or business coach is another option. In addition to helping

n the world of business, there’s no hall monitor to 
tell your co-worker to stop disturbing you and go back 
to her cubicle. There’s no bell that declares the meeting 
is over. There’s no tardy notice when a client fails to 
show up for an appointment. But when you’re expected 
to perform at a certain level on your job, there are no 
excuses for less-than-acceptable work. That’s why a few 
new lessons on how to manage meetings, appointments, 
presentations, and other activities spent with colleagues, 
clients, and business associates are certain to advance 
your time management skills. Chapter 12 helps you keep 
your boss on track, and Chapter 13 gets down to the busi-
ness of meetings with co-workers — a how-to on setting 
and conducting a productive and expedient meeting. And 
finally, Chapter 14 examines how to make appointments 
with clients, present your ideas, and move the process 
along to get to yes faster.

 entered the work world prepared to be impressed by those running the 
show. Surely everyone out there knew more than I did, worked as hard as 
or harder than I did, and provided employees with everything they needed 
to perform superbly and eventually be promoted themselves. After all, that’s 
why the boss is the boss, right? However, I’ve since discovered that although 
many good bosses are out there, not every manager or supervisor is an 
employee’s dream, and even decent bosses can be poor time managers.
A boss who manages time beautifully can help make your career. But if you 
report to an inefficient Hindenburg of hot air or even a boss with only aver-
age time-management skills, you have three choices:
 
 Deal with it, knowing that your opportunities for advancement are 
likely to drop because other teams and departments can outproduce 
you. No matter how hard you work to overcome it, this situation reflects 
poorly on your skills and abilities. In addition, stress takes its toll on 
both your potential advancement and your mental and physical health.
 
 Move on, either to another department or position within your com-
pany or to another company altogether. If you switch companies, 
though, you may also leave behind benefits, vacation and personal time, 
and possibly a company that’s a good place to work.
 
 Gently and unobtrusively help your boss provide the tools you need 
to do your job in the timeframe that you need them. Accomplishing 
these goals lowers your stress, improves your work life, multiplies your 
advancement opportunities, and enhances your value to the company. 
That’s why this chapter helps you examine the impact your boss’s work 
style has on your productivity and ability to manage your time. It also 
tells you how to outline and implement an action plan to improve that 
work style if unnecessary.

Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Fulfilling Your Objectives to 
Help Your Boss Meet Hers
 
Whether you like it or not, your boss’s time is more valuable than yours. 
Delegating activities to the lowest-paid competent person — someone who 
can complete assignments as well as the boss while freeing the boss to focus 
on higher-level tasks with more expensive price tags — is a basic business 
practice. Your goal is to supply your boss with more time. The more you take 
on, the better it is for your boss and for you. Ideally, your pay increases and 
your opportunities for advancement are directly tied to how valuable you are 
to your boss, how well you support her, and how much you contribute to the 
department.
 
I coach salespeople around the globe, and I have a lot of sales clients who are 
in real estate, insurance, and financial planning. Top performers in these fields 
have assistants who work for them, and I tell the assistants that one of their 
primary jobs is to keep their bosses on task — that is, prospecting — daily. 
Many salespeople put off prospecting and try to stay busy with other tasks. I 
tell the sales assistants that the best way they can spend their time is to help 
their bosses prospect with greater consistency.
The best bosses have already assessed themselves and their staff and are 
using the information to minimize team weaknesses by maximizing every-
one’s strengths. You, of course, may not have a “best boss” — or you may 
simply have a good boss who lacks this ability or hasn’t yet figured out how 
to use it to full advantage.
Workers often expect perfection from their bosses, and vice versa. Begin by 
understanding that you and your boss are both human and that you both 
have weaknesses. That said, determining how your boss operates makes life 
easier for both of you and is essential to your success.
Sit down and look at your boss as objectively as possible. Start with some of 
the same general questions your boss answers when she completes your per-
formance appraisal, and listen for conversational clues whenever you speak 
with her:
 
 What are your boss’s long-term goals? It’s usually safe to assume that most 
people are looking for more: more money, more prestige, more challenge.
 
 What are your boss’s strengths?
 
 What are your boss’s weaknesses?
 
 What is your boss’s greatest frustration?
 
 What’s the best use of your boss’s time?

193
 Chapter 12: Coping with a Time-Wasting Boss
After you assess your boss’s situation, try to pinpoint ways you can better 
support your boss. Doing so leads to a well-oiled working relationship with 
your boss and greater productivity for you both. (And assessing someone’s 
performance is a good skill to have on your résumé — you’ll use it when 
you’re the boss!) Ask yourself these questions:
 
 How can you help alleviate your boss’s frustration?
 
 How can you help your boss spend more time on tasks that only she 
can do?
Maintaining Personal Boundaries
 
Part of being a responsible employee includes setting boundaries for yourself, 
both in regard to the allocation of your work responsibilities as well as in your 
work-life balance. That’s not to say, however, that you should be on the defen-
sive with your employer. The objective is to maintain a positive working rela-
tionship for all — you need a healthy balance between work and personal time 
in order to function most effectively, and at the same time, you need to make 
sure you’re a valuable, dependable, hard-working resource for your employer.
Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation where your employer fails 
to acknowledge your need for work-life balance — this is often the case 
when you’re working for a workaholic. Most workaholics think everyone else 
operates the same way they do. If you don’t, they may feel your level of com-
mitment doesn’t match theirs because your hours at the office aren’t at the 
(sometimes unbelievable) levels theirs are.
 
You can expect to work longer hours once in a while, depending on deadlines, 
but don’t let yourself become the office whipping boy and regularly work 
longer hours just because your boss does. Here are some solutions:
 
 Communicate reasonable expectations. Figuring out how to defend 
your boundaries is about communicating reasonable expectations so 
you don’t get burned out. At the same time, you want to convey support 
and a willingness to go the extra mile. But your goal is to make working 
overtime the exception rather than the rule. Here are some ways to tact-
fully discuss schedule concerns:
 
• “I have X projects to finish by the date you’ve given me. Is there some-
thing you want me to drop or put off so I can take on this project?”
 
• “I appreciate your confidence in me, but I know if I take on this project, 
my other responsibilities and commitments will suffer.”

194
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
• “I can do that, but I’m afraid I can’t finish it until middle of next week. 
Is that all right?”
 
• “I have a number of key projects in the queue right now. Can we talk 
about what’s most important in the next two or three weeks and bal-
ance that with what I can realistically do in that time?”
 
 Clearly establish boundaries around your personal time. Most worka-
holics continue to impose unless you actively defend your off time by 
having something planned. Treat family events as you would any work 
appointment (see Chapter 3). T-ball games, ballet classes, church activi-
ties, and even family dinners are appointments not to be missed. The 
workaholic boss doesn’t need to know more than that you’re booked — 
and unavailable.
 
 You may not be able to avoid being on call, at least once in awhile, for a 
workaholic boss. You can’t always be booked because your boss will see 
your unavailability as lack of commitment. To offset this perception, you 
may want to share details of your prior commitment, such as, “Bobby’s 
soccer team is playing the most important game of the season, and he’d 
be crushed if I weren’t there.” Other times, a simple “I already have 
plans” or “I’m committed” suffices.
 
 Know when to say no (gracefully, of course). You don’t need to take 
a Miss Manners class to discover how to say no. All you need are a few 
tried-and-true phrases. Here are a few of my favorites:
 
• “I’m committed to going to (such-and-such athletic event, birthday, or 
recital), and I can’t miss it. I promised my (son, daughter, wife, grand-
son, granddaughter, third cousin twice removed).”
 
• “I wish you’d brought this up a few days ago. I’ve committed to going 
to the symphony, and we’ve already paid for tickets.” Or “I’m sorry. 
Our family is taking an underwater basket-weaving class. We’ve 
looked forward to it for months.”
 
• “Let me get back to you tomorrow — I need to check with the family 
to see what’s planned.”
Preparing to Discuss Your 
Concerns with Your Boss
If all else fails (or if your job is rapidly becoming intolerable), you may want 
to have a serious conversation with your boss. If you’re frustrated and get-
ting more exasperated daily, approach your boss soon. Waiting until you’re 
ready to explode with rage won’t help your cause. Prepare by writing notes, if 
it helps, and then just do it.

195
 Chapter 12: Coping with a Time-Wasting Boss
Identifying concerns and gathering 
supporting evidence
Assignments usually come from the top down, and how your boss hands off 
those responsibilities can have big effects on your schedule. One of the most 
frustrating situations in business is working for a boss who procrastinates, 
dumping several to-do items on your lap at once, or one who’s a workaholic, 
expecting everyone else to push the work through. If your boss’s procras-
tination, disorganization, or overdeveloped drive for advancement (which 
may have landed your boss in his position in the first place!) is affecting 
your work or putting your career in jeopardy, try applying the following 
techniques:
 
1. Identify the problem, figuring out the who, what, where, when, how, 
and why of the issue.
 
 Look at where you’re losing the most time, and list specific examples 
that illustrate your points. Where do you notice the biggest problems? 
In planning? Advance notice? Overcommitment? Poor organization?
 
 Also make sure that you aren’t part of the problem: Are you taking 
responsibility for solving some of the problems yourself? Or are you 
waiting for someone to tell you in detail how to complete every step of 
the project?
 
2. Gather supporting facts.
 
 If your workload is unmanageable, try keeping a time sheet for a few 
weeks. Perhaps your boss is a performance bottleneck because he’s 
unrealistic about what can be done in a given time frame or because 
he can’t say no to new projects. Document hours you work on vari-
ous projects and include the time you spend on generic administrative 
tasks, such as project-related telephone calls and e-mail. Then, instead 
of saying, “Boss, I don’t have time for this new project,” you can point 
to your time sheet and say, “Look, Boss. There are 40 hours in a work 
week; to complete my current assignments, I’d have to work 80 hours 
per week for the next four months. The numbers have spoken, Boss. 
Something’s got to give!”
 
3. Describe how these problems inhibit your job performance and 
efficiency.
 
 Bring up how putting things off causes you and others in the department 
to deviate from the company’s mission statement and core values. Or 
explain how disorganization forces you to waste time with more frequent 
stops and starts to the project, along with more interruptions of your 
boss’s time because you have more questions throughout the project.

196
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
4. Devise a few viable solutions.
 
 Regardless of your boss’s strengths and weaknesses, he appreciates 
successful solutions. Staff members who point out that the company or 
department is underserving customers, losing sales to competitors, or 
wasting company dollars are a dime a dozen, but true problem-solvers 
are rare. If you have a favorite among solutions you propose, make sure 
to let your boss in on it — and be enthusiastic. If you’re right, it could 
earn you a few feathers in your cap and set you on the road to more 
responsibility and a tidy salary increase.
 
 Consider the following solutions:
 
• Can system and procedural changes improve existing processes? 
Talk about time frames and work flow, supporting your ideas with 
industry figures and statistics if you can find them. Show proof of 
typical turnaround times.
 
 Use specific examples. Cite examples of past projects when work 
flow, deadlines, and quality expectations were well-defined, and 
show how the work produced was excellent. Focusing on policies, 
procedures, and time lines is less personal and therefore less 
confrontational.
 
• Would you benefit from brief, fairly frequent meetings with your 
boss? Consider recommending that you touch base more often. 
Meetings don’t have to last 60 or even 30 minutes. Ask your boss 
to meet more often so you can “better align your work with his 
priorities.” Then use the meetings to keep ahead of the land mines 
that lie ahead.
 
 Your enthusiasm may also boost your boss’s confidence enough to act 
on your suggestions. Over time, as your boss gains confidence in your 
ability to make mid-range decisions, those decisions (and lower-level 
ones) will be delegated to you. You win twice: Your boss has fewer deci-
sions to put off making, and you have more responsibility!
 
Keep your expectations realistic. Don’t expect your boss to change. Do expect 
to be hit, at least occasionally, with fallout from his work style, and do what 
you can to work with it so you can meet your own objectives.
Reflecting on your boss’s behavior style
Before broaching project and schedule concerns with your boss, think 
through the discussion thoroughly and plan your focus. Your boss has a 
particular behavioral style that dictates how she reacts to events and situa-
tions. If you’re knowledgeable about your boss’s behavior, you can open the 

197
 Chapter 12: Coping with a Time-Wasting Boss
lines of communication and discuss how and why she makes decisions. Then, 
and only then, can you prepare for the roadblocks and one-step-backs that 
come up in any project and deal productively and positively with your boss 
throughout the process. Essentially, your boss’s behavior patterns revolve 
around the dimensions I cover in the subsections that follow.
 
You can use what you know about your boss’s values and behavior to frame 
the conversation in a way that gets your point across. For instance, if your 
boss is task-focused, position problems in terms of task accomplishment 
(“Boss, in order for this project to surpass customer expectations by X date, 
I need the following specific information: A, B, and C.”). If you report to a 
people-focused supervisor, couch your questions in softer terms (“Boss, I’m 
feeling frustrated by the way this project is going. Can we talk?”).
In addition to getting an overall perspective of your boss’s behavioral pattern 
through the sections that follow, one formal way to get a clearer picture of 
yourself and your boss’s basic tendencies is to take a validated behavioral 
assessment. I’ve made an assessment available at my Web site (www.sales
champions.com/DISC), and you and your boss can take it for free; Chapter 
8 tells you all about this DISC profile.
Focusing first on people or tasks
Is your boss people-oriented — warm, persuasive, engaged with people, and 
relying on feelings and connections with others to get things done? Or is your 
boss more oriented to facts, figures, and task lists? Here’s how these types 
compare:
 
 Task-focused managers: These people may take time to talk to subor-
dinates about issues and challenges only if the problems are seriously 
blocking progress. This can be frustrating because without direction 
or corrections, you and your co-workers may feel you’re spinning your 
wheels, doing the wrong things the wrong way (only to have to redo 
them later). The communication you have with a facts-and-figures 
boss is usually labored, infrequent, and impersonal. On the pro side: 
Task-focused managers don’t often interrupt. If you know your boss is 
task-oriented, understand that she’s driven by deadlines, results, and 
accomplishments. That doesn’t mean your boss doesn’t like people; it 
means that she focuses first on tasks and then on people.
 
 People-focused supervisors: These bosses spend more time commu-
nicating and cultivating a feeling of teamwork, and deadlines are often 
fairly fluid. Although you may feel good about your relationship with 
these bosses, the amount of work getting done is often compromised: 
Highly interactive managers can be walking, breathing interruptions.

198
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Following rules and procedures
Does your boss bend the rules or follow them absolutely? If your boss is 
strictly rules-oriented, expect quick changes to be limited.
 
Some bosses follow rules so closely and consistently that, in reality, the rules 
are ruts. Rigidity in today’s rapidly changing business world sounds a profes-
sional death knell. A boss who lacks responsiveness to change won’t be your 
boss for very long in the future. That rigidity can also put your job and career 
in jeopardy.
On the other hand, if your boss tends not to follow rules, follows them only 
sporadically, or allows employees to bend the rules to achieve desired 
results, you have other issues. If this approach has set you and your fellow 
employees up for a fall, you may be able to help your boss understand that 
some rules were made for good reasons and that sometimes following the 
rules gives you and other employees better control of your time and energy, 
allowing you to work more efficiently.
Facing problems and challenges
Is your boss risk-seeking or risk-averse? Does your boss solve problems 
aggressively, approaching them fearlessly and expecting success? Or is she 
cautious and deliberate?
Expect more changes, interruptions, short deadlines, and performance 
demands from a risk-seeking boss. How well you work with a risk-seeker 
depends on your own work style and preferences. Does this type of up-and-
down, stop-and-go make you crazy or cause you to shut down? Are you willing 
and able to handle lots of projects going at once? With the risk-taking boss, 
that’s what you get.
The risk-seeker’s opposite is the risk-averse boss, with whom problems and 
challenges usually come at a slower, more controlled pace. If your boss is risk-
averse, you probably won’t get hit with ten things today that have deadlines of 
yesterday. However, the challenge is that a risk-adverse boss is more inclined 
to fight change and protect the status quo. When change is imminent, then 
the time left to make the change will be shorter because so much energy was 
invested in the-way-we’ve-always-done-it.
Planning and tackling new projects
How does your boss respond to new projects? Does she chunk them into 
smaller, more manageable tasks, plan and delegate well, consult a calendar, 
and assign interim deadlines? Or does she leap ahead without planning, get 
stressed out, and then move from planning to implementation and back to 
planning again? Maybe your boss is a combination or is a complete maverick 
in how she approaches new assignments.

199
 Chapter 12: Coping with a Time-Wasting Boss
Handling pressure
How does your boss handle pressing deadlines or work overload — with 
grace or blow-ups? When pressure increases, is she paralyzed, frustrated, 
curt, lethargic, and unproductive? Or is she energized, challenged, positive, 
encouraging, and determined to meet deadlines and exceed expectations?
Pacing work
How does your boss pace her work? Does your boss work at a steady and 
predictable pace, one project at a time? Or is your boss more of a binge 
worker, varying the tasks themselves as well as the speed and intensity of 
work, laboring without break for days or weeks, then slowing down, and then 
gearing up again?
Not surprisingly, the volume of work you get from a steady worker is easy 
to manage and plan for, but the volume of work from a binge boss arrives in 
bunches. Binge bosses often commit to too many projects because they have 
unrealistic expectations of what can be accomplished in a given time.
Taking responsibility and responding to missed goals
If goals, quotas, and standards of performance are set aggressively, then 
people in the company won’t hit them all. Your boss can affect how many are 
achieved by deciding how lofty the goals, quotas, and performance standards 
will be. That’s where there can be a disconnect. When goals aren’t met, what 
does your boss do? Does she make excuses or look for scapegoats? Blame 
the marketplace, other departments, employees, the competition, or unfair 
pricing? Or does she work alongside employees to figure out solutions by 
trying new ideas, approaches, and strategies? Does your boss engage every-
one to solve problems and overcome challenges, or is her preferred style 
more autocratic?
You’ve probably already stumbled across your boss’s ego. Can you tell your 
boss that she’s wrong (or even suggest it) without bringing down a hail-
storm? If you can, your boss’s ego is probably healthy and intact but not out 
of control.
Initiating and Fostering 
a Win-Win Discussion
 
Envision the conversation about your boss’s time management from start 
to finish. Imagine the meeting as a calm, productive, successful exchange of 
information in which neither you nor your boss is unduly upset. Practicing 
the meeting in your head helps the actual meeting come closer to what you’ve 

200
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
envisioned. You may still face some bumps, but you may be surprised at how 
smoothly the meeting goes. Athletes use this technique to prepare for compe-
titions, and it works equally well in difficult interpersonal situations.
As you enter the conversation, think positive, but be prepared for a negative 
reaction. No one likes to be told, even gently or indirectly, that he or 
she lacks skills or is causing problems. Here are some tips for a productive 
conversation:
 
 Approach your boss in private. Your boss won’t hear a word you say if 
he’s losing face in front of others, regardless of whether they’re peers, 
superiors, or subordinates. I suggest setting an appointment with your 
boss to discuss a large issue like this. Don’t do it in the course of your 
normal daily or weekly meeting; your boss already has an agenda set for 
that meeting, at least mentally.
 
 Explain your concerns in a cool, calm, encouraging manner. Keep the 
dialogue work-centered. Tell your boss how delaying affects your job 
performance and outline what you could accomplish if lead times and 
decisions were more timely — or whatever the case may be.
 
 Frame your discussion in a positive I mode, using I-statements rather than 
you-statements, to make the discussion go more smoothly (“I could get 
more work done if . . .” or “I could help you so much more if . . .”). Avoid 
telling your boss how you feel, and stay away from personal attacks (“If 
only you’d . . .” or “You should be more/less . . .” or “I hate it when you . . .”). 
Though your feelings are involved, you’re discussing a performance issue.
 
 If your boss hates to be wrong — and worse, hates being told he’s 
wrong, especially by subordinates — swaddle that baby in soft flannel: 
“Boss? Jimmy Jones said he already gave you those sales charts you 
were looking for last week. But maybe he’s mistaken.”
 
 Avoid nagging your boss. Remaining encouraging for extended periods 
of time without becoming impatient or critical can be difficult, but try. 
Nagging can put your job at risk.
 
 Present possible solutions and solicit some from your boss, even if 
you think you have the solution nailed. People buy into solutions more 
fully if they’ve helped develop them. Ask what you can do to help. Offer 
to take some items off your boss’s plate so he can devote more time to 
decision-making.
 
 Close the discussion by assuring your boss that you’re a team player 
and that you want to do the best job for him, as well as for the 
company and its customers. Be clear that you want to support your 
boss’s goals and objectives, not undermine them. Tell your boss that 
you realize your advancement is linked to his and that your job is to 
make your boss look good. Ask your boss to help you do that to the 
best of your ability.

201
 Chapter 12: Coping with a Time-Wasting Boss
 
Watch other employees in your department. Does anyone seem to handle your 
boss’s ego more capably than anyone else? Study that person’s technique and 
try it yourself.
Irreconcilable Differences: Knowing 
When to Move On
If you find that your work style is drastically different from that of your boss 
and it’s impossible for you (or your boss) to adjust, you may have to bite 
the bullet and look for another job and a boss whose time-management style 
is more in tune with yours. If you’ve checked yourself and can honestly say 
you’re doing everything in your power to make the situation better, accept 
that your job may require you to take on more responsibility than your job 
title, skills, and even your experience warrant.
 
A few years ago, I hired Clara as my assistant. Although I explained my work 
style to Clara before she came on board, she spent the first six weeks on the 
job trying to change me. (I fall into the risk-taker category: I have lots of proj-
ects, ideas, and deadlines going at all times). Finally, after weeks of frustration, 
Clara told me she needed materials four weeks in advance of a speaking event 
or she couldn’t guarantee that my workbooks and presentation slides would 
be finished. I tried to adjust my work style to meet Clara’s request for addi-
tional time, but in the end, we agreed that our work styles were incompatible, 
and Clara left to find employment elsewhere.

I
f you regard meetings as a massive waste of time, then read on. You’re 
in good company if meeting invitations cause your stomach to tie up 
in knots and your blood to pressure to climb a little higher. That feeling 
may arise because you know you’ll walk out with more projects on your 
already overflowing plate. Or because your day is so packed with to-dos that 
squeezing in one more commitment is certain to push you over the edge. Or 
because you know from experience that you’ll find yourself a prisoner of the 
Meeting That Wouldn’t Die.
Sadly, meetings with colleagues, co-workers, and corporate minions — as 
well as appointments with clients, customers, vendors, and so on — are an 
important part of business life. Meetings aid in the communication of critical 
issues, stimulate needed action, and help measure and maintain progress. 
But far too often, the meeting is overused, confused, and abused, leading to 
gross inefficiencies and wastes of time. I can’t help you make meetings go 
away, but I can offer strategies to tame them from wild time-predators into a 
manageable and even productive part of your job.
Your meetings may be ones that you set and manage, or they may be 
appointments that someone else is eager to arrange with you. The initiator 
starts out with a little more control of the situation simply because he or she 
is setting the appointment, but just because you’re the invitee doesn’t mean 
you have to relinquish control or time. Regardless of whether you’re lead-
ing the meeting or simply participating in it, this chapter gives you valuable 
strategies and tactics that you can use before, during, and after meetings to 
make them more valuable and less time-consuming.

204
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Devising Objectives, Listing Attendees, 
and Crafting an Agenda
When I’m the one calling a meeting, I adhere to a strategy, supported by 
research, of investing twice the time in preparation as the length of the meet-
ing. If the meeting is scheduled for an hour, I put in approximately two hours. 
This section explains how you can best fill that prep time.
Clarifying the purpose of the meeting
Before you schedule a meeting, get your arms around the big picture and 
consider all the specifics. Begin your preparations by starting with the goal 
and working backward. What outcome do you desire for this meeting? How 
are you most likely to arrive at that outcome?
At first consideration, you may think that if you’re the one asking for the meet-
ing, you automatically have a good handle on why you need to meet. Sure, you 
may know that you want to get to the bottom of the service problems you’re 
having with your office supplies vendor, but chances are you have a ways to 
go before you’ve crystallized the situation and how you can to resolve it.
So give the purpose of the meeting careful thought. Start with the motivating 
factor for the action. Is it to get to the bottom of the service problems with 
your vendor? Really? Do you just want to understand the problems, or would 
you rather clear up the problem at the conclusion of the meeting?
 
Be clear with yourself about what you want to walk away with. Put it into as 
precise a framework as possible, identifying the action you seek and when 
you want it accomplished. The questions you ask yourself before the meeting 
really increase its effectiveness and efficiency. Here’s the need-to-know info:
 
 What’s the problem or goal?
 
 How do you want it resolved or accomplished?
 
 What do the parties involved have to do to make that happen?
 
 When should this action be accomplished?
Look at the difference between the following two statements of purpose; the 
second includes the proper amount of detail:
“Hi, Mary. I’d like to meet with you to discuss the problems we’ve been 
having with your service department.”
“Hi, Mary. We’ve been having some issues with prompt service calls from 
your company for the past three months. I’d like to meet with you so we

can clear up any barriers that may be causing this problem and get back on 
track with on-time response within the next two weeks.”
Often, while working through the process of clarifying the purpose of the 
meeting, you may discover other ways to address the issue you want to meet 
about. This exercise may help you realize that a phone call or other action 
can resolve the situation — without holding a meeting at all.
Creating a guest list
 
For the most effective meetings, keep the size to as few people as necessary 
to accomplish the goal of the gathering. Numerous studies show that five to 
eight is the ideal number of participants for a productive meeting. Of course, 
the subject matter often dictates the number of people who attend a meeting, 
but I agree that as soon as the number of attendees climbs above eight or ten, 
the return on time investment begins to decline rapidly. In addition to taking 
more people away from their primary duties, the larger number increases 
unproductive discussion.
 
The individuals invited should be able to represent others and assume the 
responsibility of communicating the results of the meeting to those people. Don’t 
invite someone just because he or she would be offended not to be included.
Given a limited number of meeting participants, you want to make sure that 
everyone who must be at the meeting is invited. Depending on the purpose and 
topic of your meeting, consider these criteria when making out the guest list:
 
 Have you included people who have the information or answers to 
critical questions?
 
 Did you invite those in a position to authorize decisions required to 
move ahead?
 
 Have you considered representatives from each of the departments or 
areas that will be affected or play a role in the outcome of the meeting?
 
 Did you include someone who can take notes and communicate the details 
of the meeting to attendees and others who aren’t part of the meeting?
 
 Official minutes — a detailed chronological record of everything that hap-
pened during the meeting — may not be necessary, especially if meetings 
involve few participants. But at the very least, you should invite someone 
you can assign to take notes. I suggest giving that responsibility to some-
one else so the host can focus on shepherding the meeting to its produc-
tive conclusion. Here’s what the notes should capture:
 
• Key discussion points
 
• Significant concerns or unresolved questions
 
• The action items and all details surrounding them

206
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
While considering the right people to invite, give some thought to the wrong 
people as well. Don’t weigh down the invite list with redundants — people 
representing the same area or interest. When you have a choice of two people, 
consider their communication styles and which candidate may be more com-
patible to the meeting environment: the co-worker who likes to hold forth with 
filibuster-length pronouncements or the colleague whose contributions add 
value to the discussion?
Holding informal, preliminary 
mini-meetings
Setting up a meeting to discuss a meeting? Okay, before you declare me cer-
tifiably insane from meeting overload, hear me out: Prep work is all about 
keeping the meeting as short and focused as possible. The better you pre-
pare, the more you accomplish in less time. So yes, if a quick mini-meeting 
improves the outcome of the big meeting (such as if the project you’re work-
ing on is complex or if you’ll have multiple presenters at the meeting), it’s 
worth the effort.
Here’s how it works: Say you’ve set a meeting with eight co-workers to talk 
about a project that involves multiple departments. You anticipate some of 
the attendees may resist the proposals you plan to present. Instead of walk-
ing into the meeting and spending some or all of it defending your program or 
Meeting overload in the United States
Is the United States a nation on a fast track to 
meeting meltdown? Have meetings overtaken 
the world of business like some invasive corpo-
rate kudzu? Consider these findings:
  The average professional employee spends 
approximately 1.7 hours per day in meetings, 
according to 3M Meetings Management 
Institute.
  Executive employees spend close to 50 per-
cent of their time in meetings.
  In any given day, more than 17 million meet-
ings are underway in the United States.
  The most productive meetings take less 
than one hour, but the average meeting 
length is two hours.
  In a survey by Microsoft, participants 
felt that 71 percent of the meetings they 
attended were unproductive.
  In a survey conducted by MCI Conferencing, 
91 percent of the participants admitted to 
daydreaming in meetings, and 39 percent 
had actually dozed off during a meeting.
  The same survey showed that 73 percent 
had brought other work to a meeting.

207
 Chapter 13: Mastering Meetings with Co-Workers
deflecting criticism, meet informally with just a couple of the participants at a 
time; getting feedback from people you trust is a helpful way to fine-tune your 
planning. Share with them a preview of your intent for the meeting and ask 
for their feedback — even proactively ask them to play devil’s advocate and 
point out what they think some of the challenges may be. That 15 minutes or 
so that you spend with each key person helps you identify the curveballs that 
would’ve been thrown your way during the meeting — you can now prepare 
a response to them. And believe it or not, you’ve gained support from those 
attendees. Because you sought them out for their input, they’re more likely 
to support your plan, particularly if you take their concerns into account.
 
Mini-meetings are best set for a week in advance. This allows you to adjust 
the agenda, revise your presentation, and be better prepared for reactions. 
Face-to-face meetings are advisable when possible, though they aren’t always 
practical, so use your best judgment. You don’t have to schedule a formal 
meeting; stand-up conversations or quick sit-downs in your office or theirs 
work well. (Chapter 8 provides insight on choosing the best medium for your 
message.)
Putting together the agenda
A tailor-made agenda allows you to proceed in the most direct path with the 
fewest distractions. Here’s the process you follow to ensure that your agenda 
provides all the pertinent details:
 
1. Create a detailed outline for the meeting.
 
 Although the purpose of the meeting determines the agenda, all agendas 
contain some consistent elements:
 
• An agenda begins with greeting and introducing all the participants 
as well as reviewing housekeeping issues, such as the length of the 
meeting and who’s taking notes.
 
• It reviews the goals, ensuring that everyone understands the pur-
pose of the meeting and what the expected outcome is.
 
• At the conclusion of the meeting, the action items cover any follow-
up activity expected of the participants.
 
 Components of the agenda need to be specific. Don’t just have an agenda 
that has “old business” and “new business.” List the projects and discus-
sion points as well as any interim decisions that need to be made. Be sure 
to use a format that identifies main topics, subtopics, and then action 
points in outline format. Providing detail helps spark ideas and conveys 
to the attendees that to get through everything, the conversation has to 
keep moving.

208
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 Try to keep the agenda to a single page. Like a résumé, you want to com-
municate that there’s substance but not overwhelm the readers with so 
much detail that their eyes glaze over.
 
2. Clarify which items on the agenda are reports or presentations and 
which are discussions.
 
 Make these notes in the margin of the document for all to see.
 
3. Assign a time limit for each agenda item.
 
 Printing it on the agenda helps participants adhere to the times. Again, 
you can place this info in the margin so all attendees know the expected 
time you’re granting to this issue.
Say you’re discussing the launch of a company-wide environmental initiative. 
A solid agenda may look like the example in Figure 13-1.
 
Send out the agenda a few days before the meeting, giving invitees at least a 
day to review it. This allows them to request that you add to or change the 
agenda based on information you may not have had. It also gives you a heads-
up if any items have sparked a bit of controversy — you’re better prepared to 
head off problems if you’re aware ahead of time.

Scheduling the Time and Place
Smart scheduling can go a long way toward maximizing time effectiveness 
when setting up business meetings. Issues such as where and when to meet 
can determine whether a meeting takes a huge chomp or a small nibble out 
of your day.
How far in advance of the meeting you send out the invitations depends on 
the type of meeting that you’re holding. If this is a once-per-year, all-company 
meeting, then 6 months in advance may be necessary. If this is a 2-person 
check-up meeting, 24 hours to 2 days may be enough. If other people are pre-
senting and you need to allow more lead time so they can prepare, you may 
need a week. As with all decisions, use your best judgment.
Choosing a teleconferencing company
As business is increasingly conducted on a 
global basis, face-to-face meetings are rapidly 
becoming the exception rather than the rule. 
And that’s a good thing. It reduces the expense 
and time of travel, not to mention the heavy 
carbon footprint on the environment.
Although nothing can replicate a face-to-face 
encounter, video, telephone, and Internet 
conferencing technology continue to improve 
so that a meeting with colleagues scattered 
around the world is literally as easy as pressing 
a button.
A number of teleconferencing companies, 
such as Sparks Communications and Excel 
Conferencing, facilitate such global exchanges. 
Services vary from company to company in 
quality, security, recording, and a host of other 
features. When choosing a teleconferencing 
service, think about features such as these:
  Digital recording, so you can capture the 
conversation and share it with others; some 
services offer that service for a nominal 
fee
  Multiple codes, so you can conduct more 
than one conference at a time using a 
universally known company-wide phone 
number
  A security feature to announce all attend-
ees before they’re placed in conference, 
keeping out uninvited guests and prevent-
ing eavesdropping on proprietary calls
Another way to expand your capabilities is 
with an online conference service such as 
GoToMeeting (www.gotomeeting.com) or 
WebEx (webex.com). These services enable 
you to operate a PowerPoint presentation from 
a centralized location and control a slide show 
on hundreds of computers around the world. 
You still need to be on a conference line and 
have audio with a WebEx-type platform, but 
you simply mute the call, and only the people 
who dial in with the host code or codes can be 
heard. That allows you to be interactive with-
out the risk of having someone ruin the call for 
others, alleviating the problem of background 
noise from 500 people. It also allows you to 
screen questions because you’re the only one 
who sees them. Each participant can log in, 
interact, ask questions, and make comments 
without uttering a word.

Finding a good time slot
For internal meetings, the best time to schedule them is before lunch or 
before the end of the day; with lunch or home on the horizon, people tend to 
be a bit more efficient and less likely to drag down a meeting with wandering 
discussions, lengthy oratories, and micro-debate. Be careful, though, how far 
before or after lunch you hold the meeting. Here’s some advice: 
 
 Schedule meetings for mid-morning or close to lunch, not first thing in 
the morning. The most productive time for most people is early in the 
morning. That’s when most people have the highest level of energy and 
focus. My view is that most internal meetings in a company don’t require 
that level of focus. Employees need that time to tackle the priorities for 
the day.
 
 Schedule meetings mid-afternoon or near the end of the workday, not 
right after lunch. Many people suffer from a little lethargy in the early 
afternoon after the midday meal. After the body is fed, the brain is more 
focused on digestion than discussion. Better your attendees spend this 
slow time answering e-mail or dealing with paperwork than dozing off in 
the middle of your meeting.
 
For meetings, don’t make the mistake of doing a pitch-in — pitch-ins tend to 
drift into recipe discussions. I’d even advise against having lunch brought in. 
Why? Somehow in these situations, the food seems to take over. There’s always 
someone who didn’t get what they requested, and others’ orders are mixed up.
If your guest list is small, you’re meeting with an outside vendor or a client 
with a service problem, or you need to be off-site with other managers or 
employees of your company, you may find that a business lunch is best. 
Lunch meetings can be very productive. The meeting leader can introduce 
the topics, present reports, or provide updates while the rest of the attend-
ees are attending to their pastrami and potato salad. No one’s distracted 
by hunger, and the eating part is usually fairly short before the lunch stuff 
is cleared away and everyone gives the meeting undivided attention. Also, 
being off-site has its advantages in lowering the distraction factor — office 
emergencies tend not to find you as easily. One caveat of lunch meetings: The 
more relaxed environment may lead to a longer meeting, so be sure to weigh 
your priorities before scheduling.
Considering the location
If all the attendees are in one place, your choice about location is simple: 
Meet wherever you have the space and resources you need. Most companies 
have a few conference rooms of varying sizes, so meeting space is rarely a 
problem. Choose a location that’s large enough for your group, and make 
sure any equipment you need is available.

211
 Chapter 13: Mastering Meetings with Co-Workers
 
You don’t have to hold a meeting in a traditional location if other options are 
available. For instance, if you’re meeting about problems on the production 
line, you may meet in the plant for a walk-through before sequestering your-
selves in a quieter spot. Do choose such a location with care, though — the 
location you choose needs to foster a good environment for achieving the 
objectives of the meeting. Your goal is to schedule and run a meeting that’s as 
efficient and short as possible. If the logistics get complicated, you defeat your 
purpose.
If you’re the invitee, ask whether you can have an agenda in advance so you 
can better prepare. Review the agenda in advance, and based on the topics 
and subtopics of the meeting, determine what relates directly to your job, 
customers, and department. 
If you’re not leading the meeting, you still have responsibilities before, 
during, and after the meeting. If everyone comes prepared, the value of the 
meeting increases while the time you spend at the meeting decreases. Here 
are some general questions to review and even craft responses for:
 
 What are the most important agenda items as they relate to your job?
 
 Have you found specific solutions to the issues that’ll be presented?
 
 What do you have to share to help the department, your company, and 
your co-workers for each agenda item?
 
 Are you or your department having problems that relate to the issues on 
the agenda?
 
 Can you take on projects that’ll help out and advance your career? 
Which projects?
The Day Of: Running the Meeting Well
The secret to holding a productive meeting that eats up the least amount 
of time is half in the planning and half in the organization and facilitation. If 
you’re the meeting initiator, it’s up to you to grab the old bull by the horns 
and stay in the saddle. If you’re not the one holding the reins, help the meet-
ing stay on track by only bringing up issues that align with the agenda. If an 
open dialogue time is part of the meeting, save your off-the-agenda problem 
for then. You may even go to the meeting initiator in advance to see whether 
your item can be placed on the agenda.
 
Being on time, prepared, and engaged is the best help that any attendee can 
give to the meeting leader. If the meeting has openings for discussion on 
issues, then chime in with something of value. My best advice is to be brief, 
bright, and concise. You win more points and respect if you’re prepared and 
on point rather than rambling. If someone else uses the meeting to talk about 

212
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
nothing, help the leader guide that person back in the fold, perhaps by pointing 
out that time is short and that the meeting is running over. The more you can 
support the leader, the better the meeting will flow and the less time it’ll take.
Arriving early for set-up
Everyone’s suffered through this scenario: The meeting host starts his pre-
sentation and the PowerPoint won’t work. There’s a problem with the laptop 
connection. The videoconferencing equipment is down. So you wait while 
someone runs to get the tech people to fix it. The minutes tick off and you’re 
ticked off at the host for wasting your valuable time.
Here are some ways to make sure your meeting’s ready to go:
 
 Get to the meeting room early to test out all the equipment. If some-
thing’s not working, you still have time to get the tech people in to work 
out the bugs. You may be able to delegate this testing, but that depends 
on the competency level of the staff. I generally arrive between 60 to 90 
minutes early so I can test all the audio-visual equipment personally.
 
 If the meeting is off-site, are people available to help you set up? If 
you’ve used the venue before, did the staff previously handle the 
logistics capably?
 
 Be sure to have the needed charts, graphs, handouts, and any other 
material critical to your presentation. Bring extra copies of handouts or 
other items that attendees may forget.
 
 You may want to check the heating or air-conditioning system. That 
way, you can be sure participants won’t be leaving the room for their 
sweaters or opening the door to get a breeze.
Launching the meeting
 
No matter the meeting’s length or formality, the most important rule to 
launching your meeting off right is to start on time. Even if some of the folks 
haven’t yet arrived. Even if your boss hasn’t arrived. If your office environ-
ment is one in which start times aren’t respected and attendees walk in 10, 15 
minutes late, resolve to do your part to reeducate your people.
How you launch the meeting has a lot to do with your success in maintaining 
control. If the meeting is with a customer, client, or prospect, you may want 
to allow for a little more small talk, but otherwise dispense with the chitchat 
before the meeting begins. Suggest that if people want to catch up, they 
should come early.

213
 Chapter 13: Mastering Meetings with Co-Workers
 
Begin by taking five minutes to establish the ground rules:
 
 Define the main purpose and objectives quickly.
 
 Make sure an agenda is visible to all attendees. When attendees can 
follow the flow, you have fewer distractions and interruptions.
 
 Tell the group what you want to have accomplished by the time you end 
the meeting at the appointed time.
 
 Explain whether attendees should hold questions until a certain point 
on the agenda.
 
 If you have a large number of attendees and are concerned that some 
members will hold the floor, advise the group of discussion guidelines. 
For example, you may want to explain that everyone will have an oppor-
tunity to speak, but each person can hold the floor for only three min-
utes at a time before someone else gets to speak.
 
 If your meeting is scheduled for longer than an hour, plan for a break 
and let the attendees know about it. If everyone knows they’ll get a 
bio-break at a given point on the agenda, it’ll help reduce walkouts that 
Dealing with habitual latecomers
If attendees typically arrive at meetings late, 
deal with the problem head-on: Talk with the 
culprits individually. Visit habitual latecomers 
before the meeting to make sure they arrive 
on time, or chat with them after the meet-
ing and ask for their cooperation in arranging 
their schedule so they can arrive on time in the 
future. If that doesn’t work, you may have to 
resort to stronger action:
  Reward early attendees. Give the on-time 
people single gifts of company logo wear, 
coffee cups, movie tickets, or coffee shop 
gift cards.
  Hand out the most desirable projects or 
assignments in the first five minutes, leav-
ing the tougher or less desirable assign-
ments to the tardy people.
  Create a late-meeting fund. Latecomers 
have to kick in some cash to the kitty. I sug-
gest making the late fee enough to cause 
a bit of pain but not a financial hardship. 
Depending on your work environment, this 
may be $5 or $100. Asking people to pay up 
can be touchy, but if you have a relatively 
informal environment, you can establish 
that late funds go to the company’s char-
ity of choice or have the money go toward 
coffee and doughnuts for the department.
  When the appointed time for the meeting 
arrives, lock the door. This suggestion isn’t 
for the faint at heart — you’re sending the 
message loud and clear, preventing late-
comers from slipping in under the radar. 
Latecomers either have to knock and ask 
to be let in or must return to their offices 
and miss the meeting.

214
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
disrupt the meeting as people leave one by one. Be sure to tell them how 
long it’ll be. (Five minutes? Ten minutes?) Then reconvene when you say 
you will.
 
 Ban cellphones and Blackberries! Allow me to climb up on my soapbox: 
I thought it was bad enough when meeting attendees kept their cell-
phones on ring and then actually carried on hushed conversations as 
the meeting was conducted around them. Now it’s worse: They’re busy 
checking messages on their Blackberries and text-messaging — who 
knows whether it’s business or personal?
 
 As part of your meeting preamble, tell the folks to turn off their cellphones 
and PDAs or whatever electronic devices and put them away. You may 
even tell them that if a phone rings during the meeting, discussion will halt 
until the phone is turned off and the interruption is concluded. This usu-
ally shames people enough so that they’re willing to adhere to the rules.
Keeping the meeting moving
 
As for smooth-running meetings, the agenda is your best friend. There’s a 
reason you come up with one: to make sure you accomplish what you set out 
to do when you scheduled the meeting. Sticking to the time parameters also 
establishes you as a person of your word and sets a positive precedent for 
future meetings, so follow the plan.
 
Your skill as a facilitator can also influence the movement of a meeting. Here 
are some tips for staying on track:
 
 Get input from participants as you go along. Your ability to ask ques-
tions and involve each participant keeps everyone engaged and the 
momentum going forward. You shouldn’t have to backtrack, because 
attendees contribute to the conversation before you move on to the next 
major topic.
 
 Don’t adjust the time given to each topic as you work through the 
agenda. This virtually guarantees that you’ll get behind and either meet 
longer than scheduled or simply not get through all the items. And you 
know what that means: another meeting!
 
 If something doesn’t look like it’ll be resolved in time, you may want to 
create a smaller group to meet and discuss solutions so you can come 
back to the larger group at an appointed time. Put that separate meeting 
on your action list and set it up at the end of the current meeting.
 
 Remind attendees of the agenda. The agenda serves as your enforcer 
when someone gets off-track or goes on a little too long. For instance, 
you can say something like the following:
 
 “Joe, you make some good points, but I promised we’d end the meet-
ing at 2 p.m., and if we’re going to get everything done, we have to 

215
 Chapter 13: Mastering Meetings with Co-Workers
stick to the agenda. I’ll make a note of your concerns to follow up 
after the meeting.”
 
 “That’s an important point — can we add it to the end of the agenda 
and discuss it if we have time left?”
 
 Never rehash, backtrack, or review to catch up late arrivals. Set the 
standard that they need to bring themselves up to speed after the con-
clusion of the meeting. It’s a monumental waste of everyone’s time to 
rehash the last ten minutes because of someone else’s lack of regard.
 
 Give attendees a ten-minute warning before the end of the meeting. 
Just as the last two minutes are critical in a football game, the last ten 
minutes of a meeting carry that level of importance. If attendees have 
been out of the game mentally, you can now grab their attention. If 
they’ve been with you the whole time, they’re alerted that it’s time to 
wrap up and focus on the conclusion.
Assigning action items
 
As the meeting leader, your job is to make sure that action items are agreed 
upon and assigned with specific instructions. Failing to assign action items 
can turn a meeting from a productive collaboration into a colossal waste of 
time. Especially when the situation is time-sensitive, you can put a project at 
great risk if no one puts the action items into action.
 
After you identify an action item, record it and either assign it then and there, 
or wait until the discussion has concluded and assign all the action items at 
once. Be sure to clarify the following:
 
 Who’s responsible for seeing that the action is fulfilled
 
 What, exactly, needs to be done
 
 When the action item must be started and completed
 
 Where the chokepoints of the project are
 
 The interim timelines for each phase of the project
 
 Who is to be notified of progress and at what points of the process
 
 The expected outcome
Don’t neglect this critical step in the meeting process. Without it, you may 
find yourself in yet another meeting revisiting the same issue — and discov-
ering that because of delay, the project is at risk.
 
If you want career advancement and an increase in income, make sure that as 
a meeting participant, you’re stepping up to volunteer for action items that 
benefit the company and group. The people who are engaged are the people 
who earn more income.

216
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Summarizing and concluding the meeting
Work in time at the end of the agenda — at least five minutes — to review 
the meeting. Your job as the meeting leader is to make sure that all attendees 
understand and accept the outcome and follow-up action from the meeting. 
In your summation, be sure to touch on these points:
 
 Key highlights of presentations and discussions
 
 All action items and to whom they’re assigned
 
 Unresolved issues and how they’ll be addressed
 
 Any follow-up activity, including setting the next meeting
Take this opportunity to ask whether anyone has questions, concerns, or 
issues he or she feels are unresolved. Your primary objective is to make sure 
everyone understands what’s been decided upon and to ensure that anyone 
with action items on his or her plate is aware and has taken ownership of 
that responsibility.
 
If the questions are very specific and do not pertain to the whole group, or 
if they’re more complex and require more time than is left in the meeting, 
simply make note of any comments and commit to addressing them after the 
meeting — this isn’t the time for continued or protracted discussion. You 
don’t want to waste the group’s time if you need a protracted discussion with 
one person. A quick judgment at this stage allows you to avoid boring others 
and wasting their time.
 
Don’t extend the meeting, even if you didn’t complete everything you’d hoped. 
Agree to set another meeting, or if a couple of people can address and resolve 
the other agenda items, suggest that those folks stay after to tie things up.
Making plans without a little fire behind them
When we were first married, Joan and I would 
talk about upcoming plans or errands we had to 
accomplish. We might discuss that we needed 
to buy charcoal for our weekend cookout, for 
example. Joan and I were always in complete 
accord in these discussions. But more often than 
not, when it came time for the cookout — and we 
were without charcoal — we’d look at each other 
and say the same thing: “I thought we agreed 
that you were going to get the charcoal.” Well, 
we had agreed — that we needed charcoal. We 
just didn’t pin down the action item and to whom 
it belonged.

217
 Chapter 13: Mastering Meetings with Co-Workers
Following Up for Maximum Productivity
 
Most people forget a large chunk of what happened at a meeting. They leave the 
meeting and walk back into their office with tasks that have piled up in the last 
hour. Their minds move to those quickly even before you’ve left the meeting 
room. That’s why you should usually plan to spend at least an hour following up 
on your meeting to ensure an effective outcome. Follow-ups should be twofold: 
communicate the results of the meeting and periodically review the status of 
action items:
 
1. Within 24 hours, distribute the meeting notes to all attendees.
 
 Send out an e-mail that summarizes the same points you made at the 
end of the meeting regarding decisions you agreed to and responsibility 
for action. By putting your understanding in writing — and requesting 
confirmation from the recipients — you further clarify what happens 
next. This way, no one can drop the ball and later on claim that that’s 
not the way he or she understood it. Be sure to give notes to any other 
employees who weren’t invited but may be affected or involved in the 
action items.
 
2. Keep an eye on the list of action items covered in the meeting and 
check in with each associated individual regularly to see how he or 
she is progressing. 
 
 Also make sure that you continue to remind that person of the time line 
of completion that was arranged at the meeting. Then make sure that 
you hold him or her to the time line. 
 
 No, you’re not responsible if an employee doesn’t follow through. And 
no, it shouldn’t be your job to hover over all the meeting attendees who 
were assigned action items. But in terms of protecting the time you’ve 
invested in the project, it’s well worth a few minutes to shoot off a 
reminder or a quick status request by e-mail.
 
 To help you stay on track with the check-ins, keep the notes visible so 
you’re reminded of them throughout the day. Or add notes to your day-
planner to remind you to check on an employee’s status. For example, if 
one attendee was asked to send out an announcement in the company 
newsletter by Friday, list on your to-do notes to check in with the indi-
vidual on Wednesday.

T
he goal for any businessperson should be to set appointments with pros-
pects and clients. This is true whether your job is based in service or sales. 
You’re not in sales, you say? Believe it or not, you sell every day, no matter 
what your profession: You’re successful when others buy into your ideas. 
And as a salesperson, one of your key functions is to both qualify and conduct 
appointments with prospects, whether on the phone or face to face. When you 
qualify a person or an appointment, you’re determining the parameters and 
odds of doing business with this person or company, evaluating how much, 
how soon, and at what cost.
Achieving high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty is easier if you have 
regular appointments with your clients. Educating, training, and helping your 
clients book appointments with you shows them your commitment and caring 
for them. It makes them feel special and allows you to deal with problems and 
challenges before they become large and out of control. In most cases, these 
appointments center on solving problems.
In Chapter 8, I help you decide which communication medium is best for 
whatever situation you’re facing. In this chapter, I help you make the most 
of your appointments with business associates. These appointments require 
planning and careful listening because they’re two-way discussions that 
involve more than simply delivering information. Even if you don’t buy into 
the fact that you’re in sales, I guarantee that treating your decision-makers 
as customers will make it much easier to bring them around to your way of 
thinking.

220
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Determining Whether an Appointment 
Is Worth Your While
In any capacity where you’re trying to influence change through your powers 
of persuasion, the biggest factor you need to consider is the opportunity cost 
of that person’s input or business. When you invest time and effort into a pros-
pect who doesn’t buy, the opportunity cost is what you would have gained by 
investing your time in a prospect who would’ve responded favorably.
Having spent more than 20 years of my life in 100-percent commission sales with 
no salary base, company car, expense account, and so forth, I’m fanatical about 
knowing the opportunity cost of a prospect. When you get paid only for results, 
you do everything you can to zero in on the people most likely to offer a high 
return on your investment of time and energy. I assess associates in two ways:
 
 By the time investment they’ll require (that is, whether they’re high or 
low maintenance)
 
 In light of their probable return
High-maintenance personalities usually come with inflated egos and are diffi-
cult to satisfy. These personalities expect a lot, don’t give in, and keep charging 
forward until they get what they want. With low-maintenance personalities, on 
the other hand, the time you invest is usually minimal, and the individual’s sat-
isfaction level is higher than that of high-maintenance personalities.
 
The higher maintenance the customer is, the higher the return needs to be for 
an appointment to be worth your while. The best approach is to cut your losses 
and avoid investing in time-draining, high-maintenance, low-return opportuni-
ties. You experience far less frustration by investing in low-maintenance folks, 
and even when those low-maintenance associates give you a lower return, they 
enable you to have the energy and time to find low-maintenance opportunities 
that do yield high returns. My experience with low-maintenance, low-return 
personalities is that their appreciation of you grows over time. The constant 
value you provide increases their trust, which in turn increases the quantity of 
business they do with you, reducing the time you invest to get that business.
 
Obviously, the ideal associate is of the low-maintenance, high-return variety 
because these people let you trade small quantities of time for profitable busi-
ness opportunities. Unfortunately, these people don’t grow on trees. You have to 
work to earn their loyalty; after you earn it, make sure you hold onto them for life.
No matter what sort of business role you’re in, you have to evaluate the ratio 
of the time investment to the return of a business relationship. So how do 
you gauge the probable return, the likelihood that your appointment with 
someone will pay off? I use the DNA2 model, which evaluates four qualities: 
desire, need, ability, and authority.

221
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Desire
People do things for a reason. The reason, or desire, must be there at some 
level for you to even book an appointment. Does the other party want to 
enter into a strategic partnership or marketing alliance? Does this person 
have the desire to continue the service relationships after you solve the 
problem you’re meeting on?
If you take all the time you need to really pinpoint the desire, you may find it 
challenging to book an appointment because you questioned the person to 
death. At this point, you’re simply trying to gauge whether the desire is there 
at all.
 
One of the best ways to gauge desire in a prospect or business relationship is to 
ask for an appointment. The last place a sales prospect who lacks desire wants 
to be is in front of a salesperson pushing to meet quota. As soon as you have an 
indication that a face-to-face meeting would help move the relationship, sale, or 
business alliance along, go for the appointment.
 
The desire of a human being directly connects to time frame. The time frame 
to action is shorter when the person has a higher desire to meet, acquire your 
product or service, solve a problem between your two companies, or forge 
a new strategic alliance. The higher the desire, the higher — and quicker — 
your potential return.
Need
Before you book an appointment, making sure that the other person has a 
need is paramount. Is your colleague, strategic partner, or prospect experi-
encing a quantifiable void that you can help fill or bridge? In sales, the need 
is a specific and identifiable problem that your service can help a prospect 
overcome and resolve.
Spotting needs in most people as well as in most companies is relatively easy. 
Both people and companies usually know where some of their problems and 
challenges exist. However, they may not know the scope, size, or true source 
of those problems or challenges; they often focus on the symptoms rather 
than the disease. 
Essentially, what you’re assessing here is whether the client, prospect of 
strategic alliance, or partner is experiencing any sort of pain that points to 
an underlying need, whether he or she realizes what that need is. The greater 
the pain, the greater the need and urgency to alleviate the pain. Of course, 
you plan to be the one to relieve that pain with your product or service.

222
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Ability
The ability of a company or person is connected to financial capacity. 
Nothing is a bigger waste of time than to meet with someone who doesn’t 
have the money to act. Are dollars in the budget for what you’re proposing? 
If not, can the other person shift dollars from another area to this project? 
Would he be willing to? Ask the prospect, “If we can solve this issue, do you 
have room left in this years budget to make the investment?”
Can he request a budget increase in this area? When is his next budgetary 
cycle so you can potentially be in the budget for next year? Some people 
and companies leave more flexibility in their discretionary dollars; for others, 
it’s etched in stone. Try to gauge the other party’s flexibility and access to 
financial resources.
 
If you ask questions about money before you book an appointment, some 
people may feel you’re trying to screen them out or get at their soft underbelly, 
so try booking the appointment first. As soon as you have the appointment 
in hand, you’ve been granted permission to ask questions because they now 
assume you’re preparing for the appointment. If their responses aren’t right, 
graciously tell them that after further discussion, you’ve realized you won’t be 
able to help them and you don’t want to waste their valuable time by having 
them meet with you.
Authority
Authority is related to someone’s power to be the ultimate decision-maker. 
Does the buck stop here? Many people in business portray that position, but 
in reality, they don’t have the authority to change suppliers or vendors. They 
lack the power to alter specifications or delivery schedules. They can’t sign 
off on a strategic marketing alliance between your company and theirs.
If others will be involved in the final decisions, you want to include them in 
the appointment at the outset. By not including them, you guarantee at least 
another meeting. You may be creating an adversary rather than an ally. The 
decision-maker who’s left out feels slighted and blindsided and may lose 
status by not being part of the solution. She may try to bring in competition, 
making your task harder.
If not everyone can attend the appointment you’re trying to book, try to defer 
the appointment until later to allow all decision-makers to be present. When 
that’s not possible, you have to make a judgment call about whether to meet 
without everyone there or press the issue and risk turning off the person who 
feels she has the power but doesn’t.

223
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
 
Without all the decision-makers present, you’re relying on who you do meet 
with to convey your message well. If you’re in sales, this is an especially inef-
fective strategy. Rarely will anyone do a better job selling your position, views, 
and benefits in alignment with the size and cost of the problems more effec-
tively than you.
Preparing for the Appointment
Too often, people wing-and-a-prayer appointments, which can waste time 
and turn off the other attendees. The best insurance policy to having a pro-
ductive appointment is preparation. Determine the objectives, problems, 
discussion points, information, decision process, and framework for the 
appointment in advance. Ask questions about timing, problems and chal-
lenges, expectations, new opportunities, the current service level of your 
firm, and a host of other issues that are service and sales oriented. You’re 
really qualifying the appointment, determining the odds of a positive outcome 
if you invest your time in this appointment (in the preceding section, I show 
you how to qualify the prospect).
Identifying and qualifying the problem
In qualifying the problem at hand, you’re trying to determine the who, what, 
when, where, and why of how to continue an existing business relationship 
or forge a new business relationship. If you’re in sales or servicing, you ask 
these questions outright. If you’re preparing an unsolicited proposal, you ask 
yourself these questions and use the answers in the preparation and design 
of your presentation.
Asking questions is at the root of good customer service or good sales. In the 
following subsections, I discuss questions that help you explore the other 
party’s view of the problem, their time line, their experience with previous 
service providers, and your competition.
Understanding their understanding of the problem
Your presentation should clearly show what’s in it for the other party, so ask 
questions that help you understand their view of the problem — how it hap-
pened, what you can do, how they’d like to see it solved, and the like:
 
 “What is the problem or challenge currently? How do you feel about this 
problem?
 
 “How large is this problem? What do you think this problem is costing you?”

224
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 “When did you first discover this problem? How long have you had it? 
When did it begin to become significant?”
 
 “Where is the root cause of this issue? How did it happen from your view?”
 
 “Do you think we could help you with part of the problem? What part 
would that be? In an ideal situation, what would you like us to do?”
 
 “How do you think we should solve the problem? What have you tried in 
the past?”
 
 “Where do we go from this point? Where do you want us to be a month, 6 
months, or a year from now?”
Getting a feel for the time line
Knowing exactly when your associate wants a project done rather than as 
soon as possible can enable you to better manage your time and the results. 
The term ASAP has little value to anyone in the business world because it’s 
so open to interpretation. You can increase performance and decrease stress 
by throwing out the term ASAP and going to specific time frames, deadlines 
such as “before close of business tomorrow” or “by the end of the week” or 
“by noon today.”
A flexible time frame is often linked to lower motivation, lower desire, and 
less flexibility in the terms, conditions, and price parameters. You can use 
questions like these to ferret out a more precise time frame:
 
 “How soon do you need this?”
 
 “Can you tell me about the perfect time frame?”
 
 “If we couldn’t hit that deadline due to the work involved, is there another 
time that’d be acceptable?”
 
 “When will you make a decision?”
Inquiring about past experiences
The past filters into future decision-making. The experiences the other 
person has had with your company, and with companies like yours, will be 
factored into the equation. To maximize the results and minimize the time 
you invest, you need to understand those previous experiences. If you’ll be 
making some type of sales, product, or service presentation at the appoint-
ment, the knowledge about past experiences does the following:
 
 Influences what you emphasize in the presentation
 
 Affects how you structure the presentation
 
 Influences the reassurances you offer during the presentation
 
 Offers a glimpse of the sale objections you may encounter in selling to 
this prospect

225
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Here are some effective questions about past experiences:
 
 “Could you tell me about how you like to work with service providers?”
 
 “Have you ever had a time when a supplier or strategic partner didn’t meet 
your needs? What happened? Can you give me a little more detail of that 
situation?”
 
 “What’s your typical process for a decision like this?”
Finding out what you’re up against
Most of the time in the business world, you’re in competition. You’re competing 
not only for new relationships but also to keep the relationships you have now. 
Thinking that your competitors aren’t trying to secure your current accounts — 
or that your competitors could never get those clients away from you — is naïve.
Before an important business appointment, you need to know the competi-
tion, who else the decision-makers are considering, or what other options 
they’re considering. They may be considering putting in-house resources 
into the problem, so you may be competing against an internal department in 
the company rather then an external competitor. Questions such as the ones 
here can help you understand your competition:
 
 “Who else are you considering for this task?”
 
 “Do you intend to outsource this problem?”
 
 “How did you select X as a possible solution source?”
 
 “Are you looking at any options besides Y?”
Determining the objectives 
for the appointment
The real goals of any appointment are to create decisions, action items, and 
progressive movement toward a predetermined objective. To accomplish 
that, you need to know clearly what the goals, targets, and objectives of 
the appointment are — for both you and the other party. You need to know 
whether a decision will be made in the course of the appointment and what 
details need to be understood and conveyed to lead to that decision.
 
The determining-objectives segment of qualifying the meeting is so impor-
tant. Don’t rush. Too many professionals at this stage take the same standard 
answers — “we just want the job done” or “we just want the problem solved” or 
“we just want more widgets sold.” The challenge with these obvious responses 
is that you haven’t really gained anything of value. You don’t have any insight 
into how others are thinking, what’s important to them, or how they may 
decide. And that’s a problem because they’ll judge your service, solution, or 
product by how it resolves the unseen or unknown additional issues.

226
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Here are some questions to help you clarify the other party’s objectives:
 
 “How will you gauge success in this project?”
 
 “What do you specifically want from us in service?”
 
 “What are the top three things you would like us to provide for you?”
 
 “How will you evaluate a successful long-term relationship between us?”
 
 “Is there anything else that I’ve missed that factors into your final decision?”
For many of these questions, you’ll likely receive the obvious reflex response. 
To avoid wasting your time, employ the besides-that technique of probing: 
 
 “Besides that, what else are you hoping to accomplish?”
 
 “Besides that, is there anything else you want?”
 
 “Besides that, what else would you ideally like for “this” to do?”
 
 “Besides the X problem, is there any other problem we need a solution for?”
Of course, your objectives matter as well because they guide your approach 
to the meeting. For instance, if the goal of the meeting is to gather and 
evaluate information, you want to set the meeting’s agenda to gather more 
information and to confirm the qualifying you’ve done thus far. You want to 
pinpoint terms, conditions, specifications, expectations, a time line, and the 
competition. You want to get to know the decision-maker so you can better 
tailor the final-decision presentation that comes later.
On the other hand, the meeting geared toward getting someone to make a 
final decision focuses on the potential road blocks and challenges (and even 
solves objections if it’s a sales presentation). You want to know who’ll be 
attending the meeting. You have to make sure the key people who really do 
make the decision are present. You also want to evaluate the landscape of 
people. Who are your internal advocates? Who will present the biggest 
challenge to convince?
Creating an agenda
Planning for the eventual outcome or planning out the pathway to the out-
come is really scripting the results. Most professionals use some form of 
scripting so they can more easily replicate their successes. Attorneys use 
legal briefs to script out their arguments, evidence, and questions for each 
witness, both for the plaintiff and the complainant. They anticipate what will 
happen before entering the courtroom. They never ask a question that they 
don’t already know the answer to. Similarly, a pilot follows a checklist before 
taking off and landing — that’s also a script. (If your pilot lacks the checklist, 
get off the plane!)

227
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Creating an agenda for the meeting is essentially one way to script out a 
meeting. The agenda allows you to proceed to the objective of the meeting 
in the most direct path with the least distractions. By devising a script or 
checklist for an appointment, you can consider the problems or roadblocks 
you may encounter and craft responses in advance. You anticipate questions 
that’ll be raised and figure out your responses.
Create an agenda that follows a logical path of
 
 Reconfirming what you discovered in advance of the meeting
 
 Opening up to other discussion points and problems so you clearly 
understand the issues
 
 Guiding the other party to your solutions and why they should accept them
 
 Offering any guarantees for their satisfaction
 
 Asking them to commit to action now or with in a specific time frame
 
I personally like the final agenda item to indicate that a decision will be made 
at the meeting. By having the final item be “making the decision to move for-
ward” or “completing the paperwork” or whatever phrase you want to use, 
you set the stage. You’re basically foreshadowing that the other party will 
have enough information to take action. It’s clear and concise in the agenda, 
so they can’t miss it. And if they say they won’t be making a decision today, at 
least you know and can ask why. The agenda item is also there so you don’t 
wimp out in moving a decision forward.
You want to hand the agenda out and ask for approval to operate in this 
manner. For example, you may say 
 
 “I’ve prepared an agenda for this appointment. Would it be all right if we 
use it to guide us?”
 
 “Is there anything that I might’ve missed that’s a concern of yours?”
 
 “So this format is agreeable to you?”
The truth is that 99 times out of 100, they’re almost so stunned at your 
preparedness and professionalism they don’t know what to say but yes!
Beginning the Appointment 
on Solid Ground
Too many people are late in the business world without understanding the 
ramifications. For some customers, your being late smacks of saying, “My 
time is more important than yours.” That may not be your intention, but 
that’s the message some people receive from you.

228
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
Don’t be late! Leave enough of a margin for travel time, traffic delays, forgot-
ten items, or any other curveball of life. My view toward people who are tardy 
is not positive. If you’re late to a meeting with me, the likelihood that we’ll 
engage in business has dropped dramatically. I know of many CEOs of compa-
nies who feel the same way because of the value they place on their time. The 
higher you go in the organizational structure of a company, the more you’ll 
encounter that view. These people are at the top of the organizational chart 
because of their time management and business skills.
 
If you’re going to be late even by one minute, call ahead. The professional and 
courteous person informs his appointment of his delay so she can invest her 
time in something other than waiting. If you’re doing a lunch appointment, call 
the restaurant and have the host or hostess inform your appointment of your 
delay.
Of course, showing up on time (and keeping the small talk to a reasonable 
level) is only the first step. In this section, I explain how to get your appoint-
ment off to a great start.
What to do if you’re early
If you’re operating on the premise that you’ll 
never be late, then you’ll probably be early by 
ten minutes or so most of the time. Here are 
some things that you can do with that time:
  Observe: Take a few minutes to observe 
the pictures, periodicals, and parapherna-
lia in your appointment’s office. What does 
the person read or subscribe to? Are there 
pictures that obviously reflect your appoint-
ment’s hobbies or interests? Is the furniture 
and décor more utilitarian or showy?
  Engage: Strike up a quick conversation 
with the frontline staff, such as the recep-
tionist. Don’t monopolize her time and be 
a nuisance. Be pleasant and respectful of 
her and her workload. You want to connect 
with her so when you call on the phone, 
you’ll be put through rather than screened 
out. Building a personal connection with the 
gatekeeper is always a wise use of time.
  Review: Review your agenda, qualifying 
questions, and responses. Review what 
you’re going to say. Giving your notes a 
final once-over never hurts. You can never 
be too prepared for an appointment.
  Read: You should always carry something 
of value to read, whether it’s a trade jour-
nal, self-improvement book title, or your 
tear file (a collection of articles you’ve torn 
from magazines or journals to read later). 
Time is too valuable not to invest in some-
thing, even in the waiting room.

229
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Confirming the objectives
The first agenda item I recommend is reconfirming the answers to the qualify-
ing questions (see the earlier section “Preparing for the Appointment”). You 
want to ensure you recorded all the other party’s responses correctly and 
make sure that nothing has changed. You also want to further impress them 
that you took the care not only to listen but also to record their responses.
 
If you’ve gotten all the decision-makers to the appointment, recognize that in 
most cases, you qualified only one of them. You have no idea whether the goals, 
objectives, expectations, and past experiences are the same as those of the 
person you actually talked with before the appointment. To build your cred-
ibility and increase their trust level of you and your firm, ask for input from the 
other decision-makers as you confirm the answers. Having these answers allows 
you to further approach the other party’s needs, wants, and desires.
 
The more you focus on them at this stage, the more effective the meeting will 
be. Most people are permanently tuned to radio station WIIFM: What’s in it for 
me? To persuade others, you have to tune your meetings and presentations to 
their frequency of WIIFM.
Presenting your ideas
After you confirm the answers to the qualifying questions and further uncover 
needs, wants, desires, and expectations, you’re ready to transition to the sec-
tion of the appointment I call Why Do Business with Me? or Why My Solutions? 
Here’s where you’re really making your presentation. At this point, you’ve built 
enough understanding and trust that you can focus on building value for your 
solutions, products, services, or anything else you’re advocating.
Linking your recommendation to the other party’s goals
Ford Motor Company won big with its Mustang, Explorer, and Taurus. Boeing 
still dominates the air with its 737 and 747, both introduced in the 1960s. 
Microsoft blew away the competition when it introduced Windows in the 
mid-1980s. Big wins don’t come along every day (Ford also produced the 
Edsel, a huge flop in the late 1950s that cost the company $350 million), but 
they’re every company’s top goal. 
 
If you want to speed decision-making, help people connect your proposal to 
big wins: their company’s and their own. In fact, even smaller wins, such as 
significant savings, better-informed executives, and happier employees, are 
keys to success, both yours and other people’s. Begin by helping people 
answer these questions:

230
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 “What’s in it for me?” 
 
 “How will this make me look good?”
 
 “What’s the primary benefit if I act now?”
 
 “What other advantages do I accrue by acting sooner rather than later?”
 
 “How does this benefit my department?” 
 
 “How does this help my company?”
Helping decision-makers answer these questions allows you to sit, if only for 
a short time, behind the other person’s desk. When you approach problems 
from that perspective, you align your goals with theirs and you both win big.
Detailing the value of your proposed solution
After you link your offering with your decision-makers’ goals, press on. Make 
sure your decision-makers see all the advantages of going with your idea — 
and be specific. “It’s really good!” or “It’s better than what you have now” 
or “I promise you’ll like it” — these statements might as well be in a foreign 
language for all the information they convey. Specifics draw pictures; they 
convince. For example, if you’re trying to sell your company’s product to a 
client, work with your decision-maker to discover detailed benefits in
 
 Price
 
 Terms over the competition
 
 More streamlined systems
 
 Faster turnarounds
 
 Better, more reliable information that’s available more quickly
 
 Better customer relations 
 
 Security and peace of mind
Show how buying your brand of running shoes, agreeing with your proposal 
for the company picnic, or selecting the paper vendor you recommend 
advances corporate goals and delivers specific advantages to everyone 
involved, and decisions will drop like ripe fruit into your lap.
 
In this fast-moving, high-tech world, today’s up-to-the-minute information is 
tomorrow’s old news. Those who make rapid decisions often end up with 
trophies, it’s true, but the quality of decisions made is at least as important 
as how quickly they’re made. Do your homework and deal honestly and 
effectively with hurdles and objections, and you’ll win every time. Persuading 
others to give up the right decision for a quick decision damages your relation-
ships and your credibility.

231
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Gauging your progress
As you present your solution, you periodically want to test how you’re doing. 
Are you on the right track to success with the other party? Have you made the 
right conclusions about their needs and problems, and do your solutions or 
proposed changes meet and exceed those needs? You also want to confirm 
that you haven’t missed anything thus far.
These progress checks can be as simple as “Does this make sense?” “Am I 
heading in the right direction?” or “Can you see anything I’ve missed?” You 
may even offer to open things up to questions and answers at the end.
Tailoring the Presentation to Your 
Client’s Decision-Making Style
For more than ten years, I’ve been teaching and coaching behavioral strategies 
based on four styles of the DISC program — Dominant, Influencer, Steady, and 
Compliant (to find out more about your style and that of others, see Chapter 
13) During your appointment, you can rein in your expectations and bypass a 
lot of frustration if you recognize upfront what type of decision-maker you’re 
dealing with. Different decision-making styles require varying amounts and 
Making the sale to a discriminating 3-year-old
Selling ideas at home is sometimes as chal-
lenging as anything you face at the office. Joan 
and I, for example, were recently in the final 
stages of closing the sale of big-girl panties to 
our 3-year-old daughter, Annabelle. Annabelle 
will be the final arbiter of when that fateful day 
comes, but that doesn’t stop Joan and me from 
constantly reminding Annabelle of the value, 
benefit, and comfort of wearing big-girl pant-
ies. Here’s how we do it:
  “In big-girl panties, you’ll always be clean 
and dry. Won’t that be nice?”
  “When you wear big-girl panties, you’ll be 
able to run faster after Wesley [her older 
brother].”
  “Next year, you’ll wear big-girl panties, just 
like the other kids at preschool.”
Laugh if you like, but these benefits and values, 
described in glowing details, are important to 
our small customer. (Notice we state our ben-
efits in positive rather than negative terms: We 
help Annabelle envision her future glory; we 
don’t tell her she won’t be wearing diapers, 
won’t be soggy and messy, and so on). The same 
is true of all customers: Decision-making accel-
erates if you continue to impress them with the 
numerous advantages of your proposal.

232
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
types of information, which in turn dictate how quickly people make deci-
sions. For instance, the decision cycle tends to be shorter for Dominants and 
Influencers. Dominants base decisions on gut feelings and convictions, and 
Influencers base decisions on feelings. Neither Dominants nor Influencers 
need as many facts, figures, and details as Steadies and Compliants do.
A good way to identify someone’s behavioral style is to know what kinds of 
questions each type is likely to ask. In this section, I include some sample 
questions for each personality type. (Note that I provide more sample ques-
tions for Steadies and Compliants than I do for Influencers and Dominants. 
That’s because Steadies and Compliants typically ask more questions.) I 
also explain how you can tweak your presentation so you best appeal to 
each personality type.
 
Keep in mind that people can exhibit overlapping characteristics of two or 
even three different styles.
Getting to the point with Dominants
Questions that Dominants deliver are direct, forceful, and sometimes designed 
to intimidate. If you waffle, give up control, or hesitate too long, they won’t 
respect you and you won’t get the decision you’re looking for. Dominants ask
 
 “Who else have you told this to?”
 
 “What’s my bottom line result, advantage, or cost?”
 
 “What makes you sure this is right for us?”
Two different styles, two different approaches
I’ll never forget my first management job. 
Although I had five people reporting to me, two 
stand out in my memory: Lee and Tim.
When I delegated a project to Lee, she obligingly 
took notes and went off to work. She might come 
back to me numerous times during the project 
with questions she hadn’t previously thought of 
or with anecdotes about how the work was pro-
ceeding. She tended to check back frequently 
during the project to make sure she was on the 
right track, and she quickly made adjustments if 
she wasn’t. Lee was flexible, communicative, a 
fast worker, and an excellent employee.
On the other hand, when approaching Tim, I 
learned to dole out information in small pieces 
and give him time to get used to new ideas. If 
I barraged him with information and expected 
him to trot off and begin working, as Lee did, it 
didn’t happen. If, however, I gave him time to 
absorb the information, ask questions upfront, 
work on another project for a day or two, and 
return to the new project I’d assigned, Tim 
came through for me every time — as long as I 
gave him time. And he often came up with more-
innovative solutions than Lee did. Tim was also 
an excellent employee.

Dominants test your self-confidence and conclusions. If you don’t demonstrate 
overwhelming belief and conviction, they refuse to move forward. To steer the 
Dominant toward the decision you seek, keep these tips in mind:
 
 Be brief, be bright, be gone.
 
 Don’t waste time with testimonials.
 
  Use a direct business approach.
 
 Get to the point quickly and solve the problem.
Dazzling the trendsetting Influencer
Influencers typically deliver questions with warmth and even playfulness. 
They ask questions to uncover your emotions and determine relationships. 
That’s how they make decisions. Here are some typical Influencer questions:
 
 “Why do you feel we should do this?”
 
 “How much newer is this latest technology?
 
 “How many others have it?”
 
 “Can you lower your price a little?”
Influencers see themselves as trendsetting and cutting-edge. They tend to 
make flashy, fast, and sometimes even reckless decisions. An Influencer waits 
in line all day for the release of the latest telecommunications gadget so he or 
she can be one of the first to own one.
 
To appeal to an Influencer, follow these recommendations:
 
 Allow time to warm up and socialize.
 
 Focus, make it fun, and use stories.
 
 Hit the high points; don’t be too detailed.
 
 Present showy new services, ideas, and products with sizzle.
Reassuring the Steady
A Steady’s questioning is typically nonconfrontational, service-oriented, and 
information-seeking. Steadies look for a high level of security before they’re 
willing to make decisions, even those involving small changes. Examples of 
Steady questions include the following:

234
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 “Have there been times this didn’t work? Tell me about those.”
 
 “I receive good service. Why should I change?”
 
 “How long have you been in business?”
 
 “What happens if this doesn’t work?”
 
 “Can you call me in a week? I want to think it over.”
 
Steadies want to be certain that if they proceed, they won’t be surprised by 
problems or negative outcomes. They tend to put off decisions as long as 
possible. Here’s how to help expedite the process:
 
 Win the decision with a deliberate approach.
 
 Use plenty of proof and statistics to make your point.
 
 Earn trust and friendship first; talk about family and hobbies.
 
 Answer all questions and confirm their agreement with your responses.
 
Be careful with Steadies; they’d rather say maybe until hell freezes over than 
have to face you with a no. They can waste a lot of time because they know 
how to appear interested when they really aren’t. And if they aren’t interested, 
they privately hope you won’t call back — ever. (For more info on maybes, see 
the later section “Handling Indecision.”)
Providing facts and figures 
for the Compliant
A Compliant’s typical questioning process is just that: a process. Compliants 
do nothing without an organized plan. They want all the facts, figures, data, 
and studies you can give them, and then they evaluate the data by pound of 
paper. For Compliants, a 99-percent probability of success is, in many cases, 
too low. Examples of Compliant questions include the following:
 
 “What warranty do you offer?”
 
 “What are your qualifications?”
 
 “How long has this product been out?”
 
 “What’s the return or refund rate on it?”
 
 “What other facts can you share with me?”
 
Here’s how to move a Compliant closer to a decision:

235
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
 
 Provide time to absorb details and facts before you expect the next step.
 
 Use other Compliants’ and Steadies’ testimonials.
 
 Go slowly and avoid small talk; get to the point with truckloads of support 
data in hand.
 
 Suggest only established or tried-and-true solutions; Compliants are 
suspicious of anything new or unproven.
Handling Indecision
Time lost in meetings is consolidated and obvious — everyone yawns through 
those minutes and hours together. But think how many decisions — from 
which shirt to wear to work to which pajamas to wear to bed — people 
make daily. Time spent dawdling about any decision, big or small, adds up. 
Additionally, the longer a decision takes, the greater the probability of a no. As 
eminent Harvard theologian Harvey Cox put it, “Not to decide is to decide.”
The good news is that no matter how many closed-end questions you ask, 
there are only three possible answers: yes, no, and maybe. If you can bring 
your decision-maker to the crossroads of yes/no/maybe, he or she has to 
choose, usually sooner rather than later. The biggest time waster at this 
stage is taking too long to get to the crossroads.
Yes-and-no answers are typically easy to recognize, and the appropriate 
response is more straightforward. But then you face the biggest, blackest hole 
of wasted time ever: the dreaded maybe. The Maybe Zone, like the Bermuda 
Triangle, is an awful place: You’re alone, fogged in, and disconnected. Your 
dials and gauges go blank, and time and space — not to mention progress — 
stand still.
In this section, I explain how to understand the reason for that indecision, 
ask questions to break through the Maybe Zone barriers, and build your 
case. I also explain a few alternate sources of rescue — getting past choke 
points and turning to other decision-makers.
Assessing the reason behind a “maybe”
I’m guilty of drifting into the Maybe Zone myself. I say maybe when I’m tired, I’m 
not ready to deal with the issue, or I don’t feel like a battle. Or I hope that 
ignoring the question will make it go away (fat chance). Eventually, I have to 
respond. 

236
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
When faced with a maybe, your best response is to determine whether you’ve 
thoroughly researched your decision-maker’s
 
 Motivation
 
 Need
 
 Authority
 
 Ability
 
 Time line
 
 Possible obstacles
 
 Possible stalls
Make sure you’ve covered these bases. If you have and you’re still stuck, try to 
figure out whether your decision-maker is saying maybe because he or she is
 
 Reluctant to disappoint you and hoping you forget
 
 Too tired to make a decision right now
 
 Missing information
 
 Needing a third party’s counsel or approval before making the final decision
The reason for the maybe lets you know what you’re up against. It helps you 
identify when the maybe is a really a veiled no because the other party is too 
tired or too nice to tell you the truth. If you let maybes go unchallenged, deci-
sion time stretches on, and the odds of a resounding yes! diminish with each 
passing day.
Asking questions
Opened-ended questions are king in terms of moving past a maybe. They 
functionally pass the baton, or dialogue, to the other person. They require 
thoughtful and more-detailed responses than a simple yes or no. As the asker, 
you guide and maintain control of the conversation, discovering a wealth of 
information because you’re listening rather than speaking.
Here are some questions to help boost you out of the Maybe Zone:
 
 “How do you typically make these types of decisions?”
 
 “Tell me about your decision-making process. What information do you 
need, and when do you need it?”
 
 “Who else is part of the final decision?”
 
 “Is this a change you believe you have to or would like to make?”

237
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
 
 “Is there anything you can see now that may delay your decision?”
 
 “Under what circumstance would you consider agreeing to my proposal?”
 
 “Do you ever see yourself using a service such as ours?”
 
 “Are there conditions that we could include that would allow us to move 
ahead? What would those circumstances, services, guarantees, or 
conditions be?”
If your time in the Maybe Zone expands, or worse, begins transforming itself 
into a No Zone, call on another line of defense: the invaluable and underrated 
why. The question word why is a longtime friend of mine. With its help, I’ve 
broken through barriers I thought were insurmountable. See what happens 
when you ask the following:
 
 “Why do you feel the way you do about my proposal?”
 
 “Why do you believe you need to wait?”
 
 “Why are you more comfortable making this decision next week?”
 
 “Why do you need to get Joe’s opinion on this?”
 
 “Why do you feel you need to think it over?”
 
One winter, we were in Palm Desert for a family vacation. Wesley, at 5, 
decided to open a lemonade stand in front of the golf course. We went to the 
store and bought lemonade, cookies, paper cups, construction paper, and 
felt-tip pens to make a sign. As soon as Wesley’s lemonade stand opened, I 
could barely get him to wait until the golfers putted before he went down to 
the green to make his sale presentation for lemonade. He walked up to the 
first group and asked them if they wanted lemonade. I heard them say no and 
thought, “I hope he doesn’t get discouraged.” But I heard Wesley say, “Why? 
It’s really good lemonade. It’s refreshing, and I made it myself.” These adults 
were no match for Wesley and his why. They were the first of many people 
to buy from him. He sold more than $22 worth of lemonade and would have 
sold more if he hadn’t run out. You can learn a lot from a 5-year-old who isn’t 
scared to ask why.
Outlining pros and cons
Countless how-to books advise readers to list pros and cons when making 
decisions. If your client is drifting in the decision-making doldrums — that 
dreaded Maybe Zone — encourage him or her to make a written for-and-
against-list. This technique works best in person, but you can do it over the 
phone if necessary. (You can also make a list yourself and share it with the 
decision-maker, but it’s better if that person comes up with the list because 
then he or she owns the ideas.)

238
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
If you’re fortunate enough to meet with your decision-maker in person, ask 
him or her to make two columns on the paper and write For or Positive at 
the top of the left column and Against or Negative at the top of the right 
column. Suggest that your decision-maker start with the Positive column. 
Let him or her begin working alone. Usually, people start strong and then 
lose steam. It’s okay to ask, “What about X? Do you see that as a positive?” 
Pose your advantage as a question so it becomes your decision-maker’s 
idea. Provide encouragement as the list lengthens. Aim for a Positive list of 
at least 15 to 20 items. 
Then shift to the Negative side. Here you are mute. Your job is to sit quietly 
and let the other person struggle to fill the page. If your proposal is valid, 
your decision-maker should sweat to come up with a list of negatives. When 
the exercise is finished, the two sides should be starkly different. Ideally, 
your pros list is packed with excellent reasons to act and act now.
Building urgency by addressing 
the decision-maker’s time line
A frequent cause of delays in decision-making is undefined time lines and 
expectations. A common stall tactic is “send me more information.” (You’ve 
just sent more than 200 pages of documentation — who could need more?) 
To find out more and help prompt a decision, ask the following:
 
 “How much more information do you need?” (Try not to sound incredulous 
when you say this!)
 
 “What specifically do you need? Is there anything in addition to this material 
that you’ll need to make a decision?”
 
 “Does anyone else need this information?”
 
 “Provided I get all this to you by X date, when do you think you might 
arrive at a decision?”
 
 “What issues do you feel this additional information will help you resolve?”
 
 “Would you like to discuss your concerns directly with me?”
 
 “Should we set another time to talk one week from now?”
These questions help you figure out the following:
 
 What, exactly, your customer needs
 
 What that person plans to do with the information and when he or she 
plans to do it
 
 How soon you can expect action after providing it

239
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
Shrinking perceived risks
Of course, it’s always possible that you’ve screeched to a halt because your 
decision-maker has valid questions and concerns. Wouldn’t it be wonderful 
if you could clear away these stumbling blocks? You can — by addressing 
the risks the decision-maker is wary of, and then dismantling them. The step-
by-step process outlined here dramatically raises the odds of moving your 
decision-maker to a choice, whether hesitation stems from logic or caution:
 
1. Identify concrete concerns and determine how important they are. 
 
 If someone’s unsure, he or she tends to blow up risks to mythical pro-
portions, and the longer you let the risk rattle around in someone’s 
brain, the less likely it is that the decision will end up in your favor. Ask 
the following:
 
• “What’s the biggest concern you have with my recommendation? 
What do you believe the odds of that happening are?”
 
• “What downsides do you see, now and in the future?”
 
2. Quantify the risks.
 
 Deal with risks in a straightforward fashion. Help the decision-maker 
whittle them down to a level he or she can tolerate. As when detailing 
benefits, specific numbers and percentages go further than generalities 
such as big, small, quite a lot, too much, and the like. Ask questions such 
as these:
 
• “On a scale of one to ten, what amount of risk is acceptable?”
 
• “If you had to give me a percentage, what percentage of risk can you 
tolerate?”
 
 When someone says, “That’s too much risk,” you may have to pluck 
numbers out of your head to prime the pump: Is a 30-percent chance of 
failure too great? Yes? How about a 10-percent chance? 
 
3. After laying the groundwork, ask about solutions.
 
 Try some of these questions:
 
• “What can we change or adjust to bring the risk down to the 10-percent 
level that’s acceptable to you?”
 
• “Are others offering something that makes you feel working with us 
may entail more risk than working with them?”
 
• “Is there something you need that we haven’t offered? Something that 
reduces your feeling of risk and increases your comfort?”
 
4. Make others comfortable with your proposal and assure them they 
can achieve the results they want.
 
 Decisions come fast and furious if risks seem manageable and acceptable 
for those making up their minds.

240
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
As you persuade people to make up their minds, remember that some 
decision-makers hesitate because they’re afraid to make mistakes. If you aim 
to get customers, colleagues, bosses, employees, and even your children to 
make good decisions in reasonable time, be aware of — and address, whether 
directly or more subtly — the fear that makes them hesitate.
Making last-ditch efforts to 
get out of the Maybe Zone
 
You say you’ve done everything in the preceding sections, and your decision-
maker still hasn’t budged from the Maybe Zone? Be bold! It never hurts to give 
it one more shot before giving up. Here are some good tactics:
 
 Revisit your qualifying questions. Re-evaluate the other person’s 
authority to act, and ask whether the person’s budget has become an 
issue. Has the budget changed since you began the process? Has some-
one with greater authority frozen spending from the cost center that 
would pay for your purchase? (See the earlier section “Determining 
Whether an Appointment Is Worth Your While” for more on qualifying 
prospects.)
 
 Allow the decision-maker to review the numbers or consult with some-
one else. Even the company president may need the board of directors’ 
approval before acting. Outside business, if the decision is significant, 
one spouse often defers a decision until he or she can talk with the other 
spouse. Ask decision-makers whether they need to consult anything or 
anyone else.
 
 Enlist the help of internal advocates. If a stalemate draws on (and 
on), step back. Who in the corporation wants the job done and done 
now? Someone stands to gain some benefit — whether it’s recognition, 
income, prestige, or advancement — by moving forward. These people 
are your internal advocates. You may never have met them, and they 
may not be directly involved in the decision-making. In fact, they proba-
bly aren’t involved, or the decision would’ve already been made. If that’s 
the case, draw these folks into the loop so they can champion your 
solution from inside. Advise them of the progress (or lack of progress) 
you’re making and ask for their help. Once again, align your interests 
with theirs so you’re pulling together.
 
 Ferret out the choke point. A decision may slow or stall because there’s 
a designated blocker, also known as a choke point. My company, Sales 
Champions, has a designated blocker. We send people to this person to 
vet all issues and problems, and our designated blocker deliberately, 
cautiously, and painstakingly evaluates all details before presenting 
recommendations to the senior management team.

241
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
 
 Moving beyond the choke point is easier and faster if you win over the 
blocker. Get to know this person and define his or her needs, power, 
influence, and decision style (see the earlier section “Tailoring the 
Presentation to Your Client’s Decision-Making Style”); then deal with 
the blocker as you would with any other decision-maker. If you find the 
blocker doesn’t have real power, go around him or her to your internal 
advocates or to someone who has the power to make the decision.
Knowing when to give up
I often tell my salespeople that if a decision-maker implies repeatedly that 
he or she wants to make a decision and then does nothing after a handful of 
inquiries to move forward, continued efforts to convince that person can be 
like watering a dead plant: Although the activity my make you feel busy, you 
won’t revive the plant.
It’s a long journey from the impasse of mild interest or indifference to the 
desire and need of someone who’s ready to decide. Chances are, if your 
decision-maker is tiptoeing around an answer, he or she has already made 
a decision: the decision to wait. Here are questions to help you assess your 
investment of time:
 
 On a scale of 1 to 10, what are the odds this person will move forward now?
 
 On a scale of 1 to 10, what are the odds this person will ever move forward?
 
 How much time must you invest to dramatically improve those odds?
For those in sales, a fourth question may be whether you really want this cus-
tomer now and for the long run. Obviously, if you’re trying to sell an idea to 
your boss or spouse, jettisoning the relationship isn’t an option. But in other 
cases, weigh the time you’re putting in and examine what you’re gaining; in 
business parlance, analyze the return on your investment.
Addressing Straggling Concerns 
and Inviting Action
In all appointments comes a moment in which you want to create agreement 
or action items. You want total buy-in to move forward with the whole recom-
mendation (or some of it if you can’t gain it all). At some point in the meeting, 
you have to ask for what you want to have happen next. At this point, some-
one needs to
 
 Make a definitive statement concerning what he or she believes needs to 
happen in the next steps

242
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 Ask others to participate
If you’re trying to get a company to participate in a charity fundraiser, some-
one has to list the benefits to the charity, the company, and the employees 
and say, “Let’s go do it.” In a sales presentation, you need to make a definitive 
statement about the value of your products and services and ask the prospect 
to do business with you.
In the end, if you don’t ask, you don’t get. There’s no receiving without 
asking. In this section, I explain how to address decision-makers’ straggling 
concerns, present a solution, and invite everyone to take action.
Step 1: Pause
After your decision-maker has raised an argument or concern, pause. A pause 
works magic and invests the pauser (that’s you) with control of the conversa-
tion. It forces your decision-maker to think (and it may even cause the tem-
perature in the room to go up a few degrees).
If you pause, you avoid seeming defensive by jumping to answer the decision-
maker’s concerns before he or she has finished voicing them. A pause lets 
you hear what your decision-maker is saying and lets him or her finish the 
thought. It also gives you a moment to collect your thoughts. If you’re trying 
to formulate a response while your prospect is speaking, you may miss out 
on your decision-maker’s real issues. Pauses also prevent you from interrupt-
ing the other person when he or she is expressing concerns, which can make 
you seem hurried or, worse, uncaring and inconsiderate.
Step 2: Acknowledge
After you pause, acknowledge your decision-maker’s concern. Even if 
the concern seems ridiculous to you, acknowledge that the decision-
maker’s view carries weight, that you heard it, and that you understand. 
Acknowledging also buys you additional time to solve problems.
 
Acknowledgement is not the same as agreement. You needn’t agree with your 
decision-maker’s concern; you merely need to recognize that it’s valid to him 
or her. To bridge the gap between you and your decision-maker, you have 
three options:
 
 You can change your thinking to agree with your decision-maker’s.
 
 You can tactfully convince your decision-maker that your approach 
accomplishes the desired results more effectively.
 
 You and your decision-maker can meet somewhere in the middle.

243
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
You can even thank your decision-maker without agreeing. Here are some 
effective statements for neutral acknowledgment:
 
 “I can see why that might be a concern.”
 
 “That’s a terrific question. I’m glad you asked it.”
 
 “Thank you for bringing that up. I want to be sure to address that for you.”
 
 “I understand your concern.”
Another effective technique is to link a probing question to the end of your 
acknowledgment. It increases your decision-maker’s trust in you and shows 
that you care how he or she feels. Here are some of my favorites:
 
 “I understand your concern in this area. Tell me, why do you feel that way?”
 
 “I see where that might cause concern. Can you tell me more, please?”
 
 “I appreciate your hesitation. Have you had a previous bad experience with A?”
An acknowledgment followed by a probing question provides a bridge to the 
next step in the process: exploration.
 
When acknowledging, avoid the word but. But negates every word that follows 
it and makes you appear defensive. What’s more, it casts a negative pall over 
the entire statement. Sometimes and makes a good substitute. Listen to the 
difference:
 
 “You did a great job, but you made a few mistakes.” (Compare: “You did a 
great job, and I know you’ll be able to correct these few mistakes in no time.”)
 
 “I understand why you want a snake, but your mother won’t like it.” 
(Compare: “I understand why you want a snake. Have you thought about 
what your mother will say?”)
Step 3: Explore
Exploring (another word for probing) clarifies your decision-maker’s concern. 
What’s causing the concern? Did a previous supplier drop the ball? Does 
the decision-maker distrust you and your company? Has he or she heard a 
horror story from a friend or colleague?
If you explore well, you gain a better understanding of the size, intensity, 
and emotional context of your decision-maker’s concern. Here are some 
exploration questions:
 
 “Can we talk about your views on this in depth?”
 
 “What is the primary influence that is causing you to view my proposal 
this way?”

244
Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
 
 “Is there a reason you feel I’m not qualified to be considered for this 
promotion?”
Step 4: Isolate
Your goal is to move beyond the smoke and mirrors and get to the real 
problem. You can’t help someone make the right decision unless you know 
everything that’s blocking the decision. Using scripts to isolate reasons for 
concern dramatically increases persuasiveness. Here are some questions 
that help you pin down the problem:
 
 “Suppose we could find a satisfactory solution to this concern of yours. 
Would you give me the go-ahead?”
 
 “Is this the only reason holding you back from finalizing this decision?”
 
 “Other than X, is there any other reason you can think of that would cause 
you not to move forward?”
 
 “If this problem didn’t exist, would you be ready to proceed right now?”
These techniques get the decision-maker to consider your proposal from a 
what-if standpoint. What would your decision-maker do if you had the power 
to solve the problem right now?
Sometimes you may isolate the cause for hesitation only to discover that you 
can’t meet your decision-maker’s demands in terms of price, service, deliv-
ery, and so on. Nonetheless, the insight you gain allows you to cement your 
relationship with the decision-maker and possibly develop a chance to serve 
him or her in the future.
Step 5: Answer
After you isolate the exact problem or problems, you move to the answer 
stage. As you offer your answer, strive for conviction, strong belief in your 
view, and real solutions; instill confidence that you can help your decision-
maker achieve his or her objectives. Make your delivery enthusiastic. If 
you’re not excited about these terrific opportunities, how can you expect 
your decision-maker to be?
Here are some examples of answers that acknowledge the decision-maker’s 
concerns and offer a solution that addresses those issues:
 
 “Although I understand your concern about my experience, I’m not new to 
serving customers. I had a 96 percent customer service satisfaction rating 
at my last job. I really believe my view and application of customer service 
would be well-suited for this new position.”

245
 Chapter 14: Optimizing Collaboration with Business Associates
 
 “I can see that you’re trying to balance the price with quality. Although our 
price is more, our quality is better. Because you’re going to be using this 
widget for ten years, your reduced maintenance costs, fewer disruptions, 
and lower frustration with your staff will make ours a better value and pay 
for the difference by the third year.”
Finishing Up and Confirming 
Commitment
The final item on your agenda should indicate that the other party will make a 
decision at the meeting. In a summation-close, all you’re doing is confirming the 
details and gaining some level of commitment for that action. The commitment 
for action can be joint or one-sided.
In your summation-close, list the agreed-upon action items, services, or points 
with a commitment statement to confirm that you understand or that they’re 
committing to take action, providing you follow through on the listed items. 
This technique can also work internally with superiors and subordinates or 
at home.
Here are some examples of summation-closes:
 
 “So if we provide X and Y and Z, would we have a basis of doing business 
together?”
 
 “So what you’re saying is if someone solves X problem and Y problem, 
you’ll make the decision to work with that company, correct?”
 
 “I’m hearing you want us to X and Y and Z. Is that right? Terrific! What will 
you do then?”
Confirming commitment is the final step: the natural ending to a good decision. 
It reconfirms that your decision-maker is ready to act now, re-emphasizes your 
belief in yourself and your proposal, and helps assure that the decision-maker 
takes action. Here are some excellent ways to confirm commitment:
 
 “There’s no doubt in my mind that the solutions we’ve discussed are 
exactly what you need. Let’s go ahead and get started now.”
 
 “You’ve made me so happy by agreeing to marry me. I promise to spend 
the rest of my life making sure you never regret your decision. Now, let’s go 
tell our parents.”
 
 “I’m confident that you’ll be elated with this X. It will perform exactly as we 
discussed today. Let’s get this paperwork taken care of so it can start working 
for you right away.”

Part IV: Maintaining Efficiency When Working with Others 
Following Up Post-Mortem 
as One Final Effort
Sometimes when you fail to reach your objective at the appointment, the 
follow-up you do after the appointment can be more valuable than the 
appointment itself. Most people forget a large chunk of what you say at an 
appointment. They leave the meeting and walk back into their offices with 
backed-up items to address that have piled up in the last hour.
 
The best follow-up strategy is one that’s agreed upon and scheduled by both 
or all meeting participants. If you need another face-to-face or phone meeting, 
schedule it before the meeting adjourns. Following up always becomes harder if 
you leave it loose or to chance. “Sometime next week” is too vague — set a date.
 
You can make a great post-appointment impression with handwritten thank-
you notes. After every significant face-to-face meeting, I write them even 
today. These notes cut through a busy, overcommitted professional life.

f you have the basics of time management down, 
you’re ready to kick into high gear. Part V offers advice 
targeted to specific job levels and functions. If you’re an 
administrative assistant, for instance, you may have little 
control over your day-to-day responsibilities, but you’re 
expected to keep the boss’s schedule running as smoothly 
as a Swiss train. Chapter 15 can put you on the right track. 
If you’re in sales, you’ve hitched your time management 
wagon to prospects, so Chapter 16 helps you balance 
your time so you devote enough time to actually making 
the sale. Of course, business owners and executives, 
as well as corporate management, have to direct the 
activities of other employees — which means that as the 
boss, you’re only as time-efficient as your least-efficient 
staffer. Chapters 17 and 18 carry advice most critical to 
the management set.

 Taking care of business, steering clear of busy-ness
T
he absent-minded boss and the capable secretary (the power behind the 
office) are all-too-familiar stereotypes in TV and movies. You know, the 
bumbling department head who oversleeps on the day of the big presenta-
tion to the company’s biggest client? The administrative assistant comes to 
the rescue and whips up a presentation with minutes to spare, succeeds in 
winning over the CEO, and persuades the client to double their business — 
finally stepping back to give full credit to the ever-clueless boss.
I sure hope that most of international megacorporations aren’t operating 
under these circumstances! But I can say this with certainty: No matter 
how organized and capable the head of the department or company is, the 
administrative staff plays a key role in the smooth operations and ultimate 
success of any business. An organized and efficient assistant helps keep the 
boss and others in the department on track, often managing multiple appoint-
ment schedules, arranging meetings, facilitating communication, anticipating 
the needs of the organization, and responding to them in a proactive manner. 
A good assistant supports the department and business objectives and takes 
on duties that free up others at the management or executive level so the 
bigwigs can use their expertise to do what they do best: lead, sell, create, 
produce, or facilitate.
Virtually all the information in this book is of value to administrative staff. In this 
chapter, however, I zero in on the unique circumstances of the administrative 
person and how to use time management to further success — for the individual, 
the department, the boss, and the business.

Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Recognizing Common Pitfalls
For the administrative person, some responsibilities that come with the terri-
tory are prone to begetting busy-ness — meetings and phone calls, for exam-
ple. In and of themselves, they’re benign, but an inefficient participant may 
misuse, confuse, and abuse them. As an administrative assistant, answering 
the phone and taking notes in meetings may be part of your job description, 
which can put you at the mercy of others.
Getting a handle on busy-ness generators is important to your productivity, 
both on a daily and long-term basis. Administrative staff members are espe-
cially vulnerable to the following time-zappers:
 
 Regular meetings: In many meetings, a lot is discussed, little is shared, 
and even less is acted upon. Chapter 13 tells you how to take control 
of meetings efficiency — even when you’re not the one leading the 
meeting.
 
 One-on-one meetings: You may be trapped with a long-winded supervi-
sor or employee who frequently veers off topic. Chapter 9 helps you 
deal with talkative co-workers, and Chapter 12 includes tips on dealing 
with your boss.
 
 Phone calls: Calls may come from customers who have difficulty com-
municating what help they’re looking for. I tell you how to handle phone 
calls quickly and productively in Chapter 9.
 
 Piles of paper: Papers may seem to get moved from point to point on 
your desk — but never get filed, acted upon, delegated, or even recy-
cled. Check out Chapter 5 to discover how to handle paper just once.
 
 Stalled projects: You may get stuck waiting for direction from a supervi-
sor or co-worker who’s either unavailable or unwilling to offer a deci-
sion. In Chapter 11, I offer some strategies for decision-making that help 
a stalled project move forward.
Keeping Your Eyes on the Goal: 
Your Boss’s Lead
First and foremost, it’s critical for you to know your boss’s goals — from big-
picture vision (where does your boss see the company in five years?) to weekly 
or even daily to-do priorities. Without that understanding, you may put all your 
energy into creating an ultra-sophisticated, cross-referenced computerized 

251
 Chapter 15: Time Management for Administrative Staff
filing system that puts the Library of Congress to shame — when what’s really 
important to the boss and the company is high-touch customer service and 
time spent attending to clients. So get a hold of these goals and consider them 
your Ten Commandments from 9 to 5.
 
Over the course of my career, I’ve worked with some outstanding support 
staff — and others who, well, may have been better suited for another career. 
I can tell you that the one defining skill that the best assistants shared was 
this: They understood what made me tick. They made an effort to discover my 
goals and business priorities. They observed how I operated and liked to com-
municate. They found out my strengths as well as areas in which I relied on 
them for help.
Those assistants who caught on to my business approach were then able to 
complement my strengths with theirs — they were better able to be proactive 
and work independently. They were more productive and made efficient use of 
the eight-plus hours each day that we worked together. They became a critical 
member of the team. In this section, you find out how you can do the same.
Getting face time with the boss
Regular meetings with your supervisor are critical to making sure you’re 
in synch with his or her priorities and that you’re investing your time and 
energies into the appropriate tasks. You may run across owners of entrepre-
neurial startups, corporate department heads, and CEOs of Fortune 100 com-
panies. But as for meetings, there are only two types of bosses in the world: 
those who love meetings and those who hate them.
Boosting your admin image: 
Ask and you shall receive
The administrative assistant who builds a com-
municative relationship with the boss or depart-
ment, contains busy-work to a minimum, and 
recognizes and focuses on the critical goals is 
bound to be perceived as a valuable member 
of the team. Using your well-honed time-
management skills to coax order and more 
productivity from the staff helps the business 
and positions you as an indispensable player. 
I hope your boss recognizes this and rewards 
you well.
If not, it’s perfectly okay to remind the boss of 
what you contribute to the bottom line. When 
it’s time for performance evaluation, try to 
quantify your efforts as they pertain to sales: 
For example, by supporting a sales staff of 
three, you’re freeing up X amount of their time 
to devote to revenue-generating, which may 
translate to Y more sales for the company. Then 
do the math: Your efforts add Z dollars to the 
company’s bottom line. That ought to get the 
boss’s attention!

252
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Dealing with a meeting-phobe
I admit it: I hate meetings. I’m a driven, get-it-done guy who assumes that 
because I know what needs to be done, everyone else does, too. Besides, I 
don’t have time for meetings — there’s too much to do!
I know, I know — shame on me. But in the real world of business, meeting-
phobic managers are certainly not the exception. If you find yourself report-
ing to someone who’d rather have a root canal than sit in a meeting, it’s your 
challenge to wrangle regular face-to-face meetings in as painless a manner 
possible.
The key to convincing your boss to meet with you is to show her the benefit 
of regular meetings. Explain that by meeting regularly, she’ll get more done, 
reduce interruptions, and improve her chances for advancement and raises. 
Tell her that meeting for 10 minutes a day or 30 minutes a week will save her 
from having you come in to ask questions to clarify projects.
After you establish the value of these meetings, you’ll be more likely to con-
vince your boss that more time or greater frequency would benefit both of 
you. Start small and work up to that more-frequent or longer meeting. Also, 
be sure not to overstay your welcome. If the meeting is for 15 minutes, then 
be ready to leave at that point. Give your boss, not you, the power to extend 
the meeting. You’ll leave the boss wanting more, which is a good strategy.
 
If you can’t convince your boss to hold regular one-on-one meetings, try these 
other tactics to get more time with your boss:
 
 Make it informal. Instead of asking for a sit-down meeting, grab the boss 
for a stand-up conversation at the water cooler. Stop in — when you 
know things are slow — and ask whether it’s okay to interrupt with a few 
questions.
 
 Make it short. Whether scheduled or impromptu, keep the encounter 
brief — perhaps no longer than a half hour. Make sure that the boss 
understands from the outset that you’ll be quick. Perhaps begin with a 
statement like “I have three quick issues I want to run by you.”
 
 Make it productive. That means you should know exactly what you 
want to accomplish or find out from this exchange. Ask specifics rather 
than generalities: “Does the X project take priority over the Y project?” 
rather than “What are our priorities this week?”
Working for a meeting-phile
If you find yourself working for a meeting advocate, you shouldn’t have a 
problem with face-to-face communications. A boss who is partial to formal 
meetings may schedule a standing weekly meeting or even a daily status 
review.

253
 Chapter 15: Time Management for Administrative Staff
On the downside, a meeting-driven manager may be prone to micromanaging — 
getting involved in what you and other employees are doing and perhaps 
creating friction and inefficiencies. Having too many meetings diverts energy 
and resources from more-productive activities for you and the boss. And the 
excess can be a sign that your boss is avoiding decision-making and action.
If you find yourself meeting to death, you may need to step up and guide the 
meeting through specific questions that lead to action:
 
 “What is our agenda for this meeting?”
 
 “What are we hoping to accomplish by the end of the meeting?”
 
 “What action point do you want me to record?”
 
 “Who do I assign this to?”
 
 “What time frame should we attach to this?”
Asking the right questions
Now for a little reality check: Odds are your boss’s goals don’t exist in list 
form. In fact, your boss may not even be able to articulate these visions. In 
reality, many supervisors aren’t necessarily good communicators, effective 
time managers, or very well-organized. (So how did they ever get promoted? 
You’ll have to read another book to find that answer.)
 
You won’t always work for an individual who can communicate, is organized, 
manages time well, or even has leadership qualities. But that doesn’t let you 
off the hook for pursuing an understanding of your boss’s goals and objectives. 
It’s your job to seek out this understanding through observing, interacting, and 
questioning.
If your boss is unable to communicate well, you can ask questions to draw 
out the guiding goals and objectives. Try some of these to elicit information 
regarding big-picture goals:
 
 “Does the company have a corporate mission or vision?”
 
 “Where do you see this department in three years?”
 
 “What do you think is more important in the long-run: X or Y?”
 
 “How do you measure your own success in your job?”
A supervisor who’s ineffective at communicating big goals may also struggle 
to convey what’s important on a day-to-day basis. Your interviewing skills 
come in handy in this situation, as well. First, start with direct questions 
about what the boss wants:

254
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 “What do we have to accomplish?”
 
 “What are your priorities for me?”
 
 “How can I best support your efforts?”
 
 “How should I accomplish this task?”
 
 “What’s the standard in terms of quality?”
 
 “Who else do I need to involve? Who can provide me with more information?”
 
 “Can I check back to make sure that I’m heading in the right direction?”
 
 “Do we have any immediate problems to address before we can proceed?”
To flesh out further detail, employ what I call an add-on technique, attaching 
a time frame to your question to power up focus, production, and better time 
management. Here are some examples:
 
 “What do we have to accomplish this week/today/before lunch?”
 
 “What are your priorities for me for this quarter/this month/this week/in 
the next hour?”
 
Another technique I recommend is to follow up any of the boss’s responses 
with this question: Besides that, is there anything else? Here’s why: First, 
it helps identify anything else that needs your attention in the time frame 
given. Second, it forces your supervisor to pay attention to what he or she is 
saying. When people are busy, they have a tendency to switch to auto-pilot 
and not really think deeply about what they’re doing. By following up with the 
anything-else question, you give the boss an opportunity to stop and think 
through what he or she has just charged you with and determine whether 
everything has been covered.
Adopting Strategies to Stay On Track
Good news: Just because you leave work every day with a stack of papers on 
your desk or e-mail still sitting in your inbox doesn’t mean you’re doing a bad 
job. On the contrary, if you end each day with everything accomplished on 
your to-do list and ready to face the next day with a clean slate, you probably 
aren’t doing your job (that or your company may be in trouble).
Fact is, when a company finds itself scrambling to keep up with business, it’s 
usually a sign of robust health. And employees who are weighed down with 
the heaviest workloads are those who management considers indispens-
able. You’ve heard the old saw “If you want something done, give it to a busy 
person.”

255
 Chapter 15: Time Management for Administrative Staff
So when your boss hands you yet another top-priority project, consider it a 
compliment! What determines your success is how you protect your work-
space and focus from invasion and how you prioritize your work, tackling the 
tasks that are most important first.
Starting with a few simple steps
Sometimes you need to slow down in order to speed up, to put a halt to busy-
ness so you can get down to business. It’s easy to get sucked into a vortex of 
activity at the office, drowning in a whirlpool of tasks and to-dos so that you 
can’t even stop long enough to ask for help. Have you ever said to someone 
who offered to help you with a project, “I’m too busy; I don’t have time to 
show you how to help me”?
Too frequently, that frenzy of activity is obscuring the fact that, well, you’re 
not accomplishing very much. When you find yourself swimming in circles, it 
may be time to stop the frantic flailing and come up for air. By doing so, you 
may just discover you’re not as far from shore as you feared. Here are some 
steps you can take:
 
 Get to work a bit early so you can review, reload, and get ready for a 
productive day. Employees with refined time management skills arrive 
regularly from 5 to 15 minutes before their work shift. This is especially 
true for administrative staff — individuals who support supervisors or 
a group of people. As soon as the others arrive, they may commandeer 
your schedule. A quiet time to prepare for the onslaught helps minimize 
inevitable diversions.
 
 Work routine rest stops into your daily schedule to review and evalu-
ate your progress. I suggest scheduling at least 15 minutes at the end of 
the workday to take measure. Keep track of how you spend your time 
by assessing the tasks according to four main categories: revenue sup-
porting, service supporting, meetings, and project supporting. (Figure 
15-1 provides a snippet from a time-tracking sheet you may want to 
use.) Did you accomplish what you’d intended? What went well? What 
went poorly? Who and what interrupted your efforts? What changes 
would improve the situation? What do you need to accomplish tomor-
row? What adjustments to your schedule can you make?
 
 Take a work break in the middle of the day. You may be tempted to 
work through lunch, but working an eight-hour-plus day without a break 
to clear your head and step away will not help you accomplish more. If 
you don’t want to take an hour, fine. Get away for a half hour. Leave your 
desk behind and meet a friend for a quick bite or a walk. At least head 
for the company break room.

 Do not — I repeat — do not take lunch at your desk! You end up taking 
business calls, answering co-workers’ questions, and jumping up if your 
boss calls your name. You need at least 30 minutes to clear your mind, 
exercise your body, or enjoy a change of scenery so you can use your 
time more effectively the rest of the day.
Protecting peak productivity periods
Most people are at their peak in the morning hours. But whatever time you’re 
most productive, do your best to set aside that period for tasks that require 
greater attention and focus. If you can, relegate meetings, filing, simple 
administrative tasks, and other no-brainer activities to other times of day; 
devote your concentrated energies to challenging projects.

257
 Chapter 15: Time Management for Administrative Staff
Safeguarding your peak time may be tough. Administrative folks are typically 
extremely exposed to interruption. Often, their desks are set in an open area, 
accessible to everyone in the office. And these people are frequently respon-
sible for answering incoming calls for several people.
Here are a few tips for protecting your periods of peak productivity:
 
 Use the time-block system (see Chapter 4) to schedule your most 
productive hours.
 
 Say no to multitasking, which involves juggling several tasks at one time. 
(See Chapter 1 for more on the perils of multitasking.)
 
 Post a sign or implement some sort of signal to alert other employees 
to hold off interruptions until a given time. You may not be able to 
completely block disruption, but you can reduce it.
 
 Enlist your boss’s support in guarding your time blocks. Ask whether 
you can get phone relief during this time (maybe someone else can man 
the phones for an hour). If you can’t get help on a routine basis, at least 
ask about getting it as needed.
 
 When given a project with a deadline, make sure your supervisor under-
stands the time resources the task requires. (Bosses are notorious for 
underestimating the amount of effort required to complete a project.) 
He or she may then be more supportive of your need for distraction-free 
time blocks.
Getting your priorities in order
The first thing you need to do is make sure your priorities are straight. 
Whether you get that information from the boss or in a departmental meeting 
or you’re following your gut, you want to be clear on what’s most important — 
what projects command your attention first.
 
Typically, the money-generating activities (or in the case of an administrative 
assistant, the supporting activities that lead to money-generating activities) 
are what should come first. Having been in sales for more than half my life, I’m 
highly attuned to the importance of bottom-line activities. But the fact is that 
all companies are in sales to some degree. And all employees — even those 
who don’t sell or direct sales — are connected to the sales efforts of the firm. 
There’s really nothing more important in any company than increasing sales 
and therefore increasing profit.

258
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
You may be an administrative assistant in the IT department or in finance, 
but if the sales team fails, everyone in the company is at risk. So if you need 
to type a sales proposal, book a sales appointment for your boss, or send 
information that was requested by a new potential customer, these activities 
take precedence over the day-to-day paper pushing that most administrative 
staff members engage in. In a very real sense, your job and the future of the 
company rely on the sales department. Anything you can do to support and 
enhance sales efforts increases your value.
Seeking clarification about your objectives
Regarding activities whose priorities aren’t clear, there’s a wrong way and 
a right way to get clarification. Instead of posing an open-ended question 
(which is a good thing to do when you want to get people to talk), giving your 
boss a multiple-choice option can help narrow the focus and make it easier to 
get an answer to one:
Wrong: “Okay, what exactly is my priority here?”
Right: “I’m currently working on A, B, and C. In order to know how to best 
schedule my time, which one — A, B, or C — is the most critical?”
Now, let me throw you a trickier situation: Suppose you support several 
people in the department and two people are insisting that their project 
is priority. Your first step is to try to talk to the two of them together. By 
acknowledging the importance of both projects and linking the prioritization 
to a common goal, you’re more likely to get the two of them to mutually agree 
on the priority:
“I’ll do my best to get both of these projects completed as quickly as possi-
ble. But which project do you believe is the most critical to our department’s 
bottom line?”
If they don’t agree? Well, you’ll have to rely on the boss to be the tie-breaker.
Creating and qualifying a comprehensive task list
As soon as you’ve established your objectives, it’s time to make a list of 
everything you have to do. Administrative assistants tend to be good list-
makers — a skill that everyone should acquire. But there’s more to making a 
good list than meets the eye.
The key to constructing a good task list — whether on computer or with note-
pad and pencil — is to focus on the what. Getting diverted by the how and why 
drains the efficiency out of this important step in prioritizing. As you jot down 
those projects, don’t question, judge, or analyze a single item — just get them 
all down. By taking this productive step, you’ll find you have time later to dis-
sect the particulars of each project.

259
 Chapter 15: Time Management for Administrative Staff
 
Use the list-making tools that come with your software to keep track of tasks 
and projects. Microsoft Outlook, for example, has a Tasks feature. You can 
reorder, add, and eliminate items as much and as often as necessary without 
wearing out erasers and using up your notepad.
As soon as you have your full list, you’re ready to establish the order of 
attack. Instead of creating a numerical order from 1 to whatever, group the 
items based on when they must be completed (Note: This task follows the 
process I outline in Chapter 4, but because administrative assistants often 
don’t have the delegate and eliminate options, I’ve reduced the number of 
categories and broke them out according to the urgency of the task):
 
1. Critical to complete today
 
2. Preferable to complete today
 
3. Important to finish in the next few days
 
4. Can be completed within a week or longer
 
A common tendency for those who love lists is to finish the items that can 
be crossed off quickly. It’s so satisfying to see those checkmarks by the com-
pleted tasks — the more, the better. The smarter strategy, however, is to do 
the most important items first — not the ones that take the least amount of 
time to finish. That doesn’t mean, however, that you put your efforts only on 
that reorganization proposal, deferring everything else until it’s completed. 
It means you have to break down the big job into many smaller but critical 
steps. Thus, number one on your list for tomorrow is not “finish reorganization 
proposal” but rather “review staff suggestions for reorganization proposal.”
Did you cross off all your critical-to-complete-today tasks before you went 
home? That, in my book, is the measure of a successful day. A productive and 
efficient administrative person probably finishes the preferable-to-complete-
today items, and maybe a few others, before going home, ready to tackle the 
constantly adjusting list again the next morning.

Time Management for Salespeople
In This Chapter
 Diversifying your time investment effectively
 Concentrating on direct income-producing activities
 Balancing out with indirect income-producing activities
 Keeping production-supporting activities to a minimum
A
 salesperson does so much more than simply sell. A salesperson pros-
pects, qualifies, cold-calls, warm-calls, networks, follows up, generates 
leads, serves customers, asks for referrals, develops marketing plans, pre-
pares proposals, handles objections, role-plays and rehearses, researches, 
troubleshoots, files, mails, and asks for the close.
Yet all this boils down to that most fundamental function: making the sale. 
Boosting the bottom line. Generating revenue. Producing income. The efforts 
and energies of the salesperson all have to flow in the direction of selling. 
And the more time the salesperson can devote to making the sale, the more 
successful the salesperson becomes.
Top performers use their time more effectively to create leads at a higher 
rate per hour and invest less time convincing people to buy, to buy through 
them, and to take action now. In the world of sales, time management is a 
critical skill.
Through decades of experience as a sales leader, sales coach, motivational 
speaker, and consultant, I discovered that few sales professionals understand 
exactly how to effectively invest their time when faced with the many tasks 
required of the job. Early in my career, I developed a system for time manage-
ment that has served me and thousands of my clients well. By sticking with 
this program, I achieved and exceeded any sales goal I ever set for myself. And 
you can, too. In this chapter, I share these not-so-secret secrets with you.

Breaking Your Time-Investment 
Portfolio into Three Categories
Just as a good financial planner chooses diverse investments to balance a 
portfolio, a professional of any sort balances the way he or she invests time 
in the many job-related tasks required on a daily or weekly basis. And just as 
the well-balanced investment portfolio differs for individuals at various life 
stages, time investment varies according to profession.
 
For the salesperson, that time-investment portfolio divides naturally into three 
categories of activities that make up a salesperson’s job:
 
 Direct income-producing activities (DIPA)
 
 Indirect income-producing activities (IIPA)
 
 Production-supporting activities (PSA)
Figure 16-1 shows an ideal breakdown of your time into DIPA, IIPA, and PSA. 
When I take on a new client in my practice as a sales coach, the first thing I 
look at is where the salesperson invests his or her time. In the vast majority 
of cases, I discover the time allocation between DIPA and PSA is completely 
out of whack, with the person spending as much as seven hours a day on 
these production-supporting activities and as little as an hour — sometimes 
less — on tasks that produce income!

The money-makers: Direct income-producing 
activities (DIPA)
The job of a salesperson is to create and keep customers — after all, it’s 
through these customers that you generate income. To keep customers, you 
have to understand their expectations of service and performance and then 
ultimately deliver on that while communicating at regular intervals, checking 
the customers’ results, and gauging how satisfied they are with the service.
Any and all activities that lead to producing revenue for the company — and 
thus income for the salesperson — are considered direct income-producing 
activities, which I refer to as DIPA. What, exactly, can DIPA tasks consist of? 
Here are some of the biggies:
 
 Prospecting
 
 Cold calling
 
 Warm calling
 
 Calling on past clients to make more sales
 
 Seeking leads from your sphere of influence
 
 Networking
 
 Following up on leads
 
 Qualifying prospects
 
 Preparing and making sales presentations
 
 Overcoming objections
 
 Closing orders
 
The secret to success in sales is maximizing your DIPA time. The activities 
that comprise DIPA have a higher hourly value than anything else you do 
during the day. The most successful salespeople make a conscious decision to 
invest more time in DIPA as soon as they understand the value and power of 
actions directly linked to dollars.
How much time you can invest in DIPA depends on what you’re selling and 
on the support system behind you to service your customers and clients. 
At a minimum, you want to invest 60 percent of your time in DIPA daily. 
Certainly, more is better and increases sales more quickly. Also, you want at 
least half of that time to be in the prospecting and lead follow-up categories 
of DIPA.

264
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
As a sales professional, speaker, and coach, I’ve discovered three actions that 
lead directly to leveraging your career and increasing your income: personal 
development, role-playing, and evaluating personal progress (I discuss all three 
in the “Planning your day around DIPA” section, later in this chapter). I’ve yet 
to meet a salesperson who didn’t achieve top level when he or she consistently 
applied these three DIPA actions over time. The best news of all is that you can 
dive into these actions from day one of your sales career and never stop.
The prep work: Indirect income-producing 
activities (IIPA)
As a salesperson, you keep busy with a lot of actions that, although they don’t 
directly bring in income the way prospecting, following up on leads, or making 
a sales presentation does, are essential because they support these activities. 
Indirect income-producing activities, which I call IIPA, include the following:
 
 Developing programs to generate leads
 
 Creating marketing strategies
 
 Developing promotional pieces, such as brochures and mailings
 
 Encouraging brand-building and product awareness among the public
 
 Tracking, monitoring, and reviewing sales results
Although critical, IIPA shouldn’t be time-consuming — keep these tasks to an 
hour or so (or 10 to 15 percent) of your day.
Many salespeople have a pretty easy time finding the right balance of IIPA 
time. Those who find it more challenging tend to lean toward the marketing 
side of sales: creating new marketing strategies or perfecting sales processes 
or sales systems.
In coaching thousands of salespeople, I’ve observed that the overload of IIPA 
usually comes in bunches. It’s not a day-to-day problem but rather a weekly 
or monthly challenge. A salesperson devotes a few days straight to tracking, 
analysis, or marketing strategies, for example. But if you invest, say, even 80 
percent of your time for four workdays in a month, that equates to 26 hours 
of time invested in IIPA, for a total of 15 percent of your time.
 
Although important to your overall results, marketing efforts can consume 
more of a bite in your schedule than is warranted. Overinvesting time in IIPA 
can throw off your DIPA attention and, as a result, lower your sales. If you see 
evidence of this, here’s the solution: Pick up the phone now.

265
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
Administrative stuff: Production-supporting 
activities (PSA)
Numerous tasks support the direct and indirect income-producing activities 
(DIPA and IIPA). You know, all the administrative details (typing, process-
ing, copying, mailing, stamping, faxing, and filing) that are an unavoidable 
part of the job. These tasks don’t generate revenue or even indirectly lead to 
income, but you have to do them as part of the DIPA and IIPA process.
For example, calling on a prospect is clearly a DIPA action, and then develop-
ing a sales proposal for the prospect is an IIPA project. But the actual typing 
and sending of the proposal — and all this process entails — is a production-
supporting activity, or PSA. The administrative staff often manages these 
tasks, but even among the most fully staffed sales departments, the sales 
folks themselves have to handle some of the PSA tasks.
Your goal is to reduce the time you invest in PSA to the smallest amount 
possible. Are you controlling your time so well that you’re investing 10 to 
15 percent — or less — in this area?
 
Although DIPA can be worth thousands of dollars an hour, PSA time is prob-
ably valued at $10 to $20 per hour, depending on the market rate for good 
administrative help. The time you devote to the big-money activities is dimin-
ished, and you earn much less than you could.
Tracking Your Time to 
See Where You Stand
It’s hard to know exactly how much time you spend on DIPA, IIPA, and PSA 
functions unless you’ve tracked your activities over a period of time to deter-
mine an average. Taking stock is important, and it supports an undeniable 
truth in sales: When performance is measured, performance improves.
Recording your activities
By tracking your time usage, you’re guaranteed to increase your time effective-
ness. Figure 16-2 shows a form I use at Sales Champions to help our clients 

266
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
record and report how they use their time in half-hour increments. Most people 
have between 16 and 20 half-hour increments to invest at work daily. Here’s how 
to use this form to help you make the most of those increments:
 
 Keep the form with you and fill it out as you go. Don’t wait until the end 
of the day to complete it — you’re bound to forget something.
 
 Track yourself for at least a week — longer is better. This allows for 
daily anomalies and helps create more of an average workflow.
 
Repeat the time-tracking process at least every six months. Over time, habits 
and behaviors may creep into your routine to diminish your effectiveness. A 
routine check-up keeps you on track.
The indirect income-producing activities are more subtle, and the definition 
of IIPA is more fluid than the definitions of DIPA and PSA. For your sales prod-
ucts or the services that you sell, what you consider to be IIPA may be differ-
ent from what I do. There’s no question that prospecting or lead follow-up is 
a DIPA action; and there’s no question that faxing, mailing, licking, and stick-
ing are PSA actions. However, the middle ground is more open to interpreta-
tion. The ambiguity can lead to a misrepresentation of your time.

 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
 
My best coaching advice is to free yourself to decide which sales-creating 
actions fit in each category. Really define your DIPA, IIPA, and PSA actions and 
create a list for each category so there’s no guesswork and faking yourself out 
when your time allocation is off.
Evaluating your time-tracking sheets
The most successful salespeople are brutally honest with themselves and con-
front their strengths and weaknesses. They’re able to look at their performance 
in an objective, real, honest, and constructive fashion. To get the most out of 
your personal evaluation, you should assess where you currently are with your 
time management before you plan how to allocate your time, noting where you’re 
doing well and where you have room for improvement. Use your time-tracking 
sheets to identify how much time you spend in each category and when you per-
form tasks of a certain type. You can then use the review questions in this section 
during the self-evaluation sessions I talk about establishing in Chapter 4.
Looking back at your day
How often do you exclaim at the end of the day, “Where did the day go?” When 
you feel as though you’ve gotten nothing of significance done in the last eight 
hours on the job, go back and review the mix of PSA, IIPA, and DIPA. Then 
pinpoint the problems, plan for the next day, and nail down a schedule that 
ensures maximum productivity and keeps you on the path toward success. Ask 
yourself the following questions to identify what to change for tomorrow:
 
 When did you invest in DIPA in your day? Did you put off tackling your 
DIPA tasks until your day was derailed by interruptions?
 
 Were you so engrossed in IIPA tracking that you spent more time than 
you intended in analyzing the results?
A DIPA success story
Kim, a one-on-one coaching client of mine, is 
an outstanding salesperson based in Eugene, 
Oregon. Every week, Kim gives me a report of 
her sales activity and time-investment break-
down into DIPA, IIPA, and PSA. I’ve worked 
with her for a handful of years and watched her 
income skyrocket from just over six figures to 
approaching seven figures this year. Her secret? 
She makes certain that her DIPA accounts for 
75 percent or more of her time invested each 
week. She works an average of about 42 hours 
per week, with as much as 85 percent of those 
hours invested in DIPA. In addition, better than 
50 percent of the DIPA hours invested are in the 
prospecting and lead follow-up segments of 
DIPA. She spends very little time in PSA. It’s not 
a surprise that her income is higher than that of 
most heart surgeons in her town!

268
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 How did you break down DIPA time in terms of prospecting, lead follow-
up, and sales presentations?
 
 Did you lose momentum by jumping back and forth between prospect-
ing and lead follow-up?
 
Keep a level head as you evaluate your productivity by accepting that 
although today is gone, tomorrow is a new opportunity to get it right.
Reflecting on your week, month, quarter, and year
At the end of each week, wrap up with an evaluation of how you did, asking 
yourself the following questions. This needn’t take any longer than 90 minutes.
 
 How much time did you spend in each category? Is your time investment 
a little off-balance?
 
 How many contacts, leads, appointments, and sales did you complete? 
Were those numbers better or less than your goals for the week?
When you’re comfortable that you have a good handle on what happened 
this week, then evaluate what needs to happen next week:
 
 What needs to change next week to close any gaps?
 
 Which areas of DIPA do you need to focus on?
 
 How much DIPA time do you need to hit or exceed your sales goals?
 
 How can you increase the hours you invest in DIPA, and who or what 
can help you do so? What are the barriers to increasing DIPA time?
Repeat this process at the end of the month, quarter, and year, asking your-
self how far behind you are for the month, quarter, or year to date. Your 
monthly reviews may take a couple of hours; a quarterly evaluation, perhaps 
a half-day. And at the end of the year, you may want to set aside a day or 
two to replay the whole year. Your yearly reviews differ in scope from your 
weekly and monthly recaps because you’re looking for big-picture trends 
rather than daily or even hourly work routines.
 
Several years ago, my annual self-evaluation uncovered that if I don’t take an 
extended break from work at about the ninth week, my effectiveness drops 
dramatically. I need at least a five-day break to recharge my batteries. If I don’t 
put that break in my schedule, my intensity, focus, concentration, and results 
drop dramatically with each subsequent week.

269
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
Planning Your Day around DIPA
Your first step in improving your time management is to decide to make DIPA 
a priority, to commit to it, to just do it! Stuff happens, and this is no greater a 
truth than in the world of sales. If you don’t place your direct income-producing 
activities in your schedule, chances are that stuff will come along to comman-
deer your time — and the DIPA won’t get done. If you fail to plan out the where, 
when, and how of your DIPA for the week or day, you can plan to fail.
Letting the numbers scare you straight
After asking hundreds of thousands of sales-
people the normal amount of time they invest 
daily in DIPA and PSA actions, I’ve come to 
the universal numbers of two hours per day in 
DIPA and six hours per day in PSA. Does that 
sound like you? Here’s a scenario that’ll scare 
you straight. Say you earn $100,000 a year and 
work about 2,000 hours over that time. That 
means your value or worth is $50 per hour, or 
$400 a day.
Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? Even investing 
the majority of your time typing, filing, copying, 
and mailing, you’re making decent pay for sec-
retarial work. But consider this: Administrative 
skills have a market value of $15 per hour. So if 
you’re spending six hours of your day on PSA, 
your earnings for that time are a total of $90 — 
which means in the two hours you spend on 
DIPA, you’re earning $310, or $155 an hour. That’s 
more than ten times the value of your PSA time!
Here’s the time investment of a typical sales-
person:
  DIPA compensation: 2 hours × $155 = $310
  PSA compensation: 6 hours × $15 = $90
See where this is going? Yep, if you invert those 
activities — working six hours on DIPA and two 
hours on PSA, your earnings would be $960 a 
day, or $240,000 a year. I know you may feel sick 
at this point, realizing how much money you 
may be leaving on the table. That’s the normal 
reaction I get from salespeople when we look 
at the real numbers and costs of PSA. The good 
news is that now you’re aware that you have a 
choice in where you channel your efforts, you 
can make a change.
Everyone knows about lawyers and their bill-
able hours, the time they bill out to clients. I was 
recently having lunch with a friend, a long-time 
attorney, and asked him what his goal was for 
daily billable hours. “Seven hours,” he replied 
without pause. He knew his number.
Think of your DIPA time as billable hours 
and your PSA time as nonbillable hours. A 
$100,000-per-year salesperson who reduces 
PSA time by one hour per day and invests that 
hour in DIPA can see at least a $38,750 increase 
in income. In practice, the increase is typically 
more than that because the salesperson cre-
ates more momentum, increases his or her 
sales skills, and increases confidence.

270
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
Set out to increase your DIPA hours daily. Most salespeople invest less than 20 
percent of their workday in DIPA when they should be investing in excess of 
60 percent of their time in DIPA every day.
Picking time for DIPA and 
using that slot wisely
Because DIPA tasks are the most important, you want to put those actions 
in the part of your day when you have the most energy, intensity, and focus. 
When are you better, sharper, or thinking most clearly during your day? 
When do you have the most energy and greatest focus? For most people, this 
period of high productivity is typically in the morning.
 
Aligning your most productive time periods with your most important 
DIPA tasks is critical to your success on a daily basis. Whether you’re 
an up-at-daybreak person like me or more like my wife, Joan — whose 
engine is misfiring until her second latte kicks in some time between 9:00 
and 10:00 a.m. — you want to determine your personal prime time sooner 
rather than later.
The best way to arrive at your alignment is through personal observation. 
Monitor yourself for a few weeks. You may even journal through your day, 
finding the sweet spot where you’re most productive. You can also seek out 
the opinion of those who know you well. Ask your spouse or significant other, 
your co-workers, or your sales manager. You can even ask a parent, someone 
who’s followed your biorhythms from your birth.
 
If you discover that your best time of day is the afternoon or evening, be espe-
cially diligent in protecting that high-powered period. As your day progresses, 
you encounter more opportunities for stuff to happen and derail your plans 
for an afternoon of DIPA. I’m not saying you can’t do it, but just be aware that 
if you book your direct income-producing activities later in the day, you have 
to be extra wary of distractions, glitches, interruptions, and other trip-ups. 
(For advice on handling interruptions, see Chapter 9.)
Giving priority to prospecting
Too many salespeople and even some sales trainers lump in lead follow-up 
with prospecting. Big mistake! These two actions are very different. Prospecting 
is the act of generating leads. Lead follow-up is keeping in contact with the 
leads in order to convert the leads into appointments or customers. During 
lead follow-up, you can dump some leads because their desire, need, ability, 
or authority isn’t high enough or definable enough for you to serve them.

271
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
Combining prospecting and lead follow-up in one category is a mistake 
because most salespeople then take action only on the lead follow-up por-
tion. When you’re not creating new leads, your production and sales are only 
as good as the leads you have already. What happens if the leads are really 
low quality? What happens to your sales and earnings? Everything in terms of 
production, sales, and personal income is negatively affected.
 
I recommend investing at least 25 percent of your day — or at least two 
hours — to prospecting. You should also work to make that time consistent 
each day, meaning no bingeing on prospecting. Schedule the two hours each 
day and sew them in the schedule. Don’t get to the end of the week, find out 
you’re behind, and try to do marathon sessions to catch up.
Part of your prospecting investment is in qualifying prospects — determining 
their motivation, time frame, expectations, and experience; and which other 
companies may be competing for their business. You also want to know how 
they’re going to make the decision. The questions you ask, whether on the 
phone or in person, help you use your time in the most efficient manner by 
eliminating prospects who don’t exhibit the characteristics of a customer. The 
process also helps you craft the most on-target proposals to the prospects 
who do qualify as customers. Here are the three core elements to qualifying a 
prospect:
 
 How much? What’s the size of the potential order? What can you expect in 
orders for the future? Can this prospect buy other products and services 
from you? In the scope of your current clients, where does this prospect fit?
Getting off to a good start
I’m at my best first thing in the morning. I have 
a greater storehouse of energy to invest, better 
intensity, and laser-like focus at that time. One 
of my critical DIPA actions is writing (as in this 
book). So when I’m in the middle of a book, I 
devote my early-morning hours to writing. In 
fact, I often wake up extra early to squeeze 
more morning into my day. With a 6-year-old 
and a 2-year-old, most mornings at my house 
are like a fire drill (and about that noisy), so it’s 
not unheard of for me to be at my desk writing 
as early as 3:00 a.m.
When selling was my primary job — as it was 
for decades — I blocked my prospecting and 
lead follow-up time first thing in the morning 
as well (although I assure you I wasn’t calling 
prospects at 3:00 in the morning!). I wanted to 
be sure that I aligned the high-production time 
with high-production action.

272
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 How soon? What’s the time frame to buy? If the prospect is six months 
away from the final decision, a lot can happen to derail the sale. You 
also have to invest six months of calls, e-mail, question answering, meet-
ings, and presentations. However, if the prospect views you as a last-
minute entry to the game, the prospect may perceive you as too risky 
because you haven’t been part of the deliberations long enough. Some of 
selling is being there at the right time.
 
 At what cost? What’s the cost in terms of your time, effort, energy, and 
emotion to create a sale? Some customers take large volumes of time for 
little return. You need to determine the costs and ask whether the sale 
is really worth it.
See Chapter 14 for more on qualifying prospects and holding appointments 
with them.
Leaving time for following up on leads
Lead follow-up is the process of converting your leads into customers — or 
at least into appointments. During lead follow-up, you can dump some leads 
when you determine they don’t really meet the customer profile or it’s clear 
that they’re not in a position to buy at this time.
Continuing education: A lifelong journey
I remember attending my first professional 
sales seminar like it was yesterday. I was fas-
cinated with the speaker’s understanding of 
how to become more successful, how he broke 
success down to a simple series of actions. 
One of those actions was personal develop-
ment. He asked the attendees how many books 
they’d read in the last year. I was relieved we 
didn’t have to share our responses with the 
group. Reviewing the last few years out of 
college, I could count the number of books I’d 
read on the fingers of one hand. And it occurred 
to me at that moment that there was a direct 
connection between the low numbers in my 
bank account and the number of books read, 
seminars attended, and self-improvement CDs 
listened to.
That was 20 years ago. The amount of time 
and energy I’ve invested in continued learning 
and personal development is immeasurable. I 
couldn’t count all the books I’ve read or experts 
I’ve listened to, but I can tell you they far exceed 
the number of fingers and toes I have — and 
probably the total fingers and toes of my family, 
employees, and professional colleagues com-
bined. And undeniably, my bank account reflects 
the riches and wisdom I’ve collected.
Wherever you are in your journey of lifelong 
learning — whether you have a high school 
diploma or a doctorate degree; whether you’re 
fresh out of school or many miles into your 
career — you can reap great rewards from 
continuing the process of learning. Don’t feel 
limited to the confines of formal education; the 
knowledge you pick up from books, CDs, semi-
nars, continuing education courses, and com-
puter studies goes a long way in boosting your 
sales success.

273
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
You should be spending less time on lead follow-up than on prospecting. 
Shoot for a 2:1 ratio at a minimum, or an estimated one hour per day. If you 
invert this ratio, you may run out of leads sooner than you anticipate — and 
find yourself playing prospecting catch-up.
 
If you have an overabundance of leads, then swing the percentages to lead 
follow-up for a few days, a week at the most. Just don’t remain there too long, 
or you’ll find your new leads dwindling.
Blocking out time for sales presentations
Most sales are completed in the sales presentation, where you’re pressing 
flesh. This is the most obvious component of the DIPA time you invest. It’s 
also the segment of the sales process where you’re closest to converting the 
order, getting contracts signed, and earning your commission check.
 
Preschedule sales presentations in your time-blocked schedule. (Turn to 
Chapter 4 for more on time blocking.) As a salesperson, I knew how long a 
sales presentation took to conduct, so I typically had preplanned slots to 
do them. When I was prospecting, I’d use alternate-choice closes to garner 
appointments, such as “Would Wednesday at 1:15 p.m. or Thursday at 3:15 
p.m. work better for you?” It kept me focused on booking appointments, and it 
increased my effective use of time through better organization of my schedule. 
It also helped me avoid the poor technique that most salespeople employ, 
which is asking, “When do you want to get together?”
Planning for personal development
 
The books you read, seminars you attend, CDs you listen to, and videos you 
watch can all have a dramatic and positive influence your level of sales suc-
cess. When you invest your time into these learning activities, you can count 
on a healthy return. Although formal classes and classroom study are good 
ways to continue your quest for knowledge, you can squeeze in lots of learning 
opportunities without giving up vast amounts of time. Here’s how:
 
 Sign up for seminars. Sales and motivational experts make speaking tours 
to many cities throughout the country, and they frequently offer work-
shops or programs that may be no more than a day or a half-day in length.
 
 Turn your car into an audio university. Make the most of your com-
mute. Turn off your favorite top 40 station or talk radio show and stick 
in a book-on-CD instead. Use the time to expand your knowledge about 
your industry, your career, or human psychology. With the amount of 
time you spend in your car over the course of a year, you can theoreti-
cally put in enough hours to earn a college degree.
 
 Learn while you fly. Turn business travel into an opportunity to bone 
up on a new topic. After you reach that comfortable flying altitude, 
you’re free to turn on the laptop or pop on your earphones for CD study.

Role-playing: Getting ready for prime time
I put a great deal of emphasis on role-playing in preparing for appointments 
and sales presentations. These dress rehearsals are much more than a fun 
and frivolous exercise; they’re a critical step in increasing a positive outcome 
from a direct income-producing experience. If you invest your time in role-
playing, and perfect your scripts and delivery skills, you’re bound to grow 
your sales results.
 
The time to practice isn’t when your commission check is on the line! Here are 
some tips for working in some practice through role-playing:
 
 Set a time and place to role-play and put it in your schedule. Don’t book 
appointments in your role-playing time — protect role-playing as if it were 
an appointment itself. Role-playing is usually the first thing salespeople 
cut when they get busy.
 
 Start with your appointment-setting techniques. These are the most 
important because if you can’t get in front of the prospect to make a 
presentation, it doesn’t matter how good your presentation is.
 
 Enlist a partner. To really role-play well, you need a partner. Why not 
practice on someone other than a prospect? You can find another sales-
person in the office or you can ask someone who has a vested interest in 
your career.
 
 Early in my sales career, my wife, Joan, listened to literally thousands of 
my sales presentations, objection-handling scripts and dialogues, and 
trial and final closes. In fact, to this day she could probably outsell most 
of the salespeople in the field because she knows the scripts and can 
deliver them!
 
 Have your partner offer various responses (without setting out to 
antagonize you). The objective of role-playing is to develop good skills 
and gain confidence. You want to practice making the sale. You want 
stalls, objections, and problems brought forth from your role-playing 
partner. The other person just doesn’t have permission to be a jerk.
To improve the quality of your message, you can rely on the two following 
theories:
 
 The X Theory of Success: Becoming proficient at anything always takes a 
certain amount of time, which I call X. X is different for each person because 
it’s based on innate talents and previous experiences and skills. The more 
talents and previous experience you have, the less practice you need.
 
 For example, to deliver your presentation with power and conviction, 
handle objections, and persuade the prospect to sign the contract, you 
may need 100 practice sessions. I may have a tougher time and may 

275
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
need to practice 200 times before I get it down pat. However, the issue 
isn’t that I take twice as long as you to achieve success but that I have 
an idea of where X is and that I’m working toward it regularly.
 
 The Y Theory of Choice. After you know how many times you have to 
practice your presentation, you can choose how long you’ll take, which 
is the Y Theory of Choice in action. You can take ten years, five years, 
two years, one year, or perhaps even just six months. For example, if 
I conduct my presentation live only in front of prospects and don’t prac-
tice, it’ll take me a long time to reach my 200. If I’m in front of prospects 
three or four times a month, I may need more than five years to com-
plete my 200 presentations.
 
Your success in improving the quality of your message is determined by 
crossing the finish line (X) and using the shortest amount of time (Y) to get 
there. A top salesperson uses a combination of presentations to prospects 
and a larger number of practice or role-playing sessions to advance further 
faster when striving to improver message quality.
Evaluating your sales presentation performance
 
The time you invest in evaluating your personal performance absolutely earns 
a DIPA rating. What you do with your time, how you invest it, how you make 
decisions, how you use your skills, how you work to improve — all these 
actions influence your personal productivity, and all warrant your most honest 
attention. (Although some people may feel that self-evaluation is IIPA, I really 
believe most salespeople don’t invest enough time in evaluation, limiting their 
improvement.)
If you have aspirations to improve and increase your income, you have to be 
willing to critique your performance. Ask yourself the following questions:
 
 How is your opening statement? Does it create a high level of connection 
and interest?
 
 Do you harvest viable leads?
 
 How effective is your lead follow-up sequence?
 
 How well do you deliver your sales presentation?
 
 Do you give yourself high marks in confidence, conviction, enthusiasm, 
and assertiveness?
 
 Do you listen or speak more than your prospect?
 
 How well do you present benefits aligned with the needs of prospects?
 
 What’s the conversion rate of leads to sales presentations? What’s the 
conversion rate from leads to sales? What’s the choke point to improve-
ment in this area?

276
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Also do sublevel evaluations for a sales presentation in the area of objections-
handling and closing. These two areas really separate the top-level salespeople 
from the middle of the pack:
 
 How well do you know the objection scripts furnished by your company? 
Do you practice them weekly?
 
 Can you deliver them under pressure in a sales presentation with 
eloquence?
 
 At the end of an objection that a prospect raises, can you shift to closing?
 
 In closing, do you ask for the order in closing more than four times?
Honest personal evaluation takes guts. Focusing on your problems, mistakes, 
and faults isn’t fun. Although many salespeople may rank prospecting as their 
least-favorite activity, I suspect that personal evaluation is really the most diffi-
cult task. But if you never look in the mirror, you may never glimpse those ugly 
truths and correct them so you can achieve the success you deserve.
Scheduling your DIPA time
To make sure you focus on the most essential direct income-producing activi-
ties, be sure to separate out the most important and devote a specific amount 
of time to each. Of the many DIPA functions that you regularly undertake, 
a handful are critical to perform regularly, if not on a daily basis. To stay 
focused, set aside time specifically for each function. Don’t lump everything 
together in a single DIPA time slot.
As you schedule time for your direct income-producing activities, consider 
these tips (and see Chapter 4 for more-detailed guidance on scheduling your 
time):
 
 Batch like activities together. Don’t make two prospecting calls, do a 
couple of lead follow-up calls, and then go back to more prospecting. 
This disintegrates into multitasking, which is inefficient.
 
 Set aside at least one hour at a time. Give yourself enough time to build 
momentum for greatest productivity.
 
 Schedule a break between activities. Giving yourself 15 minutes to 
stretch your legs, return some calls, or even get a cup of coffee enables 
you to clear your mind and transfer your thinking to a new prospect, 
lead follow-up call, or other action.

277
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
Incorporating IIPA into Your Day
After you’ve worked your schedule around your direct income-producing 
time, it’s time to fit indirect income-producing activities (IIPA) into your day. 
Because they aren’t linked as closely to bottom-line measures, IIPA tasks 
shouldn’t take up as much of your energy, but in no way should you overlook 
them, either. Your goal is to budget time for them but keep them from eating 
into the most lucrative activities.
Using IIPA time to review sales results
By figuring out what works — and what doesn’t — you can channel your 
efforts into activities that multiply your income. Examining how many leads a 
particular marketing piece generates, tracking the conversion rate of leads to 
sales, and plotting average order and average commission all fall under IIPA.
The time you spend gathering and analyzing data doesn’t earn you money 
directly, but it does show you what works and which DIPA efforts you may 
need to tweak. For example, say your tracking reveals that from 20 leads, you 
convert only one of those to a sale. The barrier is likely between the leads 
and the sales presentation. I’m simplifying (you may have problems at the 
presentation level or at other stages, too), but the point is that by analyzing 
each step of the sales process, you can zero in on your strengths and areas of 
further work. Here’s what you may discover from results tracking:
 
 You’re pursuing low-quality leads. This may be true, but most of the 
time, it’s not the case. Check with the other salespeople — if they’re 
achieving low results from these leads, the problem probably is with 
the quality of the leads. However, if other salespeople are booking five 
appointments to your one appointment, look elsewhere for the problem.
 
 Your lead follow-up strategy is off. Take a look at your lead-qualifying 
tactics. You may not be doing an effective job of determining the time 
frame, motivation, and urgency of your prospects. You may not be 
assessing the level of competition or the level of commitment. The 
result is that you end up spending a lot of time pursuing individuals 
who should’ve been eliminated during your lead investigation. (Flip to 
Chapter 14 for info on qualifying prospects.)
 
 You failed to grab the prospect’s interest. From the first moment of 
contact, you have seven seconds to hook a prospect. You need to hit 
that prospect between the eyes with your value proposition. What ben-
efits you are offering with what you’re selling?

278
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Keeping IIPA in check
 
To keep IIPA in check while staying on top of everything, I suggest these three 
tactics:
 
 Relegate IIPA to the afternoon. Unless you don’t fully engage in the day 
until noon, you want to set aside the morning for your most important 
income-producing activities. IIPA functions typically don’t require the 
same level of energy as DIPA. And because they aren’t as critical as 
DIPA, holding off on IIPA ensures that you wrestle the most important 
activities first, before something comes along to derail your day.
 
 Keep IIPA to an hour per day. Marketing, evaluating others’ sales 
performance, analyzing your lead follow-up, scheduling the next day’s 
setup, and reviewing call sheets are all effective uses of IIPA time, pro-
vided you don’t spend hours daily doing them.
 
 Use the end of the day to prepare for tomorrow. One of the best uses 
of IIPA time is preparing your sales calls, sales strategy, opening state-
ments, and call objectives for the next day. Investing a mere 30 minutes 
today means you’re able to instantly click into DIPA tomorrow. You’ll be 
less likely to stall, evade, and avoid the calls if your call sheets or call 
logs are on your desk.
Even if you do most of your prospecting and lead follow-up out of your com-
puter customer relationship management (CRM) program (see Chapter 6), 
I still encourage you to at least print out a hard copy of your calls on paper 
during your IIPA time today before you leave. Engaging in creative avoidance 
is harder when you see all these names on a page rather than on a computer 
screen.
Decreasing Your PSA Time
The goal of any salesperson is to get those administrative production-support 
activities (PSA) down to well under two hours a day, freeing up more time for 
prospecting, calling, lead follow-up, and other direct income-producing activities 
(DIPA). Awareness is the first step toward the proper alignment of DIPA to PSA. 
For a good gauge of where your time is going, track your daily activities for a 
period of several weeks using the form in Figure 18-2, earlier in this chapter.
 
Armed with the understanding that spending time on PSA saps your DIPA ener-
gies, you may be tempted to set a zero-tolerance policy for PSA. The truth is 
you’ll never be able to avoid PSA actions completely, even if you employ an 
army of administrative help. Here’s the conundrum: The more you invest in 
DIPA, the more PSA actions you generate. The two are interconnected. You make 
prospecting calls (DIPA), and a prospect wants a brochure, marketing material 
about a product, a quote, or even a sales proposal (PSA). Or you make a sale to a 

279
 Chapter 16: Time Management for Salespeople
prospect (DIPA), and you now have to write the order, turn it in, follow up on the 
order and administrative team, coordinate delivery, check back to make sure the 
customer is delighted and using your product, and possibly train the customer on 
the use (PSA). So frustrating though it may be, generating more PSA work because 
you’re increasing your sales is a good thing. Your goal is simply to keep the PSA in 
check, making sure that you keep your DIPA-to-PSA ratio at a healthy 6:1.
 
PSA functions surrounding sales tend to be recurring, requiring weekly or 
even daily attention. Here are several ways to keep these supporting tasks on 
a firm leash:
 
 Streamline the process. Determine whether you can create a system 
to make a PSA process faster, possibly eliminating some unnecessary 
steps. It takes almost as much time to assemble one marketing material 
package and brochure as it does ten; invest the time to create the ten 
and have nine ready to go out the door.
 
 Create templates. Don’t craft a sales or lead follow-up letter from 
scratch each time. The same goes for proposals. You can take a basic 
format and customize it for individual use.
 
 Batch your work. Make your PSA calls one after another. Bunch 
together the PSA actions as much as possible so you can move quickly 
from one similar call or action to another.
 
 Eliminate the step. Sometimes examining the process reveals that you 
don’t need to do a particular task at all.
 
 Delegate. Is administrative help somewhere in your sales department? 
Can you find someone to lend a hand? Can internship programs provide 
some eager business students who want to learn the business from the 
ground up? A talk with your sales manger may help.
 
 Hire help. If you can’t get support within your department, are you 
willing to pay a few bucks for it? Maybe you can hire a college or high 
school student, a stay-at-home parent, or a part-timer who just wants 
a low-pressure opportunity to earn a little money. For many of the PSA 
tasks that aren’t proprietary, the work can be done off-site.
 
 Remember: If you don’t have an assistant, you are one. What I mean 
is this: If you don’t have someone you can delegate the mailing, faxing, 
research, typing, low-level customer service, and a host of other actions 
to, you become the administrative assistant — and you earn your 
income commensurately.
 
 Turn PSA work into DIPA work by asking for a referral. When you have 
to do PSA work, you can often take the opportunity to get in a little DIPA 
action at the same time. For instance, customer service follow-up calls 
are part of your PSA. Checking to confirm that the prospect or client has 
received expected materials or information is a routine task that doesn’t 
relate directly to generating income. But don’t stop there — get some 
extra mileage from this PSA effort by turning your customer service call 
into a prospecting call: Ask for a referral.

280
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
It’s never too early in a sales relationship to begin building a referral base. A 
truly qualified referral request, however, takes a little time and attention. Be 
ready to invest at least five minutes in conversation to avoid appearing like a 
hit-and-run referral driver. You may use a great segue statement like this: “I 
have a very important question to ask you.” This statement forces a pause, 
builds anticipation, and sets the tone for a meaningful conversation. And it 
requests permission to explore client or prospect contacts. You may even 
use a script like this to help you:
 
 “I’m delighted that I’ve been able to serve you. I was wondering about 
others you might know who would also benefit from my service. 
Could we explore for a few minutes other individuals you believe I 
might be able to serve?”
Questioning the way it’s done
My friend Zig Ziglar tells a story about a 5-year-
old boy watching his mother prepare a holiday 
meal. The boy asks her why she cuts off the 
end of the ham. “I don’t know,” she says. “My 
mother always did it this way.” Now the boy 
says, “Let’s call Grandma and find out why.” So 
they call Grandma and ask her why she always 
cut the end of the ham off. Her reply? “The pan 
was too small.”
People often continue to do their jobs a certain 
way because that’s the way they’ve always 
done it. Sometimes the original reason for doing 
it is no longer relevant. Critically questioning 
your production-support activities can help 
identify and eliminate needless tasks, freeing 
up your energy for more-important activities.

C
orporate executives and business owners are two of the most 
stressed-out and time-shorted categories of workers in the business 
world. A number of circumstances heighten the time pressures on these 
folks: Company leaders are charged with creating strategic plans and carry-
ing them out. Entrepreneurs in the start-up stages are taxed with nurturing 
a fledgling business until it can fly on its own. And both feel the burden of 
bottom-line pressures: Is the company hitting the revenue goals? Are you 
making a profit? Are you growing the way you should? Are you in the black?
I’ve observed another interesting thing about these business leaders: Even 
after they’ve succeeded in launching and maintaining a viable and thriving 
enterprise, they can’t seem to get off that fast track, gotta-do-everything-
myself, 24/7 treadmill. Even when the business stabilizes and matures, these 
executives and owners struggle against pulling back, balancing their lives, 
and transitioning away from their insane work schedules. They seemingly 
become addicted to time deprivation.
If you suspect you’re addicted to work stress, read on. In this chapter, I walk 
you through a successful withdrawal process to help you grow your business, 
empower your employees, and take a look at the big picture. It’s painless, I 
promise. And I’m with you every step of the way.

Stepping Back and Observing 
Your Time Investment
 
Owners and executives may believe that a million things a day eat away their 
time. But in his book The E-Myth (HarperCollins), entrepreneur Michael E. 
Gerber claims that all the time spent falls into one of three big categories — 
and your business success depends on your ability to align these three realms 
in your schedule so you achieve the right balance:
 
 Growth activities: Expansion, increasing the customer base, adding to 
the product or service line, and other growth-oriented energies are what 
drive the long-term success of the business.
 
 Work in the business: This includes the administration, management, 
and internal operations of the company — in essence, what occurs 
within the company.
 
 Work on the business: These activities often involve stepping back and 
evaluating what’s happening, assessing challenges, and looking for new 
opportunities.
To get your time under control, you have to be able to identify how you’re 
spending it. The process is just like following a household budget: Before 
you can successfully manage your paycheck, you log your expenditures to 
determine where it’s going.
Time-tracking is important for everyone, but executives and business owners 
can especially benefit from this self-knowledge. I use the chart in Figure 17-1 
to help my clients monitor their time usage daily in each of the three time 
categories: growth, in, and on work.
What I’ve discovered over the years is that after tracking their time for a few 
weeks, most executives discover that they spend more than 80 percent of their 
time on working in the business. They typically spend less than 15 percent in 
growth activities and less than 5 percent working on the business. I’ve also 
found out that this is not the best time-mix formula for a successful business.
 
Owners and executives should invest 40 percent minimum in growth, no more 
than 25 percent in working in their business, and at least 15 percent of their 
time working on the business. I’m not a dilettante about the percentages — 
they vary upon your circumstances. You have some wiggle room to increase 
growth and on activities and even reduce the in, but this formula offers an 
excellent guideline. (And the best way to stick to the guideline is through the 
application of a time-blocked schedule. Turn to Chapter 4 for more on that.)
After tracking your time daily, use the T-chart in Figure 17-2 for an entire 
week, compartmentalizing your week in the three areas of growth, in, and 
on. It’ll give you a road map so you can determine what to delegate and to 

283
 Chapter 17: Time Management for Business Owners and Executives
whom you should delegate the lower-value in activities. You need only write 
an action or activity down once. At the end of the week, walk through the 
actions and determine how to delegate the low-value ones to another person 
or remove those activities. If you have to keep those activities, try to figure 
out where you may put these actions in the schedule so you can do them 
more efficiently or at a time when your energy is lower.

Increasing Time on Growth Activities
When identifying growth activities, look for things that offer long-term returns 
on investment. In the world of sales, for instance, direct income-producing 
activities (DIPA) are always considered growth activities (turn to Chapter 16 
for more on DIPA). Here are some examples of growth areas:
 
 Prospecting for new customers
 
 Following up on sales leads
 
 Developing customer service strategies to maintain and up-sell existing 
clients
 
 Coaching and training staff
 
 Developing yourself professionally
 
 Developing strategic alliances
 
 Launching new products or services
Such growth activities demand a higher focus and energy level than the in 
and on work categories. That’s why it’s wise to schedule these efforts first 
rather than last. Use a time-blocking system (see Chapter 4) to schedule your 
growth activities, and tackle them when your energy level is at its peak — 
before the day’s troubles and surprises start sabotaging your schedule.
 
The amount of time you devote to growth depends on your work. If your busi-
ness is sales, I recommend dedicating no less than 50 percent of your day to 
growth, whether you’re actively selling or leading a sales team. If you’re leading 
a team in an area other than sales, I recommend spending at least 40 percent 
of your time in growth. Whether you should set aside time on a daily or weekly 
basis depends on your job, but it’s likely to be a daily activity.
Track the percentage of your overall time spent on growth: Do a back-end 
analysis to verify that you’re putting in the necessary amount of effort. You 
may have a day spent putting out fires, but evaluating your growth activity 
regularly allows you to allot the needed catch-up time before the week is out.
Your success in allocating the proper amount of time to growth activities 
requires a commitment. Start by setting a goal to spend a specific number of 
hours on a daily or weekly basis. Write it down and post it where you can see 
it each day. Put a sticky note on your computer monitor or put an index card 
on your bulletin board or even on your mirror at home. This visual reminder 
reinforces your good intentions and helps you discipline yourself to stay 
focused on growth.

285
 Chapter 17: Time Management for Business Owners and Executives
 
Sticking with activities that don’t bring an immediate return takes discipline, 
and growth activities are definitely a long-term investment. If necessary, share 
your growth commitment goals with others: a colleague, your administrative 
assistant, or another executive.
Responsive Tasks: Decreasing 
Your “In” Time
Here’s an astute observation from British scholar C. Northcote Parkinson that 
has become universally embraced as Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands to fill 
the time available for its completion.” It’s no more apt than when describing 
the activities of the in-the-business category — you know, all the administra-
tion and management stuff.
 
Awareness is the first step toward reducing the in time investment in your 
business. Identify the in activities and how much time you’re spending on 
them, and you’re soon on your way to whittling them down. I have one simple 
measure for recognizing in activities: In most cases, they’re responsive tasks: 
efforts generated by some external trigger. This trigger can be a staff person 
who has asked for direction or a customer who has a question about your 
product. These activities aren’t necessarily one-time incidents; the same exter-
nal triggers can create fixed routines that end up on your desk. Consumer 
inquiries, for example, lead to a standard response process that involves send-
ing out an information packet. Or the need for your employees to keep you in 
the loop results in a weekly staff meeting. These triggers — all part of doing 
business — often turn into processes and procedures that demand your atten-
tion and keep you working in the business.
The reports, the ordering, the return phone calls, the administration and fill-
ing orders, and keeping order and all the routine details that must be done — 
it’s easy to let them consume all your time because they all need to be done. 
And frequently, they’re activities that take little thought or effort — or even 
time. Problem is, in total they derail all the effort and energy you ought to be 
putting into growth and working-on-the-business activities. This section tells 
you how to cut in activities down to size.
Solidifying your organizational chart
The hierarchical structure you follow can have an impact on the effective time 
management for you and all the employees within that structure. Unfortunately, 
especially with a young company, when a business grows too fast or changes 

286
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
too drastically, it’s easy to end up with an organizational chart that’s stunted or 
entangled with limbs that just get in the way. When this happens, you can count 
on more of the workload shifting to the executive and leadership branches of 
the company.
Businesses that rely on a build-as-you-go organizational chart typically end 
up with the same structure. And it looks something like Figure 17-3.
The owner or key executive is the hub of the wheel, and all the areas, 
departments, or segments of the business connect to the hub. All decisions, 
employees, customers, and problems end up on the center desk. Under 
this structure, the employees are rarely empowered to make decisions at a 
level that makes operations efficient. In fact, this type of structure results 
in constant involvement from the hub, which means regular interruptions, 
low productivity, high frustration levels, and more work hours. Hub leaders 
find themselves staying late and working weekends, not because business is 
booming but because they’re too busy juggling all the hats to get three, four, 
or more jobs done by the end of the work day.
 
Business leaders, be warned! Without a clearly established hierarchy that dis-
tributes decision-making and empowers employees, you — the executive or 
owner — get stuck as the hub, impaled by a circle of spokes.

What’s most important for an effective organizational structure is a hierarchy 
with a solid foundation. And the traditional pyramid organizational chart, shown 
in Figure 17-4, is most widely used for good reason. It allows for the logical 
distribution of responsibility and decision-making — and level-appropriate 
weights — to a larger base. It relies on a chain of command in which the 
responsibility levels are clearly defined. This structure fosters a sense of 
ownership and responsibility at all levels. The upshot? Employees who have 
a clearly defined organizational chart to follow with a strong set of job tasks 
or job descriptions feel the highest sense of ownership, and what gets owned 
gets done!
Crafting clear job descriptions
Hiring capable people allows you to spend fewer hours in your business, and the 
first step to getting the right folks in the right seats is to have a clear set of job 
descriptions. You need to know precisely what you want the candidate to do.
However, good job descriptions are just as essential for your current employ-
ees. After all, the best way to keep yourself from hovering over the desks of 
your employees is to give everyone a clear idea of what’s expected of them 
and then let them do their jobs. If all your employees are armed with a clear 
understanding of their responsibilities, you’re bound to spend more time 
making progress and waste less time stepping on or over each other — and 
your pyramid organizational structure (see the preceding section) is much 
more likely to stand the test of time.

Be sure a detailed, clear job description exists for each person on your staff 
or in your company — including you. You should be as familiar with a job 
description as the employee in that position is. A good job description should
 
 So clearly describe the particular role in the company that it could be 
used as a want ad that would bring in the ideal candidate for the job
 
 Be so detailed that your employee can use it as a pretty good guide to 
follow — even in your absence
Think specifics: Sure, your sales reps are supposed to sell your product, but 
that’s not enough for a job description. What, exactly, do they sell? How do 
they sell? What must they do in order to sell — make phone calls? Set face-
to-face appointments. Go door-to-door? How often? Monthly? Weekly? Daily? 
Hourly? And there’s more. Does their job require certain skills? What’s their 
top priority? Second priority? Third? Do they have to know how to use a com-
puter? Certain software programs? What decisions do they have authority to 
make? Who, within the company, must they interface with?
 
Putting together a solid job description is more science than art, and it often 
requires someone with a human resources sensibility. In an existing company, 
check with the HR department first — you may discover that job descriptions 
exist for the positions you need to define. Or maybe you can start with an 
existing description as a template to develop new descriptions.
Let my people delegate!
The challenges of building sound organizational 
structures are not just a 21st-century problem. 
In fact, this organizational overload has been 
around since Biblical times. Even Moses had 
his struggles with spreading the work. After 
leading the Israelites out of Egypt and into the 
wilderness, he found himself settling all the dis-
putes for the whole nation of Israel. (Perhaps 
those run-ins with the Pharaoh made him par-
ticularly sensitive about “pyramid structure”?)
A typical day started first thing in the morning 
when Moses took his “seat of judgment” and 
ended at dark. It took his father-in-law, Jethro, 
the original productivity coach, essentially to 
say, “Wait a minute. Why are you the only one 
charged with this job?” Some translations indi-
cate he said, “This is not good. You’re going to 
wear yourself out and the people, too.” Jethro 
then coached Moses through developing the 
first organizational chart and delegating some 
of the decision-making to others.

289
 Chapter 17: Time Management for Business Owners and Executives
Creating room for growth with 
supplemental task lists
A supplemental task list — to complement a job description — provides 
employees room for growth and advancement. It also strengthens the base of 
your organizational pyramid, allowing you to delegate more tasks and lighten 
your own load. The supplemental list includes the tasks you want to transfer 
to employees from either yourself or someone else in your department. For 
instance, a task list for an administrative assistant may look something like this:
 
 Answer all incoming calls, screen calls, and take care of any calls that 
you can handle, if not take complete messages.
 
 Return phone calls (within three hours or at least same day).
 
 Open and distribute all incoming mail, except anything marked personal.
 
 Schedule all appointments and make sure that they’re reflected in the 
scheduling program or day planner.
 
 Review the daily appointments; send thank-you notes as necessary.
 
 Complete all correspondence in a timely manner.
 
 Order supplies. Keep enough on hand so you won’t run out at any time.
 
 Handle all mailing functions — sending mailings, buying postage, and so on.
 
 Update and maintain current mailing lists.
And here’s a sample task list for a salesperson:
 
 Make 105 outbound calls daily.
 
 Make contact with at least 25 people per day.
 
 Complete 125 contacts weekly.
 
 Schedule 15 sales presentations weekly.
 
 Conduct ten sales presentations weekly.
 
 Sell five water filtration systems weekly.
 
 Practice scripts, dialogues, and objection handling for 30 minutes 
every day.
 
 Complete daily tracking report.

Devising a management plan
 
One step toward managing the in work is to develop and use an effective man-
agement plan. You don’t need a manual the size of the New York City phone 
book; a management plan is simply a set of key guidelines and procedures that 
you and your staff can follow for greater productivity and focus on the goals. 
Here are some tips:
 
 Base it on the core values. A key component of your management 
plan is the core values and goals — the mission of your company (see 
“Balancing Your ‘On’ Time,” later in this chapter). The mission serves as 
the umbrella under which everything else is sheltered.
 
 Plug in the organization chart. Establishing the who’s-responsible-for-
what flow helps keep everyone — including you — on the right track 
(see the earlier “Solidifying your organizational chart” section).
 
 Add the job descriptions. Include the detailed job descriptions of each 
person on your staff — and don’t forget your own (check out the two 
preceding sections).
 
 Gather activity-tracking charts on everyone in your company/depart-
ment. Have your staff fill out the activity-tracking chart in Figure 17-1 so 
you have a better idea of where everyone spends time currently.
As these components come together to form the management plan, you’re 
bound to discover you still have some gaps in data. To gather that information, 
answer questions such as the following:
 
 How many people do you interact with regularly? How many people 
should you interact with?
Developing workers’ talents: 
The secret of great leaders
Who’s a great leader is always apparent when 
you look back to see how many of that leader’s 
people advanced through the ranks to hold 
higher positions. You can find one of the best 
examples of this phenomenon in the field of 
athletics. Look at great football coaches, for 
example, and note that they often see their 
trusted assistant coaches get head coaching 
positions. It’s almost as if there were a family 
tree that sprouts one head coach after another 
because of the immersion in values, excellence, 
high expectation, training, and coaching. Head 
coaches such as Bill Walsh, Bill Parcells, and 
Tony Dungy have all developed numerous 
lieutenants who became head coaches them-
selves. That should be the goal of any executive 
or business owner: to develop the talent within 
and empower that talent to take on a greater 
role, increasing the overall success of the 
organization while reducing the exec’s in-the-
business time.

291
 Chapter 17: Time Management for Business Owners and Executives
 
 What are the top five time-wasters for you? Why?
 
 What are the top five time-wasters for the department/company?
 
 What are the daily or weekly time commitments that you can’t change?
 
 What are the functions and work that only you can do?
 
 Are there any tasks or activities that only one or a few individuals can do?
With the answers to these questions, you’re well-equipped to draw up a 
manifesto of the overall functioning of your area — establishing how much 
of the in work is to be performed and by whom. The goal of this process is to 
pinpoint the in work that can be removed from your plate and placed in the 
most appropriate spot.
Empowering your staff
When all decisions, both major and minor, need to be run through the execu-
tive, you end up with a tremendous waste of time. That setup does not moti-
vate the employee and bogs down the executive. The solution is to empower 
employees to identify problems and come up with solutions — in other 
words, let them do their jobs.
 
In empowering others to make decisions, you have to accept that mistakes will 
happen. Give employees the freedom to make decisions and mistakes without 
fear of recrimination. If there are some areas so critical that you can’t risk an 
error, then identify yourself as the final okay for those issues. (And hope that 
you aren’t the one who makes the mistake!)
Some people claim they can do an activity faster than it’d take them to train 
someone, so it’s not worth it. Sure, you may save time on this occasion if you 
just do the job yourself, but this outlook is only for the short term. I call this 
the incandescent blind spot: Compact fluorescent (CFL) light bulbs may cost 
twice as much as traditional incandescent bulbs today, but adding up the 
energy savings and a lifetime at least twice as long, there’s no doubt that the 
CFL bulbs are the big cost-saver. Likewise, when you train your staff to take 
on some of the in activities that hijack your time, you save in the long run. 
Now that’s a bright idea!
 
Encouragement can go a long way. Almost 20 years ago, I introduced a 
policy in my company that has dramatically reduced my in work. I call it the 
No Problems, Only Solutions Policy, and it works like this: Employees aren’t 
permitted to come to me with a problem — unless they have at least two 
solutions. Everyone from the frontline administrative assistant to the senior 
executive is held to this rule. Prior to this, I realized that I employed smart 
people but didn’t encourage them to use their problem-solving abilities. After 
I established the No Problems policy, I discovered it gave me more freedom, 

292
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
more time, and numerous teaching and coaching moments. I gained insight 
into how my employees thought. It also gave me a moment to encourage and 
further empower them.
Planning Ahead: Balancing 
Your “On” Time
On time is planning time — and it’s the most often overlooked process in 
business. That planning should have its roots in your company’s vision and 
values, which are at the core of your business success. Make sure you 
establish those visions and values with careful thought, communicate them 
to everyone on the staff, and continue to convey and instill them through 
ongoing coaching and accountability among all employees. Here are the 
major ideas you need to outline:
 
 Core purpose: Why does your company exist? And don’t say “to turn 
a profit.” Profit is the result of a well-run company that has a clearly 
defined mission. This core purpose should be easily summarized in one 
or two sentences.
 
 In my company, Sales Champions, our core purpose is “To teach and 
inspire people to use their God-given gifts to create excellence in life.” 
One of my all-time favorite core purposes is from Mary Kay Cosmetics: 
“To provide unlimited opportunity to women.” It has nothing to do with 
cosmetics — it’s about people. I believe that if Mary Kay Ash had found 
another vehicle that would provide more opportunity to women, she 
would’ve changed businesses.
 
 Core values: These are the enduring tenets that guide your mission. 
Core values should be so simple and straightforward that you could 
explain them to your children. What are the values you’d hold onto 
even if they became a competitive disadvantage? For example, at Sale 
Champions, some of our core values are “hard work and continuous self 
improvement” and “exceptional execution of the fundamentals.” Sony 
Corporation mentions “being a pioneer — not following others” and 
“doing the impossible,” and Nordstrom values “service to the customer 
above all else.” You save time by clearly knowing and living your core 
values — and having your staff know and live them as well.
 
Your core purpose and values serve as the foundation of your on responsibili-
ties: your strategy, tactics, timing, people resources, and finances. They sit at 
the heart of every action, thought, hiring, firing, strategy, tactic, and expendi-
ture. Aligning your big-picture view with your mission and values is a process 
that successful companies engage in regularly, investing at least 15 percent of 
their efforts in on activities.

293
 Chapter 17: Time Management for Business Owners and Executives
Because planning time is so important to your success, you want to be sure 
that on time gets attention. The best way to identify your on duties and 
ensure they get the necessary attention is through weekly tracking (see 
Figure 17-1 for the activity tracking chart).
Take a look at your on tasks — study them to determine their frequency, 
asking yourself questions such as the following:
 
 Do these tasks happen or need to happen every day? Every week?
 
 Is this a periodic or even one-time activity?
 
 Have you neglected some planning activities that should be on the 
weekly or daily list?
 
 Are there easy opportunities to invest more time in on activities?
 
All staff members should be investing some time during their day in on time. 
Teaching the importance of on time is the first step. If you’re leading other 
managers who get the standard of daily and weekly on time that’s presched-
uled, hold them accountable for it in your meetings. It’ll be as hard for you to 
adhere to on time as it is for them, so ask them to hold you accountable to 
your on time as well.
Setting aside daily and monthly “on” time
On time has a tendency to be squeezed out more than the other two seg-
ments for a busy owner or executive. It gets the leftovers rather than the first 
fruits of your labor. But you need on time to evaluate your previous course 
so you can plot the adjustments you need to stay on track. Use this reflection 
time to set priorities, establish goals, and revise existing processes to further 
your efforts.
At a bare minimum, I recommend at least 30 minutes at the end of the day to 
review the day— you want to get insight from your day so you can improve 
tomorrow. Ask questions like the following:
 
 What went well today?
 
 What didn’t go well today?
 
 What did you learn today?
 
 What would you have done differently?
 
 What are your priorities for tomorrow?

294
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
These questions and others like them will finish off today and set the table 
for tomorrow. I also advise that you schedule review time at the end of every 
week and month. An hour or two may be enough for an end-of-week wrap-up; 
for a month, you may need a half day.
Most people have fewer than 1,000 months in their whole lives, and you likely 
have more than a quarter of them gone as you’re reading this book. So at the 
end of a month, you need to look at how the past month stacked up. Are you 
progressing toward your goals and objectives? What are the goals and objec-
tives for the next months? What do you need your staff to focus on for the 
next 30 days? Take about a half day of on time to do a thorough evaluation of 
your month so you can invest it in the next month.
Performing a quarterly and 
yearly review of “on” time
You need to schedule quarterly and yearly reviews — wonderful predeter-
mined on time breaks — with adequate amounts of time that correspond to 
their length. Owners and executives frequently omit the quarterly pause of 
on time — it really demands a day of uninterrupted focus — but that time is 
well worth it. Here’s what to review:
 
 Where are your goals versus actual year-to-date results?
 
 What were the biggest challenges during the quarter?
 
 Has the competition changed in the quarter? Have the economic condi-
tions changed?
 
 Do you need to make any adjustments in your strategy, tactics, lead 
sources, customers, products, presentation, marketing, or staffing?
This is the time to review business plan, staff, goals, and results. You have 
enough time and data to be able to make course corrections in your business 
or department, being confident that you’re not being reactionary.
 
An off-site on day is the best strategy because it reduces distractions.
The end of the year is a time for the most thorough analysis and evaluation. 
Over the years, I’ve personally found the last week of the year to be my favor-
ite. I take the whole week to replay the year and invest the whole week in the 
on business activities. The on time of this week can ensure that the new year 
is your most productive and fruitful ever.

f you have employees who report to you, being a good time manager isn’t 
enough. For maximum benefit, your staff members also need to improve 
their time-management skills. Coaching your employees is part of your job, 
and improved time management makes everyone’s job, including yours, 
much easier.
Walking each of your staff members through this book may be the best 
solution, but most managers (even you, with your new and improved time 
management skills) probably can’t devote a block of time to a mini-seminar 
for each of your employees on the whole book. However, you may want to 
walk your people through Chapters 3 and 4 and through the appropriate 
chapters in Part V — or simply provide this book as a reference. May I say 
I’d be pleased and proud to see a copy of Successful Time Management For 
Dummies on the desk of each person in your department?
But you can do more. This chapter offers a helping hand in getting your staff 
on board as to the value of time management and in helping them embrace 
strategies and techniques for lassoing that most important of resources: their 
time. In this chapter, I show you how to take a hard look at your employees’ 
current time management practices and how to develop a growth plan that 
you all buy into. I walk you through ways to ensure that the plan sticks and 
help you support your staff’s efforts. Then I offer some strategies for handling 
situations in which an employee fails to improve.

296
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Finding Out Who’d Benefit from Training
What you accomplish is a direct result of how you use your time. Pretty 
simple, right? So how are your employees using their time? Your first step in 
getting your employees on board with time management is to find out how 
efficient they are currently and to assess their strengths and weaknesses in 
terms of time management.
You may begin by reviewing their past performance evaluations and spend-
ing time observing your staff and their work habits. Then, most importantly, 
talk to each employee, getting input about the challenges and goals in time 
management.
Using the four probabilities 
of success as a gauge
As you gather information about an employee’s time management strengths and 
weakness, you may find it helpful to consider the four probabilities of success:
 
 Knowledge
 
 Skill
 
 Attitude
 
 Activities
When you improve employee performance in any one of these areas, your 
staff becomes more productive — and the individuals on your team become 
more successful.
Knowledge of time management principles
A strong knowledge of proven time management principles can increase the 
volume of work your staff can complete in an eight-hour day. Additionally, 
employees need to have a solid knowledge of their job and the responsibili-
ties expected of them. When evaluating an individual’s time management 
potential based on knowledge, answer the following questions — based on 
your observations:
 
 Does the employee have the knowledge necessary to do his or her job in 
an efficient manner?
 
 How well-defined are this employee’s life and business goals?
 
 Is the individual aware that time management is an important priority?
 
 Are the business goals yours or the employee’s?

297
 Chapter 18: Coaching Others to Manage Time Effectively
 
 Does the employee know how to work effectively to meet time goals?
 
 Do you talk about goals frequently and specifically enough?
 
 Does the employee understand the 80/20 rule: that 20 percent of effort 
brings about 80 percent of results? (See Chapter 4 for more on the 
80/20 rule.)
Skill in time management techniques
Skilled time managers usually acquire their expertise through practice, 
trial-and-error, and daily use of techniques (as well as a few failures). 
Your staff has to develop time management expertise in the same way.
Employees who have time-related skills — such as the ability to organize 
themselves and their work area and use tools such as day planners and 
organizers — are likely more efficient. Look at your staff and ask the following 
questions:
 
 Is the employee able to use organizational techniques and tools, 
including technology?
 
 Does the individual’s work area seem organized and tidy?
 
 Do you notice that the person has difficulty diverting interruptions? 
 
 Does the employee prioritize each day for the next before leaving for 
home?
 
 Have you noticed whether the employee regularly uses a planning 
system to track upcoming commitments or even the next day’s work? 
Does he or she do this every evening or only once in a while?
 
 Is the staffer able to use a scheduling system to organize his or her day?
 
 Is the employee able to consistently keep commitments — including 
arriving at work and making it to meetings on time?
Attitude toward improving time management
Attitude is one of the most important factors in success. Maintaining a posi-
tive attitude is a choice, however, and it’s one you have a right to expect 
your employees to make. A poor attitude leads to negative results and — 
you guessed it — more wasted time. Even if skills and knowledge are on the 
weaker side, a good attitude makes for faster and greater improvement in 
time management skills. As you study your employees, ask these questions to 
determine their attitude toward time management:
 
 Is the employee open to learning new techniques and skills to increase 
productivity?
 
 Has the individual proactively sought out advice or made efforts to 
improve time management practices?

298
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 Has the staffer exhibited a positive attitude in other situations in which 
improvement was needed?
 
 Does the employee convey confidence that he or she is able to develop 
more time-efficient habits?
Activities
In the business world, action is king. The biggest increase in productivity 
comes from selecting the right activities on which to spend your time. In 
Chapters 15, 16, and 17, I outline areas in which administrative employees, 
salespeople, and executives have to spend their time to produce better 
results more efficiently. As you evaluate your employees’ activities, you may 
include these questions:
 
 In which activities does the person spend his or her time?
 
 How does the employee’s eight-hour day break down? What percentage 
of his or her time is spent on each of these activities?
 
 Does the staffer avoid or postpone activities he or she doesn’t like?
 
 What activities is the individual most comfortable doing? Are those 
activities best for the department and the company?
 
 Does the employee accept direction in terms of prioritization of activities?
Tapping into an employee’s motivation
 
One critical key to success in helping an employee manage time is to involve 
the individual, so be sure one of the first steps you take is to confirm 
employee buy-in. You want to put together a plan in which the employee has 
as much ownership as you do, and that means involving him or her at the 
outset.
You can’t afford not to pass along time management tips to your employees. I 
liken true coaching to exercise: It may seem inconvenient and time-consuming, 
and sometimes it is, but the benefits so far outweigh the effort that it’s impos-
sible to justify skipping it.
If you’re like most managers, you may find that training your employees in 
time management helps you improve your own time management skills fur-
ther. Teaching others is the best way to reinforce your knowledge and dis-
cover even more about a topic.
 
Don’t neglect the costs of employees who work excessively. Some people feel 
that how many hours they work in a week is a badge of honor. This warped 
thought process leads to excessive time at the job, which can lead to burnout, 
lower production, and lower levels of job satisfaction. If the employee isn’t 
salaried, then overtime costs are significant to companies as well.

299
 Chapter 18: Coaching Others to Manage Time Effectively
Discerning whether your employee is ready to change
My experience coaching hundreds of people worldwide has taught me that 
most people don’t change their time management (or any other) strategy 
unless they’re experiencing some type of pain: They’ve had enough, heard 
enough, or hurt enough:
 
 Had enough: They’re frustrated and feel like they’re always at work. 
They’ve missed enough dinners with family, T-ball games, swimming 
lessons, kindergarten graduations, and nights out to say, “I’m going to 
make a change.” This one is the best of the three options because it’s 
created internally, so it has greater odds of sticking. The employee may 
come to you for guidance.
 
 Heard enough: When a staffer reaches the “had enough” level but still 
presses on, ignoring repeated warnings in various forms, it may be time 
for the manager (that’s you) to step in and have some serious discus-
sions with him or her. Using this book, as well as stories of your victo-
ries and failures in time management, can bring the situation to light.
 
 I’m not suggesting nagging as a strategy to improve an employee’s time 
management; I am suggesting that repetition and consistency of message 
have their place.
 
 Hurt enough: As a manager, friend, and colleague, “hurt enough” is the 
learning experience you want employees to avoid. An employee comes 
home one day and the kids and spouse are gone because he or she was 
never home. Or employee health issues border on catastrophic because 
he or she never “had time” to attend to his or her physical well-being.
Spend some time talking to the employee and you’re bound to discover 
whether he or she has reached — or is close to — one of these crossroads. 
Then you want to try to connect with the person on an emotional level.
Helping your employee want to change
Most human beings make decisions — even big decisions — largely based 
on emotions. Then they justify those decisions with logic, data, or facts. 
Achieving buy-in from employees isn’t solely about goals, benefits, and time 
management skills. It’s also about employees’ emotions.
Tapping into your employees’ feelings can help you persuade them to try 
your new time management strategies. Try these questions to explore their 
emotions regarding time management:
 
 “How do you feel when you miss your quota for the month?”
 
 “How do you feel when you’re interrupted regularly by others?”
 
 “What are your feelings when I delegate a few projects in a row?”
Next, use follow-up questions to move from emotions to action:

300
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 “How can I help you reduce those feelings? How can you reduce them?”
 
 “What can I do to help you feel more positive and energized rather than 
drained and frustrated? What can you do?”
The answers — or emotions — your questions elicit help prompt your 
employee to buy into a plan for improved time management. Tell your employ-
ees that based on their responses, you’d like to work with them to develop a 
time management plan with concrete steps they can take to improve their skills.
Establishing Goals
As soon as you understand a staff member’s problem areas, the next step is 
to develop a plan to overcome these challenges and turn the employee into a 
productive, efficient dynamo. One of the first items on your agenda when you 
want to overhaul employees’ time-management skills is to establish goals. As 
you craft the goals, you may want to turn back to Chapter 2 for more advice.
 
When establishing an employee’s time management goals, keep these pointers 
in mind:
 
 Cast the goals in a positive light. Instead of “stop coming in late,” try 
“work to consistently come in on time or earlier.”
 
 Make goals realistic. Goals should be challenging but not so difficult 
that the employee may become discouraged. If an employee is always 
late for work, insisting on 100-percent on-time arrival starting on day one 
may be setting the bar too high.
 
 Break goals into manageable steps when possible. What steps does 
your employee need to take to accomplish the goals? For instance, you 
may have your employee identify his most important tasks before trying 
to put them in order.
 
 Make goals measurable. First, determine how you can measure the 
progress:
 
• By projects completed?
 
• By an increase in responsibility?
 
• By adherence to new time management strategies and systems? 
 
• By a rating system you develop?
 
 Then make sure you can measure the goals using numbers, whether per-
centages, totals, number of first-time responsibilities, or specific figures. 
With a measureable component, a goal such as “finish projects on time” 
becomes “strive to increase on-time completion of projects from 1 in 5 
to 4 in 5” or “commit to completing all projects within 24 hours of the 
original deadline.”

301
 Chapter 18: Coaching Others to Manage Time Effectively
 
 Give a target date for goals. Without establishing a “by” date, your 
employees are less likely to be as motivated to do the hard work of 
change. To make sure the time line you attach to the goal is realistic, 
ask these questions:
 
• When do you want to see improvement? Next week? Next month? 
Next quarter?
 
• When is the employee’s next performance review? Is it reasonable 
to expect X amount of improvement by that time?
 
• Are there company deadlines that have an impact on how quickly 
improvements need to be made?
 
 With a target date, “reduce the number of interruptions to four times per 
morning” becomes “reduce the number of interruptions to four times 
per morning by month’s end.”
 
Have your employees develop skills time lines, which determine which skills, 
tools, or systems they must learn and implement and by what dates. Help 
your employees create their time lines, but let them do the bulk of the work 
themselves: It builds employees’ ownership of the goals, and it teaches them 
the skill so they can do it themselves the next time.
Incorporating Tools and Strategies
Chances are your employees could use some tools, technology, and 
resources to assist with the process of adopting new time management skills. 
As you put together your plan, select the tools you believe are most pertinent 
and work them into your overall strategy. Of course, all the content in this 
book is of great value, but here are some helpful tools and strategies your 
employees can use to address common time-management challenges:
 
 Find where the time goes with time-tracking charts. Plenty of people 
have difficulty identifying where their time goes. Your employees 
who struggle with productivity probably believe they’re getting a lot 
done, when in all likelihood their days are peppered with disruption, 
drained from wasteful meetings, and dissolved by unimportant but 
time-consuming tasks.
 
 A time-tracking chart commands users to look closely at their day, half-
hour by half-hour. This tool is sure to unearth the worst time-stealing cul-
prits, and the discovery of “where the time goes” is likely to liberate the 
employee into a more productive state of being.
 
 Identify what comes first with the prioritization tool. Some employees 
struggle with determining what’s really important — which projects 
are most critical to address or which job to tackle first every day. What 
these folks need is a way to help them order their priorities. The priori-
tization tool spelled out in Chapter 4 helps individuals gather all their 

302
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
projects or tasks and go through a careful and deliberative process to 
put them in order. This is a process that you and the employee may 
want to work through together because work priorities are a combina-
tion of personal and business interests.
 
 Get a grip on the day/week/month with time-blocking. Who doesn’t get 
so overwhelmed by a busy schedule that he or she misses an important 
meeting, forgets about a family event, or double-books appointments? The 
person who uses the time-blocking tool! By introducing your employees 
to time-blocking (see Chapter 4), you help them open the door to achiev-
ing so much more. Because time-blocking brings in all aspects of your life, 
from work to personal, those who use it often discover that they don’t 
have to sacrifice family for work — or vice versa.
 
 Head off drag time with the 11 a.m. rule. As you direct your employees 
to block their time, arm them with the 11 a.m. rule, scheduling the most 
important tasks of the day before 11 a.m. For most people, the hours 
before 11 a.m. are most productive. Workers tend to have more energy 
at the beginning of the day and, typically, there are fewer interruptions, 
problems, and “fires” to serve as distractions. When your employees 
tackle the most important tasks during their peak performance period, 
they’re investing their best hours in the most critical activities before 
the day wears them down.
 
 Combat interruptions with do-not-disturb policies. All employees strug-
gle with interruptions, but administrative staff are especially vulnerable. 
You may want to institute a time during the day when administrative 
employees are relieved of phone duties and other potential distractions 
(if you have more than one administrative assistant, rotate schedules so 
they’re not all using their quiet time at once).
 
 If a staff member has his or her own office, suggest that he or she shut 
the door, essentially hanging up a do-not-disturb sign. You can also have 
employees hang actual do-not-disturb signs if they work in a bullpen 
environment or cubicle. Help communicate their off-limits time to other 
staff members so they can be more productive.
 
 Encourage employees to make the most of these time periods — 
somewhere between 60 to 90 minutes at a time — saving that time 
for the projects and tasks that require concentrated effort or intense 
focus, such as writing a report or doing research.
 
As you and your employee develop the plan for more effective time manage-
ment, start small and then build on that. By starting small, you encounter less 
resistance. Employees won’t roll their eyes when they see you coming, know-
ing you’re on this “new time management kick.” And they won’t secretly hope 
it all blows over so they can return to status quo in a few weeks. Instead of 
pressing the employee to commit to doubling productivity, begin by getting 
the individual to incorporate time-blocking or reducing daily interruptions 
into his or her daily routine. Focus on one small tool, strategy, or routine for 
a few weeks.

 Chapter 18: Coaching Others to Manage Time Effectively
Fostering Partnership and 
Encouraging Success
I’m a big productivity and efficiency nut. I want the best possible value out of 
every second in life. When I was younger and attended conferences or read 
books, I came away with 101 new ideas on how my companies could operate 
with higher returns. I wanted to implement them all by yesterday.
My staff members started wincing when I brought my new ideas to the office, 
and they especially dreaded my return from conferences because I could 
point to XYZ Company, which was doing business this way and was hugely 
successful. I had validated results! But I can tell you, I didn’t generate buy-in 
when I came back.
Time management is an evolving process. Acquiring new skills, making notice-
able improvements, and completing complex projects are big steps. That 
means they take time, which means greater potential for an employee to veer 
off-course. You can’t meet with the employee, set up the plan, and walk away, 
expecting everything to work. The employee is accountable for achieving these 
benchmarks, but you, as manager, have accountability, too. You have to nur-
ture the process along the way. In this section, I explain how to approach the 
time-management plan as a partnership between you and the employee.
Setting up benchmarks and 
check-ins to instill accountability
As for accountability and performance change, two universal truths stand out:
 
 When performance is measured, performance improves.
 
 When performance is measured and reported, performance improves faster.
So as you put together the improvement plan, define benchmarks — progress 
stops along the way to the time management goals (see the earlier “Establishing 
Goals” section) — and set check-in appointments in which you and the staffer 
meet to assess progress.
Check-ins with your employee may be frequent at first and become less frequent 
as time passes. You may schedule daily check-ins in the beginning, moving to 
weekly, biweekly, and monthly progress reports as the employee builds his or 
her time management skills and achieves greater confidence. As you schedule 
the progress report points, determine the following:

304
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
 
 Whether employees need to hand in their measurement and tracking 
tools daily, weekly, or monthly; I have my employees hand in daily 
reports that track their activities by the half hour and show how they 
prioritize their tasks and projects
 
 Whether you’ll meet face-to-face daily, weekly, or monthly to discuss 
employees’ progress
 
If you can, schedule weekly or at least regular sessions with an employee, 
each session lasting at least a half hour. In addition to checking the bench-
mark status and getting an update from the staffer, you can introduce a new 
time management technique. These sessions can help you keep tabs on the 
individual’s progress and inspire the employee to stick with the effort.
 
Employees want to see improvement fast, or they may begin to think this time 
management stuff is a bunch of bunk. So come up with some measurable and 
reasonable benchmarks that are certain to motivate the staffer to progress.
Being consistent
 
If you delve into successful time-management strategies, you find that consis-
tency is the secret sauce of success. As a manager looking to groom your staff 
into better time managers, consistency is important both in terms of what you 
should expect from your employees and what they should expect from you.
Model the behaviors you’d like employees to exhibit. Establish routines and 
then help employees develop their own routines. As you keep tabs on an 
employee’s progress toward better time management, be consistent with the 
following:
Taking a team-based approach to time management
If you feel uncomfortable engaging so person-
ally in the lives of your team members, consider 
a group goal-setting session limited to business 
topics. Take your team off-site for an afternoon 
or, even better, a full day. Discuss departmen-
tal objectives, quotas, and benchmarks. Ask for 
input on goals, strategies to attain them, and 
bottlenecks where time is wasted or service 
doesn’t meet the standard.
Set goals as a group and make sure everyone 
commits to them as a team. Then determine a 
team reward that energizes employees. Make 
it clear the reward is available to everyone who 
works toward it. The reward needs to be their 
idea: their reward and their commitment to 
deliver with excellence.
You may establish weekly time management 
classes to raise awareness as well as skill 
levels, but make sure employees green-light 
the idea before you begin, or your results may 
be less than stellar.

 Employees’ schedules
 
 Strategies for minimizing interruptions
 
 Meetings and appointments
 
 Memos
 
 Time-block schedules
 
 Priorities
 
 Expectations
When your staff members are confident that the priorities you set for them 
yesterday won’t turn on end today, and when they can look to you as a 
manager who consistently makes appointments and meetings on time and 
responds promptly, they’re more likely to embrace their time management 
goals and improve their performance.
Fulfilling your role as a mirror
As your employees’ manager and coach, you’re in the mirror business. Ask 
employees to articulate their goals and then serve as a mirror to show them 
how what they do daily reflects what they claim they want. When you mirror 
an employee’s vision — rather than your own expectations — you’re more 
likely to motivate positively. Consider these two statements:
“You’re not going to do a good job on this project if you’re getting distracted 
by other things.”
“You shared with me that this project was extremely important to you. How 
do you see yourself completing it while directing most of your energy to 
these other tasks?”
The first casts the goal as yours — not the employee’s — and your feedback 
comes off as a reprimand. But when mirroring the employee’s interests, as 
the second statement does, you come across as an ally in your employee’s 
success.
Here are some effective mirroring phrases:
 
 “You said you wanted to invest x hours a week in this activity. How are you 
doing so far? What do you need to do to improve that? What can I do to 
help you?”
 
 “What changes are in order to allow you to achieve those goals you told 
me about?”
 
 “Can I hold you accountable for meeting your goal?”

306
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
The more clearly you see employees’ goals, the more effectively you can 
remind them of their goals and reinforce that how they manage their time 
helps them achieve their goals.
Dealing with a Lack of Progress: Can 
This Employee Be Saved?
When you make a commitment to help an employee improve, you invest time 
of your own and you understandably don’t want to give up, even if things 
don’t appear to be progressing. Unfortunately, not everybody can be saved. 
Sometimes, even though you follow all the steps I outline to help your staff 
members attain time-management enlightenment, you can’t get through. In 
these circumstances, you may have to take a good, hard look at the situation 
and make some tough decisions.
 
If you’re committed to healing your problem employee no matter what, be 
careful. Early in my sales management career, I was determined to make a 
particular salesperson better. I vowed that I’d make him into a good salesper-
son, even if it killed me. It almost did! I worried more about this salesperson 
and lost more sleep over him than any other I’ve had in my career. It was a big 
waste of time and energy because I was really more determined to make him a 
success than he was.
Waiting for the “Aha!”
I once had a salesperson who struggled with a 
number of key issues but especially with invest-
ing too much time in unqualified prospects. He 
wanted to save these people, but he couldn’t 
help them because his prospects hadn’t arrived 
at a point where they wanted to change — and 
not changing didn’t hurt them enough.
The salesperson called me and asked what 
to do with a prospect he hadn’t closed. After 
listening to his story, I knew the prospect 
wouldn’t be converted to a customer because 
he didn’t meet the criteria for Sales Champions’ 
prospects. I asked the salesperson a few ques-
tions, and suddenly, the conversation changed. 
My salesperson took the lead, telling me why 
he should abandon this prospect and move on, 
even though he’d invested hours in moving the 
prospect toward a sale.
I asked myself, “Has he finally gotten it? Did 
he just put the puzzle together?” Before he 
hung up, he said, “Dirk, I get it!” That was the 
moment I’d been waiting for: the got-it moment. 
All the sweat, worry, and frustration had been 
worth it.

307
 Chapter 18: Coaching Others to Manage Time Effectively
Before you invest the time in trying to save an employee, determine whether 
this is a problem that can’t be fixed. Look for these signs:
 
 The employee has consistently failed to meet time management bench-
marks and goals established in your plan.
 
 The employee has failed to use the time management tools you identified 
in the plan.
 
 The employee is neglecting opportunities to acquire knowledge or skills 
that could help him or her attain time management goals.
 
 The employee has displayed a negative attitude despite your efforts to 
connect time management improvement to his or her goals.
 
 The employee’s time management failures are having a measurable 
impact on your department or company goals. (Consider measurements 
such as revenue shortfall or missed deadlines.)
 
 The employee’s limitations are having a detrimental effect on other staff.
If your employee meets even one of these criteria, you, as a manager, need to 
take action. Here are your options.
Accepting them, warts and all
If you’re like most managers, you probably have at least one employee whose 
use of time makes you bite your lip (and your tongue). Despite your efforts 
and encouragement, you haven’t seen any improvement. But because of other 
merits or strengths that the employee brings to the company, you may choose 
to let it go. Say, for example, the staffer is a prolific producer of business and 
meets all responsibilities, but simply can’t manage her own time and often 
spends evenings and weekends in the office. Because her challenges don’t 
affect her performance or disrupt anyone else in your department, you may be 
comfortable resigning yourself to this failing.
 
When evaluating this employee, address and document this shortcoming 
during the annual review. Your staff members need to be held accountable for 
their ability — or inability — to meet the goals you’ve set for them.
Giving it one more try
The original time-management improvement plan you mapped out with the 
employee should have had some give built into it. For example, the bench-
marks you set may have allowed for extra time if the employee struggled a bit 
achieving that point. But if you want to give the employee one more chance, 
have at it: Be prepared to go through the discussion, review, and perhaps 
revision of the improvement plan, identifying tools and setting up a time line. 

308
Part V: Advanced Time Management for Specific Folks 
Maybe your problem employee only needs fine tuning. Answer these questions:
 
 What adjustment in the employee’s time management process would 
improve his or her performance?
 
 What skill, if he or she mastered it, would make this employee more 
productive?
 
 How can you help this employee increase his or her earnings?
 
 What would have to happen to allow this employee to leave work at 5 
p.m. rather than 6:30 p.m. each night?
 
I suggest, at this juncture, that you tighten up the time frame for improvement. 
Suppose you originally had an overall time line of six months, with interim 
benchmarks every two weeks. This go-round, establish the expectation that 
the goals must be met within two or three months. After all, with all the time 
you’ve already invested in this employee, it’s reasonable to expect results a lot 
earlier. In addition, be sure to clarify the consequences should the employee 
fail to improve at the end of this time.
Saying sayonara
One of my mentors, Dave Doeleman, taught me, “If you can’t change people, 
you have to change people.” Time management skills are critical to the suc-
cess of an individual and to the team. If you have an employee whose failure 
to meet time management goals is affecting the success of your area, and 
if you’ve done everything you can (as outlined in this chapter) to help the 
employee attain time management skills, then you may find yourself obliged 
to let the individual go and replace him or her with someone who has his or 
her time under control — or who shows promise of developing the skills.

In This Chapter
 Changing your approach to tasks
 Cutting out clutter
 Increasing your optimism
W
ith all the things you have to accomplish in a given day, wouldn’t 
it be nice if the day were just a bit longer? Before you start thinking 
of ways to slow the rotation of the Earth, try to cut out some serious 
time-wasters — or at least reduce the amount of time you devote to them; 
it’ll seem like you’re gaining one, two, three, or even more hours to your 
day to invest in activities and pursuits that are important to you. Here are 
some of the most voracious devourers of your precious time.
Failing to Stop and Think
When you spend too little time in preparation, you’re forced to spend too 
much time in execution. The time you invest in collecting, compiling, and 
organizing your thoughts before you begin a project pays off in time savings 
and in the quality of the outcome.
Not only does planning ahead eliminate problems before you start, but it 
also helps you imagine how you’ll perform the task. When you address 
the situation in advance, you feed your subconscious with the tools and 
information it needs to work on the problems, often without your awareness. 
That’s kind of like sticking bread dough in a warm space and letting it rise 
overnight — just consider your planning efforts to be the yeast that brings 
your projects to rise to their full potential.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Preparation is valuable in efforts big and small. Even 10 minutes at the end of 
a day to review your schedule and set out the materials you’ll need is sure to 
increase your productivity and effectiveness the next day.
Multitasking
The scientific evidence overwhelmingly suggests that multitasking — 
switching back and forth between two or more tasks — is an extremely 
ineffective way to get things done. Researchers say that when you multitask, 
you’re making your brain take time to switch to a different skill set and a 
different memory experience.
One study shows that when people who speak two languages are asked to 
switch between languages when counting objects, they have to slow down for 
each switch — even the language they’re most familiar with. Another study 
indicates that when people start-stop on several tasks in a given time period, 
they increase the time needed for completion by as much as 500 percent.
Sometimes multitasking can’t be helped: You’re cooking dinner, helping one 
child with her homework, and telling another where he can find his soccer 
shoes. And sometimes multitasking doesn’t affect productivity: You’re 
reading a book while listening to jazz and stopping occasionally to respond 
to your spouse who’s reading next to you.
 
For those projects and tasks that require your best effort, you’re better 
off to focus on one at a time. Here’s how to keep yourself focused on the task 
at hand:
 
 Turn off your cellphone or the ringer on your land line, or forward 
your phone to go directly to voice mail. Even if you intend not to 
answer the call, the sound halts your attention and slows your progress.
 
 If working on the computer, set your e-mail program so you’re not 
notified every time you receive a new message. You may check your 
e-mail at certain time intervals or even arrange to check and respond to 
e-mail in your time-block schedule. Turn to Chapter 4 for more about 
time-blocking.
 
 If you’re working on a report, article, or some project that demands a 
lot of concentration, set aside at least one hour of uninterrupted time. 
You may not be able to finish it in that hour, but you’ll get a good jump 
on it. An hour of focus is about all most people can do on an intense 
project without some type of break to get a cup of coffee or visit the 
restroom or just do a stretch.
See Chapter 9 for tips on handling interruptions.

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Time-Wasting Behaviors
Working without Breaks
There’s a point of diminishing return where your focus and concentration 
start to fall dramatically. Too many people grind through, skip breaks, and 
cross that threshold. They sit and read the same paragraph over and over 
again because they’re tired and out of focus. They review the same report 
again without realizing it until they’re halfway through it.
 
Everyone needs breaks from routine and the tasks at hand. You should take 
frequent breaks but for very short durations. If you’re given two 15-minute 
breaks a day plus your lunch hour, I suggest trying to take three 10-minute 
breaks or two 5-minute breaks and two 10-minute breaks for the day. I’m not 
suggesting taking more time than you’re allowed by your boss, but to use it in 
short spurts to regain your focus and energy.
Demanding Perfection
If you’re expecting perfection out of yourself or others, you’re wasting your 
time. Letting imperfection keep you from pursuing recreational interests or 
your career goals can end up limiting your fulfillment in life.
The amount of time, effort, energy, and emotion required to achieve perfec-
tion dramatically reduce production. You may invest as much time and 
energy to move from a 95 percent performance score to the 100 percent mark 
as you do to go from 0 to 95 percent. You’re much better off investing your 
energy in starting something new than focusing on perfection.
And if you refuse to give it a go until you’re perfect, how will you ever get to 
be perfect? One of history’s most prolific inventors, Thomas Edison, made 
hundreds of failed prototypes before he perfected inventions such as the 
light bulb.
Worrying and Waiting
Hand-in-hand, worry and waiting are two time-wasters that can undermine 
your success and happiness in life. Worry usually comes from dwelling on 
factors that you can’t control. It’s scary to think about overpowering forces 
that can have a devastating impact: a downturn in the economy, a hurricane, 
global warming. But if you spend time worrying, you’re not spending time 
on ways you can prepare or avoid such forces. Renowned self-help guru 
Dale Carnegie viewed it this way: “If you can’t sleep, then get up and do some-
thing instead of lying there worrying. It’s the worry that gets you, not the lack 
of sleep.”

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Another exercise to help you overcome worry is to ask yourself these four 
questions:
 
 What am I really worrying about?
 
 What can I do about it?
 
 What will I do about it?
 
 When will I take action?
A first cousin to worry is waiting — not the waiting for your spouse to meet 
you for dinner. Or the waiting to hear back from a client about your proposal. 
Or the waiting for the price on HDTV to go down. I’m talking about the 
waiting that often accompanies worry, the waiting that keeps you from taking 
a productive course of action.
Why not know now rather than later? If that client hasn’t called you back, call 
her. You’re going to find out the answer, anyway. If she gives you the bad 
news that you lost the competition for the business, find out now so you can 
do something about it or replace the business by prospecting. If you’re wait-
ing for the price of a TV to go down, how much do you really expect it to fall? 
Is enjoying it for a few months in your home worth a couple hundred dollars?
Hooking Up to the Tube
According to the Nielsen Company, the average person in the United States 
watches more than 28 hours of TV a week. Think about it: If you could 
eliminate that much viewing time, it’d be like having an eight-day week. Just 
think of all you could do with 28 extra hours: read a good book, spend time 
with your family, take a class, start working out — and even get a good 
night’s sleep!
If you’re a committed TV watcher, kicking the habit cold turkey probably 
isn’t realistic. The withdrawal pains would be too severe. And truth is, televi-
sion isn’t all bad. Just like coffee, a little bit can do you some good. But to me, 
28 hours of TV a week is the equivalent of a four-cup-a-day espresso habit.
 
Here are some ways to wean yourself off evenings and weekends glued to 
the couch:
 
 Leave the TV off if you’re not watching it. Some folks like to have the 
tube on for company, but it’s too tempting to wander over and plop 
yourself down if Oprah is hosting a controversial guest or the tribe is 
about to cast another member off the island.

315
 Chapter 19: Ten Time-Wasting Behaviors
 
 Preplan your TV schedule. Decide what’s really important for you to 
watch. On Tuesday evening, if it’s the 9 p.m. crime investigation 
series, so be it. But don’t turn on the TV until it starts, and turn it off 
immediately upon seeing the closing credits.
 
 Schedule no-watch zones throughout your week. Maybe set aside a 
specific weeknight or weekend day when all household TVs remain off.
 
 Reduce the number of TVs in your home. Keep the TV out of the 
kitchen and bedroom, especially. Just as diet experts advise weight 
watchers to eat only in certain places in their houses, limiting the 
number of TVs helps keep the habit under control.
 
 Prerecord what you want to watch and view it on your own schedule. 
The added bonus? You get to skip over all the commercials, which 
reduces your viewing time by about one-third!
Surfing the Web
Nothing is wrong with hanging ten on the Internet — as long as the ten isn’t 
ten hours. I’m not exaggerating when I report that although studies indicate 
the average per-day time online is one or two hours, a measurable percent-
age spend seven or more hours a day glued to their monitors! Studies also 
show that Internet time is increasing — and usurping other activities, includ-
ing watching TV and reading.
The Internet is incredibly valuable as a time-saving tool. Just think how much 
faster pulling data and tracking down information is than in the past. But 
the Web is a storehouse of useless information as well. You can spend hours 
sifting through waves of data in search of what you really want to know, and 
before you know it, more than half the day has passed. Your original inten-
tions suffer a wipeout as you get pulled off-course by information undertow.
When using the Internet for research or information-gathering, it pays to stay 
focused on your mission: What are you in search of? The annual report from 
a company you’re pursuing as a client? The best bed-and-breakfasts available 
in St. Thomas in May? Don’t get sidetracked by related information that 
steers you off-course. Put specific phrases in quotation marks to get exact 
matches or use the advanced search features to avoid certain words or limit 
your search to .org, .com, .gov, or .edu sites as needed. Bookmark sites 
you find especially useful, or copy and paste important info into a separate 
document, along with the URL where you found it, for later reference.

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
A big use of the Internet is for recreational pursuits: music, shopping, com-
puter games, blogs, virtual worlds, porn. My advice: In some cases, you’re 
best to cut off this activity completely. Many of these online behaviors can 
lead to serious problems, addictions, financial risk, and even personal safety 
issues. In other more benign situations, it’s still a good idea to keep the online 
activity to a minimum and find your kicks in the real world instead.
Getting Caught in Junk Mail Undertow
As if it weren’t enough to be inundated with credit card offers, catalogs, and 
direct marketing materials in your mailboxes, now your e-mail in-boxes are 
slammed with unsolicited tidings, commonly known as spam. At least e-mail 
offerings don’t waste the thousands and thousands of tons of paper that gets 
tossed in the recycling bin. But everyone wastes too much time sifting 
through both paper and electronic mail to make sure they don’t miss critical 
correspondence.
 
Recently at our house, I collected a month’s worth of junk mail, which 
included 30 catalogs addressed to Joan. Interesting thing: She had only ever 
ordered from two of the catalogs. Apparently, these catalog companies sold 
her name to the other merchants.
Selling or exchanging mailing lists is a common practice among catalog 
companies. I bet if you check in the stack of offers you receive, you’ll find a 
few different companies that misspell your name in exactly the same way. 
Coincidence? I don’t think so.
Getting off all these lists is more of a challenge than it ought to be. Calling the 
company and asking to be taken off its list doesn’t always work. And after you 
do get off a list, the same company may purchase a new list with your name 
on it, and the mail starts up again. Although many companies commit to 
purging your name from future purchased lists, this just doesn’t always 
happen.
 
You can take some steps to reduce the deluge of paper and electronic mail 
that comes your way. However, it does take a little bit of a time investment to 
stop this time-waster:
 
 Register with www.dmachoice.org to be removed from direct-mail 
lists for up to three years.
 
 Go to www.optoutprescreen.com to get off mailing lists for 
prescreened credit and insurance offers.

317
 Chapter 19: Ten Time-Wasting Behaviors
 
 To reduce your catalog load, sign up with www.catalogchoice.org. 
You can manage your mail by selecting which catalogs you’d like to 
continue to receive and which you don’t.
 
 Online, install a good spam manager program. Most capture the spam 
mail and offer you the opportunity to view it if you like.
Be prepared: It can take as long as ten weeks to see a reduction in your 
junk snail mail. Also, be sure to enter the names of all the people in your 
household — as well as variations of your name and address. Joan was 
actually receiving two catalogs from one fashion company: one to Joan Zeller 
and one to Joan Seller.
Killing Time in Transit
I used to envy those folks living in major metropolitan areas who could take 
advantage of efficient mass transportation. With the idea of hopping on a 
train and spending the commute reading, catching up on reports, and sched-
uling business commitments while leaving the driving to others, I wouldn’t 
care if the commute were an hour!
That was an unrealistic fantasy, of course — my job required lots of driving 
to places not well-served by public transportation. That meant long, unpro-
ductive hours behind the wheel. Unproductive, that is, until I discovered that 
my automobile provided me with one of the most valuable opportunities I 
could’ve imagined. My vehicle became my very own auto-university.
At the time I turned to the cassette player — now it’s a CD player — and turned 
my vehicle into a classroom for skills development and self-improvement. 
Instead of listening to commercial radio, switching stations as I drove out of 
signal, I put my ears to work listening to motivational speakers and how-to 
books on everything from personal finance to personal relationships.
 
I recommend some of my favorite audio programs from over the years: Jim 
Rohn’s The Art of Exceptional Living, Earl Nightingale’s Lead the Field, Brian 
Tracy’s The Psychology of Achievement, and Goals, by my good friend Zig 
Ziglar. I also recommend some of my own CD programs, which you can find at 
www.saleschampions.com or www.dirkzeller.com.
Although there’s nothing wrong with listening to music or radio talk shows 
(one of my very best friends owns a number of radio stations), when you 
spend a lot of time in your car, you’re better served by putting some of that 
time to good use.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Spending Time with Negative People
One way to bring down your energy level, reduce your enthusiasm, darken 
your outlook, slow your productivity, and drain your glass from half-full to 
almost-empty is to invest your time in negative people. The more you reduce 
the influence they have on your life, the happier and more productive you 
can be.
Easier said than done, I know. Chances are you have at least one foul-weather 
friend in your close circle. And you’re likely related to someone who likes 
to remind you that you’re not living up to your potential or that everyone 
is out to trip you up. Your negative associates don’t necessarily focus their 
malcontent mojo toward you. They may, in fact, look at you as a shining 
success while they cast themselves as a poor victim of the world’s injustices. 
But their pessimism is bound to rub off on you.
I don’t suggest that you abandon friends and relatives who are suffering 
through hard times, whether due to illness, financial problems, or personal 
troubles. I’m talking about avoiding those people who are prone to see the 
negative side of life, no matter how much good fortune they have.
Do your best to minimize the time you spend in the company of curmud-
geons and contrarians. Not only do you take back valuable time to direct 
toward positive endeavors, but their absence also breaks the dark spell over 
your optimistic outlook.

management is a matter of habit. And in this chapter, I present you with the 
ten best habits to adopt for winning at time efficiency.
Start Your Day Early
Most people are more productive in the morning. That’s logical: After sleep, 
you have more energy, you’re more alert, and you’ve had less “day,” when 
everything that could go wrong does. No doubt, a half-hour first thing in the 
morning is easily worth two hours at the end of the day.
When I have deadlines to hit and projects to complete, I set my alarm clock 
for a couple of hours earlier than normal. That’s much more effective for me 
than trying to squeeze in the time in the evening. I’m generally too tired to 
focus well. I may go to bed as early as 8:00 p.m. in order to get up at 3:00 a.m. 
to put in some dedicated time. The house is quiet. I’m refreshed. My mind is 
alert. And my productivity is at its peak.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
You don’t have to set your alarm for the crack of dawn. An extra hour can 
buy you plenty of bonus time to take a big bite off your to-do list. Even 
just a half-hour earlier a day adds 182.5 hours to your year — 23 additional 
workdays:
365 days × 1/2 hour ÷ 8-hour workday  22.8 workdays
It really is the closest thing to buying more time.
Plan for the Next Day
Set aside time every day, at the end of the workday or before you wind down 
in the evening, to set up for the next day. Investing a half-hour, even as little 
as 10 or 15 minutes, can guarantee a higher return on productivity in as little 
as 24 hours.
As you confirm tomorrow’s schedule and add to your to-do list, take your 
entire day into account — not just your work hours but your personal 
obligations, too. Think through all that you hope to accomplish, from the 
time the alarm clock goes off (need to take the cat to the vet or pick up dry 
cleaning?) through your workday (what meetings and presentations are 
scheduled?) and through the hours you have before your day concludes 
(time to return some phone calls to family and friends?). Then adjust your 
schedule accordingly.
As you set aside some uninterrupted planning time, do the following:
 
 Review tomorrow’s work commitments and be sure your schedule 
is up-to-date.
 
 Integrate any personal appointments into your schedule, too.
 
 Make sure you have no scheduling conflicts. (Does your morning 
meeting allow you to get to your noon dentist appointment on time?)
 
 Add any items you didn’t get to today.
 
 Anticipate and work in any plans or arrangements necessary for 
accomplishing tomorrow’s to-dos.
 
 Identify your top priorities — if everything that could go wrong does, 
what do you absolutely have to accomplish?
See Chapter 4 for advice on planning your days using time-blocking.

 Chapter 20: Ten Time-Efficient Habits
Take Care of Your Health
Taking steps to stay well is one of the best time investments you can make. 
After all, if you lose work time because of frequent illness or you just don’t 
have the stamina to put in a full day of activity, you lose productivity and get 
behind at work and at home.
Eating for optimal performance
You don’t have to fuel up like a mountain climber or marathon runner, 
but eating healthy is as important for desk jockeys as it is for anyone who 
requires his or her body to be in top shape. A proper diet ensures the 
physical and mental energy required for a productive day. Here are some 
eating tips:
 
 Schedule your meals. If you have a tendency to skip meals, work 
them into your daily schedule, along with your business meetings and 
personal appointments.
 
• Breakfast: Don’t skip breakfast. Starting the day on an empty tank 
means you’ll run out of steam before you get everything done.
 
• Lunch: The break in the middle of the day works to rejuvenate you 
as much as the food you consume.
 
 Pass on the empty calories. A bag of chips and a soda may stop your 
stomach from growling, but it doesn’t provide the slow-burning fuel you 
need to make it through the day.
 
 Choose small frequent meals throughout the course of the day. Eating 
just one big meal or two big meals may leave you full and lethargic.
 
 Eat a balanced diet. Learn the basics of nutrition and let science, 
not the latest diet fads, guide your food choices. (For more on basic 
nutrition, visit www.mypyramid.gov or check out Nutrition For 
Dummies, by Carol Ann Rinzler [Wiley].)
Exercising for energy and stamina
I can’t count how often I hear people say that physical activity helps their 
mental outlook as much as their physical well-being. Scientific evidence 
supports that exercise stimulates chemicals that send positive thoughts and 
increased energy to the brain, all sensations important for peak productivity. 
So if you often talk yourself out of going to the gym because you don’t have 
time, consider that you don’t have time not to.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Carrying extra pounds is hard on your body, and it definitely slows you 
down — not the best condition for maximum time efficiency. But even folks 
who don’t have a weight problem benefit from regular physical activity. To 
up your productivity, follow this advice:
 
 Work some physical exercise — as little as 20 minutes — into your 
schedule every day.
 
 If scheduling exercise time is difficult, work it into your day in small 
increments: Park farther from your office to get in a brisk walk; take 
the stairs instead of the elevator; use your lunch hour to get in some 
walking, stretching, or even a half-hour in the gym. Lift hand weights, 
do squats, and/or do crunches in your living room. Don’t refuse to work 
out simply because you can’t do a full hour — you’re missing out on 
valuable opportunities to work your body. A little bit does go a long way.
 
 Find an activity that gets your heart rate up — walking or running, 
bicycling, swimming, or an aerobics class — and participate two or 
three hours a week.
 
 Find an activity you enjoy instead of forcing yourself to follow some 
unappealing regimen.
Sleeping for rejuvenation
Getting enough rest to recharge is paramount. Going to bed early enough so 
you’re well rested can improve your time management and energy level the 
next day. Know your amount of needed rest that your body craves. Establish 
your schedule to coincide with that amount.
One of the best techniques for helping yourself recharge with sleep is 
napping. I’m especially fond of afternoon naps on weekends. They help me 
to catch up on my rest and wake up really refreshed.
Set Aside Downtime
An issue that’s gotten a lot of press in the world of parenting is overschedul-
ing children. Child development experts point out that kids’ schedules are so 
packed with school, music lessons, sports activities, play dates, and other 
commitments that they have virtually no downtime in which to develop their 
creativity and imagination.

323
 Chapter 20: Ten Time-Efficient Habits
Whether you call it prayer, meditation, clearing your mind, quiet time, or 
goofing off, adults need these unstructured blocks of time, too. Extremely 
busy people may find it hard to justify doing nothing when so much 
work awaits them, but these periods of reflection stretch your thinking 
muscles, release built-up stress, and lead you to new insights and greater 
understanding. And that’s hardly “nothing.”
 
I notice a significant improvement in my effectiveness, energy, and outlook 
when I adhere to a morning routine that starts with prayer and reading the 
Bible each day at 5 a.m. Here are some ways to find a quiet time that works 
best for you:
 
 Sit outside, in your backyard or a public garden, and let your mind 
wander.
 
 Take a walk with no destination in mind.
 
 Listen to wordless music.
 
 Meditate.
 
 Read spiritual, inspirational, or thought-provoking material.
 
 Pray — most religions have some tradition of daily prayer.
Plan Meals for the Week
 
My mother, one of the most efficient people I’ve ever known, demonstrated 
her proficiency at organization in the very deliberate way she planned our 
meals. She sat down each week with paper and pencil and mapped out our 
meals for the next seven days, considering our schedules, special occasions 
(birthdays, for example), and what items were on special at the grocery that 
week. She reviewed the cupboards and pantry to make sure she had all the 
ingredients she needed, and then she made her grocery list. When she hit the 
supermarket, she shopped with a plan: Not a superfluous minute was wasted 
on impulse. She was a mom on a mission — she knew what she wanted and 
where to find it. And she only had to do it once a week — no quick stops for a 
forgotten ingredient. My mom’s extreme efficiency in meal planning paid off in 
time freed up to enjoy dinner and conversation with her husband and sons.
Make a habit of making a once-a-week meal plan so you don’t have to waste 
time contemplating what to eat — no more frantic sweeps through a fast-food 
drive-through because you don’t have anything in the house.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
You can apply a weekly-plan habit to aspects of your life other than meals as 
well. For instance, plan what you’re going to wear each day so you can be sure 
everything is washed, returned from the dry cleaner, shined, and repaired.
Delegate Almost Everything
Figure out what’s most important to you, and delegate everything else. In 
Chapter 4, I walk you through the process of identifying your priorities. 
As soon as you have that list (and I suggest you write them down and keep 
them in front of you), you can better determine which activities support 
those priorities and which, though necessary to complete, can be handled 
by someone else.
 
Sometimes, what seems like an activity to be delegated is, in reality, one 
that’s close to the heart of your most cherished values. I can’t say that I’m 
big on playing tea party. But the joy I see in my daughter Annabelle’s face 
when I join her on the floor with her dolls brings me joy and deep fulfillment. I 
wouldn’t delegate doll-playing to anyone. On the other hand, I detest yard 
work. Of course, it’s important to me — and my neighbors — to keep up with 
cutting the grass. But in my grand list of top priorities, spending time in my 
yard doesn’t even make the top 100. So I delegate it, along with other manly 
responsibilities such as changing the oil in my car, repairing a leak in the sink, 
and other choice tasks. Faced with one of these activities, I say, “Pass me the 
imaginary cream, please.”
Say No More Often
You’ve heard it said that if you want something done, then ask a busy person 
to do it. It’s true that the most productive people seem to be able to juggle 
more responsibilities and activities. But what a too-busy person achieves in 
quantity often comes at the cost of quality. To get the most satisfaction out 
of the work you do and the pastimes you engage in, you need to protect them 
from getting swallowed up by other commitments.
 
The demands on your time are limitless. Time is a finite resource. Figure out 
how to recognize when the hourglass is almost out of sand, and protect your 
time by saying no. Return to your list of priorities and evaluate whether your 
plate is filled with unrelated commitments. If so, scrape them off as possible to 
make room for the things that really matter to you. And when the next wave of 
people serves up more requests for your time, politely put your hand over the 
plate and say, “No, thank you. I’m full.”

325
 Chapter 20: Ten Time-Efficient Habits
Always Use a Time Management System
To best retain your time management skills, adopt a system for managing 
your time. And stick to it. With regular use, such a system gets easier to 
use and brings a greater return with time. In Chapter 4, I show you how 
to use time-blocking, a system I stand by because I’ve seen how it yields 
success time and again.
Simplify Your Life
Just as material possessions take up space in your home and office, they 
also clutter up your time. I have a client who lived in Manhattan for several 
years and decided he needed to buy a car. He kept it for less than a year 
before he realized it was costing him money and time: filling it up, maintain-
ing it, parking it, insuring it. He initially bought the car because he thought 
it’d simplify his life, but he quickly realized it added complexity that he 
hadn’t imagined. Life was much simpler when he relied on taxis and subways.
Having and caring for possessions takes a lot of time. The fewer you have, the 
simpler life becomes. I’m not suggesting you return to Walden Pond or join 
a commune. Nothing’s wrong with having things that bring you happiness 
and pleasure. If you love getting in your daily laps and spending time sunning 
yourself by your in-ground swimming pool, savor the joy it brings you when-
ever you can. But the more you can divest yourself of your other leisure toys, 
the more you’re able to focus on your time enjoying the pool.
 
Return to your priorities list and take stock of how your material wealth aligns 
with your goals. Identify what relates, and get rid of as much of the rest as you 
can. Having fewer material burdens is one of the most liberating feelings you 
can experience.
Begin Every Day at Zero
Leave all your baggage from the day before where it belongs: in the past. 
Whatever mistakes, disappointments, losses, embarrassments, and failures 
you suffered yesterday don’t have to affect the outcome of today.
As the saying goes, the past is history. The future is a mystery. Today is a 
gift; that’s why they call it the present. Unwrap each day with the anticipation 
and expectation of unfolding a wonderful day of production, success, fulfill-
ment, service to others, results, and relationship-building. Use your time to 
create the largest, best, most significant return on your time as possible.

T
ime management isn’t just for business. Just as smart use of your time at 
work brings you professional success, adopting time-wise tactics when 
you’re off the clock means more freedom to do the activities you really enjoy 
with the people you most love to be with. Today’s service-oriented economy 
means that finding someone to take on the tasks you don’t have time for is 
easier than ever. Even the most expensive service providers earn far less 
than highly paid professionals. What’s the worth of a few hours a week with 
your family and children? Priceless!
Hire Out Your Yard Work
Some people find mowing the lawn, raking leaves, and planting flowers 
relaxing, even therapeutic. I’m not one of them. Whichever side of the fence 
you’re on, lawn work can add hours to your weekly home maintenance 
responsibilities, and it’s the type of task your neighbors won’t be too 
happy about if you neglect it for long. Why torture yourself when you can 
hire someone else to do it? You can have a well-manicured lawn that all the 
neighbors will envy — and the time to enjoy its dandelion-free beauty.
The sophistication of services ranges from the neighbor kid eager to make 
some summer money to the landscaper maneuvering a machine that looks 
like it could compete in a monster truck show. Ask your friends who they use 
for yard work, elicit high school or college age kids, or even look in the nickel 
ads or on Craigslist (www.craigslist.com) to find someone who can fill 
this role.

Invite a Personal Chef for Dinner
I love to cook, but when Joan and I both were running our businesses, neither 
of us had the time to put together so much as a quick dinner of mac and 
cheese! The services of a personal chef can be a lifesaver for a family that 
values healthy, tasty meals.
Our chef came into our home two days a week and prepared fresh meals 
that we kept in the fridge or freezer until we were ready to heat and serve. 
He brought in all his own cookware and ingredients and within a couple of 
hours, he put together a month’s worth of dinners based on a menu that 
we selected in advance. In addition to the entrees, he whipped up snacks, 
salads, and other dishes we could pull out for lunches or to-go meals.
The personal chef movement has found a strong following in cities of all sizes 
throughout the United States. Most services provide a broad menu of options 
that meet any dietary preference or restriction: from low-fat to low-carb, from 
vegetarian to dairy-free. Heck, you can even tailor it to your taste for spicy 
foods or forbid a stalk of broccoli from entering your kitchen. 
The cost for personal chef services varies depending on circumstances, but 
in my experience, you spend significantly less money — and time — than you 
would taking the family out to dinner.
 
If your budget doesn’t allow the luxury of hiring a chef, you may consider two 
alternatives:
 
 Meal-preparation businesses: For a reasonable fee, these businesses 
help you prepare a number of meals for your family in advance. Places 
like Dream Dinners (www.dreamdinners.com) or Dinners Ready (www.
dinnersready.com) do all the work of menu planning, shopping, and 
chopping. You just add a few hours of your time a month to combine all 
the ingredients in the provided bakeware and take it home.
 
 Cooking in bulk: You can set aside a single day to prepare all your 
dinners for a month (or week), freezing or vacuum-sealing the food and 
pulling it out as needed. You make fewer grocery trips, save yourself 
the time of deciding what to fix each night, cut down on cleanup time, 
and reduce the number of nights you have to eat out because you 
don’t feel like cooking. Look for cookbooks or Web sites devoted to 
once-a-month-cooking (OAMC) or freezer cooking.

329
 Chapter 21: Ten Time Savers for Your Personal Life
Hire a House Cleaner
The growth of the home cleaning industry exploded after women began 
entering the workforce in greater numbers, and many discovered that they 
couldn’t and didn’t want to clean the house at all. Fact is, after spending 40 
hours or more every week bringing home the bacon, few women or men care 
to sacrifice two, three, four, or more hours each week to dusting, sweeping, 
washing, and polishing.
Busy people can turn to cleaning professionals to take care of many of these 
thankless tasks. You can choose from self-employed individuals, who may 
work on a more unstructured and informal basis, to home cleaning franchises 
that send out teams that fulfill a precise list of tasks. These businesses typi-
cally provide an estimate based on an hourly rate for a regularly weekly, 
biweekly, or monthly appointment. You agree on exactly what jobs you want 
done (Change the sheets? Make the beds?), and a team of workers sweeps 
into your home and puts it in order in as little as an hour — a job that may 
have taken hours of your time. And the fringe benefit? After a frenzied and 
frustrating day at work, what a joy it is to walk into a gleaming-clean home!
In hiring a house cleaner, a referral from a friend might be the best approach. 
A word of caution: Make sure that your friend’s standard of cleanliness is 
similar to yours. You may want to check out how your friend’s home looks 
right after the cleaner leaves before you consider hiring him or her. 
If a referral isn’t an option, you may want to consider a service like Merry 
Maids or some other national brand for cleaners. The advantage is that most 
national brands require their franchisees and employees to be licensed, 
bonded, or insured (for liability purposes), which gives you a measure of 
confidence in their work.
Enlist Childcare for Errand-Running
I’m blessed to be a father and keenly value all the time that I get to spend 
with my children. That said, taking care of errands such as shopping with 
two kids in tow is not my idea of quality family bonding time. In fact, I 
consider that family bondage time because it takes me twice as long to get 
everything done when they’re along for the ride!

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
When you need to run errands, you’re likely to get a lot more done in a much 
shorter time and with much less pain when you hire a sitter and leave the 
kids at home. Get a referral from a friend, hire a teenager you know well, or 
even trade childcare with a friend who’d appreciate an unencumbered 
errand-run, too.
Use Pick-up and Delivery Services
In terms of pick-up and delivery, businesses today are light years past pizza 
and diaper service. The list of personal business you can take care of without 
getting in your car gets longer every day. I have my dry cleaning picked up 
and delivered for just a few dollars extra. It’s worth the cost to me because 
the time I’d spend driving it to and from the cleaners (when I remember) is 
worth far more to me than a few bucks. I schedule the pickups so I don’t have 
to do anything but hand over my dirty shirts and wait for them to be 
returned, clean and pressed.
Even as more businesses add pickup and delivery services, courier compa-
nies are popping up in communities nationwide to transport merchandise to 
and from your door. Whether you need to get a contract to a client across 
town today or simply can’t swing by the jewelers to pick up that anniversary 
gift before meeting your spouse for dinner in two hours, call on a courier 
service to come to the rescue.
Explore Shopping Alternatives
With all the options for acquiring the merchandise you need or want, you 
may never have to shop at the mall again — unless, of course, you crave the 
slow crawl of parking lot traffic, the challenge of finding a parking space, and 
the thrill of dodging the crowds as you search from store to store for the item 
you’re seeking.
Online shopping makes it easy to find and buy almost anything. Whether 
you head for eBay or click on the Web site of your favorite designer boutique, 
chances are you can order and pay for whatever you want — and have it 
delivered the next day — all in the time it’d take to get your car out of the 
driveway.
Even many grocery stores offer scheduled ordering and delivery services, 
which means you can skip all the steps between making out your list and 
putting the items in the pantry. Order your groceries online, and they’re 
delivered to your door on the day you choose.

331
 Chapter 21: Ten Time Savers for Your Personal Life
Another possibility is to leave the shopping to the pros — the personal 
shoppers, that is. Yes, some people are experts in these matters: They know 
where, when, and how to find just what you need. They can sniff out a sale 
before it’s advertised, and they also offer a valued second opinion on matters 
of style and taste. Although you can hire personal shoppers to help you hunt 
for just about any item (from the perfect wedding gift to office furniture), 
they tend to specialize in wardrobe issues. Some come to your home and 
provide image consultation, review the contents of your closet, take your 
measurements, and itemize your needs. Then, based on the budget you agree 
on, they go to work. Many department and clothing stores also offer in-house 
shopping services.
Check out your local Yellow Pages listings for the “Personal Shopping 
Services” category.
Let the Detailers Come to Your Car
Especially if your job demands that you spend a lot of time in your auto-
mobile, a clean car may be a high priority for you. But taking it to the detailer 
is just one more trip that you’d rather not make time for — and you don’t 
have to. In almost every community, numerous auto detailers offer on-site 
services. While you’re in your office making business appointments, the 
detailer tracks down your car in the parking lot and transforms it into a 
gleaming chariot to whisk you away on your next road trip.
Have a Travel Agent Book Your Trip
Here’s a paradox: As the number of travel Web sites continues to soar, 
planning your own travel can consume more time than ever before. It can 
take hours to find the best flight deal, and then you have to coordinate 
accommodations, car rentals, and other trip details. Getting all the pieces of 
the puzzle to fit can be challenging. Despite all this, it looks like the do-it-
yourself movement is here to stay; however, using a travel professional can 
be a time-saving alternative.
Travel agents have at their disposal some sophisticated tools that others 
don’t. They can take all your trip requirements and limitations and quickly 
come up with an itinerary that meets your demands (“We can travel only 
between the fifth and the twenty-first, we prefer afternoon flights, and our 
flight miles are on Transatlantic Airlines. We need no-smoking rooms in 
hotels that have a fitness center.”). And frequently, they can find deals on 
flights and hotels that your hours online won’t ever unearth.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Most travel agents now charge a service fee, but it’s a small price to pay to 
ensure a stress-free family vacation, second honeymoon, or dream getaway.
Let Someone Else Do the Wrapping
Whenever you have a gift-giving occasion, do your best to look for a two-
for-one deal — by that, I mean buying the gift and having it wrapped in 
one effort. Many stores offer a complimentary gift-wrapping service. Your 
sales attendant takes just a couple of minutes to expertly wrap and add 
a bow to your purchase. At the very least, most shops provide attractive 
boxes and a gift card — sometimes you just have to ask for them. And 
most department stores and shopping malls offer gift-wrapping kiosks in a 
customer service area.
Don’t give up on the idea if you’re shopping by catalog or online — ask 
whether they’ll gift wrap and include a card. This often costs, but it’s 
never more than a few dollars. Better yet, save yourself even more time 
and ask whether they can ship or deliver it to the recipient if you have to 
mail it, anyway.
Write Off Greeting Cards
Recently, a friend introduced me to a fabulous service. It’s called Send Out 
Cards (www.DirkZeller.com/SOC), and it does exactly that: You create an 
account and input your list of card recipients and addresses, the occasions 
you want to send cards for, select your cards from a broad selection or create 
your own custom cards, and even the way you’d like to sign the card. Then, 
for about $1 per mailing, the company does the rest. Every year. On time.
If you’re one of those people who never gets around to sending out birthday 
cards out until a week late — or forgets the occasion entirely — this service 
can be a godsend. And just think about how much time it can save for those 
massive mailings around the holidays.
Many may feel that it’s somehow cheating to pay somebody else to remem-
ber these things, but preparing to send the card in advance is getting it 
done well. This type of service can be a boon for busy professionals who 
know the importance of remembering clients’ special occasions.

 Recording and managing data
 Using online solutions
 Taking technology on the go
E
very day, people introduce more and more technology to save you time. 
This technology, whether created for the home or office or even for use 
on the road, can put minutes and even hours back into each day. Here’s my 
list of personal favorites.
Handheld Digital Voice Recorders
You generate new ideas daily to improve your department, increase your 
service or sales, or help your subordinates. You may even need to remember 
to send flowers or bring a gallon of milk home. With a handheld digital voice 
recorder, you can record numerous messages and save them in folders for 
use now or later. These units are very versatile and cost less than $100 for a 
good version with a number of features.
They’re also effective for dictating letters and other business correspon-
dence. After you have your voice in this digital format, the options are 
endless: e-mail the file, upload it, post it, and edit it.
Many recorders come with additional accessories, such as docking stations 
so you’re always charged and ready to go. Another great feature is a lapel 
microphone. This add-on can really improve the quality and cut out 
unwanted background noise.

Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM) Software
Too many businesses — especially small businesses — are archaic in keeping 
data on customers, clients, and prospects. These businesses have written 
files, forms, notes, custom lists, call sheets, and past work orders that 
double as their database. They also use standard software such as Outlook to 
perform database management functions that it was never designed to do.
I consult, coach, and speak to successful companies regularly, and I’m 
always amazed when I ask about what CRM they use and get a blank look 
from the senior management team. Customer relationship management (CRM) 
is specialized software that you use to keep clients, prospects, customers, 
and suspects in a database. The database of a business is the lifeblood 
of a successful business, and being able to know what you’ve done, sent, 
marketed to, sold to, add-on sold to, or upsold to a client, customer, or 
prospect is good business.
For instance, if you run a heating and air conditioning company, you may be 
able to triple your business with a good CRM program and a solid follow-up 
strategy. You can contact people regularly through the CRM via e-mail, mail, 
and phone — all in bulk with a few keystrokes. You can market your services 
systematically, telling customers to have their air conditioning units serviced 
before the weather gets hot so your service team isn’t overworked when the 
first heat wave hits for the summer. Your customers may also receive better 
service and be more loyal to you because you care enough to remind them.
Numerous quality CRM products are in the marketplace, including ACT! 
(www.act.com) and GoldMine (www.goldmine.com). This software allows 
you to establish multiple users and have everyone working in concert in 
your company or department. Most programs also have scheduling features, 
so you can put your time-block schedule right in your CRM. Most are also 
compatible with PDAs, so you can always have your CRM data and schedule 
wherever you go.
Finance Software or Internet Banking
With the electronic technology age, bill paying is easier than ever before. 
You can enter your bills once in a finance program such as Quicken 
(quicken.intuit.com), and every time you start to enter the first few 
letters, it automatically fills in the categories, the expense, and even the 
last amount from a month ago. You’ll never have to enter more than a few 
characters to pay your mortgage again.

335
 Chapter 22: Ten Great Time-Saving Technologies
You can also print the checks in your printer if you’re more old-fashioned 
(like me) and still like to use checks. I personally like the record-keeping and 
evidence of a check in case I ever get audited.
Most banks offer electronic checking in which you get features similar to 
those of financial software with one more benefit: For a few dollars, you can 
have them mail the checks for you or send the funds electronically if you 
have that set up with your bills, increasing the time savings.
Phone and Web Conferencing Solutions
One exciting category in the telephone communication world is conference 
or bridge lines. These allow you to put hundreds of people on a single call at 
once. On a small scale, you can use a bridge line to have a family call with 
all six of your children who are away from home. In business, you can use a 
bridge line to conduct educational teleseminars, sales presentations, meet-
ings, strategy sessions, and more. Everyone invited on the call has a specific 
phone number to dial and then a multi-digit code so he or she enters the 
right conference line. At Sales Champions, we use these conference lines 
daily with our small-group coaching programs.
Some phone conference services even offer you the feature of recording the 
calls. This allows you to upload the call to your intranet site and allow all the 
people in your organization to hear the training or strategy session. It’s really 
a big value for less than $100 per month.
Beyond the telephone bridge line level, an explosion of technology in 
Web conferencing solutions can enhance your presentations, sales, and 
meetings. A few years ago, your only option was WebEx (www.webex.com). 
It’s certainly a good resource, but you can now opt for GoToMeeting (www.
gotomeeting.com) or even PresentationPro (www.presentationpro.
com). Web presentations are designed to be more interactive. You can take 
polling questions, break off in chat rooms, or allow participants to ask instant 
questions. The participants can also see a PowerPoint presentation just 
as if they were in a seminar or live program. The advantage is that both the 
presenters and listeners can do all this from the comfort of their own homes 
in their slippers and bathrobes (provided, of course, that they aren’t using 
videoconferencing features at the time).
Wireless Headsets
If you’re on the phone a lot, wireless headsets are a phenomenal advance-
ment in technology that can save you hours a day. You don’t even have to 
hold the receiver — your hands are free to flip through documents, take 

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
notes, or do whatever else helps you get your work done. You also don’t 
have to be tied to your desk. You can walk around your office to clear 
your thinking and increase your focus. You can go down the hall to get a 
drink of water, all the while negotiating your big deal. At home, you can 
be cooking dinner, doing the laundry, or dusting while you’re catching up 
with an old friend.
 
Don’t buy an inexpensive wireless headset, or you’ll be disappointed in the 
sound quality. A high-quality headset runs you about $300, but the freedom 
you feel and the increase in your productivity are well worth it. Besides, you 
may have always wanted to look like Janet Jackson on stage.
Mobile Phones and Text Messaging
Although the telephone isn’t a brand new technology, you can always find 
improvements in speed, cost, and expansion options with the telephone. 
With the advancement of mobile technology, people are rarely out of touch. 
You can effectively reach anyone in the world at any time with a few punches 
of the buttons. (Unfortunately, the reverse is also true: You can be inter-
rupted more easily. Turn to Chapter 9 for advice on handling interruptions.)
Mobile phones also give you the ability to text a quick message to get 
through to someone, which can save time or simply give you another avenue 
to communicate. If someone isn’t returning your call, try texting a message to 
save you the time of making more calls.
Instant Messaging
I have to admit I love instant messaging in the office environment. I’m sure it 
works between friends as well, but my use is solely business. To be able to 
send a quick note or delegate a quick, easy item instantly is tremendous.
Instant messaging is really effective when you have colleagues who work in 
different locations. At my companies, I have multiple offices and employees 
in four time zones. Being able to instant message instead of picking up the 
phone and incurring long-distance charges is invaluable.
 
As handy as instant messaging can be, it can also be a huge source of distrac-
tion, leaving you with less time on your hands and less productivity if you 
don’t keep it under wraps. Be sure to turn off your instant message when you 
really need to focus. The sound of a new message can drive you to distraction. 
That flashing toolbar compels most people to stop what they’re doing and see 
what the sender wants.

 Chapter 22: Ten Great Time-Saving Technologies
E-book Readers
I love electronic book readers. In my Sony Reader (www.sonystyle.com), 
I can carry 160 books in something the size of a gift book. It saves me time 
deciding which book to take with me on the road — I can take them all. When 
I feel like reading something light, I can. When I want to read the Bible, a 
business book, a relationship book, or a self-help book, I can do it with ease.
GPS Navigation Systems
One of the best new technologies for people who travel around town or even 
long distances is global positioning system (GPS) navigation. It can save you 
hours in trying to find that pesky address that doesn’t appear on the old 
map. It also saves you the time and cost of looking up and printing out pages 
of directions from an Internet site.
You can even make midcourse corrections when you take a wrong turn. The 
soft computer voice tells you something like, “Recalculating route. Make a 
U-turn in 0.5 miles.” It beats pulling into the nearest gas station and trying to 
get directions from someone who may be as confused as you are.
Digital Video Recorders
Although television is a waste of time in many cases, most people have 
at least a few shows that they enjoy. If you have a digital video recorder 
(DVR), you’ll never miss the shows you really want to watch. Better yet, by 
approaching your TV watching with intention and by setting beginning and 
ending times, you aren’t as likely to get trapped in the mindless approach to 
watching TV, where you’re tempted to channel surf or continue watching 
after your show has ended.
The other advantage is that you can skip every commercial in the program 
and dramatically reduce the time to view a show. An hour-long show often 
cuts down to less than 40 minutes. That’s a time savings of 33 percent just for 
commercial zapping.

Ten Ways to Fine-Tune 
Your Focus on the Job
In This Chapter
 Minimizing distractions
 Motivating yourself to work
M
aking the best use of your time is closely connected to your ability 
to concentrate. That hour you set aside to finish your report should 
be plenty of time. But if you drift away from your effort — perhaps lured 
away by the you’ve-got-mail flag at the bottom of your computer screen — an 
hour doesn’t cut it, and you may end up spending two hours, even more.
Maintaining your focus on those most critical tasks — the ones that bring 
you 80 percent of your achievement — is one of the most perplexing chal-
lenges you face as you strive to effectively manage your time. I’ve identified 
ten habits that anchor your focus where your attention needs to be, rather 
than on the unimportant distractions that so often demand it.
Start Small
Concentration is a skill you can learn. I liken the process to weight training. 
Flexing your concentration muscles requires commitment, regular workout, 
and a willingness to push yourself a little further, bit by bit.
Just as you wouldn’t try to lift a 200-pound barbell on the first day of your 
weight-training program, you don’t want to put an unrealistic strain on 
your concentration efforts as you’re building up your skills. Forcing yourself 
to spend the entire day trying to make sense of all your receipts and files 
to complete your tax return may be more than you can handle in the 
beginning.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Start with lighter weights — the smaller tasks, the less complex projects. And 
build up your time, perhaps starting with segments as short as a half-hour; 
then give yourself a break. Step away from the task to make sure you release 
the tension and give your mind the recess it needs. Get something to drink or 
take a short 5- to 10-minute walk outside. Then go back to your project. As you 
build your endurance, you can increase the work periods, working up to a few 
hours of uninterrupted focus.
Seek Out a Quiet Place
The ambient noise of the world around you — humming computers and 
copiers, ringing phones, the drone of conversation — can distract you, 
reducing your focus and thereby diminishing the effectiveness of your time 
management. When you need to concentrate, seek out a quiet place or a 
quiet time of day. I often get up at 3 a.m. to write: no kids playing or TVs 
chattering, no traffic noise. My ability to focus is far greater in the dead of the 
night merely because of the quiet.
You may not want to change your work hours to the graveyard shift, but to 
maximize your focus and time, look for opportunities to reduce distracting 
noise. Shut your door if you have an office. Seek out an unused conference 
room.
 
Despite your best efforts, you may not be able to eliminate the sound 
distractions that interrupt your focus. So when you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. 
Seriously. Create your own noise. I’m talking about white noise — you 
know, that smooth, even drone that seems to level out the sound challenges. 
Think ocean waves, a gentle rainstorm, the wind rustling through leaves. Look 
for CDs of soothing music or use a small fan to create a constant low-level 
noise. These types of sounds don’t affect your focus, but they do block out 
other noise.
Some people swear by classical music. Some studies indicate that classical 
music helps concentration and creativity. I’ve used classical music to 
help me through all types of projects. My preference is music with a greater 
emphasis on strings. (I tend to avoid works like the “1812 Overture” and 
other compositions with lots of cymbals.) But each person responds 
differently to music. Find what works for you — whatever drowns out other 
sounds and is easiest for you to tune out.
Get an Early Start (or Stay Late)
Some people claim to be early birds; others insist they’re more productive 
later in the day or even at night. But even if you consider yourself a night owl, 

341
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Fine-Tune Your Focus on the Job
I maintain that everyone benefits from getting an early start. You’re always 
freshest first thing, when your day hasn’t had a chance to throw any upsets 
your way. For most professionals, the distractions, problems, and challenges 
increase as the day progresses. The earlier you begin, the less likely you are 
to encounter interruptions. You also have fewer issues to consider and a 
higher level of focus.
 
Heading into work a little earlier than the official start time is a tactic that 
gives you a jumpstart on your progress. Fewer people are at their desks 
or phones to disrupt your concentration. Plus, a productive start works to 
bolster your outlook and energy level for the rest of the day.
Of course, when you can’t work in an early start, another tactic is to stay late. 
You may be a bit more worn down after a long day, but you can still take 
advantage of the more peaceful atmosphere after most of your co-workers 
have left for the day. Stay at your desk and squeeze in an hour or more of 
uninterrupted work — and skip all the rush-hour traffic.
 
You’re better served in increasing your schedule to stay a little late daily or 
for a number of days each week. Staying 3 hours late once or twice a week 
may defeat the purpose: It can cause you to be tired and late the next day. 
A better strategy is to stay an hour late 3 to 4 days a week and make sure you 
leave at that time from work.
Adjust Your Lunch Hour
Move your lunch break away from the noon hour — when everyone else is 
taking lunch — as much as possible. If you get an early start on the day, you 
may want to break by 11 a.m. If you find yourself on a roll, you may prefer to 
hold off until 1 or 2 p.m.
The point is that by steering clear of the busy lunch rush, you increase your 
odds of enjoying a leisurely break (fewer restaurant crowds, a less-congested 
break room), which means you return to your work refreshed and ready to 
focus. And you capitalize on the quiet time, when most of your co-workers 
and business colleagues have clocked out for their midday break. Stay in 
at noon (or the stretch between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.) and discover a 
slower-paced environment more conducive to concentration.
You also may consider eating small meals more frequently, which can help 
you avoid the blood sugar crash that many peoples experience. When their 
bodies are craving fuel, they just feel like they’re stick in low gear. By eating 
the small meals, you can take quick breaks and become energized.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Take Shorter, More Frequent Breaks
You can’t stay focused at high levels for 8 to 10 hours a day if you work in a 
production-oriented job environment. You can save time at work and 
increase productivity by working at intense levels and then taking a short 
break. For most people, 90 to 120 minutes is all their brains can do without 
some relief. Even by taking a 5 to 10 minute break, you raise your energy, 
intensity, and focus.
What are the toughest actions you have to do in your job? What can drain 
you fast? What do you know you need to do but struggle to make yourself do 
consistently? That’s the activity you have to do for shorter durations with 
quick breaks in between. The hardest job for salespeople is prospecting, 
looking for new business, so I always tell salespeople to make 60 minutes of 
prospecting calls and then take a 10 to 15 minute break.
Control Personal Interaction
The coffee machine. The water cooler. The copy room. The workplace can be 
a minefield for the committed employee who wants to be productive. Social 
encounters are waiting around every corner, threatening to blow up your 
well-intentioned plans to get something done.
Personal interaction with others is hard to discourage without coming off as 
antisocial or being labeled the office recluse, but one surefire way to counter 
this result is to plan for social time. You’ve heard of the leadership strategy 
management by walking around? This tactic is an offshoot of that scheme.
 
Schedule your daily social time and seek out your co-workers on a personal 
level. You may want to do this first thing in the morning as employees get 
settled into their day. Or take a break between projects and spend no more 
than a half-hour making the rounds. Catch up on your assistant’s weekend 
ski trip. Find out how your boss’s son did in his soccer game. Check in with 
your office mate who’s recuperating from the flu. Wish the receptionist a 
happy birthday. Then return to your work. It’s a win-win strategy: You remain 
productive, and your co-workers know you as a caring colleague.
If you need to minimize visits from others at inopportune times, put up a sign 
outside your cubicle that says something like “Please do not disturb — hard 
at work. Contact me via e-mail or voice mail from [start time] to [end time]; 
I’ll check e-mail every hour on the hour.”

 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Fine-Tune Your Focus on the Job
Acknowledge and Dismiss 
Distracting Thoughts
Inevitably, when I sit down to slog through a project that demands intense 
concentration, a random thought zips into my consciousness like the 
annoying whine of a mosquito, and I’m off chasing it down. “Did I forget to 
turn off the coffee maker?” “I wonder how Wesley’s field trip went.” “What 
was the name of that book I wanted to read?”
Whenever this happens, I follow a tip from my friends who do yoga. They 
tell me that in order to reach a true state of meditation, they focus on their 
breathing and allow those stray thoughts to flit past their consciousness; 
they don’t fight those thoughts, but they don’t let them settle in, either. It’s 
as though a round of tug-o-war has just ended, and I drop the rope at my 
side; though it’s still there, I’m not fighting with it. I figure out how to be 
present with it. Well, my breathing is my project, and I can let go of those 
random thoughts by making a note so I can follow up and dwell on them 
later, when I’m done with my project.
 
The best strategy is to accept that those distracting thoughts are going 
to hit you. Keep a notepad handy, and when something bubbles up to 
your consciousness, write it down and then forget about it. Because you’ve 
recorded it, you’re more likely to feel comfortable in letting it go.
Reward Yourself for Success
You probably already use the carrot approach to encourage yourself toward 
bigger goals: Get that promotion, and you’ll take the family on a cruise; make 
an important sale, and you’ll buy that pricey designer suit. But rewards 
work just as well for reaching the interim steps that help you get to your goal, 
even on a day-to-day basis. If you love golf and want a new set of clubs, give 
yourself the clubs, one at a time for each day of focus. If you’re struggling to 
complete a report that’s taxing your concentration skills, promise yourself 
that if you wrap it up this afternoon, you’ll reward yourself with a dinner out 
or even a bubble bath, to be redeemed that day.
 
Break down the activities you plan to reward into even the smallest incre-
ments. I know a woman who treats herself to a square of dark chocolate for 
every productive hour she finishes. A med student allows himself to listen to 
one side of a favorite CD after two hours of study. As for me, I induced myself 
with a massage for getting this chapter done today!

Tackle the Big Opportunities
Have you ever noticed that the best athletes, such as Tiger Woods and 
Michael Jordan, raise their level of play for the playoffs or a major 
championship? Champion performers increase their focus and play better 
in the big game because they know more is expected of them.
A challenge can motivate you to perform at a higher, more efficient level. In 
life, success is in stretching yourself to be better and then testing yourself to 
see how you did. When attacking a big opportunity, you’re forced to invest 
time to improve your skills, and you have to invest the attitude to improve 
your future results. Because the big challenges are harder, you also get to 
test your skills.
The other advantage of big opportunities is that they certainly align with the 
80/20 rule (see Chapter 4). It takes the same amount of time and effort to land 
a whale type of account as a minnow type. In sales, you can focus on fishing 
for whales while catching a few minnows in your nets along the way to keep 
your cash flow solid.
Maintain a Steady Pace
Persistence and consistency are traits of successful people. The ability to 
focus, to stay on track, or even to be plodding with your efforts can help you 
work through failure and frustration and eventually achieve your goals. If you 
don’t see the results right away, recognize that you may need more time, so 
invest more time with patience. If you’re seeing progress but the results are 
short, don’t quit — keep on going.
