Preface
The Dictionary of Classical and Theoretical Mathematics, one volume of the Comprehensive
Dictionary of Mathematics, includes entries from the ﬁelds of geometry, logic, number theory,
set theory, and topology. The authors who contributed their work to this volume are professional
mathematicians, active in both teaching and research.
The goal in writing this dictionary has been to deﬁne each term rigorously, not to author a
large and comprehensive survey text in mathematics. Though it has remained our purpose to make
each deﬁnition self-contained, some deﬁnitions unavoidably depend on others, and a modicum of
“deﬁnition chasing” is necessitated. We hope this is minimal.
The authors have attempted to extend the scope of this dictionary to the fringes of commonly
accepted higher mathematics. Surely, some readers will regard an excluded term as being mistak-
enly overlooked, and an included term as one “not quite yet cooked” by years of use by a broad
mathematical community. Such differences in taste cannot be circumnavigated, even by our well-
intentioned and diligent authors. Mathematics is a living and breathing entity, changing daily, so a
list of included terms may be regarded only as a snapshot in time.
We thank the authors who spent countless hours composing original deﬁnitions. In particular, the
help of Dr. Steve Benson, Dr. William Harris, and Dr. Tamara Hummel was key in organizing the
collection of terms. Our hope is that this dictionary becomes a valuable source for students, teachers,
researchers, and professionals.

absolute value
A
Abelian category 
An additive category C,
which satisﬁes the following conditions, for any
morphism f ∈ HomC(X, Y):
(i.) f has a kernel (a morphism i ∈ HomC
(X′, X)  such that f i = 0) and a co-kernel (a
morphism p ∈ HomC(Y, Y ′) such that pf = 0);
(ii.) f may be factored as the composition of
an epic (onto morphism) followed by a monic
(one-to-one morphism) and this factorization is
unique up to equivalent choices for these mor-
phisms;
(iii.) if f is a monic, then it is a kernel; if f
is an epic, then it is a co-kernel.
See additive category.

for all complex numbers s = x+iy with x > σa
but not for any s so that x < σa. If the series
converges absolutely for all s, then σa = −∞
and if the series fails to converge absolutely for
any s, then σa = ∞. The set {x + iy : x > σa}
is called the half plane of absolute convergence
for the series. See also abscissa of convergence.

absolutely for all s, then σc = −∞and if the
series fails to converge absolutely for any s, then
σc = ∞. The abscissa of convergence of the
series is always less than or equal to the abscissa
of absolute convergence (σc ≤σa). The set
{x + iy : x > σc} is called the half plane of
convergence for the series. See also abscissa of
absolute convergence.
absolute neighborhood retract 
A topolog-
ical space W such that, whenever (X, A) is a
pair consisting of a (Hausdorff) normal space
X and a closed subspace A, then any continu-
ous function f : A −→W can be extended
to a continuous function F : U −→W, for
U some open subset of X containing A. Any
absolute retract is an absolute neighborhood re-
tract (ANR). Another example of an ANR is the
n-dimensional sphere, which is not an absolute
retract.

that, whenever (X, A) is a pair consisting of a

spaceA, thenanycontinuousfunctionf : A −→
W can be extended to a continuous function
F : X −→W. For example, the unit interval
is an absolute retract; this is the content of the
Tietze Extension Theorem. See also absolute

Equivalently, |r| =

magnitude of r.
(2) If z = x + iy is a complex number, then
|z|, also referred to as the norm or modulus of
z, equals

x2 + y2. For example, |1 −2i| =

1 + a2

In particular, if a is a real or complex number,
then |a| is the distance from a to 0.
abundant number 
A positive integer n hav-
ing the property that the sum of its positive di-
visors is greater than 2n, i.e., σ(n) > 2n. For
example, 24 is abundant, since
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60 > 48 .

accumulation point 
A point x in a topolog-
ical space X such that every neighborhood of x
contains a point of X other than x. That is, for all
open U ⊆X with x ∈U, there is a y ∈U which
is different from x. Equivalently, x ∈X \ {x}.
More generally, x is an accumulation point
of a subset A ⊆X if every neighborhood of x
contains a point of A other than x. That is, for
all open U ⊆X with x ∈U, there is a y ∈
U ∩A which is different from x. Equivalently,
x ∈A \ {x}.
additive category 
A category C with the fol-
lowing properties:
(i.) the Cartesian product of any two ele-
ments of Obj(C) is again in Obj(C);
(ii.) HomC(A, B)isanadditiveAbeliangroup
with identity element 0, for any A, B ∈Obj(C);
(iii.) the distributive laws f (g1 + g2) =
fg1 +fg1 and (f1 +f2)g = f1g+f2g hold for
morphisms when the compositions are deﬁned.
See category.
additive function 
An arithmetic function f
having the property that f (mn) = f (m)+f (n)
whenever m and n are relatively prime. (See
arithmetic function). For example, ω, the num-
ber of distinct prime divisors function, is ad-
ditive. The values of an additive function de-
pend only on its values at powers of primes: if
n = pi1
1 · · · pik
k and f is additive, then f (n) =
f (pi1
1 ) + . . . + f (pik
k ). See also completely ad-
ditive function.
additive functor 
An additive functor F :
C →D, between two additive categories, such
that F(f + g) = F(f ) + F(g) for any f, g ∈
HomC(A, B). See additive category, functor.
Adem relations 
The relations in the Steenrod
algebra which describe a product of pth power
or square operations as a linear combination of
products of these operations. For the square op-
erations (p = 2), when 0 < i < 2j,
Sqi Sqj =

0≤k≤[i/2]
 j −k − 1
i − 2k
	
Sqi+j−k Sqk,
where [i/2] is the greatest integer less than or
equal to i/2 and the binomial coefﬁcients in the
sum are taken mod 2, since the square operations
are a Z/2-algebra.
As a consequence of the values of the bino-
mial coefﬁcients, Sq2n−1 Sqn = 0 for all values
of n.
The relations for Steenrod algebra of pth
power operations are similar.
adjoint functor 
If X is a ﬁxed object in a
category X, the covariant functor Hom∗: X →
Sets maps A ∈Obj (X) to HomX (X, A); f ∈
HomX (A, A′) is mapped to f∗: HomX (X, A)
→HomX (X, A′) by g →fg. The contravari-
ant functor Hom∗: X →Sets maps A ∈Obj(X)
to HomX (A, X); f ∈HomX (A, A′) is mapped
to
f ∗: HomX (A′, X) →HomX (A, X) ,
by g →gf .
Let C, D be categories. Two covariant func-
tors F : C →D and G : D →C are adjoint
functors if, for any A, A′ ∈Obj(C), B, B′ ∈
Obj(D), there exists a bijection
φ : HomC(A, G(B)) →HomD(F(A), B)
that makes the following diagrams commute for
any f : A →A′ in C, g : B →B′ in D:

alephs 
Form the sequence of inﬁnite cardinal
numbers (ℵα), where α is an ordinal number.
Alexander’s Horned Sphere 
An example of
a two sphere in R3 whose complement in R3 is
not topologically equivalent to the complement
of the standard two sphere S2 ⊂R3.
This space may be constructed as follows:
On the standard two sphere S2, choose two mu-
tually disjoint disks and extend each to form two
“horns” whose tips form a pair of parallel disks.
On each of the parallel disks, form a pair of
horns with parallel disk tips in which each pair
of horns interlocks the other and where the dis-
tance between each pair of horn tips is half the
previous distance. Continuing this process, at
stage n, 2n pairwise linked horns are created.
In the limit, as the number of stages of the
construction approaches inﬁnity, the tips of the
horns form a set of limit points in R3 homeomor-
phic to the Cantor set. The resulting surface is
homeomorphic to the standard two sphere S2 but
the complement in R3 is not simply connected.
algebra of sets 
A collection of subsets S of a
non-empty set X which contains X and is closed
with respect to the formation of ﬁnite unions,
intersections, and differences. More precisely,
(i.) X ∈S;
(ii.) if A, B ∈S, then A ∪B, A ∩B, and
A\B are also in S.
See union, difference of sets.
algebraic number

which is a zero of a polynomial with rational co-
efﬁcients (i.e., α is algebraic if there exist ratio-

aiαi = 0).
For example,
√
2 is an algebraic number since
it satisﬁes the equation x2 − 2 = 0. Since there
is no polynomial p(x) with rational coefﬁcients
such that p(π) = 0, we see that π is not an al-
gebraic number. A complex number that is not
an algebraic number is called a transcendental
number.
(2) If F is a ﬁeld, then α is said to be al-
gebraic over F if α is a zero of a polynomial
having coefﬁcients in F. That is, if there exist
elements f0, f1, f2, . . . , fn of F so that f0 +
f1α + f2α2 · · · + fnαn = 0, then α is algebraic
over F.
algebraic number ﬁeld 
A subﬁeld of the
complex numbers consisting entirely of alge-
braic numbers. See also algebraic number.
algebraic number theory 
That branch of
mathematics involving the study of algebraic
numbers and their generalizations. It can be ar-
guedthatthegenesisofalgebraicnumbertheory
was Fermat’s Last Theorem since much of the
results and techniques of the subject sprung di-
rectly or indirectly from attempts to prove the
Fermat conjecture.
algebraic variety 
Let A be a polynomial ring
k[x1, . . . , xn] over a ﬁeld k. An afﬁne algebraic
variety is a closed subset of An (in the Zariski
topology of An) which is not the union of two
proper (Zariski) closed subsets of An. In the
Zariski topology, a closed set is the set of com-
mon zeros of a set of polynomials. Thus, an
afﬁne algebraic variety is a subset of An which
is the set of common zeros of a set of polynomi-

als but which cannot be expressed as the union
of two such sets.
The topology on an afﬁne variety is inherited
from An.
In general, an (abstract) algebraic variety is a
topological space with open sets Ui whose union
is the whole space and each of which has an
afﬁne algebraic variety structure so that the in-
duced variety structures (from Ui and Uj ) on
each intersection Ui ∩Uj are isomorphic.
Thesolutionstoanypolynomialequationform
an algebraic variety. Real and complex projec-
tive spaces can be described as algebraic vari-
eties (k is the ﬁeld of real or complex numbers,
respectively).
altitude 
In plane geometry, a line segment
joining a vertex of a triangle to the line through
the opposite side and perpendicular to the line.
The term is also used to describe the length of
the line segment. The area of a triangle is given
by one half the product of the length of any side
and the length of the corresponding altitude.
amicable pair of integers 
Two positive in-
tegers m and n such that the sum of the positive
divisors of both m and n is equal to the sum of
m and n, i.e., σ(m) = σ(n) = m + n. For
example, 220 and 284 form an amicable pair,
since
σ(220) = σ(284) = 504 .
A perfect number forms an amicable pair with
itself.
analyticnumbertheory 
Thatbranchofmath-
ematics in which the methods and ideas of real
and complex analysis are applied to problems
concerning integers.
analytic set 
The continuous image of a Borel
set. More precisely, if X is a Polish space and
A ⊆X, then A is analytic if there is a Borel set B
contained in a Polish space Y and a continuous
f : X →Y with f (A) = B. Equivalently, A
is analytic if it is the projection in X of a closed
set
C ⊆X × NN ,
where NN is the Baire space. Every Borel set is
analytic, but there are analytic sets that are not
Borel. The collection of analytic sets is denoted
1
1. See also Borel set, projective set.
annulus
A topological space homeomorphic
to the product of the sphere Sn and the closed
unitintervalI. Thetermsometimesrefersspecif-
ically to a closed subset of the plane bounded by
two concentric circles.
antichain
A subset A of a partially ordered
set (P, ≤) such that any two distinct elements
x, y ∈A are not comparable under the ordering
≤. Symbolically, neither x ≤y nor y ≤x for
any x, y ∈A.
arc
A subset of a topological space, homeo-
morphic to the closed unit interval [0, 1].
arcwise connected component
If p is a point
in a topological space X, then the arcwise con-
nected component of p in X is the set of points
q in X such that there is an arc (in X) joining
p to q. That is, for any point q distinct from
p in the arc component of p there is a homeo-
morphism φ : [0, 1] −→J of the unit interval
onto some subspace J containing p and q. The
arcwise connected component of p is the largest
arcwise connected subspace of X containing p.
arcwiseconnectedtopologicalspace
Atopo-
logical space X such that, given any two distinct
points p and q in X, there is a subspace J of X
homeomorphic to the unit interval [0, 1] con-
taining both p and q.
arithmetical hierarchy
A method of classi-
fying the complexity of a set of natural numbers
based on the quantiﬁer complexity of its deﬁ-
nition. The arithmetical hierarchy consists of
classes of sets 0
n, 0
n, and 0
n, for n ≥0.
A set A is in 0
0 = 0
0 if it is recursive (com-
putable). For n ≥1, a set A is in 0
n if there is
a computable (recursive) (n+1)–ary relation R
such that for all natural numbers x,
x ∈A ⇐⇒(∃y1)(∀y2) . . . (Qnyn)R(x, y),
where Qn is ∃if n is odd and Qn is ∀if n is
odd, and where y abbreviates y1, . . . , yn. For
n ≥1, a set A is in 0
n if there is a computable
(recursive) (n + 1)–ary relation R such that for

atom of a Boolean algebra
all natural numbers x,
x ∈A ⇐⇒(∀y1)(∃y2) . . . (Qnyn)R(x, y),
where Qn is ∃ if n is even and Qn is ∀ if n is
odd. For n ≥ 0, a set A is in 0
n if it is in both
0
n and 0
n.
Note that it sufﬁces to deﬁne the classes 0
n
and 0
n as above since, using a computable cod-
ing function, pairs of like quantiﬁers (for exam-
ple, (∃y1)(∃y2)) can be contracted to a single
quantiﬁer ((∃y)). The superscript 0 in 0
n, 0
n,
0
n is sometimes omitted and indicates classes
in the arithmetical hierarchy, as opposed to the
analytical hierarchy.
A set A is arithmetical if it belongs to the
arithmetical hierarchy; i.e., if, for some n, A
is in 0
n or 0
n. For example, any computably
(recursively) enumerable set is in 0
1.
arithmetical set 
A set A which belongs to
the arithmetical hierarchy; i.e., for some n, A
is in 0
n or 0
n. See arithmetical hierarchy. For
example, any computably (recursively) enumer-
able set is in 0
1.
arithmetic function 
A function whose do-
main is the set of positive integers. Usually, an
arithmetic function measures some property of
an integer, e.g., the Euler phi function φ or the
sum of divisors function σ. The properties of
the function itself, such as its order of growth or
whether or not it is multiplicative, are often stud-
ied. Arithmetic functions are also called number
theoretic functions.
Aronszajn tree 
A tree of height ω1 which
has no uncountable branches or levels. Thus,
for each α < ω1, the α-level of T , Levα(T ),
given by

t ∈T : ordertype({s ∈T : s < t}) = α

is countable, Levω1(T ) is the ﬁrst empty level of
T , and any set B ⊆T which is totally ordered
by < (branch) is countable. An Aronszajn tree
is constructible in ZFC without any extra set-
theoretic hypotheses.
For any regular cardinal κ, a κ-Aronszajn tree
is a tree of height κ in which all levels have size
less than κ and all branches have length less than
κ. See also Suslin tree, Kurepa tree.
associated ﬁber bundle 
A concept in the
theory of ﬁber bundles. A ﬁber bundle ζ con-
sists of a space B called the base space, a space
E called the total space, a space F called the
ﬁber, a topological group G of transformations
of F, and a map π : E −→B. There is a
covering of B by open sets Ui and homeomor-
phisms φi : Ui × F −→Ei = π−1(Ui) such
that π ◦φi(x, V ) = x. This identiﬁes π−1(x)
with the ﬁber F. When two sets Ui and Uj over-
lap, the two identiﬁcations are related by coor-
dinate transformations gij(x) of F, which are
required to be continuously varying elements of
G. If G also acts as a group of transformations
on a space F ′, then the associated ﬁber bundle
ζ ′ = π′ : E′ −→B is the (uniquely deter-
mined) ﬁber bundle with the same base space
B, ﬁber F ′, and the same coordinate transfor-
mations as ζ.
associated principal ﬁber bundle 
The asso-
ciated ﬁber bundle, of a ﬁber bundle ζ, with the
ﬁber F replaced by the group G. See associated
ﬁber bundle. The group acts by left multiplica-
tion, and the coordinate transformations gij are
the same as those of the bundle ζ.
atomic formula
Let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage.
An atomic formula is an expression
which has the form P(t1, . . . , tn), where P is
an n-place predicate symbol of L and t1, . . . , tn
are terms of L. If L contains equality (=), then
= is viewed as a two-place predicate. Conse-
quently, if t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is an
atomic formula.
atomic model
A model A in a language L
such that every n-tuple of elements of A sat-
isﬁes a complete formula in T , the theory of
A.
That is, for any ¯a ∈An, there is an L-
formula θ(¯x) such that A |= θ(¯a), and for any
L-formula φ, either T ⊢∀¯x

θ(¯x) →φ(¯x)

or
T ⊢∀¯x

θ(¯x) →¬φ(¯x)

. This is equivalent
to the complete type of every ¯a being principal.
Any ﬁnite model is atomic, as is the standard
model of number theory.
atom of a Boolean algebra
If (B, ∨, ∧,
∼, 1, 0) is a Boolean algebra, a ∈B is an atom
if it is a minimal element of B\{0}. For exam-

automorphism
ple, in the Boolean algebra of the power set of
any nonempty set, any singleton set is an atom.
automorphism 
Let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage and let A be a structure for L. An auto-
morphism of A is an isomorphism from A onto
itself. See isomorphism.
axiomatic set theory 
A collection of state-
mentsconcerningsettheorywhichcanbeproved
from a collection of fundamental axioms. The
validity of the statements in the theory plays no
role; rather, one is only concerned with the fact
that they can be deduced from the axioms.
Axiom of Choice 
Suppose that {Xα}α∈ is
a family of non-empty, pairwise disjoint sets.
Then there exists a set Y which consists of ex-
actly one element from each set in the family.
Equivalently, given any family of non-empty
sets{Xα}α∈, thereexistsafunctionf : {Xα}α∈
→
α∈ Xα such that f (Xα) ∈Xα for each
α ∈.
The existence of such a set Y or function f
can be proved from the Zermelo-Fraenkel ax-
ioms when there are only ﬁnitely many sets in
the family. However, when there are inﬁnitely
many sets in the family it is impossible to prove
that such Y, f exist or do not exist. Therefore,
neither the Axiom of Choice nor its negation can
be proved from the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory.
Axiom of Comprehension 
Also called Ax-
iom of Separation. See Axiom of Separation.
Axiom of Constructibility 
Every set is con-
structible. See constructible set.
Axiom of Dependent Choice 
See principle
of dependent choices.
Axiom of Determinancy 
For any set X ⊆
ωω, the game GX is determined. This axiom
contradicts the Axiom of Choice. See deter-
mined.
Axiom of Equality 
If two sets are equal,
then they have the same elements. This is the
converse of the Axiom of Extensionality and is
considered to be an axiom of logic, not an axiom
of set theory.
Axiom of Extensionality 
If two sets have the
same elements, then they are equal. This is one
of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
Axiom of Foundation 
Same as the Axiom
of Regularity. See Axiom of Regularity.
Axiom of Inﬁnity 
There exists an inﬁnite set.
This is one of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory. See inﬁnite set.
Axiom of Regularity 
Every non-empty set
has an ∈ -minimal element. More precisely, ev-
ery non-empty set S contains an element x ∈S
with the property that there is no element y ∈S
such that y ∈x. This is one of the axioms of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
Axiom of Replacement 
If f is a function,
then, for every set X, there exists a set f (X) =
{f (x) : x ∈X}. This is one of the axioms of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
Axiom of Separation 
If P is a property and
X is a set, then there exists a set Y = {x ∈X : x
satisﬁes property P}.
This is one of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraen-
kel set theory. It is a weaker version of the Ax-
iom of Comprehension: if P is a property, then
there exists a set Y = {X : X satisﬁes property
P}. Russell’s Paradox shows that the Axiom of
Comprehension is false for sets. See also Rus-
sell’s Paradox.
Axiom of Subsets 
Same as the Axiom of
Separation. See Axiom of Separation.
Axiom of the Empty Set
There exists a set
∅which has no elements.
Axiom of the Power Set
For every set X,
there exists a set P(X), the set of all subsets of
X. This is one of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraen-
kel set theory.
Axiom of the Unordered Pair
If X and Y are
sets, then there exists a set {X, Y}. This axiom,

Baire class 
The Baire classes Bα are an in-
creasing sequence of families of functions de-
ﬁned inductively for α < ω1. B0 is the set of
continuous functions. For α > 0, f is in Baire
class α if there is a sequence of functions {fn}
converging pointwise to f , with fn ∈Bβn and
βn < α for each n. Thus, f is in Baire class
1 (or is Baire-1) if it is the pointwise limit of
a sequence of continuous functions. In some
cases, it is useful to deﬁne the classes so that if
f ∈Bα, then f /∈Bβ for any β < α. See also
Baire function.
Baire function 
A function belonging to one
of the Baire classes, Bα, for some α < ω1.
Equivalently, the set of Baire functions in a topo-
logical space is the smallest collection contain-
ing all continuous functions which is closed un-
der pointwise limits. See Baire class.
It is a theorem that f is a Baire function if
and only if f is Borel measurable, that is, if and
only if f −1(U) is a Borel set for any open set
U.
Baire measurable function 
A function f :
X →Y, where X and Y are topological spaces,
such that the inverse image of any open set has
the Baire property. See Baire property. That is,
if V ⊆Y is open, then
f −1(V ) = UC = (U \ C) ∪(C \ U) ,
where U ⊆X is open and C ⊆X is meager.
Baire property
A set that can be written as
an open set modulo a ﬁrst category or meager
set. That is, X has the Baire property if there is
an open set U and a meager set C with
X = UC = (U \ C) ∪(C \ U) .
Since the meager sets form a σ-ideal, this hap-
pens if and only if there is an open set U and
meager sets C and D with X = (U \ C) ∪D.
Every Borel set has the Baire property; in fact,
every analytic set has the Baire property.
Baire space
(1) A topological space X such
that no nonempty open set in X is meager (ﬁrst
category). That is, no open set U ̸= ∅in X
may be written as a countable union of nowhere
dense sets. Equivalently, X is a Baire space if
and only if the intersection of any countable col-
lection of dense open sets in X is dense, which is
true if and only if, for any countable collection of
closed sets {Cn} with empty interior, their union
∪Cn also has empty interior. The Baire Cate-
gory Theorem states that any complete metric
space is a Baire space.
(2) The Baire space is the set of all inﬁnite se-
quences of natural numbers, NN, with the prod-
uct topology and using the discrete topology on
each copy of N. Thus, U is a basic open set in
NN if there is a ﬁnite sequence of natural num-
bers σ such that U is the set of all inﬁnite se-
quences which begin with σ. The Baire space
is homeomorphic to the irrationals.
bar construction
For a group G, one can
construct a space BG as the geometric realiza-
tion of the following simplicial complex. The
faces Fn in simplicial degree n are given by
(n + 1)-tuples of elements of G. The boundary
maps Fn −→Fn−1 are given by the simplicial
boundary formula
n

i=0
(−1)i(g0, . . . , ˆgi, . . . , gn)
where the notation ˆgi indicates that gi is omitted
to obtain an n-tuple. The ith degeneracy map
si : Fn −→Fn+1 is given by inserting the group
identity element in the ith position.
Example: B(Z/2), the classifying space of
the group Z/2, is RP ∞, real inﬁnite projective
space (the union of RP n for all n positive inte-
gers).
The bar construction has many generaliza-
tions and is a useful means of constructing the
nerve of a category or the classifying space of a
group, which determines the vector bundles of
a manifold with the group acting on the ﬁber.

Bernays-Gödel set theory
where each rj = 0, 1, ..., b − 1, and r is repre-
sented in the notation
r = rNrN−1 · · · r0.r−1r−2 · · · .
For example, the base of the standard decimal
system is 10 and we need the digits 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in order to use this system.
Similarly, we use only the digits 0 and 1 in the
binary system; this is a “base 2” system. In
the base b system, the number 10215.2011 is
equivalent to the decimal number
1 × b4 + 0 × b3 + 2 × b2 + 1 × b + 5 + 2 × b−1
+0 × b−2 + 1 × b−3 + 1 × b−4 .
That is, each place represents a speciﬁc power
of the base b. See also radix.
Bernays-Gödel set theory 
An axiomatic set
theory, which is based on axioms other than
those of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Bernays-
Gödel set theory considers two types of objects:
sets and classes. Every set is a class, but the
converse is not true; classes that are not sets
are called proper classes. This theory has the
Axioms of Inﬁnity, Union, Power Set, Replace-
ment, Regularity, and Unordered Pair for sets
from Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. It also has
the following axioms, with classes written in :
(i.) Axiom of Extensionality (for classes):
Suppose that X and Y are two classes such that
U ∈X if and only if U ∈Y for all set U. Then
X = Y.
(ii.) If X ∈Y, then X is a set.
(iii.) Axiom of Comprehension: For any for-
mula F(X) having sets as variables there exists
a class Y consisting of all sets satisfying the for-
mula F(X).
Bertrand’s postulate 
If x is a real number
greater than 1, then there is at least one prime
number p so that x < p < 2x. Bertrand’s Pos-
tulate was conjectured to be true by the French
mathematician Joseph Louis Francois Bertrand
and later proved by the Russian mathematician
Pafnuty Lvovich Tchebychef.
Betti number 
Suppose X is a space whose
homology groups are ﬁnitely generated. Then
the kth homology group is isomorphic to the di-
rect sum of a torsion group Tk and a free Abelian
group Bk. The kth Betti number bk(X) of X is
the rank of Bk. Equivalently, bk(X) is the di-
mension of Hk(X, Q), the kth homology group
with rational coefﬁcients, viewed as a vector
space over the rationals. For example, b0(X)
is the number of connected components of X.
bijection 
A function f : X →Y, between
two sets, with the following two properties:
(i.) f is one-to-one (if x1, x2 ∈X and f (x1)
= f (x2), then x1 = x2);
(ii.) f is onto (for any y ∈Y there exists an
x ∈X such that f (x) = y).

Bockstein operation
In cohomology theory,
a cohomology operation is a natural transfor-
mation between two cohomology functors. If
0 →A →B →C →0 is a short exact se-
quence of modules over a ring R, and if X ⊂Y
are topological spaces, then there is a long exact
sequence in cohomology:
· · · →H q(X, Y; A) →H q(X, Y; B) →
H q(X, Y; C) →
H q+1(X, Y; A) →H q+1(X, Y; B) →. . . .
The homomorphism
β : H q(X, Y; C) →H q+1(X, Y; A)
is the Bockstein (cohomology) operation.

bounded quantiﬁer
Bolzano-Weierstrass
Theorem 
Every
bounded sequence in R has a convergent sub-
sequence. That is, if
{xn : n ∈N} ⊆[a, b]
is an inﬁnite sequence, then there is an increas-
ing sequence {nk : k ∈N} ⊆N such that
{xnk : k ∈N} converges.
Boolean algebra 
A non-empty set X, along
withtwobinaryoperations∪and∩(calledunion
and intersection, respectively), a unary opera-
tion ′ (called complement), and two elements
0, 1 ∈X which satisfy the following properties
for all A, B, C ∈X.
(i.) A ∪(B ∪C) = (A ∪B) ∪C
(ii.) A ∩(B ∩C) = (A ∩B) ∩C
(iii.) A ∪B = B ∪A
(iv.) A ∩B = B ∩A
(v.) A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C)
(vi.) A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C)
(vii.) A ∪ 0 = A and A ∩ 1 = A
(viii.) There exists an element A′ so that A∪
A′ = 1 and A ∩A′ = 0.
Borel measurable function 
A function f :
X →Y, for X, Y topological spaces, such that
the inverse image of any open set is a Borel set.
This is equivalent to requiring the inverse image
of any Borel set to be Borel. Any continuous
function is Borel measurable.
It is a theorem that f is Borel measurable
if and only if f is a Baire function. See Baire
function.
Borel set 
The collection B of Borel sets of
a topological space X is the smallest σ-algebra
containing all open sets of X. That is, in addition
to containing open sets, B must be closed under
complements and countable intersections (and,
thus, is also closed under countable unions). For
comparison, the topology on X is closed under
arbitrary unions but only ﬁnite intersections.
Borel sets may also be deﬁned inductively:
let 0
1 denote the collection of open sets and 0
1
the closed sets. Then for 1 < α < ω1, A ∈0
α
if and only if
A = ∪n∈NAn
where, for each n ∈N, An ∈0
αn and αn < α.
A set B is in 0
α if and only if the complement
of B is in 0
α. Then the collection of all Borel
sets is
B = ∪α<ω10
α = ∪α<ω10
α .
Sets in 0
2 are also known as Fσ sets; sets in 0
2
are Gδ.
If the space X is metrizable, then closed sets
are Gδ and open sets are Fσ . In this case, we
have for all α < ω1,
0
α ∪0
α ⊆0
α+1 ∩0
α+1 .
This puts the Borel sets in a hierarchy of length
ω1 known as the Borel hierarchy. See also pro-
jective set.
bound 
(1) An upper bound on a set, S, of
real numbers is a number u so that u ≥s for all
s ∈S. If such a u exists, S is said to be bounded
above by u. Note that if u is an upper bound for
the set S, then so is any number larger than u.
See also least upper bound.
(2) A lower bound on a set, S, of real numbers
is a number ℓ so that ℓ≤s for all s ∈S. If such
an ℓ exists, S is said to be bounded below by ℓ.
Note that if ℓ is a lower bound for the set S, then
so is any number smaller than ℓ. See greatest
lower bound.
(3) A bound on a set, S, of real numbers is a
number b so that |s| ≤b for all s ∈S.
boundary group (homology)
If {Cn, ∂n} is
a chain complex (of Abelian groups), then the
kth boundary group Bk is the subgroup of Ck
consisting of elements of the form ∂c for c in
Ck+1. That is, Bk = ∂Ck+1.
boundaryoperator
Achaincomplex{Cn, ∂n}
consists of a sequence of groups or modules
over a ring R, together with homomorphisms
∂n : Cn −→Cn−1, such that ∂n−1 ◦∂n = 0.
The homomorphisms ∂n are called the boundary
operators. Speciﬁcally, if K is an ordered sim-
plicial complex and Cn is the free Abelian group
generated by the n-dimensional simplices, then
the boundary operator is deﬁned by taking any
n-simplex σ to the alternating sum of its n −1-
dimensional faces. This deﬁnition is then ex-
tended to a homomorphism.
bounded quantiﬁer
The quantiﬁers ∀x < y
and ∃x < y. The statement ∀x < y φ(x) is

bound variable
equivalent to ∀x(x < y →φ(x)), and ∃x <
y φ(x) is equivalent to ∃x(x < y ∧φ(x)).
More generally, ∀x ∈y φ(x) is equivalent
to ∀x(x ∈y →φ(x)) and ∃x ∈y φ(x) is
equivalent to ∃x(x ∈y ∧φ(x)).
bound variable
Let L be a ﬁrst-order lan-
guage and let ϕ be a well-formed formula of L.
An occurrence of a variable v in ϕ is bound if
it occurs as the variable of a quantiﬁer or within
the scope of a quantiﬁer ∀v or ∃v. The scope of
the quantiﬁer ∀v in a formula ∀vα is α.
For example, the ﬁrst occurrence of the vari-
able v1 is free, while the remaining occurrences
are bound in the formula
∀v2(v1 = v2 →∀v1(v1 = v3)).
All occurrences of the variable v1 are bound in
the formula
∀v1(v1 = v2 →∀v1(v1 = v3)).
box topology
A topology on the Cartesian
product

α∈A
Xα
of a collection of topological spaces Xα, having
as a basis the set of all open boxes, 
α∈A Uα,
where each Uα is an open subset of Xα. The dif-
ference between this and the product topology is
that in the box topology, there are no restrictions
on any of the Uα.
Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem
Any con-
tinuous mapping f of a ﬁnite product of copies
of [0, 1] to itself, or of Sn to itself, has a ﬁxed
point, that is, a point z such that f (z) = z.
Intuitively, if a piece of paper is taken off a
table, crumpled up, and laid back down on the
same part of the table, then at least one point is
exactly above the same point on the table that it
was originally.
bundle group
A group that acts (continu-
ously) on a vector bundle or ﬁber bundle E −→
B and preserves ﬁbers (so the action restricts to
an action on each inverse image of a point in B).
For example, the real orthogonal group O(n) is
a bundle group for any rank n real vector bundle.
If the bundle is orientable, then SO(n) is also a
bundle group for the vector bundle.
Thebundlegroupmayalsobecalledthestruc-
ture group of the bundle.
bundle mapping
A ﬁber preserving map g :
E −→E′, where p : E −→B and p′ : E′ −→
B′ are ﬁber bundles. If the bundles are smooth
vector bundles, then g must be a smooth map
and linear on the vector space ﬁbers.
Example: When a manifold is embedded in
Rn, it has both a tangent and a normal bundle.
The direct sum of these is the trivial bundle M ×
Rn; each inclusion into the trivial rank n bundle
is a bundle mapping.
bundle of planes
A ﬁber bundle whose ﬁbers
are all homeomorphic to R2. A canonical exam-
ple of this is given by considering the Grass-
mann manifold of planes in Rn.
Each point
corresponds to a plane in Rn in the same way
each point of the projective space RPn−1 cor-
responds to a line in Rn. The bundle of planes
over this manifold is given by allowing the ﬁber
over each point in the manifold to be the actual
plane represented by that point. If one consid-
ers the manifold as the collection of names of
the planes, then the bundle is the collection of
planes, parameterized by their “names”.

C
canonical bundle 
If the points of a space
represent (continuously parameterized) geomet-
ric objects, then the space has a canonical bun-
dle given by setting the ﬁber above each point
to be the geometric object to which that point
corresponds. Examples include the canonical
line bundle of projective space and the canon-
ical vector bundle over a Grassmann manifold
(the manifold of afﬁne n-spaces in Rm).
canonical line bundle 
Projective space RPn
can be considered as the space of all lines in
Rn+1 which go through the origin or, equiva-
lently, as the quotient of Sn+1 formed by iden-
tifying each point with its negative. The canon-
ical line bundle over RPn is the rank one vector
bundle formed by taking as ﬁber over a point in
RPn the actual line that the point represents.
Example: RP1 is homeomorphic to S1; the
canonical line bundle over RP1 is homeomor-
phic to the Möbius band.
There are also projective spaces formed over
complex or quaternionic space, where a line is
a complex or quaternionic line.
Cantor-Bernstein Theorem 
If A and B are
sets, and f : A →B, g : B →A are injective
functions, then there exists a bijection h: A →
B. This theorem is also known as the Cantor-
Schröder-Bernstein Theorem or the Schröder-
Bernstein Theorem.
Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein Theorem
See
Cantor-Bernstein Theorem.
Cantor set
(1) (The standard Cantor set.) A
subset of R1 which is an example of a totally dis-
connected compact topological space in which
every element is a limit point of the set.
To construct the Cantor set as a subset of
[0, 1], let I0 = [0, 1] ⊂R1, I1 = [0, 1
3] ∪[ 2
3, 1]
and I2 = [0, 1
9]∪[ 2
9, 1
3]∪[ 2
3, 7
9]∪[ 8
9, 1]. In gen-
eral, deﬁne In to be the union of closed intervals
obtained by removing the open “middle thirds”
from each of the closed intervals comprising
In−1. The Cantor set is deﬁned as C = ∩∞
n=1In.
The Cantor set has length 0, which can be
veriﬁed by summing the lengths of the intervals
removed to obtain a sum of 1. It is a closed set
where each point is an accumulation point. On
the other hand, it can be shown that the Cantor
set can be placed in one-to-one correspondence
with the points of the interval [0, 1].
(2) Any topological space homeomorphic to
the standard Cantor set in R1.
Cantor’s Theorem
If S is any set, there is
no surjection from S onto the power set P(S).
Cartan formula
A formula expressing the
relationship between values of an operation on
aproductoftermsandproductsofoperationsap-
plied to individual terms. For the mod 2 Steen-
rod algebra, the Cartan formula is given by
Sqi(xy) =

j
(Sqjx)(Sqi−jy).
The sum is ﬁnite since Sqjx = 0 when j is
greater than the degree of the cohomology class
x. A differential in a spectral sequence is an-
other example where there is a Cartan formula
(if there is a product on the spectral sequence).

categorical theory 
A consistent theory T
in a language L is categorical if all models of
T are isomorphic. Because of the Löwenheim-
Skolem Theorem, no theory with an inﬁnite
model can be categorical in this sense, since
models of different cardinalities cannot be iso-
morphic.
More generally, a consistent theory T is κ-
categorical for a cardinal κ if any two models of
T of size κ are isomorphic.

chain 
A formal ﬁnite linear combination of
simplices in a simplicial complex K with integer
coefﬁcients, or more generally with coefﬁcients
in some ring. The term is also used in more
general settings to denote an element of a chain
complex.
chain complex 
Let R be a ring (for example,
the integers). A chain complex of R-modules
consists of a family of R-modules Cn, where
n ranges over the integers (or sometimes the
non-negative integers), together with homomor-
phisms ∂n : Cn −→Cn−1 satisfying the condi-
tion: ∂n−1 ◦∂n(x) = 0 for every x in Cn.
chain equivalent complexes 
Let C = {Cn}
and C′ = {C′
n} be chain complexes with bound-
ary maps ∂ and ∂′, respectively. (See chain
complex.) A chain mapping f : C −→C′
is a chain equivalence if there is a chain map-
ping g : C′ −→C and chain homotopies from
g ◦f to the identity mapping of C and from
f ◦g to the identity mapping of C′. In this case
we say that C and C′ are chain equivalent. A
chain equivalence induces an isomorphism be-
tween the homology of C and the homology of
C′. For example, if φ : X −→Y is a homo-
topy equivalence of topological spaces, then φ
induces a chain equivalence of the singular chain
complexes of X and Y.
chain group 
Let K be a simplicial complex.
Then the nth chain group Cn(K) is the free
Abelian group constructed by taking all ﬁnite
linear combinations with integer coefﬁcients of
n-dimensional simplices of K. Similarly, if X
is a topological space, the nth singular chain
group is the free Abelian group constructed by
taking all ﬁnite linear combinations of singular
simplices, which are continuous functions from
the standard n-dimensional simplex to X.
chain homotopy 
Let C = {Cn} and C′ =
{C′
n} be chain complexes with boundary maps
∂n and ∂′
n, respectively. Let f and g be chain
mappings from C to C′. See chain complex,
chain mapping. Then a chain homotopy T from
f to g is a collection of homomorphisms Tn :
Cn −→C′
n+1 such that ∂n+1 ◦Tn +Tn−1 ◦∂n =
fn −gn. For example, a homotopy between two
maps from a topological space X to a topologi-
cal space Y induces a chain homotopy between
the induced chain maps from the singular chain
complex of X to the singular chain complex of
Y.
chain mapping 
Let C = {Cn} and C′ =
{C′
n} be chain complexes with boundary maps
∂n : Cn −→Cn−1 and ∂′
n : C′
n −→C′
n−1,
respectively. See chain complex. A chain map-
ping f : C −→C′ is a family of homomor-
phisms fn : Cn −→C′
n satisfying ∂′
n ◦fn =
fn−1 ◦∂n. For example, when φ : X −→Y is
continuous, the induced map from the singular
chain complex of X to the singular chain com-
plex of Y is a chain map.
characteristic class 
Let E −→B be a vector
bundle. A characteristic class assigns a class ξ
in the cohomology H ∗(B) of B to each vector
bundle over B so that the assignment is “pre-
dictable” or natural with respect to maps of vec-
tor bundles. That is, if the maps f : E −→E′
and g : B −→B′ form a map of vector bundles
so that E −→B is equivalent to the pullback
g∗(E′) −→B, then the class assigned to E −→
B istheimageoftheclassassignedtoE′ −→B′
under the map g∗: H ∗(B′) −→H ∗(B).
When the cohomology of the base space can
be considered as a set of numbers, the charac-
teristic class is sometimes called a characteristic
number.
Example: Stiefel-Whitney classes of a man-
ifold are characteristic classes in mod 2 coho-
mology.
characteristic function 
The characteristic
function χA of a set A of natural numbers is the
function that indicates membership in that set;
i.e., for all natural numbers n,
χA(n) =
 1
if
n ∈A
0
if
n ̸∈A.
More generally, if A is a ﬁxed universal set
and B ⊆A, then for all x ∈A,
χB(x) =
 1
if
x ∈B
0
if
x ̸∈B.

choice function
choice function 
Suppose that {Xα}α∈ is a
family of non-empty sets. A choice function is
a function f : {Xα}α∈ →
α∈ Xα such that
f (Xα) ∈Xα for all α ∈. See also Axiom of
Choice.
choice set 
Suppose that {Xα}α∈ is a family
of pairwise disjoint, non-empty sets. A choice
set is a set Y, which consists of exactly one ele-
ment from each set in the family. See also Ax-
iom of Choice.
chord 
A line segment with endpoints on a
curve (usually a circle).
Christoffel symbols 
The coefﬁcients in lo-
cal coordinates for a connection on a manifold.
If (u1, . . . , un) is a local coordinate system in
a manifold M and ∇ is a covariant derivative
operator, then the derivatives of the coordinate
ﬁelds
∂
∂uj can be written as linear combinations
of the coordinate ﬁelds:
∇∂
∂ui
∂
∂uj =
n

k=1
k
ij
∂
∂uk .
The functions k
ij(u1, . . . , un) are the Christof-
fel symbols. For the standard connection on
Euclidean space Rn the Christoffel symbols are
identically zero in rectilinear coordinates, but in
general coordinate systems they do not vanish
even in Rn.
Church-Turing Thesis 
If a partial function
ϕ on the natural numbers is computable by an
algorithm in the intuitive sense, then ϕ is com-
putable, in the formal, mathematical sense. (A
function ϕ on the natural numbers is partial if its
domain is some subset of the natural numbers.)
See computable.
This statement of the Church-Turing The-
sis is a modern day rephrasing of independent
statements by Alonzo Church and Alan Tur-
ing. Church’s Thesis, published by Church in
1936, states that the intuitively computable par-
tial functions are exactly the general recursive
functions, where the notion of general recursive
function is a formalization of computable de-
ﬁned by Gödel. Turing’s Thesis, published by
Turing in 1936, states that the intuitively com-
putable partial functions are exactly the partial
functions which are Turing computable.
The Church-Turing Thesis is a statement that
cannot be proved; rather it must be accepted or
rejected. The Church-Turing Thesis is, in gen-
eral, accepted by mathematicians; evidence in
favor of accepting the thesis is that all known
methodsofformalizingthenotionofcomputabil-
ity (see computable) have resulted in the same
class of functions; i.e., a partial function ϕ is
partial recursive if and only if it is Turing com-
putable, etc.
The most important use of the Church-Turing
Thesis is to deﬁne formally the notion of non-
computability. To show the lack of any algo-
rithm to compute a function, it sufﬁces by the
thesis to show that the function is not partial re-
cursive (or Turing computable, etc.). The con-
verseoftheChurch-TuringThesisisclearlytrue.

The curve consisting of all points in a
plane which are a ﬁxed distance (the radius of

circle) in the plane.
circle of curvature
For a plane curve, a circle
of curvature is the circle deﬁned at a point on the
curve that is both tangent to the curve and has

of curvature.

circumference of a circle 
The perimeter, or
length, of a circle.
circumference of a sphere 
The circumfer-
ence of a great circle of the sphere. See circum-
ference of a circle, great circle.
circumscribe 
Generally a plane (or solid)
ﬁgure F circumscribes a polygon (or polyhe-
dron) P if the region bounded by F contains
the region bounded by P and if every vertex of
P is incident with F. In such a case P is said
to be inscribed in F. See circumscribed circle,
for example. In speciﬁc circumstances, ﬁgures
other than polygons and polyhedra may also be
circumscribed.
circumscribed circle 
A circle containing the
interior of a polygon in its interior, in such a way
that every vertex of the polygon is on the circle;
i.e., the polygon is inscribed in the circle.
circumscribed cone 
A cone that circum-
scribes a pyramid in such a way that the base
of the cone circumscribes the base of the pyra-
mid and the vertex of the cone coincides with
the vertex of the pyramid; i.e., the pyramid is
inscribed in the cone. See circumscribe.
circumscribed cylinder 
A cylinder that cir-
cumscribes a prism in such a way that both bases
of the cylinder circumscribe a base of the prism;
i.e., the prism is inscribed in the cylinder. See
circumscribe.
circumscribed polygon 
A polygon that con-
tains the region bounded by a closed curve (usu-
ally a circle) in the region it bounds, in such a
way that every side of the polygon is tangent
to the closed curve; i.e., the closed curve is in-
scribed in the polygon.
circumscribed polyhedron 
A polyhedron
that bounds a volume containing the volume
bounded by a closed surface (usually a sphere)
in such a way that every face of the polyhedron
is tangent to the closed surface; i.e., the closed
surface is inscribed in the polyhedron. See cir-
cumscribe.
circumscribed prism 
A prism that contains
the interior of a cylinder in its interior, in such a
way that both bases of the prism circumscribe a
base of the cylinder (and so each lateral face of
the prism is tangent to the cylindrical surface);
i.e., the cylinder is inscribed in the prism. See
circumscribe.
circumscribedpyramid 
Apyramidthatcon-
tains, in its interior, the interior of a cone, in such
a way that the base of the pyramid circumscribes
the base of the cone and the vertex of the pyra-
mid coincides with the vertex of the cone; i.e.,
the cone is inscribed in the pyramid. See cir-
cumscribe.
circumscribed sphere 
A sphere that con-
tains, in its interior, the region bounded by a
polyhedron, in such a way that every vertex of
the polyhedron is on the sphere; i.e., the poly-
hedron is inscribed in the sphere. See circum-
scribe.
class 
The collection of all objects that satisfy
a given property. Every set is a class, but the
converse is not true. A class that is not a set
is called a proper class; such a class is much
“larger” than a set because it cannot be assigned
a cardinality. See Bernays-Gödel set theory.
classifying space
The classifying space of
a topological group G is a space BG with the
property that the set of equivalence classes of
vector bundles p: E −→B with G-action is in
bijective correspondence with the set [B, BG]
of homotopy classes of maps from the space B
to BG.
The space BG is unique up to homotopy, that
is, any two spaces satisfying the above property
for a ﬁxed group G are homotopy equivalent.
For G = Z/2, BZ/2 is an inﬁnite projective
space RP∞, the union of all projective spaces
RPn. Since O(1) = Z/2, all line bundles over
a space X are classiﬁed up to bundle homotopy
equivalence by homotopy classes of maps from
X into RP∞.
closed and unbounded
If κ is a non-zero
limit ordinal (in practice κ is an uncountable
cardinal), and C ⊆κ, C is closed and un-
bounded if it satisﬁes (i.) for every sequence
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

closed convex curve
α0 < α1 < · · · < αβ . . .  of elements of C
(where β < γ , for some γ < κ), the supre-
mum of the sequence, 
β<γ αβ, is in C, and
(ii.) for every α < κ, there exists β ∈C such
that β > α. A closed and unbounded subset of
κ is often called a club subset of κ.
closed convex curve 
A curve C in the plane
which is a closed curve and is the boundary of
a convex ﬁgure A. That is, the line segment
joining any two points in C lies entirely within
A. Equivalently, if A is a closed bounded con-
vex ﬁgure in the plane, then its boundary C is a
closed convex curve.
closed convex surface 
The boundary S of
a closed convex body in three-dimensional Eu-
clidean space. S is topologically equivalent to
a sphere and the line segment joining any two
points in S lies in the bounded region bounded
by S.
closed formula 
A well-formed formula ϕ of
a ﬁrst-order language such that ϕ has no free
variables.
closed half line 
A set in R of the form [a, ∞)
or (−∞, a] for some a ∈R.
closed half plane 
A subset of R2 consisting
ofastraightlineLandexactlyoneofthetwohalf
planes which L determines. Thus, any closed
half plane is either of the form {(x, y) : ax +
by ≥c} or {(x, y) : ax + by ≤c}. The sets
x ≥c and x ≤c are vertical closed half planes;
y ≥c and y ≤c are horizontal half planes.
closed map 
A function f : X →Y between
topological spaces X and Y such that, for any
closed set C ⊆X, the image set f (C) is closed
in Y.
closed set 
(1) A subset A of a topological
space, such that the complement of A is open.
See open set. For example, the sets [a, b] and
{a} are closed in the usual topology of the real
line.
(2) A closed set of ordinals is one that is
closed in the order topology. That is, C ⊆κ
is closed if, for any limit ordinal λ < κ, if C ∩λ
is unbounded in λ, then λ ∈C. Equivalently, if
{βα : α < λ} ⊆C is an increasing sequence of
length λ < κ, then
β = lim
α→λ βα ∈C .
For example, the set of all limit ordinals less
than κ is closed in κ. See also unbounded set,
stationary set.
closed surface 
A compact Hausdorff topo-
logical space with the property that each point
has a neighborhood topologically equivalent to
the plane. Thus, a closed surface is a compact
2-dimensional manifold without boundary. The
ellipsoids given by x2
a2 + y2
b2 + z2
c2 − 1 = 0 are
simple examples of closed surfaces. More gen-
erally, if f (x, y, z) is a differentiable function,
then the set of points S satisfying f (x, y, z) = 0
is a closed surface provided that S is bounded
and the gradient of f does not vanish at any point
in S.
closure of a set 
The closure of a subset A
of a topological space X is the smallest closed
set ¯A ⊆X which contains A. In other words,
¯A is the intersection of all closed sets in X that
contain A. Equivalently, ¯A = A ∪A′, where A′
is the derived set of A. For example, the closure
of the rationals in the usual topology is the whole
real line.
cluster point 
See accumulation point.
cobordism
A cobordism between two n-
dimensionalmanifoldsisan(n+1)-dimensional
manifold whose boundary is the disjoint union
of the two lower dimensional manifolds.
A
cobordism between two manifolds with a cer-
tain structure must also have that structure. For
example, if the manifolds are real oriented man-
ifolds, then the cobordism must also be a real
oriented manifold.
Example: The cylinder provides a cobordism
between the circle and itself.
Any manifold
with boundary provides a cobordism between
the boundary manifold and the empty set, which
is considered an n-manifold for all n.
cobordism class
For a manifold M, the class
of all manifolds cobordant M, that is, all man-
ifolds N for which there exists a manifold W
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

comb space
whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and
N.
cobordism group 
The cobordism classes of
n-dimensional manifolds (possibly with addi-
tionalstructure)formanAbeliangroup; theprod-
uct is given by disjoint union. The identity el-
ement is the class given by the empty set. The
inverse of the cobordism class of a manifold M
is given by reversing the orientation of M; the
manifold M × [0, 1] is a cobordism between M
and M with the reverse orientation. (See cobor-
dism class.) When studying cobordism classes
of unoriented manifolds, each manifold is its
own inverse; thus, all such cobordism classes
are 2-torsion.
Some results in geometry show that cobor-
dant manifolds may have a common geometric
or topological property, for example, two spin-
cobordant manifolds either both admit a positive
scalar curvature metric, or neither manifold can
have such a metric.
Codazzi-Mainardi equations 
A system of
partial differential equations arising in the the-
ory of surfaces. If M is a surface in R3 with
local coordinates (u1, u2), its geometric invari-
ants can be described by its ﬁrst fundamental
form gij(u1, u2) and second fundamental form
Lij(u1, u2). The Christoffel symbols k
ij are
determined by the ﬁrst fundamental form. (See
Christoffel symbols.) In order for functions gij
and Lij , i, j = 1, 2 to be the ﬁrst and second
fundamental forms of a surface, certain integra-
bility conditions (arising from equality of mixed
partial derivatives) must be satisﬁed. One set of
conditions, the Codazzi-Mainardi equations, is
given in terms of the Christoffel symbols by:
∂Lik
∂uj −∂Lij
∂uk + l
ikLlj −l
ijLlk = 0 .
codimension 
A nonnegative integer associ-
ated with a subspace W of a space V . Whenever
the space has a dimension (e.g., a topological
or a vector space) denoted by dimV , the codi-
mension of W is the defect dimV −dimW. For
example, a curve in a surface has codimension 1
(topology) and a line in space has codimension
2 (a line through the origin is a vector subspace
R of R3).
coﬁnal 
Let α, β be limit ordinals. An in-
creasing sequence ⟨ατ : τ < β⟩ is coﬁnal in α
if limτ→β ατ = α. See limit ordinal.
coﬁnality 
Let α be an inﬁnite limit ordinal.
The coﬁnality of α is the least ordinal β such
that there exists a sequence ⟨ατ : τ < β⟩ which
is coﬁnal in α. See coﬁnal.
coﬁnite subset 
A subset A of an inﬁnite set
S, such that S\A is ﬁnite. Thus, the set of all in-
tegers with absolute value at least 13 is a coﬁnite
subset of Z.
coimage 
Let C be an additive category and
f ∈HomC(X, Y) amorphism. Ifi ∈HomC(X′,
X) is a morphism such that f i = 0, then a coim-
age of f is a morphism g ∈ HomC(X, Y ′) such
that gi = 0. See additive category.
coinﬁnite subset
A subset A if an inﬁnite set
S such that S\A is inﬁnite. Thus, the set of all
even integers is a coinﬁnite subset of Z.
collapse
A collapse of a complex K is a ﬁ-
nite sequence of elementary combinatorial op-
erations which preserves the homotopy type of
the underlying space.
For example, let K be a simplicial complex
of dimension n of the form K = L ∪σ ∪τ,
where L is a subcomplex of K, σ is an open
n-simplex of K, and τ is a free face of σ. That
is, τ is an n−1 dimensional face of σ and is not
the face of any other n-dimensional simplex.
The operation of replacing the complex L ∪
σ ∪τ with the subcomplex L is called an ele-
mentary collapse of K and is denoted K ↘L.
A collapse is a ﬁnite sequence of elementary
collapses K ↘L1 · · · ↘Lm.
When K is a CW complex, ball pairs of the
form (Bn, Bn−1) are used in place of the pair
(σ, τ).
collection 
See set.
collinear
Points that lie on the same line or
on planes that share a common line.
comb space
A topological subspace of the
plane R2 which resembles a comb with inﬁnitely
many teeth converging to one end. For example,

the subset of the unit square [0, 1]2 given by
({0} × [0, 1])∪
({1
k : k ≥ 1} × [0, 1]) ∪([0, 1] × {0})
is a comb space. The subspace obtained from
this set by deleting the line segment {0} × (0, 1)
is an example of a connected set that is not path
connected.
common tangent 
A line that is tangent to
two circles.

compact 
(1) The property of a topological
space X that every cover of X by open sets (ev-
ery collection {Xα} of open sets with X ⊂∪Xα)
contains a ﬁnite subcover (a ﬁnite collection
Xα1, . . . , Xαn with X ⊂∪Xαi ).
(2) A compact topological space.
compactcomplexmanifold 
Acomplexman-
ifold which is compact in the complex topology.
A common example is a Riemann surface (1-
dimensional complex manifold): the (Riemann)
sphere is compact, unlike the sphere with a point
removed. Thespherewithanopendiskremoved
is also compact in the complex topology, but
strictly speaking it is not a complex manifold
(some points do not lie in an open disk): it is
known as a manifold with boundary. See com-
plex manifold.
compactiﬁcation 
A compactiﬁcation of a
topological space X is a pair, (Y, f ), where Y is
a compact Hausdorff space and f is a homeo-
morphism from X onto a dense subset of Y. A
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a space to
have a compactiﬁcation is that it be completely
regular. See also one-point compactiﬁcation,
Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation.
compact leaf
A concept arising in the the-
ory of foliations. A foliated manifold is an n-
dimensional manifold M, partitioned into a fam-
ily of disjoint, path-connected subsets Lα such
that there is a covering of M by open sets Ui and
homeomorphisms hi : Ui −→Rn taking each
component of Lα∩Ui onto a parallel translate of
the subspace Rk. Each Lα is called a leaf, and it
is a compact leaf if it is compact as a subspace.
compact-open topology
The topology on the
spaceofcontinuousfunctionsfromatopological
space X to a topological space Y, generated by
taking as a subbasis all sets of the form {f :
f (C) ⊆U}, where C ⊆X is compact and
U ⊆Y is open. If Y is a metric space, this
topology is the same as that given by uniform
convergence on compact sets.
comparability of cardinal numbers
The
proposition that, for any two cardinals α, β, ei-
ther α ≤β or β ≤α.
compass
An instrument for constructing
points at a certain distance from a ﬁxed point
and for measuring distance between points.
compatible (elements of a partial ordering)
Two elements p and q of a partial order (P, ≤)
such that there is an r ∈P with r ≤p and
r ≤q. Otherwise p and q are incompatible.
In the special case of a Boolean algebra, p
and q are compatible if and only if p ∧q ̸= 0.
In a tree, however, p and q are compatible if and
only if they are comparable: p ≤q or q ≤p.
complementary angles
Two angles are com-
plementary if their sum is a right angle.
complement of a set
If X is a set contained in
a universal set U, the complement of X, denoted
X′, is the set of all elements in U that do not
belong to X. More precisely, X′ = {u ∈U :
u /∈X}.

completely additive function 
An arithmetic
function f having the property that f (mn) =
f (m) + f (n) for all positive integers m and
n. (See arithmetic function.) For example, the
function f (n) = log n is completely additive.
The values of a completely additive function de-
pend only on its values at primes, since f (pi) =
i · f (p). See also additive function.
completelymultiplicativefunction 
Anarith-
metic function f having the property that
f (mn) = f (m) · f (n) for all positive integers
m and n. (See arithmetic function.) For exam-
ple, λ, Liouville’s function, is completely multi-
plicative. Thevaluesofacompletelymultiplica-
tive function depend only on its values at primes,
since f (pi) = (f (p))i. See also multiplicative
function, strongly multiplicative function.
completely normal topological space 
A
topological space X such that every subspace
of X is normal. In particular, X itself must
be normal, and since normality is not generally
preserved in subspaces, complete normality is
stronger than normality. Complete normality is
equivalent to requiring that, for all subsets A and
B of X, if ¯A ∩B = A ∩¯B = ∅, then there are
disjoint open sets U and V with A ⊆U and
B ⊆V .
completelyregulartopologicalspace 
Atopo-
logical space X such that points are closed and
points and closed sets can be separated by con-
tinuous functions. That is, for each x ∈X, the
singleton {x} is closed, and for all closed C ⊆X
with x /∈C, there is a continuous f : X →
[0, 1] such that f (x) = 0 and f (c) = 1 for all
c ∈C.
complete metric space 
A topological space
X with metric d such that any Cauchy sequence
in X converges. That is, if {xn : n ∈N} ⊆X
is such that for any ϵ > 0 there is an N with
d(xn, xm) < ϵ for any n, m ≥N, then there is
an x ∈X with xn →x. For example, each Eu-
clidean n-space Rn is a complete metric space.
complete set of logical connectives 
A set
C of logical connectives such that, given any
well-formed propositional (sentential) formula
ϕ, whose logical connectives are from among
the usual set {¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔} of logical con-
nectives, there is a well-formed propositional
formula ψ, whose logical connectives are from
C, such that ϕ and ψ are logically equivalent.
Examples of complete sets of logical con-
nectives include {¬, ∧, ∨}, {¬, ∧}, {¬, ∨}, and
{¬, →}. The set {∧, →} is not a complete set
of logical connectives.
complete theory 
Let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage and let T be a (closed) theory of L. The
theory T is complete if, for all sentences σ, ei-
ther σ ∈T or (¬σ) ∈T .
If T is simply a collection of sentences, then
T is complete if for all sentences σ, either σ is
a logical consequence of T or (¬σ) is a logical
consequence of T . Equivalently, T is complete
if, for all sentences σ, either σ is provable from
T or (¬σ) is provable from T .
Let A be a structure for L. The theory of A
(denoted T h(A)), the set of all sentences of L
which are true in A, is a complete theory.
complex
A collection of cells with the prop-
erties: (i.) if C is a cell in the complex, then
every face of C is in the complex; and (ii.) every
two cells in the complex have disjoint interiors.
complex analytic ﬁber bundle
A ﬁber bun-
dle f : F →X where F and X are complex
manifolds and f is an analytic map. See ﬁber
bundle.
complex analytic structure
On a real differ-
ential manifold M an integrable complex struc-
ture on the tangent bundle T M; namely, the data
of an invertible linear map Jp : TpM →TpM
on each tangent space at p ∈M, such that
J 2
p = −Identity, which varies smoothly with
p and is integrable, i.e., admits an atlas with
constant transition functions. Without the inte-
grability condition, the data deﬁne an “almost-
complex structure” on M.
complex conjugate bundle
For a complex
vector bundle f : V →M, the conjugate bun-
dle V is deﬁned by taking the complex conjugate
f α of each local map fα : Cn × Uα ∼= V |Uα =
f −1(Uα) that deﬁnes the bundle restricted to
Uα, for a suitable covering Uα of M.

complex dimension
complex dimension 
(1) For a vector space X,
the dimension of X, considered as a vector space
over the ﬁeld C of complex numbers, as opposed
to the real dimension, which is the dimension of
X as a vector space over the real numbers R.

plexdimensionofthetangentspaceTpM ateach

(3) The dimension of a complex; i.e., the
highest of the dimensions of the cells that form

complex line bundle 
A complex vector bun-
dle whose ﬁbers have dimension 1. See complex
vector bundle.
complex manifold 
A set of points M which
can be covered with a family of subsets {Uα}α∈A
i.e., M = 
α∈A Uα, each of which is isomor-
phic to an open ball in complex n-space:
{(z1, . . . , zn) ∈Cn : |z1|2 + . . . + |zn|2 = 1},
for a ﬁxed non-negative integer n.
complex of lines 
In projective geometry, a
line complex is a subvariety of the Grassman-
nian Gr(2, 4) of all lines in (complex) projective
3-space CP3, which is the set of 2-dimensional
subspaces of a 4-dimensional complex vector
space. Gr(2, 4) is a quadric hypersurface in
CP5, thus an example of line complex is a “lin-
ear line complex”, the intersection of Gr(2, 4)
with a hyperplane, e.g., all the lines in P3 that
meet a given plane.
complex plane 
The topological space, de-
noted C or C, consisting of the set of complex
numbers, i.e., numbers of the form a+bi, where
a and b are real numbers and i2 = −1. C is
usually visualized as the set of pairs (a, b) and
hence the terminology plane.
The term extended complex plane refers to
C, together with a point at inﬁnity and neigh-
borhoods of the form {z : ∥z∥> r} for real
numbers r.
complex sphere

complex torus 
The n-dimensional compact
complex analytic manifold Cn/, where n is
a positive integer and  a complete lattice in
Cn. In dimension 1, the complex tori C/(Zω1+
Zω2), where ω1 and ω2 are complex numbers
independent over R, are all algebraic varieties,
also called elliptic curves.
complex vector bundle 
A complex vector
bundle (of dimension n) on a differentiable man-
ifold M is a manifold E, given by a family of
complex vector spaces {Ep}p∈M, with a trivial-
ization over an open covering {Uα}α∈A of M,
namely diffeomorphisms φα : Cn × Uα →
{Ep}p∈Uα . If M and E are complex analytic
manifolds and a trivialization exists with φα bi-
holomorphic maps, the bundle is said to be com-
plex analytic.
composite 
See composite number.
composite number 
An integer, other than
−1, 0, and 1, that is not a prime number. That
is, a nonzero integer is composite if it has more
than two positive divisors. For example, 6 is
composite since the positive divisors of 6 are
1, 2, 3, and 6. Just as prime numbers are usu-
ally assumed to be positive integers, a compos-
ite number is usually assumed to be positive as
well.
composition of functions 
Suppose that f :
X →Y and g : Y →Z are functions. The
composition gf : X →Z is the function con-
sisting of all ordered pairs (x, z) such that there
exists an element y ∈Y with (x, y) ∈f and
(y, z) ∈g. See function.
computable
Let N be the set of natural num-
bers.
Intuitively, a function f : N →N is
computable if there is an algorithm, or effec-
tive procedure, which, given n ∈N as input,
produces f (n) as output in ﬁnitely many steps.
There are no limitations on the amount of time
or “memory” (i.e., “scratch paper”) necessary
to compute f (n), except that they be ﬁnite. If
f : Nk →N, then f is computable is deﬁned
analogously.

computable
A function ϕ on N is partial if its domain
is some subset of N; i.e., ϕ may not be deﬁned
on all inputs. A partial function ϕ on N is in-
tuitively computable if there is an algorithm, or
effective procedure, which given n ∈N as input,
produces ϕ(n) as output in ﬁnitely many steps
if n ∈ dom(ϕ), and runs forever otherwise.
For example, the function f (n, m) = n + m
is intuitively computable, as is the function f
which, on input n ∈N, produces as output the
nth prime number. The function ϕ which, on
input n ∈N, produces the output 1 if there exists
a consecutive run of exactly n 5s in the decimal
expansion of π, and is undeﬁned otherwise, is
an intuitively computable partial function.
The notion of computability has a formal
mathematical deﬁnition; in order to say that a
function is not computable, one must have a for-
mal mathematical deﬁnition. There have been
several formalizations of the intuitive notion of
computability, all of which generate the same
class of functions. Given here is the formaliza-
tion of Turing computable. A second formal-
ization is given in the deﬁnition of a partial re-
cursive function. See partial recursive function.
Other formalizations include that of register ma-
chine 
computability 
(Shepherdson–Sturgis,
1963), general recursive functions (Gödel,
1934), andλ-deﬁnablefunctions(Church, 1930).
It has been proved that, for any partial function
ϕ, ϕ is Turing computable if and only if ϕ is
partial recursive, if and only if ϕ is register ma-
chine computable, etc. See also Church-Turing
Thesis. Thus, the term computable can (math-
ematically) mean computable in any such for-
malization.
A set A of natural numbers is computable if
its characteristic function is computable; i.e., the
function
χA(n) =
 1
if
n ∈A
0
if
n ̸∈A
is recursive.
A partial function ϕ on N is Turing com-
putable if there is some Turing machine that
computes it. The notion of Turing machine was
formalized by Alan Turing in his 1936 Proceed-
ings of the London Mathematical Society paper.
A Turing machine consists of a bi-inﬁnite
tape, which is divided into cells, a reading head
which can scan one cell of the tape at a time, a
ﬁnite tape alphabet S = {s0, s1, . . . , sn} of sym-
bols which can be written on the tape, and a ﬁnite
setQ = {q0, q1, . . . , qm}ofpossiblestates. The
sets S and Q have the properties that S ∩Q = ∅,
{1, B} ⊆S (where B stands for “blank”), and
q0 ∈Q is the designated initial state. A Turing
machine which is in state qj reading symbol si
on its tape may perform one of three possible
actions: it may write over the symbol it is scan-
ning, move the read head right (R), and go into
another (possibly the same) state; it may write
over the symbol it is scanning, move the read
head left (L), and go into another (possibly the
same) state; or it may halt.
The action of the Turing machine is governed
by a Turing program, given by a transition func-
tionδ, whosedomainissomesubsetofQ×S and
whose range is a subset of the set Q×S×{R, L}.
If δ(q, a) = (ˆq, ˆa, m), then the action of the ma-
chine is as follows. If the machine is in state q,
reading symbol a on the tape, then it replaces a
by ˆa on the tape, moves the read head one cell
to the right if m = R, moves the read head one
cell to the left if m = L, and goes into state ˆq.
The Turing program halts if the machine is in a
state q, reading a symbol a, and the transition
function is undeﬁned on (q, a).
A Turing machine computes a partial func-
tion as follows: given input x1, . . . , xn, the tape
is initially set to
. . . B1x1+1B1x2+1B . . . B1xn+1B . . . ,
where 1k indicates a string of k 1s, one symbol
1 per cell, . . . B1x1+1 indicates that all cells to
the left of the initial 1 on the tape are blank, and
1xn+1B . . . indicates that all cells to the right
of the last 1 on the tape are blank. The read-
ing head is positioned on the leftmost 1 on the
tape, and the machine is set to the initial state q0.
The output of the function (if any) is the number
of 1s on the tape when the machine halts, after
executing the program, if it ever halts.
The following is a Turing machine program
which computes the function f (x1, x2) = x1 +
x2, thus showing that f is Turing computable.
The idea is that, given input
. . . B1x1+1B1x2+1B . . . ,
the machine replaces the middle blank B by a
1 (instructions 1 – 2), moves to the leftmost 1

(instructions 3 – 4), and then erases three 1s
(instructions 5 – 7).
• δ(q0, 1) = (q0, 1, R)
• δ(q0, B) = (q1, 1, L)
• δ(q1, 1) = (q1, 1, L)
• δ(q1, B) = (q2, B, R)
• δ(q2, 1) = (q3, B, R)
• δ(q3, 1) = (q4, B, R)
• δ(q4, 1) = (q5, B, R)
Other formalizations of the Turing machine
exist which are slight variations of those given

ing “with the same center”. See concentric cir-
cles, concentric cylinders.

Circles that lie in the same
plane and have the same center.

cone
A solid in R3, bounded by a region in
a plane (the base) and the surface formed by
straight lines (the generators) which join points
of the boundary of the base to a ﬁxed point (the
vertex) not in the plane of the base. The coni-
cal surface described by a moving straight line
passing through the vertex and tracing any ﬁxed
curve, such as a circle, ellipse, etc., at another
point is sometimes also called a cone. A cone
may be viewed as a quadratic surface, whose
equation is Ax2 + By2 + Cz2 = 0 (A, B, C ̸=
0). When A = B, it is a right circular cone
(also called a cone of revolution); if A̸=B, it is
an oblique circular cone.
cone extension
A deformation of a cone. For
a given direction at a point, it represents the in-
crease of length per unit length of arc, i.e., the
unit vector in that direction. For example, let
I k (I = [−1, 1]) be a k-dimensional convex
cell which is a cone of the boundary of I k from
its center 0. Each point x of I k can be written
uniquely as x = t · u for 0 < t ≤1 where u be-
longs to the boundary of I k. A cone extension
results when a piecewise linear embedding F
from the boundary of I m to the boundary of I n is
extended to a piecewise linear embedding F be-
tween the two convex cells by setting F(0) = 0
and F(t · u) = t · f (u) for t · u ∈I m −{0}.
conformal arc element
Let Sn be a con-
formal space of dimension n (an n-dimensional
sphere represented as the quadric hypersurface
Sn: x 2
1 +x 2
2 +...+x 2
n −2x0x∞= 0 in an (n+1)-
dimensional real projective space P n+1, where
the (xi) are homogeneous coordinates in P n+1).
The conformal arc element of a curve is given
by the Frenet-Serret formula for the curve. For
example, let S be a surface in a 3-dimensional
projective space and let A be a point of S associ-
ated with all the frames [A, A1, A2, A3] where
A1, A2, A3 are points of the tangent plane to S
at A. The Frenet-Serret formula for S3 is given
by the following matrix:

where dα is the conformal arc element, κ is the

α is the Pfafﬁan form that depends on
the principal parameters determining the origin
A and the secondary parameters determining the
frame.
conformal correspondence
A diffeomor-
phism between two surfaces, whose derivative
is a linear map.
Angles, but not necessarily
lengths, are preserved under conformal corre-
spondence. Also called conformal mapping.
conformal curvature
Let I be an open inter-
val of R. Let α : I →R3 be a curve parameter-
ized by arc length s (s ∈I) and α′′ (s) ̸= 0. For
each value of s, let t, n, and b be vector ﬁelds

along α deﬁned by
t(s) = α′′(s), n(s) =
α′′ (s)
∥α′′ (s)∥
and
b (s) = t (s) × n (s) .
The derivative t
′ (s) = κ (s) n (s) yields the
function κ : I →R, the geometric entity which
is the curvature of α in a neighborhood of S.
Physically, curvature measures how much the
curve differs (bends) from a straight line. This
deﬁnitionisgeneralizableton-dimensionalcon-
formal space, where the conformal curvature of
a curve can be derived from the Frenet-Serret
apparatus. The concept of curvature associated
with a moving frame along a curve was intro-
duced by F. Frenet in 1847 and independently
by J.A. Serret in 1851.
conformal differential geometry 
The study
of geometric quantities that are invariant un-
der conformal transformations, using methods
ofmathematicalanalysissuchasdifferentialcal-
culus.
conformal equivalence 
Let w = f (z) be a
function that conformally maps a domain D on
the complex z-sphere homeomorphically onto a
domain △ on the complex w-sphere. Then △ is
conformally equivalent to D.
conformal geometry 
The study of proper-
ties of ﬁgures that are invariant under conformal
transformations. Let Sn be an n-dimensional
sphere, P n+1 be an (n + 1)-dimensional pro-
jective space, and let M(n) be the group of all
projective transformations of P n+1 which leave
Sn invariant. Then (Sn, M(n)) is a conformal
geometry or a Möbius geometry.
conformal invariant 
A geometric quantity
preserved by conformal mappings.
conformal mapping 
A conformal mapping
or correspondence between two surfaces S and
S∗ is a diffeomorphism of S onto S∗ such that
the angle between any two curves at an arbitrary
pointx onS isequaltotheanglebetweenthecor-
responding curves on S∗. Conformal mappings
are more general than isomorphisms which pre-
serve both angles and distances. In R3, con-
formal mappings are those obtained by trans-
lations, reﬂections in planes, and inversions in
spheres. A one-to-one conformal mapping is a
conformal transformation. In R3 the conformal
transformations form the 10-parameter confor-
mal group. In 1779, Lagrange had obtained all
the conformal transformations of a portion of
the earth’s surface onto a plane area that trans-
formed latitude and longitude circles into circu-
lar arcs.
conformal torsion 
Let I be an open interval
of R. Let α : I →R3 be a curve parameterized
by arc length S (S ∈I) and αsf ′′ (s) ̸= 0. For
each value of S, let t, n, and b be vector ﬁelds
along α deﬁned by
t (s) = αsf ′ (s) , n (s) =
αsf ′′ (s)
αsf ′′ (s)
 ,
and
b (s) = t (s) × n (s) .
The derivative bsf ′ (s) = τ (s) n (s) yields the
function τ : I →R , a geometric entity which is
the torsion of α in the neighborhood of s. It mea-
sures the arc-rate of turning of b. Generalizing
to n-dimensional conformal space, the confor-
mal torsion of a curve can be derived from the
Frenet-Serret apparatus. The concept of torsion
associated with a moving frame along a curve
was introduced by F. Frenet in 1847 and inde-
pendently by J.A. Serret in 1851.
congruence of lines 
Refers to a set of lines
in projective, afﬁne, or Euclidean space depend-
ing on a set of parameters. For example, let P 5
be a 5-dimensional projective space, and Q a
hyperquadrix deﬁned by the equation p01p23 −
p02p13 + p03p12 = 0, where the pij are ho-
mogeneous coordinates of P 5. Then we deﬁne
a congruence of lines as a set of 2-parameter
straight lines corresponding to a surface of two
dimensions on Q in P 5. The theory of congru-
ences is an important part of projective differ-
ential geometry. See also congruent objects in
space.

such that E is contained in the class of mor-
phisms from A to B, and (ii.) for all morphisms
f, f ′, g, g′ of C, if f ∼f ′ and g ∼g′, then
f ◦g ∼f ′ ◦g′ (assuming f ◦g and f ′ ◦g′
exist).
congruent objects in plane 
Two objects P
and P ∗ in R2 are congruent if there exists a rigid
motion α : R2 →R2 such that α(P) = P ∗.
congruent objects in space 
Two objects S
and S∗ in R3 are congruent if there exists a rigid
motion α : R3 →R3 such that α(S) = S∗.
conic section 
A geometric locus obtained by
taking planar sections of a conical surface (i.e.,
of a circular cone formed from the rotation of
one line around another, provided the lines are
not parallel or orthogonal). These sections do
not pass through the intersection point of the two
lineswhichproducethecircularcone. Theconic
section is thus a plane curve in R3 generated by a
point that moves so that the ratio of its distance
from a ﬁxed point to its distance from a ﬁxed
line is constant. It can be one of three types:
an ellipse (where the intersecting plane meets
all generators of the cone in the points of only
one convex half-cone), a parabola (where the
intersectingplaneisparalleltooneofthetangent
planes to the cone going off to inﬁnity), or a
hyperbola (where the intersecting plane meets
both half-cones).
conical helix
A space curve that lies on the
surface of a cone and cuts all the generators at a
constant angle. See cone.
conical surface
A surface of revolution of
constant curvature in R3. It can be generated
by a straight line that connects a ﬁxed point (the
vertex) with each point of a ﬁxed curve (the di-
rectrix). The conical surface consists of two
concave pieces positioned symmetrically about
the vertex. It is quadric if the directrix is a conic.
A circular conical surface is one whose directrix
is a circle and whose vertex is on the line per-
pendicular to the plane of the circle and passing
through the center of the circle.

where each Aij, 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi, is
either a sentence symbol or the negation of a
sentence symbol. Every well-formed proposi-
tional formula is logically equivalent to one in
conjunctive normal form.
For example, if A, B, and C are sentence
symbols, then the well-formed formula ((A →
B) →C) is logically equivalent to (¬A∨¬B ∨
C) ∧(A ∨¬B ∨C) ∧(A ∨B ∨C), which is a
formula in conjunctive normal form.
connected
A subset A of a topological space
X is connected if it is connected as a subspace
of X. In other words, A is connected if there do
not exist nonempty disjoint sets U and V , which
are relatively open in A such that A = U ∪V .
That is, there are no disjoint open sets U and V
in X with U ∩A ̸= ∅, V ∩A ̸= ∅, and A =
(U ∩A)∪(V ∩A) = (U ∪V )∩A. For example,
(0, 1) is connected in R, while [0, 0.5)∪(0.5, 1]
is not, because [0, 0.5) and (0.5, 1] are relatively
open in that space.
connected component
In a topological space
X, the connected component of x ∈X is the
largest connected A ⊆X which contains x.
Equivalently, A is the union of all connected sets
in X which contain x. Any space can be par-
titioned into its connected components, which
must be disjoint.

connected sum
An n-dimensional manifold
formed from n-dimensional manifolds M1 and
M2 (and denoted M1#M2) as follows: Let B1
and B2 be closed n-dimensional balls in M1
and M2, respectively. Let h : S1 −→S2 be a
homeomorphism of the boundary sphere of B1
totheboundaryofB2. ThenM1#M2 istheunion
of M1 minus the interior of B1 and M2 minus the
interior of B2, with each x in S1 identiﬁed with
h(x) in S2. The resulting space is a manifold;
different choices of balls and homeomorphisms
may give rise to inequivalent manifolds.
connected topological space
A topological
space X such that there do not exist nonempty
disjoint open sets U and V such that X = U ∪V .
Equivalently, the only subsets of X that are both
open and closed are ∅and X itself.
connective ﬁber space
A ﬁber space that
cannot be represented as the sum of two non-
empty disjoint open-closed subsets. Connectiv-
ity is preserved under homeomophisms.
conservative
Let L1 and L2 be ﬁrst order
languages with L1 ⊆L2; let T1 be a theory of
L1 and T2 be a theory of L2. The theory T2 is a
conservative extension of T1 if
(i.) T2 is an extension of T1; i.e., T1 ⊆T2,
and
(ii.) for every sentence σ of L1, if σ is a
theorem of T2 (T2 ⊢σ), then σ is a theorem of
T1 (T1 ⊢σ).
consistent
Let L be a ﬁrst order language and
let  be a set of well-formed formulas of L. The
set  is consistent if it is not inconsistent; i.e., if
there does not exist a formula α such that both α
and (¬α) are theorems of . If  is consistent,
then there must exist a formula α such that α is
not a theorem of . Note that  is consistent
if and only if  is satisﬁable, by soundness and
completeness of ﬁrst order logic.
If  is a set of sentences and ϕ is a well-
formed formula, then ϕ is consistent with  if
 has a model that is also a model of ϕ.
consistent axioms
A set of axioms such that
there is no statement A such that both A and its
negation are provable from the set of axioms.
Informally, a collection of axioms is consistent
if there is a model for the axioms; the axioms of
group theory are consistent as G = {e}, where ·
is deﬁned on G by e · e = e, is a model of these
axioms.
In the case of formal systems, Gödel’s Se-
cond Incompleteness Theorem states, roughly,
that the consistency of any sufﬁciently strong
theory cannot be proved in that theory; for ex-
ample, it is not possible to prove the consistency
of Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory from the
axioms of ZF. Consequently, only a relative
notion of consistency can be considered; i.e.,
given a set  of axioms of a formal system and
a statement A in the language of that system,
one asks whether  ∪{A} is consistent, assum-
ing that  is consistent. For example, Gödel
proved in 1936 that, assuming ZF is consistent,
so is ZFC, where ZFC is ZF set theory to-
gether with the Axiom of Choice. In addition,
Cohen proved in 1963 that, assuming ZF is con-
sistent, so is ZF + ¬AC, where ZF + ¬AC is
ZF set theory together with the negation of the
Axiom of Choice.

contact element
In the Euclidean plane R2,
an ordered pair (p, ℓ) consisting of a point p and
a line ℓcontaining the point p. More generally,
a contact element in a smooth n-dimensional
manifold M is a pair (p, H) consisting of a point
p in M and an n−1-dimensional plane H in the
tangent space at p. The contact elements in M
form a (2n−1)-dimensional manifold which has

contact form
A one-form ω on a smooth
(2n+1)-dimensional manifold M such that ω∧
(dω)n ̸= 0 everywhere on M. At each point p
in M, the kernel K(p) of ω(p) is a plane of
dimension 2n in the tangent space at p. The

condition on ω is equivalent to the statement:
for any vector V ∈K(p) there is a W such that
dω(V, W) ̸= 0. Darboux’s Theorem says that
it is always possible to ﬁnd local coordinates
(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn, z) in which ω = dz −

contactmanifold 
Theodd-dimensionalcoun-
terpart of a symplectic manifold. A contact
manifold is a smooth (2n+1)-dimensional man-
ifold M together with a one-form ω on M such
that ω∧(dω)n ̸= 0 everywhere on M. There is a
unique vector ﬁeld V on M, called the character-
istic vector ﬁeld, determined by two conditions:
(i.) ω(V ) = 1 and
(ii.) dω(V, W) = 0 for all W.
In special local coordinates, this is the vector
ﬁeld ∂
∂z.
An example of a contact manifold is the unit
sphere S2n+1, viewed as a submanifold of com-
plex n-dimensional space. The characteristic
vector ﬁeld is the ﬁeld of unit vectors tangent
to the great circles which form the ﬁbers of the
Hopf ﬁbration π : S2n+1 −→CPn of the sphere
over complex projective space. π is the map
that takes a point in the sphere to the complex 1-
dimensional subspace containing the point. The
1-form ω is given by the formula
ω(W) =< V, W > ,
where <, > is the Euclidean inner product.
contactmetricstructure 
ARiemannianmet-
ric g on a manifold M of dimension 2n + 1 and
a contact form η which are compatible. The
contact form η is a 1-form on M which satisﬁes
the condition η ∧(dη)n ̸= 0 at every point. η
determines a subspace K(p) of codimension 1
in the tangent space Mp to M at the point p,
as well as a vector ξ transverse to K(p) and
determined by the conditions: η(ξ) = 1 and
dη(V, ξ) = 0 for all V in K(p). The met-
ric g must make ξ(p) a unit vector, orthogo-
nal to K(p). For X and Y in K(p), the metric
satisﬁes dη(X, Y) = g(X, φY), where φ(p) :
Mp →Mp is a linear transformation satisfying
φ2(V ) = −V on K(p) and φ(ξ) = 0. More
precisely, φ is a tensor ﬁeld on M of type (1, 1)
satisfying φ2 = −I + η ⊗ξ.
contact structure 
A speciﬁcation of a (2n)-
dimensional plane K(p) in the tangent space
of a manifold M of dimension 2n + 1, at each
point p, in such a way that in some open set U
around p there is a smooth, one-form ω such that
K(q) is the kernel of ω(q) for every q. The one-
form is required to satisfy the non-degeneracy
condition: ω ∧(dω)n ̸= 0 for all q in U. The
form ω is called a local contact form. On the
overlap of two such open sets, the local forms
agree up to a non-vanishing scalar multiple. If
the form can be globally deﬁned, then M is a
contact manifold.
An example of a contact structure is given
by the manifold of straight lines in the plane
R2. Local coordinates (x, y, z)  are given by
letting (x, y) be the point of contact and 0 <
z < π the angle between the line and a hori-
zontal line. (Different coordinates are chosen if
the line is horizontal.) The 1-form is given by
ω(x, y, z) = sin(z)dx −cos(z)dy. This 1-form
cannot be deﬁned globally.

where each ai is a real number. If the expres-
sion consists of only a ﬁnite number of fractions,
the expression is called a ﬁnite continued frac-
tion and is (obviously) a rational number. See

continuous function
A function f from a
topological space X to a topological space Y
such that, for each open U ⊆Y, the set f −1(U)
is open in X. For functions on the real line, this
is equivalent to requiring that, for any ϵ > 0,
there exists a δ > 0 such that |f (x)−f (y)| < ϵ
whenever |x −y| < δ.

convex closure
continuous geometry 
An orthomodular lat-
tice, i.e., a complete and complemented modu-
lar lattice L such that given any element x of
L and any subset W of L which is well or-
dered with respect to the ordering in L, then
x ∩ sup w = sup(a ∩w), where w ∈W. The
concept of a continuous geometry was intro-
duced by John von Neumann. When the dimen-
sion is discrete, continuous geometry contains
projective geometry as a special case. Gener-
ally, however the lattices have continuous di-
mension.
continuum hypothesis 
The statement
2ℵ0 = ℵ1 .
(It is not possible to prove this statement or its
negation in Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the
Axiom of Choice.)
contractible topological space 
A topologi-
cal space X that can be shrunk to a point. More
precisely, X is contractible if there is a continu-
ous function c : X×[0, 1] −→X (called a con-
traction) such that c(x, 0) = x for all x in X, and
for some p in X, c(x, 1) = p for all x. The n-
dimensional Euclidean spaces are contractible,
while any space with a nonzero homology or ho-
motopy group in a positive dimension gives an
example of a non-contractible space.
contraction 
If X is a subspace of Y, then a
contraction of X in Y is a continuous function
c : X × [0, 1] −→Y such that c(x, 0) = x for
all x in X, and for some p in Y, c(x, 1) = p for
all x in X. See contractible topological space.

convergent sequence 
A sequence of points
{xn : n ∈N} in a topological space X converges
to x ∈X if, for any open set U containing x,
there is an N ∈N with xn ∈U for all n ≥N. A
sequence is convergent if it converges to some
x ∈X. For example, the sequence of reals { 1
n}
converges to 0, while the sequence {n} does not
converge.
convex 
(1) A non-empty subset X of Rn such
that, for any elements x, y ∈X, and any number
c such that 0 ≤c ≤ 1, the element cx +(1−c)y
of Rn belongs to X. In R2, for example, a set
is convex if it contains the line segment joining
any two of its points. See also convex closure.
(2) A real function f (x) in an interval I such
that the graph of f lies nowhere above its secant
line in any subinterval of I.
convex body 
A bounded, closed, convex set
(ﬁnite or inﬁnite) that has interior points. See
convex.
convex cell
The convex closure of a ﬁnite
set of points P = {p0, p1, ..., pk}, in an n-
dimensional afﬁne space An. When p0, ..., pk
are independent, it is a k-dimensional simplex
with vertices p0, ..., pk.
convex closure
For any subset X of an n-
dimensional afﬁne space An, there exists a min-
imal convex set that contains X. This set, which
is the intersection of all the convex sets that con-
tain X, is the convex closure of X. In Rn, the
convex closure of a set X is the set of possible
locations of the center of gravity of mass which
can be distributed in different ways in the mini-
mal convex set containing X. Each point of the

convex cone
convex closure is the center of gravity of a mass
concentrated at not more than n + 1 points.
For a subset X of An, X is convex if the seg-
ment joining two arbitrary points of X is con-
tained in X.
convex cone 
A convex body consisting of
half-lines emanating from a point (the apex of
the cone). The surface of a convex cone is some-
times called a convex cone.
convex cylinder 
A cylinder that lies entirely
on one side of any tangent plane at a point of the
cylinder. See cylinder.
convex hull 
The smallest convex set contain-
ing a given subset X of a Euclidean space. The
convex hull of X can be constructed by forming
the intersection of all half-planes containing X.
See also convex closure.
convex polygon 
A polygon in R2 with the
property that each of its interior angles (the an-
gles made by adjacent sides of the polygon and
contained within the polygon) is less than or
equal to 180 degrees. A convex polygon always
has an interior.
convex polyhedral cone 
A convex cone in
R3 whichistheintersectionoflinearhalf-spaces.

convex polyhedron 
The convex closure of
a ﬁnite number of points in Rn; that is, the
boundedintersectionofaﬁnitenumberofclosed
half-spaces. In R3, it is a solid bounded by plane
polygons, which lies entirely on one side of any
plane containing one of its faces. Any plane sec-
tion of a convex polyhedron is a convex polygon.
See convex closure, convex polygon.
coordinate 
See coordinate system. In R2, a
coordinate is one of an ordered pair of numbers
that locates the position of a point in the plane.
coordinate axis 
One of ﬁnitely many com-
ponents of a reference system which provides
a one-to-one correspondence between the ele-
ments of a set (on a plane or a surface, in a
space, or on a manifold) with the numbers used
to specify their position. In Rn, it is part of an
orthogonal frame which determines the rectan-
gular coordinates of each point in the space. In
R2 a coordinate axis is a line along which or
parallel to which a coordinate is measured.
coordinate bundle 
Let E, B, F be topologi-
cal spaces and p : E →B be a continuous map.
Let G be an effective left topological transfor-
mation group of F. If there exists an open cover-
ing {Uα}α∈ of B, and a homeomorphism φα :
Uα × F ≈p−1(Uα) for each α ∈, then the
system (E, p, B, F, G, Uα, φα) is a coordinate
bundle if it has the following three properties:
(i.) pφα(b, y) = b (b ∈Uα, y ∈F); (ii.) de-
ﬁne φα,β : F ≈p−1(b) (b ∈Uα) by φα,β(y) =
φα(b, y). Then gβα(b) = φ−1
β,bφα,b ∈G for
b ∈Uα ∩Uβ; (iii.)gβα(b) : Uα ∩Uβ →G is
continuous.
coordinate function 
The homeomorphism
φα : Uα × F ≈p−1 (Uα)
for each α ∈ of the coordinate bundle (E, p,
B, F, G, Uα, φα) belonging to the ﬁber bundle
(E, p, B, F, G).
coordinate hyperplane 
A coordinate hyper-
plane in a vector space X over a ﬁeld K is the
image under a translation of a vector subspace
M with the quotient space X/M.
coordinate neighborhood 
The open cover-
ing {Uα}(α ∈) of B of the coordinate bundle
(E, p, B, F, G, Uα, φα) belonging to the ﬁber
bundle (E, p, B, F, G). See coordinate bundle.
coordinate system
Let S be a set of mathe-
matical objects. A coordinate system is a mech-
anism that assigns (tuples of) numbers to each
element of the set S. The numbers correspond-
ing to each element are called its coordinates. In
R2, such a reference system is called the rectan-
gular coordinate system. In R3, the coordinate
functions, u and v, of p−1 [where p is a one-to-
one regular mapping of an open set of R2 into
a subset of R3] constitute the coordinate system
associated with p.
coordinate transformation
Let E, B, F be
topological spaces and p : E →B be a contin-
uous map. Let G be an effective left topological

covariant functor
transformation group of F. Assume there ex-
ists an open covering {Uα} (α ∈) of B, and
a homeomorphism φα : UαXF ≈p−1(Uα) for
each α ∈. Deﬁne φα,β : F ≈p−1(b) (b ∈
Uα) by φα,β(y) = φα(b, y). Then gβα(b) =
φ−1
β,bφα,b ∈G for b ∈Uα∩Uβ. Then the contin-
uous transformation gβα is the coordinate trans-
formation of the coordinate bundle (E, p, B, F,
G, Uα, φα) belonging to the ﬁber bundle
(E, p, B, F, G).
coplanar 
Lying in the same plane.
coproduct 
For any two sets X and Y, a co-
product of X and Y is a disjoint union D in the
diagram
X
i
−→D
j
←−Y,
where i and j are injections. The set D is not
unique and can be constructed as follows. If X
and Y are disjoint, then let D = X∪Y. If X and
Y are not disjoint, let D = X ∪Y ′, where Y ′ is
a set that is equivalent to Y and disjoint from X.
Other coproducts of X and Y can be formed by
choosing different sets Y ′.
corresponding angles 
Let two straight lines
lying in R2 be cut by a transversal, so that angles
x and y are a pair of alternating interior angles,
and y and z are a pair of vertical angles. Then x
and z are corresponding angles.
cotangentbundle 
LetM beann-dimensional
differentiable manifold of class Cr. Consider
T (M), the union over p ∈M of all the vector
spaces Tp(M) of vectors tangent to M at p. De-
ﬁne π : T (M) →M by π(Tp(M)) = p. Then
T (M) may be regarded as a manifold called the
tangent bundle of M. The dual bundle is the
cotangent bundle.
coterminal angles 
Angles with the same ter-
minal side (the moving straight line which re-
volves around the ﬁxed straight line, the initial
side, to form the angle) and the same initial side.
Two angles are coterminal if they are generated
by the revolution of two lines about the same
point of the initial side in such a way that the ﬁ-
nal positions of the revolving lines are the same.
For example, 60◦ and -300◦ are coterminal an-
gles.
Countable Axiom of Choice 
The statement
that, for any countable family of non-empty,
pairwise disjoint sets {Xα}α∈, there exists a set
Y which consists of exactly one element from
each set in the family. Equivalently, if {Xα}α∈
is a countable family of non-empty sets, then
there exists a function f : {Xα}α∈ →
α∈
Xα such that f (Xα) ∈Xα for all α ∈. See
Axiom of Choice.
countable chain condition
(1) A partial or-
der (P, ≤) has the countable chain condition if
any antichain in P is countable. A set A ⊆P is
an antichain if its elements are pairwise incom-
patible; that is, for any p and q in A, there is no
r ∈P with r ≤p and r ≤q. Thus, P has the
countable chain condition (or is ccc) if it has no
uncountable subset of pairwise incompatible el-
ements. Examples of ccc partial orders include
the collection of all ﬁnite sequences of 0s and 1s
ordered by extension (p ≤q if p ⊇q), and the
collection of all measurable sets modulo mea-
sure zero sets ordered by inclusion ([A] ≤[B]
if A ⊆B).
(2) A topological space satisﬁes the count-
able chain condition if it contains no uncount-
able collection of pairwise disjoint non-empty
open sets. If X is a topological space and P is
the collection of all non-empty open subsets of
X ordered by p ≤q if and only if p ⊆q, then
X is a ccc topological space if and only if P is
a ccc partial order.
countably compact topological space
A
topologicalspaceX suchthatanycountableopen
cover of X contains a ﬁnite subcover. That is,
if each Un is open and X = ∪n∈NUn, then there
is a ﬁnite set A ⊆N with X = ∪n∈AUn. This
is equivalent to requiring that any countably in-
ﬁnite subset of X has an accumulation point.
The space of ordinals less than ω1 with the
order topology is a countably compact space
which is not compact.
counterclockwise
The direction of rotation
opposite to that in which the hands of the clock
move.

covering dimension
→ Obj(D) such that, for any A, B ∈Obj(C) the
following hold:
(i.) if f ∈ HomC(A, B), then
F(f ) ∈ HomD(F(A), F(B)) ;
(ii.) F(1C) = 1D;
(iii.) F(gf ) = F(g)F(f ), where f and g
are morphisms in C whose composition gf is
deﬁned.
covering dimension 
A nonnegative integer,
assigned to a set by means of coverings. For
topological spaces the covering dimension (or
Lebesque dimension) is deﬁned in terms of open
coverings. The dimension of a normal space x
is less than or equal to n if, in each ﬁnite open
covering of x, a ﬁnite open covering can be in-
scribed whose number of elements containing a
given point is less than or equal to n + 1.
covering group
p: E −→X is a covering
space of X if every point of X has a neighbor-
hood whose inverse image is the disjoint union
of open sets homeomorphic to the neighborhood
by p. The covering group (group of cover-
ing transformations) is the group of homeomor-
phisms of E which preserve the ﬁbers (homeo-
morphisms h : E −→E with ph = p).
The real line covers the circle S1 by the map
which takes x to e2πix. The group of covering
transformations is isomorphic to the group of
integers.
covering homotopy property 
A map p: E
−→B has the covering homotopy property if it
satisﬁesthefollowing: givenanymapf : X −→
E and any homotopy h: X × [0, 1] −→B of
p ◦f (so hi = pf ), there is a lift H : X ×
[0, 1] −→E of h so that pH = h and Hi = f ,
where i is the inclusion of X ×{0} in X ×[0, 1].
That is, given maps represented by the solid
lines in the diagram below,
X
f
−→
E
i ↓

X × I

B
there exists a map H : X × I −→E so that the
diagram with H added commutes.
A surjective map satisfying the covering ho-
motopy property is called a ﬁbration. This is
a generalization of the concept of ﬁber bundle;
the ﬁber in a ﬁbration is only determined up to
homotopy, that is, the inverse images of two dif-
ferent points (if B is connected) will only be
homotopy equivalent to each other.
covering map 
A continuous surjection p :
X →Y such that every y ∈Y has an open
path connected neighborhood U such that, for
each open path component V ⊆p−1(U), p is
a homeomorphism from V onto U. In other
words, the V s form a stack of copies over U
which cover it. For example, the map p(t) =
(cos t, sin t) is a covering map from R to the unit
circle.
covering space 
A topological space X is a
covering space of Y if there is a covering map
p : X →Y. See covering map. For example, R
is a covering space of the unit circle via p(t) =
(cos t, sin t).
covering transformation 
A map φ : E −→
E such that p ◦φ = φ, where p : E −→B is a
covering map of an arcwise connected, locally
arcwise connected space B. See covering map.
covering transformation group 
The group
of covering transformations φ : E −→E, un-
der composition. See covering transformation.
In the special case where E is the universal cover
of B, this group is isomorphic to the fundamen-
tal group of the space B.
cross-section
A cross-section or section of
a ﬁber bundle p : E −→B with ﬁber F is a
map s : B −→E with ph equal to the identity
on B. Clearly every trivial bundle B × F has
numerous sections. A non-trivial example is the
Möbius band, a bundle over its middle circle.
The inclusion of the middle circle is a section
for that bundle.
cube
One of the ﬁve types of regular poly-
hedra in E3. Also known as a hexahedron, it
is a solid bounded by 6 planes with 12 equal
edges and face angles that are right angles. In
En, it is a set consisting of all those points x =
(x1, ..., xn), for which xi is such that ai ≤xi ≤
bi for each i, where ai and bi are such that bi−ai
has the same value for each i.

cumulative hierarchy

deﬁned recursively using the power set opera-
tion at successor stages and union at limit stages:

nals α, and (iii.) Vλ = 

curvature 
Ameasureofthequantitativechar-
acteristics (in terms of numbers, vectors, ten-
sors) which describe the degree to which some
object (a curve, Riemannian manifold, etc.) de-
viates from certain other objects (a straight line,
a Euclidean surface, etc.), which are consid-
ered to be ﬂat. As a local property of a plane
curve, curvature may intuitively be thought of
as the degree to which a curve is “bent” at each
point. For non-planar space curves, curvature
is deﬁned as the magnitude of a rate of rota-
tion vector. Gauss had deﬁned the curvature of
a surface in R3 at a point (x, y, z) as the limit
of the ratio of the area of the region on a unit
sphere around a point (X, Y, Z) [determined by
the radius of the sphere in a direction normal to
(x, y, z)] to the area of the region on the sur-
face around (x, y, z), as these two areas shrink
to their respective points. Riemann’s concep-
tion of curvature for any n-dimensional mani-
fold was a generalization of Gauss’ deﬁnition
for surfaces.
curve 
A continuous function from (an inter-
val in) R into Rn, although usually referred to
as the image (range) of such a function.
Euclid distinguished lines from curves, but
today lines, in the Euclidean sense, are consid-
ered curves which include straight lines. Georg
Cantor deﬁned a curve as a continuum that is
nowhere dense in R2. A continuous curve in R2
that covers a square is a Peano curve.
curve of constant breadth 
Let E be the
boundary of a convex body X in R2, O an in-
terior point of X, and P an arbitrary point of
X different from O. E admits exactly one sup-
porting line l(P ) which is perpendicular to the
line OP and meets the half-line OP. Let OP
′
be the half-line with direction opposite to that of
OP , and l
′ the supporting line l(P
′). Then the
distance between the parallel lines l and l
′ is the
breadth of E. Let M = M(E) be the maximum
and m = m(E) be the minimum of the breath
of E. If M = m, then E is a curve of constant
breadth.
cusp 
A double point on a curve C, at which
two tangents to C are coincident.
cut point 
(1) In topology, a point p in a space
X such that X\{p} = A ∪B, where A and B
are nonempty open sets.
(2) In Riemannian geometry, if M is a Rie-
mannian manifold and p is a point of M, then
a point q of M is a cut point with respect to
p if there is a shortest geodesic joining p to q
which, if extended beyond q, fails to be a short-
est path to points beyond q. For example, on the
standard sphere the antipode of any point is the
unique cut point.
CW complex 
A topological space construc-
ted iteratively as follows. Let Dn be an n-cell,
that is, a set homeomorphic to all points of dis-
tance at most 1 from the origin in Rn; the bound-
aryofDn isthe(n−1)-sphere, Sn−1. Beginwith
a collection of points. At each stage, attach new
cells by identifying the boundary of a cell Dn
with points in lower dimensional cells.
One can build the sphere Sn in two distinct
ways. First, start with one point; attach the cell
Dn by identifying all points in its boundary with
that one point. Alternately, start with two points.
Attach two 1-cells (intervals) by sending one
endpoint to each of the two points that formed
the previous stage. This constructs a circle, S1.
Given Sn−1 by iteration, form Sn by identify-
ing the boundaries of each of two n-cells with
Sn−1. This latter construction is convenient for
studying real projective space.
Any manifold can be constructed as a CW
complex and such constructions are useful for
calculating the homology or cohomology of the
manifold.
cycle
An element c in Cn such that ∂n(c) = 0,
where Cn is a member of a chain complex over
a ring R. See chain complex.

(of Abelian groups), then the kth cycle group Zk
is the subgroup of Ck consisting of all elements
c such that ∂k(c) = 0. The boundary group

cylinder
Bn = ∂n+1/Cn+1 is a subgroup of the cycle
group, since ∂n+1◦∂n = 0. See chain complex.
cylinder
A ﬂat ruled surface in R3, which is
the locus of points on a straight line (the gen-
erator) moving parallel to itself, and intersect-
ing a given plane curve (the directrix). Thus,
as the generator, which is perpendicular to the
plane of the directrix, moves along the directrix,
it sweeps out a cylinder.
cylinder of revolution
A surface formed by
the set of all lines passing through a given circle
and perpendicular to theplane ofthe circle. Also
known as a right circular cylinder.
cylindrical helix
A helix whose path lies on
a cylinder, forming a constant angle with the el-
ements of the cylinder. A cylindrical helix is
described, for example, by the parametric equa-
tions
x = cos t

z = t

a line in space moving along a curve, always

Dedekind cut
D
Darboux’s frame
If γ (s) is a curve on a sur-
face M in Euclidean space R3, parameterized by
arc length, then there is an orthonormal frame
(T, U, V ) deﬁned along the curve called Dar-
boux’s frame. The ﬁrst vector, T = γ ′(s), is
the unit tangent vector to the curve. The vector
V = ν(γ (s)) is the unit normal to the surface
at the point. (This assumes that a normal vector
ﬁeld ν(P ) is speciﬁed.) The vector U = V × T
is the normal vector to the curve in the surface,
whose direction is determined by the choice of
surface normal. One can then deﬁne the analog
of the Frenet equations for the curve:
T ′
=
κgU + κnV
U′
= −κgT
+ τgV
V ′
= −κnT −τgU
The functions κg and κn are the geodesic cur-
vature and the normal curvature, respectively,
of the curve in the surface. τg is the geodesic
torsion.
decagon
A ten-sided polygon.
decidable
A set of objects of some sort is de-
cidable if there is an effective procedure (algo-
rithm) which, given an arbitrary object, decides
whether or not the object is in the set. This no-
tion, as deﬁned, is an intuitive notion. To deﬁne
this notion formally requires the formal notion
of computability and the ability to code effec-
tively (Gödel number) the objects in question.
See computable.
For example, the set of tautologies of pro-
positional logic is decidable; i.e., there is an ef-
fective procedure which, given a string from the
language of the propositional logic, can deter-
mine whether or not the string is a well-formed
formula, and if it is, can determine whether or
not the well-formed formula is a tautology. As
another example, a theory in ﬁrst order logic is
decidable if it is both complete and axiomatiz-
able by a decidable set of axioms.
decision problem
A decision problem asks
if there exists an effective procedure (algorithm)
for deciding the truth or falsity of an entire class
of statements. If such an effective procedure ex-
ists, the problem is said to be solvable; otherwise
the problem is said to be unsolvable.
This notion, as deﬁned, is intuitive. To deﬁne
it formally requires the formal notion of com-
putability, the ability to effectively code (Gödel
number) the statements, and the Church–Turing
Thesis.
For example, given an n-ary predicate R, the
decision problem associated with R asks if there
is an effective procedure for deciding, given ar-
bitrary natural numbers a1, . . . , an, whether
R(a1, . . . , an) is true or false.
This decision
problem is solvable if R is recursive (comput-
able) as a relation; otherwise it is unsolvable.
There are many famous decision problems.
Hilbert’s Tenth Problem asks if there is an effec-
tive procedure which, given a Diophantine equa-
tionp(x1, . . . , xn) = 0, wherep isapolynomial
with integer coefﬁcients, determines whether or
not there is an integer solution. It was proved
by results of Matijaseviˇc (1970) and Davis, Put-
nam, and Robinson (1961) that Hilbert’s Tenth
Problem is not solvable.
The decision prob-
lem for propositional logic, which asks if there
is an effective procedure which, given a well-
formed formula of propositional logic, deter-
mines whether or not that formula is provable,
was proved by Post (1921) to be solvable. On
the other hand, the decision problem (Entschei-
dungsproblem) for ﬁrst-order logic is not solv-
able (Church, 1936; Turing, 1936); i.e., if L is
a ﬁrst-order language with a k-ary function or
predicate symbol, for k ≥2, then there is no ef-
fective procedure that can determine whether or
not an arbitrary sentence of L is logically valid.
Dedekind cut
Suppose that X is a subset
of R and A, B are two subsets of X with the
following properties:
(i.) A ∩B = ∅;
(ii.) A ∪B = X;
(iii.) a < b for any a ∈A, b ∈B.
The sets A and B form a Dedekind cut if A has
a last element and B has no ﬁrst element, or if
A has no last element and B has a ﬁrst element.
X is an interval of R if and only if any choice of
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

deduction
A, B satisfying conditions (i.) through (iii.) is
a Dedekind cut.
If there exists a choice of A and B which is
not a Dedekind cut, then X can be extended to an
interval of R by including additional real num-
bers. For example, if X consists of the rational
numbers, then no choice of A, B is a Dedekind
cut. However, X may be extended by including
the irrational numbers. This technique can be
used if X is a subset of any complete linearly
ordered set.

See proof.
deﬁcientnumber 
Apositiveintegernhaving
the property that the sum of its positive divisors
is less than 2n, i.e., σ(n) < 2n. For example,
16 is deﬁcient, since
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 < 32 .

ber.
deﬁnition by recursion
See recursion.
degenerate conic 
A conic section formed by
a plane intersecting a conical surface either only
in the vertex of the surface (resulting in a point),
only at an element of the surface (resulting in
a line), or only at two elements of the surface
(resulting in two lines).
degeneratesimplex 
Ann-simplex(mapfrom
then-dimensionalanalogofatriangletoaspace)
whose image is less than n-dimensional.
degree of an arc 
The degree measure of the
central angle determining the arc, provided the
arc is minor. If the arc is major, its degree is 360
minus the degree measure of the central angle.
degree of mapping 
Let f : (Sn, x0) →
(Sn, x0) be a continuous map where n ≥ 1 and
let f∗: Hn(Sn, x0) →Hn(Sn, x0) be the in-
duced map. If z0 is the generator of Hn(Sn, x0),
then f∗(z0) = d · z0 for some integer d. In this
case d is the degree of the map f and is denoted
deg(f ).
An important consequence of this is the
Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem: Every contin-
uous map f : Bn →Bn has a ﬁxed point.
degree of unsolvability 
For a set of natural
numbers of A, the set
deg(A) = {B : B ≡T A};
i.e., the class of all sets B of natural numbers
which are Turing equivalent to A. A degree of
unsolvability is often called a Turing degree, or
simply a degree.
As an example, if A is a recursive (com-
putable)set, thendeg(A)consistsofallrecursive
(computable) sets. However, if A is computably
(recursively) enumerable, then deg(A) does not
consist of all computably enumerable sets.
de Morgan’s laws 
Let B be a Boolean alge-
bra with binary operations ∪, ∩ and unary oper-
ation ′. If X, Y ∈B, then:
(X ∩Y)′ = X′ ∪Y ′
(X ∪Y)′ = X′ ∩Y ′ .
See Boolean algebra.

b.
dense linear ordering
Given a set A with at
least two distinct elements and a linear ordering
≤on A, ≤is dense if, for all x, y ∈A with
x < y, there exists z ∈A with x < z < y.
The usual ordering ≤on Q, the set of rational
numbers, is dense.
dense subset
A subset A of a topological
space X such that ¯A = X, where ¯A denotes the
closure of A in X.
denumerable set
A set A, equinumerous
with the set N of natural numbers; i.e., such
that there is a bijection from A onto N.
For
example, the set Q of rational numbers is denu-
merable, while the set R of real numbers is not
denumerable.
derived set
The set of accumulation points
of a subset A of a topological space X. The
derived set of A is written A′. The closure of
A is then A ∪A′, and A is closed if and only if
A′ ⊆A.

two players A and B. The two players alternate
choosing natural numbers a1, b1, a2, b2, . . . . If
the sequence (a1, b1, a2, b2, . . . ) ∈X, then
player A wins. If not, player B wins. A strat-
egy is a rule that tells the player (either A or B)
which number to choose, based on the previous
choices of both players. A winning strategy is
a strategy in which the player always wins. The
game GX is determined if one of the two players
has a winning strategy.
developable surface 
A ruled surface is a sur-
face swept out by a straight line (called the gen-
erator) moving through space. It can be given a
parameterization of the form X(u, v) = C(u)+
vD(u)whereC isacurveandC′(u)×D(u)does
not vanish. If the tangent plane to the surface
at any point is tangent along the entire genera-
tor through the point, then the surface is called
a developable surface. For example, a cylinder
is a developable surface, as is a cone. A hy-
perboloid of one sheet is an example of a ruled
surface which is not a developable surface.
diagonal 
For any set X, the subset  =
{(x, x) : x ∈X} of X × X. This is also com-
monly referred to as the relation of equality on
X. See relation.
diagonal intersection 
If κ is a regular un-
countable cardinal and (Sα, α < κ) is a se-
quence of subsets of κ, the diagonal intersec-
tion of this sequence, denoted △{Sα : α < κ},
is {β : β ∈
α<β Sα}.

diameter 
The greatest distance between any
two points of the body in question.
diametral plane 
A plane containing all mid-
points of a set of parallel chords of a surface.
diamond 
A strengthening of the Continuum
Hypothesis (denoted ♦) which asserts that there
is a sequence of sets Sα ⊆α for α < ω1, called
the diamond sequence, which captures all sub-
sets of ω1 in a certain way. Given any X ⊆ω1,
the set of α where X ∩α = Sα is stationary in
ω1. In other words, there are a large number of
α where Sα is the same as X up to α.
To see why this implies the Continuum Hy-
pothesis, notice that if X ⊆ω, then
X ∩α = X
for any α ≥ω. But C = [ω, ω1) is closed and
unbounded, so there is an α ∈C∩S where Sα =
X ∩α = X. That is, each subset of the natural
numbers appears in the diamond sequence, so
the number of subsets is at most ω1.
Other consequences of ♦include the nega-
tion of Suslin’s Hypothesis; i.e., ♦implies there
is an ω1-Suslin tree.
difference of sets
For two sets X and Y, the
set X\Y consisting of all elements of X which
are not elements of Y. More precisely,

differentiable structure
A compatible way
of assigning, to each point in a space, a homeo-
morphism from a neighborhood of that point to
an open subset of n-dimensional real space Rn,
or of n-dimensional complex space Cn.
differential geometry
The body of geometry
that investigates curves and surfaces in the im-
mediate neighborhood of one of their points, us-
ing calculus, and analyzes what is implied about
the curve or surface as a whole on the basis of
this local behavior. A more advanced aspect of
differential geometry is the possibility of con-
structing geometrical systems determined solely
by concepts and postulates that affect only the
immediate neighborhood of each point of the
system.

dimension 
Any one of many possible dif-
ferent topologically invariant measures of the
size of a topological space. Different deﬁni-
tions of dimension include the Lebesgue dimen-
sion, the homological dimension, the cohomo-
logical dimension, and the large and small in-
ductive dimensions. The large inductive dimen-
sion, which agrees with the Lebesgue and small
inductive dimensions when the space is separa-
ble and metrizable, is deﬁned inductively as fol-
lows. We say that the empty set has dimension
−1. Assuming that we have deﬁned all spaces
of dimension ≤n, we say that a space X has
dimension ≤n + 1 if, for any disjoint closed
subsets C and D of X, there is a closed subset
T of X with dimension T ≤n such that X\T
is the union of two disjoint open subsets, one
containing C and the other containing D. We
then say that a topological space has dimension
n if it has dimension ≤n but it does not have
dimension ≤n − 1.
dimension function 
A function d : L →
Z from a lattice L to the nonnegative integers
satisfying the conditions (i.) d(x+y)+d(xy) =
d(x)+d(y) for all x, y ∈L, and (ii.) if [x, y] is
an elementary interval in L, then d(y) = d(x)+
1.
dimension of a complex 
Let X be a CW-
complex and let E be the set of cells of X. The
dimension of X is given by:
dimX = sup{dim(e) : e ∈E} .
We say that X is ﬁnite dimensional if dimX is
ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensional otherwise.
dimensions of a rectangle 
The dimensions
that fully describe a rectangle, namely length
and width.
Dimension Theorem of Afﬁne Geometry
Given afﬁne space An, with nondisjoint sub-
spaces Ar and As of dimension r and s, respec-
tively, then r + s = dim(Ar ∪As) + dim(Ar ∩
As).
dimension theory

devoted to the deﬁnition and study of the notion
of dimension in various classes of topological
spaces.

omorphic to a subspace of X.

dimensional Euclidean space, which is the sur-
face of revolution of a tractrix.

such that for all a, b ∈D there exists an element
c ∈D so that a ⪯c and b ⪯c.
directrix 
The polar, with respect to the recip-
rocating circle of a conic section, of the center
of the reciprocal circle of the conic section; this
applies when the conic section is regarded as
the reciprocal of a circle. Alternatively, if the
conic section is regarded as a curve generated
by a point moving in the plane such that the ra-
tio of its distance from a ﬁxed point to a ﬁxed
line remains constant, then the directrix of the
conic section is that ﬁxed line.

function.) For example, if f = φ, the Euler
phi function, and g = τ, the number of divisors
function,
(φ ∗τ)(10)
= φ(1)τ(10)+φ(2)τ(5)+φ(5)τ(2)+φ(10)τ(1)
= 18 .
In fact, φ ∗τ = σ, the sum of divisors func-
tion. The Dirichlet convolution is also called
the Dirichlet product.
Dirichlet inverse 
The Dirichlet inverse of an
arithmetic function f is a function f −1 such that
the Dirichlet convolution f ∗f −1 = I, the iden-
tity function. (See arithmetic function, Dirichlet
convolution.) A function f has a Dirichlet in-
verse if and only if f (1) ̸= 0. When it exists, the
inverse is unique. For example, µ, the Möbius
function, and u, the unit function, are Dirichlet
inverses of one another.
Dirichlet multiplication 
The operation un-
der which the Dirichlet convolution of two arith-
metic functions is computed. It is commutative
and associative. In fact, the set of arithmetic
functions f such that f (1) ̸= 0 forms a group
under this operation. See also Dirichlet convo-
lution.
Dirichlet product
See Dirichlet convolution.
discrete linear ordering
A linear ordering
≤on a set A such that
(i.) every element x ∈A that has a successor
(i.e., an element y ∈A such that x < y) has
an immediate successor (i.e., there exists z ∈A
such that z is a successor of x and there does not
exist y ∈A with x < y < z), and
(ii.) every element x ∈A that has a prede-
cessor (i.e., an element y ∈A such that y < x)
has an immediate predecessor (i.e., there exists
z ∈A such that z is a predecessor of x and there
does not exist y ∈A with z < y < x).
The usual ordering ≤on the set N of natural
numbers is discrete.
discrete topology
The topology on a set X,
consisting of all subsets of X. That is, every
subset is open in X.
disjoint sets
Two sets X and Y which have
no common elements. Symbolically, X and Y
are disjoint if
X ∩Y = ∅.
disjunctive normal form

(sentential) formula of the form

Aij

;
i.e.,
(A11 ∧· · · ∧A1m1) ∨· · · ∨
(An1 ∧· · · ∧Anmn) ,
where each Aij, 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi, is
either a sentence symbol or the negation of a
sentence symbol. Every well-formed proposi-
tional formula is logically equivalent to one in
disjunctive normal form.
For example, if A, B, and C are sentence
symbols, then the well-formed formula ((A →
B) →C) is logically equivalent to (A ∧B ∧
C)∨(A∧¬B ∧C)∨(A∧¬B ∧¬C)∨(¬A∧
B ∧C) ∨(¬A ∧¬B ∧C), which is a formula
in disjunctive normal form.
distance
Part of the deﬁnition of a metric
space M.
The distance function on M, d :
M × M →R, must be nonnegative-valued
and satisfy (i.) d(P1, P2) = 0 if and only if
P1 = P2, (ii.)
d(P1, P2) = d(P2, P1), and
(iii.) d(P1, P2) + d(P2, P3) ≥d(P1, P3) for
all P1, P2, P3 ∈M. Then the distance between
two points P1 and P2 is d(P1, P2). We may then
also deﬁne the distance between any two subsets
S and T of M to be the greatest lower bound of
the set {d(s, t) : s ∈S, t ∈T }.
Inthree-dimensionalEuclideanspace, thedis-
tance function is given by

real numbers, which satisﬁes the following three
conditions:
(i.) d(x, y) ≥ 0, and d(x, y) = 0 if and only
if x = y;
(ii.) d(x, y) = d(y, x); and
(iii.) d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥d(x, z).
This last condition, known as the triangle in-
equality, generalizes the principle of plane ge-
ometry that the length of any side of a triangle
is not longer than the sum of the lengths of the
other two sides.
division algorithm 
If a and b ̸= 0 are in Z,
there exist unique integers r so that a = bq + r
and 0 ≤r < b. A clever repeated application of
the division algorithm, known as Euclid’s algo-
rithm, leads to the computation of the greatest
common divisor of the integers a and b. See
Euclidean algorithm.
Division algorithms hold in other rings, such
as the polynomials with real coefﬁcients.
divisor 
If a and b are elements of a ring and
there exists an element c in that ring satisfying
bc = a, then b (similarly, c) is a divisor of
a. For example, in the ring of integers, 6 is a
divisor of 24 since 6 × 4 = 24 (and 4, 6, and
24 are all integers), while 5 is not a divisor of
24 since there is no integer c so that 5c = 24.
However, in the ring Z36 (the integers mod 36),
5 is a divisor of 24 since 5 × 12 = 24 in Z36
(alternatively, 5 × 12 ≡ 24 (mod 36)).
dodecagon 
A polygon having 12 sides.
dodecahedron 
A polyhedron with 12 faces.
The regular dodecahedron, the regular con-
vex polyhedron having 12 pentagonal faces, 30
edges, and 20 vertices, is one of the ﬁve platonic
solids.
domain 
For a binary relation R on two sets
X and Y, the set
dom(R) = {x : (x, y) ∈R for some y ∈Y} .
Commonly, the relation R is a function f , R =
{(x, y) : y = f (x)}, and the domain of the
function f is the domain of the relation R, in
this case. See relation.
double angle formulas 
The trigonometric
identities sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ and cos 2θ =
1 − 2 sin2 θ.
dual 
The dual of a concept represented by
a diagram is the diagram in which the vertices
are the same, but all arrows are reversed. See
diagram.
dual bundle 
Given a bundle ξ, with projec-
tion
π : E →B ,
the dual bundle ξ∗ of ξ has the projection
π′ : E′ →B ,
with E′ = ∪p∈B[π−1(p)]∗, where [π−1(p)]∗
denotes the dual space of π−1(p), and π′ takes
each [π−1(p)]∗ to p.
dual category 
The dual of a category C (also
known as the opposite of C) is the category Cop
which satisﬁes the following properties:
(i.) Obj(Cop) = Obj(C);
(ii.) HomCop(A, B) = Hom C(B, A).
Composition of morphisms in Cop is deﬁned by
gopf op = (fg)op . See category.
dual complex
The set of dual cells of sim-
plices of a complex. More speciﬁcally, consider
a simplicial complex C. Let C′ be the barycen-
tric subdivision of C and, for any q-simplex σ
of C, let C(σ) denote the union of all (n −q)-
simplices (n being the dimension of the mani-
fold) of C′. Then the set C∗= {C(σ) : σ ∈C}
is the dual complex of C.
dual convex cone
Given a convex cone C ⊆
Rn, the set {x ∈Rn : (x, y) ≤0 for all y ∈C}.
Here (x, y) denotes the inner product of x and
y.
Dupin indicatrix
If M is a surface in R3,
and P is a point in M, then a plane parallel to
the tangent plane to M at P and very close to
the tangent plane will intersect M in a curve that
is approximately a quadratic curve. The Dupin
indicatrix is a quadratic curve that is similar to
this curve of intersection. If the principal cur-
vatures κ1 and κ2 of the surface at P are both
positive, then the Dupin indicatrix is given by

dyadic compactum
the ellipse κ1x2 + κ2y2 = 1. If κ1 > 0 > κ2,
then the Dupin indicatrix is the pair of hyper-
bolas κ1x2 + κ2y2 = ±1. When one of the
principal curvatures is 0, the indicatrix is a pair
of parallel straight lines.
duplication of cube 
One of the “Three Fa-
mous Greek Problems” from the classical Greek
geometers. In this problem, a cube is to be con-
structed with double the volume of a given cube.
It can be proved that this construction is impos-
sible using a straight edge and compass alone.
dyadic compactum 
Let X be the discrete
space with two points. The inﬁnite product of
copies of X, with the product topology, is the
dyadic compactum. It is a compact, uncount-
able, totally disconnected, Hausdorff space,
homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See also Can-
tor set.

Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms
E
eccentric angle 
For an ellipse, the angle θ,
where the ellipse is described parametrically by
the equations x = a cos θ, y = b sin θ. Simi-
larly, the eccentric angle at (x, y) for a hyper-
bola described parametrically by the equations
x = a sec φ, y = b tan φ is φ.
eccentric circles 
(1) For an ellipse, the cir-
cles centered at the center of the ellipse with
diameters equal to the lengths of the major and
minor axes of the ellipse.
(2) The two eccentric circles of a hyperbola
are those with center at the origin of the hyper-
bola, and with diameters equal to the lengths of
the transverse and conjugate axes of the hyper-
bola.
eccentricity 
For a conic section, the ratio
OA
r , when the conic section in question is re-
garded as the reciprocal of a circle with radius
r and center A with respect to the circle having
center O. Alternatively, if the conic section is
regarded as a curve generated by a point mov-
ing in the plane such that the ratio of its distance
from a ﬁxed point to a ﬁxed line remains con-
stant, then the eccentricity of the conic is that
distance ratio.
effective 
Informally, the term effective is of-
ten used as in the deﬁnition of effective pro-
cedure, as a synonym for “algorithmic”. For-
mally, the term effective is synonymous with
computable, or recursive. See effective proce-
dure, computable, recursive.
effectively enumerable 
A set A of natural
numbers such that there is an effective procedure
which, when given a natural number n, will out-
put 1 after ﬁnitely many steps if n ∈A and will
run forever otherwise. Alternatively, A is effec-
tively enumerable if there is an effective proce-
dure that lists the elements of A. In other words,
for an effectively enumerable set A, if n ∈A,
one will ﬁnd out eventually, but if n ̸∈A, then
one will never know for sure.
For example, the set of all natural numbers n
suchthatthereexistsaconsecutiverunofexactly
n 5s in the decimal expansion of π is effectively
enumerable.
This notion is intuitive; the corresponding
formal notion is recursively enumerable, also
known as computably enumerable. See recur-
sively enumerable.
effective procedure 
An effective procedure
(or algorithm) is a ﬁnite, precisely given list of
instructions which is deterministic; i.e., at any
step during the execution of the instructions,
there must be at most one instruction that can
be applied. This notion is intuitive for a corre-
sponding formal mathematical notion. See com-
putable, recursive.
Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms
Let T be a cat-
egory of pairs of topological spaces and continu-
ous maps and let A denote the category of Abel-
ian groups. Suppose we have the following:
(i.) A functor Hp : T →A for each integer
p ≥0, whose value is denoted Hp(X, A). If
f : (X, A) →(Y, B) is a continuous map, let
(f∗)p denote the induced map from Hp(X, A)
to Hp(Y, B).
(ii.) A natural transformation
∂p : Hp(X, A) →Hp−1(A)
for each integer p ≥0, where A denotes the pair
(A, ∅).
These functors and natural transformations
must satisfy the following three axioms from
category theory. All pairs are in T .
Axiom 1. If i is the identity, then (i∗)p is the
identity for each p.
Axiom 2. ((k ◦h)∗)p = (k∗)p ◦(h∗)p.
Axiom 3. If f : (X, A) →(Y, B), then the

then (h∗)p = (k∗)p for each p.
Excision Axiom. Given (X, A), let U be
an open subset of X such that ¯U ⊂ IntA. If
(X \ U, A \ U) is in A, then the inclusion (X \
U, A \ U) →(X, A) induces an isomorphism
Hp(X \ U, A \ U) ≃Hp(X, A) .

the Hp(P ) = {0} for p ̸= 0 and H0(P) ≃ Z.
Axiom of Compact Support. 
If z

Hp(X, A), there is a pair (X0, A0) in T with X0
and A0 compact, such that z is in the image of
the homomorphism Hp(X0, A0) →Hp(X, a)
induced by the inclusion (X0, A0) →(X, A).
Anytheorythatsatisﬁestheseaxiomsiscalled
a homology theory on T . (See homology the-
ory.) The ﬁrst homology theory was deﬁned for
the category of compact polyhedra. Later sev-
eral other homology theories, such as singular
homology, were deﬁned. Eilenberg and Steen-
rod then showed that the above axioms com-
pletely classiﬁed the homology groups on the
class of polyhedra. There are also similar ax-
ioms for cohomology theory, except for the Ax-
iom of Compact Support.
elementarily equivalent structures 
Two
structures A and B in the language L such that,
for every sentence φ of L, A |= φ if and only
if B |= φ; that is, φ is true in A if and only if
it is true in B. Elementary equivalence (written
A ≡B) expresses the property that L cannot
distinguish between the structures A and B.
elementary diagram 
The theory of all sen-
tences which hold in a model A, using an extra
constant symbol for each element of A. More
precisely, letAbeamodelinthelanguageL, and
let LA be the expansion of L which adds a new
constant symbol ca for each a ∈A. Then the
elementary diagram of A is the set of all LA-
sentences which are true in the model A with
each ca interpreted by a.
elementary embedding 
Let L be a ﬁrst or-
der language, and let A and B be structures
for L, where A and B are the universes of A
and B, respectively. An elementary embedding
of A into B is an embedding h of A into B
with the property that for every well-formed for-
mula ϕ with free variables v1, . . . , vn and ev-
ery n-tuple a1, . . . , an of elements of A, if |=A

notation used here).
elementary substructure 
Let L be a ﬁrst
order language, and let A and B be structures for
L, where A is the universe of A. The structure
A is an elementary substructure of B if
(i.) A is a substructure of B, and
(ii.) for all well-formed formulas ϕ with
free variables from among v1, . . . , vn and all n-
tuples a1, . . . , an of elements of A,
if
|=A ϕ[a1, . . . , an], then |=B ϕ[a1, . . . , an].
See satisfy (for the deﬁnition of the notation
used here).
If A is an elementary substructure of B, then
B is an elementary extension of A. The term

with elementary substructure.
As an example, let L be the ﬁrst order lan-
guage with equality whose only predicate sym-

(1) Let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage, and let A and B be structures for L, with
universes A and B for A and B, respectively. A
function h : A →B is an embedding if h is
injective and
(i.) for each n-ary predicate symbol P and
every a1, . . . an ∈A,
(a1, . . . , an) ∈P A
⇔(h(a1), . . . , h(an)) ∈P B ,

and
(iii.) for each n-ary function symbol f and
every a1 . . . , an ∈A,
h(f A(a1, . . . , an)) = f B(h(a1), . . . , h(an)).
If there is an embedding of A into B, then A

A set denoted ∅which has no el-
ements.
enumeration
An enumeration of a set A is a
surjection f : N →A; i.e., a function f which
has domain N and range A. Such a function
is called an enumeration because it “lists” the
elements of A. An enumeration need not be an
injection (i.e., one-to-one), nor list the elements
of A in any particular order.

via a transformation.

for all B′ ∈B′, if x ∈B′ then there exists B ∈B
so that x ∈B ⊂B′.

Erlangen Program 
The name given to a
method for studying the geometry of a space
X.
Initiated by Felix Klein, the program pro-
posed a study of the geometric properties of a
space X that remain invariant under a speciﬁed
group of one-to-one continuous transformations
of the space.
For example, the geometry of the Euclidean
plane can be described by the group of rigid mo-
tions of R2 that take congruent ﬁgures to one
another.
escribed circle of a triangle

gent to one side of the triangle as well as to the
extensions of the other two sides.
Euclidean

clid’s Elements.
Euclidean algorithm
A method for deter-
mining the greatest common divisor of two
nonzero integers using repeated application of
the division algorithm. See division algorithm.
To ﬁnd gcd(10, 46), begin by using the divi-
sion algorithm to determine the remainder ob-
tained when 44 is divided by 12:
46 = 4(10) + 6 .
Next, repeat the division algorithm with 10 and
6 (the dividend and remainder from above):
10 = 1(6) + 4 .
This procedure (repeating the division algorithm
with the previous dividend and remainder) is re-
peated until a 0 remainder is obtained (note that
this is guaranteed to occur eventually, since the
remainders are necessarily decreasing). To con-
tinue the illustration, repeat the division algo-
rithm with 6 and 4 to obtain,
6 = 1(4) + 2 ,
then apply the division algorithm one more time
to get
4 = 2(2) + 0 .
The last nonzero remainder will always be the
greatest common divisor of the two original in-
tegers.
To illustrate the algorithm more succinctly,
46
= 4(10) + 6
10
= 1(6) + 4
6
= 1(4) + 2
4
= 2(2) + 0
As 2 is the last nonzero remainder, we conclude
that gcd(10, 46) = 2.
Also known as Euclid’s algorithm.

of n numbers, the coordinates of the point, and

Euler characteristic 
Let K be a simplicial
complex of dimension n and let αm be the num-
ber of simplices of dimension m. Then the
Euler-Poincaré characteristic, χ(K), of K is
deﬁned by:
χ(K) =


m=0
(−1)mαm .
The most common version of the Euler-Poincaré
characteristic occurs in the case where K has
dimension two. If we let V be the number of
vertices, E be the number of edges, and F be the
number of faces of K, then χ(K) = V −E+F.
The Euler-Poincaré characteristic is an in-
variant of the complex; that is, it is independent
of the triangulation of the complex K.
If βp is the pth Betti number of K, that is
βp = rankHp(K)/Tp(K) where Tp(K) is the
torsion subgroup of Hp(K), then

Euler phi function 
The arithmetic function,
denoted ϕ, which, for any positive integer n, re-
turns the number of positive integers less than or
equal to n which are relatively prime to n. (See
arithmetic function.) That is, φ(n) = #{i : 1 ≤
i ≤n and (i, n) = 1}. For example, φ(6) =
2, φ(13) = 12. The value of φ(n) is even for all
n > 1. It is multiplicative; its value at a prime
power is given by φ(pi) = pi−1(p − 1). It is
also called the totient function.
Euler-Poincaré class 
Given an orientable
vector bundle ξ, with base space B, on Rn, the
primary obstruction in Hn(B; Z) for construct-
ing a cross-section of the associated (n − 1)-
sphere bundle. The Euler-Poincare class of a

If f is completely multiplicative (f (mn) =
f (m)f (n) for all m, n), in which case f (pk) =

number of vertices, E = number of edges, and
F = number of faces in the polyhedron. This
theorem may be generalized to state that, for any
ﬁnite CW complex, α0 −α1 + α2 = 2, where
αi = number of i-cells of the CW complex.

factor of integer 
The integer b is a factor of
the integer a if there exists an integer c so that
a = bc. For example, 8 is a factor of 24 since
24 = 8×3, but 8 is not a factor of 36 since there
is no integer c where 8c = 36. See also divisor.

A family of sets is a function from an
index set  to the set of subsets of a set X whose
value at α ∈ is denoted by Xα. Although the
function can be denoted in the usual way as a
set of ordered pairs {(α, Xα) : α ∈}, it is
completely speciﬁed by {Xα : α ∈}.

For a given positive integer n, con-
struct the Farey series Fn of order n, that is, the
ascending sequence of rational numbers a
b be-
tween 0 and 1 with the property that 0 ≤a ≤
b ≤n and GCD(a, b) = 1. Next, determine
the mediants of all consecutive elements of Fn.
(See mediant.) A Farey arc is an interval of the
form (p, q), where p and q are consecutive me-
diants. These intervals are usually visualized as
arcs lying on the circle of circumference 1 on
which the number x is represented by the point
Px lying x units counterclockwise from 0 (the
“bottom” of the circle). Under the identiﬁcation
0 = 1 on this circle, we also include the arc
( n
n+1, 1
n+1) which runs from the “last” mediant
to the ﬁrst. Each of these arcs contains exactly
one member of Fn The collection of Farey arcs
of order n is called the Farey dissection (of order
n) of the circle. See also Farey dissection.
Farey dissection 
The Farey dissection of or-
der n is the collection of Farey arcs of order n.

A number of the form Fn =

example, F3 = 257. The Fermat numbers
are named after Pierre de Fermat, a 17th cen-
tury lawyer and amateur mathematician, who
conjectured that all Fn are prime. The inte-
gers Fn, n ≤ 4, are in fact prime, but no other
prime Fermat numbers are known. All Fn with
5 ≤n ≤ 27 (except n = 24) are known to be
composite.

Fibonacci sequence
The recursive sequence
{fn} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . . } deﬁned by the ini-
tial conditions f0 = f1 = 1 and the recursive
equation fn+1 = fn+fn−1. The mathematician
Leonardo de Fibonacci originally developed this
sequence to model the so-called “Rabbit Prob-
lem”: Suppose that rabbits mature in one month,
that the gestation period for rabbits is also one
month, that a female rabbit always gives birth
to a breeding pair of rabbits, and that rabbits
never die. If a male and female rabbit are left on
an uninhabited island at birth, how many pairs
of rabbits will there be after a given number of
months?
Initially, there is one pair of rabbits (we let
f0 denote the number (1) of pairs of immature
rabbits at the end of the “0th” month). At the
end of the ﬁrst month, the rabbits have matured
and are able to reproduce (after a gestation pe-
riod of one month, the female will give birth) so
that f1 = 1, as well. At the end of the second
month, the female rabbit has given birth to a pair
of rabbits, so f2 = 2. At the end of the third
month, the new pair of rabbits has just matured
and the ﬁrst pair gives birth to another pair of
rabbits. Thus, f3 = 3. At the end of the fourth
month, both the original pair and the ﬁrst pair
of offspring give birth to pairs of rabbits, so that
f4 = 5. It is left to the reader to show that the
nth term of the Fibonacci sequence provides the
number of pairs of rabbits which are alive at the
end of the nth month.
ﬁlter
(1) A ﬁlter on a set S (or in P(S)) is a
collection F of subsets of S such that (i.) S ∈F,
(ii.) A, B ∈F implies A ∩B ∈F, for all A,
B and (iii.) A ∈F and A ⊆B implies B ∈F,
for all A, B. A proper ﬁlter does not contain the
empty set. For example, if S is any inﬁnite set,
the Fréchet ﬁlter on S is the set of all coﬁnite
subsets of S. The Fréchet ﬁlter is a proper ﬁl-
ter. Another important example of a proper ﬁlter
is the club ﬁlter on some uncountable cardinal
number κ. The club ﬁlter on κ is the set of all
club subsets of κ.
(2) If (B, ∨, ∧, ∼, 1, 0) is a Boolean alge-
bra, F ⊆B is a ﬁlter in B if (i) 1 ∈F, (ii)
a, b ∈F implies a ∧b ∈F, for all a, b, and
(iii) a ∈F and a ∧b = a implies b ∈F, for
all a, b.
For example, (P(N), ∪, ∩, ∼, N, Ø)
is a Boolean algebra, and the set of all coﬁnite
subsets of N is a ﬁlter in this Boolean algebra.
(3) If (P, ≤) is a partially ordered set, F ⊆P
is a ﬁlter in P if (i.) for all a, b ∈F, there exists
c ∈F such that c ≤a and c ≤b, and (ii.) for
all a ∈F and all x ∈P , x ≤a implies x ∈F.
ﬁlter in a partial order
A nonempty subset
G of a partial order (P, ≤) such that any two
elements of G are compatible in G and G is
closed upwards. That is, for any p and q in
G, there is an r ∈G with r ≤p and r ≤q
(compatibility), and for any p ∈G, if q ∈P
with p ≤q, then q ∈G (closed up). Filters
capture large elements in a partial order in the
same way that ideals capture small elements.
ﬁnal object
An object F in a category C with
the property that, for any object X in C, there
exists a unique morphism g ∈HomC(X, F).

A set A (of sets) is of ﬁnite
character if A ̸= ∅and for all sets X, X is in A
if and only if every ﬁnite subset of X is in A.
For example, let A be the collection of all
sets that contain pairwise disjoint subsets of N.
Then A has ﬁnite character.

is a set B ∈Bx with x ∈B ⊂U.
ﬁrst fundamental form
The quadratic form
deﬁned on tangent vectors to a surface M in
Euclidean space R3 by taking the square of the
length of the vector. If a portion of the surface
is parameterized by
X(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)) ,
then a tangent vector can be represented as a
linear combination of the vectors Xu
=
( dx
du, dy
du, dz
du) and Xv = ( dx
dv , dy
dv , dz
dv ). Let
E(u, v) = Xu · Xu, F(u, v) = Xu · Xv
and
G(u, v) = Xv · Xv .
Then any tangent vector aXu + bXv has length
given by
√
Ea2 + 2Fab + Gb2. The ﬁrst fun-
damental form is classically given in the form:
ds2 = Edu2 + 2Fdudv + gdv2 .
ﬁrst order language
A ﬁrst order language
L for ﬁrst order logic consists of the following
alphabet of symbols:
(i.) (, ) (parentheses)
(ii.) ¬, →(logical connectives)
(iii.) an inﬁnite list of variables v1, v2, . . .
(iv.) a symbol = for equality (which is op-
tional)
(v.) a quantiﬁer ∀
(vi.) predicate symbols: for each positive
integer n, a particular, possibly empty, set of
symbols, called n-place predicate symbols
(vii.) constant symbols: a particular, possi-
bly empty, set of symbols, called constant sym-
bols
(viii.) function symbols: for each positive in-
teger n, a particular, possibly empty, set of sym-
bols, called n-place function symbols (constant
symbols are sometimes called 0-place function
symbols).
In item (ii.), any complete set of logical con-
nectivescouldbeused. Initem(v.), theuniversal
quantiﬁer ∀could be replaced by the existential
quantiﬁer ∃.
Such a language is called a ﬁrst order lan-
guage because the quantiﬁer ranges over vari-
ables only, as opposed to a second order lan-
guage, where there are two types of quantiﬁers.
Some examples of ﬁrst order languages are
the language of set theory and the language of
elementary number theory.
The language of set theory is a ﬁrst order lan-
guage that contains equality and one two-place

ﬁrst order logic
predicate ∈. In this language, the variables are
intended to represent sets, and ∈ is intended to
be interpreted as “is an element of”.
The language of elementary number theory
is a ﬁrst order language that contains equality,
a single constant symbol 0, one two-place pred-
icate <, one one-place function symbol S, and
three two-place function symbols +, ·, and E.
In this language, the variables are intended to
represent natural numbers, S is intended to be
interpreted as the successor function, and 0, <,
+, ·, and E are intended to be interpreted as 0,
the usual ordering on the natural numbers, addi-
tion, multiplication, and exponentiation, respec-
tively.
ﬁrst order logic 
A formal logic with sym-
bols from a ﬁrst order language, rules that tell
which expressions from the language are well-
formed formulas, a semantic notion of truth (see
structure, satisfy), and a syntactical notion of
provability (see predicate calculus, proof).

ﬁxedpoint 
Letf : X →X becontinuous. A
point x0 ∈X is a ﬁxed point for f if f (x0) = x0.
See Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem.
focal property of a conic 
A property of a
conic section with regard to its focus or foci.
For an ellipse, this property is lines drawn from
the foci to a ﬁxed point on the ellipse make equal
angles with the tangent at the point. For a hy-
perbola, it is lines drawn from the foci to a ﬁxed
point on the hyperbola make an angle that is bi-
sectedbythetangentatthepoint. Foraparabola,
it is the line from the focus to a ﬁxed point on the
parabola makes an angle with the tangent equal
to that made by the tangent with the line parallel
to the axis of the parabola passing through the
point.
focus 
A point or points in the plane, corre-
sponding to a given conic section, whose role
varies depending upon the type of conic. An
ellipse may be thought of as the locus of points
in the plane whose distances from the foci have
a constant sum. A hyperbola may be thought
of as the locus of points in the plane whose dis-
tances from the foci have a constant difference.
A parabola may be thought of as the locus of
points in the plane whose distances from the fo-
cus and a given line (see also directrix) are equal.
foliation 
A family {Nλ : λ ∈} of arcwise-
connected pairwise disjoint subsets covering a
given manifold M such that every point in M
has a local coordinate system (x1, . . . , xn) so
that each Nλ is given by xn−k+1 =constant, . . .  ,
xn = constant for some 0 ≤k ≤n.
foot of perpendicular 
Suppose l is a line in
the Euclidean (or hyperbolic) plane and P is a
point not lying on l. Then the unique point Q
lying on the line l such that the line through P
and Q is perpendicular to l is called the foot of
the perpendicular from P to l.
forgetful functor 
A functor F from a cat-
egory C to Set that assigns to each object
A ∈Obj(C) its underlying set (also denoted by
A) and to each morphism f : A →B in C
the function f : A →B. Thus, the functor
“forgets” any additional properties that the ob-
jects and morphisms in C have. For example, if
C = Grp, then a group A ∈C is mapped to the
set A and a group homomorphism f : A →B
is mapped to the function f ; all group-theoretic
properties possessed by A and f are ignored.
See functor.

four-space 
The topological vector space
formed by taking the Cartesian product of four
copies of the real line, denoted E4, R4 or R4. A
point in four-space is uniquely determined by an
ordered quadruple (a, b, c, d) of real numbers.
fraction 
If a and b are integers with b ̸=
0, then the fraction a ÷ b denotes the rational
number resulting from the quotient a ÷ b.

free variable
Let L be a ﬁrst order language.
If x is a variable and α is a well-formed for-
mula of L, then x occurs free in α (or x is a
free variable in α) is deﬁned by induction on the
complexity of α, as follows:

functor
(i.) If α is an atomic formula, then x occurs
free in α if x occurs in α.
(ii.) If α = (¬β), then x occurs free in (¬β)
if x occurs free in β.
(iii.) If α = (β →γ ), then x occurs free in
(β →γ ) if x occurs free in β or in γ .
(iv.) If α = ∀viβ, then x occurs free in ∀viβ
if x occurs free in β and x ̸= vi.
As an example, v1 and v3 occur free, while
v2 does not occur free, in
∀v2(v1 = v2 →∀v1(v1 = v3)).
Frenet frame 
An orthonormal frame
{T (t), N(t), B(s)} of vectors at the point C(s)
on a given curve in R3, giving a moving coor-
dinate system along the curve. Assume C has
three continuous derivatives and that C′(t) and
C′′(t) are linearly independent. The ﬁrst vec-
tor, T , is the unit vector tangent to the curve,
given by
C′(t)
||C′(t)|| . The second unit vector, N, is
the principal normal to the curve. It lies in the
plane spanned by C′(t) and C′′(t), is perpendic-
ular to T , and is chosen so that it makes an acute
angle with C′′(t). The third vector, B, is the
binormal vector. It is deﬁned by B = T × N.
Frenet’s formulas 
Equations that relate the
fundamental geometric invariants of a curve in
Euclidean space or, more generally, in a Rie-
mannian 3-manifold.
SupposeC(s)isacurvepossessingthreecon-
tinuous derivatives, parameterized by arc length.
Assume that C′′(s) ̸= 0. Then the curve has a
Frenet frame (T, N, B) satisfying the following
linear system of differential equations:
C′(s) = T (s)
T ′(s) = k(s)N(s)
N′(s) = −k(s)T (s) + τ(s)B(s)
B′(s) = −τ(s)N(s)
The function k(s) is the geodesic curvature, and
the function τ(s) is the torsion of the curve. See
Frenet frame.
Frobenius integrability condition 
The con-
dition that must be satisﬁed by a k-dimensional
distribution in an n-dimensional manifold in or-
der for the distribution to be tangent to the leaves
of a k-dimensional foliation. Given a manifold
M, a distribution  assigns to each point P
in M a k-dimensional subspace of the tangent
space at P . It is integrable if the manifold is
the union of k-dimensional submanifolds, such
that the k-plane (p) is the tangent plane of the
k-manifold through p. The Frobenius condition
says that if X and Y are vector ﬁelds deﬁned in
a neighborhood of P such that X(Q) and Y(Q)
lie in (Q), then the Lie bracket [X, Y](Q) also
lies in (Q). See foliation.
Frobenius Theorem 
A theorem that gives
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a distri-
bution in a manifold to be tangent to the leaves
of a foliation. Given a manifold M, a distri-
bution  assigns to each point P in M a k-
dimensional subspace of the tangent space at P .
It is integrable if the manifold is the union of k-
dimensional submanifolds, such that the k-plane
(p) is the tangent plane of the k-manifold
through p. The Frobenius Theorem says that
 is integrable if and only if, whenever X and
Y are vector ﬁelds deﬁned in a neighborhood of
P such that X(Q) and Y(Q) lie in (Q), then
the Lie bracket [X, Y](Q) also lies in (Q).

tween its base and a plane parallel to the base.

See subcategory.
function 
If X and Y are sets, then a function
from X to Y is a relation f ⊆X × Y (often
written f : X →Y) with the property that
(x, y), (x, z) ∈f implies y = z. It is stan-
dard to write f (x) = y when (x, y) ∈f . See
relation.
function space 
(1) Let X and Y be topolog-
ical spaces. The function space Y X is the set
of all continuous maps from X into Y. This
space can be given several topologies, the most
common being the compact-open topology. See
compact-open topology.
(2) Any topological space whose elements
are functions on some common domain.

fundamental cycle
then the functor is assumed to be covariant. See
covariant functor.
fundamental cycle 
If M is a compact, ori-
entable manifold of dimension n, then the n-
dimensional homology of M is an inﬁnite cyclic
group. A generator of Hn(M) is a fundamental
cycle. If M is a polyhedral manifold, then the
fundamental cycle in simplicial homology can
be given by the n-chain which is the sum of the
n-simplices. See homology group.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic 
If n
is an integer greater than 1, then n is either a
prime number or can be expressed as a product
of prime numbers, uniquely, except for order.
For example, 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 and 30 =
2 × 3 × 5.
Fundamental Theorem of the Theory of
Curves 
A curve in Euclidean space R3 is
uniquely determined up to rigid motion by its
geodesic curvature κ and torsion τ, as func-
tions of its arc length parameter s. More pre-
cisely, given two continuous functions κ(s) and
τ(s) of one real variable such that κ > 0, and
given initial values X(0) and X′(0) in R3 with
|X′(0)| = 1, there is a unique curve X(s) whose
curvature is κ and torsion is τ. κ is usually taken
to be continuously differentiable and X then has
three continuous derivatives.
Fundamental Theorem of the Theory of Sur-
faces 
Let S be a surface in Euclidean three-
space parameterized by
X(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)) ,
where x, y, and z are assumed to have con-
tinuous third-order partial derivatives. Then S
possesses a ﬁrst fundamental form g and a sec-
ond fundamental form L satisfying the Gauss
equations and the Codazzi-Mainardi equations.
The fundamental theorem of the theory of sur-
faces states the converse, namely, if g(u, v) is
a positive deﬁnite symmetric tensor (i.e., an in-
ner product), and L(u, v) is a symmetric tensor,
with g having continuous second derivatives and
L having continuous ﬁrst derivatives, and if g
and L satisfy the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi
equations, then they (locally) determine a sur-
face S uniquely up to rigid motion. See ﬁrst
fundamental form, Gauss equations, Codazzi-
Mainardi equations.

geodesic correspondence
G
Gδ set 
A countable intersection of open sets.
See Fσ set.
Gauss equations 
A system of partial dif-
ferential equations arising in the theory of sur-
faces. If M is a surface in R3 with local coor-
dinates (u1, u2), its geometric invariants can be
described by its ﬁrst fundamental form
gij(u1, u2), and second fundamental form
Lij(u1, u2). The Christoffel symbols k
ij are
determined by the ﬁrst fundamental form. In
order for functions gij and Lij , i, j = 1, 2 to
be the ﬁrst and second fundamental forms of
a surface, certain integrability conditions (aris-
ing from equality of mixed partial derivatives)
must be satisﬁed. One set of conditions, the
Gauss equations, relate the determinant of the
second fundamental form to an expression in-
volving only the ﬁrst fundamental form (and its
ﬁrst and second partial derivatives). See also
Christoffel symbols, ﬁrst fundamental form.
general Cantor set 
A Cantor set in which
intervals of length α
3n are removed at stage n for
0 < α < 1. The resulting set, Cα = ∩∞
n=1In,
is a closed set with length 1 −α which forms a
totally disconnected compact topological space
in which every element is a limit point of the set.
See Cantor set.
generalized continuum hypothesis 
The
statement
2ℵα = ℵα+1
for all ordinals α. (Both this statement and
its negation are independent of the axioms of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of
Choice.) See continuum hypothesis.
generalized Riemann hypothesis 
An asser-
tion concerning the zeros of functions that are
similar to the Riemann zeta function. These
functions are called L-functions and are deﬁned
as
L(s, χ) =
∞

n=1
χ(n)
ns
where χ is a Dirichlet character, that is, a real or
complex valued function deﬁned on the positive
integers so that
(i.) χ(mn) = χ(m)χ(n) for all m and n;
(ii.) there is a positive integer k so that χ(n+
k) = χ(n) for all n;
(iii.) χ(n) = 0 if gcd(n, k) > 1.
ThegeneralizedRiemannhypothesisconjectures
that all zeros of the function L(s, χ) on the “crit-
ical strip” (those complex numbers s = x + iy
such that 0 < x < 1) must lie on the “critical
line”(x = 1
2 ). NoticethatL(s, 1) = ζ(s), sothe
generalized Riemann hypothesis “agrees with”
the Riemann hypothesis. See also Riemann zeta
function, Riemann Hypothesis.
General Position Theorem
A name given
to a number of theorems asserting, for various
classes of maps of spaces X into spaces Y, that
such maps may be approximated by maps hav-
ing simpler structure.
These “generic” maps
usually have minimum possible dimensionality
of intersections or self-intersections. A simple
example is the statement that two afﬁne sub-
spaces of dimensions k and l in n-dimensional
space can be perturbed so that they intersect in
a subspace of dimension n −(k + l).
generating curve
A surface of revolution in
Euclidean space can be parameterized by
X(t, θ) = (r(t) cos(θ), r(t) sin(θ), z(t)) ,
where r(t) > 0 and z(t) are continuous func-
tions. The curve σ(t) = (r(t), z(t)) is the gen-
erating curve of the surface.
geodesic
In a manifold with metric (non-
degenerate smoothly varying quadratic form on
each tangent space), a curve of minimal length
between two points. An example of geodesics
are arcs of great circles on a sphere.
geodesic correspondence
A smooth map
φ : S −→S′ between two surfaces which takes
geodesics of S to geodesics of S′. An isometric
mapping is automatically a geodesic correspon-
dence, but the converse is not true.
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

geodesic curvature
An example of a geodesic correspondence is
given by central projection of the hemisphere
z =

1 −x2 −y2 totheplanez = 1. Greatcir-
cle arcs in the hemisphere correspond to straight
lines in the plane under this projection.
geodesic curvature 
If C is a curve lying on
a surface S in Euclidean space R3, parameter-
ized by unit speed, then its second derivative or
acceleration vector C′′ is perpendicular to the
velocity vector C′. The length of the compo-
nent of C′′ tangent to the surface is the geodesic
curvature of the curve. It measures the amount
of bending the curve undergoes within the sur-
face, as opposed to the amount of bending due
to the bending of the surface itself.
geometric realization 
Let S be an abstract
simplicial complex. If S is isomorphic to the
vertex scheme of a simplicial complex K, then
K is the geometric realization of S. The geo-
metric realization of an abstract simplicial com-
plex is unique up to isomorphism.
geometry on a surface 
The measurement of
lengths of curves, angles between curves, and
areas of ﬁgures lying on a surface. This is also
called intrinsic geometry, to distinguish it from
properties of a surface that depend on how the
surface sits in space.
Gödel number 
A Gödel numbering (arith-
metization)isaneffectivemethodofcodingnon-
numerical objects by natural numbers. For ex-
ample, there is a computable bijection from the
set T of all Turing machine programs to the set
of natural numbers. The inverse of this bijec-
tion is also computable, so that, given a Turing
machine program, one can effectively ﬁnd the
natural number assigned to it, which is called
the Gödel number of the program, and given a
natural number, one can effectively “decode” it
in order to ﬁnd the Turing machine program that
corresponds to it. The notation ϕe is used to de-
note the Turing computable partial function with
Gödel number e; i.e., ϕe is Turing computable
via the Turing program with Gödel number e.
Gödel was the ﬁrst to use Gödel numbers in his
proof of his Incompleteness Theorem.

set theory. See Bernays-Gödel set theory.
great circle 
A circle on a sphere formed by
intersecting the sphere with a plane that passes
through the center of the sphere. If P and Q are
two points on the sphere, then a curve of least
length joining P to Q is an arc of a great circle.
See also geodesic.
greatest common divisor
(1) If a and b are
nonzero integers, then the greatest common di-
visor of a and b, denoted gcd(a, b) is the largest
integer that is a divisor of both a and b. For
example, the greatest common divisor of 28 and
36 is 4 (the common divisors of 28 and 36 are
±1, ±2, and ±4).
(2) Alternatively,
in a Euclidean ring,
R, gcd(a, b) is an element (not necessarily
unique) d of R satisfying
(i.) d is a divisor of both a and b;
(ii.) if x is a divisor of a and b, then x is also
a divisor of d.
greatest element
Given a set A with an or-
dering ≤on A, an element u ∈A is said to be a
greatest element of A if, for all x ∈A, x ≤u.
Note that if A has a greatest element, then it is
unique. Compare with least element.
greatest lower bound
Let A be an ordered
set and let B ⊆A. An element l ∈A is said
to be a greatest lower bound (or inﬁmum) for B
if it is a lower bound for B (i.e., for all x ∈B,
l ≤x) and if it is the greatest element in the set
of all lower bounds for B (i.e., for all y ∈A, if
for all x ∈B, y ≤x, then y ≤l). Note that if a
set has a greatest lower bound, then it is unique.
Compare with least upper bound.
group
A non-empty set G with a product
map G × G −→G ((g, h) is taken to gh), an
inverse map G −→G (g is taken to g−1), and a
distinguished element called the identity (often
denoted 0, 1, or e) satisfying ge = eg = g,
for g ∈G. These satisfy the relationships that
g1(g2g3) = (g1g2)g3 and gg−1 = e = g−1g.

group of symmetries
group of motions 
A group of length-
preserving transformations, or rigid motions, in
Euclidean n-space. A group is a non-empty set
with a binary associative operation that contains
an identity and an inverse of each one of its ele-
ments. The rigid motions of the Euclidean plane
are translations, rotations, reﬂections, and glide-
reﬂections.

A connected unbounded and proper
subset of a line in Euclidean space. Also called
a ray. See also closed half line.
half plane 
(1) (Open) One of the two con-
nected sets remaining after deleting a line from
a plane.
(2) (Closed) An open half plane, together
with the deleted line. Example: On the Carte-
sian plane an open half plane is the set {(x, y) :
ax +by +c > 0} where (a, b) ̸= (0, 0), a and c
areconstant, thecorrespondingclosedhalfplane
is the set {(x, y) : ax + by + c ≥0}.
half space 
One of the two connected sets
remaining after deleting from a sphere its inter-

haltingproblem 
Informally, thehaltingprob-
lem asks if there is an effective procedure which,
given an arbitrary effective procedure and input
a natural number n, answers “yes” if that pro-
gram on input n halts, and outputs “no” other-
wise.
Formally, the halting set K0 is the set of codes
of pairs of natural numbers (e, x) such that the
partial recursive function with Gödel number
e is deﬁned on input x; i.e., K0 = {⟨e, x⟩:
ϕe(x) is deﬁned}, where ϕe is the partial recur-
sive function with Gödel number e. The halt-
ing set is not recursive (computable), as a set
of natural numbers, although it is recursively
(computably) enumerable. Another halting set
is K = {e : ϕe(e) is deﬁned}. The set K is also
computably (recursively) enumerable but non–
computable (non–recursive).
Hausdorff Maximal Principle 
Every chain
in a partially ordered set can be extended to a
maximal chain. This principle is provable in
ZFC, and it is provably equivalent to the Axiom
of Choice and Zorn’s Lemma in ZF.
Hausdorff metric 
Let (X, d) be a metric
space. If A ⊂X and ϵ > 0, let U(A, ϵ) be
the ϵ-neighborhood of A. That is,
U(A, ϵ) = ∪a∈AB(a, ϵ)
where B(a, ϵ) = {x ∈X : d(x, a) < ϵ}.
Let H denote the collection of all (non-empty)
closed, bounded subsets of X. If A, B ∈H
then the Hausdorff Metric on H is deﬁned by

Hausdorff topological space 
A topological
space X such that, for each pair of distinct points
x, y ∈X, there exist open neighborhoods U and
V of x and y, respectively, such that U ∩V = ∅.
Also called T2-space. See separation axioms.
height (of a tree)
The least ordinal α such
that the αth level of a given tree T is empty. That
is, α is the ﬁrst ordinal for which there is no el-
ement in T whose predecessors have order type

homotopy equivalence between the pairs (X, A)
and (Y, B) is a pair of functions f : (X, A) →
(Y, B) and g : (Y, B) →(X, A), such that g ◦f
is homotopic to the identity map iX of X and
f ◦g is homotopic to the identity map iY of Y.
homology group 
Let n be a positive inte-
ger, X a topological space, and x a point in
X. Then the nth homotopy group πn(X, x) is
deﬁned to be the group of homotopy classes
of maps of the standard sphere Sn to X tak-
ing a ﬁxed base point ∗of Sn to x.
In the
case n = 1, this is the fundamental group of
X (with base point x), with concatenation of
loops inducing the group operation. In dimen-
sions higher than 1, the group operation turns
out to be commutative. Another way of deﬁning
πn(X, x) is to take homotopy classes of maps of
[0, 1]n to X taking the boundary to x. With this
deﬁnition, it is easier to deﬁne the group oper-
ation by concatenation: f + g : [0, 1]n −→
X is deﬁned by: f + g(t1, t2, . . . , tn) equals
f (2t1, t2, . . . , tn) for 0 ≤t ≤1
2, and it equals
g(2t1 −1, t2, . . . , tn) for 1
2 ≤t1 ≤1.
homology theory 
A homology theory on a
category T of pairs of topological spaces (X, A)
consists of
(i.)
a functor Hp from T to the category
of Abelian groups A for each integer p ≥0,
where the image of the pair (X, A) is denoted
by Hp(X, A) and
(ii.) a natural transformation
∂p : Hp(X, A) →Hp−1(A)
for each integer p ≥0, where A denotes the pair
(A, ∅), whichsatisfytheEilenberg-SteenrodAx-
ioms. See Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms.

form a group under composition, which con-
tains all isometries and the dilations given by
f (x, y) = (ax, ay), a ̸= 0.
homotopy type of a space 
Let T denote
the category of all pairs (X, A) of topological
spaces, whereX isidentiﬁedwiththepair(X, ∅).
The homotopy type of the pair (X, A) is the
equivalence class
[(X, A)] = {(Y, B) : (Y, B)
is homotopy equivalent to (X,A)} .
Hopf bundle 
The bundle S1 −→S3 −→
S2 formed as follows. Consider S3 as the unit
sphere in C2 (where C denotes the complex
numbers). The sphere S2 is given by CP1, the
space of complex lines in C2, by identifying
the line through the point (z1, z2) with the point
z2/z1 in C when z1 ̸= 0 and identifying C with
the sphere less one point; the complex line given
by points (0, z2) is identiﬁed with the remaining
point on S2. The projection S3 −→S2 is given
by the map which sends (z1, z2) to the complex
line through (z1, z2) (thought of as a point of
CP1 identiﬁed with a point in S2). Each ﬁber is
homeomorphic to S1.
Using quaternions and Cayley numbers in-
stead of complex numbers, one can deﬁne anal-
ogous bundles S7 −→S4 and S15 −→S8 with
ﬁbers S3 and S7, respectively. All three bundles
are called Hopf bundles.
hyperbolic paraboloid 
One of the quadratic
surfaces in R3. Since a symmetric matrix over
the reals is congruent to one in diagonal form,
the (non-degenerate) quadric surfaces are clas-
siﬁed, by the sign of their eigenvalues and the
conﬁguration of their points at inﬁnity into el-
lipsoids, hyperboloids, elliptic paraboloids, and
hyperbolic paraboloids, the latter having canon-
ical equation 2z
c = x2
a2 −y2
b2 for some non-zero
constants a, b, c.
hyperbolic plane 
A plane satisfying the ax-
ioms of hyperbolic geometry, which comprise
Hilbert’saxiomsofplanegeometryandthe“char-
acteristic axiom of hyperbolic geometry”: for
any line l and point p not on l, there are at
least two lines on p not meeting l. A model
of the hyperbolic plane is given by the unit disc
D = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : x2 + y2 < 1}, with the
Poincaré metric ds2 =
dx2+dy2
(1−(x2+y2)/4)2 , the lines
being geodesic.
hyperboloid 
One of the quadric surfaces in
R3, like the hyperbolic paraboloid. See hyper-
bolic paraboloid. The canonical equation for the
hyperboloid of one sheet is x2
a2 −y2
b2 + z2
c2 = 1
and that for the hyperboloid of two sheets is
x2
a2 −y2
b2 −z2
c2 = 1, where a, b, c are non-zero
constants. As the name suggests, one difference
between the two cases is that one surface con-
sists of one connected component, the other of
two.
hyperelliptic surface 
A Riemann surface X,
namely a compact complex manifold of dimen-
sion 1, which generalizes the complex torus, in
the following sense: there exists a holomorphic
map X → P1 of degree 2, with 2g + 2 branch
points where 2 −2g is the Euler characteristic
of the topological surface X. See compact com-
plex manifold, complex torus. The number g
is called the genus of the surface. Also called
elliptic curve, in the case of genus 1.
hyperplane 
In n-dimensional (afﬁne or pro-
jective) space of dimension n, a subspace of di-
mension n −1.
hyperplane at inﬁnity 
In n-dimensional pro-
jective space Pn, with given coordinate system
(x0 : x1 : . . . : xn), a hyperplane H, typically
given by the equation x0 = 0. The complement
Pn\H can thus be identiﬁed with afﬁne n-space
An with coordinates ( x1
x0 , . . . xn
x0 ).
hypersurface 
In afﬁne or projective space, a
subset deﬁned by one (nonzero) algebraic equa-
tion in the coordinates. A hyperplane is an ex-
ample of hypersurface, which is deﬁned by one
linear equation. See also hyperplane.

posite the right angle. It is the longest side of
the triangle.

Let S be a nonempty set and let P(S)
be the power set of S. A set I ⊆P(S) is an
ideal on S if
(i.) ∅∈I
(ii.) for all X, Y ∈I, X ∪Y ∈I,
(iii.) for all X, Y, if X ∈I and Y ⊆X, then
Y ∈I.
As an example, let S be the set N of natural
numbers and let I be the set of all ﬁnite subsets
of N. Then I is an ideal on S.
identiﬁcation map 
A continuous onto map-
ping f : X →Y such that the topology on Y is
the identiﬁcation topology; that is, U is open in
Y if and only if f −1(U) is open in X. See also
quotient map.
identiﬁcation space 
An identiﬁcation space
of a topological space X is a set Y endowed
with the topology induced by an onto mapping
f : X →Y. This topology (the identiﬁcation
topology) is given by: U ⊆Y is open if and
only if f −1(U) is open in X. See also quotient
space.

identity function 
The arithmetic function,
denotedI, whichhasthevalue1whenn = 1and
has the value 0 when n > 1, i.e., I(n) = ⌊1
n⌋,
the ﬂoor function applied to 1
n . It is completely
(and strongly) multiplicative. This function is
the identity under Dirichlet multiplication. See
arithmetic function, Dirichlet multiplication.
image 
Let f : A →B be a function, and
let x ∈A. The image of x under f is f (x), the
unique element of B to which x is mapped by
f . Given a subset C ⊆A, the image of C under
f is
f (C)
=
{f (x) : x ∈C}
=
{y ∈B : (∃x ∈C)[f (x) = y]}.
imaginary axis 
The y-axis, which corre-
sponds to the purely imaginary numbers in the
Argand diagram for the complex numbers,
namely the identiﬁcation of x + iy ∈ C with
the point (x, y) ∈ R2.
imbedding 
A one-to-one continuous map f :
X →Y, between topological spaces, for which
the restriction f ∗: X →f (X) to its range is a
homeomorphism. Here
f (X) =

y ∈Y : ∃x ∈X (f (x) = y)

and f ∗ is required not only to be one-to-one,
onto, and continuous, but to have a continuous
inverse.
immersed submanifold 
The image f (M)
of an immersion f : M →N between two
manifolds. Each point in M has a neighborhood
on which f is an embedding. However, the map
f need not be an embedding, so f (M) need not
be a manifold with the induced topology as a
subset of N, even if f is globally 1-1. A simple
example is given by the immersion of the open
interval into the plane whose image is the ﬁgure
6. A more complicated example is given by
viewing the torus as the quotient of the plane
by the integer lattice. Then a line of irrational
slope is mapped onto a dense subset of the torus,
which is an immersed submanifold.
inaccessible cardinal (strongly) 
A cardinal
κ which is uncountable, regular, and satisﬁes
the condition 2α < κ for all α < κ, i.e., κ
is a strong limit cardinal. (Any strongly inac-
cessible cardinal is weakly inaccessible since a
strong limit cardinal is a limit cardinal. The ex-
istence of strongly inaccessible cardinals cannot
be proved in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with
the Axiom of Choice.) See regular cardinal.

which is uncountable, a regular cardinal, and a
limit cardinal. (The existence of weakly inac-
cessible cardinals cannot be proved in Zermelo-

incenter of triangle
As seen in the deﬁnition of inaccessible cardi-
nal (strongly), every strongly inaccessible car-
dinal is weakly inaccessible. [See inaccessible
cardinal (strongly).] If one assumes the gener-
alized continuum hypothesis, then the converse
is true.) See regular cardinal, limit cardinal.
incenter of triangle 
The center of the unique
circle which can be inscribed in a given triangle.
It is located at the intersection of the internal
bisectors of the three vertices of the triangle.
incommensurable 
Two line segments XY
and X′Y ′ such that there is no line segment AB
with the property that each of XY and X′Y ′ has
length that is an exact (integer) multiple of the
length of AB. That is, there is no unit of mea-
sure with respect to which both segments have
integer length.
For example, the hypotenuse of an isosceles
right triangle and a leg of the triangle are incom-
mensurable because
√
2 is an irrational number.
incomparable (elements of a partial order-
ing) 
If (P, ≤) is a partially ordered set, x, y ∈
P are incomparable if neither x ≤y, nor y ≤x.
incompatible (elements of a partial ordering)
See compatible (elements of a partial ordering).
inconsistent 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language
and let  be a set of well-formed formulas of L.
The set  is inconsistent if there exists a well-
formed formula α such that both α and (¬α)
are provable from  (i.e., both α and (¬α) are
theorems of ). If  is inconsistent, then in fact
every formula is a theorem of .
inconsistent axioms 
A set of axioms such
that there is a statement A such that both A and
its negation are provable from the axioms. See
also inconsistent. For example, in set theory, the
axioms AC (the Axiom of Choice) and AD (the
Axiom of Determinacy) are inconsistent, as the
Axiom of Determinacy contradicts the Axiom
of Choice.
indiscernible 
A subset I of a model A is a
set of indiscernibles if no ﬁrst-order formula can
distinguish between increasing sequences from
I. More precisely, if < is any linear order on I
and n ∈ N, then for all a1 < a2 < · · · < an and
b1 < b2 < · · · < bn in I, A |= φ(¯a) if and only
if A |= φ(¯b) for all L-formulas φ.
induction 
One of two techniques used to
prove that a given proposition P is true for all
natural numbers. Let P(n) denote the statement
“P is true for the natural number n”. The prin-
ciple of weak induction states that if
(i.) P(0)
(ii.) P(m) implies P (m + 1) for any natural
number M,
then P (n) for all natural numbers n. The prin-
ciple of strong induction states that if (i.) and
(ii.) P(0), P (1), . . . , P (m)  implies P (m + 1)
for any natural number m, then P(n) is true for
any natural number n. The proof technique in
the principle of strong induction may be gen-
eralized to any well-ordered set W, giving the
principle of transﬁnite induction.
inductive set 
A set A such that ∅∈A, and
for all sets x, if x ∈A then x+ ∈A, where
x+ = x ∪{x} is the successor of the set x.
inﬁmum 
Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered
set and suppose that Y ⊆X. An element z ∈X
is an inﬁmum, or greatest lower bound, of Y
(denoted inf(Y) or glb(Y)) if z is a lower bound
for Y and r ≤z for any other element r which
is a lower bound for Y. See lower bound.
inﬁnitecontinuedfraction 
Acontinuedfrac-
tion that is not ﬁnite. See continued fraction,
ﬁnite continued fraction.
inﬁnite dimensional projective space
A
space in projective geometry, which generalizes
the n-dimensional projective space Pn. Over a
ﬁeld k, the points of Pn can be coordinatized by
(n + 1)-tuples (x0 : x1 : . . . : xn) where xi ∈k
and at least one xi ̸= 0, up to the equivalence
relation (x0 : . . . : xn) ∼(λx0 : . . . : λxn) for
0 ̸= λ ∈k. The classical examples are the real
projective space (k = R) and complex projec-
tive space (k = C). The inﬁnite dimensional
projective space can be constructed as a direct
limit
lim→Pn = P∞,
namely a collection of injections πi : Pi →P∞
with the property that πj = πi ◦ρij, where

interior angle
ρij : Pj → Pi is the natural inclusion (x0 : . . . :
xj) →(x0 : . . . : xj : 0 : . . . : 0) for j < i.
inﬁnite Grassmann manifold 
A Grassmann
manifold is the set of all subspaces of a vector
space V that have a given dimension k. When V
is a real (or complex) vector space, this set is in-
deed a real (or complex) manifold. If the dimen-
sion of V is n, the dimension of the Grassmann
manifold is k(n −k). An inﬁnite Grassmann
manifold is a generalization of this object for V
of inﬁnite dimension, but for it to be a manifold,
care must be taken that there exist local coordi-
nates. Typically, the condition for a subspace W
to be a point of an inﬁnite Grassmann manifold
is that it be commensurable to a ﬁxed subspace
H of V , in a suitable sense, either involving the
dimensions of (H + W)/H and W/(H ∩W) or
some more analytic properties.
inﬁnite set 
Any set that is not ﬁnite. Equiv-
alently, an inﬁnite set is a set whose cardinality
is not a natural number. See ﬁnite set.
inﬁnite Stiefel manifold 
The inﬁnite Stiefel
manifold Vk ofk-framesisthedirectlimit(union)
of the spaces Vn,k of k-frames in real or com-
plex n-dimensional space. More precisely, let
F = R∞ (resp., C∞) denote the vector space of
inﬁnite sequences x = (x1, x2, ...) of real (resp.,
complex) numbers that have only ﬁnitely many
nonzero terms. Then the Stiefel manifold Vk(F)
ofk-framesinF istheopensubsetofF k consist-
ing of k-tuples of linearly independent vectors
in F.
inﬁnity 
The symbol ∞ was ﬁrst used by
the English mathematician John Wallis (1616-
1703) to denote inﬁnity. While not a number it-
self, ∞ is usually used to denote a quantity that
is larger than every number. There are a num-
ber of ways mathematicians have attempted to
“quantify” inﬁnity. For instance, a set S is ﬁ-
nite if there is a nonnegative integer n and a
bijection f : S →{1, 2, 3, . . . , n} (that is, if
S has n elements) and S is inﬁnite, otherwise.
Alternatively, a set is inﬁnite if there is a bijec-
tion from the set to a proper subset of itself. In
his theory of transﬁnite numbers, Georg Can-
tor dealt with various “sizes” of inﬁnity, dis-
tinguishing between countably and uncountably
inﬁnite sets, for example.
initial object 
An object I in a category C with
the property that, for any object X in C there
exists a unique morphism f ∈ HomC(I, X).
initial ordinal 
If α is an ordinal, let |α| de-
note the cardinality of {τ : τ < α}. The ini-
tial ordinal corresponding to a ﬁxed cardinal κ
is the minimum ordinal α such that |α| = κ.
For example, ω is the initial ordinal correspond-
ing to ℵ0 even though there are inﬁnitely many
different ordinals whose cardinality is ℵ0. See
ordinal.
initial segment 
A subset of a well-ordered
set W which has the form {x ∈W : x < w},
where w ∈W.
injection 
(1) A one-to-one function between
two sets X and Y. See one-to-one function.
(2) The function i : X →Y between two
sets X and Y, with X ⊆Y, deﬁned by i(x) = x.
See also function.
integer
An element of the set {. . . , −4, −3,
−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . }
consisting
of
all
whole numbers. The set of all integers is usually
denoted Z or Z.
integral curvature
If S is a surface in Eu-
clidean space and A is a measurable subset of S,
then the integral curvature of A is the area of its
image under the Gauss map to the unit sphere.
That is, it is the area of the set of unit vectors
that are outer normals to support planes of the
surface at points of A.
For smooth surfaces,
it can be computed intrinsically by integrating
the Gaussian curvature over the region A. For
a polyhedron, the integral curvature is concen-
trated at the vertices.
interiorangle
IfP isasimpleclosedpolygon
enclosing a region R, then the interior angle at
a vertex V is measured by the magnitude of the
rotation that carries one edge of P adjacent to V
to the other edge, the rotation performed within
R.

interior of closed curve
interior of closed curve 
The bounded com-
ponent of the complement of a simple closed
curve. By the Jordan Curve Theorem, the com-
plement of the curve consists of exactly two con-
nected components.
interior of polygon 
The bounded component
of the complement of a polygon P , which, as a
curve, is closed and has no self-intersections.
Any two points in the interior can be joined by
a continuous curve that does not intersect P ,
while any two points in the other component of
the complement of P (the exterior of the poly-
gon) can be joined by a continuous curve that
does not intersect P . But no point in the interior
can be joined to any point in the exterior by a
continuous curve that does not intersect P . This
fact is the content of the Jordan Curve Theorem
for polygons.
interior of polyhedron 
A closed connected
polyhedral surface in Euclidean space R3 has a
complement consisting of two path-connected
components. One of these two, the bounded
component, is called the interior of the polyhe-
dron.
intersection of sets 
If X and Y are sets, then
the intersection of X and Y, denoted X∩Y, is the
set consisting of all elements that are common to
both X and Y. Symbolically, X ∩Y = {z : z ∈
X and z ∈Y}. More generally, if {Xα}α∈ is a
family of sets, then the intersection 
α∈ Xα is
the set consisting of all elements that are com-
mon to all Xα. See also Boolean algebra, lattice.
inverse correspondence 
See inverse func-
tion.
inverse function 
Let X, Y be sets and sup-
pose that f ⊆X × Y is a function. If f is
one-to-one (f (x1) = f (x2) implies x1 = x2),
then the inverse function f −1 is the unique func-
tion obtained by interchanging the coordinates
in the ordered pairs belonging to f . Symboli-
cally, f −1 = {(y, x) : (x, y) ∈f }. It can be
veriﬁed that f −1f (x) = x and ff −1(y) = y
for all x ∈X and all y in the range of f . The
function f −1 is also one-to-one and its inverse
satisﬁes (f −1)−1 = f . If f is not one-to-one,
then f −1 is not a function. See function.
inverse morphism 
Suppose that C is a cat-
egory. If f ∈ HomC(A, B) is an invertible
function, then the inverse morphism f −1 is the
unique morphism in HomC(B, A) satisfying
(i.) ff −1 = 1B,
(ii.)f −1f = 1A.
inverse relation 
Let X, Y be sets and sup-
pose that R ⊆X × Y is a relation. The inverse
relation R−1 is the relation obtained by inter-
changing the coordinates of all ordered pairs in
R. Symbolically, R−1 = {(y, x) ∈Y × X :
(x, y) ∈R}. See relation.
involute
A curve associated with a given
curve C as follows: the tangent lines to the curve
form a surface, an involute is a curve on this sur-
face which is orthogonal to the tangent lines. If
C is parameterized by arc length s, then the invo-
lutes are given by Ic(s) = C(s)+(c−s)C′(s), c
a constant.
involution
A transformation that is its own
inverse.
In geometry, the reﬂection across a
straight line is an involution of the plane.
irrational number
A real number that is not
rational. That is, a real number that cannot be
expressed as a quotient of integers. Examples of
irrational numbers are π, e (the base of the nat-
ural logarithm),
√
2, and
√
6 (in fact, the square
root of any integer, other than a perfect square,
will be irrational).
irreduciblequadraticpolynomial
Thepoly-
nomial ax2 + bx + c with real coefﬁcients is
irreducible (over the ﬁeld of real numbers) if
it cannot be expressed as the product of two
non-constant polynomials with real coefﬁcients.
This occurs if and only if b2 −4ac < 0.
Any polynomial with real coefﬁcients can be
factored (using only real coefﬁcients) into the
product of linear factors and irreducible qua-
dratic polynomials.
irreﬂexive relation
A relation R ⊆X × X
on a set X such that there is no x ∈X with
(x, x) ∈R. For example, if R consists of all
ordered pairs of real numbers (a, b) such that
a < b, then R is irreﬂexive.

isosceles triangle
isolated point 
A point x in a topological
space X such that the singleton set {x} is open
in X. Equivalently, x /∈X \ {x}. Thus, x is iso-
lated in X if and only if it is not an accumulation
point in X.
More generally, x is an isolated point of a
subset A ⊆X if x ∈A and there is an open
U ⊆X with U ∩A = {x}. That is, x /∈A \ {x},
and so x is an isolated point of A if and only if
it is in A but is not an accumulation point of A.
isometric surfaces 
Two surfaces S and S′,
for which there is a bijection from S to S′, which
takes every curve in S to a curve in S′ of the
same length. Assuming the surfaces are dif-
ferentiable, they are isometric if there is a dif-
feomorphism from S to S′ which pulls the ﬁrst
fundamental form of S′ back to the ﬁrst funda-
mental form of S. See ﬁrst fundamental form.
isomorphicorderings 
Twoorderings(X, ≤)
and (X′, ≤′) such that there exists a bijection
from X to X′ which is order-preserving. More
precisely, the orderings are isomorphic if there is
a bijection f : X →X′ such that if x1, x2 ∈X
and x1 ≤x2, then f (x1) ≤′ f (x2).
isomorphism 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language,
and let A and B be structures for L, where A and
B are the universes of A and B, respectively.
A function h : A →B is an isomorphism of
structures if h is injective and surjective, and
(i.) for each n-ary predicate symbol P and
every a1, . . . an ∈A,
(a1, . . . , an) ∈P A
⇔(h(a1), . . . , h(an)) ∈P B ,
(ii.) for each constant symbol c,
h(cA) = cB,
and
(iii.) for each n-ary function symbol f and
every a1 . . . , an ∈A,
h(f A(a1, . . . , an)) = f B(h(a1), . . . , h(an)).
If there is an isomorphism of A onto B, then
A and B are isomorphic structures (notation:
A ∼= B).
isoperimetric 
For two curves, C and C′, the
property of having the same length. The isoperi-
metric inequality in the plane states that, among
all curves isoperimetric to a given simple closed
curve C, the circle encloses the maximum area.
isosceles 
An isosceles polygon is a polygon
possessing two sides of the same length. The
term is usually applied to triangles or trapezoids.
In the case of a trapezoid, the sides are generally
taken to be opposite sides.
isosceles triangle
A triangle possessing two
sides of equal length. See also isosceles.

Kleinian group 
A subgroup G of the group

that there exists some point z of the extended

i.e., the stabilizer Gz is ﬁnite, and there exists a
neighborhood U of z which is ﬁxed by all the
elements of Gz, but whose only ﬁxed point un-
der any element of Gz is z. See linear fractional

Kodaira dimension 
A rational invariant of
a smooth projective variety V , named after the
Japanese mathematician Kunihiko Kodaira. It
is the maximum of the dimensions of φn(V ),
where φn is the rational map associated to the
nth power of the canonical bundle, over all pos-
itive integers n for which this power has global
sections. If no such n exists, the Kodaira dimen-
sion is deﬁned to be −∞.
k-perfect number 
A positive integer n hav-
ing the property that the sum of its positive di-
visors is kn, i.e., σ(n) = kn. Thus, a 2-perfect
number is the same as a perfect number. The
smallest 3-perfect number is 120. The smallest
4-perfect number is 30,240.
Kurepa tree 
A tree of height ω1 with no
uncountable levels but at least ω2 uncountable
branches. Thus, for each α < ω1, the α-level of

is countable, Levω1(T ) is the ﬁrst empty level of
T , and there are at least ω2 different sets B ⊆T

able. Kurepa’s Hypothesis (KH) is that there ex-
ists a Kurepa tree, but KH is independent of the
axioms of set theory. In fact, KH is independent
of ZFC+GCH.
For any regular cardinal κ, a κ-Kurepa tree
is a tree of height κ in which all levels have size
less than κ and there are at least κ+ branches
with length κ. See also Aronszajn tree, Suslin

A non-empty set X, together with two
binary operations ∪, ∩on X (called union and
intersection, respectively), which satisfy the fol-
lowing conditions for all A, B, C ∈X:
(i.) (A ∪B) ∪C = A ∪(B ∪C);

A manifold that is a maximal integral
submanifold of an integrable distribution. Gi-
ven a manifold M, a distribution  assigns to
each point P in M a k-dimensional subspace of
thetangentspaceatP. Itisintegrableiftheman-
ifold is the union of k-dimensional immersed
submanifolds, such that the k-plane (p) is the
tangent plane of the k-manifold through p. A
leaf is a maximal connected integral submani-
fold of the distribution.
least common multiple 
For two nonzero
integers a and b, the smallest positive integer
L that is a multiple of both a and b, is de-
noted LCM(a, b). Equivalently, LCM(a, b) is
the unique positive integer that is a multiple
of both a and b and is a divisor of all other
common multiples of a and b. For example,
LCM(14, 8) = 56 and LCM(3, 5) = 15. Note
that the least common multiple of two nonzero
integers will always be a divisor of the product
of the two integers. In fact, the product of the
greatest common divisor and the least common
multiple of two integers is the product of the two
integers (i.e., ab = gcd(a, b) · LCM(a, b).) See
greatest common divisor.
least element
Given a set A with an ordering
≤on A, an element l ∈A is said to be a least
element of A if, for all x ∈A, l ≤x. Note
that if A has a least element, then it is unique.
Compare with greatest element.
least upper bound
Let A be an ordered set
and let B ⊆A. An element u ∈A is said to
be a least upper bound (or supremum) for B if
it is an upper bound for B (i.e., for all x ∈B,
x ≤u) and it is the least element in the set of
all upper bounds for B (i.e., for all y ∈A, if for
all x ∈B, x ≤y, then u ≤y). Note that if
a set has a least upper bound, then it is unique.
Compare with greatest lower bound.
left adjoint functor
Let C and D be cate-
gories with functors F : C −→D and G :
D −→C such that if X is an object of C and Y
isanobjectofD, wehaveabijectionofhom-sets
homC(X, G(Y)) = homD(F(X), Y)
which is natural in both X and Y. Then F is a
left adjoint for G and G is a right adjoint for F.
Example: The forgetful functor from Abel-
ian groups to sets which forgets the group struc-
ture has left adjoint given by taking the free
Abelian group on the elements of the set. Note
that this is not an “inverse” functor.

In a right triangle, either of the two sides

level (of a tree)
The αth level of a tree T ,
Levα(T ), is the set of all elements of T whose
predecessors have order type α. That is, for any
t ∈T , the set of predecessors of t, {s ∈T :
s < t}, must be well ordered, and the level of t
is given by their order type.
Lev0(T ) is the set of elements in T with no
predecessors, while Lev1(T ) is the set of ele-
ments with exactly one predecessor (which must
come from level 0).

tiable manifold and for which the product and

therefore a topological group). See topological

Example: Considertheunitcircleinthecom-
plex numbers, all points of the form eix for x
real. This is a Lie group.
Lie line-sphere transformation 
A corre-
spondence between lines in space R, say, and
spheres in a corresponding space S, named after
the Norwegian mathematician Marius Sophus
Lie. A point (X, Y, Z) ∈S determines a line in
R by the two equations:

(X + iY) −zZ −x = 0
z(X −iY) + Z −y = 0
For any ﬁxed line l in R, the set of such lines
that meet l corresponds to a sphere in S (whose
center and/or radius may be complex numbers).
limit cardinal 
A cardinal ℵα whose index α
is a limit ordinal. See limit ordinal.
limit ordinal 
An ordinal α that is not a suc-
cessorordinal. Therefore, α hastheformsup{β :
β < α} = 
β<α β. (It should be noted that 0 is
also a limit ordinal; we deﬁne sup ∅= 0.) See
successor ordinal, ordinal.
line bundle 
A term used in the theory of vec-
tor bundles. A vector bundle over a topological
space X consists of a space E called the total
space, a vector space F called the ﬁber, and a
map π : E −→X. The space X has a cover-
ing by open sets Ui with homeomorphisms φi
from Ei = π−1(Ui) to Ui × F. The projection
map π respects these product structures; i.e.,
π ◦φ−1
i
(x, V ) = x. When x ∈Ui ∩Uj, the map
gij(x) : F −→F deﬁned by (x, gij(x)(V )) =
φj(φ−1
i
(x, V )) is required to be linear.
This
implies that π−1(x) has the structure of a vec-
tor space.
A line bundle is a vector bundle
with one-dimensional ﬁber. Usually the ﬁeld is
either the real numbers or the complex numbers.
line of curvature 
A curve C on a surface,
having the property that, at each point C(t) on
the curve, the tangent vector C′(t) is a principal
vector of the surface at C(t), that is, an eigen-
vector of the Weingarten map.
line segment 
All points P on the line de-
termined by two given points A and B, lying
between A and B in the plane. For such a point
P, the points A and B lie on different rays from
P. This deﬁnition also makes sense in hyper-
bolic plane geometry but not in elliptic geom-
etry, where betweenness is not a well-deﬁned
concept.
linear fractional function 
A bijection of the
extended complex plane C ∪{∞} deﬁned by
z →az+b
cz+d for given complex numbers a, b, c, d
such that ad −bc ̸= 0. The inverse is given by
z →dz−b
cz−a . Also called Möbius transformation,
linear fractional transformation, linear transfor-
mation.
linearly ordered set 
A set A with a linear
ordering on A. See linear ordering.
linear ordering 
A partial ordering ≤on a set
A in which every pair of distinct elements of A
is comparable; i.e., for all x, y ∈A, if x ̸= y,
then x ≤y or y ≤x. If the partial ordering is
of the < type (see partial ordering), then < is a
linear ordering if, for all x, y ∈A, if x ̸= y,
then x < y or y < x.
The usual ordering ≤on Q, the set of rational
numbers, is a linear ordering.
A linear ordering is also called a total order-
ing.
link 
A link of n components in R3 is a sub-
set of R3 which is homeomorphic to n distinct
copies of S1. Individual components may be
knotted with themselves or with other compo-
nents.
More generally, a link of n components in
Rm+2 is an m embedding of a ﬁnite number
of copies of Sm in Rm+2 or Sm+2. Two links
L1, L2 are equivalent if there is a homeomor-
phism h : Rm+2 → Rm+2 (or h : Sm+2 →
Sm+2) such that h(L1) = L2.
linking number 
A numerical invariant of
links in 3 space which measures the number of
times pairs of components of a link wrap about
each other. See link.
For a link of 2 components L = α ∪β in R3,
the linking number of α with β, lk(α, β), is the
sum of the signed undercrossings of α with β in

logical consequence
a regular projection of α ∪β. The sign (±1) of
an undercrossing is determined by a choice of
an orientation at the undercrossings.
For example, the linking of a two-component
link (the Hopf link) is given in the ﬁgure with a
choice of undercrossing orientations.

Liouville’s function 
The arithmetic func-
tion, denoted λ, which, for any positive inte-
ger n = pi1

k , returns the number λ(n) =
(−1)i1+...+ik. (See arithmetic function.) For ex-
ample, λ(540) = λ(22 · 33 · 5) = (−1)6 = 1. It
is completely multiplicative.
locally n-connected topological space
A
topological space such that, for every point p,
every neighborhood of p contains a smaller
neighborhood of p which is n-connected.
A
connected topological space X is n-connec-
ted if for every k ≤n, every map of the k-
dimensional sphere into X is homotopic to a
constant map.
For example, any manifold is
locally n-connected for every n, as is every lo-
cally ﬁnite simplicial complex. The one point
union of inﬁnitely many n-spheres, with the
weak topology, is locally n −1-connected but
not locally n-connected.
logical connective
Used to build new propo-
sitional (sentential) or ﬁrst-order formulas from
existing ones.
The usual logical connectives
are ∧(and), ∨(or), ¬ (not), →(implies), and
↔(if and only if). For example, if A and B
are well-formed propositional formulas, then so
are (A ∧B), (A ∨B), (¬A), (A →B) and
(A ↔B).
The truth tables for these logical connectives
are as follows, where T is interpreted as true and
F is interpreted as false.

logical consequence
In propositional (sen-
tential) logic, a well-formed formula β is a log-
ical consequence of a well-formed formula α
if α logically implies β; i.e., if every truth as-
signment that satisﬁes α also satisﬁes β. For
example, if A and B are sentence symbols, then
A is a logical consequence of (A ∧B). In ad-
dition, β is a logical consequence of a set  of
well-formed formulas if  logically implies β;
i.e., if every truth assignment that satisﬁes every
member of  also satisﬁes β.

logically equivalent
For ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage, and let α and β be well-formed formulas
of L. Then β is a logical consequence of α if
α logically implies β; i.e., if, for every structure
A for L and for every s : V →A, whenever
A satisﬁes α with s, A also satisﬁes β with s.
(Here, V is the set of variables of L and A is
the universe of A.) In addition, β is a logical
consequence of a set  of well-formed formulas
of L if  logically implies β; i.e., if, for every
structure A for L and for every s : V →A,
whenever A satisﬁes every member of  with s,
A also satisﬁes β.
logically equivalent 
In propositional (sen-
tential) logic, well-formed formulas α and β
are logically equivalent if α logically implies
β and β logically implies α; that is, if every
truth assignment either satisﬁes both α and β,
or both ¬α and ¬β.
For example, if A and
B are sentence symbols, then (¬(A ∨B)) and
((¬A) ∧(¬B)) are logically equivalent.
For ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage, and let α and β be well-formed formulas
of L. Then α and β are logically equivalent if
α logically implies β and β logically implies α;
that is, if for every structure A for L and for ev-
ery s : V →A, A satisﬁes α with s if and only
if A satisﬁes β with s. (Here, V is the set of
variables of L and A is the universe of A.)
logically implies 
In propositional (senten-
tial)logic, awell-formedformulaα logicallyim-
plies another well-formed formula β (notation:
α |= β) if every truth assignment that satisﬁes
α also satisﬁes β. A set  of well-formed for-
mulas logically implies a well-formed formula
β (notation:  |= β) if every truth assignment
that satisﬁes every member of  also satisﬁes β.
For example, if A, B, and C are sentence sym-
bols,  = {A, (A →B)}, and β = B, then 
logically implies β. This notion in propositional
logic is called “tautologically implies” by some
authors.
For ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage, and let α and β be well-formed formu-
las of L. Then α logically implies β (notation:
α |= β) if, for every structure A for L and for
every s : V →A such that A satisﬁes α with
s, A also satisﬁes β with s. (Here, V is the set
of variables of L and A is the universe of A.)
A set  of well-formed formulas of L logically
implies a well-formed formula β of L (notation:
 |= β) if, for every structure A for L and for
every s : V →A such that A satisﬁes every
member of  with s, A also satisﬁes β with s.
Loop Theorem 
A theorem addressing the
conditions in which a loop in the boundary of a
three-dimensionalmanifoldwhichiscontractible
within the manifold has an equivalent embed-
ding which bounds a disk.
Speciﬁcally, let M be a compact three-
dimensional manifold and let N be a compo-
nent of its boundary. If the kernel of the homo-
morphism π1(N) →π1(M) is non-trivial, then
there exists a disk D2 ⊂M such that ∂D2 ⊂N
is a simple loop that is not homotopic to zero in
M.
lower bound 
Let S be a subset of a partially
ordered set (P, ≤). An element x ∈P is a lower
bound for S if x ≤s for all s ∈S.
lower limit topology 
See Sorgenfrey line.
Luzin space 
An uncountable regular topo-
logical space that has no isolated points and in
which every nowhere dense set is countable. A
Luzin space is hereditarily ccc and hereditar-
ily Lindelöf. (See countable chain condition.)
Because of this, Luzin spaces are related to L-
spaces, which are hereditarily Lindelöf but not
hereditarily separable.

Mangoldt function 
The arithmetic function,
denoted , which is deﬁned as follows: (n) =
log p if n = pi for some prime number p
and positive integer i, and (n) = 0 other-
wise. (See arithmetic function.) For example,
(8) = log 2, (15) = 0. This function plays
an important part in elementary proofs of the
prime number theorem.
manifold 
A topological space M with the
property that each point P possesses a neighbor-
hood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean space
Rn, for some n. If M is connected, the dimen-
sion n is constant, and M is an n-manifold. Usu-
ally, but not always, it is desirable to assume also
that M is Hausdorff and metrizable.
mapping 
See function.
mapping cylinder 
Given a map f : X →Y
between topological spaces, the mapping cylin-
der If of f is the quotient space of the disjoint
unionofX×[0, 1]andY obtainedbyidentifying
each point (x, 0) ∈X × 0 with f (x) ∈Y. The
space If is homotopy equivalent to Y and the
map f : X →Y is homotopically equivalent to
the natural inclusion i : X → If . The mapping
cylinder thus justiﬁes the statement that, in ho-
motopy theory, “every map is equivalent to an
inclusion.” There is also an algebraic version of
the mapping cylinder when X and Y are chain
complexes.
Martin’s Axiom (MA) 
If P is a partial order
with the countable chain condition and D is a
collection of fewer than continuum-many dense
subsets of P, there is a ﬁlter G ⊆P which meets
every D ∈D. That is, as long as P has no un-
countable collections of incompatible elements
(antichains), generic ﬁlters are able to meet any
set D of dense subsets with |D| < 2ω. In a par-
tial order, D ⊆P is dense if for any p ∈P there
is a q ∈D with q ≤p. A topological equivalent
is: if D is a collection of fewer than continuum-
many dense open sets of a compact Hausdorff
space X with the countable chain condition, then
∩D is dense in X.
For an inﬁnite cardinal κ, MAκ is the state-
ment that if D is a collection of dense subsets of
a ccc partial order P with |D| ≤κ, then there
is a ﬁlter G ⊆P such that G ∩D ̸= ∅for
each D ∈D. Thus, Martin’s Axiom (MA) is the
assertion that for all κ < 2ω, MAκ.
MAω is a theorem of ZFC, and so the Contin-
uum Hypothesis implies MA. However, MA is
also consistent with ¬CH. Some consequences
of MAω1 are Suslin’s Hypothesis (there are no
Suslin lines or trees), the union of ω1 measure
zero sets has measure zero, and the union of ω1
meager sets is meager.
mathematical induction 
See induction.
maximal element 
Given a set A and an or-
dering ≤ on A, m ∈A is said to be a maximal
element of A if there does not exist x ∈A with
m < x. Alternatively, m ∈A is a maximal el-
ement of A if, for all x ∈A, if m ≤x, then
m = x. Note that if A has a greatest or maxi-
mum element, then it is unique, and it is also the
unique maximal element of A. If A has no great-
est element, then A may have more than one, or
no, maximal elements. See greatest element.
maximum element 
A greatest element of a
set A with an ordering ≤. See greatest element.
mean curvature
The arithmetical mean of
the principal curvatures of the surface S at P . It
is half the trace of the second fundamental form
of the surface at P . (Some writers do not divide
by 2.) More generally, the mean curvature at P
in a hypersurface S of Rn+1 is 1
n times the trace
of the second fundamental form.

and x /∈S (x is not a member of S).

The equator is a meridian of the sphere S2.
Mersenne number 
A number of the form
Mn = 2n − 1, where n is a positive integer. De-
termining which Mersenne numbers are prime
has long interested mathematicians. See also
Mersenne prime.
Mersenne prime 
A number of the form Mn
= 2n − 1, where n is a positive integer, which
is prime. For example, M2 = 3 and M5 =
31 are Mersenne primes. If Mn is a Mersenne
prime, then n is prime. However, the converse
is not true: M11 = 23 · 89. In fact, Mersenne
primes are rare. There are currently 35 known
Mersenne primes, the largest being M1398269. It
is unknown whether there are inﬁnitely many
Mersenne primes.
Mersenne primes are named for Marin Mer-
senne, a 17th century monk who made a con-
jecture regarding which primes p ≤ 257 are
such that Mp is a Mersenne prime. He was later
shown to have made errors of both commission
and omission in his conjecture.
metric 
A function d : X×X → R satisfying
(i,) d(x, y) > 0 if x ̸= y; d(x, x) = 0,
(ii.) d(x, y) = d(y, x) and
(iii.) d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≤d(x, z), for all
x, y, z ∈X.
A metric may be interpreted as a distance
function on the set X.

x ∈X deﬁne the ε-ball about x by Bε(x) = {y :
d(x, y) < ε}. Then the ε-balls Bε(x) for all
x ∈X and ε > 0 form a basis for the topology
of X.

Meyer-Vietoris sequence
A long exact se-
quence in homology (or cohomology) that is ob-
tained when a topological space X is the union
of two subspaces X1 and X2 such that the in-
clusion (X1, X1 ∩X2) →(X, X2) (viewed as
a map of pairs) induces an isomorphism in rel-
ative homology. The exact sequence is of the
form
· · · →Hp(X1 ∩X2) →Hp(X1) ⊕Hp(X2) →
Hp(X) →Hp−1(X1 ∩X2) →· · ·
The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is closely related
to the Excision Theorem for singular theory.
microbundle
A pair of maps i : B −→E
and j : E −→B such that ji is the identity
map on B and for each b in B, there are open
neighborhoods U of b and V of ib with iU ⊂V
and jV ⊂U and a homeomorphism h : V −→
U × Rn with the following properties.
(i.) The map hi restricted to U includes U as
U × {0} in U × Rn.
(ii.) The map h followed by projection onto
U is equal to the restriction of j to the set V .
The integer n is called the ﬁber dimension of
the microbundle.
Microbundles were introduced in an attempt
to construct tangent bundles on manifolds with-
out differentiable structures. J. Milnor (Micro-
bundles I. Topology 3 (1964) suppl. 1, 53–80)
uses microbundles to show that there is a topo-
logical manifold M such that no Cartesian prod-
uct M × M′ has a differentiable structure that
agrees with the original topological structure.
minimal element
Given a set A and an or-
dering ≤on A, m ∈A is said to be a minimal
element of A if there does not exist x ∈A with
x < m. Alternatively, m ∈A is a minimal el-
ement of A if, for all x ∈A, if x ≤m, then
m = x.
Note that if A has a least or mini-
mum element, then it is unique, and it is also the

unique minimal element of A. If A has no least
element, then A may have more than one, or no,
minimal elements. See least element.
minimal surface 
A surface in R3 with mean
curvature vanishing at every point. (See mean
curvature.) Equivalently, a minimal surface is
a critical point for the surface area functional.
This deﬁnition generalizes to surfaces in higher
dimensionalspacesormoregeneralRiemannian
manifolds. A subtlety of the term is the fact that
a minimal surface need not minimize area; such
surfaces are called stable minimal surfaces.
minimum element 
A least element of a set
A with an ordering ≤. See least element.
mixed area 
A useful concept in convex ge-
ometry, based on the observation that one can
form a weighted average of convex ﬁgures to
obtain a new convex ﬁgure. If M and M1 are
convex ﬁgures in the plane and 0 ≤s ≤ 1, the
mixed ﬁgure Ms is formed by taking all points
sP + tQ for which P is a point in M, Q is
a point in M1, and t = 1 −s.
If A(Ms) is
the area of the convex ﬁgure Ms, then A(Ms) =
s2A(M)+2stA(M, M1)+t2A(M1), where the
number A(M, M1) is the mixed area of M and
M1.

model 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language, σ be
a sentence of L, and A be a structure for L.
If A satisﬁes σ with some (and hence every)
s : V →A, then A is a model of σ, and σ is
true in A. (Here, V is the set of variables of
L and A is the universe of A.) If  is a set of
sentences of L, then A is a model of  if A is a
model of every sentence in .
The term model is sometimes synonymous
with the term structure. See also structure.
model complete
A theory T of a ﬁrst order
language L such that, for all structures A and B
which are models of T , if A is a substructure of
B, then A is an elementary substructure of B.
As an example, let L be the ﬁrst order lan-
guage with equality, whose only predicate sym-
bol is <, and let R be the structure for L whose

modus ponens
universe is the set R of real numbers and where
< is interpreted in the usual way. Then the
theory of R, the set of all sentences true in R,
is model complete.
modus ponens 
The logical rule of inference
“from A and (A →B), infer B.” Here, A and
B can be any well-formed propositional (sen-
tential) or ﬁrst order formulas. Literally, modus
ponens means “the positing method”, where “to
posit” means “to present as a fact” or “to postu-
late”.
morphism 
A category has objects and mor-
phisms. Though a morphism is a primitive no-
tion in category theory, it can be understood as
an abstraction of the notion of function. The
following categories are standard examples (the
objects are listed ﬁrst, the morphisms second):
topological spaces and continuous functions;
Abelian groups and group homomorphisms;
rings and ring homomorphisms; 
partially
ordered sets and monotone functions; complex
Banach spaces and bounded linear transforma-
tions; sets and injective functions; sets and sur-
jective functions.
motion 
An element of the group of motions.
See group of motions.
multiple 
The integer c is a multiple of the
integer a if there exists an integer b so that ab =
c. That is, c is a multiple of a if a is a divisor of
c. See also divisor.
multiplicative function 
An arithmetic func-
tion f having the property that f (mn) = f (m)·
f (n) whenever m and n are relatively prime.
(See arithmeticfunction.) Manyimportantfunc-
tions, including the Euler phi function and the
Möbius function µ, are multiplicative. The val-
ues of a multiplicative function depend only on
its values at powers of primes: if n = pi1
1 · · · pik
k
and f is multiplicative, then
f (n) = f (pi1
1 ) · · · f (pik

See also completely multiplicative function,
strongly multiplicative function.
mutually relatively prime set of integers
A set of integers such that there is no integer d
greater than 1 which is a divisor of all members
of the set. For instance, the set {2, 3, 4} is mu-
tually relatively prime since the only common
positive divisor of 2, 3, and 4 is 1. Note that
the set is not pairwise relatively prime since the
greatest common divisor of 2 and 4 is 2. See
also pairwise relatively prime numbers.

Let C, D be cat-
egories, and let F, G: C →D be functors.

If n is a number, then
negative n (also referred to as the opposite of n),
is the number −n = (−1) × n (i.e., the product
of −1 and n). Alternatively, −n is the additive
inverse of the integer n (the unique integer k so
that n + k = 0).

in a topological space X is a set U such that U
contains an open subset V of X with x ∈V .

that can be derived without the use of Euclid’s
parallel postulate.
This is also referred to as
“absolute geometry”, a term coined by Janos
Bolyai.

that U = {x ∈B : b ≤x}.
normal bundle 
When a manifold is con-
tained in Rn, the directions perpendicular to the
tangent directions are normal. Forming a vector
space at each point of the manifold, these direc-
tions yield a normal bundle over the manifold.
Example: Let M denote a Möbius band in
R3. The normal bundle of M in R3 can be visu-
alized by looking at the part of the bundle over
the middle circle of M: this part of the bundle
is again a Möbius band. One can see this by
taking a normal direction (perpendicular to the
surface of the Möbius band) at any point and
walking around the band along the middle cir-
cle. The normal vector will be pointing in the
opposite direction. This is not true for the cylin-
der (S1 × R1). See Möbius band.
normal curvature
At a point P on a surface,
the curvature (with proper choice of sign) of the
curve formed by the intersection of the surface
with the plane through the normal vector at P
and a unit vector in the tangent plane.
normalized vector

length one by multiplying the vector by the re-
ciprocal of its length.

ing the following: given any two disjoint closed
subsets C and D of X, there exist disjoint open
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

normal to plane
subsets U and V of X such that U ⊃C and
V ⊃D.
normal to plane 
A vector or line, passing
through a given point in the plane, perpendicular
to all lines in the plane passing through the point.
If the plane in space is given by the equation
a(x −x0) + b(y −y0) + c(z −z0) = 0 ,
then the vector (a, b, c) is normal to the plane
at the point (x0, y0, z0).
normal topological space 
A topological
space X in which one-point sets are closed and,
given any two closed, disjoint subsets A1, A2 of
X, there exist disjoint open subsets U1 and U2
of X such that A1 ⊂U1 and A2 ⊂U2. Exam-
ples of normal spaces include metric spaces and
compact Hausdorff spaces.
normal to surface 
At a point on the surface,
the vector orthogonal to the tangent vector space
at the point.
normal vector 
A vector at a point of a mani-
fold (contained in Rn) that is perpendicular to all
tangent vectors at that point. For example, the
north pole is normal to the surface of the earth.
nowhere dense subset 
A subset A of a topo-
logical space X such that the closure of A con-
tains no nonempty open subsets of X. Any dis-
crete set is nowhere dense in a Hausdorff space.
A more interesting example is the Cantor Set,
which is not discrete and yet is a nowhere dense
subset of the unit interval [0, 1]. See Cantor set.
n-sphere bundle 
A ﬁber bundle whose ﬁber
is the n-dimensional sphere, and whose struc-
ture group is a subgroup of the orthogonal group
O(n + 1). It consists of a base space B, a total
space E, and a projection map π : E −→B.
There is a covering of B by open sets Ui and
homeomorphisms φi : Ui × Sn −→π−1(Ui)
such that π ◦φi(x, q) = x.
This identiﬁes
π−1(x) with the n-sphere. When two sets Ui
and Uj overlap, the two identiﬁcations are re-
lated by orthogonal transformations gij(x) of
Sn. For example, if M is a surface in R3, then
the space of vectors of length one tangent to the
surface form the total space of a 1-sphere bun-
dle.

number of distinct prime divisors function
The arithmetic function, denoted ω, which, for
any positive integer n, returns the number of dis-
tinct prime divisors of n. (See arithmetic func-
tion.) For example, ω(12) = ω(24) = 2 ({2, 3}
is the set of distinct prime divisors in both cases).
It is additive.
number of divisors function 
The arithmetic
function, usually denoted τ or d, which, for any
positive integer n, returns the number of posi-
tive divisors of n, i.e., τ(n) = #{a : 1 ≤a ≤
n and a|n }. (See arithmetic function.) For ex-
ample, τ(12) = 6 ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} is the set
of divisors). It is multiplicative; its value at a
prime power is given by
τ(pi) = i + 1 .
See also sum of kth powers of divisors function.

od for expressing numbers which may be visual
(using writing or hand signs), oral (spoken), or
tactile (e.g., the Braille system). A variety of
number systems have been used throughout his-
tory. The number system used by most cultures
today is a positional base-10 system. See base
of number system.

one-to-one correspondence
O
object 
A category has objects and mor-
phisms. Though the notion of an object is a
primitive in category theory, objects can be un-
derstood as generalizing or abstracting concrete
mathematical entities. The following categories
are standard examples (the objects are listed
ﬁrst, themorphismssecond): topologicalspaces
and continuous functions; Abelian groups and
group homomorphisms; rings and ring homo-
morphisms; partially ordered sets and monotone
functions; complex Banach spaces and bounded
linear transformations; sets and injective func-
tions; sets and surjective functions.
oblique 
Neither perpendicular nor horizon-
tal.
oblique angle 
Any angle that is not 0◦, 90◦,
180◦, or 270◦.
oblique cylinder 
A cylinder that is not a right
cylinder.
oblique triangle 
A triangle that does not con-
tain a right angle.
obstruction class 
A cohomology class or
homotopy class of maps for which being null-
homologous or homotopic to zero is equivalent
to the existence of the extension of some map.
Example: Suppose X is formed from a space
Abyattachingann-cellDn toAalongitsbound-
ary; that is, X is the union of A and Dn with each
point in Sn−1, the boundary of Dn, identiﬁed
with some point in A by a map δ. Let f : A −→
Y be a map; it will extend to a map X −→Y
exactly when the class given by f ◦δ is zero
in the cohomology group H n(X, A; πn−1(Y)).
In particular, a map from a sphere Sn−1 can be
extended to a map from the disk Dn exactly
when its class in H n(Dn, Sn−1; πn−1(Y)) =
H n(Sn; πn−1(Y)) is the zero class.
obstruction cocycle 
A cocycle that repre-
sents an obstruction class in cohomology. See
obstruction class.

less than 180◦.

tuse angle. See obtuse angle.
octagon

 if and only if it does not realize it. That is,
A omits  if and only if there is no n-tuple ¯a
of elements of A such that A |= φ(¯a) for every
φ(¯x) in (¯x).
one 
(1) The smallest positive integer, denoted
1.
(2) The multiplicative identity of the complex
numbers (and therefore of the real numbers, the
rational numbers, and the integers). That is, if z
is a complex number, then 1 · z = z · 1 = z.
one-point compactiﬁcation 
A compact
space Xc obtained from a given topological
space X by adjoining a single point ∞ to X. The
deﬁnition of the topology on Xc requires that X
be a locally compact Hausdorff space. The open
sets in Xc are then deﬁned to be the open sets
of X and any set of the form V ∪{∞} where V
is an open subset of X whose complement in X
is a compact set. Note that X is a subspace of
Xc. The one-point compactiﬁcation of the real
line is homeomorphic to a circle, while the one-
point compactiﬁcation of the plane is homeo-
morphic to a sphere. The latter example is espe-
cially important in complex analysis where the
homeomorphism is called stereographic projec-
tion. See stereographic projection.

onto 
If A and B are arbitrary sets, any func-
tion f : A →B such that for every y ∈B there
exists x ∈A satisfying f (x) = y is an onto

or as a surjection. For example, the function
f : R → R given by f (x) = x3 is onto.
open ball 
In a metric space X, any set of
the form B = {y : d(x, y) < r}, for some
center x ∈X and radius r > 0. In a metric
space, the set of open balls forms a basis for
the metric topology. For example, in R3 with
the usual distance metric, the open balls are just
the interiors of spheres.
open cover 
An open cover of a subspace A
of a topological space X is a collection {Uα}
of open subsets of X such that the union of all
the Uα contains A. Open covers ﬁgure in the
deﬁnition of compactness. See compact.

open formula 
A well-formed formula α of a
ﬁrst order language L such that α is quantiﬁer-
free; i.e., α does not have any quantiﬁers.
open map

the image f (U)  of any open set U of X is an
open set in Y. If f is invertible, then f is an open
map if and only if f −1 : Y →X is continuous.

distance metric. See open ball. That is, B is an
open n-ball with center
x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn
and radius r > 0 if
B = {y ∈ Rn : d(x, y) < r} ,
where
d(x, y) =

(x1 −y1)2 + (x2 −y2)2 + · · · + (xn −yn)2 .
open set 
A subset U of a topological space
X which belongs to the topology on X.
open simplex 
The interior Int(σ) of a sim-
plex σ. Speciﬁcally, Int(σ) = σ\ Bd(σ), where
Bd(σ), the boundary of σ, is the union of all
proper faces of σ. For example, an open 1-
simplex is an open interval, while an open 2-
simplex is the interior of a triangle. See simplex.
open star 
If S is a simplicial complex and
v is a vertex of S, the open star of the vertex v
is deﬁned to be the union of the interiors of all
simplices σ of S that have v as a vertex. See
simplicial complex.

gon (having an even number of sides) having an
equal number of sides between them, regardless
of the direction around which one counts.
ordered n-tuple
A list of n arbitrary objects
with a speciﬁed order, viewed as a single object.
The ﬁrst component of the n-tuple is the object
listed ﬁrst, the nth component is the object listed
last, etc. For example, (10, 10, π,
√
2, b) is an
ordered 5-tuple; the third component is π.

ordertopology
ThetopologyonasetX, with

all intervals of the form (a, b) for any a, b ∈
X. If X has either a minimal element m or a
maximal element M, then the sets [m, b) and
(a, M] are included as well. On the real line, the
order topology is the standard topology; that is,
the topology with a basis consisting of the open
intervals.
ordertype(ofawell-orderedset)
Theunique
ordinal number that is order-isomorphic to the
given well-ordered set. Thus, the set {−2, 1, 5},
which is well ordered by the relation −2 < 1 <
5, has order type 3. The set N ∪{#}, which is
well ordered by the relation 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 <
· · · < #, has order type ω + 1.
ordinal (or ordinal number)

well ordered by ∈.

which forms a constant angle with the elements
of the cylinder.
ordinate

Cartesian xy-plane is the ordinate of that point.
For example, the ordinate of the point (2, −3)
is −3.
orientable ﬁber bundle
A ﬁber bundle
F −→E −→B, with F a connected compact
n-manifold, such that it is possible to choose
elements in the homology Hn(Fb) of the ﬁber
above each point b in B so that around each
point there is a neighborhood U and a genera-
tor of the homology Hn(E|U) of E restricted to
U so that the inclusion of the ﬁber into E|U in-
duces a map that takes the (chosen) generator of
Hn(Fb) to the (chosen) generator of Hn(E|U).
Examples: Any trivial bundle over an ori-
entable manifold is again orientable. But the
Möbius band, as a bundle over S1, is not ori-
entable.
orientation
A speciﬁc choice of direction for
a vector space, simplex, or cell. The deﬁnitions
of orientation for these objects extend to give the
important notions of an orientation on a mani-
fold, simplicial complex, or cell complex.
(1) For an n-dimensional vector space V ,
an orientation is determined by the choice of
an ordered basis {v1, . . . , vn}. A second basis
{w1, . . . , wn} gives the same orientation pre-
cisely when the determinant of the change of ba-
sis matrix from {v1, . . . , vn} to {w1, . . . , wn} is
positive.
For example, the ordered basis
{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} gives the orienta-
tion of R3 known as the right-handed orienta-
tion.
(2) An orientation of a simplex is a speciﬁc
ordering of its vertices; two orderings are equiv-
alent if one is an even permutation of the other.
(3) An orientation of a cell en (homeomor-
phic to an n-dimensional ball) is a choice of gen-
erator for the inﬁnite cyclic relative homology
group Hn(en, Bd(en)).
(4) Given a manifold M, each point is con-
tained in an open set that is homeomorphic to
Rn.
Thus, using the deﬁnition of orientation
for vector spaces above, M can be covered by
open sets such that each open set has an orien-
tation. If two such open sets U and V are not
disjoint, we may ask if the orientation on U ∩V
inherited from U is the same or opposite to that
inherited from V . If the orientation on U ∩V is
the same either way, we say U and V are coher-
ently oriented. An orientation on a manifold M
is deﬁned to be a choice of coherently oriented
open sets that cover M.
(5) Similarly, in a simplicial or cell complex,
each point is contained in a simplex or cell which
can be given an orientation. An orientation of
the complex is a coherent choice of orientation
for each cell or simplex.

orientation preserving mapping
Note that if a manifold or complex can be
given one orientation, then it can also be given
the reverse orientation. Many manifolds and

an open Möbius band cannot be oriented. See
Möbius band.
orientation preserving mapping

Any map
between oriented bundles or oriented manifolds
which maps the orientation of the domain to the
negative orientation of the codomain. Example:

plex with an orientation. See orientation.

ordered set is sometimes called a poset.
partial ordering 
A binary relation on a set
A (i.e., a subset of A × A), often denoted by ≤,
which is reﬂexive (for all x ∈A, x ≤x), anti-
symmetric (for all x, y ∈A, if x ≤y and y ≤x,
then x = y), and transitive (for all x, y, z ∈A,
if x ≤y and y ≤z, then x ≤z). Given a partial
ordering ≤ on A and x, y ∈A, x < y is deﬁned
to mean x ≤y and x ̸= y. Note that if ≤ is a
partial ordering on A, then it is not necessarily
the case that every two distinct elements of A
are comparable; i.e., there may exist x, y ∈A
with x ̸= y and x ̸≤y and y ̸≤x.
Sometimes one sees an alternative deﬁnition
of partial ordering, where < is deﬁned ﬁrst and
≤ is deﬁned in terms of <.
A partial ordering on a set A is a binary re-
lation on A, often denoted by <, which is an-
tireﬂexive (for all x ∈A, x ̸< x) and transitive.
Given a partial ordering < on A and x, y ∈A,
x ≤y is deﬁned to mean x < y or x = y. Us-
ing this deﬁnition of partial ordering, one can
prove that ≤ is antisymmetric. Note that if < is
a partial ordering on A, then it is not necessarily
the case that every pair of distinct elements are
comparable; i.e., there may exist x, y ∈A with
x ̸= y and x ̸< y and y ̸< x.
Regardless of the choice of deﬁning < from
≤or ≤from <, the respective notions of ≤and
< are the same.
One example of a partial ordering is the usual
ordering ≤on the natural numbers N. This par-
tial ordering is in fact a total, or linear ordering.
See linear ordering. Let P(N) be the power set
of the set of natural numbers; that is, the set of

all subsets of N. Then set containment ⊆ is a
partial ordering on P(N) which is not a linear or-
dering, as {1, 2} and {3} are not ⊆-comparable;
i.e., {1, 2} ̸⊆{3} and {3} ̸⊆{1, 2}.
partialrecursivefunction 
Allfunctionsmen-
tioned are functions on the natural numbers N;
an n-ary function is partial if its domain is some
subset of Nn (i.e., the function may not be de-
ﬁned on all inputs). The notion of a partial
recursive function is a formalization (Kleene,
1936) of the notion of an intuitively computable
partial function. An n-ary partial function ϕ
is partial recursive if it can be derived from a
certain set of initial functions by ﬁnitely many
applications of composition, recursion, or the
µ-operator; i.e., there is a ﬁnite sequence
ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . , ϕk = ϕ
of functions such that for all i, 0 ≤i ≤k,
(i.) ϕi is an initial function or
(ii.) ϕi can be obtained from {ϕj : 0 ≤j <
i} by composition, recursion, or the µ-operator.
The following functions are initial functions.
• S(x) = x + 1 (the successor function)
• Cn
i (x1, . . . , xn) = i, for all natural num-
bers i, n ≥ 0 (the constant functions)
• P n
i (x1, . . . , xn) = xi, for all natural num-
bers n ≥ 1 and 1 ≤i ≤n (the projection
functions).
Let g1, . . . , gk, f  be n–ary functions and let
h be a k-ary function; let x denote an n–tuple
x1, . . . , xn. The function f is obtained from
g1, . . . , gk and h by composition if for all nat-
ural numbers x1, . . . , xn, f (x) = h(g1(x), . . . ,
gk(x)).
Let f be an n-ary function, n ≥ 1, g be an
(n−1)-aryfunction, hbean(n+1)-aryfunction,
andy denotethe(n−1)-tupley1, . . . , yn−1. The
function f is obtained from g and h by recursion
if for all natural numbers x, y1, . . . , yn−1,
f (0, y)
=
g(y)
f (x + 1, y)
=
h(x, f (x, y), y).
Let f be an n-ary function and let g be an
(n + 1)-ary (possibly partial) function. Let x
denote an n-tuple x1, . . . , xn, and let µ be the
least number operator; i.e., (µx)[· · · ]  denotes
the least natural number x satisfying property
[· · · ]. Let ↓ be an abbreviation of the phrase “is
deﬁned”. If for all natural numbers x1, . . . , xn,
f (x)
=
(µy)[g(x, y)
= 0 ∧(∀z < y)[g(x, z) ↓]] ,
then f is obtained from g by the µ-operator.
If an n-ary function is partial recursive and
total (i.e., the domain of the function is all of
Nn), then the function is called recursive (or total
recursive).
Any primitive recursive function (see primi-
tive recursive function) is recursive; for exam-
ple, the function f (x1, x2) = x1 + x2 is recur-
sive. However, it is not the case that every (to-
tal) recursive function is primitive recursive. An
example of a recursive function that is not prim-
itive recursive is Ackermann’s function, which
is deﬁned informally by “double recursion”, as
follows.
A(0, y)
=
S(y)
A(x + 1, 0)
=
A(x, 1)
A(x + 1, y + 1)
=
A(x, A(x + 1, y)).

partition
(1) Of a set. A pairwise disjoint
collection of nonempty subsets of the given set,
whose union is the given set.
For example,
{{3, a}, {−2}} is a partition of the set {3, a, −2}.
Also, {[n, n + 1) : n ∈Z} is a partition of R
(where each interval [n, n + 1) is the set of real
numbers x such that n ≤x < n + 1). See
quotient set.
(2) Of a positive integer.
If n is a pos-
itive integer, a partition of n is a sequence
(k1, k2, . . . , kr) of positive integers such that

k1 ≥k2 ≥· · · ≥kr and k1 + k2 + · · · + kr = n.
For example, (4, 3) and (2, 2, 2, 1) are two par-
titions of 7.

French mathematician/philosopher Blaise Pas-
cal, the ﬁrst few rows of which are given below:

call the ﬁrst entry (on the left) of each row the
“0th” entry (so the 6 in the middle of the 4th row
is the 2nd entry of that row), then the kth entry
of the nth row is the binomial coefﬁcient

.
Although this array is known as Pascal’s tri-
angle, it has been found in Chinese manuscripts
that were printed 500 years before Pascal’s birth.
path
A path from a point x to a point y in a
topological space X is any continuous function
f : [0, 1] →X with f (0) = x and f (1) = y.
Intuitively, the path is the image of the function
f .
Peano space
A compact, connected locally
connected metric space. By the famous Hahn-
MazurkiewiczTheorem, Peanosetsareprecisely
those sets that occur as continuous images of the
unit interval.
Peano’s Postulates
A set of axioms for de-
veloping the properties (using naive set theory)
of the natural numbers. The axioms were pub-
lished by Peano in 1889 and were based on work
by Dedekind.
There are ﬁve Peano Postulates.
(i.) 0 is a natural number.
(ii.) For every natural number n, there is a
natural number n′, called the successor of n.
(iii.) For every natural number n, n′ ̸= 0.
(iv.) For any natural numbers m and n, if
m′ = n′, then m = n.
(v.) If I is any subset of the natural numbers
such that
(a.) 0 ∈I and
(b.)
for any natural number n, if
n ∈I, then n′ ∈I,
then I contains all natural numbers.
This last postulate is the Principle of Mathe-
matical Induction and is applicable to each of the
uncountably many subsets of the natural num-
bers.
Peano’s Postulates uniquely determine the
set of natural numbers in the sense that if M is a
set that satisﬁes the ﬁve postulates above (with
the phrase “n is a natural number” replaced by
“n ∈M”), then M is the set of natural numbers.
pedal triangle
The triangle within a given
triangle formed by connecting the non-vertex
endpoints of the altitudes of the given triangle.
Pell’s equation
The equation x2 −dy2 = k,
where x and y are unknown variables and d and
k are integers. Pell’s equation is an example of
a Diophantine equation (an equation for which
one searches for integer or rational solutions).
The integer d is usually assumed to be square-
free (that is, if p is a prime divisor of d, then
p2 is not a divisor of d) and positive because
otherwise the equation has only ﬁnitely many
integer solutions for x and y, if any.
pencil of circles
The collection of all circles
in a plane passing through two given points.
pencil of lines
(1) The collection of all lines
in a given plane which pass through a given
point.

A polyhedron with ﬁve faces.
percent 
From the Latin for “per hundred”,
percentages are used as alternatives to fractions
or decimals to represent ratios of numerical val-
ues. For example, 50% (read “ﬁfty percent”)
represents
50
100 or .50. Thus, 35% of 250 is
.35 × 250 = 87.5 (since 35
100 = 87.5
250 ).
perfect number 
A positive integer n having
the property that the sum of its positive divi-
sors is 2n, i.e., σ(n) = 2n. Thus, 6 is a perfect
number since 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 2(6). The next
two perfect numbers are 28 and 496. All even
perfect numbers have been characterized as be-
ing of the form 2p−1(2p −1), where both p and
2p−1 are prime (i.e., where 2p−1 is a Mersenne
prime). There are no known odd perfect num-
bers. See also abundant number, deﬁcient num-
ber, Mersenne prime.
perfect set 
A topological space X with the
property that every point of X is an accumula-
tion point of X. That is, given any x ∈X and
any neighborhood U of x, the set (U ∩X)\{x}
is nonempty. All intervals on the real line are
perfect. An example of a perfect subset of the
real line which is not an interval is furnished by
the Cantor set. See Cantor set.
perfect square 
An integer a for which there
exists another integer b such that a = b2. For
example, 36 = 62 and 289 = 172 are perfect
squares.
perigon 
A 360◦ angle.

especially when considered as the boundary of
a plane ﬁgure.

perpendicular 
(1) The relative position of
a pair of lines that intersect so that they form a
pair of equal adjacent angles.
(2) The relative positon of a line and a plane
such that the line is perpendicular to every line
with which it intersects in the plane.
(3) The relative position of a pair of planes
that intersect so that a line in one is perpendic-
ular to both the line of intersection and to a line
in the other which is perpendicular to the line of
intersection.
perpendicular bisector 
A line or line seg-
ment that bisects a given line segment and is
perpendicular to it. See perpendicular.
pi 
A number, denoted π, equal to the ra-
tio between the circumference and diameter of
any circle. It is also the ratio of the area of a
circle to the square of its radius. It is known
that π is a transcendental (and therefore irra-
tional) number. The value of π is approximately
3.14159265358979 and, although the value of
every digit in the decimal expansion of π is not
known, in 1989 David and Gregory Chudnovsky
calculated π to 1,011,196,691 decimal place ac-
curacy.
point at inﬁnity
A point of the hyperplane
at inﬁnity. See hyperplane at inﬁnity.
polar coordinates
Two numbers (r, θ) that
determine a point P in the (x, y)-plane, r being
the distance from the origin O and 0 ≤θ < 2π
the angle that the ray OP makes with the pos-
itive x-axis, measured in radians and counter-
clockwise, except if P = O, which is associ-
ated to the number zero only; thus x = r cos θ,
y = r sin θ.
If r is allowed to be negative,
the pair (−r, θ) gives the same point as the pair
(r, θ + π).
Polish space
A topological space X that is
separable and completely metrizable. That is, X
has a countable dense subset, and there is a met-
ric d inducing the topology on X for which every
Cauchy sequence converges. Polish spaces are

amples of Polish spaces include R, Rn, C, Cn,
the Cantor space 2N, and the Baire space NN.
Pollard rho method 
A method for factoring
an integer which is known to be composite (us-
ing one of the pseudoprime tests, for example).
The method is based in part on the fact that,
although it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd factors to large
numbers, it is relatively easy (using Euclid’s al-
gorithm) to ﬁnd the greatest common divisor of
two integers.
Let m be a positive composite integer and
deﬁne the sequence {ui} recursively as follows:
(i.) u0 = 1;
(ii.) ui+1 is the unique integer so that ui+1 ≡
u2
i + 1(modm) and 0 ≤ui+1 < m.
(In general, u0 could be any positive integer and
ui+1 = f (ui) for some nonlinear polynomial,
f ). Next, compute Dn = gcd(u2n −un, m) for
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .  If Dn ̸= 1 for any n, then Dn is
a divisor of m.
To illustrate the method, let m = 1771. Then
the ﬁrst few terms of the sequence (starting with
u1)deﬁnedbyu0 = 1andui+1 ≡u2
i +1(modm)
are 2, 5, 26, 677, 1412,. . . Noticethatgcd(u2−
u1, 1771) = gcd(3, 1771) = 1, and gcd(u4 −
u2, 1771) = gcd(672, 1771) = 7, so 7 is a di-
visor of 1771 (as is 1771 ÷ 7 = 253). Since 7
is prime and 253 is composite, we could repeat
Pollard’s method to show that 253 is the prod-
uct of the primes 11 and 23, thus completing the
factorization of 1771.
The Pollard rho method was introduced by
J. M. Pollard in 1975.
polygonal number 
A positive integer n so
that n dots can be arranged in a speciﬁed polyg-
onal pattern. Also called a ﬁgurate number. See
also triangular number, pentagonal number.
polynomial 
A ﬁnite sum of multiples of non-
negative integer powers of an indeterminate x,
with coefﬁcients in a given set R. For example,
3x5 − 4x3 + x2 + 7x − 12 is a polynomial with
coefﬁcients in Z.

positive orthant 
The set of points (x1, x2,
. . . , xn) in Rn such that xi ≥ 0, 1 ≤i ≤n. In
the case of the plane, this is the positive quad-
rant.
postulates of Euclid 
Euclid based his geom-
etry on ﬁve basic assumptions, known as The
Postulates. The ﬁrst four postulates assert that
one can join any two points by a straight line,
extend straight lines continuously, and draw a
circle with any given center and radius, and that
all right angles are equal. The ﬁfth postulate as-
serts the uniqueness of a straight line, through a
point, parallel to a given line.
power set (of a set) 
The set of all subsets of
a given set. The power set of S is denoted by
P(S) or 2S. For example, if S = {3, 5} then
P(S) = {Ø, {3}, {5}, {3, 5}}. The power set of
any set S, together with the operations of union,
intersection, and complementation with respect
to S, forms a Boolean algebra. The unit and
zero element of this Boolean algebra are S and
Ø, respectively. See also Cantor’s Theorem.
predicate calculus 
The syntactical part of
ﬁrst order logic. A predicate calculus is a formal
system consisting of a ﬁrst order language, the
set of all well-formed formulas, a particular set
 of well-formed formulas, which are called
logical axioms, and a list of rules of deduction.
The well-formed formulas that are logical ax-
ioms should be valid formulas. A typical axiom
that might occur in a predicate calculus is
∀x(α →β) →(∀xα →∀xβ),
where α and β are any well-formed formulas,
or, if the language contains equality,
x = y →(α →α′),
where α is an atomic formula, and α′ is obtained
from α by replacing the variable x in α in zero
or more places by the variable y. A typical rule
of deduction in a predicate calculus is modus
ponens. See modus ponens.
A predicate calculus is used to prove theo-
rems. See also proof, theorem. While the actual
choice of logical axioms and rules of deduction
is not important, it is important that a predicate
calculus be both sound (i.e., any well-formed

formula which is provable in the formal system
should be a logical consequence of the logical
axioms) and complete (i.e., any logical conse-
quence of the logical axioms should be provable
in the formal system).
Predicate calculus is sometimes called ﬁrst
order predicate calculus.

primary cohomology operation 
A natural
transformation of functors
H i(X, A; M) −→H i+j(X, A; N) ;
an operation may be deﬁned for many choices
of i and j and many choices of Abelian groups
M and N, or only for speciﬁc choices. Opera-
tions are often additive. The squaring operation,
which takes u to u2, is not additive; the Steenrod
square operations (also called reduced squares)
are additive.
Cohomology operations also exist on gen-
eralized cohomology theories, for example K-
theory and cobordism theories. Adams opera-
tions on K-theory are cohomology operations.
See also secondary cohomology operation.
prime factor 
A prime p that is a divisor of
an integer n. For example, the prime factors of
24 are 2 and 3. See divisor.
prime ideal
Let S be a set. An ideal I on S
is a prime ideal if, for all X ⊆S, either X ∈I
or S\X ∈I.
prime number
(1) An integer with exactly
two positive integer factors (including itself and
1). For example, 5 is prime because its positive
integer factors are 1 and 5, while 6 is not prime
because the positive integer factors of 6 are 1,
2, 3, and 6. Note that the integer 1 is not prime
since it has only one positive integer factor, it-
self.
(2) More generally, an element p of a ring
is prime (or irreducible) if it is not a unit and
all of its factors (in the ring) are associates (unit
multiples) of p.

primitive recursive function
All functions
mentioned are functions on the natural numbers.
An n-ary function f is primitive recursive if it
can be derived from a certain set of initial func-
tions by ﬁnitely many applications of composi-
tion and recursion; i.e., there is a ﬁnite sequence
f0, f1, . . . , fk = f
of functions such that for all i, 0 ≤i ≤k,
(i.) fi is an initial function or
(ii.) fi can be obtained from {fj : 0 ≤j <
i} by composition or recursion.
The following functions are initial functions.
• S(x) = x + 1 (the successor function)
• Cn
i (x1, . . . , xn) = i, for all natural num-
bers i, n ≥0 (the constant functions)
• P n
i (x1, . . . , xn) = xi, for all natural num-
bers n ≥1 and 1 ≤i ≤n (the projection
functions).
Let g1, . . . , gk, f be n-ary functions and let
h be a k-ary function; let x denote an n-tuple
x1, . . . , xn.
The function f is obtained from
g1, . . . , gk and h by composition if for all nat-
ural numbers x1, . . . , xn, f (x) = h(g1(x), . . . ,
gk(x)).
Let f be an n-ary function, n ≥1, g be an
(n−1)-aryfunction, hbean(n+1)-aryfunction,
andy denotethe(n−1)-tupley1, . . . , yn−1. The
function f is obtained from g and h by recursion
if for all natural numbers x, y1, . . . , yn−1,

For example, the function f (x, y) = x + y
is primitive recursive. Informally, the recursion
equations for f are
f (0, y)
=
y
f (x + 1, y)

S(f (x, y)).
More formally,
f (0, y)

f (x + 1, y)

h(x, f (x, y), y),
where h(x, y, z) = S(P 3

principal curvature 
If P is a point in a sur-
face S in R3, then the principal curvatures at P
are the minimum and maximum values of the
curvatures of the curves formed by intersecting
S with a plane through P containing the nor-
mal vector to the surface at P . Equivalently, the
principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the
Weingarten map at P .
principal ﬁber bundle 
A ﬁber bundle whose
ﬁber is a topological group G and whose struc-
ture group is also G, acting on itself by (left)
multiplication. See ﬁber bundle. It consists of
a base space B, a total space E, and a projec-
tion map π : E −→B. There is a covering
of B by open sets Ui and homeomorphisms φi :
Ui×G −→π−1(Ui) such that π◦φi(x, q) = x.
This identiﬁes π−1(x) with G as a topologi-
cal space.
Examples of principal ﬁber bun-
dles are constructed by taking the quotient map
π : L −→(L/G) from a Lie group L to the
quotient space of L by a closed subgroup G. A
universal covering map π : E −→B is a prin-
cipal bundle with the fundamental group of B
(with the discrete topology) as ﬁber and group.
principal ideal
Let S be a nonempty set and
let P(S) be the power set of S. An ideal I on S
is a principal ideal if there exists a set A ⊆S
such that I = {X ∈P(S) : X ⊆A}.
principal type
A type 
(¯x) of a theory T
in a language L such that there is an L-formula
θ(¯x) in 
(¯x) such that T ⊢∀¯x

θ(¯x) →φ(¯x)

for every φ(¯x) ∈
(¯x). That is, under T , the
single formula θ generates the entire set 
.
principal ultraﬁlter
An ultraﬁlter U over a
Boolean algebra B such that there is a b ∈B
such that U = {x ∈B : b ≤x}.
principle of dependent choices
Suppose R
is a binary relation on a nonempty set S, and that,
for every x ∈S, there exists y ∈S such that
(x, y) ∈R. Then there exists a countable se-
quence x0, x1, . . . , xn, . . . (n ∈N) of elements
in S such that (xn, xn+1) ∈R, for all n ∈N.
This principle is also known as the Axiom of
Dependent Choice. It is a consequence of, but
is weaker than, the Axiom of Choice, and it is
the usual replacement of the Axiom of Choice
if the Axiom of Determinacy is assumed.
principle of inclusion-exclusion
A combi-
natorial formula for the cardinality of the union
of a ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite sets. In the case of
two sets, the formula is |A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −
|A ∩B|. For r arbitrary ﬁnite sets A1, . . . , Ar,
the formula is
|A1 ∪· · · ∪Ar| =
r
n=1(−1)n+1  |Ak1 ∩· · · ∩Akn| ,
where the second sum ranges over all n-tuples
of natural numbers (k1, . . . , kn) such that 1 ≤
k1 < · · · < kn ≤r.
product
The general term used for the re-
sult obtained by applying some operation, usu-
ally called multiplication. For example, product
of natural numbers, product of complex num-
bers, product of real-valued functions, Cartesian
product of sets, product of matrices, product of
cardinal numbers, product of ordinal numbers,
product of elements of a group, product of ob-
jects in a category.
product bundle
Formed by taking the tensor
product of the ﬁbers (of two vector bundles E
and E′ over B) over each point of B. Thus, the
tensor product of two line bundles is again a line
bundle. Line bundles over a space form a group
with respect to this product; the group identity
is the trivial bundle B × R −→B.
product category
Let C1, . . . , Cn be cate-
gories. The product C1×· · ·×Cn is the category
whose objects are n-tuples (A1, . . . , An), where
each Ai is an object of Ci, and the morphisms

are n-tuples (f1, . . . , fn), with each fi a mor-
phism of Ci; morphism composition is deﬁned
componentwise: (f1, . . . , fn)◦(g1, . . . , gn) =
(f1 ◦g1, . . . , fn ◦gn). The product of an arbi-
trary number of categories is deﬁned similarly.
product metric 
The metric on a ﬁnite prod-
uct of metric spaces, deﬁned by the formula
d((x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn))
= n
i=1
di(xi,yi)
2i
,
where di is a metric on Xi and (x1, . . . , xn),
(y1, . . . , yn) ∈X1×· · ·×Xn. See metric space.
This deﬁnition shows that a ﬁnite product of
metrizable spaces is metrizable.
product of cardinal numbers 
The product
of some cardinal numbers is the cardinal number
that is equinumerous with the Cartesian product
of the given cardinal numbers. If κ and λ are
cardinal numbers, k · λ denotes their cardinal
product. For example, 3 · 2 = 6 and ℵ3 · ℵ17 =
ℵ17.
product of objects 
Suppose C is a category
and {Ai : i ∈I} is a family of objects of C,
where I is some index set. Let pi : A →Ai be
a morphism for each i ∈I. The tuple (A; pi :
i ∈I) is the product of this family if, for ev-
ery object B of C and every set of morphisms
fi : B →Ai, for i ∈I, there is a unique mor-
phism f : B →A such that pi ◦f = fi, for
all i ∈I. The morphisms pi are usually called
projection morphisms.
product space 
The Cartesian product of
an arbitrary collection of topological spaces
{Xα}α∈A, with the product topology. See prod-
uct topology.
product topology 
The standard topology for
the product 
α Xα of topological spaces. A ba-
sis is given by sets of the form 
α Uα where Uα
is an open subset of Xα and Uα = Xα for all
but ﬁnitely many indices α. The product topol-
ogy is the coarsest topology on the product space

sian product 

projective geometry
An axiomatic system
that grew out of perspective drawing during the
Renaissance; one characterization axiom says
that any two lines in the projective plane have
exactly one point in common. Analytically, the
projective space Pn of dimension n can be given
projective coordinates (x0 : . . . : xn) which de-
termine a point up to rescaling (λx0 : . . . : λxn)
by a non-zero number λ, and satisfy the condi-
tion that at least one xi is non-zero. Thus, the
set of lines containing the origin in R3 gives a
model for the projective plane P2. In it, lines
correspond to planes through the origin and the
point of intersection to the line common to two
planes.
projective set
The projective sets form a hier-
archy extending the Borel hierarchy in any Pol-
ish space X. Let 1
1 denote the collection of all
analytic sets in X. For n ≥1, let
1
n = {A ⊆X : X \ A ∈1
n}
and then let 1
n+1 be the collection of all pro-
jections of 1
n sets in X × NN, where NN is the
Baire space. Let 1
n = 1
n ∩1
n. Then the sets
in
P =
	
n
1
n =
	
n
1
n
are the projective sets. They form a hierarchy
because for each n ≥1,
1
n ∪1
n ⊆1
n+1 = 1
n+1 ∩1
n+1 .
In addition,
1
1 = Borel .
The projective classes 1
n, 1
n, and 1
n are also
known as Lusin point classes.
proof
In ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst or-
der language and consider a particular predicate
calculus for L, with  the set of logical ax-
ioms. Let α be a well-formed formula of L.
A proof of α in the predicate calculus is a se-
quence α1, α2, . . . , αn of well-formed formulas
of L such that αn = α and such that for all i,
1 ≤i ≤n, either
(i.) αi ∈ (i.e., αi is a logical axiom) or
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

propositional logic
(ii.) there exist 1 ≤j1 < · · · < jk < i such
that αi can be deduced from αj1, . . . , αjk using
a rule of inference. (The value of k depends on
the rule of inference; for example, if the rule of
inference is modus ponens, then k = 2.)
The formula α is provable from the predicate
calculus (notation: ⊢α) if there is a proof of α
from the predicate calculus.
If  is a set of well-formed formulas of L,
then a proof of α from  is a sequence α1, α2,
. . . , αn of well-formed formulas of L such that
αn = α and such that for all i, 1 ≤i ≤n, either
(i.) αi ∈ ∪ or
(ii.) there exist 1 ≤j1 < · · · < jk < i such
that αi can be deduced from αj1, . . . , αjk using
a rule of inference.
The formula α is provable from  in the pred-
icate calculus (notation:  ⊢α) if there is a
proof of α from  in the predicate calculus.
The notion of proof in propositional logic is
entirely analogous.
The notion of proof in formal logic is also
called formal proof or deduction.
proper fraction 
A positive rational number
a
b where a and b are positive integers and a < b.
For example, 15
38 is a proper fraction, while 15
8
is an improper fraction.
properlydiscontinuoustransformationgroup
A group G acts properly discontinuously on a
space X if, for each x in X, there is an open
neighborhood U so that whenever g is not the
identity in G, U ∩gU is empty.
Properlydiscontinuoustransformationgroups
are useful for studying covering spaces, which
are given by maps X −→Y such that any point
in Y has a (connected) neighborhood U whose
inverse image is the disjoint union of open sets
of X each homeomorphic to U. A particular in-
stance of this is the covering of a homogeneous
space by a Lie group: an inclusion of Lie groups
H −→G has coset space G/H which inherits
the quotient topology from G; the quotient map
G −→G/H is a covering map.
proper subset (of a set) 
A set S is a proper
subset of a set T if S is a subset of T but S is not
equal to T . Thus, a set is never a proper subset of
itself. For example, {3, 10} is a proper subset of
{3, 10, 47}. The notation is not entirely uniform.
If S is a proper subset of T , many authors denote
this by S ⊂T , whereas others choose to denote
it by S⊂
̸=T or S⊂
̸−T , for example. Compare with
subset.
propositional calculus 
The syntactical part
of propositional logic. A propositional calculus
is a formal system, consisting of an alphabet (see
propositional logic), the set of all well-formed
formulas, a particular set of well-formed formu-
las, which are called axioms, and a list of rules
of deduction.
The well-formed formulas that are axioms
are formulas that are intuitively obvious, and
should be tautologies. A typical axiom that
might occur in a propositional calculus would
be
(α →(β →α)),
where α and β are any well-formed proposi-
tional formulas (this is actually called an axiom
scheme, rather than an axiom, since there are in-
ﬁnitely many axioms of this form, one for each
different choice of α and β). A typical rule of
deduction in a propositional calculus is modus
ponens. See modus ponens.
A propositional calculus, using the axioms
and rules of deduction, is used to prove theo-
rems. See also proof, theorem. While the actual
choice of axioms and rules of deduction is not
important, it is important that a propositional
calculus be both sound (i.e., any well-formed
formula that can be proved from the formal sys-
tem should be a tautology) and complete (i.e.,
any tautology should be provable from the for-
mal system).
Propositional calculus is also called senten-
tial, or statement calculus.
propositional logic
A formal logic with the
following alphabet of symbols:
(i.) (, ) (parentheses)
(ii.) ¬, ∨, ∧, →, ↔(logical connectives)
(iii.) A1, A2, A3, . . . (nonlogical symbols).
Often the list of logical connectives in item
(ii.) is shortened to some complete list of logical
connectives, such as {¬, →}. The symbol An
is called the nth propositional symbol, or nth
sentential or sentence symbol.
The propositional symbols have no mean-
ing, although using truth assignments they can
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

pseudocompact topological space
be interpreted as either true or false. Propo-
sitional logic has rules that tell which expres-
sions from the language are well-formed for-
mulas. The propositional calculus (sentential
calculus) is used to produce theorems of propo-
sitional logic. See propositional calculus, proof.
Truth assignments lead to a semantic notion of
truth in propositional logic, while the proposi-
tionalcalculusgivesasyntacticalnotionofprov-
ability. Propositional logic is also called senten-
tial logic.
pseudocompact topological space
A topo-
logical space X with the property that every
real-valued continuous function deﬁned on X
is bounded. Pseudocompact spaces play a sig-
niﬁcant role in the theory of C∗-algebras.
pseudomanifold
A simplicial complex S
which is a union of n-simplices (for some n)
and satisﬁes
(i.) each n −1-simplex of S is the face of
exactly two n-simplices, and
(ii.) given two n-simplices σ and σ ′ there
exists a sequence of n-simplices σ = σ0, σ1,
. . . , σk = σ ′ with σi ∩σi+1 an n −1 simplex
of S.
Psuedomanifolds share a key homological prop-
erty with actual manifolds; namely, Hn(S) = Z
if S is orientable and Hn(S) = 0 otherwise.
pseudoprime
(1) An odd composite integer,
n, with the property that 2n ≡2 (mod n). That
is, n is a pseudoprime if n is a divisor of 2n −2.
The name is derived from the fact that if p is
a prime number, then ap ≡a (mod p) for all
integers a.
(2) A composite integer n so that an ≡a
(mod n) for all integers a is an absolute pseudo-
prime.
Pythagorean ﬁeld
A ﬁeld, F, in which the
sum of the squares of any two elements from the
ﬁeld is the square of an element from the ﬁeld.
That is, F is Pythagorean if, for every a and b in
F, there exists a c in F so that a2+b2 = c2. The
rational numbers are not Pythagorean since 12+
12 = 2 is not the square of a rational number.
However, the real numbers are a Pythagorean
ﬁeld since
√
a2 + b2 is a real number whenever
a and b are real.
Pythagorean triple
A triple of positive inte-
gers (a, b, c) satisfying the equation a2 + b2 =
c2. For example, (6, 8, 10) is a Pythagorean
triple since 62 + 82 = 102.
If (a, b, c) is a
Pythagorean triple and a, b, and c are pairwise
relatively prime, then (a, b, c) is known as a
primitive Pythagorean triple ((3, 4, 5) and
(5, 12, 13) are primitive Pythagorean triples).
It can be shown that either a or b (or both)
must be even if (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple.
In fact, (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple if and
only if there exist positive integers k, m, and n
so that gcd(m, n) = 1, exactly one of m or n
is even, a = (m2 −n2)k, b = 2mnk, and c =
(m2 + n2)k, providing a formula for generating
all Pythagorean triples.

quotient space
Q
quantiﬁer 
Quantiﬁers are used in order to
quantify if elements with a certain property exist
in a particular universe. The quantiﬁers are de-
noted symbolically by ∃ (the existential quanti-
ﬁer) and ∀ (the universal quantiﬁer). The inter-
pretationoftheexistentialquantiﬁer(∃x)[. . . ]is
that there exists an object x (possibly more than
one) in the universe with property [. . . ]. The in-
terpretation of the universal quantiﬁer (∀x)[. . . ]
is that all objects x in the universe have property
[. . . ].
Note that only one quantiﬁer sufﬁces, since
(∀x)[. . . ]islogicallyequivalentto¬(∃x)¬[. . . ].
A typical use of quantiﬁers occurs among the
axioms for group theory. Given a set G with a
binary operation · on G (i.e., a function from
G × G to G),
(∃e)(∀x)[x · e = e · x = x]
is the axiom that states that there is an element
of G that functions as an identity, while
(∀x)(∃x∗)[x · x∗= x∗· x = e]
is the axiom that states that every element of G
has an inverse in G. Here, the quantiﬁers range
over the universe (group) G.
Also note that order of quantiﬁers is essential.
The statement (∀x)(∃y)[. . . ] does not necessar-
ily have the same meaning as (∃y)(∀x)[. . . ]. In
the ﬁrst statement, the y that exists may depend
onthechoiceofx, whileinthesecondstatement,
the y that exists does not depend on x.
quantiﬁer elimination 
Let L be a ﬁrst order
language. A theory T of L admits quantiﬁer
elimination if, for every well-formed formula ϕ
of L, there is a quantiﬁer-free formula ψ of L
such that (ϕ ↔ψ) is a theorem of T (T ⊢(ϕ ↔
ψ)).
quasicomponent 
Given a topological space
X, deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼ on X by
setting x ∼y if there are no open sets U and V
of X with x ∈U, y ∈V , and X = U ∪V. The
quasicomponent of x in X is the equivalence
class of x under this equivalence relation.
quotient category 
If C is a category and ∼
is a congruence relation on C, the quotient cat-
egory of C with respect to ∼ is the category C′
whose objects are the objects of C and whose
morphisms are the equivalence classes of mor-
phisms of C (with respect to ∼); morphism com-
position ◦ in C′ is given by f1 ◦f2 = f1 ◦f2,
where fi is the equivalence class of fi with re-
spect to ∼.
quotient map 
A surjective function p : X →
Y between topological spaces such that a subset
U is open in Y if and only if p−1(U) is open in
X.
If ∼ is an equivalence relation on X, then the
mapq : X →X/ ∼, sendingpointsofX totheir
equivalence classes, is sometimes referred to as
a quotient map. This agrees with the present
deﬁnition for the equivalence relation given by
x ∼y if and only if p(x) = p(y).
quotient object
If A is an object of a cate-
gory C, a quotient object A is an ordered pair
(f, A′), where A′ is an object of C and f is an
epimorphism f : A →A′. For example, in the
category of groups and group homomorphisms,
a quotient object of the additive group Z is the
pair (f, Z2), where f is the group homomor-
phism that sends even integers to 0 and odd in-
tegers to 1. The dual notion of a quotient object
is the notion of a subobject. See subobject.
quotient set
A set that is a partition of some
other set. In practice, a quotient set is obtained
as the collection of equivalence classes of an
equivalence relation on some set. For example,
the set
{{all even integers}, {all odd integers}}
is a quotient set since it is a partition of Z. The
equivalence relation on Z that gives rise to this
quotient set is: a ∼b if and only if a −b is
even.
quotient space
Let X be a topological space
and ∼an equivalence relation on X. Let X∗be
the set of distinct equivalence classes [x] of X.
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

quotient space
Deﬁne p : X →X∗ by p(x) = [x] and give
the set X∗ the quotient topology corresponding
to the surjective map p. See quotient topology.
Then X∗ is called a quotient space of X. Notice
that equivalent points of X are identiﬁed to a
single point in X∗. This construction thus gives a
topological method for factoring out subspaces
of a space X analogous to the quotient group
construction in group theory.
quotient topology 
Given a surjective func-
tion p : X →Y where X is a topological space
and Y is a set, the quotient topology on Y in-
duced by p is the topology that makes p a quo-
tient map. (See quotient map.) That is, a subset
U of Y is deﬁned to be an open set of Y if and
only if p−1(U) is an open subset of the topolog-
ical space X.

See root of a number.
radius of regular polygon 
The radius of the

a regular polygon.
radius of regular polyhedron 
The radius of
the unique sphere passing through all the ver-
tices of a regular polyhedron.
radix 
A synonym for base. See base of num-
ber system. For example, the decimal expansion
of a real number is also known as its base 10 ex-
pansion or its expansion to the radix 10.
range 
(1) Range of a function. The set of
all values attained by a function. The range of
a function f is often denoted by ran(f ). Thus,
if f : A →B is a function, ran(f ) = {y ∈
B : (∃x ∈A) f (x) = y}. For example, if
f : R → R is the function given by f (x) = x2,
the range of f is [0, ∞). Compare with image.
(2) Range of a variable. The set of all values
a given variable can attain.
(3) Range of a binary relation. If R is a bi-
nary relation, the range of R, often denoted by
ran(R), is the set {x : (∃y) (x, y) ∈R}.
rank 
The rank of a set x is the least ordinal
α such that x ∈Vα+1. In particular, for any
ordinal α, rank(α) = α.
The same notion can be deﬁned using ϵ-
recursion:
rank(x) = sup{rank(y) + 1 : y ∈x} ,
assuming sup{∅} = 0.
rational function 
A function that is express-
ible as a quotient of polynomials.
rational number 
A real number that can be
expressed as a quotient of integers. Further-
more, the digits of the decimal expansion of a
real number will consist of a sequence which,
eventually, repeats periodically if and only if the
number is a rational number. The set of all ra-
tional numbers is normally denoted Q or Q.
real analytic ﬁber bundle 
A ﬁber bundle
such that the base space B is a real analytic man-
ifold, the group G is a Lie group, and the coor-
dinate transformations gij : Ui ∩Uj −→G are
real analytic maps. See ﬁber bundle.
realizes
A model A of a theory T realizes a
type  if there is a set of elements in A which
satisﬁes every formula in . More precisely, A
realizes (¯x), where ¯x = {x1, . . . , xn} contains
all free variables occurring in the formulas in ,
if and only if there is an n-tuple ¯a of elements of
A such that A |= φ(¯a) for every φ(¯x) in (¯x).
real number
A number that has an inﬁnite
decimal representation, which may or may not
terminate or repeat. If the decimal representa-
tion repeats or terminates, the real number is a
rational number; otherwise it is irrational.
The set of real numbers (usually denoted R
or R) can be constructed as the completion of
the rational numbers, in the sense that every real
number is the limit of an inﬁnite sequence of
(not necessarily distinct) rational numbers.

recursion
Letf beann-aryfunction(n ≥1),
g be an (n −1)-ary function, h be an (n + 1)-
ary function, and y denote the (n −1)-tuple
y1, . . . , yn−1 (all functions are functions on the
natural numbers). The function f is obtained
from g and h by recursion if, for all natural num-
bers y1, . . . , yn−1,
f (0, y)
=
g(y)
f (x + 1, y)
=
h(x, f (x, y), y).
The function f (x, y) = x + y can be de-
ﬁned by recursion as follows. Let S(x) be the
successor function; i.e., S(x) = x + 1 for all x.
Informally, the recursion equations for f are
f (0, y)
=
y
f (x + 1, y)
=
S(f (x, y)).
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

recursive
More formally, f is obtained from g and h
by recursion as
f (0, y)
=
g(y)
f (x + 1, y)
=
h(x, f (x, y), y),
where g is the identity function g(y) = y for all
y, h(x, y, z) = S(P 3
2 (x, y, z)), and P 3
2 (x, y, z)
= y for all x, y, z.
Similarly, the factorial function p(n) = n!
for all n is obtained by recursion informally as
0!
=
1
(n + 1)!
=
(n + 1) · n!.
recursive 
A function f on the natural num-
bers which is total (i.e., the domain of f is the
set of all natural numbers) and partial recursive.
See partial recursive function. By the Church-
Turing Thesis, the phrase “f is recursive” can
mean f is total and computable in any formal
sense. See Church-Turing Thesis, computable.
A set A of natural numbers is recursive if
its characteristic function is recursive; i.e., the
function
χA(n) =
 1
if
n ∈A
0
if
n ̸∈A
is recursive.
The set A = {n ∈ N : n is prime} is recur-
sive.
recursively enumerable 
A set A of natural
numbers which is the domain of some partial re-
cursive function. Equivalently, A is recursively
enumerable if it is the empty set or it is the range
of some (total) recursive function; i.e., if A is
non-empty, then there is a computable function
f : N → N which “lists” the elements of A. If
A is the domain of the partial recursive function
with Gödel number e, then A is denoted by We,
the eth recursively enumerable set.
For example, the halting set
K = {e : ϕe(e) is deﬁned}
(the set of all numbers e such that the partial
recursive function with Gödel number e on input
e is deﬁned) is recursively enumerable, but not
recursive. The set
{e : (∀x)[ϕe(x) is deﬁned]}
is not recursively enumerable.
The term computably enumerable (c.e.) is
synonymous with recursively enumerable.
reductio ad absurdum 
Literally, “a leading
back to the nonsensical”. In mathematics, re-
ductio ad absurdum means proof by contradic-
tion. In a proof by contradiction, one assumes
the hypotheses of the statement to be proved,
as well as the negation of the statement to be
proved. The proof is complete when a contra-
diction (i.e., a situation where both a statement
A and its negation ¬A are true) is encountered,
and one then concludes the statement which was
to be proved.
reduction of a language 
Let L1 and L2 be
ﬁrst order languages. The language L1 is a re-
duction of L2 if L1 ⊆L2; i.e., if L2 is an ex-
pansion of L1. See expansion of a language.
reduct of a structure 
Let L1 and L2 be ﬁrst
order languages such that L1 is a reduction of
L2. Let A be a structure for L2. The reduct of
A to L1 is the structure obtained from A which
gives only the interpretations of the predicate,
constant, and function symbols in L1 (all inter-
pretations of the additional symbols in L2 are
discarded). See expansion of a structure.
Reeb foliation
A Reeb foliation of the sphere
S3 is a codimension-one foliation in which one
leaf is a torus S1 × S1, dividing the sphere into
two solid tori, and each remaining leaf diffeo-
morphic to the plane R2. Thus, the sphere is
represented as a union of surfaces, only one of
which is compact, such that at each point there
is a local coordinate system in which each plane
{z = constant} is contained in a single surface.
Reeb Stability Theorem
Let M be a smooth
manifold with a codimension-one foliation in
which one of the leaves is diffeomorphic to the
sphere S2. Then all leaves of the foliation must
be spheres or projective planes and the manifold
M must be S2 ×S1 or the connected sum of two
copies of real projective space RP3.
reﬁnement of a cover
Given a cover {Aα}
of a topological space X (that is, X ⊂∪Aα),

relative computability
a second cover {Bβ} is a reﬁnement of {Aα} if
each Bβ is contained in some Aα.
reﬂexive relation
A binary relation R on
some set S such that (x, x) ∈R, for every x ∈S.
For example, ≤on Z, the usual order relation on
the set of integers, is a reﬂexive relation.
regular cardinal
A cardinal κ such that the
coﬁnality of κ is κ. Thus, κ is regular if, for any
increasing sequence of ordinals γα < κ whose
length is less than κ, sup γα is also less than κ.
For example, any successor cardinal is regular
(assuming the axiom of choice), whereas ℵω is
not.
regular covering
A concept arising in the
theory of covering spaces. Assume that B is an
arcwise connected, locally arcwise connected
space. A continuous function π : E −→B
is a covering map if each point in B has an
arcwise connected neighborhood U such that
each component of π−1(U) is open in E and
is mapped homeomorphically onto U by π. If
γ : [0, 1] −→B is a curve, and if π(e) = γ (0),
then there is a unique curve γ ′ : [0, 1] −→E
with γ ′(0) = e and π(γ ′(t)) = γ (t). γ ′ is
called a lift of γ . The covering is regular if
whenever γ is a closed curve in B, then either
every lift of γ to a curve in E is closed or no lift
of γ is closed. For a regular covering, the cov-
ering transformations are in 1-1 correspondence
with π−1(b), for b any point in B.
regularly homotopic immersions
An im-
mersion is a differentiable map f : M −→N,
whose derivative df (m) is nonsingular at every
point p. It is locally an embedding, but it need
not be globally 1-1. Two such immersions, f0
and f1, are regularly homotopic if there is a dif-
ferentiable map H : M × [0, 1] −→N with
H(m, 0) = f0(m) and H(m, 1) = f1(m) for
all m in M, such that if ft is deﬁned by ft(m) =
H(m, t), then ft is an immersion for each t in
[0, 1]. Thus, the immersion f0 can be contin-
uously deformed through immersions to f1 in
such a way that tangent vectors to M vary con-
tinuously through the deformation. This rules
out untying a knot by pulling it tight.
regular neighborhood
A regular neighbor-
hood N of a subcomplex L in a simplicial com-
plex K is a neighborhood of L that is formed
from the simplices of the second derived subdi-
vision of K.
If {σ ′′} is the collection of simplices of the
second derived subdivision of K, then the reg-
ular neighborhood of L, denoted N(L) is the
collection of simplexes
N(L) = {σ ′′ : σ ′′ ∩L ̸= ∅} .
regular polygon
A (convex) polygon whose
sides have equal length, in which case the ver-
tices lie on a circle.
The n vertices of a
regular n-gon can be taken to be the points
(cos 2πi
n , sin 2πi
n ), i = 0, . . . , n.
regular polyhedron
A (convex) polyhedron
all of whose faces are congruent and all of whose
vertices belong to the same number of faces.
There exist only ﬁve types, the Platonic solids:
tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodeca-
hedron, icosahedron (resp. 4,6,8,12,20 faces).
regular topological space
A topological
space X in which one-point sets are closed and,
givenanyclosedsubsetAofX andapointx ∈X
not in A, there exist disjoint open subsets U and
V of X such that A ⊂U and x ∈V.
relation
(1) n-ary relation. A set of n-tuples.
(2) Binary relation. A set of ordered pairs.
(3) Ternary relation. A set of ordered triples.
(4)Binaryrelationonaset. IfS isanarbitrary
set, R is a binary relation on S if R is a subset of
S × S. For example, the relation “m divides n”
is a binary relation on the set of natural numbers,
since it is the set {(m, n) : m divides n} which
is a subset of N × N.
relative complement of a set (with respect to
another set)
The relative complement of a
set S, with respect to a set U, denoted by U\S
or U −S, is the set of elements that are in U but
not in S. For example, the relative complement
of the set of even integers with respect to Z is
the set of odd integers.

natural numbers, ϕ be a (possibly partial) func-

relative computability
tion on N and f be a total function on N. (A
function is partial if its domain is some subset of
N; a function is total if its domain is all of N.) In-
tuitively, the function ϕ is computable relative to
f if there is an algorithm, or effective procedure,
which, given n ∈ N as input, produces ϕ(n) as
output, in ﬁnitely many steps, if n ∈ dom(ϕ),
where the algorithm is allowed to make ﬁnitely
many queries about values f (y1), . . . , f (yk) of
f . Similarly, a set A of natural numbers is com-
putable relative to a set B of natural numbers if
there is some algorithm which, given n ∈ N as
input, outputs “yes” if n ∈A or “no” if n ̸∈A
after ﬁnitely many steps, where the algorithm
is allowed to make ﬁnitely many queries about
membership y1 ∈B?, . . . , yk ∈B? in B.
Toformalizethenotionofrelativecomputabil-
ity withamathematicaldeﬁnition, onerelativizes
one of the formal deﬁnitions of computability
(seecomputable, partialrecursivefunction). For
example, let ϕ be a partial function on N and let
A be a set of natural numbers. The function ϕ is
partial recursive in A (or partial recursive, rel-
ative to A) if it can be derived from the initial
functions, together with χA (the characteristic
function of A), by ﬁnitely many applications of
composition, recursion, or the µ-operator. A
set B of natural numbers is recursive in A if its
characteristic function χB is partial recursive in
A. See partial recursive function. Similarly, the
function ϕ is Turing computable in A (or Turing
reducible to A, or Turing computable, relative
to A) if there is some oracle Turing machine
which computes it, using an oracle for A. A set
B is Turing computable in A if its characteristic
function χB is Turing computable in A.
An oracle Turing machine is a Turing ma-
chine with a bi-inﬁnite, read-only oracle tape,
which is separate from its work tape (where the
input is originally written), on which is written
the characteristic function χA of A; i.e., the tape
looks like
. . . B n0 n1 n2 . . . ,
where for all i ≥ 0, ni = 1 if i ∈A, ni = 0 if
i ̸∈A, and . . . B indicates that all cells to the left
of the value of χA(0) are blank. The operation of
the Turing machine is the same, except that the
transition function is modiﬁed to account for the
character being scanned on the oracle tape. In
other words, if Q is the set of machine states, S is
the work tape alphabet, and O = {B, 0, 1} is the
oracle tape alphabet, then the transition function
δ has domain some subset of Q × S × O and
range contained in Q × S × {R, L}, and where
δ(q, a, b) = (ˆq, ˆa, m) means that if the machine
is in state q, scanning symbol a on its work tape
and b on its oracle tape, then it replaces a by ˆa on
its work tape, moves the read head on both tapes
one cell to the left or right, depending on the
value of m, and goes into state ˆq. Computation
of a partial function is the same as for a non-
oracle Turing machine; at the beginning of the
computation, the read head on the oracle tape is
positioned on the cell giving the value of χA(0).
See computable for a description of a Turing
machine.
By a relativized version of the Church-Turing
Thesis, allformalizationsofrelativecomputabil-
ity capture the intuitive notion of relative com-
putability, and so the phrase ϕ is computable,
relative to A (or ϕ is recursive in A, or ϕ is A-
computable, or ϕ is A-recursive) means that ϕ
is computable relative to A in any such formal-
ization. The notation ϕ ≤T A means that ϕ is
computable, relative to A. The relation ≤T is
called Turing reducibility.
As an example, note that for any set of natu-
ral numbers A, its complement A in N is com-
putable, relative to A. In addition, any recur-
sively enumerable (computably enumerable) set
B is computable relative to the halting set K =
{e : ϕe(e) is deﬁned}, where ϕe denotes the par-
tial recursive function with Gödel number e.
relative homology group
Given a topo-
logical space X and a subspace A, the nth
relative singular homology group Hn(X, A) is
the nth homology group of the chain complex
{Sq(X)/Sq(A)} obtained by taking the group
Sq(X) of chains on X modulo the group Sq(A)
of chains on the subspace A. If X is a simplicial
(or cellular complex) and A is a subcomplex,
the nth simplicial (or cellular) relative homol-
ogy group Hn(X, A) is just the ordinary homol-
ogy of the complex X/A with the subcomplex
A identiﬁed to a point. A long exact sequence
of the form
· · · →Hn(A) →→Hn(X) →Hn(X, A)
→Hn−1(A) →· · ·

Riemann zeta function
relates the relative to the ordinary homology
groups.
relative homotopy group 
Given a topolog-
ical space X and a subspace A, the nth relative
homotopy group πn(X, A) is the set of homo-
topy equivalence classes of maps f from the n-
dimensional ball Bn to X such that f (Sn−1) ⊆
A where Sn−1, the n−1-sphere, is the boundary
of Bn. A homotopy between two such maps f
and g is required to carry Sn−1 into A for all t. If
A ⊆B ⊆X, then there is a long exact sequence
of the form
· · · →πn(X, B) →→πn(X, A) →πn(B, A)
→πn−1(X, B) →· · · .
relatively open set 
A subset U of a topolog-
ical space X such that U is a proper subset of a
subspace A of X and U is an open subset of A.
relative topology 
The topology on a subset A
of a topological space X that is the collection of
all intersections of A with open sets in X. That
is, U ⊆A is open in the relative topology on A
if there is an open set V ⊆X with U = V ∩A.
The relative topology makes any set A ⊆X into
a subspace of X.
repeating decimal 
A decimal representation
. . . a4a3a2a1a0.a−1a−2a−3 . . .
of a real number for which there exist posi-
tive integers P and N, so that for every n ≥
N, a−n = a−n−P , where a−n (resp. a−n−P )
is the digit in the 10−n (resp. 10−n−P ) place
in the decimal expansion of the number. For
example, the decimal expansion of the number
1517
990 is 1.532323 . . . , where the sequence 32 re-
peats forever (this is often written 1517
990 = 1.532,
where the bar over 32 means that this sequence
repeats forever). It can be shown that a real num-
ber has either a repeating or terminating decimal
representation if and only if that number is a ra-
tional number. Note that a terminating decimal
representation could be said to have “repeating
zeros” and therefore be a repeating decimal rep-
resentation as well.
representative of an equivalence class 
Any
element of an equivalence class.
restriction of a function 
If f : A →B is a
function, the restriction of f to a set S (usually
S is a subset of the domain), denoted by f |S, is
{(x, y) : y = f (x) and x ∈S}.
retract 
A subspace A of a topological space
X such that there exists a retraction r : X →
A. (See retraction.) Retracts are important in
algebraic topology because they cause the long
exact homology and cohomology sequences to
split as short exact sequences.
retraction 
Acontinuousfunctionr : X →A
from a topological space X to a subspace A is
a retraction of A if r(a) = a for all a ∈A.
Equivalently, r is a left inverse to the inclusion
A →X.
Riemann Hypothesis 
The conjecture that all
of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta func-
tion have real part 1
2 (i.e., are of the form x + iy
where x = 1
2 ). Bernhard Riemann stated in his
memoirs that it seemed likely to be true and if
proved could likely be used to prove that there
are inﬁnitely many twin prime pairs.
David
Hilbert listed it as one of the most important out-
standing problems facing mathematicians at the
dawn of the 20th century. Although it is known
that there are inﬁnitely many zeros of the zeta
function with real part 1
2, it is still an open prob-
lem as this book is printed at the dawn of the
21st century. See also Riemann zeta function,
generalized Riemann hypothesis.
Riemannian geometry
The study of the ge-
ometric properties of locally Euclidean mani-
folds. A Riemannian manifold is a manifold
whose tangent space at each point p possesses
a positive deﬁnite inner product g(p)(X, Y),
which varies continuously (usually smoothly)
with the point p.
This structure allows one
to deﬁne lengths, angles, and other geometric
quantities. The term Riemannian geometry is
sometimes used to refer speciﬁcally to elliptic
geometry, which is a non-Euclidean geometry
in which the parallel postulate is replaced by the
postulate that straight lines always intersect.

complex numbers s ̸= 1. It can be shown that
ζ(−2n) = 0 for all positive integers n. It is
conjectured that the only other zeros are of the
form s = 1
2 + iy (that is, have real part equal
to 1
2). This conjecture is known as the Riemann
Hypothesis.
right adjoint of a functor
Let C and D be
categories, and let F : C →D, G: D →C be
functors. G is the right adjoint of F (and F
is the left adjoint of G) if there is a bijection θ
between the collection of morphisms from F(A)
to B and the collection of morphisms from A
to G(B) that is natural for objects A of C and
objects B of D. Hence, this bijection θ sends
every morphism f : F(A) →B to a morphism
θ(f ): A →G(B) so that both conditions (i.)
θ(f ◦F(g)) = (θ(f )) ◦g, and (ii.) θ(h ◦f ) =
(G(h)) ◦(θ(f )) are satisﬁed, for every pair of
morphisms g : A′ →A and f : B →B′. For
example, if C is the category of groups and group
homomorphisms, D is the category of sets and
functions, theforgetfulfunctorG: C →D isthe
right adjoint to the free group functor F : D →
C.
rigid motion
An even transformation of (Eu-
clidean) space which preserves lengths and an-
gles. A rigid motion takes any geometric ﬁgure
to one which is congruent to itself. Because a
symmetry of the plane reverses orientation, it is
not considered a rigid motion of the plane, al-
though it is so viewed when the plane is thought
of as a subset of three-dimensional space. The
rigid motions form a group under composition;
it is the component of the identity in the group
of isometries.
root of a number
(1) If n is a positive integer
and a is a complex number, an nth root of a is a
complex number r such that rn = a.
(2) If n is a positive integer and r is a real
number, the nth root of a, denoted
n√a, is the
unique real number r so that rn = a, if such
a number exists. If n is odd,
n√a always exists
(and is positive when a is positive and negative
when a is negative), while if n is even and a
is negative,
n√a does not exist, within the real
numbers.
root of equation
A number that, when sub-
stituted in a given equation, makes the equation
valid. For example, the real numbers
√
2 and
−
√
2 are roots of the equation x2 = 2, since
x = ±
√
2 are solutions to the equation. A root
of a polynomial p(x) is a root of the equation
p(x) = 0.
rotation
A rigid motion of the plane which
ﬁxes exactly one point, or a rigid motion of
three-dimensional space which ﬁxes the points
on exactly one line, which is the axis of rotation.
ruled surface
An algebraic surface, bira-
tional to C ×P1, where C is a smooth projective
curve. For example, a smooth quadric in P3,
which is isomorphic to P1 × P1.
Russell’s Paradox
A paradox of naive (in-
formal) or non-axiomatic set theory. In naive
set theory, it is possible to form the set A = {x :
x ̸∈x}. Note that if A ∈A, then A ̸∈A, and
if A ̸∈A, then A ∈A. This contradiction is
called Russell’s Paradox.
Russell’s Paradox was discovered by Ber-
trand Russell in 1901 and published by him in
1903. The discovery of this and other paradoxes
revealed that set theory could not be used as a
language to formalize mathematics in a naive
fashion, so that an axiomatic approach, giving
rules for which sets could exist, needed to be de-
veloped in order to avoid contradictions. There
are several axiomatizations of set theory, in-
cluding ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory) and
NBG (von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set the-
ory).
Prior to the discovery of Russell’s Paradox, it
was believed that any deﬁnable collection; i.e.,
any collection {x : P(x)} of objects x satisfying
a property P(x), is a set. The difﬁculty with this
(and with Russell’s Paradox) is that some col-
lections are, in some sense, “too big” to be sets.
In ZF set theory, only deﬁnable collections that
are already subsets of existing sets can be sets
(this is the Axiom of Comprehension, or Axiom
of Subsets). In this set theory, the collection
A above cannot be a set, since assuming it is a
set leads to a contradiction. The NBG set the-
ory differentiates between classes and sets. In
this set theory, the collection A above is a class
which is not a set.

s-cobordism
S
satisﬁable 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language,
and let  be a set of well-formed formulas of L.
The set  is satisﬁable if there exists a structure
A for L and a mapping s : V →A such that
for each formula γ ∈, A satisﬁes γ with s.
(Here, V is the set of variables of L and A is the
universe of A.)
satisfy 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language, α be a
well-formed formula of L, A be a structure for
L, V be the set of variables of L, and s : V →
A (i.e., s assigns each variable in the language
to some element of the universe of A). The
function s can be extended to a function s : T →
A from the set T of all terms of L into A, by
induction, as follows.
(i.) If x is a variable of L, then
s(x) = s(x) .
(ii.) If c is a constant symbol of L, then
s(c) = cA ,
where cA is the element of A assigned to c by
A.
(iii.) If t1, . . . , tn are terms of L and f is an
n-ary function symbol of L, then
s(f (t1, . . . , tn)) = f A(s(t1), . . . , s(tn)) ,
where f A is the n-ary function on A assigned
to f by A.
The structure A satisﬁes α with s (notation:
|=A
α[s]) and is deﬁned by induction on the
complexity of α as follows.
(i.) If α = (t1 = t2), where t1 and t2 are
terms of L, then A satisﬁes (t1 = t2) with s if
s(t1) = s(t2).
(ii.) If α = P (t1, . . . , tn), where t1, . . . , tn
are terms of L and P is an n-ary predicate sym-
bol of L, then A satisﬁes P(t1, . . . , tn) with s if
(s(t1), . . . , s(tn)) ∈P A, where P A is the n-ary
relation on A assigned to P by A.
(iii.) If α = (¬β), then A satisﬁes (¬β) with
s if A does not satisfy β with s.
(iv.) If α = (β →γ ), then A satisﬁes (β →
γ ) with s if A satisﬁes (¬β) with s or A satisﬁes
γ with s.
(v.) If α = ∀vβ, then A satisﬁes ∀vβ with s
if for all a ∈A, A satisﬁes β with the following
modiﬁed version sa : V →A of s:
sa(x) =
 s(x) if x ̸= v
a if x = v .
Let a1, . . . , an ∈A and let ϕ be a well-
formed formula with free variables from among
v1, . . . , vn. The notation |=A ϕ[a1, . . . , an]
means that there is an s : V →A with s(vi) =
ai, for 1 ≤i ≤n, and A satisﬁes ϕ with s.
saturated model 
A model A that realizes as
many types as possible. More precisely, if A is
a model in the language L and X is any subset
of A, let LX be the expansion of L which adds
a constant symbol cx for each x ∈X. Then for
a cardinal κ, A is κ-saturated if for any X ⊆
A of size less than κ, every type (x) in the
language LX which is consistent with the theory
of A (using LX) is realized in A. That is, there
is some a ∈A such that A |= φ(a) for every
φ ∈.
A model A is saturated if it is |A|-saturated.
The rationals are a saturated model of the theory
of dense linear orderings without endpoints.
Schauder Fixed-Point Theorem
Let X be a
closed convex subset of a Banach space. Then
any continuous map f : X →X for which the
closure of f (X) is compact must have a ﬁxed
point; that is, there is an x ∈X with f (x) = x.
In particular, any continuous mapping from a
compact convex subset of a Banach space into
itself has a ﬁxed point.
Schröder-Bernstein Theorem 
See Cantor-
Bernstein Theorem.
s-cobordism
A geometric notion of equiv-
alence for piecewise linear manifolds. An h-
cobordism is a manifold W with boundary the
disjoint union of two manifolds M0 and M1, in
which the inclusion maps i0 : M0 −→W and
i1 : M1 −→W are homotopy equivalences.
This can be reﬁned using the notion of simple
homotopy. If (K,L) is a pair of simplicial com-
plexes with K = L ∪B, with B a closed n-cell

s-Cobordism Theorem
and B ∩L is a face of B, then K is said to col-
lapse to L, and L expands to K. This generates
an equivalence relation on polyhedra called sim-
ple homotopy equivalence. An s-cobordism is
an h-cobordism in which the inclusions i0 and
i1 are simple homotopy equivalences.
s-Cobordism Theorem 
Let W be an
s-cobordism, with boundary the disjoint union
of two manifolds M0 and M1. Then, if the di-
mension of W is at least 6, W is actually equiv-
alent (as a polyhedral manifold) to the product
manifold M0 × [0, 1]. This would be false if
the inclusion maps were only homotopy equiv-
alences.
secondary cohomology operation 
An im-
ageofaliftofacohomologyclassuinH i(Y; A),
formed in the following manner. The class u is
represented by a map u : Y −→K(A, i). Let
α be a cohomology operation corresponding to
the map α : K(A, i) −→K(B, j) for which
αu = 0. Let X represent the two-stage Post-
nikov tower given by α, so that
K(B, j − 1) −→X −→K(A, i) −→K(B, j)
is a ﬁbration with maps i, p, and α, respectively.
Let β : X −→K(G, n) represent a class in
H n(X; G). Since αu = 0, there is a map v such
that v composed with the map X −→K(A, i)
is homotopic to u. The cohomology class in
H n(Y; G) given by composing βu is the sec-
ondary cohomology operation given by this pro-
cedure evaluated on u.
This operation is only determined up to a
coset. If everything is done in the stable range,
then the indeterminacy is due only to the choice
of v; any two choices may differ by any el-
ement of H n(Y, G) which is in the image of
i∗(α) : H j−1(Y; B) −→H n(Y; G). One usu-
ally only uses secondary operations in the stable
range (j and n less than 2i − 1) because inde-
terminacy is difﬁcult to determine otherwise.
These are operations that arise from the re-
lations among primary cohomology operations.
The Adem relation Sq3Sq1 +Sq2Sq2 = 0 gen-
erates a secondary cohomology operation that
showsthatη2 isessential(nothomotopictozero),
where η represents the Hopf map S3 −→S2 (in
the Hopf bundle) or any suspension of that map.
Note that a secondary cohomology operation is
not deﬁned on the whole cohomology group in
general. See Adem relations. See also primary
cohomology operation.

A topological space
X which is not ﬁrst category; that is, X is not
equal to the union of a countable collection of

A topo-
logical space that has a countable basis for its
topology. For example, the real line (with its
standard topology) is second countable since
open intervals with rational endpoints form a
basis.

separable topological space
A topological
space with a countable, dense subset. For ex-
ample, the real line (with its standard topology)
is separable, since the set of rational numbers is

Two subsets A and B of a

separation axioms
A system of axioms for
topological spaces X which measure, in increas-
ing fashion, the extent to which points and sub-
sets are separated by the topology on X. The
standard axioms are called the T0, T1, T2, T3,
and T4 axioms. Other axioms, including com-
pletely regular, Tychonoff, and Urysohn spaces,

set 
(1) In naive set theory. A set is any col-
lection of arbitrary objects. When such a col-
lection is seen as a single entity, it is considered
a set. Alternative terms: collection or family (in
particular, these terms are often used for sets of
sets, sets of sets of sets, and so on; so a set of sets
is often called a family of sets, or a collection
of sets). Sets are determined by their elements
(their members). Standard set notation deﬁnes
a set by listing or describing its elements within
curly brackets: {,}. For example, the set whose
only elements are the number 3 and the letter
Q is written in list form as {3, Q} or {Q, 3}
(the order of listing does not matter). The set
{2, 4, 6, 8} (list form) can also be expressed in
description form as {2n : n = 1, 2, 3, 4} or as
{2n | n = 1, 2, 3, 4}.
(2) In axiomatic set theory. A formal mathe-
matical object whose existence is a consequence
of the axiomatic system with which one is work-
ing. For example, in Zermelo-Fraenkel set the-
ory, sets are built using axioms such as Union,
Comprehension, Power Set, etc. See Zermelo-
Fraenkel set theory, Bernays-Gödel set theory.

sets within a formal axiomatic framework. Also
known as the foundation of mathematics, refer-
ring to the notion that all of mathematics can
be carried out within set theory. For example,
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory models mathemat-
ics in a natural way. See also Zermelo-Fraenkel

sexagesimal number system 
A number sys-
tem, usedbytheancientBabyloniancivilization,
that was a base 60 positional system, in con-
trast to the base 10 positional system commonly
used today. The value of a particular number
depends both on the numerals used in its repre-
sentation and the placement of these numerals.
Using the symbols | and < to represent 1 and
10 respectively, one can denote the number 34
as <<< ||||, 154 is expressed as ||
<<< ||||
(2×60+34), and 5000 is represented by | <<
||| << ((1×602)+(23×60)+20). A high base
such as 60 is useful for dealing with large num-
bers, since the “place values” represent powers
of the base (60), namely, 1, 60, 3600, 216000,
. . .  One of the difﬁculties is the fact that there
must be 60 “digits” (representing the values 0
to 59). In fact, the Babylonians did not have a
symbol for zero so the number << ||||||| < |||
could represent 1663 ((27 × 60) + 13) or 97213
(27 × 3600) + (0 × 60) + 13). See also base of
number system.
sheaf
A structure F on a topological space
X, which assigns an object F(U) to each open
subset U of X, and for each inclusion U in V
of open sets in X, F assigns a restriction map
rV,U : F(V ) −→F(U) so that rU,U is the
identity on F(U) and whenever U in V in W are
nested open sets, rV,U ◦rW,V = rW,U. Further,
whenever U = ∪a∈IUa is a covering of U by
open sets Ua, and {fa} is a collection of elements
fa in F(Ua) such that the restrictions of fa and
fb to Ua∩Ub are equal, there is a unique element
f in F(U) such that the restriction rU,Ua(f ) to
each Ua is just fa.
Example: The collection of open sets of a
space X is a sheaf with F(U) = U. One may
also use sheaves as coefﬁcients in homology of
X.
sieve of Eratosthenes
A method (named af-
ter the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes) for
“sifting” out the prime numbers less than a ﬁxed
integer N. It relies on the fact that if n is a pos-
itive integer less than or equal to N, then n is
either a prime number or has a prime factor that
is less than or equal to
√
N.
To ﬁnd the primes less than or equal to N,
ﬁrst list the integers from 2 to N. Then, circle
2 and cross out all of the other multiples of 2
since we know they cannot be primes (they are
divisible by 2). Notice that the smallest integer
left that is not circled or crossed out is 3 (the
next prime number). Circle 3 and cross out the
remaining multiples of 3. Now, circle the small-
est integer that is neither circled nor crossed out
(5) and cross out all its other multiples. Con-
tinue this process until the smallest integer that
is neither circled nor crossed out is greater than

simple closed curve
√
N. Circle the remaining integers in the list;
the integers that have been circled are the primes
less than or equal to N.
simple closed curve 
A topological space C
that is homeomorphic to the unit circle. Intu-
itively, this means that C does not cross itself.
simple homotopy equivalence 
A homotopy
equivalence f : S1 →S2 between two simpli-
cial complexes which is obtained as a composi-
tion of elementary contractions and expansions.
Given an n-simplex σ of a simplicial complex S
such that σ is the face of a unique n+1-simplex
τ, an elementary contraction of S is the map that
collapses σ and τ to a point. An elementary
expansion of S is the inverse of an elementary
contraction.
simplex 
Let {a0, . . . , an} be a geometri-
cally independent subset of Rn. The n-simplex
σ spanned by {a0, . . . , an} is the set of all points
x =
n

k=0
tkak, where
n

k=0
tk = 1 ,
and tk ≥ 0 for all k. The points {a0, . . . , an}
are called the vertices of σ. The tk are called
the barycentric coordinates for σ. Any simplex
spanned by a subset of {a0, . . . , an} is called a
face of σ. For example, a 0-simplex is a point, a
1-simplex is a line segment, and a 2-simplex is
a triangle.
simplicial approximation 
Let f : S1 →
S2 be a continuous function between simplicial
complexes. A simplicial mapping g : S1 →S2
isasimplicialapproximationforf iff (St(v)) ⊆
St(g(v)) for every vertex v of S1 where St(v) de-
notes the star of the vertex v.
simplicial complex 
A set V of vertices, to-
gether with a set K of ﬁnite subsets of V called
simplices, satisfying the condition: if σ is a sim-
plex and τ is a subset of σ, then τ is also a sim-
plex.
simply connected domain 
A subset D of a
topological space X which is open, connected,
and simply connected as a subspace of X. See
simply connected space. That is, D must be
path-connected and have a trivial fundamental
group, π1(D), as a subspace of X.
simply connected space 
A topological space
X which is path-connected and has trivial funda-
mental group π1(X). That is, any closed path in
X is homotopic to a constant path. For example,
a circular disc in the plane is simply connected,
while an annulus is not because there are paths
in it (going around the annulus) which cannot
be continuously deformed to a constant path.
singleton set 
Any set with exactly one ele-
ment. For example, {7} is a singleton.
singular cardinal 
A cardinal number whose
coﬁnality is smaller than itself. Thus, if κ is a
singular cardinal, κ is not regular and cf(κ) <
κ. For example, ℵω is a singular cardinal. Com-
pare with regular cardinal.
singular complex 
For X a topological space,
the chain complex S(X) = {Sn(X)} of free
Abelian groups (or free modules over a ring R),
generated by singular simplices. See chain com-
plex. The standard k-simplex is the set σk =
{(x0, x1, . . . , xk) ∈Rk+1 : x0 + . . . + xk = 1,
each xi ≥0}. A singular k-simplex is a con-
tinuous function φ : σk −→X.
For each
n ≥0, Sn(X) is the free module generated by
the singular k-simplices.
The boundary map
∂k : Sk(X) −→Sk−1(X) is constructed by tak-
ing a singular simplex φ to the alternating sum
of the (k −1) −simplices determined by re-
stricting φ to its faces.
singular homology
A graded Abelian group
H(X) = {Hn(X)}, determined by a space X.
The group Hk(X) is the quotient of the sin-
gular cycles Zk(X) = ker∂k : Sk(X) −→
Sk−1(X) modulo the boundaries Bk(X)
=
∂k+1(Sk+1(X)). The singular homology groups
are fundamental invariants of X.
singular n-boundary
If {Sn(X)} is the sin-
gular complex of a space X, then the nth bound-
ary group Bn(X) is the subgroup of Sn(X) con-
sisting of elements of the form ∂c for c in
Sn+1(X). The elements of Bn(X) are singular
n-boundaries.

pansion of a language L is L ∪{fφ

Skolem function for φ. See Skolem function.

for each Skolem function fφ of L. The language
of the expanded theory is the Skolem expansion
of L.
(3) A Skolem expansion of a structure A in
the language L is a model A′ which adds to A

The language of the expanded model A′ is the

In effect, the symbol fφ( ¯y) names a witness of
the existential statement ∃xφ(x, ¯y) for each ¯y
which has one.
Skolem hull 
If X is a subset of an L-structure
A, the Skolem hull of X is the smallest submodel
of the Skolem expansion of A which contains X.
Equivalently, it is the smallest subset of A con-
tainingX whichisclosedundertheoperationsof

ical manifold M, which induces the given topo-
logical structure. A smoothing of a piecewise
linear manifold is a smooth structure in which
each simplex is smooth.
smoothing problem 
The problem of deter-
mining the existence or non-existence of a
smoothing of a topological or piecewise linear
manifold M. See smoothing. The problem al-
ways has an afﬁrmative solution in dimensions
less than or equal to three, but there are many
counterexamples in higher dimensions, both for
existence and uniqueness of smoothings.

Sorgenfrey line
Sorgenfrey line 
The real line with the topol-
ogy given by taking the collection of all half-
open intervals [a, b) (or (a, b]) as a basis. It is
also known as the lower (or upper) limit topol-
ogy.
The Sorgenfrey line is normal and Lindelöf
but not second countable. Its product with itself
(the Sorgenfrey plane) is neither normal nor Lin-
delöf. Thus, it is an example showing that the
product of normal spaces need not be normal,
and the product of Lindelöf spaces need not be
Lindelöf. See normal space.
Sorgenfrey plane 
See Sorgenfrey line.
space of complex numbers 
The complex
numbers, visualized as a plane with real and
imaginary axes, together with the usual (prod-
uct) topology of the plane, is a topological space.
The set of purely imaginary numbers forms a
subspace homeomorphic to the real line.
The imaginary axis, considered a subspace,
is homeomorphic to the real numbers.
space of imaginary numbers 
See space of
complex numbers.
space of irrational numbers 
A subspace
of the space of real numbers: closeness, as de-
scribed by open sets, is determined by open in-
tervals in the real numbers intersected with the
respective set. The space is dense in the space
of real numbers; that is, its closure is the space
of real numbers.
space of rational numbers 
A subspace, usu-
ally denoted Q or Q, of the space of real num-
bers: closeness, as described by open sets, is de-
termined by open intervals in the real numbers
intersected with the respective set. The space Q
is dense in the space of real numbers; that is, its
closure is the space of real numbers.
space of real numbers 
The set of real num-
bers together with the usual real line topology
generated by open intervals, usually denoted
R, R, R1 or E1. Intuitively, open sets describe
closeness, and typical uses of the real numbers
require a topology where decreasing intervals
around a point describe points strictly closer to
that point. R is also a metric space with dis-
tance function d(x, y) = |x −y|. See also real
number.

F containing a given set C of vectors in F.

n+1 = 1.
(2) More generally, a space homeomorphic

spherical distance
The greatest lower bound
of the lengths of all paths between two points p
and q lying on the (unit) sphere. It is the length
of the short great circle arc joining p to q.
spherical polygon
A closed curve on the sur-
face of the sphere made up of a ﬁnite number of
great circle arcs.
spherical triangle
A closed curve consisting
of three points A, B, and C on the sphere, to-
gether with a great circle arc joining each pair
of points. Sometimes the arcs are required to be
shortest arcs.
square-free integer
An integer that is not di-
visible by any perfect square other than 1. The
prime factorization of a square-free integer con-
tains no exponent greater than 1. Thus, 21 is
square-free, but 20 is not, since 22 is a divisor
of 20.
square number
An integer that equals n2 for
some integer n.
square root
(1) (Of a non-negative real num-
ber r) The unique non-negative real number s so
that s2 = r, denoted √r.
(2) If z and w are complex numbers such that
w2 = z, then w is said to be a square root of z
(therewillbetwosquarerootsofagivennonzero
complex number, since if w is a square root of
z, so is −w and by the Fundamental Theorem
of Algebra, the equation x2 = z has at most two
distinct solutions).
stable(primary)cohomologyoperation
Let
X denote the suspension of a space X (S1∧X).
Then H q(X) is isomorphic to H q+1(X) by

Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation
an isomorphism called the suspension isomor-
phism (here denoted ), natural in X.
A cohomology operation P is stable when
P = P , that is, P commutes with the sus-
pension isomorphism. The Steenrod square and
power operations are examples of stable (pri-
mary) cohomology operations. See Steenrod
square operation.
stable range 
Some algebraic invariants be-
have well with respect to suspension, sometimes
with connectivity restrictions. For example, if
X is (n − 1)-connected and i ≤ 2n − 2, then
πi(X) is isomorphic to πi+1(X). This range
is called the stable range of X.
In homotopy theory, one may be concerned
with the stable range in calculating homotopy
groups or the effect of cohomology operations.
stablesecondarycohomologyoperation 
See
stable (primary) cohomology operation.
stably parallelizable manifold 
A smooth
manifold M such that the Whitney sum of the
tangent bundle of M and a trivial bundle over M
is a trivial bundle. For example, the tangent bun-
dle of the sphere S2 is not trivial, but its Whitney
sum with a 1-dimensional trivial bundle is triv-
ial. Thus, S2 is stably parallelizable.
stationary set 
A set of ordinals S ⊆κ which
meets every closed unbounded set in κ; i.e., S ∩
C ̸= ∅for each closed and unbounded C ⊆κ.
Stationarysets aresomewhatlarge; forexample,
they are unbounded because for each α < κ,
Cα = [α, κ) is closed and unbounded.
Steenrod algebra 
The algebra of all coho-
mology operations for ordinary mod p coho-
mology, for a prime p. When p = 2, the Steen-
rod square operations Sqi generate the Steenrod
algebra. For odd primes p, the analog of the
squares are the pth power operations P i; these
together with the Bockstein operation generate
the Steenrod algebra for p odd.
The Steenrod squares are deﬁned as additive
cohomology operations
Sqi : H q(X, A) −→H q+i(X, A)
(additive natural transformations
Sqi : H q(−) −→H q+i(−))
for which
(i.) Sq0 is the identity;
(ii.) for u in H i(X, A), Sqiu = u ∪u = u2;
(iii.) for u in H i(X, A) and i > k, Sqku = 0;
(iv.) for u in H a(X, A) and v in H b(Y, B),
the effect on uv in H ∗(X × Y, A × B) is given
by the Cartan formula:
Sqk(u × v) =

i+j=k
Sqiu × Sqjv .
Thepoweroperationsaredeﬁnedbysimilarprop-
erties. See also Bockstein operation.
The cohomology of a space is a comodule
over the Steenrod algebra. This structure (coac-
tion) is preserved by many (not all) construc-
tions and calculational techniques, and hence
can be used to calculate the cohomology of cer-
tain spaces, for example, Eilenberg MacLane
spaces (whose cohomology can be calculated
using the Serre spectral sequence).

stereographic projection 
An identiﬁcation
of the plane with the sphere minus a point, N,
say, obtained by projecting from N a point P
on the sphere different from N. If the sphere
of radius 1 touches the (x, y) coordinate plane
at the origin and N = (0, 0, 2), the projection
sends (x, y, z) to ( 2x
2−z, 2y
2−z).
Sometimes, instead, the entire sphere is iden-
tiﬁed with the complex plane, together with the
point at inﬁnity. See also complex sphere.
Stirling number
The number Sm
n for n ≥m,
which denotes the number of partitions of a set
of n objects into m non-empty subsets. These
numbers are given by the recurrence relations
S1
n = 1 = Sn
n and Sk
n+1 = Sk−1

+ kSk
n for
1 < k < n.
Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation
The unique
largest compactiﬁcation β(X) of a completely
regular topological space, X. Its usefulness de-
rives from the fact that any continuous function
from X to a compact Hausdorff space may be
extended uniquely and continuously to β(X).
© 2001 by CRC Press LLC

strong induction
To construct β(X), let F be the set of all
continuous functions from X to the closed unit
interval, [0, 1]. Then the product space [0, 1]F ,
of one copy of the unit interval for each f ∈F,
is a compact Hausdorff space by Tychonoff’s
Theorem. Imbed X in [0, 1]F by mapping x ∈
X to the element of the product with f (x) in its
f -coordinate. β(X) is the closure of the image
of X under this imbedding. See also one-point
compactiﬁcation.
strong induction 
A method of proof over
well-ordered sets. In practice, strong induction
is typically used over the set of natural numbers.
Strong induction has a base-case, like induction,
but a different inductive step. Expressed in for-
mal notation, the base-case is P(n0), for some
n0; the inductive step has the form:
(∀k)[[(∀n ≤k)P(n)] →P(k + 1)] .
From these the conclusion is (∀k ≥n0)P(k),
where P (k) is some statement and n0, n, k  are
natural numbers. Strong induction is equivalent
to induction. See induction.
strongly multiplicative function 
A multi-
plicative function f having the property that
f (pi) = f (p) for all primes p and all positive
integers i. For example, the function f (n) =
φ(n)
n , whereφ istheEulerphifunction, isstrongly
multiplicative. See multiplicative function, Eu-
ler phi function. See also completely multiplica-
tive function.
strong pseudoprime 
See pseudoprime.
structure 
A mapping A, which assigns val-
ues to the quantiﬁer symbol, the predicate sym-
bols, theconstantsymbols, andthefunctionsym-
bols of a ﬁrst order language L, as follows.
(i.) A assigns to the quantiﬁer symbol ∀ a
nonempty set A (sometimes denoted by |A|),
called the universe of A.
(ii.) For each n-ary predicate symbol P , A
assigns P to an n-ary relation P A ⊆An.
(iii.) For each constant symbol c, A assigns
c to an element cA of A.
(iv.) For each n-ary function symbol f , A
assigns f to an n-ary function f A : An →A.
For example, if L is the language of elemen-
tary number theory (see ﬁrst order language),
then one possible structure for L is the intended
structure N, which assigns the quantiﬁer ∀to N,
the set of natural numbers, and <, 0, S, +, ·, E
to their intended interpretations on N. There
are other (non-standard) structures for this lan-
guage.
A structure is sometimes called a model.
subbasis for a topology
A collection of sub-
sets of a topological space X whose set of ﬁnite
intersections forms a basis for the topology τ of
X. For example, the set of all open intervals of
the form (−∞, a) or (a, ∞) is a subbasis for the
usual topology on R because each basic open set
(a, b) can be written as (−∞, b) ∩(a, ∞).
Any collection S of subsets of a nonempty
set X generates a topology on X by declaring S
to be a subbasis. That is, the topology is the set
of all unions of ﬁnite intersections of elements
from S. The topology generated in this way is
the smallest topology on X which contains S.
subbundle
A bundle F ′ −→E′ −→B
contained a given bundle F −→E −→B.
The tangent bundle and normal bundle of a
manifold M embedded in Rn are both subbun-
dles of the trivial bundle M × Rn.
subcategory
C′ is a subcategory of a cate-
gory C if (i.) every object of C′ is an object of
C, (ii.) for every pair of objects A, B of C′, if
f : A →B is a morphism of C′, then f is a
morphism of C, and (iii.) for every pair f, g of
morphisms of C′, the compositions f ◦c′g and
f ◦cg are the same morphisms in C and C′. C′ is
a full subcategory of C if, in addition, for every
pair A, B of objects of C′, f : A →B is a mor-
phism of C′ if and only if f is a morphism of
C. For example, the category of sets and bijec-
tive functions is a subcategory of the category
of sets and injective functions; the category of
Abelian groups and group homomorphisms is a
full subcategory of the category of groups and
group homomorphisms.
subobject
If A is an object of a category C, a
subobject of A is an ordered pair (f, A′), where
A′ is an object of C and f is a monomorphism
f : A′ →A. For example, in the category of
groups and group homomorphisms, a subobject
of the additive group Z is (f, E), where E is

the additive group of even integers and f is the
inclusion map f : E → Z. The dual notion of
subobject is the notion of quotient object. See
quotient object.
subset(ofaset) 
AsetS isasubset ofasetX if
all elements of S are also elements of X. If S is a
subset of X, the notation is S ⊆X, or sometimes
S ⊂X. For example, {4, −2} ⊆{−2, 5, 4}.
Every set is a subset of itself. Compare with
proper subset.

Any subset of a topological space
X, with the relative topology inherited from X.

taining all its open subintervals, the subspace
topology on the unit interval [0, 1] also includes
the half-open intervals [0, b)  with b ≤ 1 and
(a, 1] with a ≥ 0.
substructure 
The structure A for the ﬁrst or-
der language L is a substructure of the structure
B for L (notation: A ⊆B) if
(i.) A ⊆B, where A and B are the universes
of A and B, respectively,
(ii.) for each n-ary predicate symbol P , the
n-ary relation P A is the restriction of P B to An;
i.e., P A = P B ∩An,
(iii.) for each constant symbol c, cA = cB,
and
(iv.) for each n-ary function symbol f , f A
is the restriction of f B to An.
If A is a substructure of B, then B is called
an extension of A.

successorcardinal 
Acardinalnumberκ such
that there exists some other cardinal λ such that
λ+ = κ. For example, ℵ17 is a successor car-
dinal since ℵ+
16 = ℵ17; ℵ17 is a limit ordinal.
Compare with limit cardinal, successor ordinal.
successor of a cardinal 
If κ is a cardinal, the
cardinal successor of κ, denoted by κ+, is the
leastcardinalthatisgreaterthanκ. Forexample,
3+ = 4 and ℵ+
0 = ℵ1. Compare with successor
of an ordinal.
successor of an ordinal 
If α is an ordinal,
the ordinal successor of α, denoted by α + 1,
is α ∪{α}; it is the least ordinal that is greater
than α. For example, 3 + 1 = 4 and the ordinal
successor of ω is ω+1. Compare with successor
of a cardinal.
successor of a set 
If S is any set, its successor
is S ∪{S}.
successor ordinal 
An ordinal number α such
that there exists some other ordinal β such that
β + 1 = α. For example, ω3 + 5 is a successor
ordinal since (ω3 + 4) + 1 = ω3 + 5. The car-
dinal number ℵ1 is a successor cardinal but not
a successor ordinal. Compare with successor
cardinal, limit ordinal.
sum of cardinal numbers 
The cardinal num-
ber that is equinumerous with the disjoint union
of the summands. For example, 1 + 1 = 2, and
ℵ0 + ℵ3 = ℵ3.
sumofdivisorsfunction 
Thearithmeticfunc-
tion, denoted σ, which, for any positive integer
n, returns the sum of the positive divisors of n,
i.e., σ(n) = 
d|n d. (See arithmetic function.)
For example, σ(10) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18.
It is multiplicative; its value at a prime power is
given by
σ(pi) = pi+1 − 1
p − 1
.
Seealsomultiplicativefunction, sumofkthpow-
ers of divisors function.
sum of kth powers of divisors function
The family of arithmetic functions, denoted σk,
which, for any positive integer n and a ﬁxed
nonnegative integer k, returns the sum of the
kth powers of the positive divisors of n, i.e.,
σk(n) = 
d|n dk. (See arithmetic function.)
For example,
σ2(8) = 12 + 22 + 42 + 82 = 85 .
The function σ0 is the number of divisors func-
tion τ, and σ1 is the sum of divisors function
σ. The functions σk are all multiplicative; their
value at a prime power is given by
σk(pi) = pk(i+1) −1

Suslin line 
A dense linear ordering (L, <)
which in the order topology has the countable
chain condition but is not separable. That is, L
hasnocountabledensesubset, butanycollection
of pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets in L is
countable.
It is possible to characterize the real line R
as the unique dense linear order without end-
points which is complete and separable. The
question arose as to whether separability could
be replaced by the countable chain condition,
and so the existence of a Suslin line would mean
that this new set of conditions does not charac-
terize R. However, the existence of a Suslin line
is independent of the axioms of set theory, and
thus, so is the characterization. See also Suslin
tree.
Suslin’s hypothesis 
The assertion that there
is no Suslin line. See Suslin line. That is, there
is no dense linear ordering which in the order
topology has the countable chain condition but
is not separable. Souslin’s hypothesis (abbre-
viated SH) is independent of the axioms of set
theory: it is a consequence of Martin’s Axiom,
but¬SHisaconsequenceofDiamond(♦), which
holds in the constructible universe. These re-
sults are usually obtained indirectly, by consid-
ering Suslin trees rather than Suslin lines. See
also Martin’s Axiom.
Suslin tree 
A tree of height ω1, which has
no uncountable antichains or branches. That is,
any subset A ⊆T consisting of incomparable
elements (antichain) or any set B ⊆T totally
ordered by < (branch) must be countable. The
existence of Suslin trees is independent of the
axioms of set theory. In fact, Suslin trees pro-
vide a way to prove the independence of Suslin’s
hypothesis (SH) because a Suslin tree exists if
and only if a Suslin line exists. See Suslin line.
For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, a κ-Suslin tree is
a tree of height κ in which all antichains and
branches have size less than κ.
See also Aronszajn tree, Kurepa tree.
symmetric difference
The symmetric differ-
ence of two sets A and B, written A△B, is the
set (A \ B) ∪(B \ A). That is, it is the set of
all elements that belong to either A or B but not
both.
symmetric relation
A binary relation R such
that (x, y) ∈R implies (y, x) ∈R, for all x, y.
For example, the equality relation is symmetric.

terminal object
T
T0 space 
A topological space X such that,
for any two distinct points of X, there is a neigh-
borhood of one which does not contain the other.
That is, for all x, y in X, with x ̸= y, there is an
open set U such that either x ∈U and y /∈U,
or y ∈U and x /∈U. T0 spaces are also known
as Kolmogorov spaces.
T1 space 
A topological space X such that,
for any two distinct points of X, there are neigh-
borhoods of both which do not contain the other.
That is, for all x, y in X, with x ̸= y, there are
open sets U and V such that x ∈U and y /∈U,
while y ∈V and x /∈V . This is equivalent to
each singleton {x} being closed in X.
T2 space 
A topological space X such that any
two distinct points can be separated by open sets.
That is, for all x, y in X, with x ̸= y, there are
open sets U and V such that x ∈U, y ∈V ,
and U ∩V = ∅. See also Hausdorff topological
space.
T3 1
2 space 
A topological space X such that
X is a T1 space and points and closed sets in X
can be separated by continuous functions. That
is, for all closed C ⊆X and x /∈C, there is a
continuous f : X →[0, 1] such that f (x) = 0
and f (c) = 1 for all c ∈C. Including the condi-
tion T1 ensures T3 1
2 ⊆T3. See also completely
regular topological space, T1 space.
T3 space 
A topological space X which is a
T1 space and such that points and closed sets can
be separated by open sets. That is, for all closed
C ⊆X and x /∈C, there are open sets U and
V such that x ∈U, C ⊆V , and U ∩V = ∅.
Including the condition T1 ensures T3 ⊆T2. See
also regular topological space, T1 space.
T4 space 
A topological space X which is a
T1 space and such that disjoint closed sets can be
separated by open sets. That is, for all closed C
and D contained in X, if C ∩D = ∅, then there
are open sets U and V such that C ⊆U, D ⊆V ,
and U ∩V = ∅. Including the condition T1
ensures T4 ⊆T3 1
2 . See also normal topological
space, T1 space.
T5 space 
A topological space X which is a
T1 space and such that any two separated sets
can be separated by disjoint open sets. That is,
for all subsets A and B of X, if
A ∩B = A ∩B = ∅
(A and B are separated), then there are open sets
U and V with A ⊆U, B ⊆V , and U ∩V = ∅.
Including the condition T1 ensures T5 ⊆T4. For
any T1 space X, T5 is equivalent to hereditary
normality. See also T1 space.
tautology 
In propositional (sentential) logic,
a well-formed propositional formula is a tautol-
ogy if it is true under every truth assignment for
the sentence symbols in the formula. For exam-
ple, if A and B are sentence symbols, then
¬(A ∨B) ↔((¬A) ∧(¬B)),
(which is one of DeMorgan’s Laws) is a tautol-
ogy.
In ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst order lan-
guage. A tautology is any well-formed formula
ofLwhichisobtainedfromatautologyofpropo-
sitional logic by replacing each sentence symbol
in the tautology with a well-formed formula of
L.
term 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language. The set
of terms of L is deﬁned inductively as follows.
(i.) If c is a constant symbol of L, then c is a
term.
(ii.) If v is a variable of L, then v is a term.
(iii.) If f is an n-place function symbol of L
and t1, . . . , tn are terms of L, then f (t1, . . . , tn)
is a term of L.
(iv.) The set of terms is generated by rules
(i.), (ii.), and (iii.).
For example, in the ﬁrst order language of
elementary number theory (see ﬁrst order lan-
guage), S(0)isaterm(whichisintendedtoname
the natural number 1).

terminating decimal
one morphism f of C such that f : B →A. For
example, in the category of sets and functions, a
singleton is a terminal object. The dual notion
of terminal object is initial object.
terminating decimal 
A decimal representa-
tion
. . . a4a3a2a1a0.a−1a−2a−3 . . .
of a real number such that there is an integer N
with a−n = 0 for all n ≥N. A real number r
has a terminating decimal representation if and
only if there is an integer a and a nonnegative
integer N so that r =
a
10N . Clearly, any real
number with a terminating decimal representa-
tion is therefore a rational number.
ternary number system 
The real numbers
in base b = 3 notation. See base of number
system.
theorem 
In ﬁrst order logic, let L be a ﬁrst or-
der language, and consider a particular predicate
calculus for L. Let α be a well-formed formula
of L. Then α is a theorem of (or is deducible
from) the predicate calculus (notation: ⊢α) if
there is a proof of α in the predicate calculus.
See proof. If  is a set of well-formed formu-
las of L, then α is a theorem of (or is deducible
from)  (in the predicate calculus) if there is a
proof of α from  (notation:  ⊢α).
The notion of theorem in propositional logic
is entirely analogous.
theory 
A set T of sentences of a ﬁrst order
language L which is closed under logical impli-
cation; i.e., if σ is a sentence of L which is a
logical consequence of T , then σ ∈T (in nota-
tion, T |= σ implies σ ∈T ). Equivalently, T
is a theory if it is closed under deduction; i.e., if
σ is provable from T , then σ ∈T (in notation,
T ⊢σ implies σ ∈T ).
For some authors, the word theory simply
means a set of sentences, and the notion above
is that of a closed theory.
Let A be a structure for L. The theory of A
is the set of sentences of L which are true in A
(i.e., the theory of A is the set of sentences σ
such that A is a model of σ). The theory of A
is denoted T h(A) and is a complete theory. See
complete theory.
Thom complex 
Let E −→M be a real vec-
tor bundle on a manifold M. There is a disk bun-
dle D −→M which is given by the open unit
disk in each ﬁber of the vector bundle E. The
Thom construction is formed from E −→M
by identifying all points in E outside of D to a
single point, called the point at inﬁnity.
Example: Consider the Möbius band as a line
bundle over the circle S1. The Thom complex of
this bundle is the real projective plane.
This construction is used in the calculation
of cobordism groups. See R. Stong, Notes on
Cobordism Theory, Princeton University Press,
Princeton, NJ, 1968.
topological dimension 
Let X be a topolog-
ical space. The topological dimension of X is
the smallest non-negative integer n such that, for
every open cover A of X, there is an open cover
B that reﬁnes A (i.e., A ⊆B), with the property
that some point of X lies in an element of B and
no point of X lies in more than n + 1 elements
of B.
topologicalgroup 
Atopologicalspacewhich
is also a group such that the inverse and prod-
uct maps are both continuous. That is, the maps
g →g−1 from G to G and (g1, g2) →g1g2
from G × G to G are continuous.
Any discrete group is considered to be a topo-
logical group with the discrete topology that
states: any single element subset is an open set.
topological invariant 
A property preserved
by homeomorphisms. That is, P is a topologi-
cal invariant if, given any homeomorphism f :
X →Y, the space X has property P if and
only if Y has property P. For example, con-
nectedness, separability, and normality are all
topological invariants.

ber.

dinal.

truth table
transﬁnite induction 
A method of proof.
Suppose P (α) is some statement that describes
a property of α, where α is an ordinal. Suppose
that all of the following conditions hold: (i.)
P (α0), for some α0, (ii.) P(α) implies P(α+1),
for all α ≥α0, and (iii.) (∀β < λ) P(β) implies
P (λ), for any nonzero limit ordinal λ. From
these three, the conclusion is that P(α) holds
for all ordinals α ≥α0. Transﬁnite induction is
a generalization of induction.
transﬁnite ordinal 
Any ordinal that is inﬁ-
nite. For example, ω +3 is a transﬁnite ordinal.
transﬁnite recursion 
A method of deﬁn-
ing some function; also known as deﬁnition by
transﬁnite recursion, or sometimes as deﬁnition
by transﬁnite induction.
For any function g
on the universe of sets, there exists a unique
function f on the class of ordinals such that
f (α) = g(f |α), for all ordinals α. See also
recursion.
transitive relation 
A binary relation R such
that [(x, y) ∈R]∧[(y, z) ∈R] implies (x, z) ∈
R, for all x, y, z. For example, ≤is a transitive
relation on N since if n ≤m and m ≤k, then
n ≤k.
transitive set 
A set A such that, whenever
B ∈A, then B ⊆A.
tree 
A partial order (T, ≤) in which, for any
t ∈T , the set of predecessors of t, {s ∈T :
s < t}, is well ordered by <. That is, any non-
empty subset of {s ∈T : s < t} has a least
element. An example of a tree is the set of all
ﬁnite sequences of natural numbers, ordered by
extension: s < t if t extends s. Other exam-
ples include Aronszajn trees, Kurepa trees, and
Suslin trees. See Aronszajn tree, Kurepa tree,
Suslin tree.
triangular number
The integers in the se-
quence1, 3, 6,10, . . . (whichrepresentthenum-
ber of lattice points in the plane that lie on the
perimeter of isosceles right triangles having in-
teger length legs).
The triangular numbers are integers of the
form n
k=1 k.
truth assignment
In propositional logic, a
function v : S →{T, F} mapping a set S of
sentence symbols to {T, F}, where T is inter-
preted as true and F is interpreted as false. For
example, if S = {A1, A2, A3}, then a possible
truth assignment would be v : S →{T, F} by
v(A1) = F, v(A2) = T , and v(A3) = T . Note
that there are eight possible truth assignments
for this particular set of sentence symbols, since
there are two choices (T or F) for each value
of the function on an element of S. In general,
if S has n sentence symbols, then there are 2n
possible truth assignments on S.
A truth assignment v : S →{T, F} is ex-
tended using a recursive deﬁnition to a truth
assignment v on the set S of all well-formed
propositional formulas α which have sentence
symbols from S, as follows:
(i.) If α is a sentence symbol in S, then
v(α) = v(α).
(ii.) If α = (¬β), then
v(α) =
 T
if v(β) = F
F
if v(β) = T.
(iii.) If α = (β ∧γ ), then
v(α) =
 T
if v(β) = v(γ ) = T
F
otherwise.
(iv.) If α = (β ∨γ ), then
v(α) =
 T
if v(β) = T or v(γ ) = T
F
otherwise.
(v.) If α = (β →γ ), then
v(α) =
 T
if v(β) = F or v(γ ) = T
F
otherwise.
(vi.) If α = (β ↔γ ), then
v(α) =
 T
if v(β) = v(γ )
F
if v(β) ̸= v(γ ).
truth table
A table of truth values for a well-
formed propositional formula α, based on as-
signments of truth values for the sentence sym-
bols in α. In general, if there are n sentence
symbols in α, then the truth table will have 2n
rows. The truth tables for the formulas built up

tubular neighborhood 
A tubular neighbor-
hood of a simple closed curve L ⊂S3 is a neigh-
borhood of L homeomorphic to L × B2 where
L × {0} is identiﬁed with the curve L.
More generally, a tubular neighborhood of
an l-dimensional submanifold L ⊂M in an n-
dimensional manifold M is a neighborhood of
L homeomorphic to L × Bm−l.
Turing complete set 
A set A of natural num-
bers which is recursively enumerable and, for
any recursively enumerable set B, B ≤T A;
i.e., B is computable, relative to A.
An example of a Turing complete set is the
halting set K = {e : ϕe(e) is deﬁned}, where ϕe

number e.
Turingcompleteissometimessimplyreferred
to as complete.
Turing equivalent 
Two sets A and B of nat-
ural numbers such that A is Turing reducible to
B (A ≤T B) and B is Turing reducible to A
(B ≤T A). Intuitively, Turing equivalent sets
are sets that code the same information. Turing
equivalence (notation: A ≡T B) is an equiva-
lence relation on the class of all sets of natural
numbers. The equivalence classes of ≡T are
called Turing degrees, or degrees of unsolvabil-
ity.
As an example, any two Turing complete sets
are Turing equivalent.
Turing reducibility 
Let ϕ be a partial func-
tion on N; i.e., its domain is some subset of N,
and let A be a set of natural numbers. The func-
tion ϕ is Turing reducible to A if ϕ is (Turing)
computable, relative to A. See relative com-
putability. The notation ϕ ≤T A means that ϕ
is Turing reducible to A. If B is a set of nat-
ural numbers, then B is Turing reducible to A
(B ≤T A) if its characteristic function χB is
Turing reducible to A.
For example, given any set A of natural num-
bers, A ≤T A where A is the complement of A
in N. If B is any computably enumerable (re-
cursively enumerable) set and K is the halting
set {e : ϕe(e) is deﬁned}, where ϕe is the partial
recursive function with Gödel number e, then
B ≤T K.
twin primes
Two odd prime numbers p and
q so that q = p + 2. For example, 3 and 5 are
twin primes, as are 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and
19, and 29 and 31. Twin primes with over 3300

type
digits have been discovered, but it is unknown
whether or not there are inﬁnitely twin prime
pairs. The triple (3, 5, 7) forms the only “prime
triplet” since at least one of any triple of the form
(n, n + 2, n + 4) must be divisible by 3.
Tychonoff Fixed-Point Theorem 
Suppose
X is a locally convex linear topological space
and C ⊆X is compact and convex. Then any
continuous function f : C →C has a ﬁxed
point. That is, there is a c ∈C with f (c) = c.
Any normed vector space can be made into a
locally convex linear topological space by us-
ing the metric topology generated by the norm:
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥.
Tychonoffspace   See completelyregulartopo-
logical space.
Tychonoff Theorem 
The
product
of
any number of compact topological spaces is
compact in the product topology. For example,
since the unit interval [0, 1] is compact, any cube
[0, 1]κ is also compact. It is this theorem that
makes the product (Tychonoff) topology impor-
tant. The Tychonoff Theorem is equivalent to
the Axiom of Choice.
Tychonoff topology 
See product topology.
type
A type of a theory T is any set of formu-
las that is realized in some model of T . That is,
if T is a (possibly empty) theory in the language
L, then a set of L-formulas (¯x) is an n-type
of T if ¯x = {x1, . . . , xn} contains all free vari-
ables occurring in the formulas of , and there
is a model A of T and an n-tuple ¯a of elements of
A such that A |= φ(¯a) for every φ(¯x) in (¯x).
Some authors require types to be complete,
meaning they are maximally consistent.

uniform space
U
ultraﬁlter 
A subset U of a Boolean algebra
B, which is a ﬁlter, not properly contained in
any other ﬁlter on B. As a ﬁlter, U must be
nonempty, closed under ∧, not contain 0, and
be closed upwards: for all u ∈U and b ∈B, if
u ≤b then b ∈U. The maximality condition is
equivalent to requiring that for all b ∈B, either
b ∈U or ¬b ∈U.
Any ﬁlter can be extended to an ultraﬁlter,
and, using a weak form of the Axiom of Choice,
any subset of a Boolean algebra with the ﬁnite
intersection property can be extended to an ul-
traﬁlter.
ultrapower 
An ultrapower of an L-struc-
ture A is a reduced product 
U A, where U is
an ultraﬁlter over the index set I. The reduced
product is formed by declaring, for x and y in
the Cartesian product 
I A, that x ≡U y if and
only if the set of coordinates where x and y agree
is in the ultraﬁlter U:
{i ∈I : x(i) = y(i)} ∈U .
The reduced product 
U A is then the set of all
equivalence classes under ≡U .
The fundamental property of ultrapowers is
that, for any L-sentence φ, 
U A |= φ if and
only if {i ∈I : A |= φ} ∈U. But because U
is an ultraﬁlter, ∅/∈U and I ∈U, and so, the
ultrapower models φ if and only if the original
structure A models φ. Thus, 
U A ≡A.
See also ultraproduct.
ultraproduct 
An ultraproduct of a set of L-
structures {Ai : i ∈I} is a reduced product

U Ai, where U is an ultraﬁlter over the index
set I. See ultrapower.
The fundamental property of ultraproducts is
that for any L-sentence φ, 
U Ai |= φ if and
only if {i ∈I : Ai |= φ} ∈U.
umbilicalpoint 
LetM beasurfaceinR3, and
let k1 ≥k2 be the principal curvature functions.
See principal curvature. An umbilical point is
a point where k1 = k2. On the complement of
the set of umbilical points, the principal curves
form a pair of orthogonal ﬁelds of curves on
the surface; the umbilical points are the places
where these ﬁelds become singular.
unbounded set 
A set of ordinals C ⊆κ such
that, for any α < κ, there is a β with α ≤β < κ
and β ∈C. See also closed set, stationary set.
uncountable 
A set that is inﬁnite but not de-
numerable. For example, R and C are uncount-
able sets.
undecidable 
A set of objects of some sort,
which it is not decidable. See decidable.
uniformly continuous function 
A function
f : R → R such that, for any ϵ > 0, there is
a δ > 0 such that for x and x′ in R, |f (x) −
f (x′)| < ϵ whenever |x −x′| < δ. Any contin-
uous f : [a, b] →R is uniformly continuous.
More generally, a function f from one metric
space (X, dX) to another (Y, dY ) is uniformly
continuous if for any ϵ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such
that, for all x and x′ in X, dY (f (x), f (x′)) <
ϵ whenever dX(x, x′) < δ. If X is compact,
then any continuous f : X →Y is uniformly
continuous.
Further generalization of the notion is possi-
ble in a uniform space. See uniform space.
uniform space
A set X with the topology in-
duced by a uniformity U. Informally, a unifor-
mity is a way of capturing closeness in a topo-
logical space without a metric; that is, it pro-
vides a generalization of a metric. Formally, a
nonempty collection U of subsets of X × X is
a uniformity if it satisﬁes the following condi-
tions:
(i.) for all U ∈U,  ⊆U, where  =
{(x, x) : x ∈X} is the diagonal of X;
(ii.) for all U ∈U, U−1 ∈U, where U−1 =
{(y, x) : (x, y) ∈U};
(iii.) for all U and V in U, U ∩V ∈U;
(iv.) for each U ∈U there is a V ∈U with
V ◦V ⊆U, where
V ◦V =

uniform topology
and
(v.) for all U ∈U, if U ⊆V , then V ∈U.
The idea is that x and y will be considered U-
close to each other if (x, y) ∈U. Then, for
example, condition (i.) states that x is always
U-close to itself.
A uniformity U generates a topology on X
(the uniform topology) by considering the sets
U[x] = {y : (x, y) ∈U} as basic open sets for
each U ∈U and x ∈X.
uniform topology 
(1) See uniform space.
(2) The uniform topology on Rα is the topol-
ogy induced by the bounded sup metric
δ(x, y) = sup{min{|xβ −yβ|, 1} : β < α} .
This topology is the same as the product topol-
ogy if α is ﬁnite; if α is inﬁnite, the uniform
topology reﬁnes the product topology.
union 
(1) The union of any set X, denoted by
∪X, is the set whose elements are the members
of the members of X. That is, a ∈∪X if and
only if there exists S ∈X such that a ∈S. For
example, ∪{(0, k) : k ∈ Z} = R+. If X is an
indexed family of sets {Sα : α ∈I}, where I is
some index set, the union of X is often denoted
by 
α∈I Sα.
(2) The union of sets A and B, denoted by
A ∪B, is the set of all elements that belong to
at least one of A and B. This is a special case
of the previous deﬁnition, as A∪B = ∪{A, B}.
For example, {3, 10} ∪{3, 5} = {3, 10, 5} and
N ∪ R = R. See also Axiom of Union.
unit function 
The arithmetic function, de-
noted u, which returns the value 1 for all positive
integers, i.e., u(n) = 1 for all integers n ≥ 1.
(See arithmetic function.) It is completely (and
strongly) multiplicative.
universal bundle 
A bundle EG −→BG
with ﬁber G is a universal bundle with struc-
ture group G if EG is contractible and every G
bundle over X is the equivalent to the bundle
formed by the pullback of EG −→BG along
some map X −→BG.
Example: The universal real line bundle is
EO(1) −→ BO(1) equivalent to the covering of
BO(1) = RP∞ (inﬁnite dimensional real pro-
jective space) by S∞, the union over all n of
spheres Sn, under the action of Z/2 = O(1).
universal element 
If C is any category, S is
the category of sets and functions, and F : C →
S is a functor, a universal element of F is a
pair (A, B), where A is an object of C and B ∈
F(A), such that for every pair (A′, B′), where
B′ ∈F(A′), there exists a unique morphism
f : A →A′ of C with (F(f ))(B) = B′.
universal mapping property 
The notion of
a universal mapping property is not a rigorously
deﬁned one, as many variations exist. A com-
mon pattern that appears in many instances can
be described as follows. A triple (p, A, A′),
where A and A′ are objects of a category C and
p: A →A′ is a morphism of C, has a uni-
versal mapping property if, for every morphism
f : X →A of C, there exists a unique mor-
phism f ′ : X →A′ of C such that f ′ = p ◦f .
In most cases, a universal mapping property is
used to deﬁne a new object. A standard example
of deﬁning a tuple having a universal mapping
property is the product of objects in a category.
See product of objects.

universe of sets 
The collection of all sets.
In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), the uni-
verse of sets, usually denoted by V , can be ex-
pressed by the abbreviation V = 
α Vα, where
each Vα is a set from the cumulative hierarchy.
It is important to note that this union does not
deﬁne a set in ZFC, rather, the above equation is
simply an abbreviation for the following state-
ment which is provable in ZFC: (∀x)(∃α) x ∈
Vα. See also cumulative hierarchy.
unordered pair 
A set with exactly two el-
ements. For example, {3, −5} is an unordered
pair. Compare with ordered pair.

Urysohn’s Metrization Theorem
Urysohn’s Lemma 
For any two disjoint
closed subsets A and B of a normal topological
space X, there is a continuous f : X →[0, 1]
such that f (a) = 0 for every a ∈A and
f (b) = 1 for every b ∈B. That is, normal-
ity implies disjoint closed sets may be separated
by continuous functions. The converse is easier:
if f is continuous and separates A and B, then
f −1([0, 1
2)) and f −1(( 1
2, 1]) are disjoint open
sets containing A and B, respectively. Thus,
normality is equivalent to separation by contin-
uous functions for Hausdorff spaces.
Urysohn’s Lemma is a vital part of the proofs
of Tietze’s Extension Theorem and Urysohn’s
Metrization Theorem.
Urysohn’s Metrization Theorem 
Any regu-
lar, secondcountabletopologicalspaceismetriz-
able. In other words, if X is regular and has a
countable basis, then there is a metric that in-
duces the topology on X. The proof relies on
Urysohn’s Lemma and imbeds X in the cube
[0, 1]ω, which is also separable.

V
valid 
Let L be a ﬁrst order language and let
α be a well-formed formula of L. If, for every
structure A for L and for every s : V →A, A
satisﬁes α with s, then α is valid or is a validity.
(Here, V is the set of variables of L and A is the
universe of A.)

(v1 = v2 ∧v2 = v3) →v1 = v3

Venn diagram 
A schematic device used to
verify relations among sets contained within a
universal set U.
The universal set U may be represented by a
closed ﬁgure such as a rectangle. A set A ⊂U is
then represented by the interior of some closed
region within U, while the statement x ∈A
is indicated as a point within the region A. The
relation A ⊂B is depicted by placing the region
representing A within that of B.
The union A ∪B of two sets may be repre-
sented by shading the combined regions includ-
ing both A and B. The intersection A ∩B is
indicated by shading the overlapping portions
of the regions A and B and the complement of
A or A′ is indicated by shading the region within
U which is outside A.
The relation (A ∪B)′ = A′ ∩B′ is shown in
the ﬁgure. The top diagram indicates by shading
theset(A∪B)′ andthebottomdiagramindicates
the common elements of A′ and B′.

W
Wang exact sequence 
Let F −→E −→
Sn be a ﬁber bundle with n ≥ 2 and F path
connected. Then there is a long exact sequence
· · · −→H k(E) −→H k(F) −→H k−n+1(F)
−→H k+1(E) −→· · ·
called the Wang exact sequence.
This sequence is derived from the spectral
sequence for the ﬁber bundle, which in this case
has only one non-trivial differential. There is an
analogous sequence for homology. One can use
the Wang sequence to compute the homology of
the based loop space of a sphere.
wedge 
The one-point union of two spaces; in
other words, the wedge product of two spaces is
formed from their disjoint union by identifying
one chosen point in the ﬁrst space with a chosen
point in the second. In the category of pointed
spaces (spaces together with a base point), the
chosen point is the base point. For example, the
wedge of two circles is a ﬁgure eight.
well-formed formula 
In propositional (sen-
tential)logic, awell-formedformula (orwff)sat-
isﬁes the following inductive deﬁnition.
(i.) If A is a sentence symbol, then A is a wff.
(ii.) If α and β are wffs, then so are (¬α),
(α ∧β), (α ∨β), (α →β), and (α ↔β).
(iii.) The set of well-formed formulas is gen-
erated by rules (i.) and (ii.).
For example, if A, B, and C are sentence
symbols, then ((A ∧B) ∨C) is a wff, while
A∧ is not a wff. Informally, the parentheses
used in deﬁning wffs are often omitted when
doing so does not affect the readability of the
formula; in particular, it is always assumed that
¬, ∧, and ∨ apply to as little as possible. For
example, if A, B, and C are sentence symbols,
then ¬A ∧B →C means (((¬A) ∧B) →C).
In ﬁrst order logic, with a given ﬁrst order
language L, the set of wffs of L is deﬁned in-
ductively.
(i.) If α is an atomic formula, then α is a wff.
(ii.) If α and β are wffs, then so are (¬α) and
(α →β).
(iii.) If α is a wff and v is a variable, then
∀vα is a wff.
(iv.) The set of well-formed formulas is gen-
erated by rules (i.), (ii.), and (iii.).
Since {¬, →} is a complete set of logical
connectives, it is possible to use the other con-
nectives informally in well-formed formulas as
abbreviations for formulas in the actual formal
language L. In particular, if α and β are well-
formed formulas of L, then
(i.) (α ∨β) abbreviates ((¬α) →β).
(ii.) (α ∧β) abbreviates (¬(α →(¬β))).
(iii.) (α ↔β) abbreviates ((α →β)∧(β →
α)).
Informally, the parentheses used in deﬁning
wffsareoftenomittedwhendoingsodoesnotaf-
fect the readability of the formula, or even added
when doing so aids the readability of the for-
mula. It is always assumed that ∀applies to as
little as possible. For example, ∀vα →β means
(∀vα →β), rather than ∀v(α →β).
For example, in the language of elementary
number theory (see ﬁrst order language), ∀v1(<
(v1, S(v1))) is a well-formed formula, although
< (v1, S(v1)) is usually informally written as
v1 < S(v1).
well-founded relation
A partial ordering R,
on a set S, such that every nonempty subset of
S has an R-minimal element. For example, the
relation “m divides n”, on the set of natural num-
bers, is well-founded; the relation ≤on the set
of real numbers is not well founded.
well-founded set
A set X on which the mem-
bership relation is well founded. That is, any
nonempty subset of X contains an ϵ-minimal
element. A well-founded set cannot contain it-
self as a member.
well-ordered set
A pair (S, ≤) such that ≤
is a well-ordering of S. For example, (N, ≤) is
a well-ordered set. Also called woset.
well-ordering
A linear ordering ≤of some
set S such that every nonempty subset of S has
a minimum element.

Well-Ordering Theorem
linear ordering ≤ for numbers is a well-ordering
of N but it is not a well-ordering of R.
Well-Ordering Theorem 
Every set can be
well ordered; i.e., for every set there exists an or-
dering on that set which is a well-ordering. See
well-ordering. The Well-Ordering Theorem is
equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. See Axiom
of Choice. Consequently, the Well-Ordering
Theorem is independent of the axioms of ZF
(Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory); that is, it can nei-
ther be proved nor disproved from ZF.
Whitney sum 
The sum of two vector bun-
dles over a manifold, formed by taking the direct
sum of the vector spaces over each point. The
Möbius band M can be thought of as a vector
bundle over the circle (since the unit interval
(0, 1) is homeomorphic to R). This vector bun-
dle is distinct from the trivial bundle E = R1 ×
S1, but both Whitney sums E ⊕E and M ⊕M
are equivalent to the trivial bundle R2 × S1.
whole number
A non-negative integer.

breviated by the letter Z. See Zermelo-Fraenkel

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory 
The for-
mal theory whose axioms are: the Axiom of
Extensionality, theAxiomofRegularity, theAx-
iom of Pairing, the Axiom of Separation, the
Axiom of Union, the Axiom of Power Set, the
Axiom of Inﬁnity, the Axiom of Replacement,
and the Axiom of Choice. This axiomatic the-
ory is often abbreviated as ZFC (the letter C is

zero 
Symbol: 0
(1) A symbol representing the absence of
quantity.
(2) The additive identity of an Abelian group
A. The element denoted as 0 ∈A which has
the property that 0 + a = a + 0 = a for every
element a ∈A.
zero object 
An object A of a category C that
is both terminal and initial is a zero object of
C. Such an object is usually denoted by 0 or ∗,
and is also called a null object of the category.
For example, in the category of Abelian groups
and group homomorphisms, ({0}, +) is a zero
object. Any two zero objects are isomorphic.
zero section 
A map M −→E of a vector
bundle E −→M over a manifold M, which
takes each point m in M to the zero in the vector
space which is the ﬁber over m. That this map
is well deﬁned follows from the deﬁnition of
vector bundle.
Example: For any trivial bundle M × Rn,
M × {0} is the zero section.
The term zero section can also refer to the
image of the section map.

Zorn’s Lemma
If (P, ≤) is a nonempty par-
tial order in which every chain has an upper
bound, then P has a maximal element. In other
words, if for every linearly ordered C ⊆P there
is a pc ∈P such that q ≤pc for all q ∈C,
then there is one p ∈P such that q ≤p for
all q ∈P. Zorn’s Lemma is equivalent to the
Axiom of Choice.
