I really appreciate reading, the comments written by my new friend 
.Johnny Long, as he jqrst thanked his creator in his Penetration Tester's book 
by Syngress. I'm in.Johnny's camp in acknowledging that I can do nothing 
without the help of my Lord and Savior,. Jesus Christ. I dedicate my small 
part of this book to Him, my wonde~ul wife, Valerie, and my son, Tyler. My 
partner Don Withers is like a brother to me in every way. For eight years, 
we have been fortunate to produce our Techno Security and our new Techno 
Forensics conferences, which have had attendees register from over 40 coun- 
vii 

tries around the world. I wish that I had space to thank all of the other 
authors of this book. I know them all well, and I have known some of them 
for more than two decades. These are some of the most respected and talented 
security minds in the world, and I am honored to have my work in the same 
book as theirs. And last but certainly not least, I'd like to thank my good 
friend Russ Rogers for his technical editing help and Amy Pedersen from 
Syngress Publishing for being so patient as I learned the ropes of getting a 
book ready to be published.

Introduction 
Why a Book on Techno Security? 
This book has been in the making for about 15 years. There are many ways to 
convey valuable information, but in my opinion, there is no better way than the 
printed word. It simply doesn't go away once the ink dries. That's a good thing. 
Many of the authors of this book have been asked to express their opinions in 
every way conceivable. They are the world's experts, and their opinions and 
suggestions can help save companies from a lot of headaches and even embar- 
rassments. 
I have personally been interviewed about a dozen times on television news 
broadcasts. The interview would typically take about 30 to 60 minutes. The 
footage of the interview that actually was transmitted over the airways was 
about 10 seconds. Did any of you see or remember any of these interviews? 
Most likely not, and there is no practical way to go back and see even the 10 
seconds of information presented by an industry expert (their opinion) should 
you want to. It's just gone. Fortunately, the written word is here to stay.You can 
go back and reread any part of a book at your leisure. 
This book is meant to be a reference full of lessons learned, war stories, and 
suggestions, all of which will help you improve your professional and personal 
Techno Security posture. 
Our Authors' Writing Styles 
We have intentionally not tried to limit how our authors share their informa- 
tion. Most of my writing is in the first person. I have been a professional 
speaker and trainer for over 20 years, and I put words on paper as if I were 
xxxiii 

xxxiv 
Introduction 
presenting them in person at one of my presentations. That's just my style, and 
it's very conversational. Some of our other writers will put their words on 
paper in different ways. For some of the authors, this will be their first pub- 
lished work by a major book publisher. Others are very well-known authors 
with several books of their own already in print. 
One thing that all the authors do have in common, however, is their hard- 
earned knowledge in a variety of critical areas associated with Techno Security. 
The chapters addressing the various subjects covered in this first volume aren't 
compiled in any order of importance. Each one stands alone as a valuable refer- 
ence for the area covered. Many of the chapters will address issues that could be 
considered a subchapter of that chapter. 
Such critical countermeasures as physical security, employee awareness 
training, due diligence, risk mitigation, computer crimes, and working with law 
enforcement will be addressed as sidebars, tips, warnings, and suggestions in the 
respective chapters. Use them in whatever way you see fit. Many countermea- 
sures discussed would make excellent subjects for monthly or at least quarterly 
security awareness training classes. If you find and react to even one small tip 
found in this book, that could be worth much more than the small cost to pur- 
chase this book full of hard-earned written experiences of these Techno 
Security pioneers. 
Techno Security versus Computer Security 
There is a reason why we have called our conferences and this book Techno 
Security and not simply Computer Security.When deciding to come up with a 
name for our company and our first conference, we thought long and hard 
about a name that would be meaningful, that would be relevant for a long time, 
and that would not sound worn out or overused. 
As we all now know, technical security is so much more that just computer 
security. Just about everything that is important to every one of us now resides 
on some form of media in some database somewhere, and the ways of getting 
to that information are increasing every day. 
Topics like RFID security didn't even exist as a major issue when we held 
our first Techno Security conference just eight years ago. Many of the topics 
addressed so well in other books published by Syngress weren't even issues back 
then. There is so much more to be aware of now, that getting and staying secure ' 
is more than a full-time proposition for most companies. 

Introduction 
xxxv 
There is a lot more at risk as technology continues to advance beyond any- 
thing that we even considered just a few years ago. The threats targeting what 
we have at risk are increasing in sophistication each year. Our chances of being 
victims of these threats could grow simply because of a lack of knowledge of 
the new threats. The process of becoming aware of and implementing effective 
countermeasures is the name of the game in lowering your risk. This book is 
meant to help you do that. 
Stay safe out there.

Foreword 
We're thrilled to be working on this book with the Syngress Publishing team, 
along with so many of our friends, colleagues, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors 
at our annual Techno conferences. 
This book has been almost 10 years in the making. When my partner, Jack 
Wiles, and I started TheTrainingCo. in 1999, we also started our first Techno 
Security Conference in Myrtle Beach, SC. We quickly realized that as we got 
older, a lot of our friends had made their way to the top of the very exciting 
worlds of information security, digital forensics, and risk management. Many of 
them became our keynote speakers, presenters, and trainers as we grew the 
conference business. We had tremendous respect for these industry pioneers, 
and the Techno Security landscape was growing rapidly, and so too was the 
popularity of our conferences. That was a very exciting period. 
I remember meeting Jack in 1990 while we were on a train headed to 
Philadelphia. Jack and I quickly became good friends.We had similar values and a 
lot in common.We also shared a deep desire to help make a difference and give 
something back to the security cormnunity that we had been a part of for so 
long.As Jack took an early retirement offer and I moved on from the corporate 
world to a consulting firm, we began talking more intently about what we might 
like to do for our next steps in our professional lives. The more conversations we 
had, the more it became apparent to both of us that the training and conferences 
business was our choice.We both had prior experience and success in developing 
conferences and seminars.We also shared a real passion for wanting to create 
something new and innovative in the training conference business.

xxxviii Foreword 
We both believed that the training and conference business followed a 
cookie-cutter model. We also thought it was too expensive and restrictive. We 
believed it needed a company with a new perspective and appreciation for 
those people who work in the trenches in law enforcement, government, and 
communities in the private sector.We also knew that those same technical 
people wanted and needed a place to go for excellent training and networking 
opportunities at a reasonable price. The rest is history. We have enjoyed more 
than eight years of successful conferences and have met thousands of wonderful 
new people whom we now call friends. 
Once we started down the conference path, the thought of perhaps writing 
a book on the subject stayed in the back of our minds. We both had some 
writing experience, but taking on the task of a complete book was daunting. 
We did not consider writing a book as an undertaking in our immediate future. 
We did realize, however, that we had a lot of experiences and some terrific war 
stories to tell and share, and putting those words on paper was one of the best 
ways to make the thoughts come alive.We knew that we had some great con- 
tent, and we had several wonderful friends and colleagues in the business who 
also had things to share, but we just didn't know the best way to get started. 
Then one day out of the blue, one of our longtime friends, Russ Rogers, 
suggested that we get to know the team at Syngress. At first, we simply wanted 
to get to know the people at Syngress and invited them to our conference as 
our bookstore sponsors, since we had heard so many good things about them 
and the books they were creating. In 2005, our newest conference, Techno 
Forensics, was unveiled, and the Syngress team brought stacks of books to offer 
to our attendees who were interested in digital forensics and security. The 
books sold like hotcakes. As Jack, I, and the Syngress team got to know each 
other better, discussions about possibly publishing a book related to Techno 
Security began to be more frequent. As I said before, we had so many excellent 
writers as personal friends who were also considered industry icons that a spe- 
cial book written by these experts just needed to happen. 
I believe you will find that this book contains some of the most up-to-date 
information available anywhere on a wide variety of topics related to Techno 
Security. As you read the book, you will notice that the authors took the 
approach of identifying some of the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and then

discussing the countermeasures to address them. Some of the topics and 
thoughts discussed here are as new as tomorrow's headlines, whereas others 
have been around for decades without being properly addressed. 
I hope you enjoy this book as much as we have enjoyed working with the 
various authors and friends during its development.

Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering" Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
Introduction 
Some of the things I will discuss in this chapter have been on my mind since the 
mid-1980s. I believe it's time I put them in writing and present my thoughts on 
what I believe could be the most effective and dangerous threat to any security plan: 
social engineering! This age-old threat has taken on a new meaning as what I collec- 
tively call "bad guys" have continued to use the art of the con to gain access to 
intellectual property and, if necessary, the buildings that house it. 
This chapter isn't meant to be read as a complete story from beginning to end. 
Social engineering and ways to prevent it are subjects with many meanings. This will 
be more of a potpourri of tips, tricks, vulnerabilities, and lessons learned from 30- 
plus years of dealing with these issues. As an inside penetration team leader, I used 
every exploit I could to conduct a successful inside penetration test. It was during 
those years that I gained most of my social engineering experience. These skills 
helped me eventually hang up my dumpster-diving penetration team clothes and 
retire from the tiger team world UNDETECTED! Although I came close several 
times, I was never stopped or reported to security as a possible burglar or corporate 
espionage agent, even though that's what I effectively was while I had our teams 
inside their buildings. 
If you think this chapter has a strong risk management flavor, it was intentional. 
Just about every area of concern with security today is a risk management issue. This 
chapter, and most of the others in this book, are chock full of what I like to call 
Techno Tidbits of useful risk management countermeasures. Hopefully, many of 
them will be topics you might not have considered in the past as you put together 
your security plan. External, internal, and information system auditors should pick 
up a few ideas for things that should be added to their audit process. 
How Easy Is It? 
Way back in 1988, I was part of an internal security team for a large corporation. 
On several occasions, I had the opportunity to hear some of the conversations that 
went On when a cracker (bad guy hacker) group targeted a victim by calling them 
on the phone. They were using social engineering skills to gain access to proprietary 
information, including passwords. I'll never forget what I heard one experienced 
cracker say to a cracker-in-training: "Social engineering is the easiest way to break 
into a system." He then followed up that comment by saying "The stupidity of the 
average system administrator amazes me." 
That was almost 20 years ago and it was the first time I had heard the words 
social engineering. Why do I think of it as a tool that could be used by any "bad 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
3 
guy" from a cracker to a terrorist? Social engineering is what I believe could be the 
most effective and dangerous outsider-insider threat to any security plan. 
Over the past 15 years, I have learned firsthand just how easy it is to be an effec- 
tive con man as ! lead several inside penetration teams into clients' buildings who 
hired us to test their vulnerabilities. Not one time did we fail or get caught as we 
roamed their buildings pretending to be employees. Everyone we encountered while 
doing our thing thought we belonged there. 
Human Nature: Human Weakness 
This is certainly not the first time anyone has written about the effects of social 
engineering. It doesn't take much searching on the Internet to find material on the 
subject, and in almost every article you will note a common thread. In each case, the 
social engineer turns our normal human nature of wanting to be kind, helpful, and 
sympathetic into a weakness they can exploit. 
If we looked at this through the eyes of a risk manager performing a risk assess- 
ment, our untrained and unaware human nature could be considered a major vul- 
nerability, threatening just about everything important to our company. We'll talk 
about possible countermeasures to these threats throughout of the rest of the 
chapter. 
The reason I digressed into a full discussion about a risk assessment of the 
threat of social engineering is because I don't think many people have performed a 
detailed risk analysis. Since social engineering is a truly formidable threat, you 
need to know how vulnerable you are (at work and home) and what you can do 
to reduce those risks. 
Any risk assessment needs to consider at least four things: risks, threats, vulnera- 
bilities, and countermeasures. 
Risk Management: 
Performing a Mini Risk Assessment 
I recently had the opportunity to purchase my first boat. It's not huge, but it is just 
big enough for me to use as a floating mini-office a couple of days a week when the 
weather is nice. Just for fun, let's do a mini risk assessment of some of the risks, 
threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures associated with my new floating office. 
This isn't intended to be extensive (I'm sure you will think of things I didn't men- 
tion here). I just wanted to give us practice using terms most associated with risk 
assessments and risk management.

Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
What Do l Have at Risk? 
Being out on the water all day, my life is the first thing that comes to mind as a risk. 
The boat itself is also at risk, though I have passed some of the financial risk along to 
an insurance company, which is what we do with a lot of risks where it makes sense. 
Any equipment on the boat is at risk of not only sinking but of possibly being 
dropped overboard, or being soaked by a large wave. A sudden thunderstorm could 
cause problems. Depending on lake conditions, too many other boats could cause a 
problem. The battery in the boat could die causing me to lose all power and even 
strand me on the lake. As you can see, when you consider what you have a risk, you 
will immediately start to consider some of the threats that could possibly increase 
your risks. What I have at risk on the boat is everything I could lose if something 
bad happened. Let's call all the bad things that could happen "possible threats." 
What Are Some Possible Threats? 
We've already mentioned a few possible threats, which are different than those sur- 
rounding my home office. Weather could certainly be a threat, as could simply hit- 
ting something as I was moving from one place to another on the lake. The threat of 
a sudden thunderstorm, or of being hit by another boat, always exists. There isn't 
much risk of being hit by a car (hopefully), or suffering from a commercial power 
outage while I'm aboard. The possible threat of theft should be small as long as I 
keep an eye on my equipment while I'm launching the boat. Overall, the threats, 
which could possibly hinder my ability to conduct business from my boat, would be 
lower than most places. (Am I looking for reasons to work from my boat or what?) 
What Are Some of 
the Possible Vulnerabilities? 
I would be much more vulnerable to severe weather changes out on the lake than in 
my home office. I would also be vulnerable to lake conditions in general at any 
given time. (This is a large lake about 20 miles long.) For a few days following a 
heavy rain, hundreds of semi-submerged items float down stream. I would certainly 
be vulnerable to someone losing control of his or her boat and crashing into mine. If 
I didn't know the depth of the water I was in, I could possibly run aground or hit 
something in water that was shallower than I thought it was. It would most likely 
just be an inconvenience, but as in any vehicle, I could run out of fuel. I mentioned 
not being affected by commercial power failures, but I could easily run my only bat- 
tery down to where I couldn't start the engine to return to the marina. In addition, 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
5 
though I am always very careful, I could possibly fall overboard~a difficult problem 
when you're on the water alone. 
What about My Countermeasures? 
I really enjoy talking about countermeasures. The word even sounds cool.You have 
all of these things that you have identified as yours and they could be at risk out 
there in the boat.You have considered the possible threats and how vulnerable you 
might be as you encounter them. Now, what can you do to lower your risk and 
decrease your vulnerability? 
I've learned a lot during the few months I have had this new floating mini- 
office. Some of my newfound countermeasures are 
9 
I only try to be on the lake when most other boaters aren't out there. 
9 
I check the weather forecast every time before I head to the lake. 
9 
I will install a second marine battery to insure I always have power. 
9 
I have made sure special waterproof cases are used for my computer and 
cell phone. 
9 
I carry a small inverter onboard to provide me with 110 volts AC from the 
boat battery. 
9 
I make sure the marina and my family are always notified of where I will 
be, and when I expect to return. 
9 
I always carry a small marina radio onboard. 
9 
All data on my computer and cell phone have backup copies on shore. 
9 
I wear a self-inflating life vest at all times. 
I'm sure many more issues could be addressed in this mini-assessment, but the 
point is we all need to at least be familiar with, and understand, our risks at home 
and work. Included in this book is a detailed chapter titled "Personal, Workforce, and 
Family Preparedness," which contains a wealth of information for lowering your risk 
in some of the most important areas of your life. 
Outsider-Insider Threats 
For my definition here, let's consider the outside threats as those coming at you from 
the Internet or dial-up modem (You do know where all of your dial-up modems 
are; don't you?), or a simple phone call from a total stranger. The reason I mention 
www.syngress.com 

Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
dial-up modems is because there are still many of them out there. Many mainte- 
nance ports on older PBXs, building environmental controls, air handling systems, 
and access control systems still use them and probably will continue to rely on them 
well into the future. 
I'm not considering insider (current employee) activity in this chapter. Even 
though malicious insiders can use social engineering in a number of ways, the coun- 
termeasures for that kind of activity can be much different. For this discussion, let's 
consider outsider-insider threats as people who never were employees and didn't 
belong in the building. 
This would be the category my inside penetration team would fit into. When 
we roamed through buildings unchallenged, we definitely didn't belong there (other 
than being hired to try to get there). Someone checking out your building for pos- 
sible espionage or future terrorist activities would also fit in this category. In theory, 
some employee inside the building should eventually figure out that there is a 
"Trojan horse" in the camp. Someone who has gotten past whatever security there is 
at the perimeter where entry was gained. There is a good chance they used some 
form of social engineering to get there. 
Here'swhy I keep preaching about this subject and the subject of knowing who 
is in your building at all times. For more than three decades now, I have observed 
what I believe is a lack of awareness of this concern. Over the years, I have seen 
comparatively few articles address this silent but formidable threat. Remember, when 
I spent those years doing this for a living, we were hired expecting to get caught in 
an attack that was designed to become bolder the longer I had the team in a 
building. Toward the end of just about every job, we were openly walking around 
like we worked there, almost hoping to get caught by someone. We never did! 
We were good, but I suspect there are many "bad guys" out there who are much 
better at it than we were, and they won't try to get caught in the end like we did. 
We were also working under a few self-imposed rules that the real bad guys could 
care less about. Using forced entry, like a crow bar to get through doors or windows, 
was a no-no for us. Our main tools were a cool head and our social engineering 
skills whenever it made sense to use them. 
The Mind of a Social Engineer 
I'm not sure I'll do this part of the chapter justice, but I'll try. Although I've been 
involved with using and teaching about social engineering for almost two decades 
now, I didn't really understand why it works so well until about five years ago. When 
I was out in L.A. for a meeting on financial crimes security, I purchased a very inter- 
esting book tided The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick and William Simon.

9 Chapter 1

Just above the title on the cover of the book in red letters are the words 
"Controlling the Human Element of Security." I have since read most of the book, 
as well as many of the reviews written about it on Amazon. I found it to be well 
written and full of many good examples of how social engineering works and how 
companies can try to defend against its use. I also learned quite a few new 
approaches to targeting potential victims I had never thought of before. A social 
engineer will continuously learn increasingly clever ways to take advantage of how 
our minds work. The perfection of these skills comes from what Kevin Mitnick 
mentions in the The Art of Deception: practice, practice, and more practice! That's what 
every good social engineer does a lot of. 
The Mind of a Victim 
Any one of us, at any time, could easily become the victim of some form of social 
engineering. I believe it isn't possible to completely eliminate all risk, but some things 
can and should be done to reduce the risk as much as possible. I'll address some of 
them throughout the rest of this chapter. Without some form of training and that 
same practice, practice, and more practice idea in learning how to prevent being a victim of 
social engineering, you could easily become a victim and not even know it. 
Our minds work in very trusting and predictable ways, and that means exagger- 
ated deviations from the norm might never be considered. This is what social engi- 
neers count on. Without awareness of the problem and without an understanding of 
how our minds can be fooled, there is little defense against social engineering. For 
this awareness training to be of any benefit for an organization, it must include every 
employee of every organization. 
We see things all day long and we don't pay close attention to certain details 
because they are too familiar to us. That's exactly how the illusions that magicians 
call magic work. It's also why so many magic tricks are related to simple everyday 
things like a deck of cards. I use magic in much of my training and it really adds a 
lot to the attention span of the people in front of me. They are all so used to seeing 
those 52 cards that they don't think about how the different card gimmicks used in 
most card tricks work. Most of these illusions are self-working yet almost mind bog- 
gling to the unsuspecting mind. 
Here's a quick example of a short riddle that catches many people off-guard 
because of the way our minds work: 
I have two coins in my pocket that add up to 30 cents. One of them is not a nickel. H/hat 
are the two coins? 
I'll answer the riddle at the end of the chapter.

Cou ntermeasu res: 
How Do Bad Guys Target Us, 
and What Can We Do About It 
As I mention some of the countermeasures I consider important, I'd like to do so in 
a more novel way. This list certainly doesn't include all of the possible countermea- 
sures for trying to prevent a successful social engineering exploit. The Internet con- 
tains many other articles written by very experienced writers on the subject. I have 
read several of them and I agree with just about everything they suggest for coun- 
tering social engineering. 
The following is a list of some of the countermeasures I have recommended to 
companies we have performed penetration tests for over the years. Social engi- 
neering played a very important role in every test. In each case, it was the primary 
tool we used to perform the physical penetration of the client's building(s). Time 
after time, when we presented our after-action reports, most of the success of our 
penetration test was attributed to our inside team. 
Most of our clients quickly reacted to attempts to gain access from the outside 
over the Internet. Their intrusion detection systems worked pretty well, and their 
incident response plans were effective. They were completely unprepared, however, 
for us simply walking into their buildings and acting like we belonged there. Once 
inside, we pretty much owned the building and everything in it. In the larger build- 
ings, there were so many desks it didn't seem anyone knew everyone else. That was 
what we liked to see. Easy pickings. 
What follows are some of the most important things for you to consider as you 
plan your defense against possible social engineering attacks. 
Key Control 
The types of keys used in most buildings have remained virtually unchanged since 
Linus Yale invented them in 1861. Just about all of our homes, and most businesses, 
still use his pin tumbler locks for their primary physical defense. I have no way of 
knowing how often the master, grand master, and possibly great-grand-master key 
systems in buildings are changed. I do suspect it's not very often. This can be an 
expensive process. Recently, I walked into a public restroom in a large office 
building and saw a full set of keys, including the building master key, hanging from 
the paper towel dispenser. I suspect the janitor had just filled the towel rack and left 
his keys hanging there. In the hands of the wrong person, that collection could prove 
devastating. 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1

While using our social engineering skills during each penetration test, our team 
always tried to make friends with the cleaning crew. Sooner or later, we would need 
to ask a favor and borrow their keys for a few minutes. (Typically, their keys would 
open all of the doors on that floor and sometimes the entire building.) That was all 
it took for us to make a copy with the portable key machine we brought with us in 
a small bag. Very few people have any idea how keys and the locks they open work. 
This is another area of physical security that has changed greatly during the past few 
decades. I became a bonded locksmith back in the 1970s and found it fascinating. 
Back then, I couldn't even purchase lock picks or key blanks until I graduated from 
a credited locksmithing school and had proper identification. Now, about 30 years 
later, we have much more at risk in general, and anyone can purchase lock picks at 
several local hardware stores or from Internet-based stores with no questions asked. 
Regarding the use of lock picks to get into buildings and rooms, I doubt many 
"casual" social engineers use them. They do require a lot of that "practice, practice, 
and more practice" stuff needed for any social engineering skills. The availability of 
these devices for anyone to purchase is something corporate security specialists need 
to consider as they plan their countermeasures.

a system in place. It is very important to know who has the keys to 
:',~';'~i~!i'iliiiiiiiiiiiiiii~,~,~ your kingdom as well as how many doors can be opened by each key. 
It is very seldom a good idea to have one key that opens everything in 
the building. It may be more convenient for certain things, but it does 
create the security concern of controlling who has those keys and how 
easily they can be duplicated. 
Master keys are an additional concern if you rent space in a large 
building or office park. You might have a very strict policy of your 
own for your company, but if the management company that handles 
the building rentals isn't as careful with their master keys, the entire 
building is at risk. Unless the keys are of a high security design like the 
Medico line, they can be duplicated anywhere. Even if the disgruntled 
building maintenance person turns in his keys upon being fired, there 
is no way to be sure he didn't have copies made. You should ask the 
building manager about his policy regarding the issuing and security 
of the master keys. It will let them know you are aware there are keys 
to your office that are not under your control. 
Install special locks on critical doors. Highly pick resistant Medeco 
locks are some of the most effective. In addition to providing addi-

Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
tional security, they add another level of due diligence should you 
need to document your attempts to prevent intrusions. 
Conduct special employee awareness training for everyone who 
works on the evening and night shift. That's when I took our team 
into their buildings most of the time. We used our social engineering 
skills to befriend these people and to the best of my knowledge, we 
were never reported by any of them. 
Another prime target during our evening and night visits was the 
janitorial team. The main reason we always tried to befriend the 
people on the janitorial team is that they usually had those important 
keys we were trying to get our hands on. These are some of the most 
important people in your company when it comes to protecting your 
buildings when most employees are gone. They spend some time in 
just about every room in the building each week. If you don't train 
anyone else in your company, these people need to be well trained on 
how they can help. They should be made aware of your security poli- 
cies and what they should do if they see anything suspicious. This 
would include strangers, suspicious packages, doors that are opened 
which should be locked, and so on. They are one of your most valu- 
able resources. Tell them that, and teach them how they can help. 
Dumpster Diving Stil Works 
"Dumpster diving" is one of the easiest ways to find out information about a com- 
pa W or its customers. This is sometimes referred to as "trashing" and there have 
been a number of articles discussing what worked and what didn't for some experi- 
enced "trashers." One article discussed "advanced trashing" and ways to talk yourself 
out of a confrontation if you get caught. I'd be willing to bet that only a very small 
percentage of"dumpster divers" ever gets caught. As simple as this problem seems, it 
isn't given much attention by most companies. 
What kinds of things can you find in a company's dumpster? You would prob- 
ably be shocked if you started looking through your own dumpster occasionally. (I 
highly encourage you to do just that.) There may be old company phone directo- 
ries (still quite accurate and very valuable for use in social engineering), pieces of 
scrap paper with phone numbers and possibly passwords written on them, last 
month's customer lists that were discarded when the new list was printed this 
month, employee lists with home addresses and Social Security numbers, and so on. 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
11 
It doesn't take much imagination to think of all of the potential problems that 
could have their beginnings right there in your trashcan. Someone who is trying to 
pretend that they work for your company can use the old company directories. Most 
names in the directory, their work locations and their titles remain the same from 
update to update. These discarded directories are some of the most prized finds of 
any "dumpster divers" looking to get information about your company. The dis- 
carded scraps of paper with the passwords on them are also prized finds. Many times, 
they are discarded just because they were no longer sticky enough to stay on the ter- 
minal they were attached to, so a new one was written and the old one thrown in 
the trash. Last month's customer list will probably wind up in the hands of your 
competitor if the wrong person gets his hands on it. The employee list with the 
home addresses and Social Security numbers on it will cause different problems if it 
winds up in the wrong hands. 
What can you do about this problem? For one thing, we can all be a little more 
careful about what we throw in the trashcan. Management commitment to correct 
this problem, along with employee awareness of the problem will help solve it. This 
commitment usually involves the shredding or burning of all-important documents. 
If a company is going to invest in their own shredder, I always recommend a 
crosscut shredder over a strip cut shredder. Strip cutting is better than nothing, but 
crosscutting is much more secure. It turns the documents into small pieces of mate- 
rial instead of long strips that can be reassembled. I guess it's theoretically possible to 
reassemble a strip cut document, but if it falls into a bin with a large number of 
other strip cut documents, it will create the world's most difficult jigsaw puzzle. 
Old habits die hard, and this one will probably be no exception. As a country, we 
have been throwing away just about everything since the end of World War II. 
During the war, security was on everybody's mind, and each person encouraged 
their friends and neighbors to be careful what they said and what they threw away. (I 
wasn't around during World War II, but I was the product of a happy homecoming 
after the war.) As individuals and companies, we need to bring back just a little bit of 
that way of thinking. We need to become aware of this problem and encourage each 
other to be more careful with assets by being more careful with our trash.

Most of us are inundated with snail mail at home as well as at 
work. I have a policy in our home that nothing goes into our trashcan 
that has any family member's name on it. This requires a little extra 
effort to destroy a single page of a credit card offer each time I 
receive one. If it has a name and address on it (obviously everything 
that arrives at my home does), I destroy that part of the document. 
Every small thing I can do to protect my family against things like 
identity theft or credit card fraud helps me sleep at night. 
Employee Badges 
I know these can be faked, but I still think it's much better to have some form of 
visible identification worn by every employee at all times. Most of the companies 
that hired us did not have a policy requiring employees to wear their corporate ID 
badges all the time. This made our social engineering attempts much easier. Once we 
were inside the buildings, it was as if everyone just took it for granted we belonged 
there. Not only were we inside their buildings, but we had also breached their fire- 
walls and intrusion detection systems. 
Employees can be somewhat trained to even detect fake ID badges. I was 
working for a large company that did require employees to always wear their ID 
badges when they were on company property. This was back in the days when color 
printers were just starting to show up in homes and offices. I created a fake ID that 
was intentionally made without any thought of quality control. The first time I wore 
it into the building instead of my real ID, I suspected I would immediately be 
stopped and questioned about it. This was a security project, so I was prepared to 
explain myself. To my initial amazement, I never had to explain anything because it 
was never questioned. For the next three months, I wore it everywhere and not one 
person noticed. During one of our security meetings, I told everyone in our group 
about my little experiment and most people were quite surprised it was never 
detected. 
Part two of my experiment held the most interesting results for me, however. I 
created a picture showing my two IDs side by side. The fake one was quite obvious 
when compared with the real one. We began to teach people how to take a closer 
look at the IDs others were wearing as they walked through our buildings. From 
that time forward, I only wore my fake ID when I was conducting security aware- 
ness training for a group of employees. I was amazed at how many of my friends 
(who had been through a version of the training) would spot the fake ID as I was 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1

walking past them on the way to the training class. Some would even spot it from 
ten feet away. These are the same people who (before the class) hadn't noticed it 
while sitting 3 feet from me in my office. The lesson here" AWARENESS

i ii! !' Tailgating, frequently called p ggyback ng, 
s  ply following 
i!iii! ~ someone into a building after they open the door with an access card 
!ii!iiii!iiii~ or by entering a door code. The "bad guy" will often pretend to be 
searching for his or her access card while waiting for someone to 
enter with a legitimate card. If there is no guard at the entrance, the 
"bad guy" will probably go unchallenged and unnoticed. You really 
need to think about this one before you decide how you want to 
solve it. You can't place a legitimate employee in the position of 
having to challenge the "bad guy" about identification before letting 
them in. 
The legitimate employee probably didn't come to work for you to 
be a security guard. On the other hand, you don't want "bad guys" 
just walking into your building. This problem is as old as dirt, but the 
solutions just keep getting more complex and expensive. Some com- 
panies employ cameras that photograph everyone who enters the 
building. Others are now using biometrics scanners and other high- 
tech devices. As with everything else in the security field, you need to 
get a system that is appropriate in cost for what you are trying to pro- 
tect. 
At a minimum, you can make your employees aware of this threat 
and have them notify their immediate superior that someone fol- 
lowed them in, and then note the time and date of the incident. This 
same employee awareness session should instruct all employees to dis- 
play an ID so fellow employees who may not know them don't think 
they are "tailgating" as they walk in behind them. 
Shredder Technology Has Changed 
As with everything else these past few high-tech years, shredder technology has 
changed considerably. Our team had gotten really good at putting strip cut papers 
back together again. We used to take bags of it back to our office during the test.

14 
Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
Frequently, it was sitting outside in or near a dumpster where we simply picked it up 
and put it in our vehicle. Most of the time, documents that are strip cut shredded all 
fall neatly into place in the bag or box where they are stored, waiting to be disposed 
of. Our team was able to reassemble many of these documents within a few minutes. 
We would even take a document and paste the strips on a piece of cardboard in the 
shape of a Christmas tree, spreading the strips out as they were glued to the card- 
board. Even with up to an inch between strips, the documents were still easily read- 
able once reassembled. We never even attempted to reconstruct a document that had 
been sent through a cross cut shredder. 
~i~ ~ If you have too much invested in your strip cut shredders to replace 
'~141i~ I them, at least consider purchasing some of the small cross cut shred- 
i~,iiF~ii'i!i',J~!iiiiiii~i[ ders and place them directly in the offices of people who have espe- 
cially sensitive documents that should be destroyed. These small cross 
cut shredders are very inexpensive and durable if you keep them oiled 
with the special oil available for shredders. I have a small one that 
cost $39 and it creates a very small particle that would be next to 
impossible to reassemble. I have tried to wear it out for about six 
months and it just keeps on working. I'd also recommend encouraging 
all employees to get one for home use. I believe it is a good policy to 
shred everything that comes to your home with any family member's 
name on it. Once you start doing this, it will become second nature 
and you will never need to wonder who might see your personal 
information once it leaves your home. After all, identity theft is on 
the rise as well. 
Outdated but still sensitive documents should also be disposed of 
securely. When I worked at the Pentagon for the final seven years of 
my military career, we were required to place certain sensitive (not 
classified, simply sensitive) documents into a safe containing a burn 
bag. Burning them would then destroy these items. To this day, I still 
use a burn bag at home for documents that I need to destroy which 
are too bulky for my shredder. It's a great way to clean out the bar- 
beque grill on a cold sunny day. I feel good every time I destroy sensi- 
tive personal documents rather than simply throwing them in a 
trashcan. Left unshredded or unburned, they become possible fuel for 
the most rapidly growing white-collar crime in the country: identity 
theft!

Keep an Eye on 
Corporate or Agency Phonebooks 
When we were conducting a test, this was the first thing we went for. Once we got 
our hands on a corporate directory, the social engineering began. Most corporate 
phone books are laid out in a way that conveniently shows the entire corporate 
structure as well as the chain of command, building addresses, and department titles. 
That kind of information also lets us know the order in which to try entering the 
various buildings, if there were several. Wherever the Human Resources department 
was located was usually where we went last. Here's why. As we tried to enter all of 
the other buildings by simply walking in the door like we belonged there, we were 
frequently challenged by a receptionist and asked where we were going. Our social 
engineering answer was always the same. "We were told that this is where Human 
Resources is located, and we're here to fill out a job application." In every case, the 
receptionist simply sent us in the right direction. We thanked her or him and walked 
out the door and directly into the building next door to try the same con. The 
phonebook even gave us the Human Resources manager's name to drop if we 
needed to be a little more convincing that we belonged there but were simply lost. 
It also gave us the names and titles of the rest of the important people in the organi- 
zation whose names we could drop if we needed to when challenged. In addition to 
the names in the directories, most contained the physical location and chain of com- 
mand ranking for the most important person in each department. It was often their 
offices, file cabinets, and trashcans that we spent the most time in during our nightly 
visits. 
Employee awareness of how important a corporate directory is will help greatly 
with this one. Old directories are still quite accurate especially regarding buildings 
and department locations. They should be burned or shredded rather than simply 
thrown into the dumpster. 
If paper directories can be eliminated all together, that would even make our job 
a little tougher. Everything you do to make it a little harder for the bad guys will 
make you a less likely target~they're looking for an easy mark. Online directories 
are better only if you don't let the social engineers get into your building. Once we 
were inside, we began looking for a monitor with the infamous sticky pad note on 
the side listing the person's login ID and password. Once we logged on to the net- 
work as them, we could usually get to an online company directory if there was one. 
Let me address one additional countermeasure while I'm on the subject of the 
login ID and password that's been written down and attached to the monitor or 
placed under the keyboard. Maybe that doesn't happen where you work, but we 
www.syngress.com 

16 
Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
found at least one person who had done this on every job we were hired to do. 
There is another reason we like to use someone else's login ID and password to get 
onto their networks. If we are able to do that, not only are we on their network on 
the inside of any firewall, but everything we do will show up in some log as being 
done by the person who let us log in as them. Many larger companies now employ 
at least some form of two-part authentication using either biometrics or some type 
of handheld authenticating device to attain two-part authentication. Fortunately, 
some forms of biometric access control are becoming very reasonable in price. 
Everything you do in the way of authentication will greatly reduce your vulnera- 
bility in this form of instant identity theft. 
Tailgating 
This was one of our most successful entry techniques, regardless of the security pro- 
cedures at the building. For some reason, people in the outside smoking areas didn't 
ever question our being there and eventually walking in right behind one of them as 
they went back to work. We found that many corporations had good security at 
their main entrance points, but were lacking at other entry and exit points. We were 
able to gain access on several occasions through parking deck or garage entry points 
that required card access. We would simply follow someone who was headed to the 
door and walk in behind him or her as we were pretending to search for our access 
cards that didn't exist. 
'~ 
Here again, employee-wide awareness training and a strong security 
~' 
policy can go a long way in preventing this type of an entry. These 
~ ~.~ 
outside break, lunch, and smoking areas are frequently places where 
there are no security guards or receptionists trained to ask for proper 
ID as someone passes through the door. As mentioned earlier, having 
every employee wear an ID badge would make this type of entry a 
little more difficult should someone try to walk in without an ID. 
The countermeasures for this vulnerability really aren't as simple as 
we might think. Most employees entering a building aren't security 
people. They are simply trying to get back to work. Even though 
someone entering a building using the tailgating or piggyback 
method should be challenged, challenging them is an uncomfortable 
situation for most people. Unless there is a strong corporate policy 
requiring all employees to challenge anyone they can't identify, this is 
a difficult problem to deal with. At an absolute minimum, employees 

social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
17 
should be trained regarding when and how to notify security if they 
suspect an unauthorized person has followed them in. 
Building Operations" 
Cleaning Crew Awareness 
I can't emphasize enough the need to train all of your second- and third-shift 
employees, and especially your janitorial services people, about the threats of social 
engineering. Obviously, pre-employment screening, and possibly bonding, is essential 
for any outside firm you allow inside your buildings at any time. This is especially 
true for building access outside the normal 8 to 5 Monday through Friday standard 
work schedule. Frequently, these people have access to the master keys for a large sec- 
tion of the building and sometimes the entire building. They need awareness training 
to better prevent them from becoming victims of bad-guy social engineers who 
would like to borrow their keys for a minute or get them to open a certain room. 
This team should also immediately know whom to contact should they see any- 
thing suspicious that should be reported. If there is no immediate supervisor on duty 
during the evening or night shifts, everyone on that shift should know how to 
quickly contact their security forces. It can be very dangerous for them to approach 
a stranger themselves in an attempt to get them to leave. 
This suggestion may not seem to fit in the context of this book, but let me 
mention it anyway. There is another very good reason to train your janitorial team 
(at least the team supervisors) to be extra watchful during the evening and night 
shift work hours. I have been teaching bomb recognition classes for the past ten 
years. These same social engineering skills and physical building penetration methods 
could apply in any situation where the collective "bad guys" are trying to get into 
your building. The eyes and ears of the people who work in your building every day 
are critical when it comes to detecting anything, or anyone unusual in the vicinity of 
the building. Bomb recognition training for key individuals and as well as having an 
effective bomb incident plan are other countermeasures that can be employed to 
considerable effect.

Spot Check Those Drop Ceilings 
On several occasions, we used our social engineering skills to get into buildings and 
then install a sniffer in the telecommunications hub for that floor. I recommend all 
companies have their building maintenance teams perform a spot check above all 
suspended ceilings at least twice each year. We have been amazed at some of the 
things we found up there while we were conducting the penetration test.You may 
even stumble into a security vulnerability you weren't even aware of. 
This suggestion would also be one I would make if considering places to hide 
things like bombs. We walk under drop ceilings day after day and normally have no 
reason to think about what might be up there. Usually, there is at least a foot of 
clearance between the grid work holding the drop ceiling in place and the ceiling 
itself. I have seen as much as three feet of clearance.You may be amazed at what you 
find hidden up there (hopefully, it isn't ticking). 
Check for Keystroke Readers 
Some of our favorite tools are the software, and newer hardware versions, for 
keystroke readers. These can make a good social engineer's job a lot easier. If we 
wanted to find out what a certain individual in the company was doing on their 
computer during a certain timeframe, we would install a keystroke reader on their 
workstation on one visit and retrieve the results on a second visit. 
By far, the most effective keystroke loggers we have used are the Key Ghost 
hardware loggers being sold as security devices (www.keyghost.com). When these 
are installed between the keyboard of a workstation and the keyboard socket on the 
back of the computer, to the casual observer they look like they belong there. The 
one we used looked like the induction coils seen on some of the older parallel 
printer cables. It just doesn't look like anything you need to worry about. 
However, if you didn't put it there, you better be worried! It's logging every 
single keystroke you type in. 
The version we used would hold about 500,000 characters or half a megabyte. 
That might not sound like much, but just consider that the Word document that 
eventually became this entire chapter would take up about 20,000 characters (16,000 
characters for the text and about 4,000 backspace key strokes to correct all of my 
typing errors). That would only be about 4 percent of its capability. By the way, those 
backspace keys would show up as ASCII characters (control H for you techies) as 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
21 
would any other non-printing character entered as part of a password or whatever. It 
only records keystrokes, so it holds a lot more than you might think. We've left them 
connected to target computers for up to three weeks and still only filled about 80 
percent of their capacity. 
Here's something else to consider if you feel safer entering information into 
your Web browser over a secure socket connection (https). The encryption happens 
between your browser and the server that is receiving your sensitive information 
over the Internet. That's a good thing if you're entering your credit card number or 
bank account access information. But here's the problem with that warm fuzzy. The 
keystroke reader is reading your keystrokes before they get to your browser. 
Everything will be in the clear when someone (hopefully only you) looks at the data 
your keystroke reader collected. 
How do you know if you have one connected to your workstation or home 
computer? You don't unless you physically look back in the rat's nest behind most 
computers and see if anything looks strange. Unless you know what they look like, it 
probably won't appear strange to you even if you do see one. I pass one around for 
people to see at all of my security training classes. Statistically, I've read that people 
are 27 times more likely to remember something if they are able to see it and hold 
it. I usually ask my attendees to raise their hands if they've never seen one. Almost 
every time, more than half of the hands go up. How can you defend yourself against 
something you don't even know exists? (Another subtle hint for more awareness 
training.) 
Here's a quick awareness training class using one of my workstations as the target 
computer. The picture in Figure 1.1 shows the workstation in a minimum configu- 
ration with only a monitor, mouse, power cord, and keyboard connected to the 
motherboard. Take a look at that little bulge about three inches from the end of the 
cable that goes to the monitor. It's the only cable that has a bulge of the four that 
you see. That's an induction coil and you may see one or more on cables found 
behind most workstations.

Figure 1.1 No Keylogger... 
Let's take a look at this same workstation after I have installed my keystroke 
reader between the keyboard and the motherboard socket where the keyboard was 
connected (see Figure 1.2). Of the two cables in the center next to each other, the 
keyboard cable is the one on the right. 
Figure 1.2 Keylogger... 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
23 
Now what do we see when you look back there? The keystroke reader looks 
like a second induction coil and would be very hard to detect if you didn't know 
what one looked like. I didn't try very hard to hide it, and normally there are more 
wires back there than this. There is no way the computer would know it is there. It 
uses virtually no power, and doesn't require any software be installed to make it 
work. When I finally remove it and take it back to check out the internal log, the 
computer (or you) would never know it was gone again. 
The keystroke reader is an excellent security device if you suspect someone is 
using your computer when you're not there, and is sold primarily for that purpose. 
It's a wonderful piece of equipment.., as long as you know it's there. 
Check Those Phone Closets 
If your office is in a rented space, or in a multitenant building, it's a good idea to 
have someone perform a thorough check of your hardwiring for the phone lines. 
You don't know who was there before you were, and old wiring sometimes isn't 
removed when new tenants move in. On more than one occasion, our teams found 
old phone cable wiring still in place and being used in an inappropriate manner by 
inside employees. While we are on the subject, Techno Security also comes into play 
when considering the corporate PBX (or Private Branch Exchange), which is the 
internal phone company for larger corporations. It may still have a modem for 
remote maintenance needs, and the phone number for that modem may be written 
on the wall near the modem. We found many of the PBXs we "visited" to be very 
social engineering friendly. 
Remove a Few Door Signs 
It always amazed us to see rooms that had a sign over them saying Computer Room or 
Phone Closet. Obviously, the people who work there know where it is, and there is 
no reason for anyone else to know what's in there. It's all right for the room to have 
a number on the door that building maintenance would understand, but there is 
little reason to make it so easy for the bad guys to know where their best target is 
on that floor. This may sound like I'm getting a little too picky, but I'm not. The 
more difficult you make it for people who don't have a need to know about these 
critical rooms, the more secure you will be.

If you are going to have high-security locks on any doors in your 
building, dedicated computer rooms and phone closets would be high 
.......... ~iiiiii:~ ........ on my list of rooms needing the most secure locking mechanisms. 
Review Video Security Logs 
Normally, after we have completed our mission and have taken all of the "evidence 
that we have been there" out to our vehicle, we would reenter the building and try 
to be seen by the building security cameras we knew were there. Hopefully, there 
were some we didn't know about. We would even jump up and down waving our 
arms just to see if anyone would actually report us. As far as we know, we were never 
reported as being seen on the cameras' tapes. One of three things must have hap- 
pened. Either the cameras weren't working (unlikely), or the people looking at the 
playback of the video missed seeing us on the tape (probably unlikely) or they were 
never looked at (most likely). I'd recommend that someone in the company periodi- 
cally test this process. If there were internal auditors in the company, this would be a 
good audit step. That big expensive surveillance system is worthless if whatever is 
captured on tape is never seen by a human who can do something about it. 
This is another area where I believe the people responsible for the systems' 
techno security need to talk with those responsible for physical security. Cameras 
and lights have always been excellent countermeasures in and around buildings and 
homes. They scream "go find an easier target" to the bad guys. Some areas may 
require additional cameras to help improve the security of critical areas or rooms. 
The team responsible for overall physical security might not know of these places 
unless you tell them. They may already be monitoring areas you aren't aware of, 
which could help you if an incident occurs. 
The reason I mentioned homes several times throughout this chapter is because 
they are another soft spot when it comes to physical penetrations or social engi- 
neering. Many people now do much of their work from home on workstations 
using high-speed Internet connections. Personally, I employ as much physical secu- 
rity at my home office as at every other office I have worked. The technology asso- 
ciated with home security products has increased significantly, while the prices for 
that security have dropped, along with the cost of the latest computers. 
I recently installed a number of digitally controlled security cameras around the 
perimeter of my home, as well as motion-activated security lights in all approach 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
25 
areas. This may sound a little paranoid, but I know that I am much more protected 
than most of my neighbors, and my family feels safe knowing it would be difficult to 
commit any crime on our property without someone knowing about it. The cam- 
eras are also motion activated, so the only thing I see is activity detected by the soft- 
ware. With the rapid advances in technology, these kinds of sophisticated security 
systems are very affordable and powerful. 
Motion-Sensing Lights 
Most of our social engineering-based inside penetration tests would have been 
much less successful if the companies that hired us had motion-sensing light controls 
installed in every office throughout their buildings. These same sensors then turn the 
lights off after a pre-set time once the last person leaves the room. 
Every penetration test we were hired to conduct gave us several opportune 
buildings to enter, and every one had at least a few lights on all night long. While 
conducting our initial surveillance, that was one of the first things we noted. Are 
there lights left on at night, and if so, are they the same lights every night? In most 
cases, in a building with, say, 15 floors, six or eight lights would be left on. Our 
assumption was that whoever was assigned to that office was either still there, or they 
forgot to turn the light off when they left. Either way, it helped us significantly. If a 
random number of lights were left on each night, the security forces would not have 
an easy way of determining if everything was "normal" at any given time. 
As they patrolled from the outside (we watched them do this from the outside, 
and also from the inside once we got into the building), they really had no reference 
for what was a normal building profile. As we became bolder towards the end of a 
penetration test, we would even turn certain lights on just to see if security would 
become suspicious of this activity. No one ever did. 
Several of the buildings we penetrated didn't have anyone working in them at 
night. If motion-sensing lights had been used throughout these buildings, we would 
have looked for softer targets. If we had entered a room in a completely dark 
building, the light coming on would have been very abnormal for any security team 
member who saw it. 
There is another good reason to install these sensors. Over time, the energy 
saved by having the lights automatically turn off when no one needed them could 
eventually pay for the cost of the sensor. 
Check All Locks for Proper Operation 
During each penetration test, we found at least one lock (either interior or exterior) 
in the building that wasn't functioning properly. This provided us with easy access to 
www.syngress.com 

26 
Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
buildings and rooms that we shouldn't have been able to get through so easily. If 
employees are trained for just a few minutes on how to check if the locks on the 
doors they use every day are working properly, this vulnerability can be all but elimi- 
nated. Building maintenance teams should also take a close look at all locks at least 
twice each year. Slightly misaligned strikes on the doorframes are the most common 
problem found. This is a serious problem because it defeats the purpose of the lock's 
dead bolt. It takes me less than a second with my trusty finger nail file to see if a 
particular lock has this problem. If it does, I'll know (and have the door opened) 
instantly. 
~~ARNING~ 
~!~ Don't forget to check, those locks and doors at home. We also recom- 
~J 
mend that lock combinations (kegs) be changed immediately after 
~ 
occupying a new home, or after moving into a home that was owned 
by someone else. Keys are easy to duplicate, and you have no way of 
knowing how many copies are already out there, even for a brand 
new home. I'd also recommend changing the codes to your garage 
door openers as well, which is very easy to do with most modern 
openers. 
If you have a garage door opener installed, do not leave it set to 
the default code (frequently 000000 or something very generic). This 
could make you vulnerable to another form of wardriving where the 
bad guys simply drive around neighborhoods with generic openers 
trying to see if any doors open as they drive past. This gives them a 
nice potential target for a future break-in. Also, many houses that 
have house alarms don't have an alarm on their garage door. Even 
worse, the keypad for turning the house alarm on or off is frequently 
located next to the garage entrance inside the house. 
If you ever find your garage door opened and you didn't open it, 
I'd recommend immediately changing the door opener (and receiver) 
code. 
The Elephant Burial Ground 
I've been making a simple statement at presentations for the past ten years: "A new 
computer is a wonderful thing, but as soon as you buy it, it's already obsolete." 
Technology continues to change at a rate that few of us even notice. My statement 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
27 
isn't meant to be negative in any way. It's just that the computer is doing exactly 
what those new calculators did 35 years ago. They simply get faster, better, and 
cheaper as soon as you walk out the store's door. I'm not suggesting you don't buy 
the new (soon to be old) computer, you just must realize you will likely need a new 
one in two years. 
What happens when that "elephant" you purchased a few years ago finally dies 
or becomes too old to do any work for you? I'll bet it gets moved to your elephant 
burial ground with the rest of the electronic equipment that still looks new and 
valuable but isn't fast enough to keep up anymore.You can't simply put it out for the 
trash man to pick up, so there it sits, sometimes for years. 
This burial ground was a prime target for our penetration teams as we con- 
ducted vulnerability tests inside our clients' buildings. We frequently used our social 
engineering skills to find out where the old computers were stored. If it was in a 
locked room, we would find a way to either get someone to open the door for us, 
or we would use our lock picks or pick gun to open the door. 
Figure 1.3 shows pick sets similar to the one I've owned for over 30 years, while 
Figure 1.4 shows a pick gun comparable to mine. It doesn't take a lot of practice to 
learn how to use the latter. If you are thinking about running out and buying some 
of these tools, please be sure to read the warning I have included below the pictures. 
I don't want to have to include you in a future war story about what NOT to do 
with lock picking equipment.

in~e a to pursue lock picking as a hobby, or as a part of conducting 
your own "official" penetration test, you still need to be sure you are 
not breaking the law in any way by making or using these tools. 
As with almost any subject today, there is a wealth of information 
on the legal issues associated with lock-picking, and which are avail- 
able on www.google.com by entering "are lock picking tools legal to 
own," or something similar. 
The "bad guys" I collectively refer to throughout this chapter most 
likely won't care if they are legal or not. But you should! 
Once we found a room that contained some outdated equipment, and so knew 
we were going to leave with some very valuable intellectual property. All we did was 
open a few computer cases, remove the hard drives, and neatly close the case back 
up. How valuable was the information on that drive, and how soon would you know 
it was missing from the elephant burial ground?

Most likely, you would never know the disk drives are gone. Our experience has 
been that these older computers are seldom powered on again by the organization 
that owned them. They may get powered on by whoever eventually winds up with 
them at some junk auction or thrift store where they were donated. If they sit in any 
onsite location for any length of time, the chances of anyone ever knowing that the 
entire computer is missing, much less the hard drive itself, are very slim. For the 
most part, it could remain an undetectable crime. 
How valuable was the information on the old drive? Our experience has been 
that about 80 percent of the information on the old drive may still be of value to 
the "bad guys." If you think through the process of how that computer wound up in 
the burial ground, you will see what I mean. If the data on the old drive were prop- 
erly backed up as a part of your disaster recovery plan, then it would most likely be 
restored to the new computer prior to retiring the old one. As soon as everything 
looked fine on the new computer, the old one may never be powered up again. 
Technical issues are associated with each of the processes just described, but I 
didn't go into that detail here. Here's the bottom line from my experience with 
these old drives. If they weren't properly whipped clean, and if the drive itself was 
operational, we were able to get to the data on them with no problem.

a 200MB disk drive for $200. I was the first person in my circle of 
friends to own a drive of this size, and all for a mere $1 per 
megabyte. Today, 200GB disk drives can be found for as cheap as $50, 
after rebates. That's about 25 cents per gigabyte, which means that 
the same $1 per megabyte (actually worth less today) would buy me 4 
GB, or 4,000 times as much storage space for the same dollar spent. 
The tip here is to be careful with those old disk drives. This applies 
to the computers at home as well as at the office. Much valuable data 
is on them, and the risk escalates as the storage capacity of every 
drive climbs rapidly each year.

Internal Auditors Are Your Friend 
Just about everything I have mentioned in this chapter would make a good spot 
check audit point for an internal auditor. Someone on the good-guy side of the fence 
needs to check for these possible vulnerabilities and insure that the proper counter- 
measures are employed before they are exploited and become security incidents. 
My experience with auditors over the years has been that things usually happen 
once they have made a suggestion to improve an area of concern. Many larger cor- 
porations have information system auditors who are primarily responsible for 
looking after the company's technical world. It's a lot to keep up with. 
Most mid-sized corporations have internal auditors who are responsible for IS in 
addition to all their auditing tasks. 
Always Be Slightly Suspicious 
The number one countermeasure for social engineering is to be a little more suspi- 
cious than we normally are as friendly, trusting Americans. This holds true for social 
engineering attempts whether by way of a phone call or a visit from an amicable 
salesman. We all just need to be a little more aware of what is going on around us 
and those persons who might be pretending to be something they aren't. 
Unfortunately, this is a difficult countermeasure to keep ongoing. Still, we should 
not become complacent in this area. If we do, it will make life much easier for future 
bad guys. This and most of the countermeasures suggested in this chapter will help 
mitigate all of these threats. 
Get Every Employee Involved 
I've been saying this over and over for close to two decades now. I don't care what 
kinds of sophisticated security devices are employed for physical access control or 
network access control with intrusion detection, firewalls, incident response, and so 
on, there will always be a large hole in a security plan if it doesn't get all of its 
employees involved with the protection process. 
Social Engineering 
Awareness: A War Story 
The phone rang at nine o'clock in the evening way back in the late 1980s. It was 
our national technical support group on the line. The caller said he had spoken to 
the day-shift supervisor, and that he needed to run a test by having us log in to our 
www.syngress.com 

32 
Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
maintenance port while he was on the line. This was a UNIX-based operating 
system, and back then we always logged in as root. That was a very standard system 
administrator login ID and there was no need to guess it. What this social engineer 
needed was the password. In very official sounding language, he managed to con- 
vince our evening-shift computer operator that he was going to run a test to check 
the security of the password as the operator was entering it. The passwords them- 
selves don't appear on the screen (echo is turned off, for you techies out there) but 
the characters are sent in the clear. The person on the other end of the line said that 
something wasn't working correctly. He couldn't see the password coming in to him 
(obviously, it wasn't really going in to him anyway). He then asked our operator to 
try again. The second time the operator had the same results. The pretend technical 
support group person began to sound a little frustrated. He finally said, "What pass- 
word are you entering? I'll try it from this end."The unsuspecting social engineering 
victim was then told that this fake support person would get back to him when the 
problem was corrected. Obviously, he never heard from this person again. 
Unfortunately, this was before our pre-awareness days, and the caller got what he 
was after. He had done his homework and come up with just enough information 
to sound "official" and catch our evening person off-guard. In a story with a happier 
ending, the same thing happened two years later, but we were completely ready for 
it this time. Our employee wide awareness program was paying off. 
This process of calling and getting information from an unsuspecting victim over 
the phone is a form of remote "social engineering" in the "bad guy" circles. It's quite 
effective when used against an unsuspecting victim. Making sure every employee 
(especially everyone who answers the company phones) aware of this threat is your 
only defense against it. By asking questions back to any suspicious caller, you will 
drive away most of them. Ask for a number to call them back on. That doesn't guar- 
antee anything, but I've heard a few clicks as the phone is hung up after I've asked 
for a number. 
At a minimum, be aware of this highly probable threat and decide ahead of time 
what kinds of questions will, and will not, be answered about the company over the 
phone. This is an area where employees can get involved. At a monthly meeting, a 
"Social Engineering Attack Drill" can be staged. I've never been fond of role-playing 
sessions, but this is one area where it could be both fun and effective. The incoming 
caller can be engaged in industrial espionage, competitive spying, intentional destruc- 
tion, just plain curiosity, or any number of things. If the team representing the com- 
pany prepares for the questions that might be asked over the phone, there is a good 
chance they will hit on most of the questions the real social engineers will ask. 
Once our employees were made aware of this threat, their antennas went up as 
soon as a call came in that was even the slightest bit strange.Yours will, too.You 

Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
33 
don't want to be insulting or rude to anyone who calls into your business. That's just 
not good for customer relations, and most businesses need customers to call them 
every now and then.You can be firm and alert sounding while still being nice to the 
caller. Gently let them know you are not about to give out any unnecessary infor- 
mation over the phone. If they are legitimate callers, they will come to appreciate 
your protection of company information. It may even be information about them, 
and who wouldn't want that protected? 
Other good things start to happen as an awareness program filters through an 
organization. As employees learn more about the reasons for tighter security (such as 
keeping the company, and their jobs, from going down the tubes), they will tend to 
stop trying to circumvent existing security measures. 
I learned something else from the seminars I gave years ago: employees are very 
much interested in helping with the overall security posture of their company. I 
started receiving copies of newspaper articles from former attendees, in case I hadn't 
seen them. I was starting to be made aware by my students, and it was rewarding for 
all of us. This internal network was starting to grow and security was becoming a 
challenge instead of a chore. 
Something else I started took off as well as my homegrown awareness seminars: 
my security awareness posters. I wanted to make posters that were effective, eye 
catching, and cheap. My self-imposed criteria also demanded that they be easily 
reproducible on a standard copy machine. With those thoughts in mind, I sat down 
with a clipart book and let my imagination do the rest. After two hours, I had 
enough clipart drawings, and clever sayings to go with them, to design posters for 
the next two years. I sent out a new poster every three months to a select group of 
people. It didn't take long for others to call and want to be added to my list for 
receiving the next poster. Some people started to collect them and line them up 
along their walls. 
After I spent six months sending these posters to whoever wanted one, a stranger 
I had never seen before in our building visited me. He came to my desk, said hello, 
and introduced himself as a corporate external auditor who was auditing a group in 
our building. I knew and worked with a number of our own internal auditors, but 
this was the first real live external auditor I had ever met. He made me feel at ease 
very quickly though by telling me he wanted to meet with the person who 
designed the posters. They were so simple, yet so effective, he wanted to take them 
back to his company. I said thanks and to help himself. 
Here's a quick example of what I did for one of the posters. Using an interesting 
clipart picture of someone sitting in front of a computer, which included a caption 
that read "Take Advantage of Today's Technology," I simply added four words, cre- 
ating what became my most popular poster. Below the phrase "Take Advantage of 
www.syngress.com 

34 
Chapter 1 9 Social Engineering: Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 
Today's Technology" I added, in large print, "THE BAD GUYS WILL!" It was that 
simple. 
With the clipart available today, you can come up with some excellent ideas very 
quickly. I even started a contest to see who could submit the most interesting poster 
suggestions for the foll0wing year's posters, even awarding prizes to the winners. All 
it takes is a little imagination and off you go. Have fun! 
As the demand for my internal security awareness seminars increased, I was faced 
with an ever-growing problem. More and more groups wanted to see the presenta- 
tion, and I couldn't possibly get to all of them. After all, giving these seminars wasn't 
even part of what my immediate group was supposed to do. My next step was to 
recommend a video be prepared and used by all of the groups that I couldn't get to. 
The initial reaction was that it could be too expensive. A studio quality video can 
cost over $1,000 per minute to create. Even a 30-minute video would be out of the 
operating budget for most groups at $30,000. That wasn't what I had in mind. 
Something much less elaborate was what I was suggesting, and with the help of 
a friend with a video camera, it was created in less than two hours for just about 
zero cost. Just to see how it would look, we ran the camera during an entire 30- 
minute session that I presented to a small group. We then created a video of nothing 
but the slides that were used. The remaining hour was spent editing the two videos 
together. Our intent was to try this a few times until we got it right. We were trying 
to come up with something that would be cheap (the most important part at the 
time) and effective. We had no idea how successful our first attempt would become. 
Over 100 copies of it were sent all over the company, and most copies were shown a 
number of times throughout the next year to insure everyone had a chance to see it. 
As far as I know, it is still being shown. 
I've shared all of this here for a reason. If I can do it, so can you or someone else 
in your company. I learned that homegrown videos are quite popular. In some ways, 
they gain a certain additional creditability if they are "real life" and not overly com- 
mercial. The equipment to create them is getting more sophisticated and less expen- 
sive all the time. If you try this yourself, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at 
the outcome. 
There was someone else in the company that was pleasantly surprised by my 
seminars, posters, and videos: our internal auditors and attorneys. It was going a long 
way towards giving them plenty of good "Due Diligence" examples of what we as a 
company were doing to prevent computer security violations, both internal and 
external. Along those lines, I always encourage people who either attend a seminar, 
or view a video to make a note that they have had some security awareness training. 
As people all over the company do that, there will be an ever-growing population 
that is proof of the company's "Due Diligence" intent. 

Social Engineering" Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures 9 Chapter 1 
35 
To help with this, I created a "Certificate of Attendance" that I send to everyone 
who attended one of my seminars. These are another low-cost and highly effective 
"Due Diligence" statement. Even though they are inexpensive to create, they are 
very nice and frameable. In fact, as I traveled around, I saw a number of them 
hanging near the desks of former attendees.You could create your own company 
certificate as easily as I did. All that you need is some good certificate stock (blank 
paper), a word processor, and a laser printer. After you experiment with the fonts and 
word sizes, you can keep a template that only needs to have the names mail-merged 
to create the documents. They will look as good as any you'll ever see, and you will 
have one more thing that the internal auditors will love to see hanging on the walls. 
There is one final thing that an effective awareness program will help your com- 
pany with, but I always dislike mentioning it. It will help deter "inside" activity. 
Unfortunately, every statistic I have ever read on the probability of security violations 
has pointed towards the "inside" of companies. (For more on this threat, read Dr. 
Eric Cole's book by Syngress titled lnsider Threat.)

Answer to the Riddle 
The two coins are a nickel and a quarter. I know what you're thinking. I said that 
one of the coins was not a nickel. That's true. One of the coins is a quarter. The 
other one is a nickel. 
Summary 
I've thrown a lot at you in this combination of risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and 
countermeasures associated with social engineering. What I have tried to address in 
this brief chapter is what I consider the low-hanging fruit that the bad guys are very 
aware of. Most of the vulnerabilities mentioned are fairly easy to fix once you know 
about them. Most of you who read this book won't be responsible for correcting 
many of them, but you might be able to get this book to someone in your organiza- 
tion who can. 
Security will always be a long-term team effort. This is true for every company 
and every home. If you have a computer in your home and you access the Internet 
to pay your bills or check your bank statement, you need to consider security every 
time you do so. Even though we live in a technical world that will do nothing but 
get more technical, we can't forget about physical security at home and work. If you 
become a victim of identity theft, you will spend about two years getting your 
financial life back in order. Prevention is your absolute best countermeasure for 
most, if not all, of these possible threats. 
Thanks for reading all of my keystrokes as I put my 30 years of lessons learned 
on paper. 
Stay safe out there!

Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
Introduction 
In this chapter, we'll discuss the need for a personal, workplace, and family emer- 
gency plan. We'H cover the basics of creating a plan for you and your family, identi- 
fying and obtaining the basic supplies you will need in an emergency, and why being 
prepared is so vitally important to you, your family, your community, and the nation. 
We'll also discuss workforce preparedness and the new urgency that applies to this 
important area in business continuity planning. 
Threats 
We live in a time and a nation where one can no longer take a "neutral position" 
regarding preparedness. As individuals, families, and workgroups, we are either an 
asset or a liability for our communities and nation when disaster strikes. To be an 
asset, we must be prepared. 
You must be able to care for yourself and your family or you must depend on 
others to take care of you when disaster strikes. For too long, we have abandoned 
one of the founding principles that have made this nation great: self-reliance. "It's 
not my job" or "we have people to take care of that" when discussing preparedness is 
a far too common response. 
Being prepared is having the ability to take care of yourself and your family at 
home, work, or school during an emergency situation. Likewise, business and gov- 
ernment agencies must prepare to keep operating and supplying the goods and ser- 
vices that our communities need so as to return to normal life quicker. 
A family that has a disaster plan, supplies, and know-how in order to 
comfortably shelter in-place or evacuate during a severe storm, nat- 
ural disaster, or other emergency will lessen the impact of whatever 
the emergency might bring. 
Since September 11, 2001, our nation and the world have awakened to the very 
real threat of terrorism. While terrorist acts against the United States were not new, 
the scale of the coordinated attack of September 11 finally made even the most 
skeptical citizen realize we are a primary target for politically or religiously moti- 
vated acts of criminal violence. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
39 
While terrorism demands constant vigilance, so do the other threats that cause a 
tremendous loss in lives and dollars. Natural disasters, accidents, workplace violence, 
and crime also require our constant attention and preparedness. 
While the average citizen can do little to stop these catastrophic events, they can 
prepare now to lessen the impact on themselves, their families, and their work envi- 
ronment. The first step in this preparedness process is to accept the fact that "it can 
happen to me" and "it can happen here." 
Since Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005, FEMA and other gov- 
ernment agencies have been clear in warning all who will listen that local state and 
federal government resources cannot save everyone. They cannot supply all the 
requested food, water, medical supplies, manpower, and infrastructure repairs 
requested in a widespread disaster in a matter of a few hours or days. With such 
things as the Katrina recovery, for example, we need to include months and years in 
our recovery projections. 
For many years, the official recommendation was that you must be able to take 
care of yourself and your family for a minimum of at least 72 hours. Actually, two 
weeks is a more realistic estimate nowadays, given that the threat of a worldwide 
pandemic is a growing concern. 
Public health experts are warning us that a major health crisis brewing in Asia 
will affect the entire world. We are being told that when a pandemic hits our nation 
(not if), it will be a very different disaster from any we have experienced in recent 
history. A pandemic will not only bring interruptions in key services and supply 
lines, but in the way we work and live for 12 to 18 months, perhaps longer. How 
can a business survive if the normally reliable electrical power, phone service, cus- 
tomers, suppliers, and workforce are missing? 
How will our lives change when the schools and shopping malls close? In a 
highly contagious pandemic, few of us would want to find ourselves standing in a 
line to receive food or other basic supplies. 
Our workplaces will change dramatically. The new terms of"social distancing," 
"lone worker," "virtual office," and "virtual workforce" will become commonplace. 
Not only must a workforce be prepared for power and communications outages, it 
must now be prepared to use new tactics, including social distancing, family pre- 
paredness, sheltering-in-place, and workforce continuity to reduce the impact of this 
new threat. 
Preparing yourself and your family for emergencies requires more than just good 
intentions and a willingness to take care of yourself and your loved ones. Being pre- 
pared means much more than just having cash in your pocket and a "good" credit 
card ready to go. Preparedness means having a plan and the resources on hand to be 

40 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
totally self-sufficient during a natural disaster or other major emergency until nor- 
malcy is restored. 
The Internet has made a wealth of family and workplace preparedness material 
available. "ready.gov,"The American Red Cross, and other "official information" sites 
now offer information for a variety of age and reading levels. Official government 
pamphlets and booklets promote family preparedness and many commercial publica- 
tions discuss this important topic. Being informed is important, but being read), is abso- 
lutely imperative. 
"Workforce continuity" is defined as planning to have employees or contractors 
support the core business functions regardless of their work location. If the work- 
place is unreachable due to weather, road conditions, or some other workplace 
emergency, the employees can work from alternate locations or even from home. If 
an employee can't work for whatever reason, "workforce continuity" planning means 
training a backup to be ready to fill in for the missing worker. This may be other 
company employees or in some cases, outside contractors. 
Workforce continuity also entails planning for a dramatic increase of absenteeism 
rates. If 40 or 50 percent of the workforce cannot or will not report for physical or 
virtual work, how does the enterprise survive? 
It's smart to plan for the unexpected and use the Internet and wireless access to 
it to continue doing business. Virtual call centers and other technology depend 
heavily on the Internet and communications networks. What happens if those net- 
works and other infrastructures are unavailable or so overtaxed that they become 
useless for mission critical use? 
After all, what is the total capacity of the Internet? Internet Wodd Stats reports 
that as of late 2006 there were 1,093 billion Internet users in the world. Now let's 
suppose that the majority of these users are currently working at home to support 
their employer's operations or are trying to keep abreast of the latest emergency 
information. At what point does the Internet cease to be a useful transport mecha- 
nism due to the demand for bandwidth? Probably long before the last user signs on. 
A business that depends primarily on the Internet as a solution to a large-scale 
disaster or manmade crisis will be disappointed. Virtual office and a mobile work- 
force are ideal solutions to many of today's environmental and business scheduling 
problems. However, a solution that depends heavily on public infrastructure for suc- 
cess is doomed from the beginning. The only dependable solution is a reliable work- 
force willing to be there when needed to keep the business running. 
Business leaders must understand that they we now face the very real possibility 
of not having enough employees to keep the business "in business." 
Let's talk for a while about what's really important in your life, and what's really 
important in your family's life:YOU. Do you have a personal emergency plan? Does 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
41 
your family? Most individuals and families believe they will think about this when 
the time comes. Unfortunately, when a disaster strikes, there is little warning and the 
"planning" gets replaced by panic and uncoordinated responses to the event. 
Your Personal Preparedness Plan 
Let's start with that most valuable asset: "you."You need to have a plan, and you need 
to make sure your family and co-workers know what that plan is. If they are part of 
your plan, they surely need to know that now. And yes, just as with any plan, yours 
needs to be tested routinely. 
We'll discuss workplace, home, and family preparedness a bit later in this chapter. 
It is vitally important to remember that personal, family, workplace, and community 
emergency preparedness complement each other. 
Most of us spend the majority of our lives between home and work. If an emer- 
gency is preceded by a warning period (a winter storm or hurricane), you will have 
time to plan your response. In a winter storm, for instance, you'll probably stay at 
home or will be instructed to report later than usual by your employer. In the event 
of a fire, earthquake, or other unexpected emergency, your response must be imme- 
diate.You must act quickly to save your life and perhaps the lives of others. 
iii~iiiiiiiiii~ Your personal goal is to make sure you survive and remain healthy, 
'! !!! !i~ regardless of what the emergency situation may be. Getting out of a 
iii)'i':'~) ~I::':II dangerous situation and staying out of the way are paramount. Being 
prepared will reduce your mental and physical stress levels and 
increase your ability to assist others. 
The first step in your plan must be the protection of your own life. Personal 
safety experts will tell you to "always be aware of your surroundings." That's excel- 
lent advice. Look around; walk around your home and workplace. Where is trouble 
most likely to occur? Is flooding from a nearby creek or river possible? Are you near 
any major railroads or highways where transportation accidents may impact you? 
Do the same "walkabout" inside, too. Are there dangers you've ignored in the 
past? Could any of these be used against you and/or your home or workplace? Be 
aware of unlocked exit doors, trip hazards, and blocked exits. 
Wherever you work, know the environment, and if the situation requires, know 
how to get out quickly. Make sure you know where the emergency exits are, and if 
r 
9

42 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
the one closest to you is blocked, where the next closest exit is located. How long 
does it take you to exit your facility? Do these exits have battery-operated escape 
lights? If not, provide your own with a small flashlight or chemical light sticks. 
If you work in a multistory building, are you physically able to walk down the 
exit stairs? If not, make sure you can. Even if you are in good physical shape, stairs 
can be a challenge. If you are physically unable to walk down stairs because of med- 
ical reasons, find "escape buddies" to help you get down or check with your 
employer to determine the locations of any identified evacuation safe havens. 
If you're shopping, at the movies, spending the night away from home, or con- 
ducting personal business in a building you're not familiar with, know how to get out.

Having a personal preparedness plan will make you and your loved ones safer. 
After all, they depend on you. A personal plan should include the following:

Everyone needs a few basic resources if circumstances strand you en route 
to home/work/school. (See the next section on the subject of escape 
packs.)

Always know the location of the nearest fire escape in your workplace, 
school, or hotel if traveling.

Familiarize yourself with the emergency exits and procedures on commer- 
cial buses, trains, and aircraft.

Remember my 3G rule: "Get out, Get away, and Get in touch." Regardless 
of where you may be, always remember to get out of danger, get away from 
the danger, and let your family, friends, and employers know you are safe. 
Don't get caught standing outside your workplace due to an evacuation and 
wondering "now what"? Your personal response plan must cover not only safely get- 
ting out, but safely getting away if necessary. If you drive to work, where are your 
vehicle keys? Can you get into your vehicle if your keys are in your coat, hanging 
beside your desk? Hide a key under, around, or near your vehicle. In the case of key- 
less entry, keep an ignition key hidden inside the vehicle. If you're carpooling, make 
sure everyone in the group knows how to get in, too. 
One of the simplest ways to make sure you have basic items to help you respond 
in an emergency situation is to pack them now before you need them. This small 
"escape pack" is designed to help get you out of trouble if an emergency interrupts 
your normal routine. I'll also explain what these items are since I'm not a big 
believer in buying (or carrying) a bunch of"stuff" just for the sake of doing so.You 
can also purchase commercially available kits that provide some of the same items. 
However, if you assemble this kit yourself, you'll be more familiar with the contents 
and how to use them. 
This is not a "survival kit" in the general context. It will supply your immediate 
needs in case you find yourself"on the street" unexpectedly due to an emergency in 
your workplace. All of these items can easily be packed in a small nylon pouch gen- 
erally sold as "camera case."

Workforce Preparedness 
While the subject of workforce preparedness can fill an entire book, I want to 
devote some time to discuss its importance and offer some suggestions to help begin 
the planning process. 
The most valuable asset any enterprise or organization has, regardless of its size, is 
its workforce. These are men and women who make a company run day-to-day and 
create ideas and products to serve its customers and communities. Until recently, the 
majority of business continuity efforts revolved around processes and systems that the 
company depends on to keep operating. Little attention has been paid to the most 
critical support process, those employees and their families who make the enterprise 
successful. 
Throughout this section I use the descriptions of workplace, organization, 
agency, business, employer, and enterprise. These are generic terms of that place you 
call "work." I realize there are thousands of public and private sector operations and 
agencies that, while not motivated by profit, do have products, services, and delivery 
obligations. 
The threat dynamics have changed dramatically in the twenty-first century and 
every aspect of our normal lives is now considered a possible target for terrorism. 
Senior managers must realize that interruptions to the normal flow of business may 
include community evacuations, workplace violence, lengthy supply chain interrup- 
tions, mass casualty situations, and direct attacks by individuals or groups using 
unconventional weapons. Do not assume your workplace is safe from these new 
threats, or old ones such as fire, natural disasters, or criminal activity. 
An organization that only prepares for the occasional power failure, fire, hurri- 
cane, winter storm, or work stoppage is no longer exercising due diligence in the 
www.syngress.com 

46 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
protection of the assets of that enterprise. Every organization, large or small, must 
have a business defense plan (business continuity plan) that includes protection and 
preparedness of the core operational functions, employees, and their families. In a 
community-wide emergency or disaster, companies and public agencies need their 
employees to return to work as quickly as possible to limit losses. A company or 
government agency may provide critical services that will be vitally necessary for the 
recovery of your community from the event. That company or agency must be pre- 
pared to continue operations. If an employee must choose between family and 
workplace, family will win every time. Senior executives, managers, and agency 
directors can no longer tell their employees that "we expect you to be here when 
we need you, under any circumstances" and be assured of a successful recovery. 
Any organization that seeks to prepare their key processes for unexpected inter- 
ruptions must maintain a prepared workforce to support those critical functions. 
You may have heard the relatively new term workforce continuity. It's defined as 
having an uninterruptible and trained workforce that can continue the critical oper- 
ations of the organization under any circumstances. Generally, this means planning to 
use virtual workers when weather or other conditions make travel to the primary 
work location hazardous. Cross-training employees to fill in for job functions that 
are not ordinarily their responsibilities is another workforce continuity tactic. Having 
contract employees on retainer is yet another. 
~ii~~!~Simply having a contingency plan in case of tro ubleisnolongerade-

quate. For the foreseeable future, we must expect trouble and make 
iiiiiii~:iiiiii~:iill 
I~II~: sure each of us~as well as our families, workplaces, and communi- 
ties~ are at a higher level of readiness. 
A well-developed business continuity plan that prepares the key businesses pro- 
cesses, employees, and employee families is no longer just smart planning. It is now 
critical to the survival of our economy (along with due diligence). 
The most valuable asset your business, agency, organization, or home has is you. 
You, your family, co-workers, and stakeholders keep the enterprise running, and suc- 
cessful. What happens at home and in your personal life outside the workplace has a 
direct impact on how well you do your job. In an emergency situation, most people 
think of home and family first. Is everyone safe? If you are at home, will you report 
to work in a time of crisis? Will you leave your family to help your employer con- 
tinue operations? 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
47 
It's vitally important that every enterprise, regardless of whether it's a major cor- 
poration, small business, or government agency have plans to guarantee the safety of 
its employees. In fact, law in many instances requires it. However, don't assume that 
just because you participate in a "fire drill" that you are safe. Does your workplace 
have a safety committee? Are building evacuation plans documented? If an event 
happens in your community or workplace that places you in danger, how are you 
notified? Does your employer expect personnel to report to work under any condi- 
tions? If so, what are they doing to guarantee that? 
The workplace that prepares employees and families by sharing preparedness 
information, plans, training, and support will have a workforce that is ready and 
willing to get things back to normal quicker than the unprepared. Replacing the fear 
and uncertainty in an emergency keeps the workforce, stakeholders, and families 
focused on recovery, not only in the enterprise but in the family unit and commu- 
nity as well. 
Steps for Successful Workforce Preparedness 
9 
Draw up a written business (or operations) continuity plan (BCP) 
9 
Share the plan with employees and families as appropriate 
9 
Exercise the BCP plan routinely 
9 
Update building evacuation plans and practice carrying them out routinely 
9 
Monitor local and national current events and share pertinent information 
with employees 
9 
Conduct personal safety, first-aid, and CPR classes for employees 
9 
Offer personal and family preparedness instruction and information 
I've heard~and you probably have, too~the story about occupants in a multi- 
tenant building looking out of the windows to see a parking lot full of other 
building occupants. This usually means that the emergency alarm didn't sound or 
someone forgot to pass the word. Tragically, it can and does happen in real emer- 
gency situations generally related to workplace violence or bomb incidents. 
An alerting system that can be used to quickly inform the entire population of a 
building, or an entire community for that matter, saves lives. This tends to be bells, 
horns, or sirens. However a building "enunciation" or public address system offers 
more control of the alerting process and evacuation. Electronic message boards, dig- 
ital paging, and instant messaging to all LAN users are additional and highly effective 
ways of alerting and sharing emergency information quickly.

Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
Get Out, Get Away, and Get in Touch 
Federal, state, and local laws require that a workplace have an emergency evacuation 
plan (depending on the number of employees and the building structure) that must 
include an alerting system and annual exercises. Just getting everyone out, however, is 
not enough. For everyone's sake, you must prove it. That's not a new federal regula- 
tion; it's common sense. After all, would you want to be left behind and not be 
missed until it's too late? 
In any emergency, remember the 3Gs rule of personal protection, which help 
remind you to get out, get away, and get in touch. Get out of danger~in this 
example, your workplace during an emergency. Get away~don't stand on the side- 
walk in front of a building that may collapse or explode. And finally, get in touch 
with your supervisor, co-workers and family to let them know that you are 
accounted for. 
First responders arriving on the scene at a fire, explosion, or building collapse will 
ask "is everyone out?" If you're the senior manager or building owner, you'll save 
time and precious resources by answering "everyone is accounted out" or be able to 
direct rescue teams to specific locations where missing workers were last seen. 
If you cannot account for everyone, firefighters or search and rescue teams may 
have to search the building, and that puts lives at stake: those left behind and those 
searching. 
In a large facility, your workplace evacuation plan should include "shelter loca- 
tions."These assembly points inside the building~usually in fire escapes or other safe 
havens~offer shelter to injured or physically challenged employees. Such locations 
should be well marked and include some form of communication to a central emer- 
gency control point.Your local fire department can assist your efforts in identifica- 
tion and planning. Preparing a workplace evacuation plan includes the following. 
9 
Senior management must make it clear to every employee that when told 
to evacuate, they should do so immediately, without hesitation, and in an 
orderly fashion. 
9 
Permanent "meeting points" outside the building are identified and 
assigned by department or work location where a roll call is conducted. 
The results are communicated back to an evacuation control point by two- 
way radio or runners. 
9 
A central permanent "evacuation control point" is established to collect and 
distribute information from the evacuation. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
49 
9 
Each department, section, or floor must have assigned "fire wardens" or 
"evacuation coordinators" who keep current rosters of all shifts and 
employees. These rosters are carried to, or stored at, the outdoor meeting 
points. 
9 
The control point relays the roll call and any injury reports to emergency 
responders. 
9 
The "all clear" signal to return to the facility (or other such information) 
can only be issued by the evacuation control point. All information or 
requests for assistance from the meeting points must go to the control 
point--no exceptions. 
9 
Routinely exercise the plan. 
The meeting points mentioned in the preceding list should be located as far from 
the building as practical. Just being out of the building does not mean the workforce 
is out of danger. Most buildings today are constructed with beautiful glass exteriors. 
An explosion can send glass shards and other debris flying hundreds of yards. 
One general concern expressed to me by executives of several corporations is 
that "fire drills" reduce production time and that's why they are rarely done more 
than once a year--which, by the way, is not enough. I recently helped a large com- 
pany redesign their evacuation plan based on the preceding information. Each evac- 
uation coordinator was assigned not only rosters but an inexpensive two-way radio 
and a bright yellow bag to carry them in to the meeting point. That company now 
routinely evacuates 800 employees from a multistory building, conducts a roll call, 
reports results, and returns all employees to the building in 15 minutes during evacu- 
ation drills. The executives of that company are proud of this accomplishment and 
their employees are safer. 
In the event of an actual emergency, a final evacuation responsibility that you 
have to your family is to let them know your condition and plans as soon as possible. 
If your workplace does not have an updated building evacuation plan, inquire 
about starting one. Ask your supervisor, safety committee, or safety director. This 
would also be a good time to get involved by offering to help make it happen or to 
make an existing program better with your participation. 
Some workplaces have well-documented evacuation plans, and area evacuation 
coordinators ensure that all employees in their respective areas understand the plan, 
have "escape buddies" to help them if necessary, and "sweep" their assigned areas in 
an emergency making sure everyone has left the area. This is excellent safety plan- 
ning, but these plans must be practiced routinely. Unfortunately, far too many orga- 
nizations pay too little attention to this vital preparedness planning. If you work in 
www.syngress.com 

50 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
an organization that has not updated its evacuation planning or if you don't fully 
understand the plans, get involved and make your workplace and yourself safer. 
Are first-aid kits distributed for emergency use in your workplace? If so, where 
are they and are they properly supplied? If they are not adequate, point this out to 
your safety director or supervisor. Know how to use the supplies in a first-aid kit. If 
you're unsure, enroll in a basic first-aid course. Such skills make you, your family, and 
co-workers safer in any circumstance.Your employer will probably be more than 
happy to arrange onsite classes through the local chapter of the American Red 
Cross. 
Family Preparedness Plan 
We create and work plans every day of our lives. We plan our days, what to wear, 
who to meet, where to go and how to get there, and what to eat. These are for the 
routine, good things in life. Why then don't we plan for the bad things that can sur- 
prise us and threaten our safety? 
One of the most chilling memories of the 2005 hurricane season was the CNN 
coverage of the hundreds of cars running out of gas on streets and highways as 
Hurricane Wilma approached. These "average Americans" were stranded, hungry and 
scared. I could not help thinking that a bit of planning would have avoided most of 
this suffering. These families probably didn't have a family ready kit, a full gas tank, 
or extra cash on hand. They had not considered the possibility that another hurri- 
cane might strike so soon after Katrina. They aren't alone in their denial; most 
Americans believe that bad things happen to other people. 
Every book on family preparedness includes a list describing items that should 
be kept ready for use in an emergency situation. I've included a list (the Family 
Ready Kit) later in this chapter, but the kit doesn't work by itself. It's more impor- 
tant for family members to know what to do than to count on a box or bag of 
"stuff." Family preparedness is a state of mind--it's planning, practicing, and working 
together as a team to thrive, not just survive, in emergency situations. 
The most important point in family preparedness is family communication. Talk 
about what your family plans to do in the event of a major storm, natural disaster, or 
terrorist incident. Talking through what you expect, what might happen, and what 
"we as a family" will do removes a tremendous amount of stress and fear from any 
situation. Children especially need to know that the family has a plan for emergen- 
cies and that they are an important part of the plan. 
A good way to begin your preparedness planning is to create a family fire plan. 
9 
Check your smoke alarms for proper operation annually and change the 
batteries. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2

[] 
Plan escape routes including those from second stories. 
u 
Establish a family meeting point (more on this in the next subsection). 
9 
Call for help once outside. 
9 
Practice your plan until it works flawlessly. 
Spend some time explaining that emergencies can happen anytime, and that if 
we're all home together, we'll be really lucky. In reality, that's not likely to happen 
and family members will probably be separated for a number of hours (or even 
longer) until they can be reunited. Mom and Dad may be at work, or the kids may 
be at school when a major disaster happens. Discuss, now, how best to get together 
following a major emergency. 
Each family member should have assigned tasks and a procedure to follow in the 
event of an emergency situation. This emergency planning begins with how to get 
out of the house in case of a fire or other emergency, and establishing a meeting 
point afterward for all family members. 
The 3Gs rule applies to the home as well as the workplace. If you need to leave 
due to an emergency in your home, "Get Out, Get Away, and Get in touch." 
A key component in your family preparedness plan is to have several meeting 
points for various emergencies. These are locations the family identifies and where 
they agree to meet if separated due to a disaster or other emergency. 
Possible Meeting Points 
Here is a list of possible meeting points for your family following a disaster or emer- 
[] 
A neighbor's home, the family swing set, the mailbox, bus stop, or tree in 
the yard where the family is to meet in case an emergency requires leaving 
the home on short notice 
9 
A community shelter, relative's home, or neighborhood business in case a 
neighborhood requires evacuation 
m 
A relative or friend's home or other location outside the community in 
case the family is separated in a wide-scale disaster 
[] 
A virtual meeting place such as an e-mail address or phone number outside 
the community so family members can check in if separated 
Schools have very specific procedures for early dismissal situations. Releasing 
children to family members is usually an option, but this must be approved before- 
hand. Allowing the school system to transport your children home may be faster 
gency: 

52 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
than you trying to pick them up. Find out what your children's school system poli- 
cies are and discuss these policies with your children. 
If students will be sheltered in-place (kept safe at school) how will they be 
released? Will students be transported to a community shelter? If so, where is that 
shelter located? 
Community Shelter 
Your local emergency management agency has designated certain facilities in your 
city or county as community shelters. These shelters are generally public high 
schools or other public buildings that can hold a large number of people for an 
extended period of time. Typically, the American Red Cross is the agency that man- 
ages these shelters and provides food services, cots, first aid, communications, and 
basic health care for individuals who may need it. Community shelters are a safe 
place to go when needed. In a dangerous situation~such as a tornado, hurricane, or 
other general emergency~many people will try to stay at home. If the order is 
given to evacuate, do not hesitate. Leave immediately and go to a shelter as directed. 
It's important for you and your family to understand what to take and not take 
to a community shelter if you go to one of these facilities.You should bring pillows, 
blankets, toiletry items, prescription medications, games, snacks, and identification. 
Ask your local Red Cross or emergency management agency~before an emer- 
gency~what can and cannot be brought with you to a local shelter. If you're a pet 
owner, ask what arrangements will be in place for pet care. 
~'~'~"~'~J!~ Assemble a personal "evacuation bag" for each member of the family.

Preparedness Pantry 
Every home should maintain a supply of nonperishable food and water for the entire 
family. When asked "how do I buy and store two weeks worth of food?" My 
response is that you simply have to fill your pantry. Most of us never do that. Instead, 
we depend on stopping by the supermarket or carry-out on the way home to pick 
up dinner. Now is the time to change that behavior and it can be done easily (and 
affordably) over a period of several weeks. 
I've mentioned being prepared for at least 72 hours and more realistically two 
weeks, earlier in this chapter. Over the next several trips to the supermarket, pur- 
chase extra cans or packages of the foods you most often use. Supplement these with 
additional canned meats, vegetables, and fruits. Plan and stock your "preparedness 
pantry" to provide a two-week supply of meals. Be realistic: In an emergency situa- 
tion, you won't be entertaining, and in most cases "meals" will be simple and quick. 
Purchase additional items that store well and can be used in a wide variety of meal 
planning~rice, dried beans and pasta are ideal choices. 
Simply add a few more items each time you grocery shop and plan to have your 
"preparedness pantry" completed in three trips. Shop with a list and buy shelf-stable 
items. Once your supply is purchased, date every item and rotate your supply by 
incorporating them into your normal menus. Always plan ahead by purchasing 
replacement items first before using anything from your "preparedness pantry." 
www.syngress.com 

54 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
Once your pantry is stocked, rotate that stock by using the food purchased first 
and then resupplying. I mark each can and package with its purchase date using a 
permanent marker. It's easy to use the first purchased items and then replace on the 
next trip to the supermarket. If you don't keep your preparedness pantry supplied 
with "rotated stock" you may find three-year-old tomato sauce that will add nothing 
but disappointment to your dinner plans. 
I should at this point explain the term "shelf stable." Shelf-stable foods are pre- 
pared to be stored without refrigeration or any other special conditions for extended 
periods of time. Dried fruit and meat was the first "shelf-stable" food civilized man 
discovered. In fact, this food preservation method was used long before kitchens or 
shelves were invented. 
While shelf-stable food purchased at the supermarket will easily last 12 to 18 
months, I recommend a six-month storage/use/replacement routine. By incorpo- 
rating your "emergency pantry" into your normal menus, you'll always have that 
two-week supply ready for use in an emergency. 
Marking each container with the purchase date will help identify the "emer- 
gency pantry" items. Use these long-term storage items in normal weekly menus 
occasionally.You can purchase a replacement before it's actually used if you plan your 
menus a week beforehand. If you don't have a replacement before use, simply tear 
the label off and purchase a replacement on your next shopping trip. 
An exception to this is MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) and dehydrated long-term 
storage foods that have a shelf life of six years and longer (depending on storage 
conditions). It's a good idea, however, to incorporate some of these occasionally into 
your regular meal planning, too, so family members know what these meals look and 
taste like. MREs (regardless of what you may hear) are tasty and nutritious. 
"Soft pack canning" or MRAEs became the military standard in the 1960s. This 
process involves cooking the food in multilayer plastic envelopes that are impervious 
to the chemical action of the food or environment. This soft container maintains an 
airtight and almost indestructible "cocoon" for the fully cooked and "ready to eat 
food."This stuff stores for years and maintains flavor and nutritional benefits. Do not 
buy "military surplus" MREs; buy them fresh from local or online dealers. 
MREs are a great choice for any organization or business that may need to feed 
employees and or family members in an emergency situation. They are packaged in 
complete meal servings. Each meal is unit packed in a plastic envelope that includes 
the entree, side items, drink, dessert, and accessories pack with salt, pepper, eating 
utensils, and napkin. All that is needed is a method for warming the food which, in a 
pinch, can be eaten at room temperature. One envelope contains a complete and 
balanced nutritious meal. This is especially important when mass feeding a large 
group without a large dining or food preparation facility. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
55 
Canned foods will easily store for 12 to 18 months. Some of the new microwave 
entrees are use-dated for generally a year. Look closely on your grocery store shelves 
(not freezer section) and you may be surprised at what you'll find that can be used 
in your emergency pantry. Along with canned vegetables and meats, you'll discover 
fully cooked meals ready to be warmed in the microwave, which include chicken, 
turkey, and beef entrees.You'll also find cooked pasta and rice dishes just waiting to 
be warmed and eaten. 
Canning to preserve food and their flavors has been used for over two hundred 
years and is still the leading food preservation technology. Home canning remains pop- 
ular especially when home gardens are producing more than we can use or give away.

iiiiiiiiiiiii Napoleon offered a cash prize to anyone who could find a way to 
iii~iiiiiiii keep food from spoiling so that he could better feed his army on their 
....... "%i long campaigns. In 1795, Nicolas Appert discovered that by placing 
food in sealed containers and cooking them in boiling water the food 
lasted for long periods of time. He won the prize, and his method of 
food preservation was declared a military secret. It wasn't long, how- 
ever, before this new preservation method found its way to England 
where in 1810 Peter Durrand improved the process by using metal 
containers or "cans." 
Home freezing and frozen foods (TV dinners) became popular in the 1950s. 
Today, refrigeration and freezing are the most popular forms of food preservation. By 
the way, if you have a freezer full of frozen food and no power, don't panic--and 
don't open the freezer door. A full freezer will keep frozen food "frozen" for around 
48 hours/fyou avoid the urge to open the door. 
Freeze-dried foods are very popular with backpackers. These foods are fully 
cooked and then flash frozen at temperatures around-125 degrees Fahrenheit. Water 
from the food is condensed and removed, leaving a dried food product, which is 
then packaged in an airtight (generally plastic/foil) package. All you need to do is 
add the water back, and heat the product when you're ready to eat. 
Freeze-dried foods are very light and compact, and will store for many years. 
Complete freeze-dried meals are available in any outdoor supply or camping store. 
One small drawback is that they are a bit more expensive than hard or soft pack 
canned food items, you must have an ample supply of water to add to the contents, 
and they are not as easy to incorporate in a normal family menu for pantry stores 
rotation.

Irradiated food processing is still fairly new and in very limited distribution in 
the U.S. at the time of this writing. Irradiation offers some major food safety and 
preservation benefits. This technology uses a radioactive source to "sterilize" the food 
without cooking it. So, in theory, meat could be stored in a container without 
refrigeration for weeks and still be safe and favorable. Fruits and vegetables can be 
stored for months without loosing color, flavor, or food value. No radioactivity is 
transferred to the food, so your salad will not mutate into some giant walking green 
thing that chases you around the kitchen. The Food and Drug Administration 
reports that food irradiation is allowed in nearly 40 countries and is endorsed by the 
World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, and many other organi- 
zations. However, the percentage of food being irradiated is still very low due to the 
expense and lack of acceptance of this new process. Stay tuned, this process will be 
commonplace in a few years. 
As you can see, we are blessed with an array of well-proven food preservation 
methods.You must keep a supply on hand and thus avoid the danger of going out to 
look for something to eat. 
Water 
Water is the most important item in your "preparedness pantry." Store one gallon of 
water for each family member for each day you plan to be self-sufficient. Generally 
plan on using a half-gallon of water per day for drinking, and a half-gallon per day 
for sanitation for each family member. Date each container and rotate your stock 
every six months. Most commercial water containers are dated, saving you from 
having to do it yourself. Most commercially bottled water is use-dated for at least a 
year or two. 
I recommend several one-, two-, or five-gallon containers of water for cooking 
and sanitation, and smaller 8- or 12-ounce bottles for drinking and refilling. 
What's the difference between distilled water, spring water, and drinking water? 
Generally, the price. Distilled water is of course distilled or boiled into steam, the 
steam is condensed back into liquid form and bottled. This process removes all of the 
minerals and impurities and in fact sterilizes the water. Spring water should come 
from a spring (no guarantees here) and is probably filtered. 
Drinking water is just "tap water" from a municipal water supply that may or 
may not be filtered and then bottled. Most is filtered, but check the label. Do as you 
please, but I simply buy the cheapest "store brand" drinking water for less than 60 
cents a gallon. 
If you have a natural water source near your home (spring, stream, or lake), con- 
sider purchasing a water purification filter. These filters generally consist of a small 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
57 
hand pump and a high-efficiency carbon or ceramic element that will purify the 
most questionable water supply. Several new water purification products are on the 
market. These include filtering straws and even battery-operated ultra-violet systems. 
For now, these tend to be expensive and produce limited volume. Having access to a 
water source and the proper purification equipment will reduce the amount of 
stored water you may need. 
Storing a supply of food and drinking water is not just for personal or family 
emergency planning. The workplace must be able to support employees who may be 
stranded or "sheltered" in the workplace. Every business continuity plan must address 
the likelihood of supporting employees who may be required to stay put in order to 
keep critical operations running if conditions warrant. 
Cooking 
Simple one-pot "camping" meals are best in an emergency situation.After all, you'll 
be concentrating on other important issues. Be extremely careful in how you prepare 
your meals, especially when operating gas or other open-flame stoves that should be 
used outdoors. Never use charcoal grills or other outdoor cooking "appliances" inside 
your home. Use them outside where they belong. The risk of fire (which is great) is over- 
shadowed by the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. 
For one-pot meal suggestions, look no further than your "crock pot" recipe 
book. Search out recipes that use foods stored in your "preparedness pantry" and 
simply adjust cooking time from s-l-o-w to shorter times with higher heat. 
Other good recipe resources are camping cookbooks and the official Boy Scout 
Field Book. Tke Boy Scouts of America Field Book is one of the best available manuals, 
not only for cooking but for general self-sufficiency as well. 
Try the recipes that look interesting to you and your family. Tailor the ingredi- 
ents to meet your specific tastes and portion requirements. The ones voted most 
enjoyable should be written on recipe cards and kept in your pantry. 
I'm a lazy cook who loves to prepare and eat but hates to clean up. So after years 
of practice, I'm pretty good at whipping up some decent meals with little or no 
clean-up. Heating (see note that follows) foil packed meats, vegetables, and MILEs in 
their packages in a single pot of boiling water allows you to use the water for hot 
drinks, rice, pasta, kitchen clean-up, and/or personal care. Cooking rice or pasta in 
"boiling bags" allows you to avoid more clean-up and requires less water, which may 
be in short supply. Of course, in an emergency, fuel may also be in short supply.

As with any new recipe or cooking technique, it's best to try these first yourself

Testing Your Home Preparedness Plan 
Just like a business continuity plan, a family preparedness plan is not complete until 
it is routinely tested and updated. At work, you and your co-workers must be 
familiar with your employer's business continuity or emergency plan and understand 
your role in that plan. Semi-annual plan reviews and exercises are the best method of 
keeping the plan current and the recovery teams competent in their ability to suc- 
cessfully execute the plan. 
This is true for your family preparedness plan, too. Family members (regardless 
of their age or physical abilities) must actively participate and thoroughly understand 
the purpose of the plan and the importance of their respective roles in making the 
plan work successfully. 
In the business environment, our continuity or preparedness plans are con- 
cerned with the safety of the employees and the welfare of the enterprise. At home, 
our focus is on our loved ones and the survivability of our home and family. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
59 
I strongly suggest you use the same tactics for plan testing or exercising at home 
that you use (or should be using) at work. Tabletop emergency exercises at work can 
become a great rainy day "board game" at home. Plan "what if" and "how can our 
family handle an emergency" discussions, and include everyone's input. Hold a 
"walkthrough" of your plan to see if parts of it are unrealistic. Of course, scheduled 
exercises or even a few unannounced drills are the best method of keeping your 
family preparedness plan the best it can be, and as a result, your family will be safer. 
One of the most enjoyable ways to test your preparedness plans is to have a 
"camp-in." Select a weekend evening and announce that you'll all meet in the living 
room or den and camp out for the night. Off go the lights and the entire family uses 
only the supplies on hand to "survive the disaster." Pretend there is no phone or 
power other than what you can supply with your own resources. Meals should be 
prepared using your "preparedness pantry" and alternate cooking methods. 
We can promise three things if you follow our advice in this chapter.Your family 
will be better prepared for emergencies, you'll all have some fun, and you and your 
family will discover that doing something a bit unusual as a team brings you closer 
together and builds a stronger family bond. 
Family Ready Kit 
Designating a central point where special supplies and basic equipment will be 
stored saves valuable time in responding to an emergency. While there are a few 
"family emergency kits" now being marketed online and in some stores, I suggest 
you make your own.You probably already have many of the things you'll need, and 
by building the kit yourself and involving the entire family, everyone becomes 
familiar with the contents and the location of the kit. 
Younger family members in particular feel more confident if mom and dad 
aren't around by knowing that the family ready kit has basic emergency supplies to 
help them until other family members arrive. 
If the family can stay at home and shelter-in-place, the ready kit is "ready" to 
help the family stay safe and more comfortable. If the emergency requires evacuation 
to a safer location, the kit is easily carried with the family. Following are some sug- 
gested items; adjust as appropriate for your family. Keep your ready kit in a closed 
container and be sure everyone in the family understands its purpose and storage 
location. 
While not part of the regular "family ready kit," don't forget pet food and pet 
medications.Your pets are an important part of the family, too.

No Lights? No Problem! 
Lighting is a source of safety and comfort. Most of the conveniences in our homes 
and the tools in our workplaces are powered with electricity. When the power goes 
off, we suddenly find ourselves in an unfamiliar and sometimes scary environment. 
All the stuff we rely on to make us comfortable, help us do our jobs, and make us 
safe, stops working. 
Let's get this out of the way right now: Candles are for birthday cakes, not emer- 
gency lighting,. In an emergency situation, you'll have a tremendous number of things 
on your mind, stress will be affecting your ability to think clearly, and the fire 
department will probably be busy, so let's not complicate things by adding to what- 
ever disaster you may be dealing with by burning your house down. 
The major difference between candles and other sources of flame-dependent 
lighting is that candles provide little light, usually are not supplied with fire-resistant 
containers, and have an open flame. Coleman lanterns and the old reliable kerosene 
type lamps grandma used at least contain the flame in a fireproof enclosure. This 
enclosure (glass globe or chimney) generally prevents something from accidentally 
coming into contact with the flame and starting a fire. Generally, anything with a 
flame requires great caution when used, and can cause a fire or explosion if 
employed where natural gas pipes may be leaking. 

62 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
Start with the safest form of auxiliary lighting, chemical light sticks, and then 
after making sure there is no danger of explosion (broken gas lines, leaking or dam- 
aged containers of gasoline or other volatile liquids) work into flashlights and bat- 
tery-operated lamps. Pressurized gas camping lanterns are for outdoor use. Kerosene 
and other oil lamps, even the high-efficiency models, require extreme caution if used 
indoors. In an emergency, avoid any device that uses a flame for lighting~especially 
candles. 
In the well-prepared workplace, emergency lighting and power must be provided 
so critical operations can continue and provide a safe and comfortable working envi- 
ronment. At home, these same reasons apply. 
Power outages can be caused by storms, natural disasters, accidents, human error, 
equipment failure, and intentional acts. Blackouts and brownouts caused by a lack of 
generating capacity in some areas of the country are becoming a summer routine. 
Corporations and individuals are searching for ways to avoid the dangers, stress, and 
financial loss associated with power failures. 
Emergency Lighting 
"Where's the flashlight?" is the call of the unprepared when the lights go out. It's so 
simple, but few people know where it is or routinely check to see if the batteries are 
producing power and the bulb works. When you buy batteries, date them with a 
laundry marker, test them every three months, and change them at least once a year. 
By the way, standardize on the type of light--and for goodness sake, the battery size. 
Shopping for batteries will be much easier this way. 
Since we mentioned chemical light sticks first (sometimes referred to as "snap 
lights"), it's only fitting to explain this safe light source first. My favorite is the 
Caylume 30-minute or one-hour high intensity white light stick. These six-inch 
long plastic tubes contain two nontoxic chemical agents that, when mixed, fluoresce 
with a bright white light.You simply bend the plastic tube at a sharp angle, which 
breaks (snaps) an inner capsule that starts the chemical process. Shaking the stick a 
couple of times completes the mixing process, and suddenly you have plenty of light 
to work with. There is no danger of heat, flame, fire, or explosion. These lights can 
be used safely in any environment, and they have a shelf life of approximately three 
years. 
Light sticks can be purchased in a variety of colors and sizes. Buy high inten- 
sity where possible since these produce enough light to work and read by and will 
emit usable light for nearly an hour. The sticks will continue to glow for many 
hours, so they can be used to mark stairways, doors, or other locations. These light 
sticks have equal value as escape lights in both the workplace and home. They are 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
63 
a great source of comfort for children since they can be safely carried around, or 
even brought to bed. 
Battery-operated lights, flashlights, and lanterns are the most common source of 
emergency lighting for most families. 
While there are many flashlights and battery-operated lanterns on the market 
today, I want to discuss the four main categories of battery-operated lights. 
ARNING 
~J 
N!i~: 
If you have gas appliances in your home, be extremely careful after 
any event (hurricane, tornado, or earthquake) that causes structural 
damage. Always check for gas leaks before switching on flashlights or 
anything else that may cause a spark resulting in an explosion. 
Handheld Lights 
These include the regular two-cell (three-cell, four-cell, and counting) flashlights. 
Types and prices run from as cheap as a dollar to several hundred dollars (no kid- 
ding). Avoid the cheap ones as they will break easily and the switching mechanism 
my not work more than a few times. Maglites are at the top of the scale in value. 
They are manufactured with aircraft aluminum, are water-resistant, come in many 
colors and battery-cell sizes, and contain a spare bulb. Several companies manufacture 
top of the line, expensive tactical flashlights designed for a military market that needs 
high intensity, indestructible combat-proven specialty lights. While these lights are 
bright, small, and indestructible, they are very expensive ($100.00 plus) and are 
designed more for target illumination than work area and general illumination. 
A new family of flashlights has appeared on the market in the past several years 
and these lights use no batteries or bulbs. They are marketed as "everlasting" since 
there's nothing to replace. They produce power when the user shakes the light, 
which causes a magnet to slide back and forth through a coil of wire (generator), 
which charges an onboard capacitor, which then powers an LED (light-emitting 
diode). All of this is wrapped in a sealed water-tight plastic housing. These lights can 
be stored for many years, and when needed can be "charged" and used. A half 
minute of shaking will produce approximately 20 minutes of light. 
Several models of"dynamo flashlights" are now available. These lights use a small 
hand-cranked dynamo to charge a battery to power the LEDs. Several models are 
available, including a camping lantern style.

Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
When you purchase a flashlight, headlamp, battery lamp or spotlight, always buy 
extra bulbs and batteries (the exception of course being the LED models mentioned 
earlier, which last forever~almost). Remember to label the batteries with the pur- 
chase date.Yes, if you're using rechargeable batteries, you still need to date them 
since a two-year service life is average. After two years, rechargeable cells of all types 
become somewhat unreliable. OK, so you've had a set working for four years with 
no problems. I'm talking average commercial expectancy in critical situations. 
i TE 
iiii~i LED technology is advancing at a rapid rate, and soon filament-type 
iiii~i incandescent bulbs will be completely replaced in the majority of Iow- 
iiiii{iiiiiiiii voltage lighting applications. The major benefit is that less power is 
needed for an equivalent amount of light output, so fewer batteries 
and longer operation times result. Since these LEDs are solid-state 
devices, they aren't susceptible to filament breakage and burnout. 
Have you noticed that many commercial vehicles now use LEDs for 
brake and marker lights? Most new traffic lights now use LEDs instead 
of "bulbs." 
Maglite and other manufacturers are marketing conversion kits to replace stan- 
dard filament bulbs with LED modules. Generally, these aren't cheap. Nevertheless, 
they're worth the expense in my opinion due to the "lifetime" of service expected 
and the reduced battery replacement.You'll be impressed with the higher light levels 
produced by LEDs. In fact, the Maglite LED conversion kit for a two-cell Maglite 
appears to be brighter than the original standard bulb. 
Headlamps 
Headlamps (my personal favorite) can be worn on your head, leaving both hands 
free. The new ultra-light weight headlamps using LEDs are fantastic. They are small, 
lightweight, and produce good usable work light for any situation. The bonus, of 
course, is that these allow you to use your hands for something other than shining a 
light on your work. They work well for hiking, camping, or any other outdoor 
activity. Many search and rescue teams are converting to these lights. By the way, 
three AAA batteries will power an LED headlamp for 72 hours of continuous use. 
A variety of larger headlamps are also available on the market. Some of these 
resemble miner lights, with various sizes of lamp heads, and many have external bat- 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
65 
tery packs. They are, of course, heavier and tend to be more complicated to wear and 
maintain. 
General Illumination Lamps 
Illumination lamps are used to light a room or specific area. Battery-operated flores- 
cent lanterns or "pop-up" flashlights are the most popular. Many styles exist and 
some florescent lanterns are rechargeable. These offer good illumination for a room 
and usually have an option switch to choose between a "bright" setting (both flores- 
cent tubes on) for reading and critical work, and a "normal" position (one tube on) 
for navigating around the room and conserving battery power. 
"Pop-up" flashlights are a terrific blending of a hand-carried flashlight (usually 
with a lanyard) and a general light source or "tent light" with frosted window that 
distributes light in a 360-degree manner. To convert from flashlight to "tent" or table 
light, simply pull on the front reflector, which exposes the frosted window. The front 
reflector serves as a base that stabilizes the light. These will illuminate a small room 
or your home office with enough light that you can move around safely. They gen- 
erally use four AA batteries and produce between five to seven hours of light. 
A useful hybrid light is the "Syclone" made by Streamlight Inc. This small hand 
light has a tilting head and flat base that provides a good stable work light that can sit 
on a desk or work surface. The light has a dual position switch that selects either a 
regular tungsten bulb or an LED. The four AA batteries will power the LED continu- 
ously for 72 hours. This light has a high-impact plastic case, a rubber handgrip, and 
belt clip, and is supplied with a helmet bracket for fire/rescue or construction use. A 
bonus feature is that this light is rated for use in explosive atmospheres (this is impor- 
tant when around gasoline, natural gas leaks, or other hazardous environments). 
Coleman-type camping lanterns (pressurized gasoline), butane or propane 
lanterns, kerosene table lamps, barn lanterns, and railroad lamps use combustible 
fuels. These light sources require extreme care in use. Even if you are familiar with 
the operation and maintenance of these lamps and lanterns, if they are accidentally 
knocked over, they can and probably will start a fire. Be careful, and never attempt to 
use or fuel a pressurized gas lantern inside your home. Flame-dependant lighting is 
strictly prohibited in commercial structures.You should have the same rule in your 
home as well. 
Spots and Floodlights 
Spots and floodlights are usually 6- or 12-volt lights used by fire departments, rail- 
roads, and utility crews. They tend to be heavy but very bright, and the batteries are 
long lasting. Some smaller versions of these "professional" lights are now showing up 
www.syngress.com 

66 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
in the retail market. One of the best in the "professional" league is manufactured by 
Streamlight and sold by police/fire supply companies and larger hardware and out- 
door outlets. The Streamlight power fail model comes with a 110-volt charger base 
and a 12-volt DC mobile charger base. When using the 110-volt AC charger base, if 
the power goes off, the light comes on. These lights are an excellent choice for the 
workplace as power fail lights in critical areas. Plus, you can remove the light from 
the charger base and carry it with you.You have three lamp options, flood, spot, and 
a fairly new flood/spot combination model. They cost around $100, but if you need 
a tough dependable light, look no further. 
Emergency Power 
The subject of emergency power could itself fill an entire book. We'll spend a bit of 
time on portable electric generators because they are an emergency supply item that 
remains in high demand. As with any mechanical equipment, you must exercise 
good safety habits and understand the equipment, as well as potential risks from 
improper operation. 
Whether your needs for a generator are of the "homeowners" variety with a 
capacity of one to five thousand watts, or a backup power plant with several million 
watts of capacity, some common decisions must be made before you go shopping. 
They are (1) What size do I need and what can I afford? (2) Will this be a portable 
or installed generator? (3) What fuel type do I plan to use? and (4) How can I get 
the emergency power to the devices I plan to operate? 
All portable and backup generators have an engine, which requires fuel. This fuel 
can be gasoline, propane, natural gas, or diesel fuel. The vast majority of smaller gen- 
erators are gasoline powered, but propane and diesel are becoming more popular. 
The alternative "non-gasoline" fuels are safer to store, handle, and in the case of 
propane and natural gas, are cleaner burning. 
: 
... ~ 
ARNING 
Never use a generator indoors, no matter how small it is. When using 
a generator outside of your home or office, be absolutely sure it is sit- 
ting well away from air intakes and any doors or windows that have 
been opened to permit the use of drop-cords or cables. Carbon 
monoxide, an invisible, odorless, and toxic gas, can seep indoors and 
cause illness or even death. Never operate a generator or other gas- 
powered engine under your home, in the basement, or in your 
garage. Carbon monoxide can easily fill an enclosed area. You'll nod 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
67 
off to sleep and very possibly die if carbon monoxide seeps into your 
home. Put generators outside! 
The electrical output of most portable generators runs anywhere from 300 to 
15,000 watts for generators sold through home improvement and hardware stores. 
Prices range from around $500 to a couple of thousand. 
A relatively new entry in the portable generator market is the "inverter gener- 
ator."These units combine the functionality of a portable generator and the "clean 
power" output of a UPS best. These hybrids generate AC voltage, which is then con- 
verted to DC, and then reconverted back into AC voltage by an onboard voltage 
inverter. The inverter generator is an excellent choice when using power-sensitive 
electronics such as servers, switches, routers, and communications equipment. 
Regardless of the size or type of generator you purchase, always read the instruc- 
tion manual and follow the manufacturer's operation recommendations. This includes 
grounding the generator before starting. This is probably one of the most overlooked 
safety steps by homeowners. Also protect the generator from flood water, rain, or 
other environmental hazards. Read the instruction manual. 
Large commercial generators that can power an entire office complex or indus- 
trial operation, operate on the same basic principle as their smaller cousins (an 
engine turns an alternator to make electricity), but of course cost much more and 
require special engineering, installation, and maintenance. These larger generator 
installations generally use diesel fuel. Permanently installed generators for homes and 
small-to-medium businesses tend to use natural gas for simplicity of fuel 
delivery/storage issues. Prices including installation start around $4,000 for a home 
version up to many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a backup power plant with 
multiple generators and related equipment for commercial applications. 
How much emergency power do you need? The simplest method is to use one 
of the many power sizing charts available online or at retail outlets. A portable gen- 
erator in the range of 3,500 to 5,000 watts is a good fit for most homeowners to 
keep things running. 
If you require a generator above 10,000 watts, will it be permanently installed or 
transportable? This certainly has a bearing on fuel type and the connection to your 
"load" (stuff to be powered). One of the most overlooked issues for generators (large 
or small) is how to get the electricity to the devices you want to power. In other 
words, where do you plug it in? 
You have only two choices. First, and by far the best option, is an automatic or 
manual transfer switch. This device disconnects commercial power and easily (and 
www.syngress.com 

68 
Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
safely) connects your "load" (home, office, or manufacturing facility) to the gener- 
ator. Automatic switches sense when commercial power has stopped, starts the gen- 
erator, and then switches the load to the generator. A manual switch requires human 
intervention to start the generator and then flip the switch to begin using the power. 
As you might expect, the automatic switches are expensive but worth the investment 
if power failure is not an option. All permanently installed generators require a 
transfer switch. Some small manual transfer switches are designed for residential use, 
allowing a single connection between the generator and the breaker panel. These 
cost a few hundred dollars and allow you to choose the area of the home to power 
while safely disconnecting from the commercial power supply.

The second option (and most used) is to utilize individual power cables or drop 
cords connected between the generator and your equipment or appliances. For 
smaller generators and home use for powering only a few items, the drop-cord solu- 
tion is fine.

UPS and Battery Backup 
An excellent way to keep critical equipment running during commercial power fail- 
ures is a UPS power supply. These devices operate much like the automatic transfer 
switch and generator combination mentioned earlier except that they have no 
moving parts and are thus safe and simple to operate for indoor and home use.You'll 
probably find some of these near PCs and servers at the office. 
The LIPS contains one or more batteries that are kept charged by an onboard 
charging circuit that uses normal commercial power and an inverter to produce 110 
volts of AC from battery power. A power sensing circuit monitors the commercial 
power source for quality and consistency. If the unit detects a low-/no power or 
high-voltage condition, (in the blink on an eye) it disconnects commercial power 
and supplies electricity to any equipment plugged into its outlets. These devices also 
filter the commercial power source and remove voltage spikes and ripples, which can 
damage sensitive equipment. They are available in various sizes depending on how 
much current you need and the length of time you want to operate the protected 
equipment when the commercial power goes away. 
With a large UPS, the main consideration is how much time you need, want, or 
can afford before the batteries run out of power and no longer provide sufficient 
current to power the inverters. Most large commercial installations provide enough 
battery capacity to allow a generator sufficient time to start and rev up to operating 
speed to supply enough power to begin charging the batteries once again. 
Portable 12-Volt Inverters 
A reliable source of emergency power is sitting right out in your driveway.Your 
automobile and its 12-volt DC power system can provide plenty of power for 
charging cellular phones (you probably have a cigarette lighter adapter or "12-volt 
power cord" now anyway) and for producing limited (a couple of hundred watts) 
amounts of AC power with a DC inverter. As mentioned earlier, an inverter converts 
DC current into AC for the operation of lights, laptops, battery charging, and small 
power tools (this does not include hair dryers or toaster ovens). The inverters simply 
plug into the cigarette lighter socket of your automobile and provide a clean and 
quite safe source of voltage. They, however, cannot operate continuously and must be 
used intermittently. Larger inverters are available but require direct connection to the 
vehicle battery, 
Solid-state inverter generators are marketed as "generators" but are in fact a large 
12-volt battery or array of batteries, a DC inverter, and a container with 12-volt DC 
and 110 AC outlets. The smaller units work well for limited power use and for jump 
starting your vehicle if needed. Since there are no moving parts, they are quiet and

Chapter 2 9 Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 
can be safely used indoors. They can be recharged from a 12-volt DC power source 
or the supplied battery charger. These inverters are available in a number of sizes and 
weights (the batteries are heavy) from around 20 pounds up to several hundred 
pounds. 
Larger permanently installed inverters can power an entire small business or 
home for extended periods of time. Many homeowners living in remote locations 
depend on large inverters with a battery array to supply AC voltage for some of 
their power needs. The batteries can be charged using one of the alternative power 
sources mentioned in the next section. 
Alternative Power Sources 
Wind, running water, and thermal and solar energy are all "alternative power" 
sources. While these may appear to be out of the financial reach of most homes and 
businesses, portable solar panels that can recharge cellular phones and laptops are 
becoming mainstream and affordable. As we move deeper into the twenty-first cen- 
tury, the "alternative" sources that become cost effective and dependable will find 
market share quickly. Portable solar cells in neat fold-up cases are available for $60 to 
$100 in many electronics and "road warrior" catalogs. Expect a good one to charge 
your cellular phone in several hours of bright sunlight. Larger "portable panels" can 
provide the power to charge and maintain satellite phones and other equipment 
requiring more current. Large solar panels for providing heat and electricity for 
homes is commonplace in many areas of the country, and these panels capable of 
supplying the needs of an entire home have dropped in price while gaining effi- 
ciency and market share. Solar-powered street lights, web cams, and traffic signs, 
while expensive, have an attractive return on investment. 
Fuel cells are now finding their way into more common use. As environmental 
pressure increases, these "chemical generators" will become more cost-effective. 
While the technology is exciting, so is the cost. For the present, this technology is 
out of the reach of most individuals and companies for routine use. 
Staying in Touch 
I cannot overstate the importance of communications and how critical staying in 
touch will be for you and your family in a disaster or other crisis situation. (Under 
normal conditions, that's easy now since everyone has a cellular phone and "on-hip" 
Internet access and e-mail.) However, when the lights go out along with the infras- 
tructure we depend on to make our normal communications effortless, we must 
have a "plan B." 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2

Remember when there was no Internet? Close your eyes for a moment and pre- 
tend we've been transported back to a time when there is no e-mail and no 
browsing the World Wide Web for information and current updates on breaking 
news. There is no cellular service, no voice mail, fax, and no easy and reliable tele- 
phone service for that matter. It's a bit hard to imagine, isn't it? Really, it wasn't that 
long ago (about 50 years) that basic telephone service was considered a rare com- 
modity. Even 15 years ago, the Internet was something that most people believed 
involved fishing. 
Fifteen years ago, cellular phones were the size of bricks, service was limited to 
metropolitan areas, and the phones were used by the very few and the well-to-do. 
Think back to those times and try to imagine how you would stay in touch 
with your family, customers, and the office.Your little investment in a daydream may 
pay big dividends in your future, for as soon as tomorrow, next week, or next 
month, we may be left without some, or most, of our modern communications 
infrastructure. 
As a society, we are so dependant on our communications infrastructure that it 
makes a tempting (and sometimes very soft) target for those who would do our 
way-of-life harm. Turn off communications and you can no longer visit an ATM 
machine to withdraw cash. Businesses can't receive or fill orders; our transportation, 
finance, utilities, and even law enforcement depend on reliable and uninterruptible 
communications links to conduct normal operations. 
Our communications infrastructure is designed for routine network capacity 
and normal traffic patterns. An event that destroys infrastructure and disrupts these 
"normal patterns" can overload surviving infrastructure and cause failures in com- 
munications networks. A "fast busy signal" is the first sign of trouble. How can you 
stay in touch when our normal communications services and systems fail or are 
taken away? 
The first and most important radio you can own is a "SAME" all hazards alert 
radio. SAME is an acronym for "Specific Area Message Encoding." It naturally is a 
U.S. government term, but we can overlook that because the technology and system 
are so important. These radios, which can be purchased at any home electronics store 
or from numerous sources online, alert you to impending dangerous weather or 
other life-threatening incidents in your community. These include tornadoes, hurri- 
canes, hazardous materials incidents, terrorism, and other civil emergencies. 
The SAME alert radio has an audio alert tone, an alphanumeric display, and a 
speaker so you can receive audio information from your local NOAA (National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) office.Yes, this alerting service is provided 
by the National Weather Service but this is not just your old reliable weather fore- 
cast. NOAA has partnered with local, state, and national emergency management

agencies and the Office of Homeland Security to provide emergency information 
for an), emergency situation. 
After purchasing, you simply program the SAME receiver with your commu- 
nity's unique alert code. Every city, county, and community has a unique code. 
When an emergency alert or warning is issued for your community, an alert tone 
sounds and the receiver's audio is turned on to inform you of what action is neces- 
sary. The alerts provided are official information, not someone's opinion based on 
second- or thirdhand reports. 
Now, I'm sure you may be thinking that with CNN and the Internet, why 
bother? Unless you sleep with one eye on CNN or have someone at home or work 
monitoring local emergency response agencies around the clock, you need this 
radio. While CNN and other media reports are usually accurate, they are not "offi- 
cial" sources of information. The SAME all hazards radio is. 
Several ideas and programs are in the works for an improved national alerting 
network, but for now the SAME radio is a dependable solution for quickly alerting 
the population of dangers at any time of the day or night. I urge you to purchase 
one for your home and workplace. Does your school have one of these? If not, make 
sure they do very soon. Cost varies from $30 to around $80. Most radios include a 
battery so the radio continues to work even if the power is off. By the way, once you 
purchase the radio, there is no monthly charge for this vital service 
.,~,;~,~,~J'~ The SAME alert radio is as important to your safety as your smoke 
alarm, and just like your smoke alarm, it may save your life.

Dynamo Radios 
Dynamo (emergency) radios are now marketed in numerous places and come in a 
variety of colors, including camouflage. I don't have a clue why, but they do look 
cool. They cover the AM, FM, shortwave, and/or weather bands. Most include a 
small light for finding your way, and some include an outlet for charging your cell 
phone. 
An onboard dynamo or "generator" produces power by turning a small crank. 
This action produces direct current which charges an internal battery supplying 
power to the radio.You can store this radio for years and "crank it up" when you 
need it. 

Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness 9 Chapter 2 
73 
FRS Radios 
FRS is yet another acronym, this one for "Family Radio Service." These two-way 
radios are the inexpensive pairs of"walkie-talkies" advertised in most of the sporting 
goods and electronics stores. They allow license-free family communication over dis- 
tances of a half mile or so. They are extremely valuable for emergency communica- 
tions in and around the neighborhood when nothing else works. 
Ham Radio 
When disaster strikes, ham (amateur) radio operators provide invaluable communica- 
tions services to local, state, and federal authorities, the military, and the general 
public. These volunteer operators provide their own equipment, training, and elec- 
trical power to keep emergency information flowing when other communications 
facilities are out of service. It's their hobby, and they do this important service for free. 
If you know a ham radio operator in your community, ask about his or her 
ability to get messages into and out of disaster areas. One day you may have need to 
get information about a loved one or family member in a disaster area, or you may 
need to send word that "we're OK." And while you're at it, you may just discover 
that you have an interest in getting involved in this fascinating hobby. 
The "POTS" Line 
We have access to so many cool communications technologies today that it's 
astounding. VolP (Voice over Internet Protocol), personal satellite phones that fit 
into a coat pocket, cellular, and cordless phones with range that allows us to carry 
them with us when we visit neighbors. Remember that if the power goes off, so do 
most of our communications. While many cordless phones in our homes have 
backup batteries, the majority do not. However, the "Plain Old Telephone System" 
(POTS) operates on DC voltage supplied by the telephone company central office. 
Having a simple "plain old telephone" to plug in and use during these times will 
allow you to stay in touch.

In this chapter, we've covered a great deal of information related to your prepared- 
ness at work and at home for unexpected emergencies and disasters. If there is one 
single rule to remember, it is that all of us must be prepared mentally, physically, and 
emotionally for the next catastrophic event that may disrupt not only our lives, but 
also the lives of our family, friends, and coworkers. Having a plan, basic supplies, and 
the knowledge that we can and will get through it together will make us all stronger 
as individuals and as a nation.

Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
Introduction 
Computers and digital devices are employed by the majority of people in the U.S. 
for myriad business and personal uses. Because of the wide acceptance of computers 
in our daily lives, it is reasonable to conclude that people will use a computer to 
assist them in the commission of crimes, record aspects of crimes on a computer, and 
use computers to store the fruits of their crimes or contraband. 
Any of the computers involved in the situations just discussed will likely con- 
tain upwards of hundreds of thousands of pieces of information stored in a digital 
format, including operating system files, program files, user documents, and file 
fragments in drive free space. While the challenge for the laboratory examiner is to 
find the relevant data objects on a hard drive or other media, a greater challenge 
exists for the on-scene responders and investigators: How can the information be 
collected from the scene and brought to a location where it can be examined? 
Does all the hardware on-scene need to be seized as evidence, or will an exact copy 
of the information serve the purposes of an investigation? Are there other seizure 
options to be considered? 
Continued 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3

What we consider to be evidence has a dramatic effect on how we view the 
electronic crime scene. The current model of digital evidence seizure is focused on 
physical hardware, which is appropriate in most situations. However, as we move for- 
ward from this point in time, factors such as the size of media and full-disk encryp- 
tion will impact the ability to seize all the hardware on-scene for later analysis at a 
forensics laboratory. Other options besides wholesale hardware seizure~RAM 
recovery, on-scene imaging of hard drives, and imaging of select files~need to 
become part of the basic toolkit of on-scene responders. 
But the acceptance of other options for digital evidence seizure will not be a 
spontaneous event. The legal framework, the established workflows of existing com- 
puter forensic best practices, and the fear of the unknown will all play a part in 
determining how quickly the digital evidence seizure methodologies are adjusted to 
accept other options besides wholesale hardware seizure. The community of people 
that respond to, investigate, and prosecute crimes that have a digital evidence com- 
ponent is a very diverse population with different frames of reference and different 
technical understanding. If one group decides to unilaterally implement a change in 
practices or policy, the ripple effect is felt across the entire system~which is what 
makes bridg, ing, the 2aps such an important part of considering and implementing any 
change resulting from advances in technology. As the author and a member of the 
greater crime-with-a-cyber-component-community, I hope this work serves to 
create discussion between the disparate communities on the appropriateness of both 
the familiar and innovative methods to seize digital evidence. 
To these ends, I have organized the following pages to guide the reader through 
a number of topics relating to both the existing method of digital seizure and the 
innovative options available for on-scene responders. First, we will examine some of 
the framework surrounding the legal view of evidence, then we will address how the 
current digital evidence seizure methodology evolved, and afterward we'll take a 
look at each of the seizure steps individually. This work is not intended to be a step- 
by-step guide for digital evidence seizure, but many of the current best practices are 
examined, and some common pitfalls are discussed. Following the discussion of the 
www.syngress.com 

78 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
current method of seizure, we will explore some of the reasons why the wholesale 
seizure of hardware on-scene may become problematic in the future. Finally, we will 
discuss a number of options available for seizure of information, including the on- 
scene preview of information, the seizure of data held in the computer's RAM, on- 
scene imaging of entire hard drives, and the on-scene imaging of specific data 
objects.

In the sections that follow, we will primarily be discussing criminal 
~ 
procedures, as I would hope that the civil procedures would follow 
the guidelines set forth by the criminal side of the house. Many civil 
procedures often turn into criminal events, and vice versa, so it's prob- 
ably wise to be working each case as if it were destined for criminal 
court. Further, most of my work has been as a bridge between the 
technical community and that of law enforcement~and it is from this 
viewpoint that the chapter is written. 
Obviously, criminals may actually steal a computer or other device 
directly~but the focus of this chapter is not on the physical theft of 
hardware. Instead, we target how information held within the 
storage medium can be processed into evidence. 
Here, I wili colloquially refer to computers and hard drives when 
discussing digital information. I do realize many types of digital 
devices and media contain data, but it is often too cumbersome to 
individually point out each item or specify each situation. 
This chapter focuses more specifically on the seizure of digital evi- 
dence when that evidence relates to a static event, such as receiving a 
harassing e-mail or seizing a computer that contains child pornog- 
raphy. An analysis and discussion of recovering information and evi- 
dence from a more dynamic event, such as a Denial-of-Service attack 
or a network intrusion are covered in Chapter 5 of Cyber Crime 
Investigations: Bridging the Gaps between Security Professionals, Law 
Enforcement, and Prosecutors (Syngress Publishing, 2007). Although 
much of what is discussed in the following sections still apply to net- 
work forensics, please note that I am purposely minimizing the points 
that apply to it. 
Finally, i am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. The intent of 
this chapter is to provide investigators, prosecutors and private sector 
personnel with options and discussion topics related to the collection 
of digital evidence. Any conclusions or recommendations in this 
chapter that may resemble legal advice should be vetted through

legal counsel. Always check with your local jurisdiction, local prose- 
cutors, and local forensics laboratory as to their preferred 
method(s) of digital evidence collection. 
Defining Digital Evidence 
Black's Law Dictionar),~the Bible for legal definitions~provides several definitions 
for evidence (Nolan, 1990). One of the definitions reads "Testimony, writings, or 
material objects offered in proof of an alleged fact or proposition." I have to say it is 
rather refreshing to have a generally straightforward and concise legal definition; 
generally, I don't equate straightforward and concise with legal...well.., anything. 
The definition does provide a good launching point for our discussions on how dig- 
ital information is viewed in the criminal justice system. 
Black's definition of evidence as applied to digital evidence can be viewed in two 
ways. First, we can examine the computer itself as the evidence. This is clearly the 
case when the computer is the actual instrument of the crime, such as when the 
physical parts of the computer are used to commit a crime~for example, I hit you 
over the head with a keyboard. Colloquially, most law enforcement investigators and 
prosecutors will call the computer itself evidence even in cases where information 
on the computer relates to a given crime.As one investigator told me: "Everything 
seized at a crime scene is evidence until someone tells me it's not." In this sense, 
when the computer itself is seized at a crime scene or through a warrant, it is con- 
sidered by many to be evidence. 
Building on the view of the computer as evidence, many assert that the informa- 
tion on the computer requires the original computer to view the contents. In other 
words, the original computer~along the lines of how the best evidence rule 
requires the "original" whenever possible~may have an impact on how the infor- 
mation on the computer was actually viewed by the suspect. This is a valid view- 
point because many forensic software packages will not provide a view that is exactly 
as the suspect would have seen it. Too many different programs may show a given 
file, image, movie, or e-mail in a particular manner. The computer forensic analysis 
programs will often use a generic viewer capable of displaying any number of dif- 
ferent formats. For example, Access Data's FTK has a generic format in which all e- 
mails would be displayed regardless of the program in which they were created. The 
generic format provides all the same information that would have been shown in the 
original e-mail, but it clearly is shown in a very different format than what the sus- 
www.syngress.com 

80 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
pect would have seen.An e-mail viewed through the AOL e-mail program will 
include all the banners, advertisements, and formatting that make up the AOL look 
and feel of the user's experience. The e-mail itself will contain a number of standard 
fields, such as the e-mail header and the body of the message. The AOL program 
places these fields in a particular "package?' However, that same e-mail viewed in 
FTK, though containing the same content, would lack the AOL packaging. In court, 
the examiner may be asked "Is this exactly what the suspect saw?" and the obvious 
answer is "No--but..." And it is within this "but..." that the court may suggest that 
the evidence--the complete computer and information as a unified package--be 
brought forth in front of the court. 
A second way to view Black's definition is that the information, or data objects, 
contained on the digital storage medium are the "testimony, writings, or material 
objects" offered in proof of an alleged fact. This viewpoint makes the computer 
nothing more than a device that is used to access the information, and the compo- 
nents of the computer that store digital information nothing more than mere phys- 
ical containers that house information--similar to a file cabinet or briefcase. 
Arguments can be made that only the desired information can be seized as evidence. 
The ramifications of this change in focus from hardware-as-evidence to informa- 
tion-as-evidence are far reaching. 
If we do propose there is a distinction between the data objects and the physical 
container, we need to examine the legal framework within which we operate and 
seize information to determine if it is permissible to seize either the physical hard- 
ware or the information, or both. Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure (FRCP), titled "Search and Seizure" provides a definition for property, 
stating that "'Property' includes documents, books, papers, any other tangible objects, 
and information" (FR.CP, Rule 41(a)(2)(A)). Within this definition is our first incli- 
nation that, in fact, the legal system views both storage containers and information as 
property. When we move forward in the FRCP into the discussions on seizure, we 
see that persons or property are subject to search or seizure and that a warrant may 
be issued for any of the following: (1) evidence of a crime; (2) contraband, fruits of 
crime, or other items illegally possessed; (3) property designed for use, intended for 
use, or used in committing a crime; or (4) a person to be arrested, or a person who 
is unlawfully restrained (FR.CP, Rule 41 [c]).

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
81 
of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) provides the guidance for bringing an 
accused through the process of arrest and trial. The Computer Crime 
and Intellectual Property Section within the Criminal Division of the 
United States Department of Justice publishes a document titled 
Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in 
Criminal Investigations (Manual). The Manual provides a very thor- 
ough review of a number of issues related to working with digital evi- 
dence~particularly as it relates to federal case law. Obviously, the 
depth of the information contained in the FRE, FRCP, and the Manual 
is well beyond the scope of this chapter, but I recommend that anyone 
interested in this field become familiar with these documents. Absent 
from the following discussions is talk of state law. Although many 
states will retain the ability for their own courts to be the "final say" 
regarding procedural or evidentiary matters, many states have 
adopted rules very similar to the FRE and FRCP. 
Of interest to our discussion here is that property includes information, and that 
search and seizure is authorized, with a warrant, for property that is evidence of a 
crime. The next logical conclusion being that warrants can be issued for information 
that is evidence of a crime~but do the courts interpret using specific files or data 
objects as evidence, or should the focus be on the physical storage devices? Here, we 
consult the United States Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual 
Property Section's document titled Searching and Seizin 2 Computers and Obtaining 
Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations (Manual): 
"The most important decision agents must make when 
describing the property in the warrant is whether the sizable 
property according to Rule 41 is the computer hardware itself, or 
merely the information that the hardware contains (pg. 61) .... if 
the probable cause relates in whole or in part to information 
stored on the computer, the warrant should focus on the content 
of the relevant files rather than on the storage devices which 
may happen to contain them." The Manual references United 
States v. Gawrysiak (972 F. Supp. 853, 860 [D.N.J. 1997], aff'd, 178 
F.3d 1281 [3d Cir. 1999]) which upheld the seizure of "...records 
[that] include information and/or data stored in the form of 
magnetic or electronic coding on computer media ... which con- 
stitute evidence" of enumerated federal crimes (Manual, pg. 62). 
...The physical equipment merely stores the information that the 
agents have probable cause to seize. Although the agents may 
www.syngress.com 

82 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
need to seize the equipment in order to obtain the files it con- 
tains and computer files do not exist separate from some storage 
medium, the better practice is to describe the information rather 
than the equipment in the warrant itself (pg. 65)..." 
The guidance from the Manual is that the Rules on Criminal Procedure, and 
the interpretation of the same in the courts, points to the difference between the 
information held in data objects and the physical container (hard drive, flash media) 
in/on which the data resides. This provides some positive reinforcement to those that 
make the claim that the data itself is the evidence and that the computer or storage 
device is merely a vessel. 
The preceding discussions regarding the computer as the evidence versus the data as the 
evidence has a dramatic effect on how we "seize" or "collect" evidence both at the scene and in 
the forensics laboratory. If your viewpoint is that the computer is the evidence, then 
your seizure methodology will be focused on the collection of the computer itself at 
the scene of the crime. If your viewpoint is that the information is the evidence, 
then you may be more inclined to attempt to locate and retrieve the information-as- 
evidence, with less care as to the eventual fate of the hardware. Further, you may be 
more inclined to call your "computer forensic" efforts simple "evidence collection" 
and remove the requirement for expert classification at trial. The important point 
here is that there are options to be considered, examined, and discussed within the 
community~options that have the ability to significantly change the entire approach 
to computer seizure and analysis. 
Digital Evidence Seizure Methodology 
The proliferation of personal computers changed how computers were involved in 
criminal issues. In the past, computers were often used primarily as the attack plat- 
form or target of the attack~now the more personal use of computes creates a situ- 
ation where the computer is the storehouse of" evidence relating to almost every type 
of crime imaginable. The result is that more computers are involved in some manner 
in crime and that more computers need to be examined for information of eviden- 
tiary value. But before they can be examined, they must be seized. 
Previously, the highly trained computer specialist would attend to each seizure 
personally; however, the proliferation of computers and their use in criminal 
endeavors made personal attention to each case impractical. In some areas of the 
country, one specialist may serve an entire region. It is clearly unreasonable to 
believe that one specialist will be able to perform each seizure and complete the 
examination of the digital evidence for every crime with a cyber component. To fill 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
83 
this apparent gap in need versus capability, state and local law enforcement agents 
have become involved in recovering digital evidence from a crime scene where a 
computer is directly involved. Not only are state and local investigators faced with 
dealing with a new type of crime, but they are also asked to perform the seizures of 
digital evidence. 
The on-scene responders/investigators often know very little about computers 
and often have not been instructed on how to "properly" seize digital information. 
Existing seizure protocols for physical items are used, resulting in a focus on the 
seizure of the computer hardware~sometimes the entire computer, including the 
monitor, printers, keyboard, and so on are seized and packaged for delivery to the 
lab. Over time, it became accepted to use the seizure methods focused on the seizure 
of the physical hardware for the seizure of digital information. Let's take a look at the 
flow of a general seizure of a personal computer.

(Carrier, 2003). Generally, these models present a complete framework 
for digital investigations, from incident response preparation right 
through to the examination and analysis of the seized information. 
Although this holistic viewpoint may be relevant to the administrator 
responsible for the entire operation, these models hold less applica- 
bility to the actual on-scene seizure of the relevant information, which 
is the focus of this chapter. 
The current manner of seizure of computer hardware expects that the on-scene 
responder has a general knowledge about computers~to the level of"THIS is a 
keyboard, THIS is a mouse, THERE is no 'any' key," and so on. Better yet, the 
responder should have basic training on digital evidence collection, or, at the very 
minimum, be able to consult a guide on best practices, such as the USSS Best 
Practices Guide (USSS, 2006) or the Nil First Responder's Guide (NIJ, 2001). Next, the 
responder would arrive at the scene, secure the scene physically, and begin to assess 
how the digital evidence is involved. The responder would take steps to secure the 
digital crime scene, which may include inspecting the devices for physical booby- 
traps and isolating the devices from any networks. The responder then seizes as many 
physical containers~physical media including hard drives, CDs, DVDs~as necessary

84 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
to ensure the seized items reasonably include the information with probative value. 
The seizure of the hardware/physical containers involves labeling all wires connected 
to the computer or devices, and photographing the scene~paying specific attention 
to the labeled connectors. The physical items are seized, documented, packaged, and 
prepared for transport to an oft~ite facility for examination. At the offsite facility, pos- 
sibly the local police agency or a state/regional forensic laboratory, the seized phys- 
ical containers are examined for data objects with evidentiary value. If found, these 
data objects are usually included in a forensic findings report and are printed out or 
copied to other media and then provided to the investigator and prosecutors. Figure 
3.1 outlines the steps of the traditional method for seizing computer hardware.

That sounds pretty straightforward, doesn't it? For the most part, the preceding 
reflects the general process that the wide majority of law enforcement agencies 
follow when it comes to the seizure of digital evidence. As you can see, the general 
methodology reflects a focus on the seizure of the physical items. Further, the pre- 
ceding model shows that a division exists between the investigators / on-scene 
responders and the forensic laboratory/examiners. 
Seizure Methodology in Depth 
Unfortunately, current seizure methodology does not adequately prepare our investi- 
gators to respond to scenes that are more complicated than a single machine sitting 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3

alone in a bare room. The fact is that the world is a messy place. Our responders 
need to understand that they need to have a methodology in place that allows them 
to work through more complicated scenes, such as finding dozens of computers or 
dozens of pieces of removable media or hundreds of CDs. The steps presented in Figure 
3.2 are representative of current seizure methodology, but the steps have been crafted to provide 
a higher level guidance about approaching nonstandard seizure scenes. Specifically, the "Seize 
All Hardware and Media" step shown in Figure 3.1 has been replaced by a series of 
three steps that help guide the responder through identifying all the digital media 
on-scene, minimizing the crime scene through prioritization, and then seizing the 
hardware and media that have the highest probability of containing the relevant evi- 
dence.

We begin our seizure methodology at the scene, where a warrant for digital evi- 
dence is being served. It is assumed in the following that the scene has been physi- 
cally secured, and the responder has a safe working environment. It is also assumed 
that the responder has a properly drafted warrant that identifies the information to 
be seized and outlines that an offsite examination of the media may be required if 
the situation makes the on-scene seizure infeasible. 

86 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
Step 1-Digital Media Identification 
The first step is to begin to canvas the scene in an attempt to locate the digital 
media that you believe has the highest probability of containing the evidentiary 
information described in the warrant. If the suspect has one computer sitting in his 
bedroom and another in a box in the attic, I'd bet my money that the information 
I'm after is the one in his bedroom. Taking a step beyond the simple situations, one 
needs to also consider removable media such as flash drives and CDs or DVDs. Flash 
drives are often held as personal file cabinets and may contain information of a per- 
sonal nature. Look for flash drives on key chains, watches, in cameras, and just about 
anywhere~flash media can be unbelievably small. Another strategy is to look for 
media that contains backups of files from on-scene computer(s). If the information is 
important, you can be sure it will be backed up somewhere. 
Where can digital media be found? The answer is pretty much anywhere. 
Locating very small, but very large storage media could be a significant issue when 
conducting a search. Be sure to balance the perceived technical expertise of the sus- 
pect versus the type of crime versus where you expect to find the relevant informa- 
tion. For example, it is fairly well documented that obsessive collectors of child 
pornography will gather tens-of-thousands of pictures of children being victimized. 
In this type of case, it would be most logical to be looking for a hard-drive or 
optical disks, given the amount of storage required. At this point in time, obtaining 
such large amounts of storage on flash media would be difficult, however. On the 
other hand, the same collector may be accused of taking pictures of children being 
victimized, and in this case the search should definitely focus on small flash 
media-type storage cards that could be used in a digital camera and/or be used to 
store and hide coveted images. 
Documentation is part of every step, so this won't be the last time you see it 
mentioned. Nevertheless, it's worth mentioning here as a reminder. While con- 
ducting the search for digital media, it may be appropriate to narrate your move- 
ments into a voice recorder and to photograph the found media in place before 
moving it. 
Step 2" Minimizing the Crime 
Scene by Prioritizing the Physical Media 
After all the digital media is identified, an effort must be made to determine which 
storage devices or pieces of media have the highest probability of containing the 
information described in the warrant. Why? Because at some point it time, it will be 
impractical to seize all the digital devices, removable media, and storage media at a 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
87 
crime scene. At the current time, it may be possible to walk into a residence and 
only find one computer and maybe a few CDs. In this situation, the minimization of 
the physical media is all but done for you~you have in front of you only a few 
pieces of media that may contain the informational evidence. But technology is 
enabling homeowners to easily build rather complicated networks that may include 
wireless storage devices, multiple operating systems, shared Internet connections, 
integration with traditional entertainment media, and integration with home appli- 
ances and devices. Downloadable and burnable movies and music are generally an 
accepted technology, greatly increasing the amount of optical media found in homes. 
Based on the availability of technology, on-scene responders will be faced with mul- 
tiple computers, storage devices, and dozens to hundreds of pieces of media~all 
adding up to terabytes of information. 
The responder must make some tough decisions about where she believes the 
information will most likely be found. One suggestion is to prepare a prioritized 
ranking to help decide which storage devices and pieces of media should be seized 
for offsite review. The prioritized ranking is also critical in deciding which devices or 
pieces of media are previewed on-scene~one of the options we'll be discussing later 
in this chapter. 
Step 3" Seizure of Storage Devices and Media 
The seizure itself is rather straightforward. After the scene is secured and it is deter- 
mined that the hardware must be seized, the investigator begins by labeling all the 
connections/wires attached to the computer. Be meticulous in the labeling of wires 
and thorough in your documentation. It's a good practice to label both the end of a 
cable and place a matching label where the cable connects~for instance, label a 
Monitor's VGA Cable B 1 and label the computer's VGA port as B 1,; label the mon- 
itor's power cable plug as B 2 and label the wall outlet as B 2'. Photograph as many 
relevant objects and seizure steps as you see fit~digital photos are basically free and 
can be burned to disk and added to the case file. Don't forget to remove the sticky 
labels from the power outlets once they have been photographed. 
After the computer has been labeled, documented, and photographed, disas- 
semble the components and prepare the computer case for shipment. Best practices 
state that an unformatted floppy disk should be placed in the floppy drive with a 
piece of evidence tape sticking out like a flag. The presence of the disk in the floppy 
drive may prevent an accidental boot to the hard drive--but the new trend from 
computer and laptop manufacturers is to omit the standard floppy drives entirely, so 
this recommendation may be deprecated over time. Other options available to pre- 
vent an accidental boot are to unplug the power to the hard drive in a desktop 
www.syngress.com 

88 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
machine and remove the battery from a laptop. Some recommend placing evidence 
tape over the external drives, including the floppy drive and any CD/DVD drives. 
When transporting, be careful not to drop, or otherwise jar or shock, the computer, 
as this may result in damage to the hard drive and possibly the motherboard. When 
transporting, keep the storage devices away from heat and strong magnetic fields, 
such as high-powered radios and big trunk-thumping subwoofers.

laboratory or department that is going to process the seized hard- 
ware. Most have preferred methods for hardware seizure and trans- 
portation. 
To Pull the Plug or Not to 
Pull the Plug, That Is the Question 
I always wondered where the phrase pull the plug originated. I can picture a stressed 
out, overworked computer forensic technician on the phone with an on-scene 
responder, attempting to guide them through a proper shutdown and then a con- 
trolled boot process~prompting the following exchange: 
Responder: It says to hit any key. 
Forensic Tech: Uh-huh. 
Responder: Hang on .... Um... where is the any key? 
Forensic Tech:You've got to be kidding me .... Just pull the @#$@#% plug, 
wrap it in tape, and bring it to me! 
Since that first hypothetical exchange~which still gives me a chuckle when I 
think about it~the mantra from the forensic community has been to pull the plug 
from the back of the machine, regardless of the state of the machine--on, off, 
writing to the drives, or anything else. I have no doubt that, across the board, the sim- 
plest most teachable method of seizure that will generally preserve most of the data and evi- 
dence is to pull the plug from the back of the machine. Pulling the plug and prepping it 
for transfer to an examination lab is the only option that is reasonably teachable in 
a few hours to first responders of any skill level. But, surely, we need to be able to 
do something other than pull the plug. We cannot possibly make advances in this 
field if we limit all officers and agents to a methodology based on the lowest 
common denominator. 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
89 
The most pressing issue relating to pull-the-plug is that some operating systems 
(OSes) really like to be shut down properly. Rapid power loss in some OSes can 
actually corrupt the operating system's kernel or the central module of the system. 
UNIX, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems are the most vulnerable, but some 
Windows-based OSes, such as a Windows 2000 server, should be shut down prop- 
erly. Moore (2005) presents a good review of the proper shutdown method (shut- 
down versus pull-the-plug) for different operating systems based on the operating 
system's ability to recover from rapid power loss. 
Obviously, if you intend to shut down the machine properly, you must deter- 
mine the OS. To determine the OS and to initiate a proper shut down sequence, you 
need to manipulate the computer's mouse and/or keyboard, but manipulating the 
mouse/keyboard will change data on the suspect's machine.You say "But I'm not 
allowed to change data on the suspect's machine!"That may be the guidance given, 
but it is more appropriate to take the position: "I will do the most appropriate and 
reasonable actions during seizure to ensure I retain as much of the relevant informa- 
tion as possible. Here is the documentation of my actions." The focus here is on rea- 
sonableness and the documentation of actions. Also, it is important to key-in on the 
retention of the relevant information, which includes the information of potential evi- 
dentiary value and should not include the Registry changes made to indicate that a 
shutdown occurred. Simply put, moving the mouse to determine the OS and 
starting a shutdown sequence did not place 5,000 images of child pornography on 
the computer's hard drive. However, pulling the plug on a Linux system may actually 
impact the ability to recover those same images. 
There is no one correct answer to the pull-the-plug question. If you have the 
skill and knowledge to determine the operating system of the suspect computer and 
you determine that the operating system and other data could be damaged by 
pulling the plug, then shut the machine down properly. Document your actions and 
explain clearly and knowledgeably how you prevented damage to the computer, and 
possibly to the evidentiary information, by following a shutdown procedure. Show 
how your actions preserved the evidence, as opposed to corrupting it. If you have 
the skill and document the steps you followed, you have solid footing on which to 
defend your actions. If you do not possess such skill, or if the more advanced tech- 
niques are not working in a given situation or on a particular piece of hardware, 
then by all means, pull the plug.

Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
Factors Limiting the 
Wholesale Seizure of Hardware 
Earlier we contrasted the historic seizure context versus the current context and dis- 
cussed how the historic context placed a focus on the on-scene seizure of data 
objects, as compared to the current situation where the focus of the on-scene activi- 
ties is to seize all the physical containers. The question I pose to you is this: Are we 
heading in the right direction by focusing on the seizure of the physical hardware 
(the container items) rather than focusing on the seizure of the relevant information 
(data objects)? 
Earlier seizures of digital evidence focused on data objects because it was 
impractical to attempt to image an entire server, based on the high costs of storage 
media. I suggest we are heading toward a similar impracticality~although this time 
our inability to seize all the information is based on a number of different factors, 
including massively large storage arrays, whole disk encryption, the abundance of 
non-evidentiary information on media and related privacy concerns, and the time 
involved in laboratory forensic analysis. At some point in the future, the process by 
which we image entire pieces of media for forensic analysis will become obsolete 
(Hosmer, 2006). 
I suggest we make the distinction that there other options beyond wholesale 
seizure available to our responders. We need to train our responders to have the 
ability to perform on-scene data preview, full data-image, and imaging of only the 
relevant data objects. Further, we need to begin to change the wholesale seizure 
paradigm now~for all responders not just the specialists~before we are faced with 
a greater volume of cases we are ill prepared to address. 
Size of Media 
Storage devices are getting big~very big. Now, at the end of 2006, it is quite 
common for a single hard drive to contain 100 gigabytes of information~roughly 
equivalent to a library floor of academic journals. It is very achievable for the home 
user, both technologically and financially, to put together a 2-terabyte storage 
array~an array that could house the complete works within an entire academic 
research library (SIMS, 2003). Storage is relatively cheap, and people are taking 
advantage of the extra space by storing music, movies, and creating mirrored backups 
(RAID 1 arrays). The typical crime that involves a computer won't include a multi- 
hundred terabyte server, but showing up at a crime scene with a 200-gigabyte desti- 

Seizure of Digital Information 
9 Chapter 3 
91 
nation drive and finding a 1.5-terabyte RAID will certainly have a negative impact 
on your ability to create an on-scene image of the data. 
What exactly happens when the full 1.5 TB RAID and 200 DVDs are seized 
and brought back to the forensic laboratory for analysis. Do you actually have the 
hardware and software to acquire and process that much data? If the laboratory is not 
a regional or state lab, but a small laboratory set up at the local agency, the answer 
might be yes--but processing the case might use the entire budget set aside for 
target drives for the entire year for that one case. Once the data is examined, does 
the jurisdiction or local policy dictate that the imaged data be archived? At some 
point, the ability to seize and process everTthin 2 will exceed the budget set aside for 
the purchase of forensic processing computers, target drives, and archival media and 
will also exceed the time available for forensic examiners to process the case. 
Disk Encryption 
A number of encryption programs exist now that provide whole disk encryption, a 
common one being PGP from pgp.com. These types of encryption programs 
encrypt all the data on the hard drive and are generally transparent to the user; 
meaning that one password in the startup sequence "unlocks" the contents for 
viewing and editing. Of course, looming on the horizon is the Windows Vista oper- 
ating system, purported to incorporate BitLocker Drive Encryption tied to the 
Trusted Platform Module cryptographic chip in the higher-end versions of the 
operating system. 
Whole disk encryption has some serious implications for law enforcement when 
performing seizures. First, if a whole disk encryption is enabled on a running com- 
puter, and the computer is shut down or the power is removed, there is a very good 
chance that the data on the drives will be unrecoverable without the proper key. 
Responders may need to determine if a whole disk encryption program is enabled 
before shutting down / pulling-the-plug on a computer during seizure. If one is pre- 
sent, bringing the computer back to the lab for analysis may be futile. One of the 
best chances to retrieve the evidentiary information is when the machine is running 
and the user has access to the files. Second, the implementation of the TPM chip 
may lock the drive so the data may only become available on a specific machine. 
This would prevent an image of the drive from being booted in another computer 
or viewed with a computer forensics program. The use of disk encryption is forcing 
law enforcement to have other data seizure options available beyond the seizure of 
physical hardware.

Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
Privacy Concerns 
Personal computers often contain myriad information about a person's life, including 
financial, medical, and other personal information, information related to their job 
(such as work products), and even information owned by several people, possibly a 
spouse, family member, or roommate. It's unclear how the criminal and civil courts 
would view a challenge from an impacted third party regarding the seizure of a 
common computer. However, if that third party maintained a blog or Web site, their 
information may be protected from seizure under the Privacy Protection Act (PPA) 
(42 U.S.C. ~" 2000aa).The PPA was specifically developed to provide journalists with 
protection from warrants issued to obtain information about sources or people 
addressed in their publications. The PPA reads "...it shall be unlawful for a govern- 
ment officer or employee, in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a 
criminal offense, to search for or seize any work product materials possessed by a 
person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a news- 
paper, book, broadcast, or other similar form of public communication." The PPA 
may not protect the person that possesses the information if that person is suspected 
of committing the criminal offenses to which the materials are related. Simply put, if 
you committed a crime and you have publishable information related to that crime 
on your computer, that information most likely will not be protected under the 
PPA. However, the PPA may protect the interests of a third party that uses or stores 
data on a computer, and may possibly protect the information of the accused if the 
information does not relate to the crime being investigated. 
The potential situations of co-mingled evidentiary data and publishable mate- 
rials, each owned by a separate person do sound unlikely if you only consider a 
single computer. But what if you consider a network addressable storage device 
located in a home network? For example, let's say that such a storage device exists at 
the scene of a seizure. Every member of the household stores information on the 
device, and little Susie's unposted blog entries on her life-as-a-brainy-15-year-old- 
girl are located on the storage device commingled with the information described in 
the warrant. Although you may seize the storage device, you may also be involved 
with other court proceedings related to the violation of the PPA~civil, and possibly 
criminal, proceedings where you are the defendant! 
The Secret Service ran across a similar situation in the case of Steve.Jackson 
Games, Inc. v. Secret Service (Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. Secret Service, 816 E Supp. 432 
[W.D. Tex. 1993]). The Secret Service seized two computers from the company, 
believing that the company's system administrator had stored evidence of a crime on 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
93 
company computers. The day after seizure, the Secret Service learned that the com- 
puters contained materials intended for publication; materials that belonged to the 
company. Regardless, the Secret Service did not return the computers until several 
months had passed. The district court ruled that the Secret Service had in fact vio- 
lated the PPA and awarded Steve Jackson Games $50,000 in damages and $250,000 
in attorney's fees. The story of this raid goes well beyond the short summary pro- 
vided here. The raid and the trial play a significant role in hacker mythology and also 
played a part in the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (Sterling, 
1994). Nonetheless, the moral of the story is that the Secret Service was not pre- 
pared to seize the specific information described in the warrant when they learned 
of the to-be-published materials present on the seized hardware. It's not known how 
the Secret Service would have changed their seizure methodology if they knew 
about the publishable materials before they served the warrant~but, for example, if 
they didn't have the capability of solely seizing the relevant data objects, the Secret 
Service might have had no other option but to seize the hardware. This example 
goes to show that having other seizure options available may be a critical skill that 
determines the success of an investigation. 
Delays Related to Laboratory Analysis 
If investigators of crimes involving a computer rely completely and absolutely on 
their computer forensic laboratory for the processing of their seized hardware in 
search of evidence, they are at the mercy of the timing dictated by the laboratory. 
From my experience, a computer forensic laboratory can process anywhere from 30 
to 60 cases per examiner per year; possibly more depending on the types of cases 
they work and their equipment, but considering most forensic laboratories are gov- 
ernment agencies, I doubt they are operating year after year on the most current 
computers available. To make matters worse, the increase in the size of storage media 
has far outpaced the increases in processor power. The same $500 that could afford a 
100MB drive in 1991 can now put a 750GB drive in your pocket. Compare that to 
a 50-MHz Intel from 1991, next to a 3-GHz processor in today's fastest computers, 
and you'll see that the cost effectiveness of hard drives grew 125 times faster than 
that of processors from 1991 to the present (Gilder, 2006). Depending on the 
backlog at the laboratory, investigators can be faced with waiting up to--and over~ 
a year for the results of their examination to be returned from the lab. 
I am unable to specifically quantify how delays in the forensic examination are 
impacting investigations and prosecutions, but I can offer my opinion that delays in 
the processing of digital evidence are one of the most significant impediments in 
www.syngress.com 

94 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
investigations and prosecutions that have a digital-evidence nexus. Given the oppor- 
tunity to perform an on-scene seizure of the relevant information versus being 
forced to wait one year for the results from the laboratory, the choice will be clear 
for many investigators. However, there are difficulties and challenges in seizing the 
information on-scene~but these challenges must be weighed against the time delay 
in receiving the processed evidence. 
One investigator I interviewed about this type of situation described a child 
pornography possession case where there was a chance that the accused possessor 
was also creating and distributing images of child sexual abuse. Unfortunately, the 
investigator had no means to preview the digital information on-scene, nor back at 
the department, nor did the investigator have the ability to perform a digital infor- 
mation analysis in-house. The computer was sent off to a computer forensics labora- 
tory, where it sat in the queue behind other just-as-important cases. Because the 
information could not be reviewed, the investigator had no evidence to substantiate 
the drafting of an arrest warrant for either the possession of child pornography or 
the child sexual abuse. In such cases, any delay caused by a backlog at a forensics lab- 
oratory not only impacts an investigation, but also has a direct effect on a (potential) 
victim and continued victimization. 
Protecting the Time of 
the Most Highly Trained Personnel 
Digital devices have become almost completely ubiquitous in our current society. 
The legends of"convergence" are slowly coming true, where the line between com- 
puters, cell pones, cameras, and so on is now fuzzy and may disappear altogether in 
the future. IPv6 looms on the horizon and promises to equip every device, from cars 
to toasters, with an IP address. How do we find the time to train our law enforce- 
ment community in an entirely new set of skills? What is the balance between 
knowing enough and making a specialist out of everyone? 
Determining whether the individual data objects with evidentiary value are 
seized or the storage media is seized will likely depend on the technical prowess of 
the responding investigator. The best situation would be to have a team of highly 
trained digital evidence seizure specialists respond and then properly prepare a 
Windows computer for seizure. The reality is that there will never be enough com- 
puter specialists to respond to every crime scene~let alone a "team" of them~to 
seize every piece of information or computer involved either directly or peripherally 
in a crime. 
Looking forward, we can anticipate that the number of computers and other 
electronic devices requiring seizure and examination to surely increase. Clearly, from 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
95 
all accounts of the situation, the current methodology has its flaws. Delays in the 
examination of seized digital media are frustrating investigators and are impacting 
prosecutions. Although we clearly need more computer forensic specialists, do we 
have the resources~specifically the personnel, time, and money--to train and equip 
enough specialists to meet the current demand for seizures and exams? What about 
future demands? From what I have observed, I don't believe we have anywhere near 
the number of qualified personnel to address the current issues, let alone what the 
future will hold. Nor do I believe that the existing infrastructure can support the 
required increase in the number of computer forensic examiners or specialists. Most 
agencies fight for the addition of a single position~so I'm doubtful that the system 
will suddenly change and begin hiring scores of new personnel. 
The situation comes down to a simple law of economics: productivity will only 
be increased by adding more people or making existing people more efficient. We 
don't really have the ability to throw more people at the problem, so the only option 
is to do more with the people we have. As it pertains to cyber crimes and crimes 
with a high-technology component, this means we cannot continue to rely on com- 
puter specialists for every aspect of an investigation that involves a computer. Every 
law enforcement agent, from on-scene responders to detectives performing investiga- 
tions, now have a duty to begin to pick up the slack that has created the conflict 
between the large--and growing~number of crimes with a high-technology com- 
ponent and the relatively small number of specialists available to work these types of 
cases. We need to consider the computer specialists and the computer forensic labo- 
ratories as a finite resource, and any constructive work performed in the field by 
patrol officers or detectives reduces the strain on the forensic system. With this view, 
the most valued resource is the time of the highest-trained individuals. 
The general scenario of protecting the time of the most highly trained individ- 
uals so that they may focus on the most important issues is not a new concept. 
Those trained in hazardous material response work under a pyramid-like distribution 
of knowledge; the wide base of the pyramid consists of awareness-level trained 
people, while the small tip of the pyramid consists of highly trained specialists. Not 
only are these training levels generally accepted within the hazardous material 
response community, but they are codified in 29 CFI~ 1910.120(q) (6). The training 
code establishes the general level of knowledge, the hours of required training, and 
what can be expected from responders that have achieved each of the training levels. 
Because the different training levels are clearly defined, each responder on-scene 
understands their role and, more importantly, the role of other responders. Those 
with awareness-level training are taught to basically recognize that something bad has 
happened, call for help and watch from a distance with binoculars. Operations-level 
training prepares responders to respond in a defensive fashion, without attempting to 
www.syngress.com 

96 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
stop the release. Technician-level responders are trained to attempt to stop hazardous 
material release, and specialist-level responders usually have specific knowledge per- 
taining to a particular chemical. At each level, the responder receives more training 
to be better prepared when responding to a scene. 
At the current time, it would not be practical to attempt to regulate or codify 
the training requirements or duties of those involved in digital evidence seizure, but 
it is important to recognize that people of different training levels will likely 
approach seizure in different ways (see Figure 3.3). 
The seizure methodology that is developed for the knowledge level of the non- 
technical responder is in direct conflict with the best possible seizure scenario. Any 
seizure methodology adopted by an agency must be fluid enough to allow a mini- 
mally trained responder and a highly trained responder to both seize the digital 
information in the manner most applicable to their knowledge level. 
Figure 3.3 Digital Evidence Seizure

The Concept of the First Responder 
Who exactly is the "First 1Kesponder" referenced in numerous digital evidence 
seizure guidelines and reports? Is the first responder simply the person that happens 
to be on-scene first? If yes, then the first responder could be any line officer. If every 
first responder needs to be trained to seize digital evidence, and we acknowledge 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3

that the seizure methodology will be necessarily fluid based on the responder's tech- 
nical knowledge, you begin to see the problems involved with designing one partic- 
ular training for first responders. 
A second issue is the number of hours of training that could be allotted for first 
responder training. Will the administration of an organization allow their personnel 
to take a half-day course on digital evidence seizure? Probably. Realistically, though, 
what could you cover in four hours of instruction? I would guess the limit would be 
the recognition of digital evidence. So, would a two- or three-day training be suffi- 
cient to cover the recognition of digital evidence plus the seizure of digital informa- 
tion? Possibly, but would the people attending that training still be considered first 
responders or would the additional training necessitate they become specialists in this 
area? I am doubtful an agency's administration would agree to send every line officer 
to a three-day training to be first responders. 
We are clearly caught in a catch-22. All line officers need to be able to seize 
digital evidence, but the first responder-level of training may not fully equip the 
officers to seize the evidence. The level of training required to more completely 
understand the digital evidence seizure process may involve multiple days of 
training, and multiple days of training on a single topic will most likely not be pro- 
vided to all line officers. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as identifying one cadet 
in the academy that will specialize in investigating crimes with a cyber component, 
and putting this cadet through weeks of specialized training. The ubiquity of com- 
puters and digital evidence make the training of one single person insignificant~ 
everyone's expertise needs to be raised to allow the specialists to focus on more 
technically challenging crimes. 
There will be no clear-cut answer to this dilemma, but a number of factors 
could help mitigate the issue. First, law enforcement officers need more training in 
general computer skills. During a law enforcement officer's daily work, which is 
more likely? Arrest a suspect, be involved in a shooting, or spend some time working 
at a computer? The answer is a no-brainer~computers are an integral part of the 
law enforcement landscape and most officers cannot go a day without having some 
level of mission-critical interaction with a computer. However, the general level of 
computer knowledge among law enforcement personnel is low, and use of a com- 
puter is rarely a focus of academy setting. Providing law enforcement with basic, fun- 
damental computer skills would not only impact their views toward digital evidence, 
but would also positively impact their daily work activities. 
Second, all law enforcement personnel should receive basic awareness-level 
training on digital evidence. Awareness-level training need only cover the basics of a 
computer and where digital evidence may be stored. It is important for all officers to 
recognize that storage media, particularly flash-based media, may be no larger than a

postage stamp, yet possibly contain several gigabytes of information. Understanding 
that many seemingly single-purpose devices, such as cell phones or mp3 players, may 
contain other types of information~for example, documents may be stored on an 
mp3 player~will have important investigative implications far beyond simple search 
and seizure concerns. Perhaps the next time a drug dealer is arrested with a PSR you 
may want to search him for a small flash media card--as a dealer, his contact list 
might be accessed from the flash card on the PSR Until a more uniform level of 
basic knowledge and awareness is reached among law enforcement, it is hard to 
speculate how the increased awareness will benefit investigations. But as the saying 
goes, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take, and more appropriately, you 
miss 100 percent of the evidence you don't look for. 
Third, any seizure methodology developed and/or adopted by an agency must 
be fluid to allow for seizures to be conducted by both minimally trained individuals 
as well as highly trained specialists. Do you want to put your specialist on the spot 
when he breaks protocol to perform a function that is technically more appropriate? 
Conversely, do you want the specialist to be on-scene at every warrant service, arrest, 
or vehicle search? There must be options within the methodology that allow each 
officer to act reasonably according to their skill level. 
Other Options for 
Seizing Digital Evidence 
The wholesale seizure of the physical storage device/media is arguably the most 
common form of seizure practiced by law enforcement responders today. The ques- 
tion remains, are there other options besides the seizure of physical devices that are 
available to responders? If yes, are these methods of seizure within the reach of 
anyone but the most technical of responders? 
For a long time, up to and including today, many in the forensics community 
place little faith in the ability for responders on-scene to deal appropriately with 
the computers they may encounter. The direction was simply "Don't touch the key- 
board. Pull the plug and send everything to the lab." In many cases, the forensics 
side Of the house is correct to protect against the possible corruption or destruction 
of data by taking this hard-line approach~particularly based on the technology of 
yesterday~but at what cost? Although the computer forensics community might 
have intended to do the most good by promulgating the pull-the-plug mantra, we 
need to examine how disempowering the on-scene responders may affect the 
overall forensic process, from seizure through analysis to investigation and ultimately 
prosecution. 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
99 
The latest Search and Seizure of Computers and Obtaining Digital Evidence (Manual), 
published by the Department of Justice supports the proposition that the seizure of 
digital evidence should be an incremental process, based both on the situation and 
the training level of the responder. The Manual describes an incremental approach as 
a search strategy (pg. 221) for the seizure of digital evidence from a functioning 
company where the wholesale seizure of all the computers from the company would 
be impractical. 
The Manual provides the following steps in its incremental approach: 
1. After arriving on-scene, Agents will attempt to identify a systems adminis- 
trator or similar person who would be willing to assist law enforcement in 
identifying, copying and/or printing out copies of the relevant files or data 
objects defined in the warrant. 
2. 
If there are no company employees available to assist the Agent, the Agent 
will ask a computer expert to attempt to locate the computer files 
described in the warrant and will attempt to make electronic copies of 
those files. It is assumed that if the Agent is an expert, he/she would be able 
to proceed with the retrieval of the evidence. 
3. 
If the Agent or expert are unable to retrieve the files, or if the onsite search 
proves infeasible for technical reasons, then the next option is to create an 
image of those parts of the computer that are likely to store the informa- 
tion described in the warrant. 
4. 
If imaging proves impractical or impossible for technical reasons, then the 
Agent is to seize those components and storage media that the Agent rea- 
sonably believes includes the information described in the warrant. 
The Manual has a focus on Federal law enforcement and the incremental search 
strategy is described in the context of responding to a functioning business where 
evidence of" a crime may reside on the business's systems~hence, the focus in the 
Manual on gaining assistance from the business's systems administrator. Even though, 
realistically, you are not going to ask the suspect for help in retrieving the files of 
interest, there is good reason to expand this incremental search strategy to the search 
and seizure of" digital information that resides on non-business systems. First, many 
home users set up networks similar to what would be present in a small business. 
Second, the amount of storage on a home network may exceed the amount of 
storage used for business purposes, as home users are more likely to possess large 
music and movie files. Lastly, current and impending technologies such as whole disk 
encryption make the offsite analysis of storage media impractical, if not impossible. A 
mechanism must be developed now that enables responders to pull evidence off of a

100 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
running system before these types of systems are in widespread use. Otherwise, we 
may be changing the paradigm a few years too late. 
Although the change in focus from hardware-as-evidence to information-as-evi- 
dence may be a radical departure from how many people currently view digital evi- 
dence, it is not exactly a new viewpoint. In fact, the change to a focus on the 
information as evidence may be a renaissance of sorts; the computer crime investiga- 
tors of yesterday knew nothing other than the retrieval of relevant information from 
servers and networks. Much of the investigation of computer crime in a historic 
context related to examining events that occurred within a network infrastructure. In 
his book from the pre-World-Wide-Web year of 1990, Spectacular Computer Crimes, 
Buck Bloombecker discusses numerous computer crimes, most of which involve 
attacks on the network infrastructure (virus, worm) or schemes that were enabled by 
the presence of a network infrastructure, such as stealing unauthorized computer 
time or manipulating the wire transfer system to steal bank funds. 
Crimes with a cyber component changed dramatically following the personal 
computing revolution, which was hand-in-hand with the rise of the World Wide 
Web. Prior to the 1990s, few people with personal computers used them solely for 
personal purposes. Prior to the 2000s, few people were providing personal informa- 
tion about themselves for the world to view. So it's not surprising that when we take 
a look backward, we see that the investigation of cyber crime involved incident 
response tasks, like pulling logs and records off of servers and other infrastructure- 
level digital devices, and less often concerned the seizure of a personal computer. 
Wholesale duplication of servers was impractical, storage costs were high, and so it 
was cost prohibitive to attempt to pull together the necessary equipment to image 
the entire server. Although the investigators of the time were breaking new ground, 
they knew enough to document their actions, make best efforts not to change the 
data objects with evidentiary value, and image the relevant data objects so they could 
be printed or referred to at a later date. Responders to network intrusion events 
were faced with no other option but to seize the relevant data objects~which is still 
the case today. 
Responding to a Victim of a 
Crime Where Digital Evidence Is Involved 
There is an old saying that all politics are local politics. Although I'm not quite con- 
vinced of the particular weight of that adage, I do believe that all crime is local 
crime. The Internet may have created a global community, but crime, even crimes 
committed over the Internet, will be reported to a local agency. It is imperative that 
local agencies have the ability to field a complaint regarding a crime with a cyber 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
101 
component and be able to respond appropriately. I have heard horror stories where 
complaints of e-mail harassment, auction fraud, and other crimes with a cyber com- 
ponent were just ignored by a local agency.Yes, a statement was taken and a report 
prepared, but no follow-up investigation was conducted. Worse, I have heard of 
agencies telling victims that the investigation of their complaint involved the seizure 
of their machine for forensic analysis, and that the analysis might take over a year to 
complete. I think it's pretty obvious why the complaint was dropped. 
The unfortunate part of the situation is that the responding officer (or local 
agency) places an improper focus on the technology and loses sight of the crime that 
occurred. Often, the technology used is secondary and of little relevance. It could be 
quite possible that harassing statements in an e-mail might be coming from someone 
the victim already knew. If the harassment occurred through some other non-seize- 
able, non-virtual means (for example, spray paint on a car), the officer would most 
likely follow up with a knock-and-talk with the suspect. The follow-up on the e- 
mail harassment should use the same logic. Does the investigation need to be 
focused on tracing an e-mail to its source when you already have a good idea as to 
who sent the e-mail? It is important that investigators do not switch off their inves- 
tigative skills because a computer is involved. 
When responding to a victim, the focus must be on having the victim provide 
the law enforcement officer with something that substantiates their complaint~a 
print-out of the harassing e-mail with full header information, a cut-and-paste 
printout of the IM conversation where their child was sexually solicited, or a screen- 
print of a disturbing Web page. Any information that can be provided by the victim 
to a responding officer will increase efficiencies in the entire investigative process. 
The officer will be able to read the e-mail header and get preservation orders out to 
the ISPs; the detectives will be able to begin working the case, rather than securing 
another statement from the victim; and the computer forensics system won't be bur- 
dened by yet another machine requiring examination~particularly for data objects 
that could have reasonably been obtained on-scene. 
Cases occur where the victim's computer must be seized. Harassments in e-mail 
or chat (when logging) that violate a protective order may have to be seized, 
depending on the situation. If a spouse or roommate finds child pornography on a 
computer, the computer should be seized since it contains contraband. But barring 
these unavoidable circumstances, the seizure of victim computers is often unneces- 
sary and contributes to the logjam at the digital forensic laboratories. 
When communicating with a victim, be sure you let them know to not delete 
anything on their system until their complaint has gone through the entire process. 
Also be quite sure to document the steps the victim took to provide you with the 
substantiating evidence. If you had to assist the victim in any way--maybe you 

102 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
showed them how to see full headers on an e-mail, for example~make sure those 
actions appear in the documentation. Make a note of the system time on the com- 
puter, and verify that the evidence contains a time and date stamp, and that the time 
and date make sense to the victim. Lastly, be responsive to the victim's needs. Many 
crimes with a cyber component~particularly frauds and thefts~will have an inter- 
national component that makes the apprehension of a suspect and reimbursement to 
the victim nearly impossible. Be sympathetic and provide the victim with any 
resources that can assist them in dealing with banks, credit card companies, and cred- 
itors, such as a properly written police report. They have already been victimized; 
don't let your actions lead to a prolonging of the victimization. 
Seizure Example 
Here we will examine an example of a digital seizure to help explore the options 
available to on-scene responders. Let's start by saying that Sally receives a harassing e- 
mail from an anonymous sender. She believes it is a former co-worker named Sam, 
who has harassed Sally using non-computer-based methods before. The officer fol- 
lows the guidance discussed in the "Responding to a Victim of a Crime Where 
Digital Evidence Is Involved" section and instructs Sally to print off a copy of the e- 
mail showing the full header information. Sally prints off the e-mail as substantiating 
proof to back up her complaint, and the officer leaves the scene with a statement 
from Sally and a copy of the harassing e-mail. 
You notice that Sally was not told that her computer would need to be seized 
and held for a year--which would, in effect, cause Sally to drop her criminal com- 
plaint and also drop her opinion of the police. Instead, the officer leaves the victim 
scene with a statement, and some level of proof to back up the complaint, which 
allows the investigation to proceed without undue hardship to the victim. 
The investigator then uses the information contained in the e-mail header to 
contact the e-mail provider, legal paperwork is sent to the provider looking for the 
account holder's information, and finally the e-mail is traced back to Sam's Internet 
service provider (ISP) account. We now have a general confirmation that the e-mail 
was sent from a computer connected to Sam's ISP account~although this could be 
any number of computers at Sam's house and possibly even be a neighbor using 
Sam's wireless access. 
The investigator drafts a search warrant affidavit looking specifically for the 
information that is relevant to this case~specifically a preserved copy of the sent e- 
mail. The investigator is careful to focus the search warrant on the information to be 
seized, and does not focus on the containers or storage media in which the informa- 
tion may reside. The investigator further notes that an incremental approach will be 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
103 
used, which dictates that onsite seizures will occur when possible, but that factors yet 
to be determined may necessitate that all digital storage devices and media that may 
reasonably contain the sought after evidence may be seized for offsite review. 
The investigator serves the warrant and finds a single computer at Sam's home. 
The system is on and, according to the suspect, has a Windows XP operating system. 
Based on the suspect's assertion that the computer is password-protected, and he has 
not given the password out to anyone, it is reasonable to believe that the computer is 
used solely by its owner. At this point, the on-scene investigator is staring at a 
glowing monitor with a happy desktop picture of calming fields and clouds, but the 
investigator is now faced with a few tough decisions. The computer appears to be 
running Windows XP, which corroborates the suspect's statement. Windows XP can 
survive a rapid power loss, so pulling the plug is an option, but pulling the plug 
means that the entire computer would need to be brought back to the computer 
forensics laboratory for examination. The investigator knows that the backlog at the 
computer forensics laboratory is approaching six months~way too long to deter- 
mine if the suspect is stalking the victim. In six months, the stalking could escalate if 
there is no police intervention (depending on the type of stalker), and the victim 
could be physically assaulted. Further, the investigator knows that Windows XP is 
equipped with the Windows Encrypted File System, a seldom-used folder and file 
encryption system that, if enabled, would make the recovery of the information on 
the system very difficult without the suspect's cooperation. 
The investigator thinks of other options at his disposal. The investigator could 
use a software preview tool in an attempt to locate the information stated in the 
warrant. In this case, Sam uses Microsoft Outlook as his local e-mail client, and a .pst 
file containing all the Outlook-related folders would exist on the system. This .pst 
should contain an e-mail in the sent items folder that matches the e-mail received by 
the victim. If the investigator had reason to believe there was information stored in 
the RAM that would be relevant to the case, the investigator could dump the RAM 
for later analysis. This might be the scenario if the investigator notices a draft of 
another e-mail currently on the screen. If the e-mail is found in the .pst during a 
preview, the entire drive could be imaged, or just the .pst could be imaged if the 
investigator has reason to believe that imaging the entire drive would be difficult. 
In this example, maybe the investigator would decide to pull-the-plug and 
deliver it to the lab. Maybe the investigator believes there is enough evidence based 
on the victim's complaint to have the suspect come to the station for a talk about 
what is going on. But maybe the investigator's hair on the back of his neck rises up 
when talking to the suspect and the investigator gets a gut reaction about the level 
of urgency regarding the case. Maybe the on-scene preview and securing the .pst 
provides the investigator with enough evidence to take the suspect into custody. The

important point is that without additional options to review the digital data, the 
investigator's hands are tied. 
In line with the incremental approach described in the Manual, the investigator 
may have other options available besides wholesale seizure, such as:

9 
On-scene seizure of information through the imaging of a specific data 
object 
In the next section, we take a look at the preceding options and discuss how 
each fits into the larger picture of responding to and investigating crimes with digital 
evidence. 
Previewing On-Scene 
Information to Determine the Presence 
and Location of Evidentiary Data Objects 
The on-scene responder must make conclusions about where the information 
described in the warrant is most likely to be present on the storage device or media. 
In the case of a CD or DVD, the preview is much less complicated, as the chances of 
inadvertently writing to a piece of optical media are much lower than if they were 
working with magnetic-based media. With a CD or a DVD, the responder could use 
a forensics laptop running any number of computer forensic tools to quickly acquire 
and examine the contents of a CD or DVD for review. A similar process could be 
conducted for flash-based media, although a greater level of care may need to be 
taken to ensure the media is not changed. Here, flexibility is once again a critical 
characteristic. Previewing a few pieces of optical media on-scene may be appro- 
priate, but greater numbers of media may need to be taken off-scene for review at 
the laboratory. 
Technology exists that enables responders to preview the data on the storage 
media in an effort to locate the information described in the warrant. These 
"forensic preview software" packages, now in their infancy, are becoming more 
accepted within the community that investigates crimes involving a computer. The 
most common preview software packages come on CD and are essentially a Linux 
operating system that runs completely in the RAM and does not require any 

Seizure of Digital Information 
9 Chapter 3 
105 
resources from the hard drive(s). Several of these disks are in current use by law 
enforcement, including Knoppix, Helix, and Spada. Several controlled boots will 
need to be performed to ensure the correct changes are made to the BIOS to direct 
the computer to boot from the CD. Although best practices should be determined 
locally, I recommend that the power to all the hard drives in desktop computers be 
disconnected and that laptop hard drives be removed while controlled boots are 
conducted to determine how to change the boot sequence in the BIOS. Further 
information on using controlled boots to examine and change BIOS and CMOS 
information can be found in the seizure procedures in the publication Forensic 
Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement (NIJ, 2004). 
Once the system is booted to the forensic preview software, the computer's hard 
drives can be mounted, or made available, in Linux as read-only. Once mounted, the 
preview software will provide the responder with an interface to either search for 
the desired information through keyword searches, or the responder can navigate 
through the directory tree in an attempt to locate a given file or directory. If the 
information described in the warrant is located during a preview, the responder may 
choose to image the specific data object, file, or folder where the information is 
located. The responder may also choose to seize the entire hard drive, now that the 
preview has provided him with a greater level of comfort that this particular "con- 
tainer" includes the desired information. 
Over time, these forensic preview software packages will continue to evolve 
and develop as the problems with wholesale seizure become more evident and the 
need to focus the seizure of individual data objects from a digital crime scene 
becomes more apparent. It is hoped that the evolution of these tools will include 
the addition of features and special characteristics that make a tool "law enforce- 
ment specific." The lack of law enforcement specific features, such as intuitive 
interfaces, audit trail recordkeeping, and the production of evidence-quality data, 
are often an impediment to the adoption of commercial software by the law 
enforcement community (ISTS, 2004). 
Obtaining Information 
from a Running Computer 
If the investigator encounters a computer that is running, and the investigator 
believes there is information of evidentiary value stored in the computer's active 
memory, or RAM, there are options available that allow for the RAM to be recov- 
ered. For example, let's examine a situation where an investigator shows up on-scene 
at a location where a suspect has been chatting online with a minor or undercover 
officer. When the officers arrive at the scene, the suspect quickly closes the chat 
r-- 
9 
www.syngress.com 

106 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
window. By default, many chat programs do not keep a log of the chat sessions and 
almost all of the actual chat activity happens in a portion of the program running in 
the computer's RAM. Without being able to obtain a dump, or download of the 
RAM, there would be little chance to obtain any information from the suspect's 
computer about the chat session that just occurred. Chatting is not the only type of 
data that would be held in RAM. Passwords, unsaved documents, unsaved drafts of 
e-mails, IM conversations, and so on could all be held in the RAM, and in no other 
place on the computer. The investigator needs to make a decision if the information 
described in the warrant would reasonably be found in the RAM of the computer. 
If the warrant describes information related to proof of embezzlement, there may be 
little reason to believe that the data held in the RAM would be relevant to the case. 
That is not to say that it isn't possible~but the responder needs to go through the 
process of determining the locations that have the highest probability of containing 
the information described in the warrant. Even if the suspect had worked on a rele- 
vant file and remnants of the same existed in the RAM, it would be logical to con- 
clude that the file would be saved onto more permanent media, such as the hard 
drive. On the other hand, if the warrant detailed information related to inappro- 
priate chat or instant messaging sessions, the RAM of the running computer would 
be the primary, and most likely the only, location where the information described 
in the warrant could exist. In this case, the use of a program such as Helix to 
"dump" the RAM to the responder's storage device would be a very high priority 
(Shipley, 2006). 
Be careful about what you wish for, however, as the RAM dump could include 
several gigabytes of semi-random information. Pieces of documents, Registry keys, 
API calls, and a whole host of other garbage will be interwoven into a gigantic text 
file. Minimization still is a factor even when the RAM has been identified as being 
one of the locations where relevant data could exist~if the data might reside else- 
where, it may be more productive to go that route than to attempt to carve it from 
the RAM dump. 
SEARCH, a national law enforcement training organization, recently published a 
primer on the collection of evidence from a running computer, which involves 
using preview software to obtain the contents of the RAM from a running machine 
before seizure (Shipley, 2006). SEARCH's article represents a departure from the 
norm in that the article recognizes that changes to the computer operating system 
will occur when a USB drive is inserted into the machine in order to receive the 
contents of the RAM. However, the important point highlighted by the SEARCH 
article is that the changes are known, explainable, and do not affect any information 
that has evidentiary value. "Hold on" you say, "moving the mouse and/or inserting a 
USB device will change the information on the suspect's drive, and that is strictly 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
107 
forbidden!" In response, I say that there are many in the investigative and legal com- 
munities that see little issue with a law enforcement agent performing operations 
that changed data on a suspect's hard drive or other media~as long as the agent 
acted in a reasonable manner and documented their actions appropriately. The firm 
and absolute stance that data cannot be changed needs to be examined to determine 
if our cases have been negatively affected by the promulgation of bad advice. 
Imaging Information On-Scene 
Imaging of an entire hard drive on-scene is fairly common among the more techni- 
cally savvy digital crime scene responders~even more so for private sector investiga- 
tors that often face cases where the hard drives need to be examined, but the 
business in question is not comfortable with letting the original drive out of their 
possession. In both of these cases, the analysis of the imaged drive usually occurs 
back at the laboratory. Rarely do you hear of a drive being both imaged and pre- 
viewed on-scene~although such a process may actually address a number of con- 
cerns about the use of preview software to review the information on a drive while 
on-scene~specifically, performing a preview of the evidence on the original drive. 
While the acquisition of an image of a drive on-scene may be fairly common 
among the more technically skilled, usually for corporate crimes, we find there is 
little use of this technique by less skilled personnel for low-level crimes. However, 
there are a number of good reasons to perform imaging on-scene for most computer 
crimes. First, as mentioned earlier, previews of the evidence can be performed on the 
imaged copy with less worry about the investigator inadvertently damaging informa- 
tion on the original hard drive. Second, in those instances where outside concerns 
prevent the seizure of the physical media, such as PPA concerns, third-party data, and 
multiple users of the computer, the imaging of the hard drive provides another 
option for the on-scene investigators. 
Continued

Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
Imaging Finite Data Objects On-Scene 
In the current law enforcement climate, there is little discussion of the seizure of 
particular pieces of information. Generally, the entire computer is seized~and the 
seized computer is usually called "evidence." The data contained within the com- 
puter are reviewed at a later date for any files or other pieces of information that can 
help prove or disprove a given premise. From an outsider's perspective, it would 
appear as if the seizure of the entire computer is the preferred method of obtaining 
the evidentiar 7 information, but we've established that imaging on-scene is fairly 
well accepted within the digital investigative community. So, are there other options 
that include the seizure of a finite number of data objects as evidence? 
If we can image the entire hard drive on-scene, there is an argument that we can 
image sections of it. We routinely ask companies and ISPs to do just that when we 
ask them to preserve evidence of a crime~rarely do we seize the ISP's servers, nor 
do we ask them to provide an image of the entire server so a computer forensics 
exam can be performed. Are there reasons why we can't use the same logic when 
responding to a suspect? The larger question is whether this type of seizure is appro- 
priate. Are there circumstances when a finite amount of information is needed to 
prove guilt, and the seizure of the original hard drive is not an option? This discus- 
sion is very similar to the previous discussion regarding imaging the entire drive on- 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
109 
scene in situations where the physical media cannot be seized. There may also be sit- 
uations where a finite piece of information would suffice to move the case forward. 
In these situations, the seizure of a finite number of data objects may be a viable 
option for responders. 
In our case example discussed earlier, where Sam is accused of stalking Sally, let's 
assume that an arrest warrant hinged on the presence of the harassing e-mail on 
Sam's computer. If the preview of the computer showed that the e-mail in question 
existed on Sam's computer, and the investigator had the ability to image the .pst file 
that contained the e-mail, the investigator could take Sam into custody at this time 
and have all the evidence needed to wrap up the case. There would be no need to 
add yet another machine to the computer forensic backlog, and the investigation 
could be wrapped up immediately, rather than having to wait weeks to months for a 
completed forensic review.

that guidance on the seizure of computers containing child pornog- 
raphy be obtained from the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) 
Task Forces. This network of 46+ law enforcement agencies specializes 
in the investigation and prosecution of crimes against children facili- 
tated by computer. Additional information about ICAC can be found 
at www.icactraining.org. 
I can hear you yelling "WAIT! What if I think he might have child pornography 
on his computer?" Good question. If the warrant for the case specifies that the inves- 
tigator can search for and seize the sent e-mail in question, then it would be hard to 
justify why the investigator spent all day looking through the suspect's vacation pic- 
tures for possible images of child pornography. A warrant for the seizure of a given 
piece of information that results in the seizure of a computer, or other digital storage 
device, does not give the law enforcement agent carte blanche to look through every 
file on the computer. As it relates to the child pornography question, if the investi- 
gator believes there is evidence of child pornography on the computer, the investi- 
gator is better off obtaining a warrant for the suspected child pornography rather 
than to search for evidence of one crime under the pretenses of another crime.

Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
That is not to say there aren't instances when you may stumble across evidence 
of a different crime when reviewing digital information. Should the occasion arise 
when you are looking for one type of information under a specific warrant, and 
inadvertently find evidence of another crime, the legal guidance is that you should 
immediately stop the review and obtain a second warrant to search for evidence of 
the second crime. It is theoretically possible that you could finish examining the 
computer under the first warrant, and not specifically search for items pertaining to 
the newly discovered crime. However, that strategy is not recommended. 
But do we have the tools necessary to enable us to copy-off only the relevant 
data objects? Can this be done within a reasonable time frame? From a technologist's 
viewpoint, the technology is often more flexible than the legal framework within 
which the technology operates. The current technology allows us to search very 
rapidly through thousands of pages of information for keywords, a feat that would be 
all but impossible with paper records. But much of the specialized computer forensic 
tools are designed to be used in a forensic laboratory environment and not for on- 
scene response. These powerful forensic tools often require a fair amount of time to 
analyze and process the information on a target drive. Often, these laboratory exami- 
nations involve tools that may take hours to complete a given function, and the 
review of information often involves hours of pouring through documents and 
graphics. If we consider that "time" is one of the most limiting factors when con- 
ducting on-scene analysis, there is definitely a conflict between the best technical 
analysis that could be performed and the time frame in which a reasonable on-scene 
analysis should be completed. 
The seizure of data objects from large servers while in the course of investi- 
gating network intrusion cases is fairly common and accepted, but it is difficult to 
tell if the seizure of data objects will become more common in the everyday inves- 
tigator's response toolkit. Although there appears to be a general legal and techno- 
logical framework within which data object seizure can occur, it is still difficult to 
swallow the fact that the original evidence will be left behind. The use of this tech- 
nique on business computers and networks follows the argument that the business 
is a disinterested third party, and that if relevant data is missed, the investigator can 
go back and retrieve additional information because the business has no desire to 
interfere with the investigation. But would a spouse or roommate constitute a disin- 
terested third party with regards to data on their computer? Can we develop tools 
that give the investigator a greater level of comfort regarding the thoroughness of 
the on-scene previewing/review? These questions, and others that will spring from 
discussions like this, will shape the way in which this technique, and the other 
options presented earlier, become accepted or rejected by the digital evidence 
response community.

Use of Tools for Digital Evidence Collection 
Where the computer forensics of yesterday relied on vary basic tools that allowed 
manual manipulation of the seized data objects, we have since developed tools that 
assist in the acquisition, organization, and examination of the data. Both the ubiquity 
of electronic information and the sheer volume of seized digital information have 
necessitated the use of tools to assist in the investigative process. Hardware and soft- 
ware write blockers and hard-drive duplication devices have reduced the chances of 
damaging the information on source drives. Tools beyond simple hex editors and 
command-line scripts were developed to assist the examiner in performing keyword 
searches, sorting data objects by file type and category, and scouring the source disk 
for file remnants in file slack space and drive free space. Tools like Autopsy Browser, 
SMART, iLook, Encase, and Forensic Toolkit are dramatic departures from manual 
command-line searching and have had a significant impact on the efficiency in 
which large volumes of data are examined. These tools have also increased the acces- 
sibility of digital evidence to those outside of the closed circle of highly trained 
forensic examiners. 
The way in which digital information is analyzed has changed over the years~ 
obviously driven by the ever-increasing amount of information stored digitally. But 
other changes have been driven by the increase in our knowledge of how to work 
with digital evidence~most notably in the development of tools to assist in different 
phases of the investigative and forensic process. The use of software and hardware 
tools by on-scene responders can begin to address how we work toward achieving a 
greater level of data object seizure. Current tools, such as ImageMasster and Helix, 
begin to enable an on-scene responder to image an entire drive and to seize the 
contents of the RAM. Other tools in this domain provide some capacity to preview 
the contents of a suspect drive and to image only the necessary information, as has 
been the case for years in the incident response disciplines. 
Some will argue that no one should use a tool if they cannot explain exactly 
what the tool is doing. In the computer forensics realm, this often translates to "no 
one should use a tool if they cannot perform, by hand, the operations that the tool is 
performing." There is a fair amount of disagreement on this position. The law 
enforcement community commonly uses tools where they can explain the basic 
principal, but not the exact manner in which the tool is accomplishing its task. For 
example, when an officer is trained on the use of the radar gun, she is taught the 
principals of the Doppler Effect and how the tool records the very precise timings 
between the sending of a radar impulse and the receipt of the reflected radar energy. 
The officer would also be shown how the unit is tested and calibrated to ensure reli- 
ability. In this way, the officer understands generally how the tool works~it is not 
www.syngress.com 

112 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
reasonable to instruct them on how to construct the device, nor should the officer 
be required to manually calculate how the speed of a vehicle is determined from 
recorded radar signals in order to be a proficient operator of the tool. 
That is not to say that we should be able to use any tool without accountability. 
Tools that are used in the seizure or analysis of digital evidence must be tested. This 
testing is commonly performed by the organization using the tool~since the tool 
must be tested within the parameters of the agency's protocols~but larger tool veri- 
fication efforts are underway at the National Institute for Standards and Technology 
(NIST). NIST has created tool testing specifications for disk imaging tools, physical 
and software write blockers, and deleted file recovery programs. A number of prod- 
ucts have been tested under this program, and the results look very promising. 
Almost all of the programs or devices tested actually work as purported. That's not to 
say there are not issues with the NIST program. Technology changes faster than the 
standards development and tool testing processes, and the overall number of stan- 
dards developed through the NIST program has been, unfortunately, small. 
However, placing tools at the disposal of the greater law enforcement commu- 
nity has some significant impacts related to the overall model that we follow when 
working with digital evidence: If we are able to train officers/investigators on the 
proper use of a given tool, and the tool has passed muster through testing under a 
given protocol, whether at their local agency or at the NISTI then the officer/inves- 
tigator is empowered to take an active role in the recovery of digital evidence and in 
the investigation on the whole. 
It is clear that we do not have all the answers to the technological hurdles 
worked out, but the technology is often not the limited factor, as was discussed ear- 
lier. Understanding that the technology will forever be changing and advancing, the 
legal community must begin to play an active role in providing the technologists 
with direction and boundaries. The technologists need to heed the legal guidance, 
examine how future issues will affect law enforcement, and begin designing tools 
that will provide a critical edge to the good guys. 
Common Threads 
within Digital Evidence Seizure 
The landscape of potential seizure environments is complicated and variations are 
nearly infinite. The level of knowledge of the on-scene responders includes a wide 
range of skills and abilities. Because the seizure process will be greatly impacted by 
the particular hardware and software arrangements and knowledge of the on-scene 
responder, it is not possible to present one correct way to seize digital evidence, 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
113 
unfortunately. What does exist is a continuum of methods mapped against the com- 
plexity of the scene versus the skill of the responders. 
There are, however, basic threads that tie any seizure process together. The first 
thread is that you must be able to explain what steps you took to arrive at a partic- 
ular destination. It does not matter if you come out of a building with a floppy disk 
or an entire network, you should be able to replicate each step in the process. If you 
were presented with an exact replica of the scene, you should be able to refer to 
your notes and do everything exactly the same from arriving on-scene, to collecting 
the evidence, to walking out the door. In order to achieve this level of enlighten- 
ment, there are two sub-threads: (1) Document everything~and I mean everything. 
Have one person process the scene while the other one writes down every single, 
mind-numbing step. The documentation should be as complete as practically pos- 
sible. If one is working alone in the seizure process, consider using a voice recorder 
and narrate each step for later transcription. The exact steps taken in the process 
become doubly important if and when the target computer is manipulated in any 
way--for instance, moving the mouse to deactivate the screen-saver, or initiating a 
shutdown sequence. (2) Confucius is attributed to saying: "To know that you know 
what you know, and that you do not know what you do not know, that is true 
knowledge." Translated for relevance for the second sub-thread here, it means that if 
you don't know what you are doing (or worse, what you just did...), or aren't really 
comfortable with determining the next steps, stop, and revert to a less technical 
seizure method, or seek assistance from someone more qualified.Your knowledge 
will be judged by your ability to know what you don't know--when to stop~over 
the knowledge you do possess. 
The second thread is that you should seek the seizure method that best mini- 
mizes the digital crime scene. If you can reasonably come up with an "area"~ 
meaning drive, directory, file, and so on--where you believe the evidence will be 
located, it makes the most sense to look in that specific location for the digital evi- 
dence. Limiting or minimizing the crime scene has different implications based on 
whether the search for digital evidence is occurring on-scene, at the station, or back 
at the forensic laboratory. On-scene, minimization may include excluding profession- 
ally produced and labeled CDs from the seizure. Minimization may also include the 
use of software tools to preview the contents of a computer for a specific data 
object. Offsite minimization efforts may include searching only certain keywords or 
examining only a given file type. Even given our ability to search for and find most 
anything on a computer, we must remember that not every fact is relevant, and anal- 
yses that are 100-percent comprehensive do not exist. At the heart of minimization 
is the ability to know when to stop while looking for digital evidence. 
www.syngress.com 

114 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
The third thread is that whatever is seized as having potential evidentiary value 
must be authenticated by the court before it can be admitted into the case. The 
ability for the court to authenticate the evidence is a significant issue related to dig- 
ital evidence. Authentication is governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 901 
(28 U.S.C.), which states "The requirement of authentication or identification as a 
condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a 
finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims."The salient point of 
the definition for our discussions is that digital evidence can be authenticated by 
providing evidence that shows that it is in fact what it is purported to be. I realize 
that is a bit of cyclical logic~so let's break down the authentication process further 
for clarification. 
Evidence presented to the court can be authenticated a number of ways, 
including the identification of distinctive characteristics or by merely what type of 
evidence it is, as is the case for public records. Evidence may also be authenticated by 
way of testimony to the fact that the matter in question is what it is claimed to be. 
Courts have upheld the authentication of documents based on testimony (U.S.v. 
Long, C.A.8 [Minn.] 1988, 857 E2d 436, habeas corpus denied 928 E2d 245, certio- 
rari denied 112 S.Ct. 98,502 U.S. 828, 116 L.Ed.2d 69). 
However, in the past, computer forensics has relied less on the testimony of those 
performing the on-scene seizure and more on the testimony of the computer 
forensic technician. Where the on-scene responder would be able to testify as to 
where the hardware was located before seizure, the computer forensic technician 
would take the position to defend their laboratory techniques. The computer foren- 
sics community chose to address the authentication issue by creating exact duplicates 
of the seized digital information and proving mathematically that the copied infor- 
mation was an exact copy of the seized information~and the courts have supported 
the position that a duplicate of the information can be submitted in lieu of the orig- 
inal when it can be proved that the duplicate is the same extant as the original (U.S. 
v. Stephenson, C.A.5 [Tex.] 1989, 887 E2d 57, certiorari denied 110 S.Ct. 1151, 493 
U.S. 1086, 107 L.Ed.2d 1054). 
As it relates to our options for seizure discussed earlier, there are two salient 
points for discussion. The first is that the seized data~whether from a RAM dump 
or as a result of the creation of an image of the drive or file~may be authenticated 
by the testimony of the investigator that retrieved the evidence from the suspect 
machine. If the case involved a child pornography photograph, and the investigator 
saw the photograph during a preview, the investigator may be able to assert that the 
recovered photograph is the same photograph he saw during a preview. The second 
point is that the creation and matching of mathematical hashes provides a very high 
level of proof that the recovered data is an exact copy of the original. Although the 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
115 
best evidence rule states that the original should be provided whenever possible, U.S. 
v. Stephenson, noted earlier, shows that an exact duplicate is satisfactory when circum- 
stances limit the production of the original evidence in court. Hard drives, the most 
commonly encountered type of storage media, are mechanical devices, and all 
mechanical devices will fail at some point--perhaps after days, months, or decades~ 
but they will fail. By working off of a copy of the seized drive, and presenting the 
same in court, the investigator is reducing the chances of completely losing all of the 
data on the seized drive. Taking steps to reduce the complete loss of the digital infor- 
mation relating to the case is but one of the reasons to justify the use of exact copies 
over the original data. 
The final thread is the admissibility of the evidence. The admissibility of evi- 
dence is based on the authentication, and the authentication is based on the proof 
that the seized object is materially unchanged~proof that can be accomplished by 
showing a complete chain of custody (U. S. v. Zink, C.A.10 [Colo.] 1980, 612 E2d 511). 
For digital evidence, the proof that the data is what it purports to be and is 
unchanged has been accomplished by both testimony and use of the cryptographic 
hash algorithms. Similar to how the forensic laboratory technician uses the hash 
function to show that the entire seized drive was copied accurately, the on-scene 
responder can refer to their detailed notes to testify as to the location of the seized 
information and show that the hash functions proved that the integrity of the data 
was not compromised during imaging. 
Determining the Most 
Appropriate Seizure Method 
Clearly, there will be cases where the most appropriate action is to seize all the phys- 
ical hardware at a suspect's location. Perhaps it is the only option that the minimally 
trained responder has at their disposal. Maybe the forensic preview software didn't 
support the graphics card for the computer. It's possible that additional keyword 
searches need to be performed or items need to be carved from drive free space, and 
both would be better performed in a controlled laboratory environment. There are 
any number of reasons why the on-scene responder will choose to seize the physical 
container, and that's ok! The important point is that the most appropriate method of 
seizure is chosen to match the responder's skill level, and that it appropriately 
addresses the type of crime. 
The minimization stage may provide the investigator with the places~com- 
puters, storage media, and so on--that have the highest probability of containing the 
desired information. A preview on-scene may verify that the information exists. In 
www.syngress.com 

116 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
cases of child pornography possession, the on-scene preview may allow the investi- 
gator to take the suspect into custody right at that moment~or at least have some 
very frank discussions about the material found on the computer. The case may be 
provided to a prosecutor with just the previewed images, and discussions of sentences 
and pleas can occur immediately, instead of having to wait for a complete forensics 
examination. If the case is referred to trial, the full forensic analysis of the seized 
computer can be conducted at that time. On the other hand, maybe a full examina- 
tion of the data should be conducted to determine if the suspect has produced any 
new images of child pornography~information that is critical in determining if an 
active victimization is occurring and is critical to the overall fight against this type of 
crime. This simple scenario shows how the incremental appwach and the seizure options dis- 
cussed earlier are needed so as to even be2in to get a foothold on crimes with a cyber compo- 
nent, but that circumstances may force investig, ators to throw out the incremental approach in 
favor of a complete examination. 
There are a few other key points relating to physical seizure. The first is that the 
entire computer will be needed by the laboratory to determine the system time and 
other settings related to the motherboard. If you plan on only seizing the hard drive, 
imaging the hard drive on-scene, or only imaging relevant information, follow the 
methodology outlined by NIJ in the Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence (NIJ, 
2004) to use controlled boots to record the system time versus a trusted time source. 
The second key point is that there are many computers and laptops that do not 
allow for easy access to the hard drives~which would make any attempts to image 
on-scene impractical and, as a result, require seizure of the hardware. For example, 
some laptop designs require the majority of the laptop to be disassembled to gain 
access to the hard drive. I strongly recommend that the disassembly of laptops or 
other hardware take place in a controlled laboratory or shop environment~there are 
just way too many little pieces and screws, often with unusual head designs, to be 
attempting a disassembly on-scene. In these cases, the physical seizure of the com- 
puter itself may be required even if you came prepared to image on-scene. 
The third key point is that there may be other nondigital evidence that could 
reside with the physical computer. Items such as sticky notes can be found stuck to a 
monitor; passwords or Web addresses can be written in pencil or marker on the 
computer enclosure; or items may be taped to the bottom of a keyboard or hidden 
inside the computer itself. I remember one story of a criminal that hid his marijuana 
stash inside the computer; the wife asserted that he had child pornography on the 
computer and the computer examiner~and wife~were amazed when bags of mar- 
ijuana were found inside the computer enclosure. 
One last note: Don't turn off the investigative part of your brain while con- 
ducting the seizure. Use all the investigative techniques you learned in the academy 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
117 
and employ during the execution of physical search warrants.You will get much fur- 
ther in the case if you use information from one source (computer/suspect) to gain 
more information from the other source (suspect/computer)~but remember that 
Miranda rights may be applicable when having discussions with the suspect. 
Summary 
There is no doubt that the investigators of tomorrow will be faced with more digital 
information present in greater numbers and types of devices. Seizing the relevant 
evidentiary information is, and will continue to be, a critical step in the overall com- 
puter forensics process. The current view that the physical hardware is the evidence 
has now been joined by a different view that the information can be regarded as evi- 
dence~whether the hardware or information is viewed as evidence has a dramatic 
effect on how we "seize" or "collect" evidence both at the scene and in the forensics 
laboratory. 
A number of factors may limit the continued wholesale seizure of the physical 
hardware. The storage size of the suspect's computer hard drive or storage network 
may exceed an investigator's ability to take everything back to the forensics labora- 
tory. Full disk encryption, now released as part of the Windows Vista operating 
system, may foil an investigator's ability to recover any data without the proper 
encryption key. Further, concerns over commingled and third-party data, covered by 
the Privacy Protection Act, may impact the ability of an investigator to seize more 
data than specified in the warrant. Lastly, the increasing amount of seized digital evi- 
dence is having an effect on the ability of many of the computer forensics laborato- 
ries to complete forensic analyses in a timely manner. Both investigations and 
prosecutions may be suffering because of delays in the processing of digital evidence. 
While the existing seizure methodology is focused on the seizure of hardware, 
investigators need to be able to select the most appropriate option for seizure 
according to the situation and their level of technical expertise. There are other 
seizure options that could be considered by the digital evidence response commu- 
nity. On-site previews using Linux- or Windows-based bootable CDs allow an inves- 
tigator to review the contents of a suspect's computer in a relatively forensically 
sound manner. Techniques exist to dump the RAM of a suspect's computer to 
attempt to recover any information that may be stored in RAM but not written to 
disk, such as passwords, chat sessions, and unsaved documents. Imaging on-scene is 
yet another option available to investigators. Full disk imaging~where a complete 
bit-by-bit copy of a hard drive is created on a black drive--is more common and is 
currently used by a fair number of investigators. Less common is the imaging of 
www.syngress.com 

118 
Chapter 3 9 Seizure of Digital Information 
select data objects that have evidentiary value. While still controversial, there appears 
to be a legal and technological framework that makes the imaging of data objects a 
viable option. 
Clearly, there will always be more digital evidence than we can process within 
our existing organizational and governmental structures. More trained examiners in 
the field does not always equate to more trained examiners in the understaffed labo- 
ratories nor out in the field. The time of the most highly trained personnel is one of 
our most precious resources. There is no possible way that the limited number of 
specialists can process electronic evidence at every scene. Not only would they not 
be able to cover every scene, the laboratory work would undoubtedly suffer. In order 
to protect the time of the most highly trained and specialized people, those with less 
technical knowledge need to receive some level of training that allows them to per- 
form a number of duties normally performed by the specialist. In this way, knowl- 
edge and high-technology investigative skills are pushed-down to all levels of 
responder. That is not to say that trainingforjirst responder isn't plagued with prob- 
lems~the knowledge required to properly deploy advanced tools often exceeds the 
amount of time allotted for such training. We're caught in a Catch-22: all line offi- 
cers need to be able to seize digital evidence, but the first responder level of training 
may not fully equip the officers to seize the evidence, and the level of training 
required to more completely understand the digital evidence seizure process may 
involve multiple days of training, and multiple days of training on a single topic will 
most likely not be provided to all line officers. 
The level of training will affect the responder's use of technology, and the tech- 
nology encountered will dictate whether the responder's level of training is appro- 
priate in a given situation. There will be cases where the most appropriate action is 
to seize all the physical hardware at a suspect location. Perhaps it is the only option 
that the minimally trained responder has at their disposal, or maybe the technology 
encountered is so complex that none of the responders know exactly how to handle 
the seizure. 
As it stands now, the forensic collection and analysis system works~sometimes 
tenuously, and frequently at a snail's pace~however, we will undoubtedly continue 
to face more change: change coming in the way of new devices, higher levels of 
inter-connectivity, and the ever-increasing amounts of data storage requiring exami- 
nation. Will the existing manner in which we go about seizing and examining dig- 
ital information be sufficient in five years? Ten years? Are there changes we can 
institute now in the way we address digital evidence that will better position us to 
face the coming changes? 
I hope throughout this chapter that I made myself clear that I am not advocating 
any one seizure methodology over another~the critical take-away point is that we 

Seizure of Digital Information 9 Chapter 3 
119 
need to provide our responders with options to choose the appropriate seizure 
method based on their level of technical skill and the situation at hand. ! have found 
in my work with law enforcement in New Hamphire, as well as throughout the 
nation, that crimes that involve a computer closely map to crimes that do not 
involve a computer~all of it part of the migration of traditional crime into the dig- 
ital medium. If we expect our law enforcement agents to be responsive to traditional 
crimes with a high-technology component, we must provide them with the appro- 
priate tools and procedures to enable them to actually investigate and close a case. 
Asking investigators to send each and every case that involves a computer to a 
forensic laboratory for review is not a sustainable option. If we don't "push down" 
technical knowledge to investigators and line officers, the specialists will quickly 
become overwhelmed and investigations will grind to a halt~a situation that has 
already begun to occur across the country. 
The volume of computer forensic exams is only one factor that is driving us 
toward changing our approach to digital evidence seizure. As outlined in the pre- 
vious pages, whole disk encryption, personal data and Privacy Protection Act con- 
cerns, and massively large storage arrays are all playing a part in the move to 
minimize the amount of information seized from a suspect machine. The landscape 
is quickly changing, and designing solutions to problems of today will not prepare us 
for the challenges of tomorrow. It is hoped that the change in focus away from the 
wholesale seizure of digital storage devices and media, in the appropriate situations, 
will better prepare our law enforcement agents and private sector investigators for 
the new technologies and coming legal concerns that the future holds.

Chapter 4 9 Handheld Forensics 
Digital Forensics 
The field of digital forensics has long been centered on traditional media like hard 
drives. Being the most common digital storage device in distribution it is easy to see 
how they had become a primary point of evidence. However, as technology brings 
digital storage to more and more devices, forensic examiners have needed to prepare 
for a change in what types of devices hold a digital fingerprint. Cell phones and 
PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) devices are so common that they have become stan- 
dard in today's digital examinations. 
However, as you can see from these definitions, the scope of how they impact 
forensics is one that is very new and very different. These small devices carry a large 
burden for the forensic examiner, with different handling rules from scene to lab and 
with the type of data being as diverse as the suspects they come from. 
Handheld devices are rooted in their own operating systems, file systems, file 
formats, and methods of communication. Dealing with this creates unique problems 
for examiners. Performing a forensic exam on a cell phone or PDA takes special 
software and special knowledge of the way these devices work, as well as where pos- 
sible evidence could be stored. Having a basis of knowledge to build on in order to 
start adding these types of devices into your forensic examination will help you not 
only be more comprehensive in your methods, but also gain new insight to your 
suspect. 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
125 
What Is the Handheld Forensic Impact? 
Many people have asked me, Why is the handheld device so important in my 
forensic processing? 
My answer is somewhat simple. They are the only devices that your suspect can 
have with them at all times based on their size, and they have immediate access to 
them 24?7 because they are immediate boot cycle devices. In addition, these are the 
devices that typically hold all our dirty little secrets with colorful pictures and 
descriptive text messages. They are a vault of evidence for the forensic examiner. A 
lot of handheld devices are traded on popular auction sites online as people are 
always looking for the latest gadget they can show off. We gathered a variety of these 
devices for testing purposes and found that 80 percent of them retained the user's 
information on the device. The information ranged from complete address books, 
work related e-mails, to pictures that were of intimate moments. Surprisingly as we 
contacted the people who belonged to the devices most of them had no idea that 
the data was retained on the device, let alone recoverable. Dirty little secrets were 
ripe for the taking for a trained forensic examiner. 
These things make it so the handheld devices can carry some of the most crucial 
pieces of evidence in your forensic examination. The digital fingerprint on a hand- 
held device is much larger than most assume. 
So now that we know how important a device can be in forensic processing, it is 
important to have a good understanding of how handheld forensics impacts the four 
main foundations of digital forensics. 
Digital Forensic Foundations 
A sound forensic foundation is no different than other forensic foundations when 
dealing with handheld devices: 
1. Evidence Collection 
2. 
Evidence Preservation 
3. 
Analysis 
4. 
Reporting 
These foundations are the core to dealing with all types of traditional digital 
devices. However, when it comes to the nontraditional devices like handhelds, these 
foundations change regarding how a forensic examiner would apply them. 
There are certain levels of groundwork that have to be put into play to establish 
these foundations. The easiest way to understand and bring handheld forensics into

your examination process is to compare and contrast what digital forensics has been 
dealing with for years in regard to hard drives and media, and show how handheld 
forensics are different. Table 4.1 breaks down each area of traditional forensics vs. the 
nontraditional in the areas of storage through examination.

Hard Drive and Media Forensics~Storage device requiring a file system 
9 
Handheld Forensics~Embedded system device 
As you can see, data on a handheld device is stored and handled differently from that 
on a hard drive. A hard drive has static memory, but a handheld device has active 
memory; a hard drive has large storage capacity, but a handheld device has very lim- 
ited storage capacity; and so on. Because of this, the forensic processing of the data 
must be handled differently. Typically you will seize a hard drive or other piece of 
media and you know it will contain data associated with one of a few different file 
systems. These file systems can range from FAT, NTFS, to EXT2, but the base prin- 
ciple is the same; a file system manages the data. 
Handheld devices are designed differently. They might have items associated or 
attached to them that have file systems, like media cards. But overall the data itself 
is bound to the actual device to gain its structure. To clarify, according to 
whatis.com, an embedded system is some combination of computer hardware and 
software, either fixed in its capability or programmable. It is specifically designed 
for a particular type of application device. The impact of this design in forensics is 
dramatic because the tools the examiner uses must understand not only the oper- 
ating system on the device that chooses how the data is stored, but also the design 
of the device to the chip set level to gauge how much storage is available on the 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
127 
device. Beyond this, the tool must understand how to communicate with the 
device in order to gain access at a low enough level to acquire all data available on 
that device for evaluation. 
An excellent example of this can be found in the earlier Palm OS PDA 
devices. These devices typically used a type of Dragonball processor as one of the 
main components on the device. This processor would determine the true capacity 
of the ROM (Read Only Memory) section of the device. The operating system 
would see a size that was reflected as smaller than what was actually writable to 
the device by the processor. The processor would set the size of memory allocation 
for the operating system to see, when in fact the device had more usable space that 
could be used by the savvy user. For the forensic examiner, it was crucial they used 
tools that would be able to communicate to the processor itself as opposed to the 
OS on the device in order to get all the potential evidence from the unit. The 
embedded nature of the device is what causes the extra steps to go into effect with 
the forensic processing. 
Static versus Active 
9 
Hard Drive and Media Forensics~Device is static 
9 
Handheld Forensics~Device is active 
When we say a device is static we do not mean that the device does not have the 
ability to change. Static means that, after the proper forensic procedure has been per- 
formed and followed, the device itself has no risk of changing while seized. In hard 
drive and media forensic a variety of different write protection devices are used to 
prevent this static state from changing. However, with a handheld device it is active 
even after proper seizure protocols have been followed. 
To best understand the handheld device, I have always compared it to a very 
popular game, Tetris. The object of the game is to match up blocks into a solid line 
design that then disappears from the display. The handheld device is somewhat sim- 
ilar as it is actively moving around data on the device to form solid lines of storage 
to ensure optimal use of its limited storage capabilities. This active system is part of 
what makes the handheld devices harder to deal with in forensics. 
In addition, a vast majority of handheld devices are also active wireless points 
ranging from the different cellular communication networks, to Bluetooth, to 
802.11. They are all actively receiving some type of data. This makes the preservation 
foundation of forensics increasingly difficult, but not impossible as we will see 
walking through the seizure of these devices later.

Chapter 4 9 Handheld Forensics 
Storage Capacity Differences 
9 
Hard Drive and Media Forensics~Large built-in capacity 
9 
Handheld Forensics~Smaller on-board capacity 
If there is one thing that has impacted the field of digital forensics more than any- 
thing else, it would have to be the dramatic change in cost and capacity of storage. It 
used to be that a gigabyte of storage would have cost around $5.00 per gigabyte. 
Now, at times, it is under $1.00 per gigabyte. The average consumer has gone from a 
standard hard drive of 8 gigabytes in size to not being able to find a drive under 80 
gigabytes. This is 10 times the growth that was expected, and has made some 
paradigm shifts occur with hard drive and media processing. Besides the processing 
power needed to create a forensic image of the staggering amounts of ham drive 
space available to the average consumer, the man hours and ability to sift through 
the mountains of data associated with this much storage has become almost impos- 
sible to combat. 
Handheld devices also have changed in their capacity, but not at the same dra- 
matic rates as hard drives. Their on-board capacities have increase from 8 megabytes 
to over a gigabyte based on the storage structure of the device, which has had a 
huge impact on these small devices. Don't heave a sigh of relief with these small 
capacities, however. The counter to this is that the handheld systems require less 
space for one file than a hard drive would. The change is back to the core with the 
file systems on the devices and how they function. If you are never given a large 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
129 
space to live in you will find the most efficient method of using it. Since hard drives 
have always been larger, they have never had to account for their data as closely as 
that on the handheld device. Storage may be a race to see who can store what in a 
certain size, but the power will still remain in how the data will be put to this 
storage. 
Imaging Techniques 
9 
Hard Drive and Media Forensics~Forensic acquisition: Bitstream image 
9 
Handheld Forensics~Forensic acquisition: Active memory image 
This is probably the largest point of comparison and the one that is the hardest to 
comprehend for the seasoned forensic examiner. 
Bitstream image is considered to be a bit-for-bit copy of all data associated with 
the media device, including all allocated and unallocated data. 1 This is a fundamental 
difference between a forensic image and a backup image that might be made using 
conventional software. The other fundamental difference is that a forensic image is 
verifiable and can be rechecked for accuracy. 
Active memory image is similar to a bitstream image as it is copying allocated 
and unallocated data. Where it differs from a traditional bitstream image is that there 
is more data available on the device either reserved by the manufacturer or 
encrypted and locked from access, making it inaccessible to the examiner. These 
unique characteristics are where you see the properties associated with imaging the 
devices change. Another reason it is referred to as an active memory image is based 
on the fact the data itself is constantly moving and being reallocated. This prevents 
the verification step of the hash value from serving the same purpose. It is still verifi- 
cation to an image; however, it is a verification of an image at just one point and 
time. Another way to think of this type of image is through the term snapshotforen- 
sics. A snapshot of the device is taken and that is the point of verification for the 
examiner.This is discussed further later in the chapter. 
Evidence Collection 
Collection is a very sensitive area for forensics because if this stage is not handled 
properly the rest of the forensic process is not needed. Good collection tools and 
techniques are crucial to having good viable forensic evidence. 
The basic rules of collection are somewhat simple in regards to handhelds: 
1. Always know what you are looking for. This comes to point a lot with 
handheld devices. There is a very diverse range of devices that can easily 
blend into the environment. Cell/mobile phones in particular are designed 
r 
www.syngress.com 

130 
Chapter 4 9 Handheld Forensics 
to be almost a digital chameleon. Devices are now starting to look like 
everyday items such as pens, watches, and even makeup cases. The potential 
is endless and with so many different things to look for, our digital collec- 
tion process just has gotten harder. 
The phone shown in Figure 4.1 is a good an example of how modular 
devices have become: a multiposition camera was a major selling point for 
this particular device.

Always remember, multiple points of evidence are available. Handheld 
devices are rarely seen alone. Most of the time they will be seized as acces- 
sories to larger desktop or laptop systems. However, we now even acces- 
sorize our accessories. Figure 4.2 shows an example of a standard handheld 
media card. Notice the form factor being smaller then a fingerprint. 
However, the fingerprint it holds can make or break a case.

In addition to the digital points of evidence, it is important to remember that 
biological evidence also exists. With handheld devices, especially with the excessive 
contact, they have the suspects biological "ports," imprints of the suspect's person can 
still be found on the devices. Always handle with care and consult a specialist in the 
appropriate forensic discipline for forensic advice associated with the collection and 
handling. 
Taking these somewhat simple collection principles and applying them for 
everyone that gets involved in the collection process can be very difficult. Most of 
the time, digital evidence is now collected in the field by what have come to be 
known as first responders. 
First Responder 
Typically, first responders are not directly trained in the field of digital evidence, so it 
is important to get them the basic procedures and protocols to best provide a 
forensic lab with the most viable evidence. However, doing so in a manner that is 
applicable to their skills and interests is somewhat difficult. To make things easier for 
most first examiners when dealing with handheld evidence, the handling and collec- 
tion process has been broken down by device type. This is a very general method 
but has been found to be helpful to make sure the proper handling is done.

Collection to Handling 
With handheld devices, the first interaction with the device can be the most crucial. 
To understand the crucial points of handling associated with each handheld device, 
they have been broken down here into step-by-step instructions. 
PDA Handling 
I. 
Maintain the power on the device. The power on the device is what allows 
the device to maintain the data associated with it. Most of the PDA devices 
maintain potential evidence in RAM (random access memory) and, 
without power, this memory is cleared on the device. There are a variety of 
devices that are now designed to help maintain power to a handheld device

without a physical power supply. Most of these devices are battery powered 
and can be purchased through a forensic software provider or through a 
retail store. 
Figure 4.7 shows an example of one of the commercially available 
power supplies for phones and PDA devices. The different tips can be 
attached based on the model. 
Figure 4.7 A Commercially Available Power Supply for Phones and PDA 
Devices 
2. 
Gather all accessories, manuals, cables, and such. Remember that even our 
accessories have accessories nowadays, and it is important that all items that 
can potentially be associated with the devices are gathered as well. There 
are a lot of accessories that will affect the device's ability to run without 
them being present. It is important to remember that when in doubt you 
should take it with you. 
3. Wireless devices need special handling. With all wireless devices, it is 
important to remember that you have to do your best to block the wireless 
signal from connecting to the device. This is discussed more in the cellular 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
135 
evidence handling section. However, some PDA devices do have the ability 
to turn the wireless functionality off through a simple switch or through 
the device interface. Depending on what type of device you are working 
with, this does have a risk of changing data on the device; it is recom- 
mended to follow the Faraday rules that are associated with cellular device 
handling as the best practice. 
Cellular Handling 
o 
Maintain power on the device. Most cellular devices are not as power 
dependent as the PDA device is, however they can also be sensitive to 
power. Power helps the device maintain the last state it was left in by your 
suspect, so for example if your suspect has entered a PIN code into the cell 
phone, the device will remain authenticated as long as you maintain the 
same state on the device. 
2. 
Control the wireless to the device. Wireless access of a cellular device can 
create a rather tricky situation when dealing with it in the field. If the 
device is still actively receiving signals from the tower, there is a risk that 
additional phone calls, text messages, or even damaging applications from 
another source involved could be received by the phone, which all could 
ruin your potential evidence. To protect the device from these types of 
risks, the use of Faraday technology typically is deployed. The principle of a 
Faraday device is to act as a cage for wireless signals. The Faraday cage will 
cause the signals from the device to bounce back onto the device, pre- 
venting it from escaping. Figure 4.8 is an example of a first responder bag 
for handheld devices that acts as a Faraday cage. 
3. 
There are other options besides commercial bags that can be used as a 
Faraday cage by first responders, but depending on the type of materials 
used and the type of device it is enclosing, you will receive varying results.

4. 
Gather all potential accessories. When in doubt, teach first responders to 
take anything and everything. There are a large variety of accessories that 
are designed to connect or communicate with a cell phone When in 
doubt, it is always better to seize the device and sort through these acces- 
sories in a controlled lab environment to determine their forensic viability. 
5. 
Cellular devices have a very unique seizure issue associated with their 
cables. Each cellular cable can be proprietary or unique to the device. So, if 
the cable is available on scene it is strongly recommended that it be seized. 
There are excellent third-party cable kits (see Figures 4.9 and 4.10) that 
have been put together by forensic as well as commercial companies that 
are also recommended to be part of your standard lab equipment.

The preceding guidelines are based on available testing and devices that were 
available when this publication was put together. As technology evolves, so will the 
techniques required to deal with that technology in forensics. 
Evidence Preservation 
Typically, the preservation stage is associated with the actual processing of the evi- 
dence. Each forensic examiner will process evidence in a different manner since they 
www.syngress.com 

138 
Chapter 4 9 Handheld Forensics 
were taught or based on their own organization's associated standard operating pro- 
cedures. Following is a list of guidelines to follow in evidence preservation to aid in 
the proper process despite the type of tool that is used. 
Preservation is based primarily on retaining consistent results that are verifiable 
through method and end content. This part of processing is what makes digital 
forensics more than just the use of software but the formulation of a process. The 
following are recommendations for establishing a proper preservation process in a lab 
environment. 
Maintain the Device 
The device will always be in an active, volatile state and it is important that as little 
information as possible change on that device. Once a device arrives in a lab, it is 
important that it be checked for power and to make sure the wireless signal, if appli- 
cable, is still being blocked. For most lab environments, it would be difficult to make 
the entire lab a Faraday cage so smaller Faraday devices typically are used~see 
Figure 4.11. 
Figure 4.11 The StrongHold Box Is an Excellent Lab Tool for Processing 
Cell and PDA Devices 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
139 
These types of devices are more convenient than using a bag system once the 
device itself is required to interact with a computer system for a forensic acquisition. 
Part of maintaining a device is also having a realistic expectation of what can be 
maintained. One of the differences between processing a static digital evidence item 
such as a hard drive and processing an active item such as a handheld device is that 
the active item will have the risk of the hash verification changing. The hash verifi- 
cation that typically is done at the end of the acquisition process is used to prove 
that the process is repeatable and to mathematically prove that the data has not 
changed. However, with handheld devices the system is constantly actively processing 
data and there is a risk that the data itself might change. This change would then also 
affect the hash value. This is where the step of maintaining the device comes into 
play. Once an acquisition is completed, the device acquisition file can be verified and 
the analysis stage can begin. At the end of the analysis stage, a reverification of the 
data that has already been acquired can be performed and then that can be used to 
show that the analysis process did not affect the acquisition file. This is commonly 
referred to as snapshot forensics. Imagine the shift in paradigms that would need to 
take place for the traditional hard drive forensic examiner who has always based 
examinations on the basis that data is static and does not change without being 
altered by an outside force. 
Maintain a Forensic Data Connection 
There are a lot of different methods by which a handheld device can talk to another 
device. Cables, Bluetooth, IrDA are a few, but a lot of these connection options also 
hold pitfalls for the forensic examiner. Sometimes the easiest option for connection to 
a device can be a Bluetooth or IrDA connection; however, these connections are not 
considered to be traditionally forensic either. Both of these types of connections allow 
for an open communication port on the evidence device. Once this port is open, a 
variety of things can happen to the device. An example of this is with a typical 
Bluetooth connection on a phone (see Figure 4.12).The connection opens the device 
to be modified by programs that call through that communication port. The write 
protection through some of the wireless options is not available, forcing a hard posi- 
tion for a forensic examiner. Can they verify with absolute certainty that no one else 
utilized that open communication method to alter the evidence? For some devices, 
this is the only communication method available and this acts as a short level justifica- 
tion. Most devices, however, have other options that are considered to be more foren- 
sically sound. Cable communication is always best for connection in a forensic 
acquisition with a handheld device because it maintains the device better. It also is 
verifiable in court based on the communication protocols written for the device and 
cable.

Forensic Grade Tools 
There are many tools that are available in the commercial market for handheld data 
use. These tools vary in function from phone book downloads to ring tone transfer 
tools and each have their place in consumers' toolkits. However, the use of commer- 
cial tools that have not been forensically validated in handheld forensics can be a 
dangerous game. 
1. Always test your tool and make sure you have a verification method in 
place for the data it provides. 
2. 
Check the source of your tool; make sure it comes from a provider that is 
willing to support you in court. 
3. 
Understand your tool's limits and what it was designed to do. Never rely on 
just one tool for all your examinations. The use of a primary and secondary 
tool is always recommended to make sure you receive the best evidence 
possible. 
Preservation is about a process and a process is simply thinking through what 
you need to accomplish and making sure the road you take is the best one. With all 
handheld devices, there will be many deviants in the road that will frustrate and 

Handheld Forensics 9 Chapter 4 
141 
annoy any examiner, but the evidence they provide can make or break a case with 
something as simple as a text message. 
Analysis and Reporting 
Analysis and reporting is based primarily on the tools that are used by your partic- 
ular lab. Before starting any examination process, I always have recommended to find 
out as much as possible about what you are about to examine. When dealing with 
handheld devices, there are a couple very good Web resources that will allow you to 
look up information on the particular devices so you will have a better under- 
standing of what you can expect in your evidence: 
www.phonescoop.com 
www.wireless-forensics, com 
www.phonefinder, com 
Details on particular tools can be found in other manuscripts or from the manu- 
facturers themselves. 
Summary 
Handheld forensics is more than just a new forensic discipline; it is a new lifestyle 
choice for the field of digital forensics. With new devices coming out every day and 
more and more of the population switching to the handheld addiction, this area of 
digital evidence will only grow and expand with time.

Chapter 5 9 RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 
Introduction 
The year was 1949 and the author George Orwell presented a chilling view of a 
future society, one where the Ministry of Truth works in the service of Big Brother, 
the ruler of a society not all that unfamiliar to people today. This chapter will focus 
on RFID technology and discuss the adoption of this well-intended technology, and 
the gradual eroding of acceptable usage until undesirable fringe implementations are 
possible. 
RFID technology offers a method for a unique identifier or other prepro- 
grammed information to be transmitted to a receiving station upon request. 
Background 
Radio frequency identification (P,.FID) has been with us for quite a while. Airplanes 
are monitored and can be controlled through the use of RFID technology. 
Electronic door locks have been available for many years implementing RFID tech- 
nology, either alone or in a multifactor implementation. Although P, FID technology 
was initially about inventory control, its functionality and applications have expanded 
significantly. And though the initial effort was to develop a cost-effective technology 
to allow for the tracking of a resource or inventory, current implementations go 
much further. 
Early computer systems were designed to do a particular task. The UNIX system 
evolved through the concept that applications can be built using tools, with each 
tool designed to optimally perform a specific function. As the list of available tools 
grew, even greater efficiencies occurred. One of the results is that UNIX systems 
eventually were constructed using tools, such as the C language, which was designed 
on other UNIX systems. 
The Internet was not designed by a central committee. It evolved~mutated may 
be a more appropriate term~by separate people and organizations building on the 
ideas of each other. The more it grew, the more evident the need for standards 
became. To influence standards, companies contributed resources to solving chal- 
lenges in areas that best suited their needs. As with most other evolution processes, 
the stronger implementations survived and the weaker ones were cannibalized or fell 
to the forgotten sidelines. 
For the purposes of this document, the term resource will be used when referring 
to anything being tracked, animate or inanimate. Resources may include objects or 
people. An interrogator is a device having the minimal function to query a resource 
for some sort of message designed for further processing.

Early Implementations 
Success or failure in business can be tied to the ability to control costs. Fixed costs 
are those over which there is little control. Discretionary costs are those that can be 
controlled in such a way as to affect the bottom line. Unsold product represents a 
cost that has not yet created a return in the investment. Therefore, the ideal situation 
has a company position sufficient product in the distribution chain so that it is avail- 
able for timely customer distribution, while minimizing the amount of product in 
the same supply chain. In order to accomplish this, accurate counts of product are 
necessary. Throughout history, product counts frequently became less accurate as 
time passed, necessitating periodic recounts. In many cases, this inventory process 
would have to be performed outside the scope of the normal business day, and fre- 
quently occurred at a time when the enterprise was entirely shut down. 
Manual Inventory 
Manual inventory is a time- and effort-intensive process where the number of 
resources are counted manually so that an assessment can be made for a number of 
reasons, to include financial investment in "on hand stock." 
Bar Codes 
This method uses a system where a code, using magnetic ink, scannable characters, 
or an optically recognizable code, is printed on a resource. A typical function for this 
coding method allows for item counts to be decremented and for restocking of the 
items sold upon sale. Disadvantages of this method of control are that: 
9 
Much of the.process is still manual. 
9 
It is easy to bypass. 
9 
It provides one way, write-once transfer of information. 
Global Source Tagging 
This method uses an inventory control system where Electronic Article Surveillance 
(EAS) devices are attached to a resource with a purpose of reducing the risk of 
shoplifting. Tags frequently are attached to the internal package as part of the 
assembly process. These tags typically are located within a sealed product, typically 
directly behind the UPC barcode and parallel to the UPC bars. The tag is designed 
to activate a sensor when it passes within close proximity of the scanning device. 
These tags typically are disabled at the point of sale by use of a magnetic field.

Chapter 5 9 RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 
Current RFID Implementations 
As the technology improves, a wide variety of challenges are being dealt with using 
vastly differing methods, all centering on a resource-interrogator design to query the 
resource. Beyond that, vastly differing solution features and enhancements were made 
to suit individual project requirements, as shown by the following examples. 
All airplanes use a transponder, designed to transmit an identification code to a 
receiver for resource management purposes, in this case, air traffic management and 
control. High technology traffic management signs are being installed in many 
metropolitan areas. If you look close, you will see both an observation camera and a 
1KFID sensor used. This is done by reading a vehicle's EasyPASS or similar type 
device. 
Unidirectional Information Flow 
The air traffic transponder system, as just mentioned, is an example of a resource 
transmitting either fundamentally fixed, but ultimately changeable information. 
Air Force One 
An example of a need for a plane to change its transponder identification code 
occurs with Air Force One (AF1), the plane used by the President of the United 
States. 
In this case, the identification of AF1 moves to whatever plane the president 
happens to be traveling on, superseding its own code; therefore the code sent can be 
manually adjusted. 
Bidirectional Information Flow 
Since RFID chips are full computers, including storage, the information stored 
within these tiny devices can be changed as the resource flows through the system. 
As with any other computer providing services, proper care should be exercised in 
providing the data. Whether provided by a mainframe or an R.FID device, the same 
controls should be in place for accessing the data. 
RFID Purposes 
RFID systems support the tracking of resources. The purpose is to instantly see what 
is occurring in your supply chain, be it inventory or people, and empower you to 
make smarter decisions. 

RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 9 Chapter 5 
147 
Major industry players such as Wal-Mart, the U.S. Department of Defense 
(DOD), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) strongly encourage 
top suppliers to implement RFID technology within delivered products. This tech- 
nology allows for tracking of resources throughout all or part of their lifecycle. 
The fundamental purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted 
upon interrogation. The data typically is used to track the location of a resource as it 
moves through its lifecycle. Its movement during the lifecycle will have a direct 
impact on a wide variety of management systems such as resource location, and 
financial control systems. Every resource that is part of an RFID system has an entire 
computer, though very small, attached to it. 
History tends to repeat itself. As we examine RFID, we will examine it through 
adherence to best security practices and generally accepted industry standards as applied to 
the seven layers of the OSI model. 
Inventory Tracking 
It is said that money is power, and those investing the money are currently control- 
ling the direction in which RFID is going. RFID is not being implemented because 
companies want to incur the additional expense of tagging each item at a cost 
upward of one dollar per item tagged. It is viewed as a way to manage cost through 
managing resources. 
Where Does RFID Fit In? 
RFID is the key to comprehensive resource tracking and management. The financial 
advantages are becoming more evident with significant increases in the number of 
uses for the technology. As the technology grows, the need for international stan- 
dards and guidance will become increasingly more evident in much the same way as 
the Internet grew as a critical resource. What the Internet did to packet transit, 
RFID will do to resource management and tracking. Systems that provide RFID- 
based services will be integrated to provide a worldwide linkage of just about every 
resource or asset on the planet. As we move forward, extreme care should be taken 
because this can be a double-edged sword along the lines of Orwell's timelessly 
written 1949 book, occurring just a little later than its title 1984, and unfolding 
today.

Technology Involved 
How RFID Works 
The simplest description of how RFID works is that a radio transmitter sends a mes- 
sage to a radio receiver. These two radios communicate on an agreed-to frequency 
within the spectrum of all wavelengths. The following paragraphs provide a func- 
tional overview of the parts within a typical implementation ofRFID. 
  DTE 
Remember that RFID technology will likely be a part of a more expan- 
sive system, which will interconnect with further reaching systems and 
clients in many cases. 
Parts of an RFID System 
An 1KFID system is made of the same parts as most other information technology 
systems. In this chapter, we will be focusing on the part of the system that: 
9 
Stores the initial information to be passed 
9 
Uses a radio as the information transport medium 
A typical RFID system includes much the same as most other IT systems, espe- 
cially since it frequently interfaces with many other applications and systems. The 
typical RFID system includes:

The TAG 
The TAG is composed of a microcomputer attached to an antenna.All input/output 
(IO) is performed through the antenna, tLFID antennas relay the Electronic Product 
Code (EPC) information from cases and pallets to RFID readers. 
Various models are available to meet portal, conveyor, and shelf installations. 
TAGs are designed so that they can be deactivated. This is intended to be done at a 
point of sale or equivalent. Compromised tags have been known to be deactivated 
prior to the end of their lifecycle. 
Tags can be: 
9 
Sewn into clothes 
9 
Integrated within product labels 
9 
ID cards 
[] 
Money 
m 
Implanted within animals and people 
TAG Readers 
tLFID readers provide exceptional flexibility in RFID design: 
9 
High read rates 
9 
Multiprotocol 
9 
Multifrequency capabilities 
They are useful in a wide variety of environments including dock doors, con- 
veyor systems, stock rooms, smart shelf applications. 
SCFPCr 
The server is a device that the tag reader passes the received information to for pro- 
cessing by software. 
Middleware 
This typically canned software prepares the received messages for downstream 
processing. 
Application Software 
This is where most os the actual work is performed. It is at this layer where most 
controls should be in place to validate the information received. The application may

Chapter 5 9 RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 
include many other tools such as databases for preparation for the primary purpose 
to be achieved. 
RFID Security from a Functional Perspective 
Securing RFID should be similar to securing almost any other platform or tech- 
nology, new or old. Guarding an asset starts with designing the protection in with 
the system as it is built. Unfortunately, in a desire to showcase functionality and 
additional features, controls are not implemented until after the project or tech- 
nology is up and running. This results in piecemeal efforts being applied, as opposed 
to a comprehensive protection initiative being incorporated right from the start. 
Can R.FID Be Used for Security? 
RFID technology can be used for security in a number of ways. For example, RFID 
badges can be used for access to unlock a door. 
Advantages of this technology are: 
9 Ease of use 
9 
Tacking based on something you have 
9 Event logging can be enabled 
Disadvantages are: 
9 
One factor authentication 
9 
Can't tell who really accessed, unless accompanied with video surveillance 
9 
Doors typically are managed by a non-IT department called building man- 
agement. 
Although the overall system should be under the control of building manage- 
ment, seldom is direct access allowed to the organization responsible for security.

his own personal ventures. He used the unmonitored, unlogged, back 
door to relocate the assets. 
Can RFID, in and of Itself, Function Securely? 
The answer is yes, but with a number of caveats. If your P,.FID implementation is 
nothing more than a chip responding with a value when in the presence of an induc- 
tion field (for power), you have large areas for concern. The answer is the same as if 
you can secure an environment by providing a layer 3 solution. The time has come 
for more global standards and independent certification of the specific product used. 
iiii!iiiiiiiii!:i What if a radio transmitter either resends the same message, or 
~ 
worse, sends multiple deceptive messages? Ah, the simple elegance of 
~'~'~i! 
electronic warfare! 
Can Systems Implemented 
Using RFID Technology Be Secure? 
The answer is yes. Again, the answer comes with the caveat that the system is only as 
secure as the sum of its parts. No wait, it is much easier than that~the system can 
be secure if the protection is end-to-end and does not lose integrity or is not subject 
to tampering while in transit over any and all transports used. Therefore the answer 
is that, as with many other information protection solutions, strong originator-to-appli- 
cation authentication is necessary to establish the validity of the sender, and an appro- 
priate level of encryption is necessary to safeguard that being sent or stored. 
Spy Chips or Consumer Value Tags? 
Is it a bug or is it a feature? Is Internet SPAM unwanted junk or is it of great value 
to someone? Who is empowered to make those decisions? 
On one hand, it may be convenient just to grab a product off the shelf and walk 
out the door. On the other hand, how do you feel about advertising being targeted 
to you and your "E-profile as you walk through a store"? What would you think if, 
as you walk through with your new date, most of your targeted ads were for bail 
bond services?

Chapter 5 9 RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 
The Electronic Product Code (EPC), 
an RFID Specification/Standard 
The AutoID Center, having performed much of the original work, closed its doors 
in September 2003 with EPCGlobal being set up to continue its work of commer- 
cializing EPC technology. EPC Class 1KFID labels offer long read ranges and are 
suitable for supply chain environments. Data can be written to Class 1 labels, 
whereas Class 0 labels are read-only. 
EPC Generation 1 
This early generation is basically the equivalent of a wireless barcode. It is easily 
spoofable and replayable. Systems implementing this standard appear to be suscep- 
tible to the greatest number of attacks, from replay through spoofing and high power 
radio transmission. 
EPC Generation 2 
This is the current standard, with features that are believed to cause increased risk. 
EPC Generation 3 
This is a significantly improved standard, adding authentication and encryption to 
the TAG-Inquisitor data path. 
RFID Frequencies 
Each RFID implementation runs on a specific frequency that was specifically 
selected based on the optimum characteristics of that frequency. These are typically 
short-range, low-powered TAG-Inquisitor pairs that tend to operate on frequency 
bandwidth chunks reserved for research. Many governments have regulated frequency 
allocation with vast differences existing. The result is that worldwide, a wide variety 
of standards and implementations currently exist, resulting in compatibility issues at 
the heart of a technology designed to seamlessly integrate resource movements. 
On a special note, since all frequencies can be disrupted through sending inter- 
ference (jamming), the reliability of the messages can be affected. A good application 
can frequently determine that an error has occurred in processing and reinterrogate. 
This functionality is typically an application layer function.

Low Frequency (LF) Band 
Characteristics of a LF band include the following: 
9 
Frequency Bandwidth: 30-300 Kilohertz 
9 
Most common RFID range: 125-134 Kilohertz 
9 
Operating distance: < 3 feet 
Typical uses are for access control and payments. LF devices work well when 
implanted in humans and animals because LF R.FID TAGS in many ways are resis- 
tant to shielding. They are not typically used for tagging objects (resources) for 
movement. 
High Frequency (HF) Band 
Characteristics of a HF band include the following: 
9 
Frequency Bandwidth: 3-30 Megahertz 
9 
Most common P, FID range: 13.56 Megahertz 
9 
Operating distance: < 3 feet 
Typical uses of a HF band are, for example, when many items are in close prox- 
imity. It works well with liquids and metals.

Frequency-Based Information Protection Concerns 
Radio frequencies are subject to jamming, where another signal appears on the same 
frequency or bandwidth specifically designed to disable communications. 
Interference caused by any one of a number of possible means can also provide dis- 
ruption of transmission if some sort of error correction methodology is not in place. 
The lack of international standards keeps a uniform solution from being recom- 
mended at the present time. Summing up frequency concerns, there are three main 
factors~speed, accuracy, and distance.You can have only two out of the three in 
most implementations.

Characteristics of Active RFID Systems 
Basically, active RFID systems involve tags that transmit at all times, typically because 
they operate on their own power. Active systems frequently transmit greater distances 
and at all times. 
Characteristics of Passive RFID Systems 
Passive RFID implementations involve a TAG that typically receives its power 
through induction. Since power is received in this manner from the inquisitor, the 
response will typically be one designed for short distance reception, based on the 
characteristics of the radio spectrum (frequency) used. 
Table 5.3 compares the characteristics of active and passive RFID systems.

user to rewrite the data stored within an RFID chip. This tool requires an RFID 
reader and a PC. Retail fraud is a concern for the misuse of this tool. Additional 
information on this tool can be found at www.rf-dump.org.

Authorizing Access to Program an RFID Chip 
An RFID chip is similar to any other computer and as such warrants the use of 
identification using strong one-time password technology. Like any other access con- 
trol process, the entire data path used within the authentication process should be 
encrypted.

US Patent Application 20020165758 
Identification and tracking of persons using RFID-tagged items 
Abstract: 
A method and system for identifying and tracking persons using 
RFID-tagged items carried on the persons. 
Previous purchase records for each person who shops at a retail 
store are collected by POS terminals and stored in transaction 
database. When a person carrying or wearing items having RFID 
tags enters the store or other designated area, a RFID tag 
scanner located therein scans the RFID tags on that person and 
reads the RFID tag information. The RFID tag information col- 
lected from the person is correlated with transaction records 
stored in the transaction database according to known correla- 
tion algorithms. 
Based on the results of the correlation, the exact identity of the 
person or certain characteristics about the person can be deter- 
mined. This information is used to monitor the movement of the 
person through the store or other areas. 
Authority to Monitor RFID Transmissions 
Only the future will give the answer to these questions, typically through challenges to 
lawful use. Who of the following will gain authority to monitor P, FID transmissions?

RFID Chip Placement 
The RFID chip typically is placed in close proximity to the bar code on the 
package. When attached as a labeled barcode, it can most frequently be found on the 
underside of the barcode label. 
A Few RFID Uses 
The following items outline just a few of the uses for this exciting technology. 
Additional uses will be referenced elsewhere within this chapter. 
Passports (Passive) 
Effective October 2006, all U.S. passports will include a 1KFID chip including, but 
not necessarily limited to name, nationality, sex, date of birth, place of birth, and dig- 
itized photograph of the passport holder. 
Public Transportation Passes (Active, battery operated) 
A common use is a public transportation pass system (e.g., EZ-Pass, FasTrak, etc.), 
where an 1KFID transmitter typically is located on the windshield of a vehicle. As the 
vehicle passes a toll scanner, the toll amount is deducted from the users account 
automatically. Look to see tokens of this type being used at commercial fast food 
establishments in the near future. 
ARNING 
Be aware that these cards are monitored without prior warning at 
many other locations, such as traffic management sites along the 
highway. Next time you are a passenger under a high tech traffic sign, 
examine it for cameras, RFID readers, and so on. it is likely just a 
matter of time until tickets are generated based on RFID technology 
calculations

Exxon Mobil SpeedPass (Active) 
This is an 1KFID implementation initially used for paying for gas services.You will 
see its technology used in a variety of additional devices in the future, such as bank 
cards. 
Conference Badges (Passive) 
Many conferences now issue you an ID badge equipped with 1KFID technology. 
This badge may include lots of information at the discretion of the conference 
provider. Each time you move by a vendor booth, your information is passed to their 
scanner to become part of their database. 
Tagging People as Resources (Passive) 
One planned place for tagging people with an 1KFID chip is on their hands (the 
chip would be place in between the person's thumb and index finger). 
Cow Chips (Passive) 
Help track the origins and path the product has taken to slaughter. This technology 
has proven very useful in tracking problems with the food supply. 
Cadaver Chips (Passive) 
Cadaver chips are gaining popularity in that a chip can be placed with each resource 
so that in the event that a need exists to identify the cadaver at a later time, it can be 
done. At some future time, this may be the chip that contains the person's history. 
Smart Shelves 
The use of smart shelves will allow you to take an item off the shelf and walk out 
the store exit with it. Billing is automatic, and the item is automatically reordered. 
Security TAG Concerns 
Altering the Identity of Goods 
Mthough shoplifting has been a concern throughout history, advances in technology 
lead people to rely more on the technology and less on the item being stolen. In 
many cases tags can be moved from one item to another so that the item being 
scanned will identify as a less costly item, therefore allowing the item to be removed

Chapter 5 9 RFID: An Introduction to Security Issues and Concerns 
while appearing to be legitimately purchased. The buyer can deny all if detected 
because they were unaware. 
Another type of attack is to steal a controlled resource, while leaving the TAG 
behind either by itself or as a second tag on another item. 
RFID Money 
There are a wide variety of items that have an equivalency of currency in the world 
today: 
9 
Two-way radio resort RFID wristbands (passive) are being issued to all 
guests that have either an established cash amount or the equivalent of the 
magnetic strip of one of your personal credit cards stored on them. These 
bands serve as your passport during your stay, and are intended to make you 
and your children's stay more seamless. 
9 
Many banks and credit card providers have started sending updated credit 
cards (passive), each containing an P,.FID chip so that the customer can just 
wave the card in close proximity at the point of purchase, where you for- 
merly needed to produce two-factor authentication, a card and a signature. 
Challenging a purchase may become harder unless more point of purchase 
video is also implemented. 167 
9 
Poker chips (passive) are in use today to distinguish legitimate from coun- 
terfeit chips. With all the controls in a casino, tracking who has how much 
will be easier. The appropriate controls will be at the discretion of the chip 
provider. 
9 
Taking money between countries using resort bands or casino chips is a 
concern.

Potentially Bad Uses 
1KFID as a technology is neither good nor bad. It is how the technology is used or 
misused that will determine whether the general public feels that it is good or bad. 
Experience has shown that the intentions for adopting widespread use of the tech- 
nology are perfectly honorable and therefore should proceed. On the other hand, as 
with audio and video capture and duplication devices, there are vast areas for inap- 
propriate uses, which even vary from country to country. The following is a listing of 
some potentially undesirable uses for the technology: 
9 
Traversing a subway car or football game capturing passive data from credit 
or debit cards and such. A problem in early generations of the technology, 
but will hopefully someday no longer be a concern any more than inter- 
ception of home walk-around phones. 
9 
Retransmitting (active and passive) data using a more powerful transmitter. 
If the receiving application or service does not have the appropriate con- 
trols in place to evaluate overloads and inappropriate data patterns, this 
could cause massive disruption of service. How massive is a function of the 
criticality and interconnected systems. 
9 
Reading all sorts of assets while in transit, and replaying the data elsewhere. 
Can data appear in two places at once? Can the data just pop in and out as 
it is used for fraudulent purposes? 
9 
Electronic warfare applications. Let's leave that realm of possibilities to those 
specializing in that area. 
9 
Detonators, remotely powered, can wait for their targets indefinitely. 
9 
Wreaking havoc with DOD and NATO supply chain management. 
Possible disruption of accuracies within the supply chain have been known 
to alter the course of history. 
9 
Remote disabling of a vehicle. (Out of one episode of Star Trek.) Of course 
this would all be done with Big Brother being the only one in possession of 
the digital certificate allowing this to happen. 
9 
Terrorist activities. 
An opposing view includes some items that may or may not be good based on your 
own values, such as: 
9 
Significantly reduced underground economy.

9 
Tracked money; you will no longer be able to hide cash from Big Brother. 
9 
Cash flow audit trails may be easier to follow once government cash flow 
databases are implemented.

Cash payments to your home and lawn help will now be available for 
review. 
9 Every financial transaction verified through the OCC clearinghouse. 
RFID Virus 
It has been reported that an RFID buffer overflow bug could infect RFID databases 
at airports for baggage, and possibly passport databases to compromise confidential 
information. 
Attacks have been predicted to come in the form of a SQL injection or a 
buffer overflow attack. 
For demonstration purposes, researchers have created a proof-of-concept, 
self-replicating RFID virus.

Summary 
In summary, the use of R.FID technology has definite pros and cons. The debate on 
the use of the technology will likely go on for many years to come and new unin- 
tended results of the technology will likely appear in the media on a regular basis. 
With that in mind, do the benefits overshadow the risks? It will depend on which 
group you are speaking with. The use of this ~i}hnology will likely become more of 
a moral or privacy issue as it rolls out further. 1 predict one thing though, and that is 
the technology and infrastructure will be pretty much in place before the general 
public knows what is happening. Then comes the use or misuse of the technology, 
depending on your perspective. Luckily each country has legal systems to resolve any 
issues and take corrective action. Simply put, if you think you may be doing some- 
thing wrong, don't do it, because Big Brother may be watching...

Chapter 6 9 Open Source Intelligence 
Introduction 
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has a nice ring to its name. What is Open 
Source Intelligence? Simply put, it's the gathering of information from publicly 
available sources in order to develop a greater level of awareness or understanding. 
The Department of Defense more precisely defines OSINT as "intelligence that is 
produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and dissem- 
inated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a 
specific intelligence requirement."~ A good Open Source Intelligence program can 
provide a great deal of knowledge, create leverage in negotiations, enable smarter 
decisions regarding the selection of goods and services, help avoid pitfalls and haz- 
ards, and generate many other advantages useful in giving one group an edge over 
another. While there are many uses for Open Source Intelligence programs, the 
focus of this chapter is on the use of Open Source Intelligence to identify and help 
mitigate risks to security~particularly information security. 
Open Source Intelligence is far from a new concept. Many states, businesses, aca- 
demics, and individuals have always found uses for public information. Clearly, 
national intelligence services the world over have uncovered useful information by 
reading newspapers, listening to the airwaves of their adversaries, or looking up vital 
facts about their counterparts in encyclopedias and atlases. Businesses have learned 
from rival companies by following patents, reading product information, or 
reviewing public financial filings. What's different in the twenty-first century, and 
what makes Open Source Intelligence a great part of the whole package of intelli- 
gence gathering? The answer is the pervasiveness of the Internet and its use as a tool. 
This has been helped along by the explosion of information available today, much of 
it from sources where access was once denied. These key dynamics make Open 
Source Intelligence a truly relevant information gathering technique for both nation 
states and everyday citizens. 
Given all this, in order to develop useful information products, it's important to 
bear in mind that the basic tenets of the intelligence process can be explained with 
five Ds. 
Direction 
It's hard to begin anything without having an idea of why you are doing it. 
Direction provides that guidance to move forward in order to deliver or meet a cer- 
tain goal or objective. To be successful, an OSINT program must deliver expected 
information at appropriate times so as to support decision makers. But in order to 
deliver the right information to your client, you must know what their expectations 

Open Source Intelligence 9 Chapter 6 
167 
are. Time must be set aside to work with those decision makers that receive the 
OSINT products. Gaining an understanding of key elements of the decision maker's 
process will help formulate the direction or mission for the OSINT function. From 
the decision maker, a clearly defined "Mission Statement" or goal for the decision 
maker can be used to set the stage for information collection and analysis. 
Once the objective of the group has been identified, the goal of its information 
collection and analysis can be derived. What steps must be taken to complete the 
goal? As a simple example, let's establish that our aim is to go to a baseball game 
today. The subcomponents that must be accomplished to make this goal a reality are 
to (1) purchase a ticket, and (2) drive to the stadium. Thus, we've identified two 
simple subcomponents that must be achieved. 
Next, review the subcomponents individually. Determine what might affect each 
subcomponent, or what information needs to be known to support the subcompo- 
nent. Going back to our example: 
Subcomponent" Purchase a Ticket 
9 
What are ticket prices? 
9 
When are the games? 
9 
Where are the games? 
9 
Who is playing? 
Rethink the subcomponents. Analyzing a subcomponent may reveal other views 
or contingencies that were not originally part of the stated goal, but that may help 
reach it. Try paraphrasing or broadening the scope of the subcomponent. 
Subcomponent" Drive to the Stadium 
9 
Can we walk to the stadium? 
[] 
Can we catch a bus to the stadium? 
9 
Can we take a boat to the stadium? 
9 
Should we take a taxi to the stadium? 
9 
Can we watch the game on TV at home? 
Provide counter views and identify both positive and negative potential impacts 
for each subcomponent. In looking at the subcomponents, review them for best- 
and worst-case scenarios, along with other things that might affect the success or 

168 
Chapter 6 9 Open Source Intelligence 
failure of the subcomponent. For more complex subcomponents, it may be necessary 
to contact experts in those fields to flesh out a full set of focus areas. Continuing 
with our baseball game example: 
Subcomponents" Purchase 
Ticket and Drive to the Stadium 
9 
Would a traffic accident make it difficult to drive to the stadium? 
9 
Can other major events cause congestion on the roads to the stadium? 
9 
Are major celebrities or political figures going to attend the games? 
9 
Could I be defrauded when I purchase the tickets? 
9 
What will happen if there is heavy rain or a thunderstorm? 
Once the analysis of the goal is complete, it is possible to develop key concepts 
or areas of focus. With the concepts and an understanding from the decision maker 
about time tables, it is possible to begin collecting information, and then process that 
information to develop the Open Source Intelligence products. From the example 
we started, we can derive the following concepts that would be of interest to the 
decision makers. 
Concepts 
9 
Pricing baseball tickets to include deals and plans that affect the price 
9 
The scheduling of baseball games at local stadiums 
9 
Directions and routes to the stadium 
9 
Major local events scheduled during baseball games 
9 
Frauds related to baseball tickets sales 
Now that we have key concepts that will support the decision makers and pro- 
vide them with information that is relevant, it is necessary to determine the appro- 
priate intervals to provide reports and information to the decision makers. Too 
frequent reports will generate noise and take away focus. It will also produce a heavy 
burden on the collection and analysis efforts of the OSINT team. Too few reports 
and information that was once relevant may have expired or been rendered useless 
by the time it is given to the decision makers. Urgent updates may need immediate 
dissemination, while routine updates may come on a daily, weekly, or monthly 
schedule, as well as another that is relevant. 

Open Source Intelligence 9 Chapter 6 
169 
Also keep in mind that there are times when information is provided to a 
member of the organization that cannot be shared. This information could be pro- 
vided as a classified briefing or come from a source that prefers anonymity. While 
the information provided may be too sensitive to share directly, it's possible the 
information (or something sufficiently close) exists in open-source information. Or, 
if too sensitive, the concept may be given, but not sources and details. Such directed 
collection efforts often results in a single special OSINT product that can be used to 
share relevant information. 
Discovery 
The second D is for Discovery: "Knowing who knows."This is the first step in the 
process, and is of vital importance. Knowing what sources of information exist to 
support the effort is critical. No program should confine itself to using only online 
sources, limiting the sources in this manner makes the program little more than a 
treasure hunt. Thankfully, some partnerships and forums exist that have common 
interests. The following are some groupings by area that may be of interest if you are 
in the discovery process yourself. 
Sources of Information 
In this section, we list various sources of information pertaining to Open Source 
Intelligence.

tion sharing group listed. Don't depend solely on those links to keep 
yourself informed, however. Much of the true information sharing 
takes place in face-to-face meetings, over a meal or drinks. To get the 
most out of a group, you will need to join them and support some of 
the initiatives that don't directly affect you. As you get to know them 
and they get to know you, they will come to confide in you and share 
some of the real details of what they encounter. 
Search Engines 
Search engines are extremely useful tools that can provide users with access to infor- 
mation. Knowing how to effectively use a search utility is important in increasing the 
likelihood that the results provided will be relevant to your collection effort. A number 
of good search engines are available. Most are free, but all have their own nuances. 
Understanding the proper syntax for searching and having a basic understanding of 
how the tools work will help ensure they provide the needed information. 
Individual Search Engines 
Individual search engines are systems that compile their own searchable database of 
the Web. These systems catalogue or index the site by using Web crawlers, spiders, or 
robots that roam the Web looking for new information to index. When a user 
searches with an engine, the search criteria or terms are checked against the index, 
and based on the terms' frequency in the document and their location in relation to 
each other, a relevancy number is provided. The actual working processes that estab- 
lish what is indexed, how a search is executed, and how the relevancy rating is 
assigned differ greatly from search engine to search engine.

9 Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) 
9 Alta Vista (www.altavista.com) 
9 Lycos (www.lycos.com) 
Meta Search Engines 
Meta Search Engines do not have their own individual database to search. Nor do 
they search the Internet to find a page of relevancy. Instead, they capitalize on 
querying other search databases. The results they provide cover the use of a number 
of individual search utilities. The results are then blended together, which should 
yield a cross-spectrum search and should theoretically produce a list of results with 
greater relevancy. 
Examples of meta search engines include:

Mamma (www.mamma.com) 
Deep Web Search Utilities 
The deep Web is primarily information that is stored information on databases. The 
reason it is called the "deep Web" or "Invisible Web" is because it consists of data on 
the Internet that cannot be indexed by individual search utilities. The deep Web is 
estimated to be 500 times the size of the known Web. Most of this information is 
housed on databases. These are databases that cannot be scanned or accessed by the 
individual search utilities. Nevertheless, tools exist that allow users to search these 
databases and receive relevancy information as well as notices of updates. 
Examples of deep Web search utilities include:

Fee-Based Services 
Fee-based sources allow for the recovery of very useful information and research, but 
of course there is the caveat that it costs money. With other Internet-based utilities, 
there is the ability to remain somewhat anonymous. A greater discussion of why you 
may wish to keep some anonymity when conducting your collection efforts is 
detailed in the section titled "Collection Trade Craft." In using a fee-based service, 
the ability to remain anonymous disappears, so when using the service, realize that 
your actions may be logged. The logging should not be a problem, but know that 
the potential exists for someone to review your actions. 
.......... 
i~ 
Using fee services can be very helpful. The information they provide 
can be crucial, and much of the information they possess is not, nor 
can it be, provided by free solutions. Generally, no concerns exist 
about the logging or the potential for log analysis, but when forming 
collection plans and executing ther 29 little paranoia can do you 
good. 
Another consideration when using fee-based services is that some skill or essen- 
tial knowledge may be required to use them effectively to obtain information rele- 
vant to a particular issue or collection tactic. Without the necessary level of 
understanding, the information collected may be completely irrelevant. The service 
may charge for the results obtained, so collecting useless info may become a very 
costly endeavor. The following are examples of fee-based services that may be sup-

Chapter 6 9 Open Source Intelligence 
While many potential sources of information have been identified in this sec- 
tion, this is far from a comprehensive list. The information provided is intended to 
offer a starting point, and although the Web site of the sources are identified, true 
understanding and capabilities assessment requires personal contact with the groups. 
Personal knowledge and assessment will help identify those products, services, or 
contacts produced by these groups that are relevant, reliable, and useful. This candid 
understanding of sources makes up the third D of Open Source Intelligence, the 
"D" of Discrimination. 
Discrimination 
In OSINT, "discrimination" is the art of"Knowing What's What." Numerous 
sources of information exist to tap into. Many contacts are freely available, while 
many are fee-based vendors. Having a wide base of information is a necessary com- 
ponent of the program, but just as elsewhere in life, you can have too much of a 
good thing. For instance, having too much information that does not correlate easily 
can end up burning more of your time and resources than can be justified. Too 
much uns 
info coming in can be described as noise. Resources tied up trying 
to identify golden nuggets of info fromnoise ends up delaying analysis and thus 
crippling the development of useable intelligence estimates. 
Bias is another consideration witl 29 the discrimination phase. Knowing why a 
source is willing to provide you with information is critical in assessing the value of 
the information provided. Everyone has a bias, it is sometimes obvious, but more 
often than not predispositions are subtle and not readily evident. A way to identify 
some of a source's bias is to review the source's history, objectively read works pro- 
duced by the source, and review critiques, evaluations or directly ask for feedback 
from others who have previously engaged the source. Of course, with the latter anal- 
ysis, keep in mind that those providing feedback also have their own bias. These are 
parts of effective source evaluation. Remember that you have your own bias as well, 
which may affect your interpretation of the source material and perhaps slant your 
analysis. Looking at source evaluation a bit more holistically, it would be fair to make 
the evaluation in two phases. Phase 1 is the Preliminary Assessment, while the 
second phase is the Content Assessment. 
Preliminary Assessment 
In the preliminary assessment, the evaluation that you make is based on secondary 
information. More precisely, it's information not directly derived from the source 
content. Assess the individual~know the writer or interviewee's credentials. It is 
helpful to know the source's background. If they have a long and credible history 
working directly in the field they are providing information for, there is a good 

Open Source Intelligence 9 Chapter 6 
179 
chance they are knowledgeable in the subject. Look for the source's biography if it's 
available. 
As an additional consideration for the preliminary assessment, determine if the 
source has ever been cited in other material. If the source is respected in the subject 
area, they are often cited in other works. Look for the association or institution to 
which the source is a member. If there is a group the source is affiliated with, 
gaining an understanding of that group by identifying the group's goals and values 
would be helpful in assessing the knowledge, and even the bias, of the source. 
Timeliness is also a factor in making a preliminary assessment. In most cases, the 
more current the date, the better the chance the information includes the latest data 
on a topic. Publishing dates are normally found on or near the title page of a work. 
On Web pages, especially news services, the date of publication may be listed down 
to the exact time of day the information was posted to the Internet. 
Who is the publisher? Knowing a bit about the publisher can provide some 
insight regarding their consideration for the source. A well-known publisher may 
engage in a great deal of discrimination considering it must invest lots of time and 
resources into the works it supports. A university press may be more scholarly and 
less likely to create a popular work. This insight may provide a view into the respect 
afforded a writer, but it does not guarantee the work's quality. 
Content Assessment 
After you complete the initial assessment, the true work begins on analyzing the 
source. Content assessment deals with getting into the substance of the source. It 
begins by reading the preface of the work to gain an understanding of the source's 
intent. Review tables of contents to identify areas of interest within the work. 
When reading the work, keep in mind that identifying the intended audience 
for the author will help in understanding the usefulness of the information. Is the 
author trying to educate the public, or is the author focused on providing material 
to experts in a particular focus area? The information may be too general or too 
detailed depending on the intended audience of the author. 
Is the author's bias reasonable? Is the information the author is presenting the 
facts, their opinion, or is the material propaganda? If the information is factual, it can 
be corroborated through another source. Validating information across several sources 
assists in validating several works in parallel. Without validation, a writer can gen- 
erate opinions that resemble fact but are not. In reading the material, it is vital to 
look for new ideas or concepts not consistent with other material previously 
reviewed that is related to the subject.

180 
Chapter 6 9 Open Source Intelligence 
Understanding the scope of the work in relation to other material already ana- 
lyzed helps to further provide greater knowledge of an area, or validate other facts 
currently known. More views of a subject ensure that the resulting analysis takes into 
consideration other thoughts on a particular issue. If the material is a primary source, 
the factual information is directly collected through this work and is considered 
original. A secondary source uses primary sources to deliver these thoughts. 
It should also be possible to categorize the sources into several groups; Advocacy, 
Business/Marketing, News, Informational, and Personal.You may find additional cat- 
egories useful, but these should offer a good start. Each category has traits particular 
to it and all provide valuable information if analyzed appropriately. 
Advocacy Assessment 
Advocacy sources have a goal of influencing public opinion or drawing attention to 
a particular cause. They frequently use ".org as the extension of their Uniform 
Resource Link (UP, L) address. Influencing is a direct goal of their existence; thus, 
the information provided is generally very supportive of their cause. The following is 
a checklist2that can be useful in assessing an advocacy source. 
Criterion # 1 "Authority 
1. 
Is it clear what organization 2~gcesponsible for the content? 
2. 
Is there information describing the goals of the organization? 
3. 
Is there a way to verify the legitimacy of this organization? In other words, 
is there a phone number or postal address for more information? (A simple 
e-mail address is not enough.) 
4. 
Is there a statement that the content has been officially approved by the 
organization? 
5. 
Is the content from the national head of the organization, or a local 
chapter? 
6. 
Is there a statement that indicates the named organization is the copyright 
holder? 
Criterion #2"Accuracy 
o 
Are the sources for any factual information clearly listed so they can be 
verified in another source? (If not, the page may still be useful as an 
example of the organization's ideas, but not as a source of factual 
information.) 

Open Source Intelligence 9 Chapter 6 
181 
. 
Is the information free of grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors? 
(These kinds of errors indicate a lack of quality control, thoroughness, 
and professionalism. They also can actually produce inaccuracies in the 
information.) 
Criterion #3"Objectivity 
1. Are the organization's biases clearly stated? 
2. 
If there is any advertising on the page, is it clearly differentiated from the 
informational center? 
Criterion #4" Currency

Criterion ]45" Coverage 
1. 
Is there any indication that the document or content is complete, and that 
it's not a draft or currently under construction? 
2.

3. 
Does the page succeed in addressing the topics, or has something significant 
been omitted? 
4. 
Is the organization's point of view presented clearly, with its arguments well 
supported? 
The greater the number of questions answered "yes," the more likely the source 
is of high information quality as an advocacy page. 
Business/Marketing Assessment 
Business and Marketing materials are just that. Designed to promote or sell a com- 
pany's goods or services. These pages can be very useful in learning details about a 
product of interest, or learning particular details of an incident being handled by a 
company. The following is an evaluation checklist for business/marketing sources.

Internet news is a primary way to gain up-to-date information. This channel of 
information sharing also provides access to news outlets from other countries, as well 
as news assembled at local levels. Examples of news sources are www.cnn.com and 
www.news.bbc.co.uk. The following is an evaluation checklist for news sources. 4

Informational Assessment 
Informational sources are established for the purpose of providing factual informa- 
tion. These sources are usually provided by educational institutions or governmental 
agencies. They offer access to information such as calendars, services, statistics, and 
dictionaries. The following is an evaluation checklist for informational sources. ~

4. 
Is it clear who wrote the material, and are the author's qualifications for 
writing on this topic clearly stated? 
Criterion #2"Accuracy 
. 
Are the sources for any factual information clearly listed so they can be 
verified in another source? 
2. 
Is the information free of grammatic 29 pelling, and typographical errors? 
3. 
Is it clear as to who is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the mate- 
rial's content?

3. 
If material is presented in graphs and/or charts, is it clearly stated when the 
data was gathered? 
4. 
If the information is published in different editions, is it clearly labeled 
which edition the material is from? 
Criterion #5: Coverage 
1. 
Is there any indication that the page has been completed and is not cur- 
rently under construction? 
2. 
Is there a clear indication of whether the entire work is available on the 
Web, or only parts of it? 
Personal Assessment 
Materials from personal sources are often the most difficult to evaluate because the 
information needed to validate them 29 y be difficult to find. Information from per- 
sonal sources are published or made available by individuals that may not have an 
affiliation with any organization or group. The following is an evaluation checklist 6 
for personal Web pages. 
Criterion # 1 "Authority 
1. 
Is it clear which individual is responsible for the contents of the page? 
2. 
Does the individual responsible for the page indicate his or her qualifica- 
tions for writing on this topic?

Is there a way of verifying the legitimacy of this individual? 
Criterion #2"Accuracy 
, 
Are the sources for any factual information clearly listed so they can be 
verified in other sources? (If not, the page may still be useful as an example 
of the ideas of the individual, but not as a source of factual information.)

187 
. 
Is the information flee of grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors? 
(These kinds of errors not only indicate a lack of quality control, thorough- 
ness, and professionalism, but can actually produce inaccuracies in the infor- 
mation.) 
Criterion #3" Objectivity 
1. Are the person's biases clearly stated? 
Criterion #4" Currency 
1. Are there dates in the material to indicate:

Are there any indications that the material has been kept current? 
Criterion ]45" Coverage 
29 
1. Is there any indication that the page is complete, and not currently under 
construction? 
2. If there is a print equivalent of the Web page, is there a clear indication of 
whether the entire work is available on the Web, or only parts of it? 
This preliminary assessment affords some discrimination to hopefully reduce and 
even eliminate investing effort in analyzing works that are not worthwhile. 
After you develop your key concepts and assessing the sources to draw from, it's 
possible to build the collection plans to support the OSINT process. Collection 
plans establish the process workings for the OSINT team. The collection plan needs 
to include the name of the source, who is responsible, the concepts being researched, 
any key search terms or focuses, any necessary information required to access the 
source, and the appropriate time interval associated with the collection. A simple 
chart can help manage the collection effort for the team. So, continuing with our 
baseball game intelligence requirements, an example chart may look like that shown 
in Table 6.1.

Collection Trade Craft 
Knowing what you will collect is critical in ensuring you get the information you 
require to support the decision maker's goals and meet the task requirements 
assigned to you.You must also consider that there are adversaries and competitors 
formulating strategies and tactics similar in nature to yours, and as a part of that they 
may have an Open Source Intelligence program of their own. Even if they don't, 
plenty of others like to observe, and they are often more than happy to share their 
findings to further a cause that interests them, to provide the same to your competi- 
tors for a fee, to happily sell their findings back to you so you can prevent disclosure, 
or they may simply disclose information just for the sake of doing so. Thus, 
Operational Security (OPSEC) comes into play when considering the actions you 
intend to take. 
~TE 
i~i 
OPSEC becomes important in your collection effort in that an adver- 
sary may be able to identify your direction and intentions by under- 
standing what you are looking for. If you overhear me ask someone" 
"Do you know when the next baseball game is?", "How much are the 
tickets?", and "How long does it take to drive to the baseball sta- 
dium?" You learn something about me and my direction. You could 
think of strategies that would make my quest to see a baseball game 
more difficult if you were so inclined, and had the resources available 
to be successful. 
In addition to OPSEC concerns, methods of collection may be potentially haz- 
ardous to the health of your computer systems or supporting networks. Going to 
sites that are unknown to you may lead you to Web sites containing code that takes 
advantage of vulnerabilities existing in your system. Collections systems should be 
used for just collecting information. There should be no other information con- 
tained on the device should the system become compromised and exploited by an 
adversary. 
Employ discretion, not deception. In being discrete, you choose not to provide 
information, thus concealing data that may be used to piece together your identity 
and direction. In being deceptive, you choose to give information, but the informa- 
tion you provide is false or misdirecting. This may be dismissible in many instances, 
but it only takes one bad incident to make a very painful or embarrassing mark. It is 

190 
Chapter 6 9 Open Source Intelligence 
very hard to get a full understanding of a person without spending a good deal of 
time observing their behavior and working closely alongside them. Most of the rela- 
tionships forged using Internet-based systems results in the issue of engaging and 
collecting information from people who are unknown. Providing misleading infor- 
mation to the wrong person can lead to digging that will unravel the lie and create 
an unfortunate situation. 
ARNING 
'7 
@ 
Consider that your operations may be disclosed. If they are, given the 
two directions available to you, what choice would you make? "We 
chose not to disclose information because we did not feel such disclo- 
sure was necessary," or "We chose to lie because.., er... ah..." As you 
can see, the latter choice has the potential of becoming very embar- 
rassing. 
In establishing your connectivity to the Internet, try to keep it as anonymous as 
possible. Do not use a company or agency proxy for your connection. Internet 
Proxy (IP) addresses for an individual 
uire court subpoenas in order for a 
requestor to identify the customer us12~ the IP address. While for many, mid-sized 
or larger companies are issued IP address blocks. A "whois" look up of the IP address 
may yield the company of origination. If you cannot obtain a personal account to 
access the Internet, use a "legitimate" anonymous proxy. Fee-based services for 
anonymous surfing are available. The following vendors provide such service:

Refrain from entering identifying information to initialize your hardware or 
software. Registered user names exist within the system almost permanently, in one 
form or another, as resident information on the device. Leave the information blank, 
or enter a couple characters to have the field accept the entered information. 
Keep the browsing system clean, do not develop intelligence reports, handle per-

good. The second worry is that your system may pick up code 
"cooties" or viruses along the way; thus, wiping and restoring brings 
back a certain level of confidence in your system. 
Work safely. Maintain a fairly high security posture, keep up with your system 
updates, implement firewalls correctly, maintain up-to-date antivirus and spyware 
applications. Reduce exposures by working in text, limiting many Web content sup- 
porting applications, and removing applications that are outdated or unused. 
Distillation 
The fourth D is for Distillation~"Knowing What's Hot" is probably the hardest 
part of the process. The challenge of analyzing open-source information is that the 
readers can potentially miss the biases inherent in such sources. The nature of the 
material also exposes readers to the risk of outright deception. Therefore, before the 
analysis can occur, considerable time must be spent detailing the validity of the 
source and having a firm understanding of the biases that exist with the source. Even 
if the source is deceptive, knowing this up-front, the reader should still be able to 
gain valuable knowledge despite the faqade. 
Providing the right kind of support to meet the expectations of the client (the 
decision maker) is very important. In analyzing the data, does the client expect to 
receive information without too much analysis? Does the client expect the informa- 
tion to forecast possible future actions or events? Or does the client expect a level of 
effort that provides options to remedy possible events, and then forecasts the effects 
of the decisions made by the client? Expectations cause varying degrees of stress to 
the process and require different skill levels to meet the demands effectively. Clearly 
understanding the expected level of effort will help ensure the client's expectations 
are met when the final product is delivered.

Basic Analysis Support 
Basic analysis support is only slightly more work than the information collection 
effort. In collecting the information, the collection effort is centered on searching 
assessed sources for concepts that support or detract from the team goal. In providing 
this level of support, the analysis is fairly simple. To be successful, the concepts that 
affect the outcome of the team goals must be well laid out and addressed with the 
collection effort. The analyst must understand the concepts, and then use that 
knowledge when reviewing the collection material to ensure that the information 
not only meets the needs of the decision maker but fulfills the requirements outlined 
by the decision maker's parties as well as others who have been impacted. 
So the analysis is a review of the information and confirms that the information 
directly ties into the concepts previously identified in the direction phase. While this 
may seem like an easy task, even if the team only matures to provide basic analysis 
support, getting the resources to drive even this level of support is a daunting task. 
The goal should be to deliver the information as quickly and concisely as possible. 
Consider including a validations step. Confirm the findings you intend to pre- 
sent from another source. It will add time, but this step may save countless explana- 
tions should you report on something inaccurate, absolutely wrong, or that is a 
complete fabrication. It may not be necessary to validate the info before dissemina- 
tion if the proper expectation has been set. 
'i

ARNING 
.... a~{ 
:~ .~!~ 
Carefully consider who you will be providing the information to. If 
they cannot handle stress well, and can't quite see the big picture, you 
may be about to set their hair on fire and prompt them to ignite addi- 
tional issues. It is far better to simply validate and inform people who 
have a low threshold for stressful problems. 
Intermediate Analysis Support 
In an intermediate analysis support function, the goal is to offer predictive informa- 
tion as well as provide the decision maker with relevant information that supports 
the team's goal. Considerations must be made about the skill sets of the analysts 
achieving this level of support. Having people with an understanding of how to 
think analytically would be a major benefit to support this activity.

When reviewing the collection material, remain objective. Do not make assump- 
tions. Simply look at what the data provides. As a first step, review the concepts 
identified for the team to meet its needed goals. When analyzing the collected infor- 
mation, you can focus on it in three ways to yield information that is supportive of 
your effort. Look for emergence, trends, and aberrations of trends. 
When considering emergence, know what the assumptions are and list them if 
possible. When reviewing collected information, look for messages or information that 
contradicts the expected norm. Take that emerging issue, revisit your concepts, and ask 
what effect the change would make, and what else is impacted. Conduct research in 
these areas to help form a better picture of the future for the decision maker. 
Identifying trends allows you to forecast normal events. When reviewing the col- 
lected information, look for any messages or themes that repeat themselves over 
time. Understanding the consistent themes will provide a baseline from which to 
o ~erate. Knowing what is expected not only provides predictive information, it also 
hel~s identify aberrations.

Dissemination 
The final D is for Dissemination, "Knowing Who's Who." When the information is 
collected to help provide direction, one of the most important issues is to tackle just 
who the decision makers are and what information they need to be successful. These 
are the individuals that the intelligence products are being created for and delivered 
to. Also, understand how they would like the material presented to them. In addi- 
tion, the information should contain a subject line, source of information, the con- 
cept impacted, the information itself, and a validation source. Table 6.2 shows an

Summary 
To be useful in a business setting, intelligence gathering must have a purpose. The 
collection of information for the sake of knowing as much as you possibly can is 
hard to justify to a company carefully monitoring its expenditures. Depending on 
the type and size of the business, there may be many business partners struggling 
with how exactly they may scope the risk. A physical security detachment may be 
concerned about the safety, health, and welfare of the company's employees. A fraud 
loss protection group may be attempting to shield the company from sustaining 
financial losses due to fraud, or may be seeking to gain assistance from law enforce- 
ment in an attempt to recover lost funds. Information security teams worry about 
threats both external and internal to a company that may cause a loss of availability, 
reliability, or confidentiality of their information resources. Each partner may have at 
its disposal many sourees of information particular to its needs. A truly effective plan 
would cut across the silos of information to develop a more detailed understanding 
of threats, and how those threats would manifest themselves to the risk partners and 
company. Each partner will have reservations about sharing, and resistance will natu- 
rally be demonstrated. Think about it: the type of people that usually work in these 
areas are skeptical by nature, so presenting them with the concept of sharing info 
would be fairly hard met. 
In order to be effective in developing a program for a company, the facilitator 
leading the charge must have buy-in from executive management, spend time under- 
standing the needs of all the potential customers and stakeholders of the intelligence 
products, clearly identify the requirements needed to be successful for the customer, 
do an inventory of the information sources already available within the organization 
and learn what sources are needed to complete the program. Develop clear collec- 
tion plans and sensible analysis techniques. Deliver clear reporting that is timely and 
meets the expectations of the clients. 
Completing all those tasks should create a perfect opportunity for an OSINT 
team to exist and excel in a business environment.

Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
Introduction 
For the past few years I have been passionate about increasing the sophistication of 
wireless users through ethical war driving and the development of grass roots educa- 
tional programs. It all started back in the fall of 2004 when I and a group of col- 
leagues sat around a table to discuss ideas we could implement in our area with 
limited funding but that would have maximum impact on the community. 
Collectively, we came up with the idea of conducting a war driving research project 
to assess the growth of wireless networks over a 12-month period in a major 
metropolitan area~specifically the Phoenix, Arizona area. 
Phoenix is a large metropolitan city with a representative population that is ideal 
for collecting demographic data. Covering over 9200 square miles, the Phoenix 
Valley metroplex is the sixth largest city in the U.S., and as the population of the 
valley grows, so does the widespread use of the Internet, with the addition of many 
wireless access points within network infrastructures. These networks are incorpo- 
rated within businesses, schools, government offices, and private homes. The conve- 
nience of wireless networks has driven their phenomenal growth within the last few 
years. This has exposed a large amount of corporate and personal data to outside 
individuals, leading to the possible theft of this information, which can include trade 
secrets, financial data, and individual identities. Our 12-month study was designed to 
evaluate the growth of wireless network presence and the various wireless security 
protocols used. The results of the study were intended to be compared to census data 
to support or disprove assumptions made regarding the proliferation of wireless and 
the use of wireless security standards. 
With the idea in place, my role in the project was to supply the resources to 
implement the project both from a human and technological standpoint. My first 
order of business was to get the technology in place. I knew I had a very limited 
budget and that most of that would have to be allocated to gas for the drivers. I 
would have loved to have had unlimited funds or even grant money to purchase all 
kinds of equipment. As I sat and thought about it, I really wanted to purchase a fleet 
of Scion XBs and turn them into the ultimate war-driving vehicles, complete with 
omnidirectional antennas and built-in Linux boxes that booted up when the car was 
turned on so that data was collected every time they ran, and then they uploaded 
the information to a secure database as soon as they parked on campus. In reality, 
however, all I had to work with was eight IBM A22m laptops that were fully depre- 
ciated and due for sale at the next liquidation date. But at least I had eight working 
laptops with PCIMCA slots. 
I knew I needed working computers, a reliable operating system that allowed for 
the most stable build of Kismet, GPS devices, power for the machines in the vehi- 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
199 
cles, drivers, a database programmer, and a project champion. I was fortunate enough 
to have access to faculty and students at the university so after casually interviewing 
a few interested faculty members, I recruited A1 Kelly to assist me in leading the 
group of students. Overall, I had a budget of $5,000 to complete the entire project, 
and I knew I was going to be hard pressed to complete the project for that amount 
of money. 
My next task was to design a War Driving Kit. The kit needed to be a plug-and- 
play unit that any student group or volunteer could use with little expertise or set- 
up time. I worked with Professor Kelly on this as well as one of my IT comrades 
who is excellent at finding and negotiating hardware deals. As mentioned before, we 
knew what computers we were using and were fortunate enough to have eight 
machines with the exact same configurations that were all in working order. We 
decided on using the Garmin eTrek handheld GPS with serial adapter, a 5db mag- 
netic mount antenna, Orinoco Gold cards with the antenna input, a car power 
adapter specifically made for the IBM computers, a map of Phoenix and a laptop 
bag to hold all the goodies. When all was said and done, we spent a total of $2,190 
on the war driving kits. 
Once the initial kits were put together, it was time to assemble the team. We put 
some fliers up around the University campus attracting students that would be inter- 
ested in receiving college credit for participation in the program. To no one's sur- 
prise, we assembled a team in no time at all. There were six teams of two, consisting 
of a driver and a computer operator. The teams were given specific areas around the 
valley from which they would collect data. We let the teams go, and when the data 
began streaming in, we were surprised what we found. 
After the first round of data came in, I had a sneaking suspicion that the use of 
wireless networks was not so much a growing trend, but had already penetrated the 
market. Researching its growth was not going to be useful information. From the 
data we had collected, it was clear that wireless coverage was dense, even in the 
lower economic levels where we assumed there could be some disparity in the 
number of wireless access points. The reality was that in some places wireless net- 
work coverage was better than cell phone coverage. This was disappointing to some 
who thought this would become an economic study. But what the data showed was 
that while the use of wireless networks was clearly adopted in the residential areas of 
the city, security of those networks was not. This is where we began to get excited 
about making a difference. 
I hate to admit this as an educator, but generally I find research projects like the 
one we were working on quite useless to the average person. Who really cares about 
the growth of wireless networks in a metropolitan area? Maybe some entrepreneurs 
seeking to capitalize on a new market might be interested, but for the average 
www.syngress.com 

200 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
person the data is dull. I like working on projects that make a difference. I am a 
technologist and a futurist; I like being a part of changing the way people interact 
with technology more than observing how technology is being adopted. I have to 
say, when we saw the overwhelming numbers of access points that had no security 
on them whatsoever, I felt like we could actually take action and demonstrate how 
our data collection could lead to a more secure Internet, make users more aware of 
these technologies, and change the security posture of our society. That excited me. 
I began thinking about what it would take to actually change the security pos- 
ture of Phoenix. Then it hit me. What was it that made America start locking their 
cars and homes? When I grew up in the 1980s, hardly anyone where I lived locked 
their homes or cars.Yet now, everyone does it. It isn't as if we expect to have our 
vehicle stolen or house broken into every time we leave, but just to be safe, because 
it is a good practice, we all do it. I felt we needed to achieve the same with wireless 
networks. Here was the issue, though: I wanted to secure our wireless nation without 
instilling fear into every wireless user. It's fear that has made America a paranoid 
society~fear brought into our homes each night on the local news, on CNN, in the 
paper, all of which has been sensationalized in movies and television dramas. People 
were already afraid of hackers and it seemed like every time you turned around 
someone's identity was being stolen. 
The other major obstacle I found was that many people just didn't care about 
securing their wireless networks. The more people I spoke to that were inherently 
nontechnical immediately lost interest as soon as I mentioned the phrase 802.11, 
drop in a couple more terms like packets, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol), WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), or WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and 
it was like their brain began to shut down. It was almost as if they were afraid of 
even learning how the technology worked. This was the most frustrating discovery~ 
and it seemed that unless you did use fear tactics, there was no incentive for people 
to take the few minutes necessary to configure their network devices to communi- 
cate in a more secure fashion. In order to reach the people I wanted to help, I 
couldn't assume it was help they wanted. I needed to do that dreaded thing all net- 
work and systems administrators fear: I needed to think like a user and, thus, lead by 
example. 
Putting Together a War-Driving Team 
The term ethical war driver has come up recently, and I know we used it extensively 
when discussing the project. But what does it mean to be an ethical war driver? 
Technically, it means that as you are scanning wireless networks, you make sure your 
wireless card is set to not automatically accept every DHCP address in your area. It 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
201 
also means you are not going to use the data you collect to harm the networks you 
detect. Instilling this message into savvy technical users is harder than it sounds. The 
reality is that to lead by example means you must adhere to these rules yourself. It 
was then I realized how often I could open my laptop and "hop online" wherever I 
was. If there was information I needed, I undertook to get it instantly. Now, how- 
ever, I am responsible for not only securing all of the networks that make "hopping 
on" so easy, but taking a group of people out to gather data and dump it into a 
database that maps out the nearest wireless access point and all of its security infor- 
mation. I think ethical war driver means that as you learn more and more about 
wireless security there is an internal struggle as to how to use that information. As 
long as this internal struggle exists, you're all right. 
Putting a team of people together that collectively goes out and scans for wireless 
networks with the aligned goal of bettering the community is fun. Discovering the 
information in your area is fun. Driving around in your car, hearing the laptop beep 
every time a new network is discovered, reading the clever SSID (Service Set 
Identifier) that people use is exciting--it feels like you're hunting for treasure. With 
honest up-front communication in the beginning, partnered with reliable technology, 
you can assemble a team that can collect a lot of data in a short period of time. 
The following guidelines apply if you are putting a team of one or more people 
together for war driving, with idea of increasing the sophistication of wireless net- 
work users. First, all members must be committed to behaving ethically. It is imperative that 
when you embark on your journey of increasing the security posture of an area that 
the people in front of the community are above reproach. This means that no 
member of your team will connect to networks in which data is being collected. No 
information that is collected while war driving is published in any way that could 
potentially harm the users of these networks.Your role is to gather data to make a 
difference in a positive way, and your community should see you as a hero, not a 
criminal mastermind. Finally, in terms of ethical behavior, each member of your 
team should display that they have some level of internal struggle with the balance 
of knowledge, and the application of such. Just because you know how the tech- 
nology works and how to circumvent most security measures does not give anyone 
the right to use that knowledge for personal gain or exploit the naYve. 
The second trait you look for in assembling a war-driving team is technical profi- 
ciency. Each member of your team should be familiar with the tools they are using. 
You don't need a team of Linux gurus. In fact, it is best to have a well-rounded team 
of people with knowledge in OSX and Windows, as well as the suite of open-source 
tools available. In reality, it doesn't take much to assess the security posture in your 
immediate area. Almost all wireless devices will tell you what networks are visible~ 
the ones you can connect to without any form of authentication are essentially 
www.syngress.com 

202 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
unsecured. The more knowledge you can draw from within your team, the better 
your educational programs will be and the more impact you'll have on local net- 
works. Technical proficiency really comes into play during data collection. There is 
nothing worse than using an entire tank of gas collecting data only to find that none 
of the data was logged. Understanding what information is streaming in during the 
data collection process allows your team to better understand the security posture of 
the area. Hitting a neighborhood with a large number of access points displaying 
default settings is a clear indicator that you are in a place that needs education. 
The last skill set you are looking for when assembling a team is the ability to 
speak the user's language. This may even take longer than training people to uses the 
technical tools. I have found in most cases that those interested in assisting you are 
interested in the technology. Having your team learn to look at the technology 
from the point of view of the users can be difficult. Users in most cases just don't 
understand the technology, the vocabulary, how it works, or why it works.Your 
team must unlearn their lingo and speak in terms and metaphors users can relate 
to and understand. 
Whether you have a team of 1 or 20, it is important to remember your goal, 
which is to increase the sophistication of wireless network users. If everyone who 
understood the technology did his best to affect all of the networks he comes in 
contact with, eventually, every network would, at a minimum, have some level of 
encryption or some authentication method in place. Not everyone needs to have 
multiple layers of security, especially home users who use their laptops to check e- 
mail and surf the Web. Nevertheless, it can start in your home. When you connect to 
your home network, do you see your neighbor's wireless network? Is it open? Does 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
203 
your computer at times connect to a network other than your own? If so, then you 
can start with that network. Our team actually developed a way to continually col- 
lect data and extract information from the database that told us what areas had the 
greatest need for awareness programs. 
During the project, we had each member of our team submit the raw Kismet 
logs to the professor. From there, the teams' Database Administrator uploaded the 
information into a Microsoft SQL 2000 database. Once the information was in 
SQL, we were able to use Map Point 2000 to generate maps with color-coded dots 
to represent access points, and the security level of those access points. Security levels 
were assigned to each access point with a value of 0 to 3. Security Values were 
defined as follows: 
9 
0 = Default Settings 
9 
1 = Unsecured 
9 
2 =WEPorWPA 
9 
3 = WEP or WPA + no broadcast of SSID 
By assigning these values to each access point, we were able to then leverage the 
tools within Map Point 2000 to discover areas that needed training. We developed 
an algorithm that queries the information in the database to determine potential 
target access points. A target access point (TAP) is an access point in the database 
that has the following characteristics: 
m 
Seventy percent of the access points within a half mile radius have a secu- 
rity value of 0 or 1. 
I 
More than 50 percent of the adjacent access points must be of the same 
access point type. 
9 
The TAP must be in a residential area. 
Implementing this algorithm was slightly more complicated than designed on 
paper, but in the end we were able to get the information we needed from the 
database in order to see areas that needed training or awareness programs the most. 
Now that we knew where to go to evangelize users on the ease and importance of 
wireless security, we needed to make sure we all understood the technology in case 
we got some really good questions. The following information on wireless tech- 
nology was compiled in cooperation with students from the University of Advancing 
Technology involved in the Phoenix War Driving Project from the fall of 2004 
through April of 2006.

Increasing User Sophistication 
Making a difference in the security posture of a city or neighborhood takes more 
than just an idea. To truly make a difference, you need to have the knowledge of an 
expert and the patience and sensitivity of an elementary school teacher. It is essen- 
tial for those of us out there that want to make a difference to fully understand the 
technology and take that knowledge to the people in a language they can under- 
stand. In this section, we shall cover the technical terms and functionality of wire- 
less technology. 
Wireless networks use radio frequency (IKF) to transfer data from wireless access 
points. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and a common interna- 
tional agreement set aside the radio frequencies that can be used for unlicensed 
commercial use. The Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands include the 900- 
MHz, 2.4-MHz, and 5-GHz bands. When those frequencies become overcrowded, 
higher frequencies may be released. 
Wireless access points use 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz to transmit data. This frequency 
is called Spread Spectrum~meaning it traverses the frequency band to reliably 
transmit data. Spread Spectrum was originally designed by the military (just like 
most wireless technology). Spread spectrum distributes its signal over a wide range of 
frequencies uniformly, thus consuming more bandwidth in exchange for reliability, 
integrity, and security of communications. This wideband lets your wireless access 
point avoid interference and other signal noise. Wideband communications are 
nosier and easier to detect. 
You can think of it this way: the radio frequency used for wireless networks is 
able to find your wireless device and communicate with it using the best signal it 
can find based on its location. In your car, when you tune into a radio station and 
the channel gets fuzzy, your radio and the station do not change frequencies to pro- 
vide a better listening experience for you, but your laptop and access point do. 
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) 
and Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 
Two different versions of spread spectrum are available: Frequency-Hopping Spread 
Spectrum (FHSS) and Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS). DSSS has higher 
data rates, and a better range and error correction, while FHSS is easier to deploy 
because the equipment is less expensive. Wireless access systems use this Spread- 
Spectrum technology to transmit data, typically over the 2.4-GHz range. 
Unfortunately, Spread Spectrum is easy to detect if the attacker knows its signal since 
the receiver uses the same spreader code by the transmitter to be able to communi- 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
205 
cate.The FCC-released frequency of 2.4 GHz is divided into 75 1-MHz channels 
with a code sequence known to both the transmitter and receiver. DSSS on the 
other hand uses spread spectrum but breaks each bit in the signal into 11 sub-bits 
that are converted into waves over a wide range of frequencies. The receiver then 
spreads the chirp to decode the message. In 802.11, DSSS uses 64 8-bit code words 
to spread the signal, which to an eavesdropper just looks like random characters. 
From a security standpoint, an eavesdropper must know the hopping pattern of 
the Spread Spectrum in FHSS, and in DSSS the eavesdropper must know the code 
or code words, despite having to know the frequency band and modulation. Also 
they must know the scrambling pattern of the radio signal. DSSS and FHSS, and 
vice versa, are not interoperable, and can't communicate, and they would have to use 
entirely different techniques to intercept one another. The strengths of Spread- 
Spectrum technology are sufficient enough to defeat most eavesdroppers and con- 
tribute to the security of wireless networks. 
You can think of the information traveling on the FHSS as like the classic video 
game Frogger. The player moves from the bottom of the screen to the top, jumping 
into open spaces on a moving road, or on objects that can transport the data safely 
across the spectrum. The data is like the frog, making its way across the lanes of 
traffic and objects in the water, where each level represents a frequency. An observer 
watching the game can see how many spectrums can be traveled and the various 
ways to cross, but cannot reliably predict how the player will time the moves across 
the level. 
The 802.11 Alphabet 
One of the most talked about confusions in the world of wireless networking is that 
of the 802.11 alphabet. 802.11 operates in an unlicensed spectrum, where a license 
from the FCC is not required. Though there are some differences between the IEEE 
(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) who drafted the 802.11 protocol 
in 1997, these 802.11 signals a, b, and g (the most commonly used) employ DSSS, 
although 802.1 l a uses something called Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing as a modulation technique in the 5-GHz spectrum. 802.11b is cur- 
rently the most popular form of Wi-Fi. It uses frequencies in the 2.4-GHz range 
(2.400 to 2.485) and has 11 channels. Only three of these channels are nonoverlap- 
ping: channels 1, 6, and 1 i. This is only a guideline in reality, because if you begin to 
transmit too close to the range of the channels, you will get degradation of signal 
quality and throughput. I have seen this demonstrated in southern Arizona during 
the implementation of a Municipal Area Network. The top speed for 802.1 l b is 11 
Mbps, but typically wireless networks work at about 50 percent their stated 
www.syngress.com 

206 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
throughput, or around 6.5 megabits per second. The upside is that 802.11b is the 
most popular, widely available, and least expensive~and it offers decent coverage. 
802.11a is less common and never achieved the same acceptance as 802.11b. It 
operates in the 5-GHz spectrum and has 12 nonoverlapping channels instead of 3. As 
a result, it can't penetrate obstacles as well, and has a shorter range but higher speed. 
It is also less prone to interference because of the fact it is used on a frequency that 
is not clouded by other cordless devices such as phones and microwaves and is rela- 
tively unused-- however, this is changing. 
Finally, 802.1 l g was released in 2003 and took the speed of 802.1 l a at 54 Mbps 
(although there are faster techniques, such as frame bursting or packet bursting). It 
supports the OFDM and DSSS modulation. From a security standpoint, most wire- 
less network cards are compatible with 802.11b and g, and this is what's typically 
used in consumer devices.As a result, fewer cards can jump onto your 802.11a fre- 
quency because it can't operate at 5 GHz. This is quickly changing due to the 
802.1 lg standard, which is now able to operate at the 5-GHz frequency, meaning 
most wireless network cards are now compatible with 802.11a. However, relying on 
this mechanism alone is a poor method of keeping your wireless network secure. 
The 802.11n standard has been recently released to consumers (as of April 2006) 
and has speeds in excess of 300 Mbps. There are also others, such as 802.11h-w, that 
have specific functionality. However, unless you are out there designing complicated 
networks for multiple users on encrypted channels what you really need to under- 
stand in order to change the world is an understanding of a, b, and g, but mostly just 
b and g. 
Unauthorized Access 
Unauthorized access is a term used commonly in conjunction with wireless security 
and networking. It basically means that someone other than the owner and specified 
users of a network have been granted access. When it comes to basic users of wire- 
less devices, unauthorized access means that somehow a user has access to the 
Internet. The issue surrounding unauthorized access lies in the inherent flaws in the 
open licensing of the frequency itself. In order for companies to make devices that 
allowed regular people to connect their laptops and personal data assistants (PDAs) to 
the Internet, the process had to be as simple as possible. How simple? Automatic. The 
default settings on most wireless devices are to automatically connect when a net- 
work is present. This is usually true for wireless transmitters as well; their default set- 
ting is to give out connections. In the most basic terms, all wireless devices are made 
to connect to each other without interference from a human. This makes enforcing 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
207 
unauthorized access the responsibility of the installer or administrator of the wireless 
network. 
Social etiquette among wireless users is that if you did not set up the network or 
get explicit permission to access it~like a sign outside that says "Free Wireless"~ 
then do not connect. But not all owners of wireless devices are knowledgeable of 
the social norms of the computer geek. The best way to explain this is to let 
everyone know that unless they explicitly want to keep people out, they have given 
them an open door to the network and, essentially, authorized access. 
There are very simple steps anyone can take to lock down their network. The 
first is to understand what the wireless transmitter, wireless router, or access point 
does to grant connectivity. This is usually done by assigning the device an IP address. 
Turn this feature off and no one gets access. Putting in place some kind of autho- 
rization, whether a pass phrase or device filter is another way to do this. All of these 
measures can be done with little to no understanding of the technical workings of 
the technology because the manufacturers have created user interfaces that allow 
configuration with simple clicks. 
Eavesdropping 
Eavesdropping, sometimes referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack, is a big 
problem due to attackers being able to intercept 1KF communications between the 
transmitter and the wireless network card. This in turn could compromise the confi- 
dentiality or integrity of data. Eavesdropping is typically passive since you would 
never notice if someone was intercepting your traffic~until, that is, you find illicit 
charges on your credit card for the local Starbucks wireless network. For example, a 
common form of eavesdropping is packet sniffing. This typically transverses on a 
wired LAN and is easily readable with messages in clear text. Now the medium has 
changed and this can easily be done over a wireless network. 
Eavesdropping is essentially hacking (or in the perspective of a network adminis- 
trator "monitoring"). The reality is that because of the nature of the technology, 
devices are able to listen to the traffic on a network. There is hope for the security 
of wireless networking, but it comes from understanding the technical specifications, 
and balancing user experience, cost, and administration. The technology was built to 
be mobile and quickly used; it wasn't designed for security. 
Interference and Jamming 
Another major threat to your wireless network is interference. By their very nature, 
most wireless access points work on the 2.4-GHz 1KF signal (802.11b, 802.11g), and 
thus has to collaborate with many other devices. Whenever this happens 
www.syngress.com 

208 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
unfortunately because this is unlicensed by the FCC~many other devices can 
overlap on the channels your wireless access point is using. This is called interference. 
Most of the time it's unintentional, and this interference can be caused by high- 
power amateur, industrial, scientific, and military transmitters, microwave ovens, and 
more recently, your neighbor's wireless network. Ever experience a faint conversation 
going on in the background of your wireless telephone conversation? This is the 
same principle, except instead of your ear hearing the interference your wireless card 
is getting jumbled data. 
Though this connection may gain interference from intentional sources, in 
which they can jam the frequency range of the access point by either using a single 
channel or all of the channels. This jamming equipment is easily accessible to 
attackers on the Internet, although their use is typically illegal. Jamming occurs in 
high-density Wi-Fi areas like apartment complexes~for instance, a building may be 
three stories tall, with nearly everyone having a wireless access point of their own, 
resulting in many bad connections. If the wireless access points are open for anyone 
to connect to them, the wireless device will continuously hop around seeking the 
best connection. This results in poor network connectivity. 
Physical Threats 
Currently, the BBC airs a show called The 1T Crowd. In this sitcom about two guys 
in an IT department, the running joke is that when anyone calls they ask if the user 
has turned the system off and then back on again just before they hang up the 
phone or slam the door. The sad reality is that in so many cases when trou- 
bleshooting problems, the solution is to make sure the device is plugged in. 
A wireless network uses a wired network as its backbone. Thus, a disconnect of 
the physical wiring could render the wireless network useless. Also, wireless network 
infrastructure hardware relies on many things such as access points, the cabling to 
them, antennas that provide the coverage, and adapters of some sort. If any of these 
components are damaged, the wireless network will not operate effectively. Also, 
wireless infrastructure is susceptible to weather conditions, especially when wireless 
access points are outdoors. Other environmental factors are lightning strikes or water 
intrusion. Attackers can physically attack the access points by cutting its wires, power 
cables, or destroying its antennas. An attacker may also try to steal or compromise the 
wireless access point to gain access to the network. It is important to realize that 
attackers may be able to reset the access point to default settings and easily access the 
network since most access points are unsecured out of the box. At the university, I 
submitted a challenge to a group of network security students to hack a wireless 
video projector we had installed in the ceiling. The projector was to display informa- 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
209 
tion to students about projects that had been completed on campus the previous 
semester. The next day when I arrived on campus, the projector showed an image of 
the students on a ladder hitting the reset button on the back of the device. 
Sometimes it's that easy. 
802.11 Security 
Information security is the process by which digital information assets are protected, 
whether wireless or wired. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the guide- 
lines typically used in the information security field as baselines for security threats. 
These are the basic three, but more can be defined depending on what is important 
to the organization. Therefore, the goal of wireless network security is to keep the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information on the wireless network. 
Confidentiality 
Confidentiality is the projection of data from unauthorized disclosure to a third 
party. Whether it is customer data or internal company information, confidentiality 
must be protected. Majority of company's intellectual property and information 
needs to remain confidential from other competitors. Only authorized persons 
should have access to this information. For example, if you have an unsecured wire- 
less access point and you are a medical billing facility, you would have to adhere to 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPAA) that establishes 
national standards for health care information. If the company failed to provide con- 
fidentiality for customers' health records, then it could be subject to stiff penalties 
under U.S. law.You could be in violation of this if an attacker was easily able to con- 
nect to a wireless access point and read clear data containing this information. Some 
other federal requirements that companies have to adhere to are Sarbanes-Oxley, the 
Federal Information Security Management Act, and the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act. All require information technology controls, and, typically, unse- 
cured wireless networks violate these controls. 
Keeping information confidential is always difficult when working with humans 
and open technology. Humans like to talk; they love to be helpful, so if asked a 
question about anything they have knowledge about the chances of them telling 
you are high. The best practice for organizations that have sensitive data is to not 
allow that traffic to be sent over a wireless network. However, I am finding that 
many organizations feel that being mobile is more important than being secure. 
Take our university, for example~we have all of our administrators on a wireless 
network. This network uses encryption keys, MAC filtering, monitoring, static 
addressing, and various other methods of security, but that doesn't mean the traffic 
www.syngress.com 

210 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
is completely secure. It's difficult to gain access to it, but difficult does not mean 
impossible. For our users, the ability to be mobile is important to the culture and 
environment, but we are not working with anything other than grades and student 
numbers. Imagine if we were working on patented secrets. Is difficult enough to 
allow mobility? 
Integrity 
Integrity refers to the assurance that data isn't alerted or destroyed, whether this is in 
transit at the starting or ending point. Integrity is maintained when the message sent 
is identical to the message received. For example, you wouldn't care if someone 
could view the e-mail you were sending to your colleague, but if a third party 
changed this e-mail you might be upset. An example of this is a man-in-the-middle 
attack. The good news for home users is that attacks like these cannot happen acci- 
dentally. They are generated using sophisticated software and hardware by people 
who are patient and have the time and willpower to go through the trouble of inter- 
cepting your communications. If you are the type of neighbor who has brought this 
type of attack upon yourself, you are lucky that is all they are doing. 
All joking aside, this is a real threat to organizations transmitting information in 
public places. For example, I have seen groups of people in the hotel lobby bar 
checking important e-mails, sending directions to subordinates, and negotiating land 
deals. Think about the kind of information that passes through the radio frequencies 
with every type of conference in hotels. Interception is possible and could be dan- 
gerous. It is important when using and administering wireless connectivity to users 
that they be aware of the potential risks when outside the confines of the office and 
be sensitive of what information is sent, and how. 
Availability 
Availability is defined as the continuous operation of information technology sys- 
tems. An IT system should always be available to the user, and security controls must 
always adhere to making the service available. A common opposite of availability is a 
Denial-of-Service attack. Different services or applications have different availability 
levels according to how critical the business process is. In order to be available, the 
application must have continuous service when it is needed. This is important 
because if these systems are down it can cost business valuable revenue. It may also 
result in a lack of credibility and low customer satisfaction. Think about when your 
cell phone loses it signal. What if it was your wireless access points that kept drop- 
ping out on you? 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
211 
As mentioned before, methods exist for decreasing the availability of a wireless 
network through interference and loss of connectivity to the physical network. 
Environmental factors may also hinder service in outdoor wireless networks, and it is 
the goal of the network administrator to take these factors into account and monitor 
the conditions. Going back to the real purpose of this information, which is to 
increase the sophistication of wireless users, how do we talk about "availability" to 
average nontechnical users? I have found over the last few years that listening to the 
language of the layperson can reveal symptoms that lead to fundamental problems. 
The following are some terms I often hear from nontechnical consumers to describe 
inconsistent availability in wireless networks. 
"My Internet" is down. In this case, "My Internet" usually refers to the browser 
not loading Web pages. As avid computer users, we instantly begin troubleshooting 
this in our minds, but to a nontechnical user this is baffling. However, this is different 
from when the same person says "My Wireless" is down. Nontechnical users that 
have a wireless network in their homes can usually tell when their computer has not 
acquired an IP address. In nine cases out of ten, it is because in newer laptops they 
have a switch for the wireless network card on the machine and this has been turned 
off. Other times it's usually caused by overload on the access point or router, which 
simply needs to be rebooted. Oh, if managing an enterprise network were easy, life 
would be grand. 
The point here is that knowing the terms and technical specifications of a tech- 
nology does not make you helpful to users that need your expertise. We, too, must 
be sensitive to their language and understanding of how the technology works so we 
can praise, redirect, and reprimand their understanding of" wireless technology to 
make everyone more secure and yet do so with increased availability. 
Goals of Network Security 
One of the most important goals of network security is to achieve a state where any 
action not expressly permitted is prohibited. We can accomplish this by under- 
standing the expectations of our organizational leaders and users, developing com- 
munications that clearly explain desired performance, and show how to prevent and 
respond to incidents that occur. As security professionals, we want to ensure that the 
devices on our network are operated by authorized personnel, that the data is secure, 
and that all of it is invisible and effortless to the users. Typing a 24-character pass- 
word versus four characters every time a user needs to access a different data system 
or access point will, over time, deter the user from using that system. It will also 
greatly decrease productivity. The cost for stronger authentication or encryption 
mechanisms is high and perceived as a hassle, such as using passwords and tokens 
www.syngress.com 

212 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
simultaneously. The support involved in troubleshooting users with hardware- and 
software-based tokens on a wireless network requires a full-time helpdesk at many 
organizations. Most companies and consumers aren't able to afford the expertise, 
software, and long-term maintenance costs of keeping a secure wireless network 
available 24 hours a day. 
An information security program is based on experienced staff, good policies, 
procedures, training, awareness, management support, and its implementation from 
the highest level of the organization. This is typically called the top-down approach. 
Good information security is also based on a sound technical information security 
architecture utilizing the correct products in the correct locations on the network. 
Senior leadership is one of the most effective tools in preventing security chaos in an 
organization. A good CIO responsible for implementing an effective organizational 
information security program that propagates to all individuals can be the best 
investment an organization with mobile users can make. 
Having an organizational hierarchy is immensely effective in improving the 
information security posture of the corporation. Having a hierarchy allows senior 
management to effectively enforce policies and procedures, which in turn spreads 
throughout the entire organization. Policies and procedures typically make up 85 
percent of the security posture of an organization. Effectively enforcing these policies 
and procedures of the organizational information security program greatly dissemi- 
nates risk to an organization's information assets and lowers their overall information 
security posture, thus decreasing the risk of wireless network security fallibilities. 
I have to admit that the preceding paragraph is the standard model of good prac- 
tice. Personally, I do not like hierarchies and believe in flat organizations that are 
managed by a discipline of skill sets that are natural to the leaders in the organiza- 
tion, and that technology should be coddled and promoted as an enhancement to 
life, work, and freedom. In our organization, everyone is responsible for making 
good decisions about security and we are not driven by a hierarchy of policies and 
procedures that flow from the top down, but practices that are constantly evolving 
based on the need of the users and organizational goals. Our security administrator 
has the final say in information security, but with input from many divisions to bal- 
ance usability and risk. 
Security Ramifications 
When the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a business, organization, or 
consumer are compromised, they usually must incur some costs to mitigate the con- 
sequences of the attack. The basics are simple: if there is a problem, it is due to weak- 
nesses in the technology, configuration, or policy, or is a result of human error. This 

Wireless Awareness" Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
213 
is typically when authors will begin unleashing the terror and instill fear into users 
employing every worst-case scenario ever told about identity theft, bandwidth loss, 
and holding companies hostage over their critical information. While there are risks 
and the stories are true, our goal is to increase the sophistication of wireless users at 
the residential and consumer level, not necessarily the corporate and organizational 
level. They have resources to mitigate risk, but what about your neighbor? 
The real threat to the average home wireless user is that they will make them- 
selves vulnerable to having their financial data exposed and will have to go through 
the pain and hassle of clearing that data up. I had my identity compromised and it 
was a nightmare getting all of my bank accounts and bills back in order. I can 
empathize, but that does not deter me from being mobile or having a wireless net- 
work at home. It makes me check my accounts more often and set up alerts where 
available, but I do not fear the technology or the people out there. That is our role in 
communicating security ramifications. 
Several times since working with this initiative, I have talked about incentives: 
both for wireless users and for hackers. There is no real incentive for hackers to hack 
into home networks because there is no real value there. The value that an open net- 
work of a residential home has is bandwidth, a gateway to get to the real informa- 
tion. Stealing the account information of a person in suburbia usually doesn't result 
in a worthwhile payoff to the criminal. 
Human Factors 
Keeping with the idea of incentives, humans are the reason technology continually 
evolves. The idea is that the more we integrate our lives with technology, the more 
human we want to be. We want to be able to meet face to face at a coffee shop or 
book store and build relationships and still be connected, to the phone, to e-mail, 
and to information. Humans will drive technology and I find it comical when tech- 
nology tries to dictate how people will use it. We see this with the Internet, wireless 
devices, TiVo, and all kinds of technologies that people have taken a liking to. 
Technology gets in the hands of people and they use it, but the administrators and 
engineers sometimes interfere by saying, "You can't use this wireless network; you 
can't record a movie and watch it as many times as you want; you can't make that 
information available to people; and you surely cannot download it without my per- 
mission." All of these actions show technology trying to dictate human behavior 
instead of realizing that humans create technology to make life the way they want it, 
and not to be controlled by technology.

214 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
So what do we do as security professionals, technology innovators, and adminis- 
trators to ensure that humans can have access to these networks while at the same 
time protecting the information that travels across such technologies? 
The human factor must be considered when implementing a wireless network at 
home and in the workplace. Security that forces people into a policy, and procedures 
that create environments of fear also create a breeding ground for revolt. Balance, 
training, and communication are the key to managing the human factor of your 
wireless network 
Knowing Your Weaknesses 
No matter how secure your system is, it will always have weaknesses. The radio fre- 
quency technology we are using is weak, which is why it is unlicensed.You should 
attack your own system to determine where your weaknesses are located. Of course, 
if you do not know how to hack or you don't understand the technology, how can 
you do this? Know the areas that offer the largest threat to your system and mitigate 
that risk. Determine the level of security for the level risk, and then develop or use a 
methodology for testing to ensure your system remains safe. For example, if your 
wireless access point handles credit card transactions, make sure you have made every 
opportunity to mitigate all risk to them system instead of focusing on a public 
Internet computer. 
When working with people with little knowledge of the technology, understand 
that their lack of knowledge is a weakness. In organizations, we protect critical data, 
our products, and our services against competitors. For residential users, we simply 
ask them to protect their network like they do their house or car~you lock it to 
deter people from entering. Locks can be broken, cars can be stolen, and wireless 
traffic can be intercepted~thus, due diligence is the key. For houses and cars, indus- 
tries have risen to mitigate risk. They are called insurance companies. Even now, 
identity theft insurance is available because of inherent flaws in the technology. 
Limiting Access 
Not everyone needs access to the wireless access point in your network, and some 
may need more access than others. Public users don't need to access your network! 
Take the necessary steps to make it as difficult as possible for outsiders to gain access, 
and as simple as possible for permitted users to work without being tethered to the 
wall. 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
215 
Persistence Achieves Security 
A persistent, well-documented chain management process is important. Whenever 
there is a network upgrade, whether patches, new users, firewall updates, or new 
access control lists, they should be well documented. Methodically written pro- 
cesses are best. Be persistent with your users so that they are well informed of the 
information security policies. Add banners to wireless network connectivity with a 
legal disclaimer "for authorized use only," and give a link to your information 
security policy. Make it a point to patch systems and devices as often as possible 
and communicate all changes as best you can in terms that users can understand. 
Remember, information technology is not taught as part of our required educa- 
tion. It is unrealistic to expect all users to understand the language and architecture 
of network technology. 
Physical Security 
One of the most basic and overlooked ways of securing a wireless network is to 
physically secure the access point (AP). This can be done by placing the access point 
in a secure location, such as a locked room, that has limited access. By preventing 
unauthorized personnel from reaching the access point, a layer of security is created. 
Another basic approach to securing a wireless local area network (WLAN) is to 
ensure that no additional unauthorized access points are added to the network. This 
is to prevent unauthorized access to the network through an AP that is not config- 
ured securely. In a corporate setting, employees should be notified of this practice. 
Once the AP has been physically secured, it is important to configure it properly. 
Configuring it includes the process of setting authentication/encryption measures. 
By preventing unauthorized personnel from reaching the access point, a layer of 
security is created. When doing so, it is also important to set a secure password for 
the access point so it cannot be logged into remotely by unauthorized individuals. 
The reality is that in homes and many small business offices, the access point is 
sitting out in the open, on a desk, or near the Internet connection. There are usually 
one or two access points to provide better coverage or to support more users, and 
focus is given to protecting the data in the air and not at the AP. Nevertheless, pro- 
tecting the access point should be considered. 
Perimeter Security 
A critical starting point in implementing network security is to create a strong net- 
work perimeter that protects internal resources from threats outside the organiza- 
tion. These threats can come from the Internet, external businesses, or users 
www.syngress.com 

216 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness" Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
connecting to your network. Anything that connects to your network is a risk. To 
alleviate many of these risks, a strong network perimeter must be created to block 
out undesirable traffic, especially on your wireless access point. For example, a wire- 
less network point should never access a network backbone directly, or any place 
that is transferring a heavy amount of confidential data, or that has access to impor- 
tant servers, data, and so on. In this case, an excellent example of good perimeter 
security is that when a user authenticates to the access point, he can only access 
things like the Internet, and nothing internally. Then, once he wants to access busi- 
ness critical servers or data, he could then use a virtual private network to success- 
fully log into the critical network in which the connection could then be entirely 
encrypted and secured by multiple authentication algorithms. Also, this should be 
used with a three-tiered architecture that's located in a semi-trusted network and 
then VPN into the trusted network. It shouldn't be placed in an untrusted network 
since it could be susceptible to Internet attacks. 
The Radiation Zone 
Unlike a traditional wired network in a corporation or home where a security team 
or locked door can prevent access to the system, a wireless network has the access 
pointability to extend its range outside the walls of the building. This creates the 
potential risk of unauthorized access to the network from outside the building (such 
as in an alley or parking lot). 
The area in which the radio signals from an access point are usable is known as 
the radiation zone. When a wireless network transmits data, it does so over a radio 
frequency. Many things can obstruct the radio frequencies, such as steel, walls, and 
other devices in the area. A number of steps can be taken to lower the risk. Many 
access points allow their antenna to be positioned. This can be done to direct the 
I1 
signal from the access point away from unused areas. This may contribute to 
reducing the visibility of the network, but some security experts still warn against 
using this as a form of security. 
There are companies that have designed products to stop a wireless signal from 
radiating outside of a building. Force Field Wireless of Sunnyvale, California sells 
DefendAir paint, which contains copper filings as well as aluminum. The company 
claims that the paint will greatly reduce the emission of wireless signals. The com- 
pany also sells "Window Shield," which is attached to windows and serves roughly 
the same purpose. A significant problem with both of these methods is that it also 
blocks other radio signals, including those of broadcast radio, cell phones, and tele- 
vision. 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
217 
While physically securing the network is an important step to enforcing the 
security of the overall network, it is still only a single step towards fully securing the 
network. For any network that will be transmitting sensitive data, including home 
networks that transmit credit and banking information, it is still important to utilize 
some form of authentication and encryption. 
Firewalls 
A firewall is a hardware or software solution that contains programs designed to 
enforce an organization's security polices by restricting access to specific network 
resources. The firewall creates a protective layer between the network and the 
external networks. It is used in the three-tier layer and replicates the network at the 
point of entry so it can receive and transmit authorized data without much delay. Its 
filters either allow or deny data from entering, and firewalls log any attempted intru- 
sions and alarm the owner. 
Outside of securing the access point, another important part of securing a net- 
work is to have a firewall. Those packets or bits of data that do not meet the security 
policy are discarded and aren't allowed into the internal network. A firewall serves as 
yet another method of preventing unauthorized access to an internal network. 
Additionally, if the sole purpose of an access point is to allow wireless Internet con- 
nectivity, with no need for access to the internal network, then the access point can 
be installed on the outside of the network, with a firewall between it and the 
internal network. Demilitarized zones, or DMZs, are areas that allow access typically 
to external networks without sacrificing unauthorized access to its private network. 
This is typically in the semi-trusted layer. Typically, a DMZ contains Web servers, 
mail servers, and so on. It is known as the neutral zone between a private network 
and an outside network and keeps outside users from getting direct access to an 
important server on a private network. This further helps to protect the network and 
can be used with a virtual private network. 
Ad-Hoc and Infrastructure Modes 
Two modes can be used to operate in a wireless connection in 802.11: ad-hoc mode 
and infrastructure mode (also called an IBSS, where the network's card works peer- 
to-peer and no wireless access points are used in the topology~for example, two 
computers directly communicating with each other over 802.11b). From a security 
aspect, ad-hoc mode can be a security problem because if they were simultaneously 
hooked up using a wired connection, then at any time they could be considered a 
wireless access point and give anyone unsecured access unknowingly. 
www.syngress.com 

218 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
In infrastructure mode, a wireless user is always connected to a wireless 
access point and a wireless provider with a direct connection to a wired infrastruc- 
ture such as Ethernet. All communication occurs through the access point--never 
through any peers. Multiple wireless network access points that work together are 
typically called a Basic Service Set (BSS), while a multiple BSS is called an ESS. This 
is typically a security problem, because if one access point gets compromised, a 
whole basic service set or extended service set can be compromised, which will give 
the attacker an even greater range to access the network. Whenever a client connects 
to an access point, it has to know the Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the network 
and then authenticate and associate in whichever of three relationships exist: unau- 
thenticated and unassociated, authenticated and unassociated, or authenticated and 
associated. In security, 100 percent of the time we want to make sure the client is 
successfully authenticated and associated. 
The SSID 
The SSID is essentially the name of the access point or wireless network seen by the 
user. There are only two ways a client can know their SSID: it can be told by the 
access point actively, or you can passively put it in the client's configuration. When it 
is given out automatically, it is called Open Network mode, but is known as Closed 
Network mode when "cloaking," meaning the SSID is not broadcast over the radio 
frequency. The automatic giving out of the SSID occurs typically every 100 millisec- 
onds and is called a beacon, within which is contained synchronization information 
such as channel, speeds, timestamps, encryption status, and other information. 
In Closed Network mode, the SSID is not broadcast out to the user or adminis- 
trator programs. Thus, the client must probe the access point, and if the SSID 
matches, it will synchronize and go through the authentication process. 
Authentication can occur using an open system or shared key authentication. An 
open system does not need any credentials supplied. The SSID is used in wireless 
networks to identify the wireless access point and its associated network. It can be 
up to 32 alphanumeric characters long and is attached to all packets sent over the 
wireless connection.Additional access points in the area can broadcast the same 
SSID, so its use as a security or authentication method is negligible. However, the 
SSID may be changed and cloaked (meaning it is not set to be broadcast by the AP) 
in an attempt to minimize the visibility of the network. By default, most APs broad- 
cast their SSIDs to the surrounding area. This beacon method occurs roughly every 
0.1 seconds. Most APs ship with a default SSID (see Table 7.1). These defaults are 
widely known and can be found on a number of Internet sites. Using a default SSID 
may draw malicious users who suspect that additional settings on the AP are set to 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
219 
default settings as well (such as the administrative password). From a security stand- 
point, changing the SSID may cause some possible attackers to choose a wireless 
network that uses default settings. Changing the SSID is reasonably simple for a 
nontechnical user, and though minor, is a step toward securing the AP. It is impor- 
tant to note that disabling the broadcast of the SSID does not completely cloak the 
AP. It simply makes it less visible. Nevertheless, it is still an important step in low- 
ering the risk of unauthorized access by reducing the visible footprint of the net- 
work.

Virtual Private Networks 
A virtual private network (VPN) is a method of creating a secure network connec- 
tion between two devices through a nonsecure network. This can often be found on 
the Internet when an individual at their home connects to the corporate network at 
their job site. By using encryption, the communication remains secure, even though 
it is being sent over an insecure network. It is important to note that by using a 
VPN an individual may connect to the main network over an unsecured wireless 
connection and is secure in the fact that any data they may transfer is indeed safe 
over an encrypted session. 
Radius Servers 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) provides a client/server 
security system. Any communications server or network hardware that supports the 
RADIUS client protocols can communicate with the server. RADIUS is a system of 
distributed security. It includes two pieces: an authentication server and client proto- 
cols. The server is typically on the corporate LAN and is designed to simplify the 
security process by separating security technology from communications technology. 
The information is forwarded to a RADIUS authentication server that validates the 
user and returns the information necessary for the access server to initiate a session 
www.syngress.com 

220 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
with the user. In 1997, the RADIUS protocol was designed by Livingston 
Enterprises, Inc. When connecting to an ISP or other network that utilizes 
RADIUS, the connecting point is known as a network access server (NAS). The 
device wishing to be authenticated sends its authenticating information to the NAS 
via PPP (point-to-point protocol). Then, the authentication request is forwarded to 
the RADIUS server using the RADIUS protocol.After attempting authentication, 
the RADIUS server either grants or denies the connection. If the authentication is 
successful, then the authenticated device is granted access to the greater network, 
which is typically the corporate local area network. 
The RADIUS packet is encapsulated in a stateless UDP data stream that is 
addressed with the destination ports 1812, 1813, and 1814 representing access, 
accounting, and proxying, respectively. Packets consist of multiple elements, code, 
identifiers, length, and authenticator and attribute elements. 
In a RADIUS packet, the code element identifies the type of the RADIUS 
packet. The different packet types are shown next. The identifier element allows the 
client to match a RADIUS server response with the correct request. The length ele- 
ment indicates the length of the RADIUS message. It also represents the corre- 
sponding sum of the code, identifier, length, authenticator, and attribute fields. The 
authenticator element is used to authenticate and verify replies from the RADIUS 
server. It also serves to hide the password. The two values that can be found in the 
authenticator element are request and response. The final element of a RADIUS 
packet is the attribute element. Six of them classify the characteristics and behavior 
patterns of the service. 
Further details on the process of RADIUS authentication are warranted. When a 
user attempts to obtain authentication, the query sent from the NAS to the 
RADIUS server is an Access-Request packet. The corresponding response will either 
be an Access-Accept or Access-Reject packet. To decide whether to accept, and 
choose how to respond to, the Access-Request packet, the RADIUS server searches 
a database for the supplied credentials. If it does not find that account, then an 
Access-Reject packet is sent. This will often be accompanied by a text message to 
explain the reason for the authentication failing. If the credentials exist in the 
database, then an Access-Accept response is sent. Included in that response is a list of 
attribute values that describe the parameters of the session. This typically includes the 
service type, protocol type, and IP address assigned to that user. 
RADIUS authentication allows for a number of different mechanisms to be used 
in authentication. These methods include varying protocols, such as PAP (Password 
Authentication Protocol), CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication protocol), as 
well as other authentication methods like PAMs (Pluggable Authentication 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
221 
Modules), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and SQL (Structured 
Query Language). 
The authentication protocols and methods previously given deserve further anal- 
ysis. CHAP is a procedure similar to Shared key Authentication, which is detailed 
within this CHAP pointer. Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a simple 
authentication protocol, which as a security measure performs poorly because it 
transmits the password information in unencrypted ASCII format over the network. 
Pluggable Authentication Protocol (PAM) has the ability to integrate login capabili- 
ties of different authentication mechanisms through the same framework, thus pro- 
viding greater compatibility with authentication methods. The method used in the 
ISP example can be extended to a wireless network. In this case, the access point is 
connected to a RADIUS server. The access point forwards authentication requests to 
the RADIUS server to obtain authentication. If authentication is granted, then the 
wireless device is allowed access to the network. 
Configuration Weaknesses 
Many security problems are often caused by configuration weaknesses, especially in 
access points. A common problem in misconfiguration is unsecured accounts. User 
accounts may sometimes be transmitted insecurely if the wireless access point is not 
set up right, therefore exposing usernames and passwords to attackers. In addition, 
these system accounts typically have weak passwords, or passwords that can be 
broken or guessed with ease. Very unsecure passwords are those that are easy to 
crack. It is recommended you use an alphanumeric password with capital letters and 
special characters, and that it be at least 16 characters. The longer the password, the 
better the protection. Another thing that is common is misconfiguration of services 
on the access point. A common problem is to allow for remote administration 
through a Web browser. This should only be activated if necessary; otherwise, it 
should be deactivated. In residential areas that have dense wireless populations, users 
that are connected to a nearby access point of the same make and type can be 
accessed using the same credentials, and the users may not realize they are not even 
accessing their personal access point. An access point should never use the default 
password since it is a simple process to find the default password for an access point 
online. When doing so, it is also important to set a secure password for the access 
point so it cannot be logged into remotely by unauthorized individuals. 
Some wireless access points also have default passwords or no passwords at all. 
This should be changed immediately, as soon as you configure them. These are 
known as default settings, and these default settings typically permit security holes 
such as an access point that does not secure itself. Another common problem of con- 
www.syngress.com 

222 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
figuration weaknesses is misconfigured network services. For example, you should 
not start Telnet on your wireless access point since all information is sent in clear 
text and a hacker could easily intercept the password when an administrator logs 
into it. 
In our study of the Phoenix area, we found nearly 80,000 access points using 
their default configurations. 
Policy Weaknesses 
Many security problems exist because there is a lack of policy. If there is a lack of a 
written security policy, security cannot be consistently applied or enforced. Office 
politics can play a big roll in this issue~for instance, if you do not have management 
support of the policy from the top down, your policy can't be enforced and will be 
ineffective. Businesses that lack continuity cannot implement policy evenly, and fre- 
quently replacing personnel leads to difficulty in enforcing security. Many policies 
have concise access controls that are not applied, are poorly chosen, easily cracked, or 
that use default passwords that could allow unauthorized access to your wireless access 
point. For example, if your policy is to use a minimum four-character password, it 
will be overwhelmingly ineffective as a network security policy.Your software and 
hardware changes should always follow policy and there should be no exceptions. If 
your information security policy is enforced, unauthorized changes to the wireless 
access point should not be an issue, and security holes will not be created. 
Finally, always have a disaster recovery plan. If the plan is nonexistent, it can lead 
to chaos, panic, and confusion if an attack or outage occurs. Always have a backup 
plan. Wireless networks are increasingly being used in disaster areas due to their 
tremendous scalability and feasibility. This does not just apply to businesses but resi- 
dential users as well. If your only access to the Internet is your laptop and wireless 
router, then a loss to either can be painful, difficult, and expensive to recover from. A 
good rule to follow is that 100 percent of all technology will fail. Keep that in mind 
when investing and relying on wireless network technology. 
Human Error 
Lastly, as with everything, human error is a major cause of information security 
breaches. Well-intentioned users can cause great harm to information technology 
systems without even knowing it. Unfortunately, hackers and criminals prey on 
unsuspecting users and typically use social engineering tactics to gain information to 
access networks. Excessive IT workload is another problem many companies face 
that helps bring down their corporate guard. Dishonesty is also an issue, due to 
humans wanting to commit fraud, theft, or sell intellectual property. A major cause of 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
223 
hacking or attacks is disgruntled employees. Those who have been fired, laid off, or 
reprimanded may intentionally infect the network or hack it, or release confidential 
information~for example, giving out the wireless access code to people so they can 
enter the company network and steal information. 
The reality is that people are generally trusting, and if asked a question that they 
have the answer to, they will give it up, especially over the phone or in casual con- 
versation. This is why communication and education to users is essential. In addition, 
the communication and training must be geared to the language and skill set of the 
user, and not use the nomenclature of the technologically proficient. 
Legal Liability 
As with many things, there are some downsides to wireless access points, especially if 
they are freely open to the public. Typically, they can be used for illegal or immoral 
activities, and as stated earlier, this is one of the main reasons for a hacker to attack 
your wireless access point. If a perpetrator is doing illegal things on your network, 
such as hacking, launching viruses, e-mail fraud, and stealing credit cards, chances are 
law enforcement can easily track it back to the originating access point. All that 
stands in the way is a subpoena to an Internet service provider to obtain all log 
information on the victim's account activity. Any good forensic work will typically 
tell if you are the culprit or not. Many consumers and businesses would rather not 
deal with this hassle, so it's important they have a secure network. Also, there can be 
some liability involved. For example, if you are running a community free wireless 
network and a person downloads a lot of illegal music, and so forth, you could have 
a lawsuit waiting at your door from the Recording Industry Association of America 
or the Business Software Alliance, demanding you repay them for lost revenue since 
you were providing the Internet access to the perpetrators and were neglectful to 
monitor the content. To protect an open public network, you could implement a 
term of service agreement where the user would have to agree to abide by these 
terms in order to use the Internet. That would at least cover some of your legal lia- 
bility. But once the damage is done and the actions are in the hands of lawyers, a 
term of service agreement will not do you much good. 
It is best that when investing in, and implementing, a wireless network that is 
open to the public that steps be taken to mitigate risk to the owners, and yet have 
usability be considered for the clients. We can not go through life fearing the infor- 
mation on the Net, or the cases on the docket for review. Instead, we must educate, 
inform, and behave above reproach at all times, while expecting nothing less from 
our users.

Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
Technology Weaknesses 
Wireless access points have intrinsic security weaknesses in the following areas. 
Hardware and MAC Addresses 
With few exceptions, network devices contain a physically unique burned-in Media 
Access Control address (MAC address). The purpose of this is to give a unique iden- 
tifier to that piece of equipment. It is pre-assigned to the devices by its manufac- 
turer, and in theory is completely unique. In most cases, the MAC address is 48 bits 
long. A standard format exists for writing MAC addresses, which consist of three 
groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by dots. The more common method of 
writing is to use six groups of two hexadecimal digits, which are in turn separated 
by colons or hyphens~for example, 00-07-E9-E3-84-F9. 
Since each MAC address is unique, it can be used to limit network access. The 
steps to do so will vary by access point, but will always involve the following: 
9 
Finding the MAC address for the devices that will be allowed to access the 
network (this can be found either by looking on the actual device itself, or 
by using the ipconfi2 ~all command in the Windows command console, and 
ifconfig- a for Linux and OSX consoles). 
9 
Entering the MAC address into the configuration for the access point (this 
will vary by device). 
In theory, once the MAC addresses are entered into the access point, they will be 
the only devices allowed to access the network. In practice, a number of issues can 
come up, including, but not limited to, the fact that any time a new system is used in 
conjunction with the access point (such as a visiting client who needs to connect to 
the network), its MAC address must be entered individually into the access point. 
This can pull the network administrator away from other tasks of monitoring the 
network. The administrator must also periodically remove the information for 
devices that are no longer being used. 
Another problem that exists is that of MAC address spoofing. While the address 
is typically encoded to the physical medium of the network device, software exists 
that can make a device access point have a different MAC address than it actually 
does. While this does have legitimate and useful purposes, including privacy and 
interoperability, it can also be changed to access a system illegally. Because of this 
large security hole, MAC address filtering should not be used by itself, and should 
instead be included in a wider security policy involving encryption and other 
authentication methods.

802.11 Authentication 
Authentication is the process of determining whether someone using the wireless 
network is who or what they declare to be. This is typically done with a technical 
mechanism. 
The basic requirements for authentication in a wireless LAN are 
9 A robust method providing identity that cannot be spoofed 
9 
A method of preserving the identity of subsequent transactions that cannot 
be transferred 
9 
Mutual authentication 
9 Authentication keys independent from encryption (and other) keys 
Ideally, an authentication system for a wireless network should encompass all of 
the preceding ideas. Unfortunately, a method of this type has yet to be successfully 
implemented. It is also important for the authentication process to be repeated on a 
regular basis to ensure that the correct devices are still communicating. 
There are several methods of authentication available for 802.11 networks. While 
they vary in their methods and effectiveness, the 802.1x standard has helped improve 
the security of Ethernet networks by requiring that network devices be authenti- 
cated before opening a communications port. Regardless of the method of authenti- 
cation, its type is always transmitted in the flame body of the 802.11 media access 
control flame, and when sending frames to the access point to request authentica- 
tion, the flames will almost always follow the same format. 
Algorithm Number, Transaction 
Sequence, Status Code, and Challenge Text 
The algorithm number simply indicates the form of authentication. A 0 is sent when 
Open System Authentication is used, and a 1 is sent when Shared Key 
Authentication is used. The transaction sequence number simply indicates the cur- 
rent step. The status code shows the final status of the authentication request, and the 
pass-phrase text is only sent when using a shared key. 
Open System Authentication 
The first and simplest method is known as Open System Authentication, and is the 
default method of authentication for the 802.11 standard. It essentially authenticates 
anyone who requests to be authenticated, which makes it a weak security method. It 
involves a two-step process of authentication. First, the device that wishes to asso- 
www.syngress.com 

226 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
ciate with an access point sends a flame to the AP, giving its station ID and making a 
request for authentication. Once the authenticating device receives this request, it 
does one of two things. It either authenticates the device and sends a success message 
back to the point of origination, thus causing both stations to be mutually authenti- 
cated, or it sends a failure response and the authentication fails. 
Open System Authentication provides little in the way of security. But it is not 
entirely without use, it does let two devices connect easily to each other. Additionally, 
it can be used with other authentication methods, such as MAC filtering. 
Shared Key Authentication 
Shared Key Authentication provides a more secure method of authenticating a 
device before it gains access to the network. It is built on the assumption that the 
devices authenticating each other share a common key. This key is either a 40-bit or 
104-bit key in the form of 10 or 26 hex characters. The key is distributed to each 
station individually and not over the network. In WEP networks, the key is entered 
manually at each station, at the access point, and the client device. 
The authentication process that follows is quite similar to that of Open System 
Authentication. Its differences are best demonstrated visually using a picture. 
Once the access point receives an authentication request, it responds with a pass- 
phrase text, which is sent in plaintext format and is created using the WEP Pseudo 
Random Number Generator. The station requesting authentication then encrypts 
the challenge text using the key assigned to it, and sends the encrypted response 
back to the access point. Upon receiving the response, the access point decrypts the 
message and compares it to the original challenge text. If they match, it responds to 
the client acknowledging that it has been authenticated. Otherwise, the access point 
responds by rejecting authentication. This method of authentication is also known as 
CHaccess point (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol). This is the method 
of authentication used in networks that utilize WEE which is further discussed later 
in this chapter. 
802.1x was originally designed for wired networks. The methods were imple- 
mented into the wireless standard with the introduction of 802.1 li Like RADIUS, 
EAP point is not an actual authentication method. Instead, it supplies a framework in 
which to perform authentication. It is often found in wireless networks. 
There are three significant benefits to using EAP point over standard 802.11 
security methods. With EAP point, both the client and the server authenticate each 
other, removing the problem of what is known as a man-in-the-middle attack. 
Another benefit is that EAP point provides for centralized management and distri- 
bution of encryption keys~thus, saving time and effort if a device is lost.Yet another 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
227 
benefit is that EAP point allows centralized policy control, providing for re-authenti- 
cation any time a session times out. 
According to the 802.1x standard, the network is broken into three separate 
entities. 
9 
The supplicant, which is the device wishing to access the network 
9 
The authenticator, which controls access 
9 
The Authentication server, which makes authorization decisions 
Because EAP point is only a framework, a multitude of methods for using EAP 
point exist. Among them are LEAP point (Lightweight Extensible Authentication 
Protocol), EAP point-TLS (Transportation Layer Security), PEAP point (Protected 
EAP point), and EAP point-TTLS (Tunneled Transportation Layer Security). While 
each version uses slightly different methods, the overall process remains roughly the 
same. 
LEAP Point 
The Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a proprietary version 
of EAP point developed by Cisco Systems. Cisco LEAP point is the widely deployed 
EAP point type in use today in WLANs. LEAP point supports all three of the 
802.1X and EAP point elements mentioned previously. With LEAP point, mutual 
authentication relies on a shared secret, the user's logon password, which is known 
by the client and the network. The RADIUS server sends an authentication chal- 
lenge to the client. The client uses a one-way hash of the user-supplied password to 
fashion a response to the challenge and sends that response to the RADIUS server. 
Using information from its user database, the RADIUS server creates its own 
response and compares that to the response from the client. When the RADIUS 
server authenticates the client, the process repeats in reverse, enabling the client to 
authenticate the RADIUS server. When this is complete, an EAP point-Success 
message is sent to the client, and both the client and the RADIUS server derive the 
dynamic WEP key. 
SSL/TLS 
Transport Security Layer (TLS) is the successor to the Secure Socket Layer protocol 
(SSL), which has become a standard for Internet-based transactions. SSL was origi- 
nally designed by Netscape Corporation as a method of authenticating a Web site so 
a user could perform a secure transaction. Based on the use of digital certificates, 
SSL allows for both the client computer and the host Web site to authenticate each 
www.syngress.com 

228 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
other using digital certificates. Often times, however, only the Web server has a dig- 
ital certificate, relying on the user to instead authenticate themselves via use of a 
password or with credit card information. SSL was designed as a proprietary tech- 
nology, even though it was also licensed to other browsers. As a result of the desire to 
have an open version of SSL, TLS is a standardized nonproprietary version of SSL, 
but unlike SSL it does not deal with browser security. Instead, it builds on the 
TCP/IP and transport layers of the OSI model. 
The structure of the Transport Layer Security protocol is split into two protocol 
groups: the TLS Record Protocol and the TLS Handshake protocol. To briefly sum- 
marize them, the Record Protocol is a layered protocol that includes fields for length 
description and content. Messages to be transmitted are fragmented by the Record 
Protocol into smaller, more manageable blocks. The data is then compressed (if so 
desired), given a message authentication code (MAC), and then encrypted and sent. 
Once the message is received, the opposite process occurs and the data is delivered 
to the layers above the Transport layer. 
Some of the information needed for the Record Protocol is received through 
the TLS Handshake protocol. Through the handshake protocol, the rules of the con- 
nection are decided upon by the communicating systems. Another important action 
performed by the Handshake protocol is to decide which form of encryption will 
be used. 
Kerberos Authentication 
Kerberos is another available authentication method. Evolving continuously from its 
original version, it was designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It 
allows for credential information to be embedded into a "ticket" that can then be 
used to access services over the network. Additionally, it can encrypt the authentica- 
tion information within the ticket, preventing a number of possible attacks, as well as 
ensuring data integrity. Though not directly specified in the 802.11 protocol, 
Kerberos can be utilized over a wireless network using EAP point. 
One security weakness in Kerberos is the fact that the point of access to the net- 
work must share a secret with the Key Distribution Center. Additionally, the method 
of sending the encrypted password with some fields in plain text allows for the pos- 
sibility of a dictionary-based brute-force attack. 
802.11 Security (Encryption) 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an optional security feature that was specified by 
the 802.11 protocol to provide authentication and confidentiality in a wireless access 
point. It was one of the original methods of sending secure information using a 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
229 
wireless network. When the IEEE committee recommended WEP be used as a 
mechanism, it also said that WEP should not be considered an adequate security and 
strongly recommended that it not be used without an authentication process for key 
management. WEP employs a symmetric key to authenticate wireless devices and 
guarantee the integrity of the data by encrypting the transmissions. Each wireless 
access point and client must share the same key in order for authentication to take 
place. Once WEP has been enabled, it then begins a challenge and response authen- 
tication process. WEP encrypts data before it is sent from the system, and then 
decrypts it at the access point. It has been shown to be severely inadequate in its 
security methods, and as such was replaced as the wireless encryption method of 
choice in 2003. It uses the stream cipher 1KC4 (1Kivest Cipher). Its method of 
authentication is essentially that of Shared Key Authentication since both the access 
point and the wireless device possess the same key. WEP keys are always either 40 bit 
or 104 bit. The advertised 64-bit and 128-bit encryption results from the fact that 
the Initialization Vector (IV) is 24 bits. 
The IV is sent openly in every transmission and changes with every frame to 
assist in providing security. With a 24-bit key there are almost 17 million possible 
values for the IV.Yet with a moderately busy wireless network, that number of IVs is 
reached in only hours and in some cases minutes. This represents a major flaw in 
WEE As IVs are reused, an attacker can employ them to decipher the WEP key. 
WEP has a number of security issues involved with it. The first is that of authen- 
tication. As mentioned earlier in this access point, the four basic requirements for 
authentication in a wireless LAN are 
9 
A robust method providing identity that cannot be spoofed 
9 
A method of preserving the identity of subsequent transactions that cannot 
be transferred 
9 
Mutual authentication 
9 
Authentication keys independent from encryption (and other) keys 
As mentioned in a number of sources, WEP fails on all these points. Its authenti- 
cation key is the same one it uses for encryption. Additionally, no further authentica- 
tion is performed after the initial authentication, meaning that after authentication 
occurs, another device could potentially infiltrate the network; also, the wireless 
device never authenticates the access point itself, leaving the possibility open that a 
rogue access point could spoof the wireless device into sending additional informa- 
tion that could help crack the key.

230 
Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
With the encryption method used by WEE an attacker with enough IVs can 
crack the key used and gain full access to the network. In studies, WEP networks 
have been broken into extremely quickly. Recently, at an information security con- 
ference, the Federal Bureau of Investigation demonstrated how to crack WEP~and 
they did it in three minutes. 
Overall, the use of WEP can create in the casual user a false sense of security. In 
the worst-case scenario, an attacker can gain full access to the network extremely 
quickly~as such, this should not be used to secure a sensitive network. In today's 
access points, WEP is not considered a secured method of securing a wireless access 
point. Be careful of out-of-the-box encryption using WEE 
With all of that said, WEP is better than the default settings. It should not be 
used to secure company information or trade secrets, but for regular home use. It is 
the equivalent of locking your front door when it is made of glass windows. It will 
not keep a focused attacker out, but it is more complicated than just walking in. 
WPA 
WPA resolves the issue of weak WEP headers as explained earlier, or the IVs, and 
provides a way of insuring the integrity of the messages that passed the integrity 
check using TKIP (the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) to enhance data encryp- 
tion. WPA-PSK is a special mode of WPA for home users without an enterprise 
authentication server and provides the same strong encryption protection. In simple 
terms, WPA-PSK is extra-strong encryption where encryption keys are automatically 
changed (called rekeying) and authenticated between devices after a specified period 
of time, or after a specified number of packets has been transmitted. This is called the 
rekey interval. WPA-PSK is far superior to WEP and provides stronger protection 
for the home/SOHO user for two reasons.The process used to generate the encryp- 
tion key is very rigorous, and the rekeying (or key changing) is done very quickly. 
WPA improves over WEP because it uses a per session encryption key. Every 
time a station associates, a new encryption key is generated based on randomization 
and the media access control addresses of the wireless access point. 
Unfortunately, though, the easiest way to use WPA actually makes it easier to 
crack than WEP. When 802.1X authentication is not used in WPA, a simpler system 
called Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is. A pre-shared key is a password that all clients need 
to be configured with in order to access the access point. Most consumer routers 
have the capability of using the WPA with the PSK preshared key. 
With WPA-PSK, and almost all passwords, if you make a short character pass- 
word, then you are susceptible to an offline dictionary attack where an attacker grabs 
a few packets at the time a legitimate station joins the wireless network, and then 

Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 9 Chapter 7 
231 
can take those packets and recover the PSK used. An attacker can get what he needs 
in order to guess the PSK and get out without anyone noticing. This can occur 
because the attacker doesn't have to be near the WLAN for more than a few sec- 
onds, and the LAN doesn't have to be very busy. This attack depends on the choice 
of a password, although cracking techniques get better and better. Thus, WPA has 
been defeated. Most wireless access points have a mechanism built into WPA, which 
converts an 8- to 63-character string you type in to the 64-digit or 128-digit key (as 
used with WEP). Although most wireless access points won't be able to use the 
whole 64-bit key with pass phrase mode. 
The innate problem is that a pass phrase is easy to guess.The IEEE committee 
that wrote 802.11i pointed out that an eight- to ten-character pass phrase actually 
has less than the 40 bits of security that the most basic version of WEP offers, and 
said that a pass phrase of less than about 20 characters is unlikely to deter attacks.As 
with WEE wireless cracking tools exist that are specifically designed to recover the 
PSK from a WPA-protected network (such as Kismet) which are easily available to 
download. 
WPA with 802.1X authentication (sometimes called WPA-Enterprise) makes for 
a much more secure network. 802.1X offers strong positive authentication for both 
the station and the WLAN infrastructure, while deriving a secure, per-session 
encryption key that is not vulnerable to any casual attack. This is typically used with 
a RADIUS server as explained earlier regarding authentication. The best wireless 
security mechanism out there with most access points is 802.1X authentication, 
combined with WPA's improved encryption. 
But instead of" pointing out all of the inherent flaws with passing data over unli- 
censed radio frequencies, WPA, which comes with most new consumer routers, is an 
excellent way to keep your Internet surfing and home network as safe as it can be. 
Add VPN connections and MAC filtering and you basically have the same security 
as you do with an alarm system on your home. It deters people from getting access 
without considerable resolve. 
Intrusion Detection Systems 
Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are monitoring devices on the network that help 
security administrators identify attacks in progress, stop them, and conduct forensic 
analysis after the attack is over. These can either be network-based or software-based 
and can be used with wireless network points to determine if a wireless access point 
is being attacked and perhaps compromised. Intrusion detection tools assist organiza- 
tions by expanding options available to manage the risk from threats and vulnerabili- 
ties. They gather useful information that can not only be used to detect an attacker 
but also to identify and stop him, support investigations as to the attacker's strategy, 
and prevent his strategy from being used in the future.

Chapter 7 9 Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users 
Access Point Spoofing 
Sometimes hackers can imitate an existing access point. By doing this, they change 
the SSID and MAC address to totally imitate a wireless access point already in exis- 
tence. Then, for example, when you unsuspectingly connect, the attacker will be able 
to intercept all confidential information and much more. In order to thwart this 
wireless access point, audits should be done periodically to make sure there aren't 
unsuspected rogue access points. 
Many off-the-shelf access points allow you to see all of the devices connected to 
the network or that have connected to the network in the past. This is how you are 
able to see if an unsuspecting neighbor has accessed your network by accident or on 
purpose. If your network was accessed by a real intruder, more than likely the tracks 
will have been covered. But someone active on their network will tend to see unfa- 
miliar peers through the access point, or on their network. 
Summary 
Over the last few years wireless has become integrated into the computer user's life. 
The technology has allowed us to get out of the home and office, or off the desk, 
and let us seek and send information where and when we want. This is a great leap 
in communications and lifestyle. With all such things, there are risks, however, and 
people who are out to take advantage of the openness of the technology. It is our 
responsibility as those that administer and understand the technology to educate, 
communicate, and support our users despite their lack of interest in understanding 
how it works. 
We could go about preaching policy, firewall rules, and access control lists to 
help limit the connectivity of our users, but this would go against the very reason 
the license was granted to use the radio frequency in the first place. We are here to 
increase the sophistication of our users through patience and communication. At the 
same time, we have an obligation to protect our data systems and promote the use of 
new technologies that make us more mobile and more human. The key is to pay 
attention, to look for bad practices, and take the initiative to improve them. More 
importantly, it is to let users know why we are taking action, and spreading such 
news for the sake of security. It took years for the American people to lock their 
homes and cars; it took massive crime waves and news casts to get people to take 
action to protect their valuables. We should do our best to ensure that we relay these 
same messages in order to secure not only data but the access to bandwidth and pri- 
vate information.

Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Introduction: What 
Is "No-Tech Hacking?" 
When I got into this field, I knew I would have to stay ahead of the tech curve. I 
spent many sleepless nights worming through my home network trying to learn the 
ropes. My practice paid off. After years of hard work and dedicated study, I founded 
a small but elite pen testing team. I was good, my f00 strong. Networks fell prostrate 
before me. My co-workers looked up to me, and I thought I was The Man. Then I 
met Vince. 
In his mid-40s, hawk-eyed, and vaguely European looking, Vince blended in 
with the corporate crowd. His usual attire consisted of a pair of black wing tips, a 
nice dress shirt, a black leather trench coat, and every now and then, he topped it all 
off with a black fedora. He had a definite aura. Tales of his exploits were legendary. 
Some said he had been a fed, working deep-black projects for the government. 
Other insisted he was some kind of mercenary genius, selling his dark secrets to the 
highest bidder. 
Vince was brilliant. In fact, brilliant was an understatement. He held several col- 
lege degrees~or so I heard~but it wasn't his academic knowledge that people 
talked about. He could do interesting and seemingly impossible things. He could 
pick locks, short-circuit electronic systems, and pluck information out of the air with 
fancy electronic gear. He once showed me a system he built called a "van Eck" 
something-or-other. * It could sniff the electromagnetic radiation coming from a 
CP,.T and reassemble it, allowing him to eavesdrop on someone's computer monitor 
from a quarter mile away. He taught me that a black-and-white TV could be used to 
monitor 900MHz cellular phone conversations. I still remember hunching over a 
table in my basement going at the UHF tuner post of an old black-and-white TV 
with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. When I heard a cellular phone conversation 
coming through that old TV's speaker, I decided then and there I would learn every- 
thing I could from Vince. 
I was incredibly intimidated before our first gig. Fortunately, we had different 
roles. I was to perform an internal assessment, which emulated an insider threat. If an 
employee went rogue, he could do unspeakable damage to a network. In order to 
properly emulate this, our clients provided us a workspace, a network jack, and the 
username and password of a legitimate, non-administrative user. I was tasked with 
leveraging those credentials to gain administrative control of critical network sys- 
tems. If I gained access to confidential records stored within a corporate database, for 
example, my efforts were considered successful. I had a near-perfect record with 
internal assessments and was confident in my abilities. 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
235 
Vince was to perform a physical assessment that emulated an external physical 
threat. The facility had top-notch physical security. They had poured a ton of money 
into expensive locks, sensors, and surveillance gear. I knew Vince would obliterate 
them all with his high-tech superpowers. The gig looked to be a real slam-dunk 
with him working the physical and me working the internal. We were the "dream 
team" of security geeks. 
When Vince insisted I help him with the physical part of the assessment, I just 
about fell over. I imagined a James Bond movie, with Vince as "Q" and myself (of 
course) as James Bond in ninja assault gear. Vince would supply the gadgets, like the 
van Eck thingamabob and I would infiltrate the perimeter and spy on their surveil- 
lance monitors or something. I giggled to myself about the unnatural things we 
would do to the electronic keypad systems or the proximity locks. I imagined the 
looks on the guard's faces when we duct-taped them to their chairs after silently rap- 
pelling down from the ceiling of the surveillance room. 
I couldn't wait to get started. I told Vince to hand over the alien gadgets we 
would use to pop the security. When he told me he hadn't brought any gadgets, I 
laughed and poked him. I never knew Vince was a kidder. When he told me he 
really didn't bring any gear, I briefly considered pushing him over, but I had heard 
he was a black belt in like six different martial arts, so I just politely asked him what 
the heck he was thinking. He said we were going to be creative. The mercenary 
genius, the storm center of all the swirling rumors, hadn't brought any gear. I asked 
him how creative a person could be when attacking a highly secured building 
without any gear. He just looked at me and gave me this goofy grin. I'll never forget 
that grin. 
We spent the morning checking out the site. It consisted of several multistory 
buildings and a few employee parking lots, all enclosed by protective fencing. 
Everyone came and went through a front gate. Fortunately, the gate was open and 
unguarded. With Vince driving, we rounded one building and parked behind it, in 
view of the loading docks. 
lnere, he said. 
"Where?" I asked. 
lnere, he repeated. 
Vince's sense of humor sucked sometimes. I could never quite tell when he was 
giving me crap. I followed the finger and saw a loading dock. Just past the bay doors, 
several workers carried packages around. "The loading dock?" I asked. 
"That's your way in." 
I made a "Pffft" sound. 
"Exactly. Easy." he said. 

236 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
"I didn't mean 'Ps 
as in easy. I meant 'Pffft' as in there's people there and you said 
I was going an."" 
"There are, and you are,' he said. Vince was helpful that way. "Just look like you 
belong. Say hello to the employees. Be friendly. Comment on the weather." 
I did, and I did. Then I did, and I did and I found myself inside. I walked around, 
picked up some blueprints of tanks and military-looking stuff, photocopied them 
and left. Just like that. I'm skipping the description of my heart pounding at 400 
beats per minute and the thoughts of what military prison would be like and 
whether or not the rumors about Bubba were true, but I did it. And it was an 
incredible rush. It was social engineering at its simplest, and it worked wonders. No 
one questioned me. I suppose it was just too awkward for them. I couldn't hide my 
grin as I walked to the car. Vince was nowhere to be found. He emerged from the 
building a few minutes later, carrying a small stack of letter-sized paper. 
"How did you get in?" I asked. 
"Same way you did." 
"So why didn't you just do it yourself?." I asked. 
"I had to make sure it would work first." 
I was Vince's guinea pig but it didn't really matter. I was thrilled and ready for 
more. The next building we targeted looked like an absolute fortress. There were no 
loading docks and the only visible entrance was the front door. It was wood and 
steel~too much like a castle door for my taste~and approximately six inches thick, 
sporting a proximity card-reader device. We watched as employees swiped a badge, 
pulled open the doors and walked in. I suggested we tailgate. I was on a roll. Vince 
shook his head. He obviously had other plans. He walked towards the building and 
slowed as we approached the front door. Six feet from the door, he stopped. I walked 
a step past him and turned around, my back to the door. 
"Nice weather," he said, looking past me at the door. 
"Ehrmm, yeah," I managed. 
"Good day for rock climbing." 
I began to turn around to look at the building. I hadn't considered climbing it. 
p~o, he said. 'Don't turn around. Let's chat. 
"Chat?" I asked. "About what?" 
"You see that Bears game last night?" he asked. I had no clue what he was 
talking about or even who the Bears were but he continued. "Man, that was some- 
thing else. The way that team works together, it's almost as if..." Vince stopped in 
mid-sentence as the front door opened.An employee pushed the door open, and 
headed towards the parking lot. "They move as a single unit," he continued. I 
couldn't help myself. I turned around. The door had already closed. 
"Crap," I said. "We could have made it inside." 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
237 
"Yes, a coat hanger." 
Vince said strange stuff sometimes. That was just part of the package. It wasn't 
crazy-person stuff, it was just stuff that most people were too dense to understand. I 
had a pretty good idea I had just witnessed his first crazy-person moment. "Let's go," 
he said. "I need a washcloth. I need to go back to the hotel." I had no idea why he 
needed a washcloth, but I was relieved to hear he was still a safe crazy person. I had 
heard of axe murderers, but never washcloth murderers. 
We passed the ride back to the hotel in silence; Vince seemed lost in his 
thoughts. He pulled up in front of the hotel, parked, and told me to wait for him. 
He emerged a few minutes later with a wire coat hanger and a damp washcloth. He 
tossed them into the back seat. "This should work," he said, sliding into his seat and 
closing the doors. I was afraid to ask. Pulling away from the hotel, he continued. "I 
should be able to get in with these." 
I gave him a look. I can't exactly say what the look was, but I imagine it was 
somewhere between "I've had an unpleasant olfactory encounter" and "There's a 
tarantula on your head." Either way, I was pretty convinced he'd lost his mind or had 
it stolen by aliens. I pretended not to hear him. He continued anyhow. 
"Every building has to have exits," he said. "Federal law dictates that in the case 
of an emergency, exit doors must operate from the inside out without the user 
having any prior knowledge of its operation." I blinked and looked up at the sky 
through the windshield. I wondered if the aliens were coming for me next. 
"Furthermore, the exit must not require the use of any key or special token. Exit 
doors are therefore very easy to get out of." 
"This has something to do with that door we were looking at, doesn't it?" I 
asked. The words surprised me. Vince and I were close to the same operating fre- 
quency. 
He looked at me, and then I knew what my look looked like. I instinctively 
swatted at the tarantula that I could practically feel on my head. "This has everything 
to do with that door," he said, looking out the front window and hanging a left. We 
were headed back to the site. "The front door of that facility," he continued, "is 
formidable. It uses a very heavy-duty magnetic bolting system. My guess is that it 
would resist the impact of a 40-mile-an-hour vehicle. The doors are very thick, 
probably shielded, and the prox system is expensive." 
"But you have a washcloth," I said. I couldn't resist. 
"Exactly. Did you notice the exit mechanism on the door?" 
I hadn't, and bluffing was out of the question. "No," I admitted. 
"You need to notice everything," he said, pausing to glare at me. I nodded and he 
continued. "The exit mechanism is a silver-colored metal bar about waist-high." 
I took my shot. "Oh, right. A push bar."The term sounded technical enough. 

238 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
"No, not a push bar." Access denied. "The bar on that door is touch-sensitive. It 
doesn't operate by pressure; it operates when it senses it has been touched. Very 
handy in a fire." We pulled through the site's gate and parked. Vince unbuckled and 
grabbed the hanger and the washcloth from the back seat. He had untwisted the 
hanger, creating one long straight piece of strong, thin wire. He folded it in half, laid 
the washcloth on one end and folded the end of the hanger around it, then bent the 
whole thing to form a funny 90-degree-angled white washcloth flag. I smartly 
avoided any comment about using it to surrender to the guards. "Let's go," he said. 
We walked to the front door. It was nearly 6:00 P.M. and very few employees 
were around. He walked up to the door, jammed the washcloth end of the hangar 
between the doors at waist height and started twisting the hanger around. I could 
hear the washcloth flopping around on the other side of the door. Within seconds, I 
heard a muffled cla-chunle and Vince pulled the door open and walked inside. I stood 
there gawking at the door as it closed behind him. The door reopened, and Vince 
stuck his head out. "You coming?" 
The customer brief was a thing to behold. After the millions of dollars they had 
spent to secure that building, they learned that the entire system had been defeated 
with a washcloth and a wire coat hanger, all for want of a $50 gap plate for the 
door. The executives were incredulous and demanded proof, which Vince provided 
in the form of a field trip. I never learned what happened as a result of that demon- 
stration, but I will never forget the lesson I learned: the simplest solutions are often 
the most practical. 
Sure we could have messed with the prox system, figured out the magnetic tol- 
erances on the lock or scaled the walls and used our welding torches~just like in 
the movies~to cut a hole in the ceiling, but we didn't have to. This is the essence of 
no-tech hacking. It requires technical knowledge to reap the full benefit of a no- 
tech attack, but technical knowledge is not required to repeat it. Worst of all, despite 
the simplicity, a no-tech attack is perhaps the most deadly and misunderstood. 
Through the years, I've learned to follow Vince's advice. I now notice everything, 
and I try to keep complicated thinking reined in. Now, I'm hardly ever off duty. I 
constantly see new attack vectors, the most dangerous of which can be executed by 
anyone possessing the will to do so.

people. To me, strangers are an interesting puzzle and I reflexively try 
to figure out as much about them as I can. When I pass a businessman 
in an airport, my mind goes into overdrive as I try to sense his seat 
number and social status; make out his medical problems; fathom his 
family situation (or sense his sexual orientation); figure out his finan- 
cial standing; infer his income level; deduce his dietary habits; and 
have a guess at his home address. When I go to a restaurant, I drift in 
and out of conversations around me, siphoning interesting tidbits of 
information. My attention wanders as l analyze my surroundings, 
taking it all in. When I walk through the parking lot of a building, I 
check out the vehicles along the way to determine what goes on 
inside and who the building's residents might be. I do all this stuff not 
because of my undiagnosed attention deficit disorder but because it's 
become a habit as a result of my job. I have personally witnessed the 
power of perception. When faced with tough security challenges, I 
don't charge. I hang back and I watch. A good dose of heightened 
perception levels the playing field every time. 
A Word about Social Engineering Jack Wiles talks quite a bit 
about social engineering in his chapter, so I won't belabor it here. 
Suffice it to say that a good no-tech hacker is also a good social engi- 
neer. As we discuss these techniques, bear in mind that an attacker 
employing good social engineering skills alongside these attacks 
makes for a very worthy adversary.

Physical Security 
I remember my first physical assessment. I imagined myself picking locks and dis- 
abling electronic surveillance systems. I imagined myself as that marine in the movie 
Aliens, frantically noodling with wires in an electronic lock, desperately trying to get 
my team inside to safety. Although I ended up breaking into all sorts of amazing 
places in real life--and eventually did bypass a number of electronic surveillance sys- 
tems~I never had to resort to picking a single lock. Simpler techniques always pre- 
vailed. In this section, I'll share some of what worked best for me.

Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Tailgating 
Tailgating describes the act of gaining unauthorized access to a restricted area by fol- 
lowing closely behind an authorized individual. When I suggested tailgating into the 
fortress, Vince opted for the washcloth trick. His idea was better given the situation, 
but tailgating is still one of the best no-tech methods for gaining access to a facility. 
Through the years, I've noticed signs and placards reminding employees to be on 
the lookout for tailgaters. The fact that "tailgater" has become a common term in 
the business environment testifies that this is a common problem. Still, it works. 
Years ago, I was tasked with a physical assessment against a state government 
facility. The facility was broken into two distinct areas: an open area to accommodate 
the general public and a restricted area for state employees. We were tasked with 
entering the restricted area and gaining access to the closed computer network 
inside. Our initial reconnaissance revealed that the open and restricted buildings 
were interconnected, but an armed guard stood watch over the connecting hallway. 
The restricted building's front door was similarly protected. Swipe card readers~ 
none of which appeared vulnerable to the washcloth trick~protected the side 
doors. Armed guards in marked vehicles patrolled the parking lots. Somewhat dis- 
couraged, we continued monitoring the buildings. Eventually we came upon a 
cluster of smokers huddled outside near a door. I knew immediately we had found 
our way in. We headed to the nearest gas station and I bought a pack of cigarettes 
and a lighter. 
I had come prepared to social engineer my way into the building as a phone 
technician.2 I was wearing cruddy jeans, work boots, and a white T-shirt with a 
phone company logo. I had a phone company employee badge clipped to my collar. 
My bright-yellow toolbox sported phone company logos and the clear top revealed 
a small stack of branded payphone info-strips. The toolbox was filled with phone test 
equipment. A battered hardhat completed the look. 
The official-looking getup was, of course, a complete fabrication. I downloaded 
the phone company logo from the Internet. I printed the T-shirt myself using iron- 
on transfer paper. I printed the badge on my home printer and laminated it with a 
$2 kit. The payphone strips were liberated from some local payphones. The phone 
test gear was legitimate; I had collected it for just such an occasion. I found the 
hardhat abandoned on the side of the road~its battered condition made it more 
convincing. (See Figure 8.1.)

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
241 
Figure 8.1 Paraphernalia of a Phony Phone Technician 
Approaching the group of smokers would have been a bad idea, regardless of 
how good an actor I turned out to be. If they watched me wander towards them 
from the parking lot, they would certainly consider me an outsider. If instead they 
came out of the building and found me already there, halfway through a smoke, they 
might assume I had come out of the building for a break. 
I waited for the smokers to disburse and made my way to the side door. A pair 
of employees eventually came out for a smoke and talked amongst themselves. I 
greeted them casually and joined in their small talk. They chattered about company 
politics and I nodded appropriately, making sure to blow smoke up into the air every 
now and then to convince them of my familiarity with cigarettes. I grunted about 
how the phone system was a pain in the rear-end. They laughed and I tried not to 
gag on the cigarette, wondering the whole time if I was turning as green as I felt. As 
they put out their smokes, they swiped their badges. I flicked my cigarette into the 
road and held the door open for them. They thanked me for the kind gesture and I 
filed in behind them. Once inside I wished them a good day and had my way with 
the facility. 
I made my way through the building and was never challenged. At one point, I 
even walked through the security office. The receptionist looked surprised to see me 
until I pointed to an empty desk and told her the phone was broken. She wasn't sure 
whether the phone was broken or not but she let me in~I was the phone guy after 
www.syngress.com 

242 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
all. I plopped my toolbox on the desk, picked up the phone and heard a dial tone. I 
shook my head, put the phone back on the cradle and lifted my toolbox off the 
desk, taking with it a stack of important looking documents. I left the office grum- 
bling about stupid work orders and how they always give me the wrong jack 
number and how it always made me look like an idiot. The receptionist giggled and 
told me to come back any time. I think she liked me. 
All in all, it was a good day. The facility was simple to gain access to despite the 
expensive safeguards. I left with hardcopy proof of my presence and I had softcopy 
proof of my intrusion into their network thanks to the data on my paperback-sized 
computer. The employees never challenged me because they recognized the logo and 
knew that it belonged to a phone company. If the logo looked legit, the credentials 
looked legit. If the credentials looked legit, I looked legit. But I had purposely played 
the role of a technician from the wrong phone company. The company I selected was 
a recognized data and voice service provider. They did not provide local hardware 
support. In layman's terms, even if I was an employee of that phone company, I had 
no business being in the facility, and even if I did, I wouldn't have been testing 
phone handsets. 
It all boiled down to playing a convincing role. I used the age-old technique of 
tailgating to gain initial access to the building and then threw in a healthy dose of 
social engineering to schmooze those I met inside. Every step of the way an 
employee took me at face value, even though any one of them could have put an 
immediate end to the break-in. 
Bear in mind that the phone technician gag isn't the only one at my disposal. 
Depending on the situation, I could have played the role of a delivery person, an 
electrician, a plumber, an elevator repairman or any other kind of service personnel. 
The choices are endless. All I need to do is be in the right place at the right time, 
present a convincing demeanor, and dress the part. Finding the right place and time 
takes patience. Schmoozing takes practice. Dressing the part simply requires that I get 
a decent photo of the person I'm interested in imitating. At first, I found this diffi- 
cult. I would sneak around trying to get a crisp candid photo to work from, but 
failed miserably. The pictures would end up blurred or off-centered, and in most 
cases I couldn't make out the small details that render the outfit convincing. 
Eventually I learned to follow my own advice and take the simplest approach. Now, 
I just ask for permission to photograph service personnel. I ask in a polite, non- 
threatening way and most workers are more than happy to oblige me. The guy 
shown in Figure 8.2 was extremely accommodating, allowing me to photograph his 
outfit, his truck and even his employee badge.

"~iiiiiiii~i!ii tographed. The security weakness lies in allowing your employees to 
remain non-confrontational when something seems off. Employees 
need to understand that tailgating should never be permitted, and 
service personnel should not be taken at face value. Challenge their 
presence, especially if they are unfamiliar or something seems out of 
place. 
Where Are Your Badges? 
My phone company getup was convincing, but without the badge I doubt I would 
have made it inside. The badge identified me as a phone guy. However, the badge 
was nothing more than a laminated bit of printer paper. To use security jargon, that 
laminated paper was my authentication token. By letting someone visually inspect it, 
they could draw a conclusion about whether or not I was legitimate. This type of 
visual identification is a weak authentication mechanism because it is so easily dupli- 
cated. Unfortunately, many facilities rely on exactly this type of security, yet it 
amazes me how many badges I see worn out in public. 

244 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
I spot at least ten different types of badges a day. If I had a nickel for every time 
I saw a new badge, I'd have a whole lot of nickels. Even though I've seen hundreds or 
thousands of badges in my lifetime, I still get giddy when I see a new one because I 
know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I could somehow use it to gain access to 
that company. Even if they employ some sort of electronic system to validate the 
card--we'll talk more about those systems later in this section~I could probably use 
the badge to tailgate or social engineer my way inside. Getting giddy about site 
badges is admittedly strange, but I've long since given up on the doldrums of nor- 
mality. These days I go all the way; I carry a camera wherever I go to capture badges 
I spot in the wild. I spotted the badge shown in Figure 8.3 in a local mall.

Badges sometimes appear in packs, as the photo in Figure 8.4 reveals.

I captured this next photo (see Figure 8.5) as I sat in a corporate lobby. The walls 
were lined with all sorts of plaques and awards that the company had earned through 
the years. Several fiat-screen monitors droned through PowerPoint presentations 
extolling their corporate virtues. I amused myself with a game of"count the buz- 
zwords" until I saw this particular slide and nearly flipped backwards out of the over- 
stuffed leather armchair.

This slide was one of several that showed groups of employees~in various stages 
of corporate bonding~all wearing their badges. After spending a total of two min- 
utes in the building's open lobby, I had no less than ten badge photos. Fortunately 
for this company, I was "off duty" and never discovered if a laminated bit of printer 
paper would be enough to work my way inside. 
Government agencies have known for years that employee badges should be 
removed when leaving the workplace. The more secretive agencies are very proactive 
when it comes to enforcing this policy. I was not surprised to discover so few open- 
air badges around more secretive government buildings. The keyword here is few. 
While spending some time in the D.C. corridor, I came upon an outdoor barbeque 
catered by an office leasing company. The event was designed to show appreciation 
for the various corporate tenants, some of which were government related. As I 
wandered around the large catering tent, I was amazed at the number of badges I 
spotted. I was so busy snapping pictures of people that I nearly forgot to take advan- 
tage of the free grub. 
Although I saw badges belonging to several different companies, some were 
more surprising than others, like the airfield badge shown in Figure 8.6. 
Figure 8.6 
I am relatively certain that airport security personnel do not rely solely on visual 
badge identification as an authentication mechanism, but the photo is interesting 
nonetheless considering it was taken well away from airport property.

Two women waiting in line caught my eye (not in that way). The taller of the 
two was very important-looking. She was dressed in a smart black suit and was 
having an important-sounding conversation on her Blackberry cell phone. It wasn't 
the geek-chic cell phone that caught my eye, but rather the plethora of badges and 
paraphernalia dangling from her lanyard. Traveling in tech circles, I've seen my share 
of lanyard clutter, but this nice lady took the prize for most neck-flair toted by a 
female. (See Figure 8.7.) 
Figure 8.7

As I drew closer, I realized that her badge was decidedly governmental in 
appearance. I took a few photos~which neither of them seemed to notice~and 
after reviewing them, I realized I had a horrible angle on the more interesting 
badges. As she continued chatting into the phone, I swung around to the other side 
of her and stepped in as close as I could without triggering her (admittedly 
impaired) stalker detection system. Less than a foot away from her, I snapped the 
photo shown in Figure 8.8.

Figure 8.8 
This particular badge is issued to government employees stationed at the 
Pentagon. The Post-It note reminds her to "bring a copy of yesterday's all hands to 
DSS H.Q." Granted, security at the Pentagon is second to none. I know from per- 
sonal experience that the guards stationed at the Pentagon mean business. They are 
not to be trifled with. I also know that visual identification of a badge at the 
Pentagon means absolutely nothing. All badges are electronically verified, and the 
security of that electronic process is world-class. Still, I had no doubt that Pentagon 
security personnel would not take kindly to employees exhibiting this kind of care- 
less behavior. I'm not pointing the finger at the Pentagon, but I need to illustrate an 
important point: even the most die-hard government agencies hire sometimes-care- 
less human beings. The policies in place at the Pentagon ensure that careless behavior 
does not negatively impact the security posture of the facility. Corporate security 
officers should take this lesson to heart. Visual identification of an employee badge is 
not a secure authentication mechanism. Do not allow any avenue for social engi- 
neers. Establish a secure access mechanism and back it up with sound, enforceable 
policy that employees understand and are bound to. Employees should understand 
that security is not someone else's problem. 
Electronic Badge Authentication 
I think I have successfully established that visual badge identification is inherently 
insecure. Electronic verification is a much more secure method of authentication. 
Although electronic systems have security issues as well (see the sidebar) there are 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
249 
some no-tech attacks that are interesting as well. It is not uncommon to see prox- 
imity-type cards in plain view, as shown in the photo in Figure 8.9. 
Figure 8.9 
This pair had executed good common sense and removed their site badges. 
However, their access cards were still in plain view. Although the possibility existed 
for cloning the cards, in the spirit of no-tech I suggest that an adversary can use 
www.syngress.com 

250 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
visual inspection to learn quite a bit about the card's owner. Consider the typical 
Datawatch card shown in Figure 8.10. 
Figure 8.10 
{{i!iiii!>>~:=: 
~:,i':!!~':!{~i! 
The logo on the left-hand side of the photo reveals it was manufactured by HiD 
Corporation (http://www.hidcorp.com).The physical characteristics and lack of 
additional logos on the card suggest it is proximity-based and is not an iClass card. 
This means the card may be prone to duplication. The toll-free number on the card 
belongs to Datawatch Systems. An adversary can call this number, speak to a repre- 
sentative, read off the top row of numbers, and learn not only the address and 
building number the card will work on, but in some cases the suite or room number 
as well. 
Most people would never consider wearing a Post-It note on their forehead 
revealing their work address, but it's surprising how many people wear these elec- 
tronic cards in plain sight which reveal essentially the same information. Access cards 
like these should be removed when leaving a work area. 
Lock Bumping 
Lock picking is a fairly technical exercise. It requires knowledge of lock mechanics 
and internals, and perfecting the technique takes quite a bit of practice. Lock 
bumping, on the other hand, falls firmly into the no-tech hacking category. The 
technique involves the use of bump keys, or 999 keys, which are keys that have 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
251 
been made by cutting a key blank so each cut is made to a maximum depth and 
the tip and shoulder have been filed down by approximately half a millimeter. To a 
trained eye, bump keys have a very distinct look~the cuts are too uniform~as 
shown in Figure 8.11. 
Figure 8.1 1 
Permission Granted by Toool~The Open Organization Of Lockpickers 
The technique works by inserting a bump key into a lock and tapping the key 
while turning the key slightly in the lock. The bottom internal pins in the lock are 
nudged, transferring momentum to the pins sitting above them. As the top pins fly 
upwards, the bottom pins remain down. When the pins separate, the cylinder can be 
turned, and if done correctly, the lock will open. Bypassing a lock with a bump key 
takes much less skill than picking the lock with a traditional lock pick set or elec- 
tronic pick device. This means that just about anyone can compromise a vulnerable 
lock. For more information on prevention and identification of vulnerable locks, see 
the references mentioned in the sidebar, or personally contact a professional lock- 
smith or security provider.

Master Lock Brute Forcing 
As a kid, I remember seeing the cool Master Lock commercial with the lock that 
was secure even after being drilled clean through by a rifle round. For me, and for 
many others, Master Lock became synonymous with security. To this day, I purchase 
Master Locks based on the brand name alone. However, do not buy just based on 
the brand name. Always investigate all the product offerings to make sure you're get- 
ting a product that suits your needs. For example, the Master Lock model 1500D 
combination lock is ubiquitous (see Figure 8.12). 
www.syngress.com 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
253 
Figure 8.12 
However, as Figure 8.13 shows, the packaging clearly reveals that the lock is 
meant for only basic security tasks.

Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Still, I see this exact lock used in high-security applications almost daily, despite 
the fact that a dangerous brute-force attack against it has come to light. 
Brute forcing describes a technique in which every possible solution for a 
problem is checked to see if it is the solution. For example, a hacker could brute 
force a password by trying every combination of possible passwords until one works. 
This technique is relatively slow, even when automated, but if every possible combi- 
nation is tested, it works reliably. Most mechanical combination locks can be brute- 
forced if an adversary has enough time and patience to complete the attack~and 
therein lies the rub. Most adversaries have neither the time nor the patience to brute 
force a combination lock. In the case of the Master Lock, if we assume each of the 
numbers on the dial is active~which is not the case~we are left with 403 or 64,000 
possible combinations. If an attacker tries one combination every five seconds~a 
reasonable speed considering the clearing process and the left-right turnspit could 
take as long as 88 hours, or nearly four days, to work through every combination. At 
this rate, the attacker would fall before the combination did. 
A shortcut was discovered that reduces the number of combinations to 100. At 
five seconds per attempt, it would take an attacker a mere eight minutes to brute 
force one hundred combinations. Since this book is about protecting your own 
assets, I won't go into all the details required to open a lock using this technique, but 
rather I will describe how to arrive at the last number in the combination. If you use 
this technique against your own locks and are able to determine the last number of 
the combination, you may want to have a professional locksmith evaluate your situa- 
tion, or choose a higher-security Master Lock. 
To begin, you will need to apply tension to the shackle of the lock. A simple 
way to do this is to hold the lock in one hand and use a finger to apply upward 
pressure as shown in Figure 8.14. The stylish thumb ring is optional for this exercise. 
Next, begin turning the dial. If enough tension is applied, the dial should stick 
between two numbers. This is called a sticking point; 12 sticking points exist on each 
affected lock. The first goal is to keep a record of the location of each sticking point. 
For example, the lower boundary of this lock's first sticking point is one. (See Figure 
8.15.) 
www.syngress.com 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
255 
Figure 8.14 
Figure 8.15 
The high boundary of this same sticking point is the number two as shown in 
Figure 8.16. 
www.syngress.com 

256 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.1 6 
The location of the first sticking point rests between these numbers at 1.5, 
which is obviously not a whole number. To find the next sticking point, release the 
tension on the shackle, turn the dial past the current sticking point's high boundary 
and reapply tension. The dial should stick again, revealing the location of the next 
sticking point. Some sticking points will rest on whole numbers. For example, the 
low boundary of this sticking point is 7.5. (See Figure 8.17.) 
Figure 8.1 7 
www.syngress.com 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
257 
The high boundary of this same sticking point is 8.5 as shown in Figure 8.18. 
Figure 8.18 
This means that the sticking point rests on eight. Keep a record of each sticking 
point. Table 8.1 shows the sticking points of my test lock.

Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Notice that more than half of the sticking points do not land on whole num- 
bers. These are decoys and should be removed from the list of potential combination 
digits. In our example, we are left with five numbers: 8, 15, 18, 28, and 38. Notice 
that each of these numbers end in the same digit~the number eight. These 
matching numbers should be removed from the list as well, leaving only one 
number, 15, which is the last digit of my lock's combination. 
If this technique works on your lock, there's a good chance the lock is vulner- 
able to a brute-force attack. If the technique does not work, you may have a newqr 
1500D Master Lock. It is speculated (on www.wikihow.com/Crack-a-Master- 
Combination-Lock) that 1500D Master Locks with serial numbers beginning with 
the number 800 are not vulnerable to this attack, although unverified sources have 
reported success against these newer locks as well. Either way, don't be quick to 
throw stones at Master Lock. Do your research, and don't purchase basic security 
products for high-security tasks. Consider purchasing a higher security Master 
Lock for your application, or get the advice of a professional locksmith or security 
professional.

Picking Locks with Toilet Paper? 
In 1992, the BBC reported that certain cylindrical axial pin tumbler locks were vul- 
nerable to bypass by unskilled thieves. Twelve years later, in August of 2004, Marc 
Tobias, author of Locks, Safes, and Security, found that Kensington and Targus were 
using similar cylindrical axial designs in their laptop lock products. His report sug- 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
259 
gested that the locks could be easily bypassed with a pen or a toilet paper tube. In 
September of 2004, Chris Brennan described on his forums (www.bikeforums.net) 
how an expensive Kryptonite bike lock (which used the same cylindrical axial 
design) could be bypassed with a Bic pen. Chris posted videos to 
www.bikeforums.net/video and a media frenzy ensued. 
Enter Barry Wels of Toool. While presenting at a hacker conference, Barry cre- 
ated a video (http://www.toool.nl/kensington623.wmv) showing how to apply the 
bypass technique to a specific Kensington laptop lock system. The hacker commu- 
nity found the video interesting, but the public in general was awed by the fact that 
he accomplished the bypass in mere moments using the cardboard from a toilet 
paper roll. (See Figure 8.19.) 
Figure 8.1 9 
While there is always speculation about who thought of what first, nearly one 
million people have downloaded the video from Barry's site, and countless others 
have downloaded it from sites like Youtube.com. ! love Barry's video because it is so 
accessible and it clearly demonstrates what I'm trying to show in this chapter: even 
the most complex security systems are at risk from simple attacks. If you have sensi- 
tive data on a laptop, and you rely on a single locking device to protect that data, 
you'll probably get burned whether or not the lock is vulnerable to this attack. 
Whenever you rely on a single layer of security, odds are you'll get burned. A laptop 
lock isn't a bad idea, but if you're concerned about losing sensitive data on the

machine, consider some sort of crypto solution as well. Above all, try to think like a 
hacker. In that frame of mind, is a spindly cable the best solution? 
Electric Flossers" A Low-Tech Classic 
Lock picking is a real skill. To do it right, you've got to have a working knowledge 
of how locks operate and you need to practice. With the advent of newer devices, 
lock picking seems more accessible than ever. Still, lock-picking guns and electric 
devices are not foolproof. They require a decent amount of skill to successfully 
operate. In addition, these electric devices are expensive. Most amateurs would not 
consider investing a small fortune in a specialized device that's not foolproof. 
I can just imagine the look on some hacker's face when he or she strolled down 
the dental care aisle in the local Wal-Mart and spied this new-fangled electronic 
flossing device. (See Figure 8.20.) 
Figure 8.20 
I'm not sure who came up with the idea of hacking this innocent-looking thing, 
but someone did. The result was a tiny, inexpensive electric lock-picking system. 
According to Jared Bouck over at Inventgeek.com, this little device, when combined 
with even a makeshift tension wrench, will open most padlocks in a matter of sec- 
onds. (See Figure 8.21.)

Information Security 
A physical vulnerability can certainly put your information at risk, but there are 
quite a few no-tech hacks that can place your information at risk directly. In this 
section, I'll share a few of the more popular no-tech hacks I've relied on over the 
years. 
Shoulder Surfing 
Shoulder suing is a classic no-tech attack in which an adversary peers over the shoulder 
of a victim with the intention of gleaning sensitive information like usernames or pass- 
words. Although the technique has been around since the invention of the computer 
itself, the attack is still amazingly effective thanks to the proliferation of portable com- 
puters and wireless public access points. (See Figure 8.22.) 

262 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.22 
Although I will primarily focus on information that can be gleaned from simply 
looking at the screen, I have come to realize that a great deal of information can be 
determined by looking at the machine itself. (See Figure 8.23.) 
Figure 8.23 
iii~iiiiiiiiiiiiii:ii..:~ 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8

The business card attached to this machine not only highlights the name of the 
company this gentleman works for but also his name, job title, address, home phone, 
and cell phone numbers. As an adversary, I could perform my initial reconnaissance 
on him without even glancing at his screen. In many cases, I see property stickers, 
property passes, barcodes, and even stencil paintings on machines. An adversary can 
use this information to profile and perhaps even target an individual. 
Some individuals, like members of the military, are extremely conspicuous when 
seen in public. I don't need to see a business card to realize that the gentleman in 
Figure 8.24 is a member of the United States military. 
Figure 8.24 
It's not hard to tell that he is a fan of Apple products. The Mac Addict magazine, 
the Mac laptop, and the iPod headphones all confirm this. If I were to start a conver- 
sation with him in order to glean sensitive information, I could use his love (and my 
knowledge) of Macs to naturally engage him. In this situation though, social engi- 
neering was not necessary. With the headphones on and his back turned, he was 
oblivious to my approach. I was able to take several pictures of him as he worked 
and I eventually approached to within inches of him. I snapped the photo in Figure 
8.25 that revealed in stark detail not only the dermatologic properties of his neck 
but also his laptop screen. 

264 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.25 
As it turned out, he was not casually surfing the Web, but was logging into the 
administrative console of a BEA WebLogic server. I watched as he typed in his cre- 
dentials, made a quick adjustment to my camera and took another photo. The flash 
fired as I had instructed it to, and he turned around sharply, finally noticing me. I 
quickly pointed the camera towards myself and rubbed my eyes. He shrugged and 
returned to his work, convinced, I assume, that I was some kind of digital camera 
newbie just figuring out the ropes. This is common behavior. Most users of portable 
computers have grown accustomed to blocking out the world around them. This 
makes the .job of an adversary even easier. 
However, there's a bit more to shoulder surfing than simply reading a login page. 
Often, an adversary can piece together a startling amount of information from what 
seems like very little. Take, for example, the photo in Figure 8.26 of a temporarily 
unattended laptop I spotted in a coffee shop. 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
265 
Figure 8.26 
I have altered the image to keep the owner's company name confidential, but by 
using the information on the screen, an accomplished no-tech hacker can glean an 
awful lot of information. For starters, the desktop background indicates that the 
laptop is running Windows XP Professional. Other aesthetic clues such as the Start 
button configuration back this up. The operating system of a machine is a necessary 
piece of information a technical attacker can use to determine the type of attack to 
launch. Generally, an attacker would need to analyze a series of network packet 
responses to determine this information, but in this case that is probably unneces- 
sary; it is unlikely the laptop's owner has installed another operating system's desktop 
background. Although they are a bit blurry since they were captured in the field, the 
desktop icons reveal more information. (See Figure 8.27.)

This is obviously some sort of sales software, but a Google search reveals that 
SalesLogix is the leader in mid-market CR.M (customer relationship management) 
software. The search goes on to say that SalesLogix is "the most powerful sales tool 
on the Web." Another pair of icons (shown in Figure 8.28) refers to SAP, a common 
business software solution provider. 
Figure 8.28 
www.syngress.com 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
267 
The existence of the SAP logon client indicates the logon credentials for the ser- 
vice may be installed on the laptop as well. Another similarly interesting icon reads 
SecuRemote. (See Figure 8.29.) 
Figure 8.29 
A Google search reveals that SecuRemote is a virtual private network (VPN) 
client. As with the SAP logon software, all or part of the VPN credentials may reside 
on the laptop. This could grant an adversary access to services inside the corporate 
network. At the very least, the mere existence of a particular brand of VPN is valu- 
able information to a technical attacker. 
Two more icons on the desktop reveal that Palm personal digital assistant (PDA) 
software has been installed on the machine. (See Figure 8.30.) The existence of this 
software on the laptop suggests the owner is most likely in possession of a Palm PDA 
device.

268 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.30 
These icons also suggest that the Palm device is backed up onto the machine. If 
an adversary gains access to the laptop, they may also gain access to the data stored 
on the Palm. Another icon (shown in Figure 8.31) reveals the existence of the 
AT&T Global Network Client.

The icons provide a great deal of information, but a technically savvy attacker 
can learn even more by looking at other details on the screen. For example, what 
information can you determine by looking at the taskbar shown in Figure 8.32? 
Figure 8.32 
The taskbar itself reveals that the operating system of the machine is a modern 
version of Windows. The battery indicator shows this machine is most likely a 
laptop, and that there are 58 minutes of battery power remaining. We can tell that 
the system is currently unplugged from a power source because there is no electrical 
plug icon next to the battery. The icons reveal a great deal of information about the 
system as well. Starting from the left, the first icon is for Trillian, an instant messaging 
aggregator. The color and style of the icon reveal that the application is currently 
connected. The next icon shows the machine is connected to a wireless access point. 
The ever-popular AIM (AOL Instant Messaging) icon is next, and the style indicates 
it is also connected to a server and that the user is logged in. The battery icon is self- 
explanatory. The MSN instant messenger icon is next. It shows the service is discon- 
nected and thus the user is not logged in. The speakers are muted, as revealed by the 
next icon. The white rectangular icon belongs to the IBM Hard Drive Active 
Protection icon, which indicates that an IBM hard drive is installed in the machine 
and that no shocks have been detected. The last icon, the Microsoft Security Center, 
is an indicator that the operating system of the machine is Windows XP or later. 
Last but not least, the system clock is set to 3:08 P.M. This information can be corre-

270 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
lated with the current local time to help determine the time zone the owner origi- 
nated in. 
This is a great deal of technical information, but it also reveals quite a bit about 
the owner. We know, for example, that he or she is a heavy instant messenger user, as 
evidenced by the number of clients installed. It also appears, at first glance, that the 
user is non-technical since the running applications are simple in nature~other than 
the IBM software, which may have been installed by default. 
A busier task bar reveals even more. What can you tell from looking at the 
expanded version of the taskbar in Figure 8.32? What judgments can you make 
about the user based on the taskbar revealed in Figure 8.33? 
Figure 8.33 
Many of the icons look the same, but some are different, and they change the 
profile of the user slightly, uncovering more specific information about the machine 
being used. The icon to the left of the battery indicates the laptop has an Intel 
Pro/Wireless 2200BG wireless network adapter. The icon to the right of the battery 
icon indicates that Norton Anti-Virus is running and that auto-protect has been 
enabled to protect against virus threats. The next icon, the one that looks like a 
green onion, would raise a technical user's eyebrows and would make the owner of 
the laptop a very interesting target. The onion is an icon for Vidalia, a package that 
incorporates Tor (The Onion router) and privoxy, two tools used to anonymize a 
user's Internet activity. A user surfing the Web with Tor enabled surfs in complete 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
271 
and utter anonymity. Remote Web sites can't tell where they are coming from, and 
anyone sniffing the local network traffic can't see where they are going. The blue 
envelope icon belongs to the IBM Message Center, which confirms that the laptop 
was most likely manufactured by IBM. The last icon on the right belongs to the 
Windows Tablet and Pen Settings Control Panel item. This reveals that the machine 
is a tablet PC. 
Again, this information is very interesting to a technical attacker, but when 
pulled together it can be used to paint a very clear picture of what type of informa- 
tion the machine might contain and the technical ability of the machine's owner. 
So what can you do? The best defense is to remain aware when traveling. Don't 
put yourself in situations that invite shoulder surfers. Position your back to the wall 
when using your machine, and never leave your machine unattended. Don't wear 
company logos and remove extraneous markings and information from your mobile 
computing devices, especially if your company name might entice an adversary. The 
tech support folks in your organization can probably provide you a long list of tech 
things to avoid when traveling. Follow their advice. 
Dumpster Diving 
Another favorite hacker sport, dumpster diving describes the act of slogging through 
the trash in search of valuable tidbits of information. This might sound messy, but it 
doesn't have to be. Many times, interesting stuff is just hanging out there, waiting to 
be grabbed, as shown in Figure 8.34.

I've found similar documents~such as the one in Figure 8.36 revealing propri- 
etary information~lying outside of dumpsters. 
Figure 8.36 
Admittedly, I've only seen a handful of cases that were this blatant. More often, I 
have to actually stick my head into the dumpster and peer inside. I discovered the 
document in Figure 8.37 in a dumpster on top of an open box of similar papers. It 
contains client, sales, and account information along with the Social Security num- 
bers of the sales staff that received incentive payments on a particular contract. 
Although this dumpster first appeared empty, the white envelopes littering the 
bottom of the container caught my eye. This particular health care invoice (See 
Figure 8.38) appears to have been opened and discarded, as if the recipient were fin- 
ished with it. If this were my healthcare invoice, I would have certainly shredded it, 
or at least put it in the cat litter bag to deter even the most dedicated snoop.

The invoice in Figure 8.39, addressed to someone else, was discarded even before 
it was opened.

Further examination of the dumpster revealed other similar unopened envelopes. 
Examination of the address information on other envelopes in the dumpster revealed 
that these invoices were not discarded by the patient, but rather by the health care 
provider. In this case, it appears the patients had no control over how their confiden- 
tial health information was handled. Obviously, this particular health care provider 
thought HIPAA had something to do with large thick-skinned semi-aquatic African 
mammals. 
So what's the solution? It's to keep an eye on your trash. If I can grab all this 
without so much as touching a single piece of refuse, you should be able to get a 
feel for things by glancing at your dumpster every now and again. Signs like that in 
Figure 8.40 are a nice idea and serve as a great reminder.

The bottom line is that you should know what's in your trash before the bad 
guys do. If you find stuff in your trash that doesn't belong, you have a policy 
problem, or more likely an enforcement problem. If you deal with sensitive data (and 
who doesn't, really) it's in your best interest to keep a tight reign on what ends up in 
that big green box outside. 
Watching TV, Hacker Style 
So far, we've seen some interesting low-tech hacking techniques, but each of them 
requires some work. Shoulder surfing and dumpster diving takes a bit of walking, 
and God forbid, sometimes a bit of lifting. I know some of you (particularly the ones 
sitting on the couch, about ready to put this book down and grab for the remote) 
are thinking there must be something easier. Well, this section is for you. It's possible 
to be a full-fledged no-tech hacker from the comfort of a couch. In fact, this tech- 
nique requires that you actually chill out for a while, put your feet up, and watch TV. 
You heard me right. The catch is that you have to be at a hotel, preferably a nice 
one. Isn't it amazing the tortuous lengths a dedicated hacker will go to? 
After years of playing road warrior as I bounced from gig to gig, the hotel room 
became my home away from home. I never had cable TV as an adult, so flipping 
through the channels was a nice treat. Eventually, the thrill wore off and I found 
myself wanting something more. I knew better than to travel down the road of the 
$13-an-hour adult channels (don't get hooked, it'll wreck your life) but the tech- 
nology behind the hotel TV system intrigued me. I began by fiddling with the TV 
controls, trying to access anything other than channel 3. I used the channel control 
buttons on the front of the TV as well as the remote, but the result was always the 
same: the TV had been locked down, allowing access to only seven or eight chan- 
nels, which were odd channels showing nothing but static. Playing with the pay-per- 
view buttons on the remote got me nowhere. Everything I did gave me the distinct 
feeling I was pounding on the front gate of the castle. The system had been designed 
to deter this kind of fiddling. 
I tossed aside the remote and pulled out the TV to check the rear connections. I 
found a standard coax cable coming from the wall, connecting to a funny box on 
the back of the TV. Another coax cable ran from the box to the back of the TV. My 
first thought was to unplug all the cables and bypass the magic box. Closer inspec- 
tion revealed something I didn't expect. (See Figure 8.42.) 
www.syngress.com 

278 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.42 
Hard plastic sleeves secured the cable ends. Removing the cables required a spe- 
cial tool that slipped inside the sleeve and allowed access to the cable's collar.After 
considering the problem for a few moments, I rummaged through my bag and 
found my car keys. I jammed my ignition key down inside one of the protective col- 
lars and cranked it counter-clockwise. The cable turned inside the collar. I kept at it, 
and the cable rotated with each turn of the key. After several full rotations, the cable 
was a twisted mess, but eventually it came free and untangled, flailing around like an 
injured snake. I unscrewed each of the remaining cables and connected one of them 
from the wall directly into the back of the TV. I grabbed the remote and began flip- 
ping through the few channels the TV allowed. Each of them came in clearly; the 
static I had seen previously was gone. This was a sign that the hotel's raw cable feed 
was displaying cleanly through the TV's tuner, exactly as I had hoped. It was an 
interesting find, but not nearly as interesting as what I found on channel 75. (See 
Figure 8.43.)

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
279 
Figure 8.43 
As I read the information on the screen, the geek in me was delighted to see an 
IP address (10.1.1.11), a port number (7500), a pathname to a Windows or DOS 
executable (c:\metil\software\mtiltree.exe), and a universal naming convention 
(UNC) link to a machine share (\\SEACHANGE_TRlg~_drive$). I plopped down 
on the bed and gawked at the screen. My mind spun with the possibilities. Servers 
were running on the hotel's cable system, each connected by an IP network. The 
hacker in me wanted to jump in and start port scanning or sniffing, or something, but 
it was late, and I hadn't exactly been authorized to poke about the hotel's network. I 
snapped a few photos and reassembled the TV and the black box, silently cursing the 
TV for not allowing me access to more channels. There was interesting stuff on the 
blocked TV channels, I was sure of that. 
When I returned from my gig, I couldn't get the hotel network out of my mind. 
I fruitlessly searched the Internet for a way to unlock the channels on the TV3and 
had just about given up on the prospect when I came upon an interesting device in 
a thrift shop. (See Figure 8.44.) 
www.syngress.com 

280 
Chapter 8 9 No-Tech Hacking 
Figure 8.44 
The device was an ancient cable box~a tuner, basically~that connected 
between a cable feed and a television. I paid less than three dollars for it, and 
brought it along on my next gig. 
The moment I walked into my hotel room, I removed the cables from the back 
of the TV (making short work of the annoying sleeves) and connected my cable box 
between the cable feed and the TV. I turned on the TV, set it to channel 3, and 
began flipping through channels on the cable box. Just as I had suspected, I could 
view all the standard cable channels. However, as the numbers climbed I hit more of 
the interesting Seachange channels. Then, suddenly, I found one channel that wasn't 
like the others. (See Figure 8.45.) 
I had to read the information on the screen several times before I realized I was 
looking at someone else's room bill.The screen flashed briefly and the next page dis- 
played. I watched as Mr. Green flipped through his account information. Thanks to a 
$3 device, I was snooping on the hotel's customers. This technique works because 
certain channels are unlocked and distributed on an as-needed basis. If I were to use 
my remote to view my room bill, a channel would be allocated and unlocked, and 
the requested information would be shown on my TV. The cable box gave me the 
ability to see every channel, including the channels currently allocated to other cus- 
tomers. If a customer activated a custom feature on the TV, I could see what was 
happening if I viewed the same channel. Of course, the majority of customers used 
the system to view on-demand movies. If a customer paid for a movie, I could tune

Some hotels have adopted more robust systems that allow customers to use the 
in-room TV as an Internet terminal. A wireless keyboard often accompanies this type of 
system. (See Figure 8.47.)

Adam Laurie, a.k.a, Major Malfunction, has discovered that hotel cable systems 
can be even further abused. By toying around with a PC-controlled IR (infrared) 
device, Adam found that he could reprogram the hotel television directly to allow 
him access to all the restricted channels, without a special tuner. Not only was he 
able to view channels already in use, he could change the ID embedded in his tele- 
vision to appear to be another hotel patron. After changing the code, he found it was 
possible to review their room charges, order items like room service, change the 
status of the room, learn who was staying in the room and for how long, and more. 
Adam even discovered he could take control of the administrative systems like these 
through the use of the in-room wireless keyboard. (See Figure 8.51.) 

No-Tech Hacking 9 Chapter 8 
285 
Figure 8.51 
This functionality was made possible by the black box I disconnected to hook 
up my tuner. For more information about Adam's work, see his presentation at 
www. alc ryp to. c o. uk/MM I rDA/mmirda_sys c an05. pdf. 
Keep these vulnerabilities in mind as you travel, and encourage your employees 
to do the same. Hotel TV-based Internet systems are never considered safe for any 
purpose, and your personal information may be at risk if an adversary is staying in 
the same hotel. And remember, those $13 charges for in-room entertainment that are 
so anonymous. Anyone in the hotel can see them, and how many $13 in-room 
entertainment possibilities are there, exactly?

Summary 
Hackers are certainly a technical bunch, but in this day and age, it pays to think 
simply. No-tech attacks are simple to pull off, but the effects can be devastating to 
your facility's security posture. Learning to think like a hacker is not necessarily as 
difficult as it may seem. Pay attention to the little things, and keep a vigilant watch 
for opportunities you are offering the no-tech hacker. 
Notes

2. Of course, the phone company I emulated had no part in this. I have no affiliation 
with them, and this attack in no way reflects a security problem with that particular 
phone company. Neither my company nor I endorses this kind of behavior except in 
conjunction with an authorized security test. And please don't full-body tackle every 
poor phone technician you spot in the hallway.

Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
Introduction 
For the past 10 years, I've spent a lot of time doing penetration tests. Originally, I 
was working solely from a technical perspective. We did the normal stuff back then, 
poke around a bit, run some scanners, find vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, 
exploit holes, and own the network. In the beginning, it was never all that formatted 
or organized. 
But working for the Department of Defense has its perks, and one of those was 
the continued need to mature the processes we used and create a truly effective and 
repeatable method. Throughout that time in my career, I learned how to document 
all those little thought processes that "go on" within the head of most hackers. But 
documenting was never enough, as I would soon learn. 
In 2000, I took a course offered by the National Security Agency (NSA) called 
the INFOSEC Assessment Methodology, or IAM for short. Being the technical guy 
I was, I about died in that class. The reason was simple: the course focused on orga- 
.nizational aspects of information security that needed to be in place before all the 
technical vulnerabilities would stop running rampant through the organization. 
In this chapter, we'll address the basic attributes that are common in all successful 
penetration testers. We're not going to cover the specific tools or include a ton of 
screenshots. Dozens of books already have that covered. Our goal is to identify those 
useful attributes so you can better address your own methodologies, as well as deter- 
mine your weaknesses and areas for improvement. 
Know the Security Analysis Life Cycle 
Back in the days when we first started doing this type of work, it was all technical. 
That's all we did. We were the geeks, the freaks behind the keyboard; the ones that 
could work around the system controls. What we did seemed normal enough to us, 
but to the uninitiated, it was something akin to black magic or voodoo. 
What I didn't realize at the time was that there are things that have to occur 
along all levels of the security life cycle in order for a penetration test to have the 
greatest value to the customer. The most basic of which is the fact that pen testing is 
just a piece of the overall security life cycle that must be addressed. As with most life 
cycles, things need to occur in their proper order (at least the large majority of the 
time); otherwise, the results could be meaningless or have significantly less value. 
The standard security life cycle looks something like this: An organizational/pro- 
grammatic assessment occurs; a full comprehensive technical evaluation is rendered; 
findings are presented to the customer; the customer takes appropriate the steps to 
close technical problems and implement defenses; and then a test of those defenses 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
291 
takes place. This is where the penetration comes into play. If we put this process into 
a flow chart or image, it would look like Figure 9.1. 
Figure 9.1 The Basic Security Analysis Life Cycle 
t 
l 
www.syngress.com 

292 
Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
The truth of the matter is that this flow of activities and information is most 
advantageous to the customer. In other words, they can expect the absolute best pos- 
sible results from a process similar to this one. Let's examine why that is. 
Programmatic Testing 
As a security professional, you understand that technical vulnerabilities can be found 
and fixed. But you also know that an organization that has not fixed the root cause 
of the issue will continue to have technical problems later on down the road. The 
findings may be different (in some cases they're the same, just on different systems), 
but technical vulnerabilities will continue to rear their ugly heads. 
The root cause of those vulnerabilities is undefined, immature, or undocumented 
processes for areas of control within the organization. For example, a good deal of 
the vulnerabilities we find in technical evaluations or pen tests can be directly 
attributed to a lack of proper patching of applications and operating systems. Sure, 
we can find all the current technical issues and help the customer remedy those, but 
if the organization fails to address the actual patch process within the organization, 
they're going to continue having these findings in the future. The organizational, or 
programmatic, assessment locates these areas of procedural weakness in the organiza- 
tion and allows them to fix those issues. Once proper controls are in place, the 
number of findings in that area will lessen over time. The process is a bit more com- 
plex than the paragraph I've devoted to it here, but for more information, I recom- 
mend you check out Security Assessment: Case Studies for Implementing the NSA IAM 
(Syngress Publishing, 2004). 
..... ~i{{iiiiii{{iii{i{!V~ Its important to understand the entire security life cycle, even if you 
'~i~i!iiiiiiiiiiii !~ only work in a single area. By understanding how your area of exper- 
::i!!i~i!i!E!i!iii!i~ii!i!i!i!Zi 
tise relates to the other areas in the life cycle, you'll be better pre- 
pared to answer customer questions, create useful output from your 
processes, and mature in your own professional experiences. 
Technical Testing 
But we all know that organizational findings aren't all there is when examining a 
customer. The technical piece is extremely important. A comprehensive technical 
evaluation will provide the customer with a clear picture of where those vulnerabili- 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
293 
ties lie and what the potential impact could be on their organization if those systems 
are compromised. The goal here is to allow the organization to understand what 
technical vulnerabilities currently exist, so they can close those while they're still 
working on creating a mature organizational security program. 
Customer Responsibilities 
Now that we've done the work, we want to provide the customer with a final report 
that details our findings, clearly and precisely. A poorly written report, or one that 
doesn't communicate with the intended managerial or executive audience, will 
seldom be of much use. But once the customer has received your well written 
report, they have to step up to the plate and roll up their sleeves. 
This is where the rubber really meets the road, from a customer perspective. For 
each finding we've detailed, they need to implement a fix: a defense or mitigation. 
Think along the lines of fortifying a castle with a variety of defenses that will help 
stop an invading army. They'll implement moats, drawbridges, and towers. They'll 
employ guards, archers, and watchmen. Iron bars will be integrated into the 
stonework around all the sewer and water avenues in and out of the area. This 
analogy explains, basically, what the customer should be working on, based on your 
final report. 
Penetration Testing 
Finally, we're at the fun part (and the focus of this chapter), the penetration test. 
Once the customer has a full understanding of their security posture, both organiza- 
tionally and technically, and they've had the opportunity to defend against their 
weaknesses, they'll need someone to test their defenses. This is similar to the televi- 
sion show where families hire a former burglar to try and break into their homes 
and prove whether it's possible or not. The thief doesn't need to find every way into 
the home, only one. Proving he/she can get into the home is the goal of the show, 
and that's also the goal of a penetration test. 
Optimally, this life cycle will repeat itself every year or two. The shorter the time 
lapse from one life cycle to the next, the more secure and mature an organization 
has the opportunity to be. If the time between one full life cycle to the next is too 
long, the organization is likely to slip back into old habits and insecurity. 
Know When to Deviate 
This might sound a bit counterintuitive initially, but first I'm going to show you 
why you shouldn't normally deviate from the security analysis life cycle before I tell 
www.syngress.com 

294 
Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
you why you should. As with all good rules, there are exceptions and we'll point 
those out here. But let's first look at why you shouldn't. 
Stick to the Life Cycle 
Going back to our castle analogy, let's suppose that the owner of the castle comes to 
you one day and says, "Reader, I'd like you to perform a penetration test on my 
castle and see if you can get in. My dear friend, the Baron of Castle Malarky, has 
recently used similar services and found them to be quite entertaining and useful." 
Okay, stop. Let's look at this request. It sounds like fun, doesn't it, the chance to try 
to break in to a castle? But let's get more information first. 
You ask the owner of this castle whether he has done any work to put up 
defenses or protect his home. He answers with a resounding "No." Don't laugh! You 
know this happens all the time, don't you? The situation is a bit clearer now, isn't it? 
So what do you do? 
Breaking into a castle with no defenses sounds like a really dumb idea. First off, 
it's not likely to be very challenging at all. Secondly, what is the owner actually 
going to walk away with once the work is through? What will you tell him that he 
doesn't already know? "Sir, you have no defenses in place and it was quite easy to get 
in through the front door." And remember, he's paying for this. 
Ethically speaking, if you're a security professional you have certain obligations 
in situations such as these. It reinforces your good reputation if you explain the secu- 
rity analysis life cycle to the customer. They need to understand that the penetration 
test is the final step in security analysis, not the first. If they've done no work at all 
to secure the organization, then it's quite likely to be an easy paycheck for you and 
not very informational to the customer. The goal of a penetration test is to break in, 
not find all the problems that may lurk within the organizational and technical 
structures of the company. 
Break Out of the Life Cycle 
With all that said, let's look at an example of why it may make some sense to deviate 
from the norm. In the past six years alone, I've run into two organizations that had a 
legitimate reason to step outside the normal running of the security analysis life 
cycle and go directly to the penetration test. Both organizations had similar reasons 
for the deviations. 
Remember when the big "DotCom" boom hit and then tanked just a few years 
later? During that time, companies built up huge infrastructures, teaming with 
workers delivering ideas and products to the market with astounding speed. But the 
bubble burst, leaving those companies bloated and unable to react. Due to these cir- 
www.syngress.com 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
295 
cumstances, companies were forced to cut back dramatically. Organizations and 
work forces were scaled down to give the companies a fighting chance in the now 
brutally competitive markets. One side effect of these cuts was the reduction of 
security budgets. 
Executives think in dollars, revenue; it's what they get paid to do. Initially, secu- 
rity professionals were unable to prove a return on investment for all those dollars spent 
on securing the organization. If you can't prove P,.OI, you tend to get cut. At the 
time, very few organizations were comparing information security expenditures to 
the costs of an insurance policy. 
The organizations I dealt with, in particular, needed a penetration test in order 
to take those security vulnerabilities and prove to their executive boards that the 
security budget needed to be bolstered, or the organization was headed toward dis- 
aster. In both cases, the board relented that there were obvious concerns that were 
not being addressed because the security departments had been laid off, en masse, or 
the security budget had been severed. 
This is just an example, but keep it locked away in the back of your mind.You 
may not run into a case exactly like this one, but there's a good chance you'll 
encounter a situation that requires you to think outside the box. Besides, that's what 
hackers do; think outside the box. 
The Penetration Tester Mentality 
The most important tool in any penetration tester's toolkit (more important than 
any application, script, or exploit) is his/her mind. Good pen testers have an uncanny 
ability to locate issues on-the-fly. And since every customer and situation is different, 
this is a "must have" attribute. Let's look at some of those attributes that make up a 
good penetration tester. 
Know the Core Processes 
There are certain things that every penetration tester does, with every client. We'll 
cover them in more detail in the next section, but as a quick prelude; we look at 
what information we can get publicly, we find out what components and services 
exist on the network, we locate all the known vulnerabilities, we break in to a target 
system, we escalate our privileges, we expand our reach, and we ensure our ability to 
get back into those systems later by installing backdoor applications. 
It seems silly to think that hackers are that organized, but we are. We might not 
document all of these processes, but they are the basics used nearly every time. 
Understanding the methodology used provides a reliable structure for the successful

penetration of customer systems. If you roll in to a customer site and just "wing it" 
things aren't likely to turn out so well. I've had dozens of customers call up con- 
cerned about a "prior engagement" with a security firm that lacked processes and 
had poor results. 
N ~Nt,'I~:::!~!~

~ii{~{il! !!'~ Never underestimate the importance of following a standardized and 
u 
mature process. Mature and repeatable processes allow for someone 
%ii17 ~II'I else to step into your shoes if you get hurt or are unable to complete 
your work. 
Think for Yourself 
Whereas core processes provide a foundation that can be taught to nearly everyone, 
creativity is the hallmark of all great penetration testers and is a much less tangible 
trait. Teaching people to think like a hacker is much more difficult; thus, this trait is 
normally what separates the wheat from the chaff. Every customer and situation you 
encounter as a penetration tester will be different. That's not to say there won't be 
similarities, but as a whole, each job is different. 
When we discuss the difference, consider them in terms of different manage- 
ment, network architecture, applications, patch levels, policies, and employees. Each 
of these will impact your ability to have a successful penetration test. Penetration 
testers view each new organization as a puzzle. Imagine, if you will, that you're doing 
one of those maze puzzles found on the kids menu of the local hamburger joint. In 
the center of the maze you normally have the objective you must reach.Your 
starting point lies somewhere just outside the perimeter of the maze. Penetration 
testing is similar in that you come into the organization from an outside perspective 
and must find your way to the critical information that lies at the heart of that orga- 
nization (the maze). 
The real trick here is that each pathway to the data is littered with obstacles. To 
be successful, you'll need the ability to break through obstacles, or simply bypass 
them altogether. This is where creativity will really help. Remember, try to be flex- 
ible in your thought processes so every possible option will be available to you as 
you attempt to reach your goal.

Ethical Conduct 
Over the years, I've seen any number of people try to differentiate between malicious 
hackers (often referred to as crackers) and penetration testers. The truth is that knowl- 
edge-wise and mentally, they're nearly identical. The big differentiator is the ethical 
constraints that professional penetration testers apply to their conduct. Because they 
are employed by professional organizations, both commercially or for the federal gov- 
ernment, there are ethical standards that need to be constantly monitored. 
Don't get me wrong. The desire to solve the puzzle, and the burn to be suc- 
cessful, still exists in the penetration tester, as it does in most hackers. We still enjoy 
the thrill of victory, as it were, but we also understand that the work we do could 
potentially put the customer at risk and should be performed with caution. When 
performed correctly, a penetration test can be used to improve the customer's 
defenses and improve their overall security posture. 
Know When to Fold 
Knowing when to fold your cards is a classic poker strategy that has paid off for 
smart card players for years. The same holds true when considering a penetration 
test. There will be times when you want to spend more time on a particular area that 
looks vulnerable. Sometimes this will pay off by providing you with a pathway into 
the network. Other times, it may be a complete waste of effort. Knowing when to 
back off from one area of examination and move on is a critical skill to have. The 
sooner you can come to terms with the idea that you can't compromise every vul- 
nerability that exists, the sooner you can move on to more promising opportunities. 
This is important to understand. I've seen folks get completely sucked into the 
process of compromising a single, potential vulnerability, all the while ignoring more 
promising issues elsewhere. Remember, the objective is to gain control of the cus- 
tomer network and get at its critical information; it's not to find every vulnerability. 
We're just trying to work our way through the vulnerabilities with the most likeli- 
hood of compromise; sometimes referred to as the low-hanging fruit. If you get too 
absorbed in one area, you may miss something that could be the difference between 
success and failure. 
Use the Right Tools 
Regardless of your skill level or how long you've been a penetration tester, you will 
always need the right tools. It's hard to argue with a jury of your peers, so the best 
place to look for the most popular and useful tools publicly available right now is at

piles this list based on votes from professionals and hackers around the world. This 
top 100 list of applications is a must see for anyone in this line of business. 
Build Your Own 
Scripting and programming are your friends. That large majority of penetration 
testers that I know, who are actually quite successful at what they do, have a knack 
for creating scripts and programs that do a lot of the manual labor for them. For 
instance, resolving a complete IP address block through a domain name server using 
reverse lookups could provide a lot of useful information, but doing that type of 
work manually would be time consuming. The creation of script might take an 
hour, but the time it would save in the long run would more than compensate for 
that. By building your own tools, you can be assured you understand what the tool is 
doing, create more efficient methods for performing your tests, and put the informa- 
tion into a format that works for your own penetration processes. 
The Penetration Methodology 
We mentioned it briefly earlier, but let's look at a standard methodology often used 
by hackers and professionals alike. The methodology is intended to start with a high 
level overview of the organization and slowly work itself into the details. As we 
move our way down the methodology, we gain a better understanding of how the 
organization processes, stores, transmits, and protects its critical information. We have 
eight steps in this penetration methodology that we'll discuss in more detail.You can 
see these steps in Figure 9.2.

Information Gathering 
The first task on any penetration test is identifying what information you can glean 
from public resources. The most notable, and most used, medium for this work is the 
Internet. It's amazing the information you can get simply by using search engines 
like Google, scouring newsgroup archives, perusing mailing list archives, and looking 
at public records that the company has willingly released into the wild. 
Search Engines 
We won't go into too much detail on search engines since Johnny Long already cov- 
ered that, but suffice to say that this will be one of your first tasks. Looking through 
search engines using the correct syntax can reveal a plethora of very useful informa- 
tion to a penetration tester. Most search engines will do queries based on postings to 
www.syngress.com 

300 
Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
newsgroups, mailing lists, forums, and other forms of communication. They'll also 
search through information found on publicly available Web pages for your target, or 
their partner organizations. The most popular search engine used by penetration 
testers is undoubtedly Google. Regardless of what you use, though, make sure you 
understand the full list of options available to you in your search. For instance, 
Google comes with dozens and dozens of different search options that aren't com- 
monly known and may help you in your searches. 
Newsgroup Searches 
Newsgroups have been a huge part of the Internet for decades now. The most well 
known is the USENET newsgroups. They were around before the Web was graphi- 
cally based. These groups are basically huge message lists that users can subscribe to 
in order to watch for conversations or information on particular topics. 
For those of us that have been in the online world for the past 20 years or more, 
we've most certainly used these groups in the past to communicate with other pro- 
fessionals or hobbyists. For instance, if you're having issues with your router configu- 
ration, you might decide to post your question to a newsgroup. This allows 
hundreds, if not thousands, of other readers to view your question and respond to it. 
The cool part is that these messages are all archived on the Internet in a variety of 
places and can be located later by doing search queries. 
The following are some hints for performing these searches: 
9 
Search for the company name 
9 
Search for the company domain (for example, customer.org) 
9 
Search for the name of individuals you know work there (say, Joe Schmo) 
9 
Search for the company phone number 
9 
Search for the public IP address space of the customer 
Forums and Blogs 
Forums and blogs have started to slowly replace newsgroups in the public eye. All 
sorts of useful information can be found on public blogs or technical support 
forums. Administrators will often post messages to these types of communities in 
order to get feedback on particular technical issues that might be causing them 
headaches. They're also known to post in response to posts from other people around 
the world. Posts such as these might contain valuable information about the archi- 
tecture in use at the customer site. For instance, an administrator might post a 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
301 
response to a query on the forums stating something like, "In our organization, we 
use product X and I've found that if you configure it like this, the problem will go 
away."This information could help you focus your initial attacks on the organization 
Normal users and employees are oftentimes another way to find out what's in 
use at the organization. And because they're less likely to be educated in information 
security, they tend to provide more sensitive information in their posts. For example, 
let's say a user is having issues with a Web application in the organization. Instead of 
turning to their own administrators, which on multiple occasions have explained in 
clear, precise terms to the user how it's not really a problem, users will often post 
messages on forums instead. We've seen examples of information given out publicly 
to include application type, version number, patch level, configuration information, 
and, on occasion, actual code from the application. All of this information can be 
used to expand your attack. 
DNS / WHOIS / ARIN 
A number of protocols and services exist that operate on the Internet to keep the 
traffic moving back and forth. They're publicly available resources that, when used 
correctly, can provide the foundation of knowledge needed to map out the target 
organization. All of these protocols have been around for decades and provide vital 
information required to keep the Internet available and functioning. Using these ser- 
vices, we can create our target list, verify it, and check for errors or mistakes in our 
current target list. 
Domain Name Service (DNS) 
The first of these is called Domain Name Service, or DNS. DNS translated those 
hardware Internet addresses (such as 192.168.1.1) to names that are easier to 
remember. Each organization that has an Internet presence will have corresponding 
entries in a DNS server. If the server is privately held and operated, it may contain 
information on a good deal more computers than should be public knowledge. The 
DNS enumeration should be performed on the target customers' DNS servers in 
order to locate any unknown ways into the network. It's not unusual to find net- 
work administrators have created DNS entries to their home boxes to make connec- 
tions between home and work easier. That home computer may be the ticket into 
the corporate network. 
WHOIS 
The WHOIS provides information on the actual domain name(s) registered to a 
company or organization. For example, the simple command whois customertarget.com 
www.syngress.com 

302 
Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
will review information about the registration contact for the domain, the billing 
contact for the domain, and the technical or administrative contacts for it. It could 
also include phone numbers, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, and full names. 
ARIN 
The American Registry of Internet Numbers (AKIN) controls the dissemination 
and use of IP addresses employed by entities within the United States. The Web site, 
www.arin.net, provides a valuable resource to help verify the scope of a given pro- 
ject, or to determine if other addresses should be within scope. The information pro- 
vided to the user at this site looks quite similar to that of the WHOIS output, with 
the exception that the information provided relates to the organization that regis- 
tered the block of IP address space, versus the domain names. 
Web Site Mirroring 
Mirroring Web sites is a great way to get the files back on to your local machine for 
a closer look. For larger organizations, it's simply too big a task to go through each 
page online. Some mirroring tools, like wget under Linux, allow you to mirror just 
the information you want. Other tools, such as Sam Spade or Black Widow, will go 
a step further by parsing the information as it's downloaded, making it much quicker 
to spot hidden usernames, e-mail addresses, or passwords. 
Aside from hidden information, you can gain a plethora of useful tidbits about 
how the organization operates, important points of contact (useful for s~)cial engi- 
neering), important partners that may be linked from the pages, and other informa- 
tion that has made it into the public domain. We've even had some clients that 
posted their network architecture maps on their Web site for their customers to see. 
Talk about making things easier. 
Financial Web Sites 
Regardless of their line of business or the industry in which they operate, companies 
make money through interactions with customers and investors. Some of these com- 
panies are publicly traded on stock markets, while others may be privately held. Both 
entities, however, can be listed on financial news Web sites. 
This information is useful because it provides data on how the company operates 
financially, who it has acquired (or sold itself to) in recent history, and where impor- 
tant financial partnerships exist that may indicate a trusted technical relationship as 
well. Recent acquisitions for your target company can often provide an easy way 
into the customer network. It's often difficult to pull multiple organizations, which 
were previously autonomous, together into a single, cohesive, and standardized entity. 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
303 
Because of this, vulnerabilities may exist within the trust relationships that were 
developed to enable interaction between these entities. 
Network Enumeration 
Network enumeration is one of the most recognized hacker activities on the 
Internet. Because of its high-profile nature, dozens of tools and applications exist for 
performing these activities. The basic goal of network enumeration is to find out 
what components exist on the network, such as firewalls, computers, routers, 
switches, and printers. The port scan is the most familiar activity in this area. Port 
scans can be performed using any number of protocols, such as TCR UDP, and 
ICMP. The most popular port scan tool is by far Nmap, but you can find many other 
similar tools at www.sectools.org. 
Aside from finding out what components make up the target network, we also 
want to know what services, applications, and shared file systems are out there. 
Available services or applications may provide an avenue of attack, whereas shared 
file systems or printers could potentially allow an avenue of attack and access to sen- 
sitive information. Having this information will help you focus your attacks, saving 
time and effort on the penetration test. 
Vulnerability Identification 
Vulnerability scanning automates the process of determining what well-known vul- 
nerabilities exist on the network. Imagine having to look at every computer manu- 
ally, across the network, and trying to figure out what vulnerabilities existed. Some 
of these tools are freeware, such as Nessus (www.nessus.org), while others are com- 
mercial in nature, such as Saint (www.saintcorporation.com). The goal of this process 
is to collect as much useful information as we can in the shortest amount of time. 
The two tools listed in the previous paragraph are general vulnerability scanners 
and will attempt to find issues in a large number of services and host types across an 
organization's network. Other tools, such as SPI Dynamic's Weblnspect (www.spidy- 
namics.com) or NGS's NGSSQuirrel (www.nextgenss.com), specialize in vulnerabil- 
ities on specific applications. For example, the NGS application is written by some 
of the world's foremost experts in database security and will help locate issues in 
databases that could provide an avenue into the network. 
Vulnerability Exploitation 
Exploiting the vulnerabilities is what separates the professionals from the script kid- 
dies. The truth hurts, but a good many professionals in the security world depend 
r 
www.syngress.com 

304 
Chapter 9 9 The Basics of Penetration Testing 
wholly on the use of scripts and exploits written by other people. While this may be 
useful in some circumstances, the sole use of these exploits indicates the lack of 
maturity in the tester's knowledge and processes. A high quality tester will often have 
their own methods and scripts to help them break into a customer network. 
The painful truth, however, is that we can't all know everything. So, based on 
that, there will be times when everyone will need to use someone else's work. The 
thing to understand is that you need to be absolutely certain that the code is safe to 
use on the customer's network. Although we're trying to break into the network to 
get a foothold in as many boxes as possible, we're still there to help the customer, not 
bring them down. In this case, it's really helpful if you already know how to program 
and read code. 
The exploitation of vulnerabilities, whether taking advantage of a configuration 
issue or a software bug, provides us with the door into a single computer. This is the 
important first step that provides us with a normal user account. Everything else 
from here on out is based on this simple step. 
Privilege Escalation 
Once you find yourself in a target computer with a normal user account, you'll want 
to find a way to escalate your privilege to that of a root or Administrator user. In 
most cases, we'll concentrate on local Administrator or root access first, and then 
move on to the domain level access. The normal progression of access escalation is 
depicted in Figure 9.3.

Expansion of Reach 
Let's expand on the concept oi c access escalation a bit. In Figure 9.3, we kept things 
pretty simple by talking strictly about the access level of the accounts we were trying 
to compromise. If we take that one step further, we'll take the full network into 
account as well, versus a single host. Look at Figure 9.4 for an example.

............................................ you're most likely going to have a limited amount of time to compro- 
mise the customer resources. An attacker won't have those limitations, 
thus they can spend as much time breaking in as they need. What 
does this mean for you? It means you have to be better than an 
attacker in order to find those avenues into the customer network in 
a shorter period of time. You're going to have to go just as far in the 
network, if not further, with less time.

Ensure Future Access 
Once you've gained the access to key systems in the customer network, you don't 
want that access removed right when you need it. Some customers may notice odd 
things occurring on their network. For instance, Bill Morrison from the accounting 
office doesn't normally log in to the server at 11 P.m., or maybe there has been an 
unusually high level of Web traffic occurring during off hours. 
When this type of activity is noticed, the customer may cut off your access, 
either intentionally or unintentionally. To avoid this, you'll need to secure your 
future access to these systems through a number of possible means. These could 
include backdoor applications and/or additional privileged accounts. 
Backdoor applications often run in the background on a compromised system, 
allowing access back into the system at a later date. They often run on nonpopular 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
307 
ports and require a username and/or password to access the application. In instances 
of remote compromises, the backdoor will likely use a port that is allowed in and 
out through the firewall. Regardless of the port being utilized or the actual applica- 
tion in use, the goal is always the same: maintain and control access to compromised 
targets. In some cases, you may be able to simply create alternative administrative or 
root accounts. On systems that have hundreds of users, the new account isn't likely 
to ever be detected. 
'{i{~iii{!@A RNIN G 
~: 
The use of some backdoor applications could cause more issues for 
~!iiii!i!i!ii ~ your customer than good. For instance, there are a lot of these appli- 
i!iiiiiiiiiiiii~ cations in the public space, but if you don't have access to the source 
code, you can never be sure of how they really operate. What if the 
application leaves the customer vulnerable beyond what you believe? 
How will you ever be able to ensure the customer is secured from that 
point forward? The same holds true with root kits. Always make sure 
you're using only approved backdoor applications that you know for 
sure can't be hijacked by a real attacker. 
Compromise Information 
At the core of" any organization is certain information that is used on a daily basis to 
keep it profitable and in business. This could include customer data, such as credit 
card information, or it could include something much more sensitive, such as propri- 
etary research and development data. This information is the actual goal of any pene- 
tration test. After all, it doesn't matter if you can get into the network if you can't 
compromise the information, does it? 
You've gained account access, escalated that to administrative access, and 
expanded your access throughout the entire network. At this point, start looking for 
the treasure. Can you find those financial documents, research information, or 
patient health records?

...... tion to third parties or outside entities. Protect all access and informa- 
tion at the highest level of sensitivity possible. 
The Cleanup 
Once the job is done, present your findings to the customer and get ready for the 
cleanup. What? Surely you didn't think you were done.You've taken over user 
accounts, created your own administrative accounts, installed backdoors, changed 
passwords, and taken sensitive information from the customer network.You need to 
set everything right now. 
The first step is to go back through your notes and undo everything you've 
done. Let the customer know about all user accounts you had access to. They'll need 
to change passwords on all those accounts. Help the customer remove any backdoor 
applications you may have installed. Return all information you have obtained 
during your work and delete all soft copy information from your encrypted storage 
medium. 
And finally, answer any and all questions the customer may have concerning how 
you achieved such resounding success on their network. Part of your ethical duty to 
the customer is to perform a knowledge transfer, ensuring that the customer has a 
better understanding of the thought processes and techniques that an attacker would 
use to compromise their network. Understanding this will help the customer better 
protect themselves and their customers. 
Summary 
Most people who work in the field of penetration testing will tell you that it's a lot 
of fun.You're challenged with each new customer. But to be the most successful and 
helpful security professional you can be, you need to understand the entire security 
analysis life cycle and how you fit into it. 
The security analysis life cycle begins with a thorough look at the customer's 
programmatic and organizational processes. What policies are in place to protect the 
organization? Are those policies enforced? Are they focused on protecting those crit- 

The Basics of Penetration Testing 9 Chapter 9 
309 
ical pieces of information that the business relies on? What is the impact if the cus- 
tomer loses confidentiality, integrity, or availability of those information types? How 
is that information protected at a policy and human level? 
The next step is the technical evaluation that provides a comprehensive analysis 
of technical vulnerabilities at the customer organization. This piece of the life cycle 
looks at the network and the hosts. All applications and operating systems are taken 
into account. The goal is to find as many vulnerabilities as possible, and to allow the 
customer adequate opportunity to fix or mitigate those vulnerabilities. This is called 
customer mitigation and is the time when a customer builds their defenses. Finally, 
the customer tests their defense through the use of penetration testing. This is where 
you come in. 
Every good penetration tester has a hacker mentality. They use standard processes 
with each job, but also know when to step outside those lines and do things a bit 
differently. There is no shortage of good tools for performing this type of work, but 
having programming and scripting skills will only make your work better. 
A standard methodology for penetration testing includes the following steps: 
Information Gathering, Network Enumeration, Vulnerability Identification, 
Vulnerability Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Expansion of Reach, Future Access, 
and Information Compromise. Finally, once all these steps are complete, the profes- 
sional penetration tester will help the customer clean up their network and provide 
the customer with a full knowledge transfer. During the penetration testing process, 
copious notes should be taken to log each account or computer that has been modi- 
fied. These notes will be used during the cleanup phase. 
It should be noted that privilege escalation starts with obtaining a local user 
account and then trying to escalate that to a local administrator account. From this 
point, we'll try to escalate to a domain level user or administrative account. Another 
important note is that escalation also consists of expanding your access across the 
network. For instance, you may initially compromise a single computer, but you're 
goal is to expand that access to as many other hosts and network components as 
possible.

Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
Introduction 
[Syngress Publishing, along with Greg Kipper, would like to thank Auerbach 
Publications for letting us use a portion of Greg's book, Investigator's Guide to 
Steganography, as a starting point for this chapter.] 
When I was approached to contribute a chapter to this book, I was excited to 
have the chance to revisit steganography again since finishing my first book 
Investigator's Guide to Steganography in 2002. This chapter will follow much the same 
model as my book did by approaching steganography in the context of how it fits into 
the real world. This chapter has no code and is meant for everyone from forensic 
investigators to security managers. It is my goal here to give you a solid understanding 
of the basics of steganography, what it can and can't do, and to arm you with enough 
information to determine where it fits into the particulars of your specific career path. 
Defining Steganography 
Steganography, in its most basic definition, is a type of hidden communication that 
literally means "covered writing." Another excellent definition for steganography is 
"hiding in plain sight." Steganography is where the message is out in the open, often 
for all to see, but goes undetected because the very existence of the message is a 
secret. In short, the communication is taking place right in front of someone's eyes, 
but unless they're in the know (meaning the sender or recipient), the message goes 
unnoticed. In contrast, cryptography is where the message is scrambled, and unread- 
able, but the existence of a message is often known, or at the very least easy to iden- 
tify because of its unreadable nature. Often times throughout history, encrypted 
messages have been intercepted but have not been decoded. While this protects the 
information hidden in the cipher, the interception of the message can be just as 
damaging because it tells an opponent or enemy that someone is communicating 
with someone else. Steganography takes the opposite approach and attempts to hide 
all evidence that communication is even taking place. 
Some Useful Definitions

Cover Medium The medium in which we want to hide data. It can be 
an innocent looking piece of information for steganography, or an impor- 
tant medium that must be protected for copyright or integrity reasons.

Stego Medium The resulting combination of a cover medium and an 
embedded message and a stego key.

Payload The amount of information that can be stored in the cover 
media. Typically, the greater the payload, the greater the risk of detection. 
The following is a side-by-side comparison of some of the characteristic differ- 
ences between steganography and cryptography: 
9 
Steganography Hides a message within another message, so it appears 
and functions like a picture, video, or sound file. 
9 
Cryptography The message is encrypted; looks like a meaningless jumble 
of characters. 
9 
Steganography A collection of graphic images, video files, or sound files 
on a disk that may not look suspicious~in fact, this is often quite normal, 
especially on a personal computer. 
9 
Cryptography A collection of random characters on a disk may look sus- 
picious and is almost always a red flag during a forensic analysis. 
9 
Steganography A smart eavesdropper can detect something suspicious 
from a sudden change of message format. For example, a user suddenly 
stops sending pictures and starts sending sound files. 
9 
Cryptography Most eavesdroppers can detect a secret communication from 
a message that has been cryptographically encoded; also called traffic analysis. 
9 
Steganography Requires caution when reusing pictures or sound files.

Cryptography Requires caution when reusing keys.

Steganography No laws are currently associated with steganography.

Cryptography Some laws ban cryptography. 
The Differences between 
Steganography and Watermarking 
Watermarking and steganography differ in an important way. Steganographic infor- 
mation, in order to be effective, must never be apparent to a viewer unaware of its 
presence. This feature is optional when it comes to watermarking since there are 
both visible and invisible watermarks. 
The Prisoners' Problem 
To illustrate how steganography works in practice, let's look at the most commonly 
used example, which was described by G. Simmons in what he called "The 
Prisoners' Problem." It goes like this: Alice and Bob (our two tic 

314 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
have been arrested and placed in different cells. Their goal is to develop an escape 
plan and bust out of jail. The snag is that their only way to communicate is through 
the warden, Wendy. Wendy being an alert and able warden will definitely not allow 
Alice and Bob to communicate in code (encryption) and if she should notice any- 
thing suspicious, one or both will immediately be put in solitary confinement. So 
Alice and Bob must communicate in a manner that will not arouse suspicion. Thus, 
they must communicate invisibly, using steganography. 
The scenario goes on to explain that a smart way of doing this would be to hide 
the information in an innocuous looking message or picture. Bob could draw a pic- 
ture of a blue cow in a green pasture, and then ask Wendy to pass it along to Alice. 
Wendy would of course look at it before passing it on, and thinking it just a piece of 
abstract art, would hand it to Alice not knowing that the colors in the picture con- 
veyed a message to her. 
While this method can work in theory, some problems could stop the escape. 
Wendy may accidentally or purposely alter the picture and therefore change or 
destroy the message. IfWendy did purposely alter the picture, thereby destroying the 
message, it would be considered an active steganographic attack. We'll talk about this 
method of attack and others later in the chapter. The Prisoner's Problem model can 
be applied to a lot of situations where steganography might be used for communica- 
tion. Alice and Bob are the two parties who want to communicate, and Wendy is the 
eavesdropper, and while this model can be an effective means of communication if 
used properly, it's also important to recognize and consider the potential of passive, 
active, or malicious attacks. 
History and Steganography 
In recent years, I've noticed that the general public's awareness of steganography has 
grown significantly. The reasons for this are varied. Some of the awareness came from 
the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, where speculation 
swirled around steganography as one method the terrorists used to communicate 
attack plans. The success of Dan Brown's bestseller The DaVinci Code, whose story- 
line is loaded with steganography, and the growing awareness of security (and pri- 
vacy) in home and work environments (and everything in between) have helped this 
issue seep into the public consciousness as well. To drag out the tired clich4 that 
"those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it" this next section will give 
you some interesting insights and context into steganography by showcasing some of 
the prominent people, events, and methods used throughout history.

315 
The Greeks 
In The Histories, Herodotus documented several instances where steganography was 
used. One such case involved a Greek named Histaiaeus, who wanted to encourage 
Aristagoras of Miletus to revolt against the Persian king, and managed to do so in a 
rather inventive way. In order to pass these instructions securely, Histaiaeus shaved the 
head of his messenger, wrote the message on his bare scalp, and then waited for the 
hair to grow back. When the messenger reached his destination~and Aristagoras~his 
head was shaved and the message read. While this certainly isn't the quickest method 
of communication, it was very effective since the messenger was able to pass guard 
inspections without harassment since he was carrying nothing suspicious. 
A more modern variant of this same idea was used in the William Gibson story, 
and later movie, called Johnny Mnemonic. In the story, Johnny, an information courier 
played by Keanu Reeves, has 80GB of data storage implanted in his head where 
clients upload sensitive information that he then physically and covertly carries to its 
intended recipient, bypassing traditional communication channels. 
The Chinese 
The Chinese used steganography during the Yuan @nasty to revolt when China was 
ruled by the Mongolian people. The leaders of the time, unhappy at having to 
submit to foreign rule, created an inventive method of coordinating the rebellion 
without being discovered. The rebel leaders, knowing that the Moon Festival was 
drawing near, ordered the making of special cakes called "moon cakes." Baked into 
each moon cake was a message with the outline of the attack. On the night of the 
Moon Festival, the cakes were dispersed, the messages read, and the rebels success- 
fully attacked and overthrew the government. What followed was the establishment 
of the Ming @nasty. Today, moon cakes are eaten to commemorate this legend. 
Gaspar Schott 
Gaspar Schott in his book Schola Steganographica described a method of encoding 
secret information by matching letters to specific musical notes. This "music" would 
never be pleasant to listen to if played, but to the untrained eye it would appear to 
be normal sheets of music when, in fact, it was an encoded message. 
Giovanni Porta 
Italian scientist Giovanni Porta, born in 1535, made contributions both to steganog- 
raphy and cryptography. Porta described a method of how to conceal a message 
within a hard-boiled egg by making a type of ink from a mixture of alum and

vinegar and then using it to write on the shell. The solution would penetrate the 
porous shell, and leave a message on the surface of the hardened egg albumen, which 
can be read only when the shell is removed. 
Girolamo Cardano 
The Cardano Grille system may be something you're already familiar with, although 
you may never have heard the name Cardano. The basics are that each recipient has a 
piece of paper with several holes cut it. When the "grille" (the piece of paper with 
holes) is placed over an innocuous looking message, the holes in the grille line up 
with words in the larger message and reveal the hidden message. Anyone intercepting 
the message would be nescient to the fact, because the words the grille sees have 
been hidden in a larger message that takes up the entire page. Providing that the 
sender is a decent wordsmith with a good imagination, even difficult messages can 
be sent with the grille while the larger message will still be literate and also sound 
meaningful. 
Another way to use the grille method is to take a page from a book and employ 
certain letters within the words on the page to create the grille. Once the grille is 
passed to the intended recipient, that person only has to have the book, or the page 
of the book, that corresponds to the grille to retrieve the message. 
The Culpers 
Steganography played a role in the Revolutionary War and helped George 
Washington on many occasions. The code ring consisted of five people and used the 
codename Samuel Culper. Several trial and error attempts at secret communication 
prompted The Culpers to adopt invisible ink as one of their security precautions. 
The invisible ink was used on a blank piece of paper, and after the message was 
written, was reinserted into a ream of new, blank paper. Washington knew that by 
counting from the top down to a specific sheet how to find the hidden message. He 
would then apply a second solution to make the ink appear. A concern of 
Washington's was that carrying around blank sheets of paper would create suspicion, 
so he ordered that the invisible ink also be used on regular messages, and that the 
secret message be written between the lines or under the message. 
Civil War Rugs 
A form of steganography was used prior to the Civil War to aid slaves in escaping to 
freedom. In the 1800s, the underground railroad was one of the main escape routes 
used by slaves. Quilts, which were hung outside to dry, became an ideal way to 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
317 
display information inconspicuously. The quilts would have special patterns sewn 
into them which would convey messages to prepare or provide direction to escaping 
slaves who knew what to look for. 
World War l 
During World War I there were several periods and instances where steganography 
was used with success. One method was called a Turning Grille; this took Cardano's 
Grille method and enhanced it. The Turning Grille looked like a normal grille (a 
square sheet of cardboard) divided into cells, with some of the cells punched out. To 
use the Turning Grille, the encoder would write the first sequence of letters, and 
then rotate the grille 90 degrees, write the second sequence of letters, and so on, 
rotating the grille after each sequence. 
There was also a record during the war of a cable censor who received the mes- 
sage "Father is dead."The censor changed the message to "Father is deceased."A 
reply came back: "Is Father dead or deceased?" 
World War II 
Steganography, and its prevention, were also prevalent in World War II. After the 
attack on Pearl Harbor the United States enacted a censorship organization. This 
organization worked to think of ways that coded messages could be passed in the 
open and took steps to stop them or, if" there was a message, destroy the code. 
Chess games were banned by mail, crossword puzzles were examined or removed 
from correspondence, newspaper clippings and student's grades were removed. 
Stamps were removed and replaced with ones of equal value but different 
denominations or numbers. Children's pictures were replaced, Xs and Os from love 
letters were removed, and of course blank paper was replaced and tested for invisible 
ink. Mass media was censored, too. Telephone and telegraph requests for special 
songs were not allowed and mail-in song requests would be held for a random 
amount of time before being played. 
The Vietnam War 
Another, and well-publicized, example of steganography happened during the height 
of the Vietnam War. Commander Jeremiah Denton, a naval pilot who had been shot 
down and captured, was paraded around by the North Vietnamese in front of the 
news as part of a propaganda event. Knowing that he was under the proverbial 
microscope and unable to say anything openly critical about his captors, he blinked 
his eyes in Morse code, spelling out T-O-R-T-U-R-E, as he spoke to the media.

Analog Steganography 
In the previous section, we covered some of the very basics of what steganography is 
and isn't, along with some creative uses of it throughout history. In this section, I will 
flush out some of the specific techniques of"analog" steganography~meaning no 
comPuters are used in the creation or transmission of the message~to further your 
knowledge and provide some contrast for the next section, which delves into the 
realm of digital steganography. 
Microdots 
The microdot is a page-sized photograph that has been reduced to 1 mm in diam- 
eter. The microdot became a popular and commonly used form of steganography 
during WWII. The process of creating a microdot is pretty straightforward, but 
requires a few specialized pieces of equipment. First, a photograph of the message is 
taken, which reduces it to roughly the size of a postage stamp. Next, the image is 
shrunk further with a reverse microscope, bringing it down to 1 millimeter. The 
negative is then developed and the image is punched out of the film.A common 
way to do this was with a syringe needle whose point had been filed down. Once 
the needle separated the dot from the rest of the film, it was placed on the cover 
text, over a period or under a stamp, and cemented in place. Professor Walter Zapp, a 
German, is credited with creating a device that could perform most of these pro- 
cesses mechanically. 
One-Time Pads 
A one-time pad is a method of encoding a message with a random key once, and 
only once. This type of encoding is an unbreakable system, because no matter how 
much time or sample text a cryptanalyst had available, breaking the code would be 
impossible. The cipher would never be the same twice. 
Semagrams 
A semagram is essentially nothing more than a symbol. Its literal meaning is, in fact, 
semantic symbol. Semagrams are associated with a concept and do not use writing 
to hide a message. Remember our example in the Prisoners' problem. Bob sent a 
picture to Alice, where the picture, or more specifically, characteristics about the pic- 
ture, conveyed secret information. A semagram can be almost anything that doesn't 
use words to hide a message.

319 
Null Ciphers 
A null cipher is an unencrypted message crafted in such a way that the real message 
is "camouflaged" in a larger, innocent-sounding message. A null cipher is also some- 
times referred to as an open code. Null ciphers have one big drawback: sometimes 
they don't always "sound" quite right. The message may read clumsily, and because of 
this, suspected messages were detected my mail filters, although many innocent- 
sounding messages often went undetected. 
An example of a message containing null ciphers is 
Fishing freshwater bends and saltwater coasts rewards anyone 
feeling stressed. Resourceful anglers usually find masterful 
leapers fun and admit swordfish rank overwhelming anyday. 
Taking the third letter in every word, the following message emerges: 
Send lawyers guns and money 
Type Spacing and Offsetting 
Type spacing or type offsetting is a subtle way of distorting the text in a message to 
hide additional data. Type spacing was created as a way to discourage illegal copying 
of textual material. While this makes its invented purpose technically a form of 
watermarking, type spacing can also be used to send a message in secret. To encode a 
secret message using type spacing, all one would have to do is adjust specific letters 
ever so slightly from their normal position. The letters that are out of position indi- 
cate the secret message. 
Invisible Ink 
Invisible inks are colorless liquids that require heat, light, or a special chemical to 
change its color and make it visible. The basics behind reactions that don't use heat 
involve an acid or a base, and a PH indicator. The colorless liquid, which is either an 
acid or base, is applied to paper and dries, making it invisible. When a PH indicator 
is introduced, it reacts with the acid or base properties of the dried liquid and 
changes color. Several types of liquids that work well as invisible inks have been used 
throughout history. Some of them are milk, vinegar, lemon juice, and even urine. 
Newspaper Code 
During the Victorian era, newspapers could be sent without charge. As a result, the 
poorer classes of the time made use of this and invented the newspaper code. The

320 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
process couldn't be more straightforward. Holes were poked just above the letters in 
the newspaper so that when the dots were transcribed off the newspaper and written 
together, the secret message would be revealed. While this method of steganography 
took a fair amount of time, it did allow people to communicate freely. 
Jargon Code 
A jargon coded message changes words instead of replacing individual letters. Jargon 
code is word-crafting at its finest, and usually requires a good bit of imagination on 
the part of the sender. A number of years ago, I worked a summer job at Disneyland 
as one of the boat drivers on "The Jungle Cruise." After being there for a couple of 
weeks, I was introduced to the local jargon code that the male employees would use 
to tell other male employees an attractive woman was in the vicinity. The word was 
"Alp," and it was surprisingly effective for those of us who knew what to listen for. 
This one word allowed a few young men to effectively communicate in crowds of 
several hundred people at a time without drawing undue attention. This example is 
certainly one of the simplest forms of jargon code. Normally it is something more 
than just one word, but it illustrates the point of communicating out in the open 
quite well without anyone noticing. 
Digital Steganography 
Around 1996, digital steganography really started coming into its own. It became 
something more and more people were talking about and experimenting with. 
Today, when most people think of steganography, they think of"digital steganog- 
raphy"~hiding secret messages in pictures, on public Web sites, and so on. With the 
history lesson behind us, let's dive into the details of the types, techniques, and tools 
of digital steganography. 
Steganography Techniques 
When it's all said and done, there are really only three ways to hide a digital message 
in a digital cover. The basic three are the injection, substitution, and generation of 
new files. 
Injection 
Data injection takes the secret message and directly embeds it in the host medium 
(picture, sound file, or video clip). The problem with this kind of embedding is that 
it usually makes the host file larger; therefore, the alteration is easier to detect. 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
321 
Substitution 
Normal data is replaced, or substituted, with the secret data. This usually results in 
very little size changes to the host file. However, depending on the type of host file 
and/or the amount of hidden data, the substitution method can degrade the quality 
of the original host file. 
Generation of New Files 
A cover file is generated for the sole purpose of concealing a secret message. As illus- 
trated in the Prisoners' Problem, Bob creates a picture of something innocent that 
can be passed to Alice. The innocent picture is the cover that provides the mecha- 
nism for conveying the message, which in that example was the particular color of a 
COW. 
A more modern form of generation of new files is the program Spam Mimic. 
Spam Mimic embeds a text message within a rather daunting piece of spam that can 
be e-mailed to an intended recipient. While this generated spam doesn't make a 
whole lot of sense, it makes enough sense to be believable, and that's all that's 
needed. 
The Six Categories of Steganography 
In all methods of steganography, something is being done to conceal a message. 
Naturally, these actions or techniques can be separated and analyzed to learn what's 
happening during the whole process. The six categories of steganography are substi- 
tution system techniques, transform domain techniques, spread spectrum techniques, 
statistical method techniques, distortion techniques, and cover generation techniques. 
We'll look at each of these, one at a time. 
Substitution System 
Substitution system steganography replaces redundant or unneeded bits of a cover 
with the bits from the secret message. Several available steganography tools use the 
Least Significant Bit (LSB) method of encoding the secret message. LSB works like 
this. In a digital cover file, there is a tremendous amount of wasted or redundant 
space. It is this space that the steganography program will take advantage of and use 
to hide another message (on the bit level) within the digital cover. 

322 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
Transform Domain Techniques 
The transform domain technique is also very effective, but is a little trickier to 
explain. Basically, transform domain techniques hide message data in the "transform 
space" of a signal. If you're saying to yourself, "Huh?," hold on and I'll explain. Every 
day on the Internet, people send pictures back and forth, and most often they use a 
JPEG format. JPEGs are interesting in that they compress themselves when they 
close. In order for this to take place, they have to get rid of excess data (excess bits) 
that would otherwise prevent them from compressing. During compression, a JPEG 
will make an approximation of itself to become smaller. This change transforms 
space; thus, it can be used to hide information. 
Spread Spectrum Techniques 
In this section we briefly define two types of spread spectrum techniques: direct 
sequence and frequency hopping. 
In direct sequence spread spectrum, the stream of information to be transmitted 
is divided into small pieces, each of which is allocated to a frequency channel spread 
across the spectrum. A data signal at the point of transmission is combined with a 
higher data-rate bit sequence (also known as a chipping code) that divides the data 
according to a spreading ratio. The redundant chipping code helps the signal resist 
interference and also enables the original data to be recovered if data bits are dam- 
aged during transmission. 
Frequency hopping is when a broad slice of the bandwidth spectrum is divided 
into many possible broadcast frequencies. In general, frequency-hopping devices use 
less power and are cheaper, but the performance of direct sequence spread spectrum 
systems is usually better and more reliable. 
Statistical Methods 
Statistical methods use what's called a "l-bit" steganographic scheme. This scheme 
embeds one bit of information only in a digital carrier and thus creates a statistical 
change, even if it's only a slight one. A statistical change in the cover indicates a 1, 
while a cover left unchanged indicates a 0. This system works based on the receiver's 
ability to distinguish between modified and unmodified covers. 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
323 
Distortion Techniques 
The distortion method of steganography creates a change in a cover object to hide 
information. The secret message is recovered when the algorithm compares the 
changed and/or distorted cover with the original. 
Cover Generation Methods 
Cover generation methods are probably the most unique of the six types. Typically, a 
cover object is chosen to hide a message in, but that's not the case here. A cover gen- 
eration method actually creates a cover for the sole purpose of hiding information. 
Spam Mimic is an excellent example of a cover generation method. 
Types of Steganography 
Now that we've looked at the categories of stego, let's look at the two types of stego: 
linguistic and technical. 
Linguistic Steganography 
Linguistic steganography can be described quite simply as any form of steganography 
that uses language in the cover. A number of forms of linguistic steganography are 
covered in the next sections, but the two most basic categories are open codes and 
text semagrams. 
A program that takes advantage of linguistic steganography is NICETEXT, 
which uses the technique of linguistic steganography in a very inventive way. The 
goal of NICETEXT is to provide a program that can transform cipher text 
(encrypted text) into text that looks like natural language, while still providing a 
cover for the original cipher text. An added benefit of this type of program is that it 
can be applied to many different languages. 
Text Semagrams 
Text Semagrams work with graphical modifications of the text, such as type-spacing 
and offsetting. They concern details that are tiny, but nonetheless visible. Certain 
methods work without text as well. These are called real semagrams. 
Technical Steganography 
Technical steganography is a little broader in scope since it doesn't necessarily deal 
with the written word, even though it communicates information. Technical 
www.syngress.com 

324 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
steganography is the method of steganography where a tool, device, or method is 
used to conceal the message. Let's have a look at some technical steganography 
methods. 
Embedding Methods 
The technical challenges of data hiding are formidable.Any "holes" to fill with data 
in a host file, either statistical or perceptual, are likely targets for removal by lossy 
compression. The key to successful data hiding is the finding of holes that are not 
suitable for exploitation by compression algorithms. 
Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the substitution method of steganography where the 
right-most bit in a binary notation, the bit with the least impact on the binary data, 
is replaced with a bit from the embedded message. This method provides "security 
through obscurity," a technique that can be rendered useless if an attacker knows the 
technique is being used. 
Transform Techniques 
Three main types of transform techniques can be used when embedding a message 
in steganography. They are the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the Discrete 
Fourier Transform, and the Wavelet Transform, which simply embeds the secret data 
in the cover during the transformation process in various ways. 
Spread-Spectrurn Encoding 
Spread-spectrum encoding is the method of hiding a small or narrow-band signal (a 
message) in a large or wide band cover. The foundation of this process begins with a 
spread spectrum encoder. The encoder works by modulating a narrow band signal 
over a carrier. The carrier's signal is continually shifted using a noise generator and a 
secret key that makes the noise seem random. The message is embedded in the 
existing noise of the carrier signal. This spreads the narrow signal over a wide area, 
decreasing the density of the hidden signal and making it much more difficult to 
detect within the overall carrier signal. 
Perceptual Masking 
This form of steganography occurs when one signal, or sound, becomes impercep- 
tible to the observer because of the presence of another signal. This method also 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
325 
exploits the weaknesses of the human visual and auditory systems. A common 
example that almost everyone has seen is in spy films where someone is trying to 
communicate with someone else in a room they know is bugged. Usually the secret 
agent will turn up the stereo, run the shower, or do some other innocent (but noisy) 
task that allows a whispered conversation to take place without being heard. 
Steganography 
Applied to Different Media 
When you get right down to it, digital steganography is really just the digital manip- 
ulation of ls and 0s. This fact allows for several choices of cover media since we 
know that whether it is a document, picture, video, or even a file system, in the end 
it's all just binary. In this next section, we'll look at how stego manipulation can be 
applied to a wide variety of digital media. 
Still Images" Pictures 
The methods of steganography are quite varied. With still images, LSB insertion and 
spread spectrum techniques are commonly used. Texture block is another method. 
Texture block uses low bit-rate data hiding and is accomplished by copying a region 
from a random texture pattern in a picture to an area of similar texture resulting in a 
pair of identically "textured" regions in a picture. 
Moving Images" Video 
Steganography, when applied to a video file such as an .avi or .mpg, typically uses 
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) manipulation, meaning that as the video is com- 
pressed and/or decompressed, secret data can be added during the transformation 
process. 
Audio Files 
The following are various audio file methods: 
9 
LSB insertion The bit with the least impact on the binary data is 
replaced with a bit from the embedded message. 
9 Differential phase variation The sound file is divided into blocks, and 
the initial phase of the sound file is modified with the secret message, pre- 
serving the following relative phase shifts. This is an effective method given 
it has a low signal-to-noise ratio.

Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
9 
Spread spectrum schemes The method of hiding a small- or narrow- 
band signal, the secret message, in a large- or wide-band cover. 
9 Adding echo to the audio signal A slight echo is added to the signal 
using two different delays to encode the 1 and 0 bits. The echo is too slight 
to be perceived by the human ear. 
Text Files 
Three methods exist for text files: 
[] 
Open-space The use of white space between words or sentences to hide 
data. 
9 
Syntactic Uses modification of the word order or punctuation to hide a 
message. 
[] 
Semantic Uses synonyms to encode a secret message. See the example in 
the section titled "World War I" ("Is Father dead or deceased?"). 
Steganographic File Systems 
This is another particularly interesting way of applying steganography. Let's take a 
closer look. A steganographic file system is a method of storing files in such a way 
that it encrypts data and hides it so well that it can't be proven it's there. 
A steganographic file system can 
9 
Hide users' documents in other seemingly random files. 
[] 
Allow the owner to give names and passwords for some files while keeping 
others secret. 
9 
Behave like a second layer of secrecy. Encrypted files are out in the open 
and visible, but not understandable. Stego files aren't even visible, and an 
outsider can't look for files that "aren't there." 
Hiding in Disk Space 
Three main methods exist for hiding data in disk space: unused sectors, hidden parti- 
tions, and slack space. In this section, we'll take a closer look at how each is carried 
out. 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
327 
U nused Sectors 
Similar to the method used in the "Steganographic File Systems" section, tools that 
hide data in unused sectors, such as S-tools, will take the file and spread the bits out 
throughout the free space on the floppy. Though undetectable in the normal 
Windows viewer, the file is still there. 
Hidden Partitions 
A hidden partition on a hard drive is another way of hiding information, sometimes 
large amounts, in plain sight. This method isn't terribly robust since a close examina- 
tion of the hard drive, independent of the operating system, will usually reveal that 
the drive is bigger than the OS is letting on. 
Slack Space 
Slack space is a type of unused space in a disk. Even if the actual data being stored 
requires less storage than the cluster size, an entire cluster is reserved for the file. The 
unused space is called the slack space. If minimum space allocated is 32kb and the file 
is 6kb, then 26kb is left unused and considered unavailable by the operating system. 
This unused space (slack space) could be used to hide information without showing 
up in any directory or file system. 
Hiding in Network Packets 
A covert channel is described as "any communication channel that can be exploited 
by a process to transfer information in a manner that violates the systems security 
policy." Essentially, it is a method of communication, referred to as Internet 
Steganography, that is not part of an actual computer system design, but can still be 
used to transfer information to users or system processes that normally would not 
have access to the information. Hiding information within network packets can be 
accomplished a couple of ways. One is Packet Header Manipulation, which hides 
data in empty fields of the packet header, and Packet "sorting," which re-sorts 
packets in such a way that their sequence carries with it a meaning of either 1 or 0, 
which will ultimately yield a hidden message.

Issues in Information Hiding 
Most things in life require trade-offs of some sort. Something for nothing isn't the 
way the universe works, and information hiding is no exception. The following is a 
list of limitations associated with trying to hide information steganographically. 
Levels of Visibility 
When you are looking at the first issue in information hiding, determining levels of 
visibility can be done by asking one question. Does the embedding process distort 
the cover to the point where it is visually noticeable? If the image is unacceptably 
distorted, the carrier isn't sufficient for the payload; if it isn't distorted, the carrier is 
adequate. 
Robustness vs. Payload 
To have a robust method of" embedding the message, you must have redundancy to 
resist changes made to the cover. This redundancy subsequently lowers the payload. 
The exact opposite is also true. With little or no redundancy (robustness), the 
payload of the secret message can be larger. 
more robust = lower payload 
less robust = higher payload 
File Format Dependence 
Some image and sound files are either lossy or lossless. The conversion of lossless 
information to the compressed "lossy" information can destroy the hidden informa- 
tion in the cover. A good example is to think of the conversion of an uncompressed 
bitmap to a compressed, estimated jpeg. The compression and estimation change the 
bits to include the bits that might be the embedded message. 
Watermarking 
The definition of watermarking is "a form of marking that embeds copyright infor- 
mation about the artist or owner." In the traditional manufacture of paper, wet fiber 
is subjected to high pressure to expel the moisture. If the press's mold has a slight 
pattern, this pattern leaves an imprint in the paper~a watermark~which is best 
viewed under transmitted light. Today, the word "watermark" has been borrowed by 
high technology. Digital watermarks are imperceptible (or barely perceptible) trans- 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
329 
formations of digital data. Often, the digital data set is a digital multimedia object. 
While digital images are most often mentioned in the same breath as digital water- 
marking, we note that watermarks can be applied to other forms of digital data, such 
as pictures, videos, and music. 
Classification of Watermarks 
In this section we briefly discuss two types of watermarks: fragile and robust. 
Fragile 
The fragile watermark is one of the watermarking methods for authentication that 
has a low robustness towards modifications, where even a small change of the con- 
tent will destroy embedded information, showing an attack attempt was made. In 
short, fragile watermarks are supposed to break. Think of it as a digital version of the 
foil put under the cap of an aspirin bottle. It's pretty hard to get by that without it 
looking like it's been tampered with. 
Robust 
A robust watermark is almost exactly the opposite of a fragile watermark. A robust 
watermark can be either visible or invisible, depending on its purpose. Robust 
watermarks are very difficult to remove or damage. The easiest example of a robust 
watermark can be seen any time you turn on the television. CNN, ESPN, and the 
Sci-Fi Channel all have a watermark in the lower right-hand corner, not only to let 
you know what station you're on, but also to let you know that what you're 
watching is their content. Removing a visible watermark, especially in the television 
example, would be very difficult to do without someone noticing after the fact. 
Steganography Tools 
There are literally hundreds of steganography tools available on the Internet, and 
new ones are being released all the time. Using the same list I outlined in the earlier 
section "Steganography Applied to Different Media," I've listed some tools that will 
allow you to use steganography on a variety of digital media. 
Still Images" Pictures 
Blindside is an application that allows you to conceal a file, or set of files, within a 
single digital image. The resulting image appears identical to the human eye, but can 
typically contain around 50k of secret data. The concealed files can also be password 
protected. Blindside operates by creating slight color inflections in an image which, 
www.syngress.com 

330 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
although invisible to the human eye, can free up a great deal of space in which to 
store information. A proprietary cryptographic algorithm can also be used to 
scramble the data with a secret pass phrase. 
Moving Images" ideo 
Info Stego (see Figure 10.1) is a steganography and watermarking tool that lets you 
protect your private information, secret communications, and legal copyright using 
information watermark and data encryption technology. Info Stego can hide your 
important information or copyright mark inside another file, which can be picture, 
sound, or video. Also, as with any steganography or watermarking program, other 
people can't notice the file change. 
Figure 10.1 The Info Stego Interface 
Audio Files 
MASKER is a steganography and encryption program that supports several high- 
performance coding algorithms, including Cast-256, Blowfish-256, Rijndael-256, 
and Twofish-256. The cover image can be an audio file, a program, or a video file. 
Even after the hidden information is embedded, the file will still be fully functional. 
Additionally, files can be compressed for network transmission. 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
331 
Text Files 
KPKFile provides security for your sensitive files by encrypting and hiding them. It 
has a steganography option, allowing the user to bury an encrypted file within 
another still working file, such as a Microsoft Word document or a bitmap image. 
KPKFile can also create secret folders that are impossible to access without the 
proper password. 
Steganographic File Systems 
BackYard is just one example of a steganographic file system program that can com- 
pletely hide and protect your files, folders, and drives by making them completely 
inaccessible, meaning completely hidden from the Windows operating system, and 
rendering them write protected.You can use any other protection scheme you 
specify. Different protection profiles can be created with different files and directo- 
ries, and be activated with a single hotkey, bProtected, Bury Bury, Dark Files, Disk 
Hide, and Drive Hider are some other examples of stego file systems. 
Real-World Uses 
In the grand scheme, it is fair to say there are very few legitimate uses for steganog- 
raphy. While it is often common to consider an invisible watermark and steganog- 
raphy synonymous, there are actually a couple significant differences between the 
two, mainly intent and the type of information encoded in the cover medium. 
In today's workplace, the strained balance between computer security and 
employee privacy is growing more and more unstable. This instability creates an 
environment where steganography could be used as a very effective way of bypassing 
normal communication channels. Web mail or other Internet-based meeting places 
are being used as ways of communicating outside and around the firewall. With 
security and privacy policies on everyone's mind, both employees and employers 
alike, steganography may become the next big obstacle security officers have to face 
when it comes to controlling communication within their networks. 
As to other darker activities such as terrorism, espionage, insider threats, and crim- 
inal activities, analog forms of steganography have been used in the past with great 
success, and there is nothing to suggest that digital steganography isn't being used 
now, and won't continue to be in the future. Often, the argument arises that "we're 
just not seeing any evidence of steganography being used," which unfortunately for 
the people charged with investigating these matters is exactly the point. One isn't 
supposed to see any evidence, since that's steganography's invented purpose.

Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
Detection and Attacks 
Steganography detection is usually a very difficult task, especially in instances of low 
payloads, since fewer bits are replaced, altered, or inserted. However, there are some 
ways to tell. The following is a list of methods, and a partial list of tools, used for 
detecting steganography. 
Detection 
Statistical Tests 
Statistical tests can reveal that an image has been modified by determining that its 
statistical properties deviate from the norm. Some tests are independent of the data 
format and lust measure the entropy of the redundant data. Expect images with 
hidden data to have a higher entropy than those without. 
Stegdetect 
Stegdetect is an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images. It is 
capable of detecting several different steganographic methods to embed hidden 
information in JPEG images. 
Stegbreak 
Stegbreak is a program that uses dictionary guessing to break the encoding password. 
It is used to launch dictionary attacks against JSteg-Shell, JPHide, and OutGuess. 
Visible Noise 
Attacks and analysis on hidden information may take several forms: detecting, 
extracting, and disabling or destroying hidden information. Images with too large a 
payload may display distortions from hidden information. Selecting the proper com- 
bination of steganography tools and carriers is important to successful information 
hiding. 
Appended Spaces and "Invisible" Characters 
Appended spaces and "invisible" characters refers back to the technique of hiding 
data in spaces within text. 
This form of text semagram uses the white space in a document to denote 
binary values. The white space can be between individual words, sentences, or even 

What Is Steganography? 9 Chapter 10 
333 
between paragraphs. Almost any combination is possible, but to a point, if the text 
appears to have too much white space, it can be subject to scrutiny. While this form 
of steganography can work effectively, it has a few big drawbacks. First, if the docu- 
ment is digital, any modern word processor would be able to show the spacing 
irregularities or, worse, reformat the document and destroy the hidden information. 
The other drawback is that this method doesn't transmit a large amount of informa- 
tion easily, which can limit its practicality. 
Color Palettes 
Some tools have characteristics that are unique among stego-tools. In some 
steganography programs the color palettes have unique characteristics that don't 
appear anywhere else. For example, the program Hide and Seek creates color palette 
entries that are divisible by 4 for all bit values. The palette modification creates a 
detectable steganography signature. 
Attack Types 
It is usually easier to destroy than to create, and in the case of attacking stegano- 
graphic files, this remains true. Since steganography is for the most part relatively 
fragile, a number of methods exist for attacking stegged files or suspected stegged 
files. A couple of these may actually yield the hidden message after considerable 
work, but most simply destroy the message, making its recovery by anyone impos- 
sible. 
Stego Only Attack 
The stego only attack is one where we only have the stego-medium, and we want to 
detect and/or extract the embedded message. 
Known Cover Attack 
The known cover attack is used when we have both the stego-medium and the 
cover medium, so we can make comparisons between the two. 
Known Message Attack 
The known message attack assumes we know the message and the stego-medium, 
and that we want to find the method used for embedding the message. 
www.syngress.com 

334 
Chapter 10 9 What Is Steganography? 
Chosen Stego Attack 
The chosen stego attack is used when we have both the stego-medium and the 
steganography tool or algorithm. 
Chosen Message Attack 
The chosen message attack is one where the steganalyst generates a stego-medium 
from a message using some particular tool, and looks for signatures that will enable 
the detection of other stego-media. 
Disabling or Active Attacks 
Blur 
Smoothes transitions and decreases contrast by averaging the pixels next to the hard 
edges of defined lines and areas where there are significant color transitions. 
Noise 
Random noise inserts random colored pixels to an image, while uniform noise 
inserts pixels and colors that closely resemble the original pixels. 
Noise Reduction 
Reduces noise in the image by adjusting the colors and averaging pixel values. 
Sharpen 
Sharpening is the opposite of blur. It increases contrast between adjacent pixels 
where there are significant color contrasts, usually at the edge of objects. 
Rotate 
Rotation moves an image around its center point in a given plane. 
Resample 
Resampling involves an interpolation process to minimize the "raggedness" normally 
associated with expanding an image. 
Soften 
Soften applies a uniform blur to an image to smooth edges and reduce contrasts. It 
causes less distortion than blurring.

Summary 
The first, and best, strategy is to stay educated. As everyone reading this knows, vol- 
umes of information about almost every variant of steganography are just a few 
Google searches away. And the information contained in this chapter should give 
you the ability to ask some very specific questions depending on your needs at the 
time. 
With the continuing increase in computing power, data storage, and the increase 
in the size and complexity of the files themselves, the ability for greater payloads will 
increase as well. I suspect this will make steganography even more difficult to detect 
as time goes on since there is nothing to say that the payload size has to increase 
along with the file size. For example, let's say I wanted to send a stegged message in 
an image to a friend via e-mail five years ago through Yahoo! or Hotmail. With the 
most basic of tools, I could have embedded a few kilobytes worth of ASCII text data 
into a 1MB JPEG and e-mailed it with no problems. Today, I could take those same 
few kilobytes of text and embed them in a 10MB JPEG, or MPEG, or MP3. My 
point is this, with the commonplace high-speed bandwidth and the natural progres- 
sion of increasing file sizes, along with the ability to move them across the Internet, 
this will give someone wishing to use steganography much larger cover mediums to 
choose from, without necessarily having to increase the size of the hidden message; 
thus, making detection just that much more difficult. 
Steganography in digital form is not a young technology anymore, and I suspect 
it will continue to increase in importance in the security community as time goes 
on. Since I still don't have that crystal ball I've been wanting, I can at least offer you 
some guidelines on being as prepared as possible regarding upcoming changes. 
1. Again, keep yourself informed. 
2. 
If you have to create a defensive strategy, consider the time factor; 80 per- 
cent today is better than 100 percent tomorrow. 
3. 
Apply offensive weaponry in defensive ways. Be creative; your adversaries 
will be. 
4. 
Keep the community informed if you discover a new threat. 
5. 
Do not consider any form of protection you might want to add as too 
extreme. It is },our network and information, after all.

Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Introduction 
I was sitting at my desk when my phone rang. I answered the phone and it was a 
large pharmaceutical company who was interested in consulting services. They 
started off the conversation stating that they had some problems and thought that 
my company might be able to help. They had noticed a trend with one of their for- 
eign competitors. Every time they went to release a new product (in this case a new 
drug), one of their competitors would release a similar drug with a similar name sev- 
eral weeks before them and would beat them to market. If you understand the drug 
industry, you'll know that this is a serious problem. The first company to get a 
product to market usually is able to obtain a higher market share and higher demand 
than its competitors. Therefore, this represented a huge monetary loss to the com- 
pany and the executives were concerned. 
This initially sounded like a potential problem but I needed more details. My 
follow-up question was how often had this occurred and over what time period. The 
executive I was talking with said it had happened eight times over the prior 12 
months. I was sitting there thinking:You think there is a problem? My next question 
was, "Why did you wait so long to call someone?" Their answer was, "We figured it 
was just a coincidence, because the only way this could have happened was if an 
insider was giving the information to a competitor and we trust all of the employees 
so this could not be the case." Over the next several months they were going to 
realize how wrong that previous statement was. 
I led an internal assessment team and over the course of several months found 
three different groups of people (each consisting of 2-4 people), working for two 
different competitors. Actually, one group was working for a foreign competitor and 
the other two groups were working for a foreign government. 
The fact that this story is true is scary, but what makes it even more troubling is 
that this happened more than 18 months ago and I have worked on and am aware of 
at least 15 other similar cases. The average monetary loss of the case I worked on was 
estimated at $350 million annually. 
The Devil Inside 
"I trust everyone, it is the devil inside that I do not trust," is a great line from the 
movie The Italian dob. Everyone has the potential do to harm, including your 
employees. If you look at the minimal background checks that most companies per- 
form on their employees, you have to wonder what that trust is based on. Why is it 
that once a total stranger is hired at your company, you now completely trust that 
person? Just because they are now called an employee does not mean they have loy- 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
339 
alty to your organization and would do nothing to hurt the company. We do not 
want you to be so paranoid that your company cannot function, but a healthy dose 
of paranoia is good. 
Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and other spies had one thing in common: they 
passed the polygraph (lie detector test) with almost a perfect score. How could a 
machine that tests whether people are lying not catch the biggest liars that cost so 
many people their lives? The reason is a polygraph does not detect lies, it detects 
guilt. In these cases, either the people felt justified by their actions and did not feel 
guilty about them or they were trained to be able to bypass and deceive people. 
Only by closely watching people over time will you start to understand that there 
are certain people who cannot be trusted. 
Insider threat and corporate espionage rely on the fact that it is sometimes better 
to live in denial and be happy than to know the truth and have to deal with it. One 
of my associates recently found out his wife was cheating on him and was very 
annoyed with the person who told him. The person who told him said, "Why are 
you mad at me? Didn't you want to know?" And the person's response was, "No." It 
was easier to live with a lie than deal with the truth. While most executives might 
not be bold enough to admit this, it is very true in corporations and governments 
around the world. It is easier to trust your employees and keep life simple, than to 
suspect everyone and deal with the complexities it creates. However, if it will put 
your company out of business, cause hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of loss, or 
cause people to die, you might think differently about the answer. 
Nobody wants to believe the truth, but corporate espionage via the insider 
threat is causing huge problems. Many companies either do not have the proper 
monitoring to realize or do not want to admit that it is happening to them. For 
some reason, with many crimes, including insider threat, victims feel embarrassed 
and ashamed. They are the victims, they did nothing wrong, but for some reason 
these criminals turn the tables on who is at fault. I have heard rape victims say that it 
was their own fault they were raped. I have also heard numerous times that it is a 
company's fault if they are stupid enough to be a victim to insider threat. With that 
mentality, who is going to admit that this happened to their company? The only 
person at fault is the attacker~not the victim. 
The Importance of Insider Threat 
Organizations tend to think that once they hire an employee or a contractor that 
that person is now part of a trusted group of people. Although an organization 
might give an employee additional access that an ordinary person would not have, 
why should they trust that person? Many organizations perform no background 

340 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
checks and no reference checks and as long as the hiring manager likes them, they 
will hire them. Many people might not be who you think they are and not properly 
validating them can be an expensive, if not a fatal, mistake. Because many organiza- 
tions, in essence, hire complete strangers who are really unknown entities and give 
them access to sensitive data, the insider threat is something that all organizations 
must worry about. 
If a competitor or similar entity wants to cause damage to your organization, 
steal critical secrets, or put you out of business, they just have to find a job opening, 
prep someone to ace the interview, have that person get hired, and they are in. The 
fact that it is that easy should scare you. Many companies have jobs open for several 
weeks and it could take a couple of weeks to set up an interview. That gives a com- 
petitor focused on your company a four-week period to prep someone to ace an 
interview. This is what foreign governments do when they plant a spy against the 
U.S. They know that a key criterion for that person is passing the polygraph, so they 
will put that person through intensive training so that he or she can pass the poly- 
graph with no problem. This points out a key disadvantage that organizations have. 
The attacker knows what process you are going to follow to hire someone and all 
they have to do is prep someone so they ace that part of the process. 
In terms of the importance, I often hear people say that it is only hype and that it 
cannot happen to us. This is synonymous to thinking that bad things only happen to 
others, they never happen to you; until they happen to you and then you have a dif- 
ferent view of the world. I remember several years ago when my father got diagnosed 
with having a cancerous brain tumor. It shocked me, devastated me, and changed my 
views forever. Prior to that I knew that people had brain cancer but it was something 
that I could not relate to or understand because I never thought it could really 
happen to me or someone I love. Bad things happened to others, not to me. This is 
the denial that many of us live in, but the unfortunate truth is bad things do happen 
and they could be occurring right now and you just do not know about it. 
Insider threat is occurring all the time, but since it is happening within a com- 
pany, it is a private attack. Public attacks like defacing a Web site are hard for a com- 
pany to deny. Private attacks are much easier to conceal. 
Because these attacks are being perpetrated by trusted insiders, you need to 
understand the damage they can cause; how to build proper measures to prevent the 
attack; how to minimize the damage; and, at a minimum, how to detect the attacks 
in a timely manner. Many of the measures companies deploy today are ineffective 
against the insider. When companies talk about security and securing their enter- 
prise, they are concerned with the external attack, forgetting about the damage that 
an insider can cause. Many people debate about what percent of attacks come from 
insiders and what percent of attacks come from outsiders. The short answer is who 
www.syngress.com 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
341 
cares? The real answer is this: 
9 
Can attacks come from external sources? 
9 
Can an external attack cause damage to your company? 
9 
Can an external attack put you out of business? 
9 
Can attacks come from internal sources? 
9 
Can an internal attack cause damage to your company? 
9 
Can an internal attack put you out of business? 
Since the answer to all of these questions is YES, who cares what the percent is? 
Both have to be addressed and both have to be dealt with. I would argue that since 
the insider has access already, the amount of damage they can cause is much greater 
than an external attacker and the chances of getting caught are much lower. If an 
attacker comes in from the outside, he has access only to systems that are publicly 
accessible and he has to break through security devices. If an attacker comes from 
the inside, she has full access and minimal if any security devices to deal with.As our 
digital economy continues to grow and the stakes increase, anyone who wants 
serious access to an organization is not even going to waste his time with an 
external attack, he is going to go right for the trusted insider. 
Finally, to highlight the importance of insider threat, everyone is getting on the 
bandwagon. The Unites States Secret Service is conducting a series of studies on the 
insider; conferences are popping up on the subject. Why? Because billions of dollars 
are being lost and something has to be done to stop the bleeding.You will never be 
able to completely remove the insider threat because companies need to be able to 
function. If you fire all your employees, you might have prevented the insider attack, 
but you will also go out of business. The key is to strike a balance between what 
access people need and what access people have. 
Insider Threat Defined 
Since everyone uses different terminology, it is important to define what we mean 
by insider threat. The easiest way to get a base definition is to break the two words 
apart. According to www.dictionary.com, insider is defined as "one who has special 
knowledge or access to confidential information" and threat is defined as "an expres- 
sion of an intention to inflict pain, injury, evil, or punishment; an indication of 
impending danger or harm; or one that is regarded as a possible danger." Putting this 
together, an insider threat is anyone who has special access or knowledge with the 
intent to cause harm or danger. 
www.syngress.com 

342 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
There is a reason that the insider threat is so powerful and most companies are 
not aware of it; it is because all the standard security devices that organizations 
deploy do little if anything to prevent the insider threat. 
However, as much as we do not want to admit it, this is no longer true (if it ever 
was). The problem with insider threat is that it takes only one person who is dis- 
gruntled and looking for a quick payoff or revenge and your company is compro- 
mised. Unfortunately, it is really that easy and one of the many reasons that the 
problem has gotten so out of hand. 
The world is also a different place than it once was. Most people today, by the 
time they are at the age of 30, have had more jobs than both their parents combined 
across their entire careers. In the past, people worked for one company for 30 years 
and retired. Having worked for one company for an entire career builds loyalty. 
However, today people switch companies fairly often and while most people are not 
intentionally out to perform corporate espionage, there is a high chance they can 
inadvertently perform it. When you switch companies, you most likely are going to 
stay within the same industry, unless you are making a complete career change, 
which is unlikely. Therefore, the chance that you are going to work for a competitor 
is very high. This means some of your knowledge from your previous employer, 
despite your best efforts, will leak over into this new company. 
People do not like to hear it and employers do not like to admit it, but the 
biggest threat to a company is their internal employees.Your employees or anyone 
with special access (like a contractor) have more access than an outsider and therefore 
can cause a lot more damage. However, most organizations and media still focus on 
the external threat and pay little attention to the insider threat. Why? The short 
answer is the external threat is easier to see and easier to defend against. If an external 
attacker defaces your Web site, it is easy to detect and defend against. It is also difficult 
to deny because everyone can tell that it happened. However, if an employee makes 
copies of all of the customer credit cards and walks out with it on a USB drive that 
fits in his or her wallet, it is very difficult to detect and defend against. 
Authorized versus Unauthorized Insider 
An insider is anyone with special or additional access and an insider attack is 
someone using that access against the company in some way. The key question to ask 
is why does that person have the access they have and how did they get that access? 
One of the best ways to defend against the insider threat is to institute a principle of 
least privilege. Principle of least privilege states that you give an entity the least 
amount of access they need to do their job. There are two key pieces to this. First, 
you are giving your employees additional access. For employees to be able to per- 
www.syngress.com 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
343 
form their job at a company, it is obvious that they will need to be given special 
access that a normal person does not have. This means that every employee, con- 
tractor, or anyone else performing work at your organization has the potential to 
cause harm. The second key piece is needed to do their job. This focuses in on how 
critical access is to an organization.You know that every employee is going to be 
given special access; you just want to limit and control that access to the minimum 
possible subset. 
The problem with most organizations is that employees are given a lot more 
access than what they actually need to do their jobs. Although the risk of insider 
threat is present with every employee, giving them additional access just increases the 
damage and increases the number of people that could cause harm. If only five 
people out of 3000 have access to a sensitive database within your organization, one 
of those five people would have to be motivated for an insider threat problem to 
arise. However, if 300 out of 3000 people have access to that information, the odds 
of finding or motivating someone is much higher. Therefore, the more people that 
have access to a piece of information, the greater the chance it could cause harm to 
your organization. 
In addition, the more access that a single person has, the greater the damage that 
person can cause. If 10 different managers each have access to only 10 different pieces 
of sensitive data, for all 10 pieces of data to be compromised, 10 people would have 
to be involved. However, if one person had access to all 10 pieces of data, then it 
would take only one person to cause a grave amount of damage to the organization. 
Based on this analysis, two criteria are critical for analyzing the potential for 
insider threat: number of people with access to a piece of information and number 
of pieces of data a single individual has. Carefully tracking and controlling critical 
data and people with critical access can minimize the potential for insider threat. 
We have clearly shown that access is the avenue in which insider threat is mani- 
fested. The question is how did they get that access? If they were given the access 
then they are authorized to access the information. If they were not given the access, 
but stole, borrowed, or acquired it without permission, then it is unauthorized 
access. The reason the distinction is important is that it helps determine the counter- 
measures that could be put in place. Security devices like firewalls, passwords, and 
encryption protect against unauthorized access. If an unprotected wireless access 
point is set up, people who are unauthorized to connect to the corporate network 
can still connect and access sensitive data. Someone who is unauthorized to access 
the file server can walk up to an unlocked computer and access sensitive data. 
However, if proper security is put in place with firewalls, encryption, and passwords, 
an unauthorized person should no longer be able to connect to an unprotected

Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
wireless access point or to sit down in front of an unlocked system. So the security 
measures that are present today can prevent unauthorized insider threat. 
However, all the current security measures today will not prevent the authorized 
insider.You can set up all the security you want on a network, but that will not stop 
someone with proper authorization. An authorized insider is someone with a valid 
reason for accessing the data but who uses that access in a way that was not intended 
by the company. The NOC manager is given access to customer passwords, because 
he needs that access to do his job. However, it is very hard to stop him from giving 
that information to an attacker or a competitor. When talking about authorized 
insider threat, intent plays a key role. People need access to do their jobs, but what 
are their intentions once they get access? Luckily, as the case studies in the later 
chapters will demonstrate, negative intentions rarely go without warning. 
Categories of Insider Threat 
Depending on the levels of access someone has, there are different categories of 
insider: 
9 
Pure insider 
9 
Insider associate 
9 
Insider affiliate 
9 
Outside affiliate 
Each type has different levels of access and different motives. 
Pure Insider 
A pure insider is an employee with all the rights and access associated with being 
employed by the company. Typically, they have keys or a badge to get access to the 
facility, a logon to get access to the network, and can walk around the building 
unescorted. They can cause the most damage because they already have most of the 
access they need. 
Elevated pure insider is an insider who has additional privileged access. This usu- 
ally includes system administrators who have root or administrator access on the net- 
work. These people were given the additional access to do their jobs; however, in 
many cases, they are given more access than what they need. Very often when com- 
panies try to mitigate the risk of an insider threat, the best area to focus on is lim- 
iting the access of the elevated pure insider. This is also called the "principle of least 
privilege," or giving someone the least amount of access they need to do their job. 
Notice the key factors in this definition: you are not stopping people from doing 
their jobs; you are just taking away the extra access that they do not need. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
345 
With the pure insider, the key areas to focus in on to detect or prevent damage 
are access, behavior, and money. Throughout this book you will see that an under- 
lying factor of insider threat is access. If someone does not have proper access, it 
makes their job much harder. Limiting and controlling access is key. 
The second factor that comes into play is behavior. In many cases, when 
someone commits an insider attack, there have usually been personal behavior pat- 
terns that were predictive of such behavior. Usually they openly talked bad about the 
company or management. They tended to be unhappy and angry at work and might 
even have stated that one of these days they were going to get back at the company. 
A third driving factor with the pure insider is money. Many of the people who 
perform these attacks have financial issues. A normal employee would not commit 
insider threat. However, if you add in stress and financial issues and someone comes 
along and offers a large sum of money to make all of their problems go away, there is 
a chance that person might be tempted. Therefore, tying this in with the second 
point, good managers should understand and watch for unusual behavior patterns. If 
a certain employee is complaining about financial issues and child support and three 
months later is driving a new Lexus, you might want to be concerned. 
Insider Associate 
Insider associates are people who have limited authorized access. Contractors, guards, 
and cleaning and plant services all fit under this category. They are not employees of 
the company and do not need full access, but they need limited access. Limited 
access usually takes the form of having physical access to the facility but not access 
to the network. This is best illustrated by a scene in the movie Wall Street. Charlie 
Sheen needed access to stock trading information. The easiest way he found to 
obtain it was to get a job at the company that provided the janitorial services for the 
company who he needed information on. He was given access to all of the offices 
after hours and as he was cleaning the offices he looked at and made copies of sensi- 
tive information that was left on people's desks. We tend to forget that in an office 
building, locking a door really does little to protect the security of the information 
in your office. With one company I worked for, everyone left sensitive data on their 
desks and locked their doors. The problem was that a master key was kept in a cen- 
tral location that anyone could use to gain access to an office. We have to remember 
that there are other people who can gain access to our offices and therefore sensitive 
data must always be properly secured. 
To minimize the damage an insider associate can cause requires user awareness 
and controlling access. Raising awareness is meant to change someone's behavior as 
compared to training that is meant to teach someone a new skill. Many employees 
www.syngress.com 

346 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
feel that their building, floor, and office are properly secure and leave systems logged 
in and information out that they shouldn't. User-awareness sessions can help change 
behaviors patterns, as people understand that locks do little to protect information. 
They must understand that a lot of people have potential access and that they should 
always properly secure sensitive data and lock systems before they walk away from 
them. In addition, you should carefully examine any activity that requires access to a 
facility. For example, why does the cleaning staff need access to everyone's office 
every night? I recommend that the cleaning staff not have a master key to each 
office. Instead, when people leave at the end of the day, they can put their trash can 
in the hallway. If they want their office vacuumed, they can leave their door open; if 
they do not want someone to have access, they can lock it. If employees leave their 
doors open, they know others can gain access and therefore will make sure that all 
sensitive date is properly secured. 
Insider Afjiliate 
Pure insiders and insider associates have a legitimate reason to access the building. 
The next two categories of insider do not. An insider affiliate is a spouse, friend, or 
even client of an employee who uses the employee's credentials to gain access. This 
can be as simple as a friend coming to visit you, so you get them a badge for the 
building. When you take a phone call they go to use the rest room and on the way 
back they wander around looking at what is on people's computers and on their 
desks. While this can cause some problems it can usually be controlled. 
The more damaging insider affiliate is someone who directly acts as an employee 
using the employee's credentials. The most common is remote access.Your spouse 
wants to sit on the couch and surf the Web and wants to borrow your laptop.You 
give him your user ID and password so he can log on and access the Internet. But 
what else is he accessing either deliberately or on purpose? I have also seen cases 
where a spouse is running out for the day and hands over his access card for the 
building and PIN number and says, "Can you swing by the office and pick up a few 
papers for me?" Once again, people think this is harmless, but if you stop and think 
about it, you'll realize the results can be very damaging. 
To prevent insider affiliates, the best measure is to implement policies and proce- 
dures.You should never take for granted that employees will do the right thing. I 
have seen people say, "Well, of course everyone should know that they should not let 
someone borrow their user ID and password." But then I see others saying, "Why 
can't I, I am not doing any harm and I did not know that I wasn't suppose to." 
The short answer is to never make assumptions.You should have clearly written 
policies and procedures, explain them to all employees, and require that they sign off 
www.syngress.com 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
347 
that they understand them. Then, any deviation from the policy can 
deliberate action on the part of an employee. 
be taken as a 
Outside Affiliate 
Outside affiliates are non-trusted outsiders who use open access to gain access to an 
organization's resources. Today, one of" the best examples is wireless access. If a com- 
pany sets up an unprotected wireless access point, what stops an outsider from con- 
necting? Nothing. Therefore, if an outsider is sitting at a Starbucks across from your 
office building and connects to your wireless network, are they breaking into your 
network? No.You are leaving the door wide open and they are wandering in. This is 
the same as leaving the front door unlocked with no access controls or guards, 
allowing anyone to walk in off the street. 
Although the outside affiliate seems obvious, it is often overlooked by many 
companies. Protecting against the outside affiliate requires proper access controls in 
place for all types of access, including virtual and physical access. 
Key Aspects of Insider Threat 
The key thing to remember when dealing with insiders is that they have access and 
in most cases will exploit the weakest link that gives them the greatest chance of 
access, while minimizing the chances that they get caught. Why try to break through 
a firewall and gain access to a system with a private address, when you can find 
someone behind the firewall with full access to the system? I know it has been 
emphasized many times, but taking advantage of access is a driving force in the 
insider attack. 
Most people, when they think of attackers, think of someone with a huge 
amount of technical sophistication that can walk through virtual cyber walls and 
gain access to anything that they want. However, insiders take advantage of the fact 
that they already have access, so many of the attack methods tend to be very low in 
technical sophistication. In some cases, if a pure insider or insider associate has partial 
access, they will sometimes use additional techniques to increase their access. 
However, since they are typically not dealing with any security devices, most of the 
methods tend to be fairly straightforward. 
It is also important to remember that to launch an effective attack, attackers need 
knowledge of the organization they are trying to attack. External attackers could 
spend weeks, if not longer, trying to acquire the information they need to launch a 
successful attack. In some cases, if they cannot gain enough knowledge, they might 
decide to go against a different target. However, in the case of the insider, they have 
full knowledge of your operations. They know what is checked and what is not 
www.syngress.com 

348 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
checked and can even test the system. For example, when they are trying to access 
their private shares, they could click on someone else's and see if anyone says any- 
thing. If they do this multiple times and nothing ever happens, they have now gained 
valuable knowledge that either access information is not being logged or not being 
watched. Because they have access to the operations, they either have detailed 
knowledge of how things operate or they can gain it quickly by testing the system. 
J 
~ 
A private share is a folder on a file server that is only accessible by that indi- 
~ 
viduai and meant to hold personal or sensitive information. For example at 
!i{!i!i~ii most companies each person has his or her own private share to store files. 
Acceptable Level of Loss 
Everyone has heard the phrase no pain no gain or no risk no reward. Every com- 
pany in business has to take some level of risk; otherwise, the company will not be 
able to survive. If you say that your company will have no risk of insider threat, then 
do not hire any employees. However, the second you hire one employee your 
chances of having an insider attack increase; as you hire more employees the risk 
keeps increasing. From a naive standpoint, you might ask, if your risk keeps 
increasing why would you keep hiring people? The short answer is so that the com- 
pany can grow and revenues and profits can increase and most companies are willing 
to take that risk. 
This is also true of external attacks. As soon as you provide e-mail and Web ser- 
vices to the Internet, your chances of being attacked from the outside increase. 
However, your level of service and revenues also increase so it is a risk worth taking. 
The bottom line is you have to figure out what your acceptable level of loss is 
and then build in proper measures to protect against it. Many companies do not do 
this, throw caution to the wind, lose large amounts of money, and potentially go out 
of business due to insider attacks. It is much better to realize that there will be some 
level of loss but build in measures to minimize it to an acceptable level. 
For example, hiring and giving everyone administrator access would be a huge 
potential for loss and not one that I would be willing to accept. On the other hand, 
if you require that anyone needing administrator access has to justify why they need 
it, get sign off by two executives, and go through a series of additional background 
checks before he or she is given the access, this will help reduce the risk.You might 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
349 
also put measures in place to rotate out key positions so it would be harder for a 
person to cause damage over a long period of time. In the chapters that follow, you 
will see how rotation in particular could have drastically shortened damage in many 
insider threat cases, such as when Mel Spillman stole nearly five million dollars over 
15 years. In addition, you might set up separation of duties in which two people are 
required to perform a certain function, which prevents a single person from causing 
damage. This could have been monumental in reducing some of the visa fraud cases 
we will discuss, such as when Hsin Hui Hsu sent fraudulent letters inviting poten- 
tially hundreds of unauthorized Chinese nationals into the United States for "discus- 
sions" that were never meant to take place. 
None of these measures mentioned would stop a determined attacker, but they 
enable you to properly manage risk to an acceptable level. 
Insider attacks are likely to occur against your organization; the questions is 
whether you will be able to prevent most of them and in cases where you cannot 
prevent them, can you detect them in a timely manner? 
Prevention versus Detection 
One saying that I use a lot is, "Prevention is ideal but detection is a must."You 
always try to prevent attacks as much as possible and in cases where you cannot pre- 
vent an attack, you try to detect it in a timely manner and minimize the damage. 
The problem with insider threat is that prevention does not scale very well. If 
someone wants to compromise a piece of data he is going to do it. Therefore, while 
prevention measures should be put in place, they must always be teamed with detec- 
tive measures.You have to assume that someone with inside knowledge and access 
will be able to work around the prevention measures; the key is, can you detect 
them and then take follow-up action to control the damage? 
When I work with many companies on insider threat, they tell me that they 
want to put measures in place to detect attackers, not prevent them. Their logic is: if 
we prevent someone from doing something, they will just get more sophisticated 
and those more-sophisticated measures we might not know about. On the other 
hand, if we detect that someone is doing something, we have the proof and can take 
follow-up action to stop them by prosecuting or taking other measures against them. 
In reality, what we are striving for is covert detection with reactive prevention. 
The reason this is the case is that there is so much going on in a network it is very 
difficult to find the malicious behavior. Many people say it is like finding a needle in 
a haystack. I think it is a lot worse than that and is like finding a single grain of sand 
among all the beaches in the world.

350 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
The problem with insider threat is finding enough information or having a 
high-enough level of confidence to know that someone is committing an insider 
attack. Most of us would agree that if we are 99 percent sure that someone is com- 
mitting an insider attack, we would take action against them; if we were one percent 
sure, we would not take action. It is always easy to define the extremes, but what 
about the area in the middle that is gray? What is the burden of proof for your orga- 
nization in which you have enough information to take action? 
I want you to re-read the preceding paragraph. At first you might wonder what 
it has to do with prevention versus detection, but as you read it closely, you'll see it 
is talking about behavior: having enough indication that someone is up to no good. 
To gain the proper level of confidence, you must gather information, which is a cat- 
egory of detection. With detective measures you are monitoring and gathering 
information; when you have enough data points, you take action. 
I am not saying that prevention should never be used against insider threats; I am 
just saying that you need a fine balance between prevention and detection. 
Preventive measures will stop a basic insider, which is what you want. A low-grade 
attacker you just want to stop and make go away, they are not worth additional 
effort. However, when it comes to high-end attackers who will put in whatever 
measure is necessary to accomplish a task, prevention will not stop them. It will just 
cause them to dig deeper and make it harder for you to find them the next time 
they come back. In these cases, detective measures will be key for finding and stop- 
ping them. 
The bottom line is, to stop the insider threat problem, an organization has to put 
together a comprehensive and integrated solution of preventive and detective mea- 
sures that encompass both host- and network-based solutions. 
Insider versus External Threat 
Arguing over whether insider versus external threat causes the most damage is what 
I categorize across the industry as a holy war. A holy war is a situation where you 
have smart people on both sides who disagree and the disagreement has gone on for 
so long that a stalemate has occurred. Regardless what the other side says, the group 
in disagreement will not listen. This is a no-win situation. The short answer that I 
stated previously in this chapter is: they both can cause damage and they both have 
to be addressed. 
The problem to date is that most security efforts and focus have been on the 
external threat. At most organizations more energy and effort have been put against 
the external threat than the internal threat. The reason is simple" it is easier to stop, 
easier to control, and more visible. If you have system x you can state that it should 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
351 
not be accessible from the Internet and put measures in place to prevent it. Then if 
someone accesses it externally, it sets off a flag. The problem with the insider threat is, 
people are suppose to access server x but only for legitimate purposes. Now you have 
to measure intent when someone accesses data, which is almost impossible to do. 
In addition, the outsider threat is more understood. We understand the means 
and methods and exploit scripts that are utilized to attack systems because we have a 
lot of case study. With insider threat we know it is occurring and it is damaging, but 
we have less factual data to base conclusions on. 
Companies that are going to survive and thrive in the coming century are going 
to have to turn their focus to the insider and take action against these types of 
threats. Otherwise, by the time they do, there will not be much of their company left 
to save. 
Why the Insider 
Threat Has Been Ignored 
At this point you might be saying that if the insider threat is so damaging, why has it 
been ignored and why haven't people been focusing on it early? There are many rea- 
sons for this. First, it is not an easy problem. It is very hard to understand and almost 
impossible to get your arms around. Both the CIA and FBI knew of the damages of 
insider threat and took many measures to prevent it. However, over the past ten years 
they have still been severely impacted by it. 
There are three key reasons that the insider threat has been ignored: 
9 
Organizations do not know it is happening. 
9 
It is easy to be in denial. 
9 
Organizations fear bad publicity. 
Each of these three areas will be examined in the following sections. 
Organizations Do Not Know It Is Happening 
Many companies do not even realize it is happening to them. Companies have good 
quarters and they have bad quarters; they have times where revenue is high and they 
have times when revenue is low. When the bad times occur, there are usually reason- 
able explanations for them. If a company had poor earnings in a given quarter because 
a new product they released did not do as well as they thought because a competitor 
came out with a similar product two months earlier, it is easy to write this off to poor

352 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
market analysis. Because insider threat is a relatively new area for companies, their first 
thought is not going to be that it was because of an insider attack. 
As insiders keep increasing in sophistication, it is going to be harder and harder 
for companies to know it is happening to them and are going to find other explana- 
tions for why the damage occurred. 
We are not trying to turn companies into Chicken Little, where they run around 
saying the sky is falling, but we are trying to raise companies' awareness of what is 
happening and potentially give them an alternative explanation to what is happening 
when none of the conventional explanations seem to make sense. It is a hard 
problem and difficult to investigate, but the key thing to remember is: it will not go 
away. If you ignore it, it will only get worse. Therefore, if you think there is the 
potential that your organization is the victim of" an insider attack, the sooner you 
start working the problem, the easier it will be and the less energy you will have to 
put in down the road. Insider threat is like a fire. The sooner you can detect a fire, 
the easier it is to deal with it. Ignoring a fire will not cause it to go out; it will keep 
getting worse and worse over time. 
I would argue that if your company has been in existence for a while and has 
employees, the internal attack is occurring at some level. It might be a frustrated 
employee deleting some files, or someone bringing supplies home for the children, 
or people leaving sensitive documents at another location. While these might not 
seem damaging, think of the fire example. Do you want to put the fire out now 
while it is small or wait until it becomes a big problem? 
It Is Easy to Be in Denial 
After you admit you have a problem, you have to deal with it. One of my friends 
had a drinking problem and he would never admit to it. Everyone around him kept 
saying that they do not understand how he cannot recognize he has this problem. It 
turned out that it was twofold. First, he always justified it in his mind and down- 
played it so he thought it was not as bad as it really was. Second, he knew that once 
he admitted he had a problem, he would have to do something about it, which he 
did not want to do. 
These things are true with any problem that a company or person faces. It is 
sometimes easier to live in denial than. to accept the truth and have to deal with it. 
Also, some companies write it off saying that they are willing to accept a certain 
level of loss to insider threat. That would be okay if they could answer these two 
questions: How much are you losing to insider threat? And what is your level of tol- 
erance? If companies knew the answers to these questions and could live with them, 
www.syngress.com 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
353 
that would be acceptable. The problem is that most companies have no idea how 
much money they are losing. 
When it comes to insider threat, you are going to have to pay now or pay later 
and the sooner you pay, the less you will have to pay. While it is easier to live in 
denial for a short period of time, it is easier to identify and deal with the problem 
now than allow it to grow worse over time. 
Fear of Bad Publicity 
In some cases, companies are acknowledging they have a problem and dealing with 
it but not telling anyone because of the fear of bad publicity. 
If a financial institution had three large clients compromised because of an insider 
attack and they publicly announced it, how many other clients would change banks 
because they fear that it could happen to them? The funny thing is a bank admitting 
they had a problem and fixed it is more secure than a bank who claims they never had 
any problems. However, when it comes to bad publicity, logic does not always hold up. 
Therefore, many places would rather keep their dirty secrets inside than expose them 
to the public. The real question that most executives ask is: what benefit or good will 
come of publicly announcing we had a problem? Except for raising awareness across 
the industry, little direct benefit will come to the company. 
Why the Insider Threat Is 
Worse Than the External Threat 
We have talked about the difference between the insider and external threat and 
why the insider threat has been ignored. In this section we are going to look at why 
the insider threat is potentially worse and what action must be taken to prevent and 
detect these types of attacks. 
Although any type of attack can cause damage, the insider threat is usually worse 
for the following reasons: 
9 
It's easier to implement. 
9 
Current solutions do not scale. 
9 
There's a high chance of success. 
9 
There's less chance of being caught. 
r

Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Easier 
In many cases the insider attack is fairly easy because the person committing the act 
either has all or most of the access she needs. In addition, she has the knowledge to 
pull off the attack with less chance of being caught. A person committing an 
external attack has no idea what is going on at the other end. Fifteen people could 
be watching and ready to take legal action against him or they could be ignoring 
him. He could be very close to success or very far from it. He receives little knowl- 
edge and information and because the details of the site he is attacking are 
unknown, he is executing a blind attack, which is very difficult. 
While some inside attacks are sophisticated, many of them are very straightfor- 
ward because the attacker has the knowledge and access needed to commit the 
attack in a seamless manner. 
Current Solutions Do Not Scale 
Most security devices that are deployed at organizations are meant to stop the external 
attack. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems 
(IPS) are based off some attack vector that they are trying to prevent. Firewalls block 
access to certain ports, which stops an attacker but does not stop an insider. If an 
insider needs access to certain information to do his job, a firewall will allow it. If that 
person uploads data to an external site or e-mails it to an unauthorized party, it is 
almost impossible for a firewall to prevent. IDS and IPS work off known signatures of 
attack. Most external attacks have known signatures, most internal attacks do not. In 
addition, most security devices are deployed at the perimeter. Once you get past the 
perimeter there are minimal internal protection measures. 
As we have talked about, limiting access and implementing policies and proce- 
dures are key to preventing the insider threat. It should not be surprising that most 
organizations do a terrible job at controlling access and an even worse job at having 
clear, consistent policies. While companies claim they are doing this, they are not 
doing a good job. The analogy I like to use with security policies is that of sex when 
I went to high school. When I was in high school, everyone talked about sex and 
said they were having sex, but in reality, very few people were having sex and those 
that were having it were doing it incorrectly. Sorry for the bluntness, but that per- 
fectly describes the state of security policies today. 
Security measures that are in place are mainly for the perimeter and do not scale 
to the insider. Measures that will protect against the insider are hard to implement at 
a large organization and do not scale very well. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
355 
High Chance of Success 
If someone gives you all the details and gives you the access you need, success is 
almost guaranteed. Now, I want to be careful not to over hype how easy the insider 
threat is, but I would at least argue that it is going to be easier than the external 
threat. One of the reasons there are more case studies on external threat in this book 
is because more people get caught. Particularly in the chapter on commercial threats 
you will notice that more than half the insiders were caught when the competing 
company they offered their proprietary information to contacted the authorities. 
What about the companies that are not so honest and ethical? How many other 
cases are out there that we are not aware of?. The more people that get caught, the 
better you can understand a given problem. 
Even if companies have proper access control in place and solid policies, the 
insider threat will be easier than the external threat for the foreseeable future. 
Less Chance of Being Caught 
If you know the environment and have access, you are technically not breaking in. If 
you are not breaking in, the chances of being caught are much lower. If an attacker 
has to maliciously compromise a firewall and use a zero-day exploit to break into a 
system and is doing things that are not suppose to be done, he has a higher chance 
of being detected. However, if he is accessing data that he is allowed to access but 
using it a manner that he is not supposed to, it is much harder for that action to be 
detected. 
The Effect of Insider 
Threats on a Company 
We have spent a lot of time laying the foundation for the insider threat and why an 
organization needs to be concerned with it. This section is where the rubber hits the 
road and we start to show how it can really impact your company and potentially 
put you out of business. It is one thing to know that the insider threat exists; it is 
completely different to see how it can affect your company's bottom line. 
The obvious types of insider activity focus on disgruntled employees and usually 
revolve around destroying data or modifying data to cause harm to an organization 
(sabotage). Although these attacks cause monetary loss, they usually are easy to detect 
after the fact because the insider wants to take credit for his actions. Based on that, 
these are usually one-time attacks, where once the attacker performs his actions, he 
either disappears or is caught.

Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Other types of attacks are more damaging because they are done for different 
reasons, mainly financial gain, and therefore are much harder to stop or detect. The 
first area is fraud. According to www.dictionary.com, fraud is defined as: 
"Deception carried out for the purpose of achieving personal gain while 
causing injury to another party. For example, selling a new security issue while 
intentionally concealing important facts related to the issue is fraud." 
Releasing false information to outsiders or intentionally misrepresenting a 
product internally, all fall under the category of fraud. The more knowledge that you 
have, the easier it is to present false information to obtain the desired results that you 
are after. 
One of the most damaging forms of insider threat is theft of intellectual prop- 
erty (IP). Although some companies do not recognize or admit to it, every organiza- 
tion that is in business has IP that must be protected. If this IP is compromised or 
given to the wrong person it could undermine the financial stability of the company. 
If a company understands, recognizes, and protects its IR it can still be compromised, 
but it will be much harder. What is devastating is situations were a large percent of 
internal employees have access to sensitive IE It only takes one person to cross the 
line and cause damage to the organization. In many cases, IP cases revolve around 
theft or breach of confidentiality of IE 
A twist on this is sabotage or modification of critical IE One way to damage a 
company is to take sensitive IP and give it to a competitor. Another method is to 
modify the IP so it does not work or causes harm, which would cause the company 
to discontinue the use of that IR which in some cases can be even more damaging. 
Would you rather have a viable product that has strong competition or no viable 
product regardless of the competition? 
Fraud, theft of IP, and sabotage can all lead to the following: 
Monetary loss to the organization 
9 
Financial instability 
9 
Decrease in competitive advantage 
9 
Loss of customers 
9 
Loss of consumer confidence 
There are many indicators that insider threat is happening at your company but 
companies have to be looking in the right area to see them. If your eyes are closed 
or you are looking the wrong direction, you might never realize that there is a 
problem.

What you have to remember is that insider attackers rarely think about the con- 
sequences of their actions or when they do, they obscure the facts to justify them in 
their minds. 
How Bad Is It 
Statistics on What Is Happening 
I can talk all day about the damage insider threat is causing companies and the cases 
that I have seen, but I thought it would be helpful to list some statistics across the 
industry and from recent reports. This section will show statistic, charts, and informa- 
tion from external sources, to validate the damage insider threat is causing across the 
world. 
Insider Threat Study 
The first set of findings is from a recent report titled "Insider Threat Study: Illicit 
Cyber Activity in the Banking and Finance Sector" that was written by the National 
Threat Assessment Center of the United States Secret Service and the CEP, T 
Coordination Center. The full report can be found at: www.sei.cmu.edu/ 
publications/documents/04.reports/04tr021/04tr021.html 
The following are some critical points from the study. Each conclusive point 
from the study will be listed followed by brief analysis: 
Conclusion 
In 87 percent of the cases studied, the insiders employed simple, legitimate user 
commands to carry out the incidents. Only a small number of cases required tech- 
nical knowledge of network security. For example, very few cases were carried out 
via a script or program (nine percent), and only slightly more involved spoofing or 
flooding (13 percent). There was no evidence that any insider scanned computer sys- 
tems to discover vulnerabilities prior to the incident. 
Analysis 
This report highlights that this is not a technical problem but predominately an 
access problem. For external threat it is mainly a technical problem that can be 
solved with security devices like firewalls, IPS, and IDS. The insider already has 
access and is just using the access they have in an unauthorized manner. 
www.syngress.com 

358 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Conclusion 
In 70 percent of cases studied, the insiders exploited or attempted to exploit systemic 
vulnerabilities in applications, processes, or procedures (for example, business rule 
checks, authorized overrides) to carry out the incidents. In 61 percent of the cases, 
the insiders exploited vulnerabilities inherent in the design of the hardware, software, 
or network. 
Analysis 
One of the big problems with insiders is that they have knowledge. External 
attackers cannot exploit something they do not know about. An insider knows your 
organization's deepest, darkest secrets and will utilize them to her advantage. A 
trusted insider might know about a security hole and purposely not fix it so she can 
use it to gain access later. She might also create security holes that no one else will 
find, so she can get back in later. In most organizations, if a security engineer or 
system administrator wanted to create a back door that no one else knew about and 
that was virtually undetectable, he could. The reason is that most organizations do 
not have enough people to implement full checks and balances and they trust that 
their employees and contractors will always do the right thing. 
Conclusion 
In 78 percent of the incidents, the insiders were authorized users with active com- 
puter accounts at the time of the incident. In 43 percent of the cases, the insider 
used his or her own username and password to carry out the incident. 
Analysis 
In most cases, insiders are not really breaking into a system. They are just taking 
advantage of access they already have. What is also interesting is that they are using 
their actual accounts, so they are not trying to hide anything. Either they know the 
organization's security is so bad that they are not even looking at the logs; they do 
not care if they get caught; or they are so unsophisticated about technology that they 
do not even realize that someone could be watching them. With regards to the first 
item, in most cases insiders will test the waters. They will try something minor and 
see if anyone notices. If no one notices they will be a little more aggressive. If after 
several times no one notices, they figure they are in the clear. This is typically how 
an insider is caught because over time they let their guard down and push the limits 
(they get greedy) and someone notices.

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
359 
Conclusion 
There were some cases in which the insider used other means beyond his or her 
user account to perpetrate the harm. Twenty-six percent of the cases involved the 
use of someone else's computer account, physical use of an unattended terminal with 
an open user account, or social engineering (that is, gaining access through manipu- 
lation of a person or persons who can permit or facilitate access to a system or data). 
Analysis 
When performing an insider attack, even if the company is fairly secure, the weakest 
link in any organization is the human link. One person leaving his terminal 
unlocked for one hour on one day when he goes to a meeting provides the oppor- 
tunity for an insider attack. In cases where an insider cannot find an unlocked ter- 
minal, she can usually obtain some level of access through social engineering 
attempts (just asking). 
Conclusion 
Only 23 percent of the insiders were employed in technical positions, with 17 per- 
cent of the insiders possessing system administrator or root access. 
Analysis 
This is no longer a revenge of the nerds situation. When insider threat is mentioned, 
most people think it is perpetrated by the technical staff. On the contrary, it can be 
anyone with a computer across your entire organization. Anyone who has access to 
the physical building that houses your organization has the potential to commit 
insider threat. This is why the problem is so difficult to detect and prevent: any one 
of your employees or contractors has the potential, means, and methods to cause 
harm. 
Conclusion 
Thirty-nine percent of the insiders were unaware of the organizations' technical 
security measures. 
Analysis 
This is one of my favorite statistics. A little less than half of the people committing 
insider threat did not know and did not care about any technical security measures 
that were in place. Reading deeper into this, the technical measures did nothing to 
www.syngress.com 

360 
Chapter 11 
9 Insider Threat 
detect or stop the attack. Reading even deeper, the reason technical measures were 
ineffective is because almost 40 percent of the attacks were non-technical. 
Conclusion 
In 81 percent of the incidents, the insiders planned their actions in advance. 
Analysis 
Initially, insider attacks were mostly reactive attacks by disgruntled employees. Now 
it is turning into a pre-meditated crime. People are carefully thinking about what 
they want to do, learning the environment, and carefully planning the crime so they 
do not get caught. Pre-meditation also implies that there is more to gain, for 
example monetary rewards. If an attacker just wants to cause loss to the company, he 
doesn't have to plan too much and it is usually a one-time event. If he wants to 
increase compensation to himself, it takes longer to plan it so he does not get 
caught, because he wants the crime to be a recurring event. 
Conclusion 
In 85 percent of the incidents, someone other than the insider had full or partial 
knowledge of the insider's intentions, plans, or activities. These included: 
9 
Individuals involved in the incident and/or potential beneficiaries of the 
insider activity (74 percent) 
9 
Coworkers (22 percent) 
9 
Friends (13 percent) 
9 
Family members (9 percent) 
Analysis 
No matter how good you think you are, there are always going to be others who 
know about what you are doing.You see this all the time in the media after 
someone is caught committing a crime and they interview their friends. There is 
always a friend or co-worker who says, "We always knew Johnny was suspicious and 
was up to no good; this does not surprise me at all."The question is: why didn't they 
say anything? If you want to catch an insider, you must raise awareness among co- 
workers to report suspicious activity. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
361 
Conclusion 
In 31 percent of the incidents, there was some indication that the insider's planning 
behavior was noticeable. Planning behaviors included stealing administrative-level 
passwords, copying information from a home computer onto the organization's 
system, and approaching a former coworker for help in changing financial data. 
Analysis 
A crime is never composed of a single incident. There are many sub-components 
that have to occur before the actual crime is committed. In this case, the sub-com- 
ponents of insider threat are usually obvious actions that can be detected, prevented, 
and acted upon before the actual crime is committed. 
Conclusion 
Sixty-five percent of the insiders did not consider the possible negative consequences 
associated with carrying out the incident. 
Analysis 
There are many things that make an insider tick, but most of them are selfish reasons 
related to the individual. Financial gain, frustration, anger, and payback are all exam- 
pies. In many cases the insider fails to look at the negative actions that could occur 
to them or the organization. This also ties in with the previous conclusion that other 
people, including family members, knew something was going on. Clearly letting 
people know the consequences of their actions and what could happen is often a 
solid deterrent against insider threat. 
Conclusion 
The motive and goal for most insiders studied were the prospects of financial gain 
(both 81 percent). Twenty-seven percent of the insiders studied were experiencing 
financial difficulty at the time of the incident. 
Analysis 
Money is a drug that entices almost everyone to become its prisoner. Money is a 
strong motivator and most people think if they had more money, that all their prob- 
lems would go away. Therefore, it should be no surprise that one of the strongest 
motivators of committing an insider crime is money. There is a reason that govern- 
ment agencies that handle classified information require their employees and con- 
tractors to fill out financial disclosure forms. Money problems can be a big indicator 
www.syngress.com 

362 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
of someone who might commit espionage attacks against an organization. It means 
they are highly susceptible to bribes when approached with an opportunity to earn 
fast money. When foreign governments are trying to recruit spies, money is usually 
the number one incentive and is usually a factor they look at to determine who they 
should recruit. 
Conclusion 
In 27 percent of the incidents, insiders had multiple motives for engaging in the 
incident. 
Analysis 
Although money is a primary motivator, there are usually secondary motivators. This 
is the straw-that-broke-the-camel's-back syndrome. In many cases there is usually a 
seemingly minor event that tips the scales to someone committing corporate espi- 
onage. During analysis, many people ask how Johnny not receiving a three-percent 
raise would cause him to try to destroy the company. What these analysts fail to 
realize is that that was just the last straw. If you go back two years, what caused 
Johnny to do this was his divorce, financial trouble, sick parent, not getting promoted 
three times, and working longer hours than anyone else. Not getting the three-per- 
cent raise just pushed him over the edge. 
Conclusion 
Insiders ranged from 18 to 59 years of age. Forty-two percent of the insiders were 
female. Insiders came from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds and were in a 
range of family situations, with 54 percent single and 31 percent married. 
Analysis 
For every crime, people like to put together demographics of the people who are 
most likely to commit the crime. For different types of robberies, law enforcement 
can tell you the demographic profile of someone likely to commit the crime. This 
helps law enforcement in preventing and investigating the crime because they can 
focus in on a smaller group. However, with the insider, there is no demographic pro- 
file. The people committing these crimes are all across the board. Therefore, anyone 
at your organization could be committing corporate espionage. From the summer 
intern to the 30-year-tenured executive, they all have the potential of committing 
internal espionage. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
363 
Conclusion 
Insiders were employed in a variety of positions within their organizations, 
including: 
9 
Service (31 percent) 
9 
Administrative/clerical (23 percent) 
9 
Professional (19 percent) 
9 
Technical (23 percent) 
Analysis 
This conclusion drives home our previous point that there is no profile that can be 
generated of someone who will commit insider threat. Mmost every position in your 
organization has sensitive information and access is all that is needed to commit this 
crime. In cases where a given position does not have access, it is usually fairly easy to 
obtain that access. 
Conclusion 
As reported earlier, only 17 percent of the insiders had system administrator/root 
access prior to the incident. 
Analysis 
The reason the insider threat is so devastating to an organization is that almost every 
position has more access than they need to do their job. So when someone decides 
to turn to the dark side, they already have access to the information they need. If 
organizations did a better job of controlling access to sensitive data, it would make 
the insider threat more difficult, easier to detect and easier to control. 
Conclusion 
Twenty-seven percent of insiders had come to the attention of either a supervisor or 
coworker for some concerning behavior prior to the incident. Examples of these 
behaviors include increasing complaints to supervisors regarding salary dissatisfaction, 
increased cell phone use at the office, refusal to work with new supervisors, 
increased outbursts directed at coworkers, and isolation from coworkers.

364 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Analysis 
Many organizations say that they wish there were indicators of" people who will 
commit insider-threat activities. The answer is: there are. Insiders that cause harm to 
the organization have visible showed behavioral and professional problems at the 
office. In many cases, organizations never tie these people back to causing damage, 
but this conclusion shows that those people need to be isolated and removed from 
the organization. 
Conclusion 
Twenty-seven percent of the insiders had prior arrests. 
Analysis 
What makes this conclusion even scarier is that most of the employers probably had 
no idea that their employees had prior arrests. Most employers don't perform back- 
ground or financial checks during the hiring process. If someone aces an interview, 
she is hired. However, validating the background and knowing the individual you are 
dealing with are critical. 
Conclusion 
In 61 percent of the cases, the insiders were detected by persons who were not 
responsible for security, including 
9 
Customers (35 percent) 
9 
Supervisors (13 percent) 
9 
Other non-security personnel (13 percent) 
Analysis 
Firefighters are responsible for putting out the fires not for detecting the fires. The 
population is responsible for detecting the fires and calling them in so the experts 
can do their jobs. While this makes perfect sense, many companies don't follow it. 
Many companies say it is the security department's responsible for finding security 
breaches. That is one of" the reasons the problem is so bad today. It is the security 
department who is responsible for dealing with the problems, but it is the entire 
company that is responsible for calling in the problems. Everyone must be trained to 
notify the appropriate people if they see suspicious behavior. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
365 
Conclusion 
In at least 61 percent of the cases, insiders were caught through manual (that is, non- 
automated) procedures, including an inability to log in, customer complaints, manual 
account audits, and notification by outsiders. 
Analysis 
Because many of these attacks are low-tech crimes, in many cases they are detected 
with low-tech methods. Automated devices will help, but nothing can replace the 
analytical capability of a human. Humans must be involved and must perform the 
analysis to determine if there is a problem. 
Conclusion 
Eighty-three percent of the insider threat cases involved attacks that took place phys- 
ically from within the insider's organization. In 70 percent of the cases, the incidents 
took place during normal working hours. 
Analysis 
Your organization is going to be the crime scene of the attack. Many people think 
that these attacks are done covertly in the middle of the night and therefore they 
look for anomalies in access time. However, many attacks are committed during 
normal works hours as part of a person's job. 
These conclusions should help to lay the groundwork that many of the ways 
that people look at insider crime and who is committing these crimes are different 
from what was originally thought. While this section focused on a specific report, 
CEP,.T also tracks computer crimes across the Internet. 
The attacks are increasing exponentially and will continue to get worse. What is 
interesting is that because there are so many attacks occurring and it is getting so out 
of hand, CERT no longer tracks this information. 
Beware of Insider Threats to Your Security 
The next set of information on insider threat is from an article titled, "Beware of 
insider threats to your security." The full article can be found at www.viack.com/ 
_download/200408_cdm.pdf. 
The following are some of the key findings from the article" 
www.syngress.com 

366 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Conclusion 
The Gartner Group estimates that 70 percent of security incidents that cause mone- 
tary loss to enterprises involve insiders. 
Analysis 
When executives ask why they should be concerned about internal threat, this 
statistic is the driving theme. The reason is, it could cost your organization a signifi- 
cant amount of money and potentially put you out of business. 
Conclusion 
Credit reporting agency TransUnion recently stated the top cause of identity theft, 
which the FTC reported as generating business losses of nearly $48 billion in 2003, 
is now theft of records from employers that maintain records on many individuals. 
Analysis 
This is starting to show that the inroads of insider threat are deep and wide. Identify 
theft is being traced back to the trusted insider that is using and compromising 
information that they should not have access to. For any organization that maintains 
sensitive information about their clients, this is a huge concern. If client information 
is compromised because your organization did not properly protect it, your organi- 
zation could have liability issues. Also, many states and the federal government are 
looking at making it a requirement that if you think that personal information might 
have been compromised, you must report it to the individual and potentially to the 
government. 
Conclusion 
Recent FBI statistics show that 59 percent of computer hackings are done internally 
(based only on what is reported). 
Analysis 
A long-debated issue is what percent os attacks occur from within the organization. 
Although the number can be debated, the recent CSI/FBI Computer Crime Report 
states that more than half of all attacks and monetary damage to an organization is 
done by a trusted insider. Regardless of whether you believe the statistic or not, 
insider threat is a huge problem and will only continue to get worse. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
367 
Conclusion 
A source inside the United States intelligence community stated that more then 85 
percent of all incidents involving the attempted theft or corruption of classified data 
involved an individual who had already been thoroughly vetted and been given legal 
access to that data. 
Analysis 
Controlling access is critical, but producing granularity of controls is even more 
important. For classified information to be publicly revealed, it almost has to be an 
inside job, because only insiders have access to the information. Therefore, the only 
way this information can be compromised is if someone trusted either deliberately or 
accidentally reveals it to someone who should not have access. Now if the US govern- 
ment, which takes extensive measures to protect classified information, still has internal 
compromises, is there any hope for small, non-governmental organizations? 
Espionage" A Real Threat 
Many companies do not even realize they are being attacked and victims of corpo- 
rate espionage; and in cases where they do realize it, they are not reporting it. This is 
the basis for the next article we are going to cover, "Espionage: A Real Threat," 
which can be found at: www.optimizemag.com/article/showArticle. 
jhtml?articleld = 17700988&pgno=3 
This article shows that economic espionage is on the rise. 
Preliminary System Dynamics 
Maps of the Insider Cyber-Threat Problem 
The next report is an exercise that was undertaken as part of CERT. The report dis- 
plays the results of what is to be deemed a work in progress. It is important to note 
that it is not a complete report or a finished product. In addition, many of the find- 
ings are based on expert opinion and not factual data. Nonetheless, I though that 
several of the key diagrams from the study were worth inclusion in this section with 
some additional explanation. The full report can be found at" www.cert.org/archive/ 
pdf/InsiderThreatSystemDynamics.pdf 
What is important to note is that all of the attacks included both high and low- 
tech attack methods. In addition, the motivation of the attacks covered the broad 
range. Nonetheless, you can see that the coverage of insider threat and the potential 
damage is very broad.

Do You Really Know 
What Your Programmers Are Doing? 
Anyone with any access to critical data could represent a threat to your organization. 
A key group of people who have a large amount of control in an organization are 
the programmers. Programmers implement applications that are either used inter- 
nally or sold externally to a large number of customers. Backdoors and other prob- 
lems in code could represent a large threat to intellectual property of an organization 
The article "Do You Really Know What Your Programmers Are Doing?" which 
can be found at www.mintaka.com/whitepaper/White%20Paper%20- 
%20Security.pdf, talks about the impact of insider threat. 
What is of interest is the breakdown of human threats. Although human threats 
can be non-malicious and can come from outsiders, many of the threats come from 
insiders. 
How Much Is Too Much Data Loss? 
Finishing up this section, we are going to look at the article "How Much Is Too 
Much Data Loss?" which can be found at http://internetnews.com/ 
security/print.php/3503331. 
This article highlights some of the similar points that we have seen, but it is also 
a good summary of the problem insider threat represents to an organization. 
The following are some of the key points: 
Conclusion 
According to the Gartner Group, 70 percent of security incidents that occur are 
inside jobs, making the insider threat arguably the most critical one facing 
enterprises. 
Analysis 
Although the insider threat is one of the most critical risks facing an organization, 
very few organizations either recognize it or know that it exists. Many organizations 
that I have worked with on insider threat recognize it as a major problem only after 
there is a problem or huge monetary risk to the organization. 
Conclusion 
One out of every 500 e-mail messages contains confidential information, customer 
data, employee data, financial information, intellectual property, or competitive infor-

mation," said Kelly. She offered another way to look at it: a company with 50,000 
employees, each sending 10 e-mail messages outside the company per day, would 
incur nearly 1,000 potential data security violations per day. 
Analysis 
This emphasizes that the problem is occurring on a regular basis and is a part of 
normal business. One of the reasons so many companies suffer from insider threat is 
because it is so difficult to solve. If it were an isolated problem or one that infre- 
quently occurred, it would be easy to solve. However, since it is ingrained in how 
people normally operate, it would require an entire paradigm shift to solve. 
Conclusion 
The Ponemon Institute, a private research company, recently released its 2004 Data 
Security Tracking Study with alarming results. Of the 163 companies participating, 
75 percent, or 122 companies, reported a data-security breach within the past 12 
months. The majority of the companies were Fortune 1000. 
Analysis 
What is scary about this is that only a small percent of companies actually know 
about and detect security breaches. If 75 percent admitted having a breach, the actu- 
ally number of breaches and monetary loss is much higher. 
Conclusion 
A recent survey by the FBI and Computer Security Institute found that between 
2000 and 2003, about 40 percent of all companies confronted an attempted informa- 
tion snatch each year. 
Analysis 
The good news is that organizations are starting to crack down on internal threat. 
The problem is that in many cases, it is too little to late. 
Targets of Attack 
If you do not know what someone is trying to do or target it is hard to stop them. 
Therefore in order to build appropriate protection measures and to understand the 
real threat, you need to understand what is being targeted. After you understand 
what the attacker's end objective is, you can not only build appropriate defense mea- 
sures, but you can also test those measures to make sure they are effective.

Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
If someone is committing insider threat, he is targeting your company; more 
specifically, he is targeting your IR At the center of the bulls-eye is your organiza- 
tion's IP. That is what ultimately differentiates your organization from the competi- 
tion; it is what makes your organization unique and is the financial engine behind its 
success. 
There are different levels and types of IP that can be a target of attack. The 
obvious types of IP that would represent the greatest loss to your organization fall 
along the lines of formulas, source code, customer lists, and marketing plans. This 
obvious, or primary, IP is what forms the core of your business line. If someone asks 
you what your organization does, the primary IP is most likely highlighted in that 
description. For example, if you ask someone what Pepsi does, they would say they 
produce soda. Even in that brief description, their primary IP is identified: the recipe 
and methods for producing their brand of soda. Microsoft produces software. Once 
again, even in a two-word description the organization's IP is quickly identified. 
Therefore, the first step in the protection of your organization is to create a list of 
the primary IP in your organization, minimize and control who has access to it, and 
focus your attention on protecting that information. 
Although primary IP is often the main focus, you cannot lose sight of the non- 
obvious, or secondary, IP for your organization. While it might not be as critical as 
the primary IP, it can still cause damage and has to be identified and tracked. 
Secondary IP is the street address of your building, system configurations, routers, 
access to critical areas, etc. These do not represent the core business line, like primary 
IP does, but they support the primary IP and could still be targeted by an insider. 
To illustrate the difference between primary and secondary IP, let's look at two 
examples. If a pharmaceutical employee takes the recipe for a new drug and gives it 
to a competitor, she is clearly attacking the company's primary IR However, if a dis- 
gruntled employee of an Internet sales company disconnects the primary Internet 
connection so customers cannot get to the company's e-commerce site, he is tar- 
geting the secondary IR 
In both cases, it is critical to know what your primary and secondary IP are 
because they will be the targets of attack. The more you can do to protect them, the 
better off you will be. Although this seems easy, correctly identifying IP is often the 
hardest and most-overlooked area of most companies. I guarantee you if you go up 
to any key stakeholders in the company and ask them what the primary and sec- 
ondary IP are for your organization, they will either miss items or be incorrect on 
what those items are. Sometimes things that seem obvious and straightforward are 
very difficult to identify. Therefore, do not take the task of identifying IP lightly. 
Spend the time and energy to do it correctly because the better job you do in iden- 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
371 
tifying the prospect of attack, the easier your job will be in protecting and pre- 
venting those attacks. 
Just to show you how bad the problem is, let's assume that you have correctly 
identified the IP for your organization. Now ask yourself who has access to that 
information. If you are not scared enough, ask yourself the follow-up question of 
even if you knew who had access, would you know who is accessing the data, when 
they are accessing it, and what they are doing with it. What seemed like an easy 
question is growing rapidly in complexity as you start to develop a plan of attack. In 
reality, the problem of dealing with insider threat is not easy. I often compare it to 
accounting for each grain of sand on a beach and making sure they do not move. 
However, it is worthwhile to make the investment because if you do not, since the 
threat is growing rapidly, there might not be any part of your company left once the 
attacker is done.You have to always remember that the ultimate goal of an attack is 
to cause harm to your company. 
Now that we have looked at the main target, let's briefly examine what an 
attacker could do to your primary or secondary IP. In dealing with what they can 
do, we can map it back to the core areas of security: confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability. After you identify the IR you have to ask yourself what the primary 
attack vector is going to be. Would they try to reveal the information to someone 
who should not have access (confidentiality), modify it to reduce the value 
(integrity), or destroy it (availability)? Typically, the high-end insider primarily 
focuses on confidentiality with integrity as a secondary goal. The lower-end attacker, 
for example, a disgruntled employee, will usually focus on availability with integrity 
as a secondary goal. 
The Threat Is Real 
Insider threat is no longer a fictitious concept that people write about and that you 
see in movies. It is real and it is happening all the time and those who do not take it 
seriously may be hurt by its results. 
Think of the damage that viruses and worms cause to organizations. These are 
attacks that start on the Internet and manage to get through organizations' firewalls, 
perimeters, and security devices and cause severe loss. If an external worm can pene- 
trate an organization with ease, what can someone who is behind the firewall and 
security perimeter do? The short answer is: almost anything they want. Although 
people can argue over the validity and strength of firewalls, IDS, and perimeter secu- 
rity, at least there are some measures in place. When it comes to insiders, there is 
little stopping them because they are a trusted entity. What is even worse than not 
preventing them is not trying to detect their actions. This means that not only is 
www.syngress.com 

372 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
nothing stopping an insider but nothing is watching or recording their actions to 
even tell something is happening. 
As we talked about earlier, many organizations would rather live in denial than 
fix the problem. Unfortunately with a real threat, denial will only cause more harm. 
The insider threat is like a tumor; if you realize there is a problem and address it, you 
will have short-term suffering but a good chance of recovery. If you ignore it, it will 
keep getting worse and while you might have short-term enjoyment, it will most 
likely kill you. 
You might be saying that you acknowledge that the threat is real, but that your 
company is not vulnerable. The reality is that almost every organization is vulnerable 
because almost every organization has minimal if any controls in place and they do 
not carefully control access to data. Some organizations might have some basic access 
controls in place, but that is not good enough. If even one person has more access 
than what they need to do their job, that is too much access. Giving everyone the 
least access they need to do their job is critical, plus putting auditing measures in 
place to track behavior, even if you know that access is strictly controlled. What 
stops someone who has legitimate access from e-mailing it to someone who should 
not have access? Not only do you have to strictly control access, you must also mon- 
itor it. Since too-much access it what leads to ultimate compromise and too-little 
monitoring is what leads to someone not being caught or controlled, both play a 
critical role in your insider threat arsenal. 
More and more organizations are starting to recognize that insider threat is 
important; the problem is it is after the fact. I know of a ton of companies that have 
been victims to insider threat; I do not know of any that have successful stopped an 
insider threat initially. All of our case studies, histories, and knowledge of insider 
threat are after the problem occurs and a company gets compromised. The real 
problem is we are finding out about the problem because of the damage not because 
the insiders are being caught. At least if we caught the insider after the fact we could 
stop that person from doing it again. Unfortunately, we know it is happening but we 
do not know who did it. This creates a double-edged sword. Most executives do not 
believe what they cannot see, so they initially do not take insider threat seriously. 
Then, after it happens and there is critical damage, they ask why no one warned 
them or told them it was a problem so they could have fixed it. 
So far in 2005 it is estimated that more than 10 million identities have been 
stolen, with a loss of more than $50 million resulting from it. What more proof do 
we want that this is a real threat? You might ask what stolen identities have to do 
with insider threat. The answer is: there is a direct correlation. How is personal infor- 
mation taken to steal someone's identity? Through an insider who has access to that 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
373 
information for the company they work for. Credit card fraud and identity theft are 
both caused by insiders stealing information they should not have access to. 
The Bali bomber wrote a manifesto from jail urging terrorists to take terrorism 
to cyberspace. Why? Because he knows that is a weak link that can easily be 
exploited. Organizations and countries have critical infrastructures all stored in com- 
puters. If that information is compromised, it could have the same impact as an 
actual bomb. 
The book Unrestricted Wa~are, by Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui (Beijing: PLA 
Literature and Arts Publishing House, February 1999), which can be downloaded at 
www.terrorism.com/documents/TRC-Analysis/unrestricted.pdf, talks about how 
cyber weapons will become the weapons of the future. The key fact is that this levels 
the playing field across all countries. Who can compete with the nuclear arsenal of 
the U.S.? However, with cyber weapons, all the barriers to entry and monitoring are 
gone. Just think if you put together two or three of the cyber weapons together in a 
coordinated fashion, you would have the cyber version of the perfect storm. 
Insider threat needs to be moved up in importance and discussed in boardrooms 
prior to attacks, not after significant monetary loss. Proactive measures need to be to 
taken to stop insider attacks from occurring, not reactive measures to clean up 
the mess. 
What is scary is there is really minimal skill needed to launch these attacks.You 
really do not need to know anything if you have access.You just drag and drop infor- 
mation you should not be sending outside the company and you e-mail it to a com- 
petitor or a Hotmail account.Years of company IP can be extracted in minutes. Even if 
you do not have access, there are tools you can download and run to get access. If you 
can install MS Office, you can install and run these tools. Unfortunately, they are really 
that easy to use. The days of knowing how to write, compile, build, and exploit are 
gone. These tools are publicly available, free for the taking. 
The sale of stolen IP makes the stolen car industry look small time. It is hap- 
pening constantly and is such a norm, that people do not even realize it. An unpro- 
tected computer is an insider threat even if the user of the system is the most ethical 
employee on the planet. The computer and account has trusted access, not the 
person, and if someone can compromise the system because the person went to 
lunch and left his system unlocked, that is a huge source of insider threat and loss for 
a company. 
We can predict with high reliability snowstorms and severe weather before they 
occur. This early-warning system enables people to prepare and take action to help 
minimize the damage. The reason we can predict weather is because we look for 
indicators using radar and other advanced techniques. We need to develop cyber 
indicators. Some initial indicators that could show a company is vulnerable are: no 
www.syngress.com 

374 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
or weak policies, weak passwords, and no list of critical assets. If we can better iden- 
tify and track these cyber indicators, we will have a better chance of reacting to the 
problem. 
Profiling the Insider 
One problem with the insider threat is there is no single profile that can be used to 
help identify who might be committing these crimes. With other crimes there are 
clear profiles you can look for. There is a set profile for the person who would rob a 
gas station or commit rape. However, with insider threat there is no demographic 
profile. People who have been caught vary in age, sex, social background, and educa- 
tion and cover the entire range of categories of people. 
There was one report that had a profile for the person most likely to commit 
insider threat. The profile was someone in their mid 30s, works long hours, logs into 
the company at night, sometimes works weekends, drinks, smokes, and is divorced. I 
laugh because that covers almost everyone I know. Therefore rash attempts like this 
never really generate anything meaningful in terms of a demographic profile. 
One of the biggest indicators of an attacker is someone who is highly frustrated 
with his company and/or boss and who openly admits to his frustration and dissatis- 
faction with his job.You unfortunately see this all the time, when someone goes into 
work and shoots someone and they interview their co-workers and they say, "Johnny 
always talked about doing this, we knew it would happen someday and was only a 
matter of time."You think, why didn't anybody say anything or the boss do anything 
about it. The problem is in the past people never took this very seriously. Management 
and co-workers have to realize that these verbal outbreaks could be a pre-cursor to 
additional actions and if acted upon early, the crime could be prevented. 
Most of the attacks were never very technical in nature. Based on the wide range 
of access most people have, it is fairly easy for people to commit these crimes. Many 
people committing the crimes have been at the company for 3-5 years, so they are 
viewed as trusted entities. Finally, many of the people committing the crimes justify 
the crimes in their minds and do not fully understand the repercussions of their 
actions. In one case a spouse said, "I knew my husband was doing this but I never 
thought he would get arrested and be put in jail. I wish I had said something 
sooner." In another case, the person blamed the company because he had to get an 
expensive operation and since the company would not give him a bonus he felt it 
was his right to commit the crime. 
The motives for committing the crimes cover a broad spectrum, but the main 
areas are financial gain, revenge, and retaliation for a negative work environment. In 
addition, most of the insiders that were caught got caught because they were greedy, 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
375 
they bragged, or they got sloppy. Unfortunately, this means that the good criminals 
rarely get caught. 
Preventing Insider Threat 
There is no single thing that you can do to prevent an insider threat. The concept of 
defense in depth applies here as it does to all areas of security. No single solution is 
going to make you secure. Only by putting many defense measures together will you 
be secure and those measures must encompass both preventive and detective measures. 
Some of the key things that can be done to prevent or minimize the damage of 
the insider threat are the following: 
9 
Security awareness Employees, contractors, and any other insiders need 
to be educated on how to protect corporate assets. They need to under- 
stand the dangers and methods of social engineering and be careful what 
information they give out. They also have to be cognizant that insiders 
could exist at their company and not only do their part to protect corpo- 
rate assets (for example, locking their workstations), but they also have to 
look for indications of insider threat and report them to the correct parties. 
m 
Separation of duties Any critical job function or access to critical infor- 
mation should involve two or more people. This prevents a single person 
from committing an inside attack. 
[] 
Rotation of duties All critical jobs should have multiple people who 
perform the roles and those people should be rotated through periodically. 
If a person knows that someone else is going to be performing a given role 
in two months, it will be much harder for them to commit fraud or other 
insider attacks, because there is a good chance someone might catch it later. 
[] 
Least privilege Any additional access that someone has can be used 
against the company. Although access is needed for people to perform their 
jobs, this access should be carefully controlled. People should be given only 
the access they need to do their jobs and nothing else. 
9 
Controlled access Access is what someone is going to use to compro- 
mise an organization. The more a company knows what access people have, 
the better they can control it. 
m 
Logging and auditing Organizations must know what is happening on 
their network and this information must be reviewed on a regular basis. If 
someone's actions are not logged, a company will have no idea who did 
what and will not be able to detect the insider. Even if this information is 

376 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
logged, if it is not reviewed on a regular basis, an organization will not 
able to catch an attacker in a timely manner. 
be 
Policies A policy states what a company's stance is on security and what is 
expected of anyone with inside access. A policy is a mandatory document 
that is clear and concise and that everyone must follow. If a policy does not 
exist, how do insiders know what is expected of them? I once knew an 
employee that bragged about making copies of software when he left a 
company. When I questioned his concern of legality and theft, he replied 
simply by saying,"I never signed anything." This information must be pre- 
sented to them in a way that they understand and it must be made clear 
that they have to follow it. 
Defense in depth When it comes to network security, there is no silver 
bullet. No single solution is going to make you sure. Organizations must 
deploy a layered security model, with checks and balances across each layer. 
Look beyond technology Many inside attacks are not technology 
driven. Organizations must realize that non-technology-based solutions 
need to be implemented across the company. 
9 
Archive critical data Any critical information must be properly archived 
and protected. This way all the IP is not in one place if a system gets 
destroyed or compromised. 
9 
Complete solution Any solution that is implemented must include all 
aspects of the company: people, data, technology, procedures, and policies. 
New World Order 
The world is a different place than it used to be. Insider threat is occurring and it is 
increasing at a rapid pace. Organizations that do not understand it or are not willing 
to get on the bandwagon are going to suffer damage and loss. Organizations that are 
going to survive have to realize the threat is real and take action immediately, 
because most likely the damage has already begun beneath the surface. 
Organizations must understand that security is an ongoing task that must con- 
stantly be done and readjusted. Security goes way beyond technology and is never 
complete. There is no such thing as 100 percent security. Which means you will 
never get it right but you have to keep trying to get it close enough. In order to 
properly implement security you must understand the organization's structure, mis- 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
377 
sion, and politics so security can be seamlessly integrated. Security is a means to an 
end but it is not an end state. 
There are some insiders who will do anything they have to in order to compro- 
mise your organization. However, there are a lot of insiders who just take advantage 
of opportunity. They are working on a system, they find a problem, no one is 
watching and they take advantage of it. The determined insider will always be a 
problem, but the opportunistic insider can be stopped by organizations with com- 
prehensive, integrated security solutions. 
Many people, who have been at companies for several years and have been 
caught committing insider threat, were found to have less-than-perfect backgrounds 
when they were investigated. They had criminal records that the company never new 
about. Think of the damage that could have been saved if the company did the 
proper checks prior to the incident as opposed to after. 
If you want to find where the hole is in a tire, you put it under water and see 
where the bubbles come out. Now, we are not suggesting that you hold your 
employees' heads under water until they confess, but we are saying that if you 
tighten down security you will quickly see the problem areas emerging. 
Future Trends 
We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter and felt that an appropriate sum- 
mary would be necessary to cover the future trends that we see occurring in the 
industry. 
Policies and Procedures 
Many companies, from a cyber perspective, lack clear control and direction in terms 
of protecting and controlling access to their critical assets. While companies are 
focusing on long-term strategic plans for their organizations, they need to address 
the critical IP and put together clear guidelines for what is expected of their 
insiders. As we move forward, the lack of solid policies is going to manifest itself 
more and more in companies. Companies that are serious about the insider threat 
are going to realize that the old style of inefficient policies is no longer going to 
work. Therefore, instead of trying to re-work existing policies, companies are going 
to realize that they are going to have to re-write their policies from scratch. 
It is critical with any organization that everyone is on the same page with 
regards to protection of information. Just because you have a policy does not mean 
people will follow it; however, without the policy as the starting point, there is no 
way you can perform consistent enforcement across an organization. While it is diffi- 
www.syngress.com 

378 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
cult, and executives never want to put things in writing, it is critical that a clear, con- 
cise policy with appropriate repercussions be put in place. 
Access Controls 
Access is the gateway in which the insider threat is manifested. Typically, in most 
organizations, access control is poorly implemented and poorly understood. Moving 
forward, companies are going to have to change this. Those that have been burnt in 
the past by insider threat or those that want to make sure they do not get burnt 
moving forward, will have to take the time to properly control access to critical data. 
This is a multi-staged process, involving identifying critical IP, determining who 
should have access to it, and controlling and tracking that access. 
Miniaturization 
Data and critical IP is at the heart of any organization and extracting and compro- 
mising that information is at the heart of insider threat. As technology continues to 
advance, storage devices are going to become smaller and smaller and embedded in 
other devices. Storage devices that fit in watches or pens and that are the size of 
pennies will make it much harder to be able to track and control this information. 
Attackers are always going to take the easiest path or exploit the weakest link when 
they are compromising an organization, and with storage technology getting smaller 
and smaller, the physical attack will become that much easier. 
Even with guards and other physical security measures, it is too easy for 
someone to walk out with large amounts of information. Therefore companies are 
going to have to do a better job of locking down computers. In reality, do most 
individuals at a company need access to USB, serial, and parallel ports on their com- 
puters? The short answer is no. They have backup and storage across the network, 
there is not a legitimate reason we should be handing out laptops and desktop com- 
puters that make it trivial for this information to be extracted. Through software and 
hardware, these devices can be disabled and locked down to stop someone from 
using them in an inappropriate manner. As storage devices become so tiny that they 
can pass through any guard, companies will have to react by implementing a prin- 
ciple of least privilege at the hardware level. 
Moles 
As perimeters continue to be tightened down and new security devices get added to 
the perimeter arsenal, external attacks are going to become more and more difficult. 
As external attacks become more difficult it is not going to be worth the attackers' 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
379 
efforts. They are going to rely more on the use of moles to extract the data and 
cause damage to organizations. Planting an insider as a mole is as trivial as putting 
together a rSsumS, acing an interview and getting hired. Taking an insider and con- 
verting them to a mole is as easy as finding a weakness and exploiting it. Two 
common weaknesses are money and blackmail. It is usually easy to find someone 
who has some financial trouble. Offering them money to help them out is a tempta- 
tion some people cannot resist. In addition, most people have deep, dark secrets. 
Finding out those secrets and threatening to reveal them is another way to convince 
people to cooperate. 
Since moles are so easy and extremely effective, attackers are going to rely more 
and more on this method to accomplish their goals. This is why performing thor- 
ough background checks and validating employees and monitoring them is going to 
be even more critical. 
Outsourcing 
Outsourcing is becoming a norm for companies of all sizes. The cost-benefit analysis 
not only points to the fact that it is here to stay but that it is going to increase in 
popularity moving forward. This section is not implying in any way that outsourcing 
is bad, it is just pointing out that with outsourcing comes new challenges and con- 
cerns that a company has to be aware of. 
With outsourcing, you are taking the zone of insiders and increasing it to the 
outsourcing company. In most situations, any source code that would be outsourced 
is considered IP for the company. Therefore, there is now a whole new group of 
people that will not only have access to the source code but could also make inad- 
vertent changes to the code or create backdoors. Confidentiality can be controlled 
thought NDA, contractual agreements, background checks, and internal isolation by 
the outsourcing company. Integrity checks require that any code, whether it is out- 
sourced or not, be validated by a separate party. Whether code is developed inside 
your company or outside there is the potential that an insider can create back doors 
to cause problems at a later point in time. Therefore third-party testing and code 
review must be performed to minimize the potential damage. 
Porous Networks and Systems 
As new functionality and enhancements are added to networks, they are and will 
continue to become more porous. A more porous network means the number and 
chances of having outside affiliates increase. As more holes are punched through the 
firewalls and wireless and extranet connections are set up, the exposure of the critical

380 
Chapter 11 
9 Insider Threat 
infrastructure increases and the number of potential people who can access critical 
IP also increases. 
Therefore, organizations need to understand that these phenomena are hap- 
pening and build in appropriate controls at the host and server level. 
Ease of Use of Tools 
Attack tools are not only increasing in ease of use but also increasing in capability 
and functionality. In the past, manual methods were required to use tools to gain 
access. In the future, the tools will become completely automated. Now, an insider 
who does not have proper access can gain access through the use of one of these 
tools. Because the landscape is going to continue to increase in complexity from a 
defense standpoint, the sooner that companies can start to defend against the insider 
threat the easier it will be. 
Relays on the Rise 
Attackers do not want to spend money on expensive resources or attack from their 
own systems because it is traceable. Instead, attackers use relays. A relay is a site that 
has weak security; the attacker breaks into the site and sets up a safe haven. From this 
site she can load all her tools and launch attacks. Now she is using someone else's 
resources and if a victim traces back the address it will go to the relay site and not 
the real attacker. This concept is not new, but moving forward it is going to be taken 
to a new level. 
Attackers are going to start to compromise and infiltrate entire companies and 
use them as massive control centers for insider attacks. In essence, corporations will 
inadvertently be sub-funding illicit activity because they have poor security. If I am 
going to launch a massive insider attack, I need resources, I need Internet connec- 
tivity, and what better place to find it than a large company that has redundant T1 or 
T3s and extra servers? In essence, attackers are finding that organizations provide 
them "flee" collocation services. 
You might ask, while a company would prefer this does not happen, what is the 
big concern? The biggest concern with this happening to an organization is down- 
stream liability. This means that if your company has such weak security that they 
allow themselves to be a launching-off platform, they could potentially be held lia- 
bility for being grossly negligent in securing their enterprise. Not only could this 
cause serious monetary issues for a company, but if legal action is taken, the case is 
public and that could result in bad reputation, loss of customer confidence, and loss 
of customers. 

Insider Threat 9 Chapter 11 
381 
Social Engineering 
The weakest link in any organization is the people. Since most insiders had full 
access it has always been easy to just compromise an insider. However, as companies 
start to tighten controls, full access is going to be limited and taken away. Therefore, 
attackers need other ways to get the information or access they need; the solution: 
social engineering. 
Social engineering is human manipulation where you pretend to be someone 
you're not with the sole goal of gaining access or information you otherwise would 
not have. 
Social engineering is a very powerful, yet easy tool at the attacker's disposal. As 
social engineering attacks increase, organizations need to do a better job at educa- 
tion, making people aware, and defending against these types of attacks. 
Plants 
When many people think of insider threat they think that as soon as someone has 
access, they will commit the act immediately. While this would seem logical, it is 
easy to trace and the person is usually limited in access and capability. A good insider 
knows that patience is the key. 
More and more governments are putting plants in competing companies in for- 
eign countries. They view this as a long-term investment, so they will give you a 
fully qualified candidate to work at your company. This person will work their butt 
off for many years, learning the process, gaining trust, getting promoted, and then 
eventually will slowly start to extract sensitive information from the company. 
This model is highly effective and very hard to detect and trace. No one thinks 
that someone would get hired at a company and work very hard so that in five years 
he could compromise data. To many of us it does not make sense, but to the skilled 
attacker or government organization it is a worthwhile investment. 
Tolerance Increasing 
As attacks increase, people's tolerance for pain increases. There are worm outbreaks 
and other attacks that three years ago would have made the front page of every 
paper, but today they do not even get a mention because people's tolerance for this 
type of behavior is increasing. Instead of doing something about it, we are accepting 
it as a norm. 
This model is very dangerous because as soon as you get in the acceptance 
mode, the problem will keep getting worse and worse and no one will notice. 
www.syngress.com 

382 
Chapter 11 9 Insider Threat 
Something has to change; otherwise, the impact of the insider will cause such finan- 
cial loss that it will impact the entire economic infrastructure. 
Framing 
As attackers get more sophisticated, they are looking for ways not to get caught. 
Especially in the case of the plant, if you worked three years in an organization you 
would want to get a lot of mileage out of it and not commit one act of insider 
threat and get caught. The easiest way to not get caught is to frame someone else. 
Instead of using your own identity, more and more attackers are compromising and 
using someone else's identity so that person gets blamed for the attack. If a skilled 
attacker does this properly, he can build up so much evidence against the person he 
is framing that there is no questioning or doubt in anyone's mind who committed 
the insider attack. 
This trend is very scary because now you have innocent people becoming vic- 
tims, in addition to the company. Therefore it is very critical that companies carefully 
examine the facts to make sure they are not punishing the wrong person. 
Lack of Cyber Respect 
It is amazing, but we are raising a generation today that has minimal respect for the 
cyber world. The total lack of appreciation and understanding of cyber ethics is 
downright scary. Many people would never think of stealing someone's wallet, but 
they have no problem reading people's e-mail or compromising their user ID and 
password. 
As organizations put together new policies and procedures, they have to realize 
that they have a long road ahead of them in changing how people perceive and act 
towards information that exists in a digital format. By covering the future trends, you 
will help your organization properly build defensive measures against the insider 
threat that will not only work today but scale tomorrow. 
Summary 
This chapter was meant to serve as an introduction to how bad the problem is and 
why you should be concerned about it. Some problems if you ignore them they 
will go away, this problem will only continue to get worse. It is important that 
organizations understand the risks that insider threat can have, realize it is occurring 
today and take action to minimize or prevent the damage that it can cause.
